# Life history data for banded mongooses in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda (2017-2020)

## Aim and scope
- Describe life history, biometric, reproductive, and environmental data to study fitness and life-history trade-offs, including potential trans-generational effects.
- Data collection supported by a controlled provisioning experiment to compare provisioned and non-provisioned individuals.

## Study site and timeframe
- Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda (0°12'S, 29°54'E)
- Data collected 2017–2020

## Data collection methods and components
- Behavioral and biometric data from eight habituated mongoose groups; most of the population (>95%) marked and regularly captured.
- Daily visits to groups; individuals dispersed in groups, enabling clear distinction between death and dispersal.
- Weather data from a field-site weather station (daily precipitation, min/max temperatures).
- Capture and sampling during live-trapping events:
  - Anesthesia with isoflurane; transponder microchips implanted; DNA (tail tips) collected.
  - Reproductive status recorded (PREG, OES, NONB, PE, BS, or combinations).
  - Morphometrics: weight, various body measurements; ultrasound data available in some cases; foetus count/size when relevant.
  - Blood samples, plasma, WBC/RBC, and other physiological measures collected as per design.
- Life history events tracked at two levels:
  - Individual level: START/END of monitoring, BORN, ADIED, ENDEV, FPREG, etc.
  - Group level: InterGroup Interactions (IGI), synchronous births (BIRTH), etc.
- Experimental design: age- and weight-matched provisioning vs control females within six groups; 18 provisioned females and 15 controls over a mean of 561 days; 71 litters born (average 6.7 litters per female).

## Data structure and content
- Tables and variables span:
  - Table 1. Captures: capture date, ID, pack, age, sex, reproductive status, weights, morphometrics, ultrasound status, drugs, etc.
  - Table 2. Experimental females: pack, individual ID, treatment group, start date, notes.
  - Table 3. Experimental males: pack, ID, breeding status, start/stop dates, notes.
  - Table 4. Life history: date, pack, individual, sex, age category, status, start/end codes, life history codes, exactness, causes, litter IDs.
  - Table 5. Weather: date, rain, max/min temperature, observer.
  - Table 6. Weights: pack, date, individual, sex, weight, measurement accuracy.
- Data categories include extensive metadata for each measurement and event, enabling detailed analyses of life histories, reproductive investment, and provisioning effects.

## Data quality, completeness, and governance
- Data quality processes include systematic marking, daily monitoring, standardized measurements, and consistent coding of life-history events.
- Some data gaps exist: capture and weight data may be missing for some individuals due to escape or missed weighings.
- Metadata and variable definitions are explicitly described (Tables 1–6), facilitating data understanding and reuse.
- Data governance considerations discussed include data sharing potential and the importance of transparent metadata; data collection was led by the principal investigator with collaborators and postdocs responsible for data collection and analysis.

## Responsible persons and project scope
- Principal Investigator: Jonathan D. Blount (University of Exeter) with Co-Investigator Michael A. Cant (University of Exeter).
- Postdoctoral researchers involved in data collection and analysis: Magali Meniri, Faye J. Thompson, Harry H. Marshall.
- Project period: May 2017 – March 2020; goal to assess fitness, life-history trade-offs, and trans-generational effects under provisioning and non-provisioning conditions.
