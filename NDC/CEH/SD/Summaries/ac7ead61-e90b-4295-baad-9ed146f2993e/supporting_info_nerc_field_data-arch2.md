# Data collected on banded mongooses in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda (2017-2020)

## Overview
- Data types: life history (individual and group events), daily field body mass, biometric data from trapping, and weather information.
- Study site and period: Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda (0°12'S, 29°54'E); 2017–2020.
- Subjects: banded mongooses, with eight habituated groups; >95% of population marked and regularly captured for biometric and blood sampling.
- Purpose: to measure fitness and life history trade-offs and potential trans-generational effects; designed as an experiment with provisioning to test impacts on reproduction and related outcomes.

## Data collection and site procedures
- Field operations: groups visited daily; individuals can be unequivocally distinguished between death and dispersal due to synchronous group dispersal behavior.
- Weather data: collected via a weather station at the field site; daily precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures recorded.
- Capture and handling: live traps used; anesthesia with isoflurane; transponder microchips implanted; hair/tissue samples taken for DNA; blood samples drawn within 2–3 minutes when required.
- Reproductive and biometric data: record reproductive status (PREG, OES, NONB, PE, BS, or combinations); palpation to estimate foetus size/count; weights measured in the field (morning or evening); additional morphometrics collected (head/body measurements, limb lengths, tail metrics, etc.).
- Life history monitoring: events tracked at two levels—individual (START/END, CODE for life events) and group (IGI, BIRTH); exact event timing and status are recorded.
- Experimental design: age- and weight-matched females in six groups randomly assigned to provisioned (P) or control (C) categories at study start; provisioning involved a cooked egg three times per week; replacements made if a provisioned female died; 18 provisioned and 15 control females; mean monitoring duration 561 days; 71 litters recorded (average 6.7 litters per female).

## Experimental design and aims
- Experimental manipulation: provisioning vs non-provisioning to assess effects on fitness and life-history traits.
- Sample and timing details: provisioned duration varied; a wide range (min 165 days, max 1053 days) across individuals.
- Outcome focus: effects on life history traits, reproductive success, and potential trans-generational influences.

## Data content and structure
- Data organization includes six tabulated datasets:
  - Table 1. Captures: capture date, individual ID, pack, age, reproductive status, sex, anesthesia used, weights, morphometrics, samples, and related measurements.
  - Table 2. Experimental females: pack, individual ID, treatment group (C or P), start date, comments.
  - Table 3. Experimental males: pack, individual ID, breeding status, start/stop dates, comments.
  - Table 4. Life history: date, pack, individual ID, sex, age category, status, start/end indicators, life history code, exactness flags, causes, litter IDs.
  - Table 5. Weather: date, rainfall, max/min temperature, observer.
  - Table 6. Weights: pack, date, individual ID, sex, weight, and measurement accuracy.
- Variable scope includes broad life-history coding (e.g., BORN, DIED, FPREG, ENDEV, IGI), numerous biometric measurements (WEIGHT, HEAD_WIDTH, HEAD_LENGTH, etc.), reproductive details (FOETUSES, FOET_SIZE, LACTATING, ULTRASOUND), and sample-related fields (BLOOD_SAMPLE, PLASMA_SAMPLE, WBC, RBC).

## Data quality and limitations
- Data gaps: capture and weight data may have missing entries due to escape events or weighing difficulties.
- Measurement and coding detail: extensive variable descriptions and coding (23 life-history codes; 5 levels for some fields; multiple status flags) to support standardized analysis and comparability.

## Responsible parties and governance
- Principal investigator: Jonathan D. Blount (University of Exeter).
- Co-investigator: Michael A. Cant (University of Exeter).
- Postdoctoral researchers involved in data collection/analysis: Magali Meniri, Faye J. Thompson, Harry H. Marshall.
- Data management approach emphasizes verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation of established data sources; outputs are presented in standard formats (reports, maps, charts) and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and analysis
- Provides time-series and cross-sectional data linking environmental context (weather) with animal life history and fitness outcomes.
- Enables assessment of how provisioning and environmental conditions interact to influence reproduction, survival, and trans-generational effects.
- Supports standardized, comparable analyses across years, groups, and experimental treatments, aligning with monitoring goals of data-driven environmental health and policy evaluation.
- Data accessibility considerations noted, with emphasis on data storage in appropriate portals to facilitate broader access for policy and research stakeholders.
