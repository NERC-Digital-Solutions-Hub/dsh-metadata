# Dataset Summary and contextual information

- The dataset provides Above-ground Carbon Density (ACD) estimates (Mg ha-1) derived from forest census surveys conducted from 1992 to 2016 in the Usia Segama Forest Reserve (USFR) and Danum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA), Sabah, Malaysia. It covers a mix of logged and unlogged tropical lowland dipterocarp forest.
- Study area and plot networks
  - USFR comprises 1268 km2 with coupes logged once between 1972 and 1993; restoration treatments occurred 1993–2004.
  - Three independent plot networks contributed data:
    - A. INDFORSUS: 53 plots (0.1 ha each) from areas logged 1981–1993 and unlogged primary forest; relocated/re-censused in 2016.
    - B. Pinard & Putz network: 32 plots (0.08 ha) logged after initial measurement; re-censused in 1996 and 2005.
    - C. INFRAPRO/INFAPRO: 205 plots (0.2 ha) across logged areas; re-censused in 2010 and 2015 for a subset.
  - Data were complemented by logging method, coupe, year of logging, and restoration context from Yayasan Sabah.
- Data quality and provenance
  - Quality control included numeric range checks, formatting checks, and logical integrity checks.
  - Analysis and modelling of ACD described in Philipson et al. (in press); code available at Zenodo.
- Field measurements and protocols
  - Three networks used slightly different measurement protocols:
    - INDFORSUS: plots with 17.84 m radius; all woody plants ≥20 cm DBH measured for DBH, height, and identity; nested plots assess smaller diameter classes.
    - Pinard & Putz: measurements on all woody plants ≥20 cm DBH across the whole plot, with nested subplots for smaller DBH classes (down to 1–5 cm in 25 m2 subplots).
    - INFAPRO: plots defined on four circles (0.05 ha total) with varying nested radii to capture trees in different DBH ranges.
- Allometric methods and carbon modelling
  - Carbon content estimated as 47% of above-ground biomass (AGB).
  - AGB estimated from DBH, height, and wood density using:
    - AGB_est = 0.0673 × (ρ × DBH^2 × H)^0.976
      - DBH in cm, H in m, ρ in g cm^-3.
  - DBH at 1.3 m (DBH_1.3m) inferred when necessary from POM measurements using:
    - DBH_1.3m = DBHPOM / exp(-0.029 × (POM - 1.3))
  - Height (H) estimation via a three-parameter Weibull model fitted to observed data:
    - H = 89.53 × [1 − exp(−0.0225 × DBH^0.7383)]
  - Wood density sourced from global databases; species-identified stems use species-average density; missing botanical information assigned plot-average density.
  - Individual-tree carbon values summed to yield ACD per plot; contributions from small trees on nested plots scaled to plot totals.

- Practical implications for GIS specialists
  - Rich, plot-level ACD data across multiple networks enable spatial mapping of carbon density and its changes with logging and restoration.
  - Consistent unit (Mg ha^-1) and explicit metadata on restoration context, logging method, and timing support GIS analyses and time-series mapping.
  - Data quality steps and the underlying allometric model provide transparent methods for replicating and validating spatial carbon estimates.
