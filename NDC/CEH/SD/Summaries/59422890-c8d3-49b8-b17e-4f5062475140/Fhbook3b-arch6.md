# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a standardized methodology for Countryside Survey 2000, detailing planning, data collection, mapping, and analysis to monitor land cover, landscape features, and vegetation across Britain.
  - Aims to deliver consistent, robust time-series data by linking ground-truth field data with remote sensing and by facilitating policy-relevant analyses.

- Core aims and structure
  - Updates CS1990 (Countryside Survey 1990) with current, comparable datasets on land use, vegetation, and landscape features.
  - Uses a two-tier approach: ground-truth field data (CS2000) and remote-sensing linkages (satellite imagery and land-cover mapping).
  - Establishes standardized field procedures to ensure cross-observer comparability and reliable change detection.

- Sampling framework and survey planning
  - Builds on CS1990’s core sample (508 squares in GB) and expands to 568 squares, maintaining representation across ITE Land Classes.
  - Includes re-survey of previously visited squares for time-series data and additional squares to represent new classes.
  - Six teams (one per ITE Research Station) survey about 95 squares each; typical survey duration ~ four days per square.
  - Emphasizes consistent ordering (old squares in 1990 order) and near-neighbour timing for new squares; flexibility in scheduling and travel efficiency.

- Permissions, access, and field logistics
  - All surveys require landowner consent; coordinators manage access and background information.
  - On-site verification of permissions; plan for replacements if access is refused; protocol for abandoning or partial surveying and documenting access issues.

- Equipment, logistics, and data capture tools
  - Comprehensive field equipment list supporting safety, mapping, and data capture (FABs, GPS, maps, aerial photos, cameras, etc.), with maintenance and reporting of damaged items.
  - A structured provisioning system distributes items to teams and tracks square-specific needs.

- Data recording framework (FAB and coding)
  - Data collection organized around a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) containing maps and data sheets; pages must be neatly completed for accurate analysis.
  - Uses primary CS1990 codes with secondary codes; new or unique codes created sparingly and well-documented.
  - Captures ownership and landowner information to support permissions and context.
  - Aerial photographs may be used for feature identification but field judgment takes precedence.

- Mapping, coding, and change detection (CS1990 → CS2000)
  - Change detection emphasizes updating existing maps (MBAPs and PBAPs) rather than re-recording from scratch.
  - MBAPs (Mappable Broad Habitats) cover broad woodland and boundary features; PBAPs (Plottable Broad Habitats) cover habitats requiring plots for monitoring.
  - Procedures for creating/updating maps, assigning unique parcel numbers, and recording BAP-related codes to maintain temporal consistency.

- Plots, vegetation sampling, and data capture
  - Plot types include X plots (AreA), Y plots (baseline data), U plots (unopened in plottable habitats), B plots (boundaries), A plots (arable margins), H plots (hedgerows), D plots (hedgerow diversity), S/W plots (streams/watersides), and R/V plots (roadsides/verges).
  - Nested vegetation sampling with presence/absence data and percent cover (5% increments) for a core list of about 200 species; standardized bryophyte and lichen lists.
  - Detailed relocation and marking procedures for permanent plots; use of metal plates, GPS, photos, and boundary references.
  - Boundaries are mapped and coded with multiple elements; curtilage rules distinguish urban-adjacent landings from non-curtilage rural land.

- Species lists, identification, and data quality
  - Standardized species identification with a top 200 list and approved combinations for difficult taxa; consistent nomenclature with post-survey name updates possible.

- Data standards, accuracy, and quality control
  - Emphasis on standardization and quality control to support reproducibility and policy-relevant analyses.
  - Clear guidance on handling mosaics and multi-code features; on-site decisions documented; emphasis on reducing re-entry of data.

- GPS data collection and annexes
  - Annexes provide detailed GPS data collection workflow: powering devices, satellite checks, stationary vs. moving feature logging, file naming conventions (e.g., square and plot IDs like 501X4.PSE), data rate, and logging controls.
  - Instructions for handling PDOP quality (aim for PDOP < 6 for 3D fixes) and strategies to mitigate obstructions.
  - Guidance on GPS data management, including almanac downloads and battery management.

- Photography and post-survey procedures
  - Photography protocol: one camera per team; shoot all vegetation plots with reference features; include square/plot numbers on boards; ensure clear, land-feature-referenced frames.
  - After-survey procedures emphasize data completeness checks, retracing data sheets if necessary, and transporting FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

- Section 10 sampling: soil, Calluna, and freshwater components
  - Three sampling types within CS2000: soil chemistry and biology, Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling, and freshwater biota sampling (the latter by IFE staff).
  - Soil sampling: five replicate cores per 1 km square X-plot (center plots of 2 x 2 m); standardized sampling procedure with specific pipe types, packaging, and shipping to ITE Merlewood.
  - Calluna sampling: systematic collection of current-year growth for nitrogen-related analyses to assess deposition impacts; standardized labeling, drying, and dispatch procedures.
  - Freshwater sampling: coordinated with IFE staff, with scheduling to avoid conflicts with field teams.

- Outputs, data integration, and broader context
  - Outputs support longitudinal, policy-relevant analyses and integration with wider environmental policy frameworks; data capture feeds into standardized mapping products and time-series analyses.

- Data dictionary and coding examples
  - The document includes extensive code lists for flora and mosses/lichens (e.g., taxon abbreviations and cross-references), illustrating the data dictionary and crosswalks between old and new taxonomic nomenclature for consistent data recording and future re-coding.
