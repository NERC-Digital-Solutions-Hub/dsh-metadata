# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Standardizes field recording for the Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) to enable robust time-series analysis of land use, vegetation, and landscape change.
  - Builds on CS1990 with standardized field recording to reduce observer variability and improve data reliability.
  - Supports integration with remote sensing and informs biodiversity indicators and policy-relevant reporting.

- Data collection system and standards
  - Data collection centers on Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) that consolidate maps and data forms.
  - Unified coding framework combines primary/secondary codes to describe land cover, habitat, boundaries, vegetation, and use; dominant primary code listed first.
  - Allowance for surveyor-created codes when standard codes don’t fit, with documentation.
  - Mapping focuses on change mapping for old squares and new squares, plus reporting by Broad Habitats (BAP) for biodiversity indicators; ensures traceability and comparability across years.

- Data management, quality and governance
  - Emphasis on inter-observer consistency and standardized field handbooks to minimize recording variability.
  - Documentation, templates, and annexes support traceability, repeatability, and data integrity across observers and years.
  - GPS and geospatial data are integrated to improve spatial accuracy and time-series continuity.

- Field sampling procedures (Section 10)
  - Three main sampling types within CS2000: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling (the latter by IFE staff).
  - Soil sampling
    - Five replicate soil samples per 1 km square X-plot; three samples per centre plot (in each X-plot) using a defined core-based system.
    - Samples collected from predetermined center-point locations; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing; fast turnaround for certain sample types.
    - Detailed packaging and mailing procedures to ensure sample integrity and traceability.
  - Calluna sampling
    - Collects current-year growth (CYG) Calluna vulgaris shoots for foliar nitrogen analysis to assess nitrogen deposition effects and identify regions with elevated deposition.
    - Randomized plant selection within squares; standardized bagging and despatch procedures to ITE Merlewood.
  - Freshwater sampling
    - Conducted by accredited IFE staff; coordinated with CS2000 field teams to ensure non-conflicting schedules.

- Data recording, coding and outputs
  - FABs and field forms are designed for analyzability; strict completion is required.
  - Standardized methods for capturing vegetation, ground cover, and plot-level data; inclusion of sketches, GPS locations, and standardized forms for repeatability.
  - Outputs support time-series analyses, change detection, and reporting aligned with policy needs (BAP maps, biodiversity indicators, SDG-like reporting).

- Mapping, GPS, and photography (Sections 11–12; Annex)
  - Photography
    - One camera per team; photos document vegetation plots, with reference features noted on labeled boards (square/plot identifiers).
    - Visuals are intended to accompany data records for contextual interpretation and future re-visits.
  - GPS data collection (Annex 1)
    - Detailed steps for GPS setup, stationary vs. moving feature recording, file naming (e.g., 501X4.PSE), data logging, PDOP considerations, and battery management.
    - Emphasizes ensuring a minimum number of satellites (PDOP < 6 preferred) and avoiding obstructions; procedures for relaying data to central storage.
  - Post-survey procedures (Section 12)
    - Immediate data verification at day end; avoid post-hoc transcription unless necessary due to damage; transport FABs and samples to ITE Stations promptly.

- Data infrastructure and references
  - Extensive attribute reference lists and coding sheets to map plant species abbreviations to standardized codes, enabling consistent cross-year analyses.
  - Annual time-series objectives rely on consistent coding, mapping, and documentation to track changes in vegetation, land cover, and habitat across CS1990 to CS2000 (and beyond).

- Outputs and policy relevance
  - Data structured to support biodiversity indicators, habitat assessments, and environmental policy objectives.
  - Time-series data enable detection of land-cover, vegetation, and landscape changes essential for government and NGO guidance and practice.
