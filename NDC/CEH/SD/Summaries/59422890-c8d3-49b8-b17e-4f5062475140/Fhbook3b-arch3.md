# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- The CS2000 Field Handbook provides guidelines for the Countryside Survey 2000, extending CS1990 to monitor and evaluate changes in land use, vegetation, and landscape features across Great Britain.
- Aims to produce current, standardized datasets to inform policy, science, and future decision-making, with emphasis on time-series continuity, data quality, metadata, and clear presentation.

## Key aims for monitoring framework authors
- Standardize indicators and datasets to enable trend analysis and policy evaluation.
- Promote cross-year comparability through consistent methods and coding.
- Integrate data from multiple themes (habitat mapping, vegetation plots, soils, freshwater, etc.) into a cohesive monitoring framework.

## Data collection framework
- Three core elements:
  - Mapping and Field Assessment Books (FABs) for standardized data capture.
  - Vegetation and habitat plots across survey squares (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S/W, R/V plots) to capture diversity and structure.
  - GPS data to improve relocation accuracy and spatial precision, especially in upland/unenclosed areas.
- Sampling design aims for national coverage with representative squares, including upland additions and class updates to ensure current land classes are well represented.
- Timeframe anticipates repeat surveys to maintain time-series continuity and comparability.

## Mapping and data capture (FABs)
- Outputs organized around FABs that bundle maps, plots, and codes.
- Two mapping approaches:
  - Old squares: map changes (change-focused).
  - New squares: de novo mapping for new habitats/classes.
- Habitats categorized as Mappable vs Plottable Broad Habitats to capture gradients and mosaics, with field verification and cross-referencing to historical CS codes and biodiversity frameworks.
- Consistency with past CS coding schemes while introducing new CS2000 codes and structured changes (alpha-numeric parcel numbers, primary codes, New Parcel Number fields).

## Vegetation sampling and plots
- Multiple plot types to capture vegetation across landscapes:
  - X plots (200 m2): main/broad habitat assessments.
  - Y plots (4 m2 inner plots): nested species recording.
  - U plots (up to 10 per square): unenclosed habitats.
  - B plots (boundary plots): boundary vegetation.
  - A plots (arable field margins): outer margin vegetation.
  - H/D plots (hedgerows): linear and diversity assessments.
  - S/W/R/V plots (linear 10x1 m): streamsides, roadsides, verges, near-water habitats.
- Plots are placed to ensure habitat representation, with relocation procedures for old plots and new plots in new squares.
- Permanent markers and photographs accompany plots to assist relocation across surveys.
- Detailed plotting rules govern measurement, orientation, and nested data capture to ensure consistency.

## Permissions and access
- All surveys require landowner consent and awareness.
- When access is refused or limited, procedures include abandoning or repositioning plots and documenting ownership/engagement efforts.
- Courtesy to landowners and clear documentation of access status are required.

## Data recording and mapping (core methodology)
- CS2000 builds on CS1990: three core elements are mapping, plots recording, and sampling.
- Mapping emphasizes reporting change in old squares and de novo mapping in new squares; broad habitats align with biodiversity frameworks.
- Emphasizes boundary treatment, minimum mapping units, and field-verified decisions.
- Mapping codes are a mix of primary/secondary classifications, with consistency in FAB layout and coding.

## Mapping in new squares and old-square change detection (CS1990/CS2000 methods)
- For new squares: de novo mapping across broad habitat classes.
- For old squares: focus on change detection, using Mappable and Plottable Broad Habitats to structure data and changes.
- Cross-referencing with 1990 CS codes and biodiversity maps, with unique parcel codes and data-record sheets to track changes over time.
- Special attention to montane habitats and their mapping status.

## Vegetation sampling and plot framework (detailed)
- Plots are designed to capture vegetation across habitat types with standardized layouts, measurement axes, and relocation methods.
- Permanent markers and photo documentation accompany plots for repeat surveys and cross-year comparability.

## Annex: Collecting GPS data
- GPS use is introduced to enhance relocation accuracy and spatial precision across CS2000 surveys.
- Includes practical steps for device setup, data logging, file naming, PDOP considerations, and handling of obstructions.

## Soil, Calluna, and freshwater sampling (Section 10)
- Three sampling pillars:
  - Soil sampling: five replicate samples per 1 km square X-plot; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals, soil fauna, microbiology).
  - Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen concentrations to assess nitrogen deposition effects; random sampling of current-year growth with standardized bagging and posting to ITE Merlewood.
  - Freshwater sampling: coordinated with IFE staff; sampling timing aligned with field surveys.
- Detailed field procedures, packaging, and despatch instructions to ensure sample integrity and traceability.

## Photography (Section 11)
- A camera per team with film stock for photography of every vegetation plot.
- Reference features must be obvious, permanent, and clearly visible in photos; plots labeled with square/plot IDs.
- Photos guide documentation of habitat context and changes for cross-year comparisons.

## Procedures after survey (Section 12)
- Post-survey data validation: check data sheets for omissions; avoid transcribing data onto new maps unless necessary.
- Timely transportation of FABs and samples back to ITE stations.

## Coding and species/habitat references
- The handbook includes extensive code lists for plant species (e.g., ferns, mosses/lichens, forbs/woody species) used for standardized vegetation recording and mapping.
- Cross-reference between old CS1990 classifications and CS2000 updates supports consistent longitudinal analyses.
