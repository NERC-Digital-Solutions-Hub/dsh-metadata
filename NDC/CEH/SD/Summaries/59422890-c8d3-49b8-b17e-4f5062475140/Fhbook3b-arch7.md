# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- GIS-focused purpose
  - Provides guidelines to collect land cover, landscape features, and vegetation data for map-based GIS products and policy-relevant analyses.
  - Supports longitudinal mapping, standardization, and integration with CS1990 outputs for biodiversity and landscape policy objectives.

- Sampling framework and data capture
  - Extends CS1990’s 1 km square grid; includes old squares (changes since 1990) and new squares (current stock of features).
  - Survey conducted from six stations; roughly 95 squares per team; each square surveyed over ~4 days.
  - Outputs designed for GIS use: de novo mapping for new squares; change-detection mapping for old squares; outputs at multiple resolutions.

- Data recording, mapping, and coding
  - Core data capture via Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) combining maps with square plots; entries must be neat and unambiguous.
  - Features described by primary and secondary codes; alpha-numeric codes represent area/line/point features; unique codes allowed for novel features but discouraged.
  - Three primary mapping outputs:
    - Detailed feature maps
    - Broad habitat maps (BAP framework)
    - Plot-level data for upland/enclosed landscapes
  - Two mapping geometries:
    - 1: CS1990-style mapping for Mappable Broad Habitats and Plottable Broad Habitats
    - 2: Plottable broad habitats mapped with broad codes; CS1990 codes reserved for future plots
  - Thematic mapping and data structure across six themes:
    - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal
    - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation
    - Forestry/Woodland/Trees
    - Boundaries
    - Buildings/Structures/Communications
    - Recreation
  - Plot-based vegetation recording with nested plots (e.g., 200 m² large plots with 4 m² inner plots) and permanent markers; relocation protocols to ensure repeatability.

- Vegetation data and species coding
  - Standardized vegetation recording with a core ~200 species list; captures both listed and unlisted species with cover in 5% increments.
  - Special handling for difficult taxa; dominant ground cover codes emphasized; specific handling for certain taxa (e.g., bracken).
  - Detailed, codified species and moss/lichen lists support GIS attribute tables and downstream analyses.

- Plot placement, relocation, and QA
  - Permanent marking (e.g., metal plates) and relocation procedures to ensure repeatable positioning.
  - Location decisions guided by habitat type and center of gravity; potential repositioning in new squares to reduce bias.
  - Emphasis on data quality control, observer consistency, and standardized training via Field Handbook.

- Change detection and CS2000 approach
  - Prioritizes detecting change in old squares rather than duplicating de novo mappings.
  - Introduces Mappable Broad Habitats (Mappable BAPs) and Plottable Broad Habitats (Plottable BAPs) to accommodate upland vs. lowland spatial constraints.
  - Structured workflow for change reporting:
    - Unchanged features marked complete; changes documented with new parcel numbers (alpha-prefixed).
    - Transitions between BAP types recorded with specific codes.
  - Includes documentation for ponds and other landscape features; translation of 1990 CS data to current BAP framework where possible; montane habitats often require de novo mapping.

- Montane and special habitat notes
  - Montane (Sub-arctic) habitats require separate de novo mapping due to translation challenges from CS1990 codes to BAPs.
  - Provides exemplars and primary codes for calcareous/acide grassland, bracken, dwarf shrub heath, fen/marsh/swamp, bogs, montane, supralittoral habitats, inland rock, Machair.

- Annexes, GPS, and data quality
  - Annex outlines GPS data collection, georeferencing, and emphasis on data quality control and observer consistency.
  - GPS data collection procedures include battery management, satellite checks (PDOP), stationary vs moving position logging, and file naming conventions (unique per plot/feature, e.g., 501X4.PSE).
  - Detailed GPS attribute references and an attribute reference sheet to speed in-field data entry.

- Output and relevance for GIS specialists
  - Delivers a codified data model suitable for GIS mapping, with multi-resolution outputs and policy-aligned habitat reporting (BAP).
  - Enables integration of historical CS1990 data with CS2000 outputs, including robust change-detection workflows.
  - Establishes standardized data quality controls, documentation standards, and relocation protocols to support reproducible GIS analyses.
  - Incorporates structured sampling data (soil, Calluna, freshwater) and associated field procedures, photographs, and post-survey handling to enrich GIS datasets.

- Sectional highlights relevant to GIS work
  - Section 10: Sampling
    - Soil sampling across 1 km squares (five replicates per X-plot) for chemistry, fauna, and microbiology; samples shipped to ITE Merlewood.
    - Calluna sampling for foliar nitrogen analyses related to deposition studies.
    - Freshwater sampling by IFE staff; coordination with CS2000 survey teams.
  - Section 11: Photography
    - Standardized vegetation plot photos with square/plot identifiers and reference features; front-facing marker board included.
  - Section 12: Procedures after survey
    - Post-field data validation and secured transport of FABs and samples.
  - Annex: GPS data collection guidance
    - Step-by-step GPS usage, file naming conventions, PDOP guidance, and urban/rural obstruction considerations.
