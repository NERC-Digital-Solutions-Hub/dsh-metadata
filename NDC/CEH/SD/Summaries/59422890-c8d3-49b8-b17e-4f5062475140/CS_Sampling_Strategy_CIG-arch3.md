# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for the Countryside Survey (CS), tracking its development from 1978 through 2007.
- Emphasises the ITE Land Classification as the core stratification mechanism guiding sampling, estimation, and policy-relevant reporting.

## Aims and Approach
- Provide a representative, repeatable sampling framework to estimate habitat areas and track change over time.
- Use stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure coverage of diverse land types.
- Link sampling design to environmental stratification so estimates reflect underlying landscape structure.

## Stratification: The ITE Land Classification
- Land Classification is the backbone of the sampling framework.
- Original system (1978) produced 32 land classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) using 1 km squares.
- Sampling units were centered on the 1 km square grid, with surrounding squares classified to extend context.
- Across surveys, classifications expanded and evolved to improve regional reporting and policy relevance:
  - 1990 CS1990: expanded to classify every GB square; around 40 classes; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 2000 CS2000: Land Classes subdivided to enable separate England with Wales and Scotland reporting; 40 strata became 40+ with country-unit refinements.
  - 2007 CS2007: further Welsh-only subdivisions (5 new Welsh classes) to support Wales-only reporting; overall framework expanded to 45 strata.

## Sampling Design Across Surveys
- 1978 (Initial Survey): eight samples per Land Class (256 total 1 km squares) selected from classified squares.
- 1984 (Land Use Survey): increased to 12 squares per class (384 total) to improve estimates; eight previously visited retained.
- 1990 (CS1990): all GB 1 km squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; retained features from 1984 survey and repeated vegetation/quadrat data.
- 2000 (CS2000): aligned sampling with country units; introduced sub-division and aggregation of classes; added 19–43 additional squares to ensure adequate representation of updated classes; introduced upland habitat module.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-specific reporting requirements led to:
  - Sub-division of certain classes into country-unit versions (England with Wales, Wales-specific classes).
  - 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure robust Wales-only estimates; England paired adjustments due to Welsh additions.
  - Introduction of an upland module (30 additional squares in uplands of England and Wales) for better upland habitat estimates.
- The sampling maps and tables illustrate the distribution of squares across England, Scotland, and Wales and the evolving class framework.

## National Estimates and Country-Level Reporting
- National estimates are derived by combining class-level metrics with class-area proportions.
- Country-unit reporting became a focus after devolution:
  - England with Wales and Scotland reporting units were established (CS2000, CS2007 adjustments).
  - Wales required Welsh-only reporting with additional Welsh samples and country-unit class subdivisions.
- Isle of Man samples were replaced to maintain country-unit reporting integrity.
- A note discusses the trade-off between using the latest classification versus original classifications to maintain cross-survey consistency.

## Upland Module and Policy-Relevant Enhancements
- CS2000 introduced an upland/habitat module to improve accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- The Wales-focused sampling adjustments were driven by policy needs and environmental reporting requirements.

## Data and Documentation Considerations
- The strategy emphasizes repeatable, transparent sampling and clear linkage between land classes and habitat estimates.
- Changes in classification and sampling allocations across surveys affect representation and comparability, necessitating careful cross-walks and documentation.
- The report includes extensive tables and figures detailing the number of squares, strata areas, and sampling rates by survey and country unit.

## Key Takeaways for Monitoring Frameworks
- Stratified random sampling, coupled with a robust environmental classification, provides representative, policy-relevant habitat estimates and a defensible time series.
- It is feasible to adapt sampling frameworks to meet country-specific reporting needs (e.g., Wales, Scotland) while maintaining overall comparability.
- Expansion of classifications and targeted addition of samples can address under-representation in particular classes or regions, though this may impact cross-survey consistency.
- Including modules (e.g., uplands) can improve precision for policy-relevant habitat subsets.
- Documented decisions about classification changes and sampling allocations are essential for transparent monitoring and retrospective policy evaluation.
