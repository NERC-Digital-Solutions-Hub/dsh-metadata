# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose: Assess the consistency and reliability of the Countryside 2000 field programme across multiple components (plot relocation, species records, vegetation cover, landcover mapping, and change recording) to quantify data quality and suitability for change analysis.

- Scope: QA on a subset (38 of 519 squares) from the 1998 CS2000 survey; within each square, one quarter resurveyed recording 234 plots across nine plot types; comparisons with CS1990 QA framework; Annex A/B provide protocols and efficiency measures.

- Key aims of the QA:
  - Quantify field recording accuracy and change statistics
  - Examine plot relocation efficiency
  - Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, plot location, management/seasonal effects
  - Relate findings to CS1990 and assess landcover/landuse mapping accuracy
  - Assess hedge/wall/boundary coding and changes over time

- Methods overview:
  - Selection: 38 squares, one quarter resurveyed; 234 plots analyzed; plot types include quadrats, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, etc.
  - Relocation: plates/markers located via sketch maps, photos, and metal detector; relocation categories tracked (accurate, approximate, not found).
  - Data components: species presence/absence, vegetation cover estimates, landcover codes, boundary features, hedge/wall attributes, and landuse changes.

- Plot relocation results:
  - Of 210 plots fully searched, 28 could not be satisfactorily relocated (86.7% recovery).
  - CS2000 surveyors precisely relocated 60% of the 1990 plots; about 25% relocation was approximate; ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - Y-plots hardest to relocate (23% failure).
  - Assessors located 69.3% of CS2000 plates; overall relocation performance comparable to earlier QA efforts.

- Species concordance and recording accuracy:
  - Approximately 6000 records analyzed; 71% confirmed as present by assessors; about 2% non-concordances due to real management/seasonal changes.
  - Initial recording accuracy around 73%, slightly lower than CS1990 (~78%), largely attributable to plot relocation errors in this QA framework.
  - QA revealed detailed mis-match patterns (e.g., mis-identifications, overlooked species, and location/orientation errors) across plot types.

- Vegetation cover estimates:
  - For the 30 most frequent, six species showed significantly different cover levels between CS2000 and QA; some differences likely seasonal.
  - Overall cover agreement at landuse sample points: about 74% across principal species; notable for grasses and certain taxa.
  - Several species exhibited systematic over- or under-estimation by surveyors; seasonality and plot relocation/orientation contributed to discrepancies.

- Direction of vegetation change (DECORANA analysis):
  - Axis 1 shifts between CS2000 and QA were not significant; no directional bias detected in relation to plot type or landclass.
  - When plotting axis scores versus recorder % agreement, many discrepancies arise from location/orientation or cover-value differences rather than a consistent directional change.

- Landcover mapping and coding concordance:
  - Codes categorized into primary landcover, secondary descriptive, and cover codes.
  - Concordance by code group (mean agreement rates):
    - Primary landcover: 88%
    - BAP (Broad Habitat): 77%
    - Primary boundary codes: 85%
    - Principal qualifying landcover codes: 73%
    - Species awarded cover: 63%
    - Species cover codes: 74%
  - Overall primary landcover concordance (excluding BAP): 91.6%; including BAP: 87.5%.
  - Compared to CS1990 QA (84.3%), CS2000 shows improved overall concordance in landcover coding.

- Change recording and accuracy:
  - Sample of 177 changes analyzed; 16.4% reflect assessor-recognized errors/omissions in 1990 coding.
  - Overall change concurrence CS2000QA: 51.4%; changes not noted by CS2000: 33.9%; changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors: 14.7%.
  - Indication that many real changes since 1990 may have been missed; surveyors tended to avoid indicating changes when CS1990 strings contained incorrect codes or omissions.
  - Examples highlight mis-coding of hedge types, boundary changes, and the challenge of distinguishing real ecological change from coding realignment.

- Hedge diversity and arable plots:
  - Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
  - Arable margin plots: only five plots; very poor concordance (~30.6%); seasonality and taxonomic familiarity likely contributed; recommendation for at least two visits for future arable margin work.

- Additional notes:
  - Landuse and boundary coding show relatively high concordance, but boundary qualifier coding and hedge/wall condition codes reveal some mismatches due to new code categories and local interpretation (e.g., stockproof vs. non-stockproof boundaries).
  - Some mis-matches attributed to differences in boundary status over time (e.g., features no longer present).

- Overall implications for data quality and use:
  - The CS2000 QA shows substantial reliability in plot relocation and landcover coding, with improvements over CS1990 QA in several areas.
  - Key weaknesses to address in future work include:
    - Enhancing plot relocation consistency, especially for small or boundary-adjacent plots
    - Reducing mis-identifications and overlooked species through improved training/verification
    - Improving record of actual changes between surveys to minimize under-reporting
    - Increasing sampling density or visit frequency for arable margins to capture seasonal variation
  - Despite challenges, the QA supports the CS2000 data as a solid basis for change analysis, with quantified error patterns and clear areas for methodological refinement.
