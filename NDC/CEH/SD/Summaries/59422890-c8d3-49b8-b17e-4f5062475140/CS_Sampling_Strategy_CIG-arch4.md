# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Purpose and scope
- Documents the field survey sampling framework and its evolution over the Countryside Survey programs up to 2007.
- Explains how the ITE Land Classification has been developed and applied to stratify sampling, enabling national, regional, and country-specific estimates.
- Emphasises the link between sampling design, data representativeness, and the ability to detect change over time in countryside habitats and land use.

## Core concepts: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling
- Stratified, random sampling is used to ensure samples represent all parts of the population and to reduce bias.
- The ITE Land Classification groups land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to structure sampling.
- Original approach used a centre 1 km square within a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares classified to form a comprehensive framework for national estimates.

## Evolution timeline and key surveys
- 1978 (Initial survey): 32 ITE Land Classes; 1228 central 1 km squares classified; eight samples per class (total 256 squares) for national estimates.
- 1984 (Second land-use survey): framework reused; sample size increased by 50% to 12 squares per class; 384 squares surveyed.
- 1990 (CS1990): all GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; land cover mapping linked with the Land Classification; results published in CS1990 main report.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification): classification expanded to 40 classes to support Scottish reporting; 569 squares surveyed; approach laid groundwork for separate Scotland reporting.
- 2000 (CS2000): introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland); Land Classes subdivided by country units; additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes; a Welsh uplands module was added to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
- 2007 (CS2007): further Welsh-only adjustments; created five new Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure minimum representation per Welsh class; some English classes retained only four squares per class due to precision considerations.

## Sampling framework details and outputs
- CS1978: 256 squares (8 per Land Class) across GB; used to estimate national habitat areas via class means and class area proportions.
- CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class); built on the 1978 framework for broader coverage.
- CS1990: 508 squares; incorporated all GB squares into an updated Land Classification; habitat data collected as in prior surveys plus repeat vegetation quadrats.
- CS2000: expanded to accommodate separate country reporting; 40 strata (later 45 with 2007 adjustments); distribution adjusted to ensure Wales representation; added 30 upland habitat squares for upland estimates.
- CS2007: Wales-focused refinements; Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country; classes subdivided into country-unit variants; total sampling rate and class counts adjusted accordingly.
- National estimates note: changing classifications affects consistency of stock estimates; preferred approach for cross-survey consistency is to use the latest (country-specific) classification for national estimates while preserving original classifications for cross-survey comparability.

## Country-specific reporting and upland focus
- England with Wales and Scotland are treated as separate country units for reporting estimates.
- England, Wales, and Scotland have distinct sampling allocations and class subdivisions to support country-level results.
- Wales required additional Welsh-specific classes and more Welsh samples to achieve adequate precision for Wales-only reporting.
- An upland module (CS2000) added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland areas to improve habitat estimates there.

## Data governance, challenges, and implications for data leaders
- Key challenges addressed: achieving representative coverage across diverse public audiences, obtaining adequate data at the required granularity, and maintaining consistency across evolving classifications.
- The strategy emphasizes:
  - Clear stratification to capture regional and environmental variation.
  - Transparent documentation of classification changes and their impact on national estimates.
  - Commitment to country-specific reporting and the justification for additional sampling where necessary.
  - Integration of time-series data to support change detection and policy-relevant insights.
- Outputs include detailed Land Classification maps and country-specific CS reports (1990, 2000, 2007) that support policy, ecology, and land-use planning.

## Endnotes and further reading
- The document references extensive methodological work and previous Countryside Survey reports, highlighting the ongoing evolution of the Land Classification and sampling framework to support robust, policy-relevant countryside data.
