# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Purpose and scope
- Standardized methodology for the Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) across GB to sample land use, vegetation, and landscape features.
- Builds on CS1990 with enhancements for change over time, linkage to habitat frameworks, and integration with remote sensing.
- Field operations designed to maintain time-series consistency and provide robust, comparable data across observers and years.

## Data governance, standards, and documentation
- Strong emphasis on standardization to reduce observer variation and improve data quality and comparability.
- Quality control embedded through training, procedures, and explicit field guidelines.
- Precise data capture requirements (FABs) with traceability: square identifiers, dates, surveyors, permissions, ownership.
- Explicit CS1990-CS2000 coding crosswalks and documentation of deviations, exceptions, and qualitative remarks when codes do not fit.
- Clear guidance on documenting data provenance and deviations for reproducibility.

## Data collection framework and data model
- Core components:
  - Mapping and land-cover change (de novo mapping, change mapping in old squares, Broad Habitats concepts).
  - Plot-based vegetation sampling using nested plots (Areal, X/Wally; Y2; U; B; A; H; D; S/W; R/V).
  - Standardized plant species list (200 species) with 5% cover categories and nested subplots.
  - Comprehensive coding system for non-vegetation features (boundaries, buildings, roads) with primary/secondary codes.
- Outputs and artifacts:
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) with maps (1:10,000), parcel/plot data, codes.
  - Theme maps, BAP maps, annexed GPS data, and plot relocation records.
  - Linkages across themes via parcel numbers and crosswalks (CS1990 to CS2000 mappings and new parcel numbers).

## Change detection, data quality, and reporting
- Transition from pure de novo mapping to change detection for old squares; distinct approaches for upland vs. lowland habitats (Mappable vs. Plottable Broad Habitats).
- Change marks on theme maps with corresponding updates on data forms and BAP maps.
- Emphasis on reliability and observer consistency; practical in-field decision-making.
- Guidelines for changes management: renumbering/re-plotting, combining/splitting features, mosaics, and cross-class changes.
- Annexes address ponds and erosion data integration within upland/lowland contexts.

## Metadata, provenance, and access control
- Metadata captured within FABs: square series, grid references, location descriptors, dates, surveyors, ownership, cooperativeness, and contact status.
- Clear procedures for permissions, refusals, and alternatives (replacement squares).
- Plot relocation methods documented (metal plates, plans, photographs) to ensure repeatability.
- GPS data collection guidance (Annex 1) supporting precise relocation and georeferencing.
- Production-ready outputs include GIS-ready data linked via unique parcel numbers and CS1990 crosswalks.

## Sampling design and geographic coverage
- Core CS2000 Module 1 plan:
  - Re-sampling 508 CS1990 squares plus additional squares for country units and sub-classifications; enhanced upland coverage.
- Plot-level sampling specifics:
  - X plots (200 m2) and Y plots (2x2 m) across land-cover types.
  - B plots (boundary), A plots (arable margins), H plots (hedgerows), D plots (hedgerow diversity), S/W plots (streamside), R/V plots (roadsides/verges).
- Relocation of plots in old squares and careful placement in new squares to maintain comparability and representation over time.

## Section 10- Sampling
- Types of sampling: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, freshwater biota sampling (the latter by IFE) conducted concurrently.
- Soil sampling purpose: establish baseline soil quality and biodiversity indices for nationwide analysis.
- Protocols detail replicate sampling, locations within squares, and processing/storage at ITE Merlewood.
- Equipment distribution and detailed sampling procedures provided (three soil cores per X-plot, post-sampling handling, and documentation).
- Calluna sampling methodology linked to nitrogen deposition analyses (foliar nitrogen concentration as an indicator).

## Section 11- Photography
- Use of cameras to photograph every vegetation plot for context and reference features.
- Photographs must include square/plot identifiers and obvious, permanent reference features.
- Composition guidelines emphasize plot-centric framing with visible marker boards and minimal sky capture.

## Section 12- Procedures after survey
- Data validation step: read sheets to ensure no omissions.
- Re-copying data to new maps/forms only if essential (prefer not to).
- Procedures for transporting FABs and samples back to ITE stations.

## Annex 1 - Collecting GPS data
- Step-by-step guidance on battery, satellite checks, stationary vs moving feature logging, and file naming conventions.
- Custom file naming (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to reflect square and plot identifiers.
- Data rate, attribute selection, and plotting procedures.
- Tips for ensuring GPS accuracy (PDOP < 6 preferred) and handling obstructions.
- Data management practices for GPS logging and post-processing.

## Endnotes and practical considerations
- CS1990 methods retained with explicit crosswalks to CS2000; some codes may be renumbered in databases but preserved on field sheets.
- Annexes provide extended guidance on GPS data collection and erosion-related data within the broader CS2000 framework.
- The Field Handbook is designed as a practical, adaptable guide to support consistency, data quality, and robust analysis of landscape change and biodiversity targets.
