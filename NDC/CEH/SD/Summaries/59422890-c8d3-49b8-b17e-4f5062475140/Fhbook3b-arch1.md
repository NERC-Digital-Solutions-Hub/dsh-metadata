# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Updated field handbook for CS1990/CS2000 surveys, detailing national land-use, habitat monitoring, and biodiversity data collection.
  - Aims to produce time-series data integrated with maps, enabling policy evaluation and ecological indicators; standardizes observer methods to ensure comparability.

- Sampling framework and survey design
  - Three sampling types: soil, Calluna vulgaris (Calluna) foliar data, and freshwater biota (the latter collected by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff).
  - Survey area organized into 1 km square units; legacy squares re-surveyed while new squares are added to maintain representation across land classes and country units.
  - Time-series emphasis: repeat surveys of existing plots/centres, with standardized plots to enable change detection and cross-year analyses.
  - Soil sampling supports baseline soil quality indices; five replicate soil samples per square for chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiology; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing.

- Field data collection workflow
  - Six teams operate across ITE Research Stations; typical field pace and logistics emphasize planning, permissions, and minimizing backtracking.
  - Data capture integrates field records (FABs), maps, plot-based vegetation inventories, and standardized coding schemes for comparability over time.
  - Mapping and vegetation data are supplemented by a structured coding system (primary/secondary codes) and annexed guidance for boundary, habitat, and feature recording.

- Soil sampling procedures
  - In each square, five replicate soil samples are collected for laboratory analyses (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status.
  - Three core samples per center plot (X-plot) within each square: one long black pipe and two short white pipes, positioned at specific points relative to the plot.
  - Shorter samples are time-sensitive and mailed to ITE Merlewood by First Class post; longer samples are collected by regional coordinators for later transport.
  - Detailed notes and careful packaging (sealed bags, labeled envelopes) are required to maintain sample integrity.

- Calluna sampling (soil-plant interaction monitoring)
  - In squares with Calluna vulgaris, current-year growth (CYG) shoots are collected (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants.
  - Samples are bagged, sealed, labeled, dried as needed, and dispatched to ITE Merlewood for nitrogen-related analyses linked to deposition studies.

- Freshwater sampling
  - Conducted by specially trained IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 field teams; timing coordinated with land surveys to minimize interference.

- Data capture tools and field materials
  - Field Assessment Books (FABs) and maps combine plot-based vegetation data with spatial units; data are recorded with standardized codes and parcel identifiers.
  - Photography: one camera per team; photos capture vegetation plots with clearly visible reference features and plot/square identifiers on a board placed at the plot edge.
  - Annexes cover GPS data collection, pond mapping, boundary details, and other specialized data supports for reproducibility.

- Vegetation recording, species data, and taxonomic work
  - Plot-based vegetation surveys record roughly 200 common species, with percent cover estimates in 5% increments.
  - Emphasis on both listed and unlisted species (with Latin names when needed); detailed handling of grasses, bryophytes, lichens, and mosaics to maintain time-series comparability.
  - Mosses/lichens are captured via a structured annex (with standardized taxonomic references) to ensure consistency across years.

- Boundaries, curtilages, and built environment
  - Boundaries mapped with multiple elements (fences, hedges, walls, banks); stockproof features prioritized.
  - Hedge management states coded in detail; urban–rural boundary recording emphasizes curtilage concepts for field entries.
  - Built environment features (buildings, roads, verges, tracks) are codified with color conventions and specific boundary-related codes.

- Designated and non-designated recreation areas
  - Explicit coding for designated recreation sites (golf courses, camp sites, parks) and non-designated human activity indicators (signs of horses, angling, etc.) to reflect human use patterns.

- Data quality, standardization, and management
  - Strong emphasis on observer standardization, training, and quality control to preserve the integrity of long-running time-series data.
  - Clear tracking of data sources (FABs, maps, metadata); datasets are made discoverable where possible for future reuse.
  - Annexes support reproducibility (GPS data collection procedures, pond maps, etc.).

- Annexes and practical details
  - Annex 1: Collecting GPS data
    - Step-by-step guidance on battery management, satellite checks, stationary vs moving position logging, and file naming conventions.
    - File names encode square number and plot/feature identifiers (e.g., 501X4.PSE); guidance for recording new features (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
    - PDOP guidance (ideal < 6; acceptable 6–9.9); handling obstructions; battery charging and almanac updates.
  - Guidelines for GPS data logging, data rate, and navigation of the attribute reference list and sheets for rapid plot identification.
  - Procedures after survey: ensure data completeness, avoid unnecessary re-recording, and transport FABs and samples promptly to ITE stations.

- Endnotes and practical philosophy
  - The handbook provides extensive rules, decision guidance, and exception handling to maintain consistency across years and observers.
  - Balances field practicality with the need for auditable, standardized data workflows across diverse geographies and teams.
