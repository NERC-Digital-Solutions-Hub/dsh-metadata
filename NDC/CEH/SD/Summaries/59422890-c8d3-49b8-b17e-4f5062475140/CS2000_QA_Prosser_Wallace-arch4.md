# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose: Assess consistency and reliability of the CS2000 field programme across 38 of 519 squares, focusing on plot relocation, species concordance, vegetation cover estimates, landuse/landcover mapping, and changes since CS1990. One quarter of each square was resurveyed, recording 234 plots across nine plot types.

- Aims:
  - Quantify field recording accuracy and change statistics.
  - Evaluate plot relocation efficiency and explain recording differences (observer error, plot location/orientation, plot type, management/season).
  - Relate findings to CS1990 to gauge improvements and consistency.
  - Assess mapping accuracy (primary/qualifying landcover codes, BAPs) and boundary features.
  - Examine change detection reliability and its implications for long-term monitoring.

- Methods and scope:
  - Sample: 38 squares; 234 plots re-recorded (nine plot types, including quadrats and linear plots such as road verges and streamsides).
  - Relocation: Used buried plates, sketches, photographs, and sometimes metal detectors; assessors later evaluated relocation success.
  - Data collected: species presence/absence, percentage cover for principal species, landcover codes (primary/secondary/cover), boundary features, and landuse changes. Annex B details dates and efficiency data by square.
  - Comparison framework: CS2000 surveys vs QA assessments; evaluation of change, alignment of plots, and consistency of coding.

- Key findings

  - Plot relocation
    - Relocation success: 86.7% of 210 plots fully relocatable; 60% relocated precisely, ~25% approximately, ~15% failed.
    - 4 m Habitat Plots hardest to relocate (23% failure).
    - Plate recovery by assessors: 69.3% successful; overall recovery could be 40–45% if including close approximations; eight years after burial did not prevent relocation as well as after 12 months in the previous QA.
    - Overall implication: CS2000 teams could locate about 60% of plots exactly, with substantial proximity for many others, but location/orientation errors occurred in several cases.

  - Species concordance
    - Concordance: ~71% of records confirmed as present at resurvey; ~2% due to management/seasonal changes between surveys.
    - Overall initial field recording accuracy: ~73%, slightly lower than CS1990 due to relocation/location errors.
    - Species richness: mean per plot CS2000 = 17.9; QA = 20.4; QA often produced longer species lists.
    - Pattern: ranking of plot richness largely preserved across CS2000 vs QA; some plot types shifted in richness (e.g., road verges vs streamsides).
    - Common issues: mis-identifications (notably grasses such as Poa, Agrostis, Rumex, Ranunculus, Stellaria) and over-/under-recording of certain species; mosses often under-recorded; seasonal effects influenced some discrepancies.
    - Measures of agreement: several mis-match types quantified (mis-id, overlooked species, orientation/location errors, management/season effects); overall mis-match contributions varied by plot type.

  - Vegetation cover
    - Agreement on cover: generally good, but several grass species showed significant cover discrepancies (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Elymus repens, Arrhenatherum elatius, Eriophorum vaginatum) often linked to seasonal timing.
    - Statistical notes: some significant differences between CS2000 and QA covers (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum) with varying levels of significance; other species showed non-significant differences.
    - Overall takeaway: cover estimates were broadly consistent, but certain taxa and seasonal timing influenced discrepancies.

  - Change in frequency of prevalent species
    - Frequencies of common species generally ordered similarly between CS2000 and QA, but mosses and several grasses exhibited more discrepancies.
    - Some over-recording (e.g., Poa trivialis) and under-recording (e.g., certain grasses) patterns noted; species identity challenges contributed to variability.

  - Landcover mapping and boundary coding
    - Primary landcover codes: high concordance between CS2000 and QA; overall primary land cover agreement ~87.5% (excluding BAPs), ~91.6% concordance when BAPs excluded; 1990 QA value ~84.3% for comparison.
    - BAP codes: lower concordance (~77.4%), reflecting broader habitat typology challenges.
    - Land-use sample point vegetation: concordance ~63.0%; certain common species (e.g., Lolium perenne) were easier to identify; some notable discrepancies for less distinctive taxa.
    - Primary boundary features: high consistency; overall boundary concordance ~85–92% depending on measure; hedge/wall coding and stockproof status showed good reliability, with some divergence in wall condition coding (codes 306 vs 307) and occasional misclassification of hedge types.
    - Boundary height and stockproof status: high agreement, minor omissions; no evident directional bias.

  - Change recording (since 1990)
    - Change concordance overall: ~51.4%; substantial portion of changes noted by CS2000 were not substantiated by QA assessors, and many changes assessed as real were not noted by CS2000.
    - A large proportion of changes may have been missed or mis-coded, suggesting cautious use of change data without corroborating field verification.
    - Common issue: reluctance to indicate changes when CS1990 strings contained incorrect codes or omissions; some spurious changes or deletions observed (e.g., hedge type changes that did not reflect actual change).

  - Hedge diversity plots
    - Total species: 124; common species 92; overall agreement ~74.2% with surveyor efficiency ~77.4%.
    - Hedge plots tended to record more species by QA, indicating under-sampling or selective emphasis in the field.

  - Arable plots
    - Only five arable plots; concordance extremely poor; seasonality and unfamiliarity with ruderal species contributed to mis-matches; recommendation for multiple visits if arable margins are a focus.

  - Overall patterns and bias
    - Across plot types and landclasses, no consistent directional bias detected in axis scores of the DECORANA ordination between CS2000 and QA.
    - Mean axis scores: CS2000 = 387.8, QA = 392.0; no significant overall difference (no directional bias).
    - By landclass, no significant location shift between CS2000 and QA within any landclass, reinforcing general consistency across the data set.

- Implications for Data Leaders

  - Data quality and governance
    - Robust QA processes are essential for large, multi-collector field data programmes to quantify location/orientation errors, identification accuracy, and coverage estimates.
    - Detailed metadata on plot relocation success, orientation, and confidence in each data point is critical for downstream analyses and trend detection.

  - Data standards and interoperability
    - High concordance for primary landcover codes and boundaries demonstrates value of standardized coding schemes; BAP codes and hedgerow/wall classifications may require clearer guidelines and training.
    - The variability in change recording highlights the need for explicit change-capture protocols and reconciliation processes between survey and QA teams.

  - Data lifecycle and discoverability
    - The study underscores the importance of documenting data provenance, versioning, and QA results to support reproducibility and cross-year comparisons.
    - For long-term networks, maintaining plot identifiers, exact locations, and change histories is vital for detecting true environmental change vs. recording noise.

  - User needs and governance
    - Findings support a co-ownership approach to data products, with feedback loops between survey teams and data custodians to improve field methods, coding schemes, and data updates.
    - The balance between field effort (e.g., locating and verifying plots) and data quality must be managed, with explicit confidence metrics attached to different data elements.

- Conclusion
  - The Countryside Survey 2000 QA exercise demonstrates generally strong data consistency across multiple dimensions (plot relocation, species presence, cover estimates, landcover mapping, and boundary features), with notable exceptions in change recording and certain taxonomic identifications.
  - The results provide a detailed benchmark for data quality, identify areas for methodological improvement, and offer actionable insights for data leaders seeking robust, interoperable, and well-documented data assets in policy, research, and partner networks.
