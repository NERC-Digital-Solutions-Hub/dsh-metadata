# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Establish standardized guidelines for Countryside Survey data collection to monitor environmental conditions over time (land use, habitats, vegetation, landscape change across Great Britain).
  - Build time-series datasets linking ground truth with remote sensing and policy-relevant frameworks; enable cross-year comparisons and data integration.
  - Use a standardized 1 x 1 km square sampling framework, with repeat sampling and standardized recording to improve statistical reliability and policy scrutiny.
  - Outputs include datasets, maps, and plots stored in appropriate data portals for policy and environmental health assessment.

- Monitoring design and outputs
  - National, spatially referenced monitoring across GB using a consistent square-based framework (CS2000).
  - Focus on environmental health indicators and policy performance over time; datasets are intended to be reusable beyond a single use.

- Data collection responsibilities and collaboration
  - Three sampling types are conducted within CS2000: soil sampling, Calluna (heather) sampling, and freshwater biota sampling.
  - Soil and Calluna sampling are conducted by CS2000 field surveyors; freshwater sampling is conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff in coordination with CS2000.

- Soil sampling (Section 10.3–10.7)
  - Five replicate soil samples per square, collected from the same 1 km square as other CS2000 plots.
  - Analyzed for pH, loss on ignition, and heavy metal concentrations; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing and storage.
  - Sampling involves three cores per X-plot centre: one long (black pipe) and two short (white pipes), with specific depths and handling to preserve sample integrity.
  - Fast turnaround is critical for two short pipes (soil fauna diversity and microbiological status); these are posted immediately, while the long core is collected by regional coordinators.
  - Equipment and packaging are distributed to regional teams with explicit packing instructions (envelopes, bags, pipes, end caps, etc.).

- Calluna sampling (Section 10.8–10.10)
  - Foliar nitrogen concentrations from Calluna vulgaris are collected to identify regions with nitrogen deposition above empirically derived critical loads.
  - For each square containing Calluna vulgaris, collect current year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants, seal in labeled bags, and despatch to ITE Merlewood.
  - Clear labeling, random sampling from patches, and careful handling to avoid sample degradation.

- Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11)
  - Coordinated sampling with IFE staff; work scheduled to avoid conflicts with soil/Calluna sampling.
  - IFE liaison ensures appropriate timing and data quality for freshwater biota data.

- Photography (Section 11)
  - One camera per team; document vegetation plots with films, highlighting general appearance and reference features.
  - Include square and plot identifiers on a prominent board within each photograph; ensure features are obvious, permanent, and within range for future visits.
  - Aim for composition that shows up to half the frame with the plot; avoid excessive sky; reference features should be legible.

- Procedures after survey (Section 12)
  - Review data sheets at day’s end to ensure no omissions.
  - Transcribing data to new maps is discouraged unless necessary due to damage; prioritize original forms.
  - Arrange prompt transport of field activity forms (FABs) and samples back to ITE stations.

- GPS data collection (Annex 1)
  - Step-by-step GPS use, including battery checks, satellite counts, and recording stationary versus moving features.
  - File naming convention: each plot/feature stored with a unique file name combining square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE); mobile feature files use designated formats (e.g., 501F1.MOB) with clear notes.
  - Data logging settings: specify sampling rate (1 second), logging controls (start/stop), and how to handle stationary plot coordinates.
  - PDOP guidance: aim for 3D PDOP below 6 for good accuracy; obstructed views require adjustments (repositioning antenna, elevated aerial).
  - Equipment handling and keypad usage: detailed instructions for Magellan keypad input and navigation through attribute lists.
  - Recording stationary plot locations requires clear sky views and an unobstructed position; allow 3–5 minutes of recording to improve fix reliability.

- Documentation and data integrity
  - Emphasis on verification, quality assurance, data cleaning, and transformation to ensure outputs are reliable and suitable for long-term monitoring and policy scrutiny.
  - Clear procedures for data storage and uploading to appropriate data portals to support accessibility and reuse.

- Data interoperability and challenges highlighted
  - Importance of integrating soil, vegetation, freshwater, and GPS data to create cohesive environmental health indicators.
  - Need to maximize dataset value by enabling access to underlying data and avoiding single-use outputs.
