# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Purpose and scope
- Evaluate consistency and reliability of CS2000 fieldwork across major components:
  - Plot relocation efficiency
  - Species concordance (reproducibility of records)
  - Reliability of percentage cover estimates
  - Directional bias in habitat change detection
  - Comparability with CS1990 survey
  - Accuracy of landuse mapping
  - Efficiency of recording changes
- Sample: 38 of 519 squares; within each, one quarter resurveyed (234 species plots across 9 plot types).

## Methods and scope of QA
- QA exercise design
  - Relocation and re-recording of plots using the CS2000 protocol and Annex A/B procedures
  - Focus on plate (plot corner marker) and plot relocation for eight plot types (quadrats, X/Y/U/S/R/B/D, hedge-related plots)
  - Comparison with original 1990 CS data where applicable
- Data recovery and categorization
  - Four relocation categories for surveyors and assessors
  - Separate analyses for plate/plot relocation, species concordance, vegetation cover, landcover coding, hedge diversity, arable plots, and changes in land use
- Output measures
  - Concordance between CS2000 and QA (TI vs T2 variations)
  - Mean species per plot
  - Cover estimates and their statistical comparisons
  - Landcover code concordance (primary, secondary, BAPs, boundaries)
  - Change concordance and detection accuracy

## Key findings

### Plot relocation
- 210 CS2000 plots were targeted for relocation across squares
- Plate and plot relocation success:
  - Approximately 60% accurately relocated
  - About 25% relocated but not precisely, ~15% inadequately relocated
- Plate recovery by assessors: 69.3% of plates located
- 1991 QA (CS1990) recovery: 65.2% (comparison shows eight-year relocation is feasible)
- Overall, relocation performance varied by plot type; U-plots were most difficult to relocate

### Species concordance
- Total records analyzed: ~6,000 across 210 plots in 38 squares
- Concordance at the time of QA:
  - 71% of records were confirmed as present by assessors at resurvey
  - About 2% non-concordances due to real changes (management/seasonal effects)
  - Estimated initial recording accuracy around 73% (slightly lower than CS1990 due to plot relocation effects)
- QA vs. CS2000: QA often produced longer species lists per plot (mean per-plot species increased from CS2000 17.9 to QA 20.4)
- Change direction analysis (DECORANA) showed no directional bias overall

### Vegetation cover
- Comparison of cover estimates for principal species showed both agreement and differences
  - Several common grasses had significantly different covers between CS2000 and QA (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Eriophorum vaginatum)
  - Some differences attributable to seasonality or plot location/orientation rather than systematic bias
- Overall, cover estimates were generally aligned across many species, but notable species-specific discrepancies existed

### Landcover mapping and coding
- Landcover code concordance across mappings:
  - Primary landcover codes: high agreement; overall primary land cover agreement around 87.5%
  - BAP codes: slightly lower agreement (~77.4%) due to broader habitat categories
  - Primary boundary codes: high agreement (about 85%); boundary qualifiers showed strong concordance (~82.9%)
  - Overall landcover mapping elements: high concordance with CS1990 QA benchmarks
- Boundary features
  - Hedge/wall coding and boundary shape have substantial but variable agreement
  - Some mis-matches linked to new coding schemes and occasional misapplication of codes for boundaries

### Recording of change (since 1990)
- Change concordance between CS2000 and QA: 51.4% overall
- Changes noted by CS2000 but not substantiated by QA: 14.7%
- Changes observed by QA but not noted by CS2000: 33.9%
- Substantial proportion of changes since 1990 appear to have been missed or misrepresented in the CS2000 data
- Most discrepancies stem from location/orientation issues and interpretation in data entry, rather than simple coding errors

### Hedge diversity plots
- 19 hedge diversity samples; total species recorded: 124; common species: 92
- Agreement: 74.2%; Surveyor efficiency: 77.4%
- Mean number of species per hedge plot: CS2000 5.16 vs QA 5.89

### Arable plots
- Five arable margin plots examined; concordance extremely poor
- Seasonality and unfamiliarity with ruderal species contributed to mis-recording
- Recommendation: consider two visits at different times to improve reliability for arable margins

### Overall patterns and interpretation
- Across plot types, major sources of error involve plot location/orientation, overlooked species, and inconsistencies in cover coding
- Landcover mapping and boundary coding are relatively robust, with high concordance to CS1990 QA benchmarks
- Change detection between 1990 and 1998 requires improved field verification and coding discipline
- No overall directional bias detected in mean axis scores of the DECORANA ordination between CS2000 and QA

## Implications for data support and data products
- Data quality improvements
  - Strengthen plot marker practices and plate stability to reduce relocation errors
  - Improve standardization and training for species identification in vegetative states
  - Enhance documentation and cross-checking of boundary and hedge codes to reduce boundary-related misclassifications
  - Implement structured procedures to capture changes reliably, including explicit change verification steps
- Data product considerations
  - Provide QA-derived metrics alongside datasets (concordance rates, mean species per plot, cover agreement, boundary/code concordance)
  - Include per-plot diagnostics for location accuracy, orientation, and sampling effort to support self-serve analyses
  - Document seasonality effects and potential timing biases in vegetation coding to support interpretation
  - Maintain clear mappings between CS2000 codes and QA codes, with notes on any code changes or new categories (e.g., hedge/boundary classifications)
- For decision-making and policy use
  - Use QA metrics to qualify confidence in detected habitat changes
  - Prioritize plots with high relocation uncertainty or significant change indicators for follow-up visits

## Conclusion
- The CS2000 QA exercise demonstrates generally strong mapping and boundary coding performance, with high concordance to CS1990 QA benchmarks
- However, notable challenges remain in plot relocation accuracy, detection and recording of changes, and some species-specific cover estimates
- The exercise provides a robust framework and quantitative benchmarks to improve data collection, coding standards, and the reliability of data products for monitoring countryside habitat change.
