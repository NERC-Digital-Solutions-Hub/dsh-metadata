# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Emphasizes a long-running, time-series approach linked to the ITE Land Classification, essential for detecting change over 30 years.
  - Highlights the importance of representativeness through stratified sampling and the need to understand methodology to compare across surveys.

- Core concepts for data governance
  - ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework: environmental attributes underpin strata that guide sample allocation.
  - Stratified, random sampling to minimize bias and ensure all parts of the population are represented.
  - Every survey year builds on previous classifications but may modify classes to improve relevance and country-specific reporting.
  - Documentation and traceability are critical: versions of the Land Classification, sample allocations, and country-specific reporting must be recorded for comparability.

- Land Classification (ITE Land Classification)
  - originated in 1970s; used to classify land into 32 classes (later expanded to 40, then 45).
  - initial approach classified 1 km squares (center squares of a 15x15 km grid) and surrounding squares to form the sampling frame.
  - classifications drive the distribution and characteristics of samples and national estimates.
  - over time, classification evolved to accommodate separate reporting for England & Wales, Scotland, and later Wales-only and upland modules.

- Sampling framework across major surveys
  - CS1978 (initial): 256 squares (8 per Land Class) across GB.
  - CS1984: expanded sampling to 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - CS1990: refined to classify every square in GB using an updated Land Classification; 508 squares surveyed.
  - CS2000: further refinement to support separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland); added samples to ensure adequate class representation; introduced sub-divisions and aggregations to create 40 strata and then 45.
  - CS2007: Welsh reporting needs driven additional Welsh classes and sampling; Wales became the most intensively sampled country unit; introduced country-unit sub-classes and adjusted sampling to maintain representation; upland habitat module added to improve estimates in uplands.

- Country-specific reporting and uplands module
  - Separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) required adjustments to sampling and classification to improve precision for each country.
  - Wales required more Welsh-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and additional Welsh samples.
  - England did not receive extra English samples to compensate for Welsh additions, with some classes slightly under-sampled.
  - Uplands module added in CS2000 to improve habitat estimates for uplands in England and Wales.

- Data documentation, quality, and outputs
  - Data include field observations of habitat types, land cover, and other environmental features collected per selected squares.
  - National estimates derived by combining per-square data with class-area information; consistency depends on using a transparent, versioned Land Classification.
  - Output materials include main reports, country-specific results, and maps; ongoing need for metadata to enable cross-year comparability.

- Practical implications for data stewardship
  - Versioned data management: store and index Land Classification versions and the corresponding country-unit maps and sample allocations.
  - Provenance and lineage: maintain clear records of which classification and which survey year produced each estimate.
  - Crosswalks and comparability: where classifications change, provide crosswalks or documentation to enable valid time-series comparisons.
  - Metadata completeness: capture sampling design details (number of squares per class, country allocations, upland module inclusion) and any deviations from the plan.
  - Access and reuse: ensure historical CS data and classifications are accessible with their context (year, classification version, country unit) for future analyses and governance.

  - The document includes detailed figures, tables, and historical narrative outlining the evolution of the Land Classification and sampling framework across CS1978–CS2007, along with acknowledgements and further reading.
