COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

# Summary for Data Stewards

- Purpose and scope
  - Quality Assurance (QA) exercise to quantify consistency and reliability of CS2000 field work amid multiple recorders.
  - Sub-sample: 38 of 519 squares from 1998; one quarter of each square resurveyed, recording 234 plots across nine plot types.
  - Aims: assess plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, accuracy of percentage cover, bias in habitat change detection, comparability with CS1990, land-use mapping accuracy, and change-detection reliability.

- Plot relocation and plate accuracy
  - Relocation success: 86.7% of full-search plots satisfactorily relocated; 60% accurately relocated; ~25% relocated with difficulty; ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - Y-plots (habitat plots) hardest to relocate (23% failure).
  - Plate and plot location: 69.3% of plates recovered by assessors; 60% of CS2000 plots accurately relocated; ~40–45% total recovery when including near-misses.
  - Compared with 1991 CS1990 QA, relocation performance was broadly similar, indicating eight-year relocation feasibility but with notable challenges.

- Species concordance and recording accuracy
  - Overall, around 71% of CS2000 species records were confirmed by QA; approximately 2% attributed to real changes (management/season) between surveys.
  - Estimated initial field-recording accuracy around 73%, slightly lower than CS1990 (~78%), largely due to plot-location mislocations in CS2000.
  - QA identified mis-identifications (notably Poa and Agrostis species), overlooked species, and orientation/location errors as major error sources.
  - QA suggests the mean number of species per plot increased in QA (20.4) versus CS2000 (17.9), largely due to longer lists produced by assessors.

- Vegetation cover estimates
  - Comparisons of cover for the 30 most frequent species show overall agreement; sampling differences exist for several grasses and grass-like species.
  - Significant differences between CS2000 and QA for certain species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Arrhenatherum elatius, Eriophorum vaginatum), often linked to seasonal effects.
  - For several species, QA assessments produced higher cover values than CS2000, but overall patterns show reasonable consistency across plot types.

- Change in vegetation and direction of change
  - DECORANA ordination shows the overall axis shift between CS2000 and QA was not significant; no systematic directional bias in recorded changes.
  - Plot-type analyses largely show random, not directional, differences in axis scores.
  - However, a substantial portion of changes recorded by CS2000 were not corroborated by QA, and about half of observed changes were not substantiated by QA assessors, indicating under-recording of actual changes or over-recording of spurious changes.

- Land-use and land-cover mapping
  - Codes categorized into primary land-cover, secondary descriptive, and cover codes; mapping accuracy assessed at point locations.
  - Primary land-cover concordance (excluding BAP codes): high, around 91.6% concordance; including BAP, overall primary land-cover agreement ~87.5%.
  - BAP codes: concordance somewhat lower (77.4%); mapping still generally reliable with caveats about larger habitat lenses and boundary amendments.
  - Primary boundary features: very high concordance overall (about 92% code concordance; 85–85% basic concordance), indicating strong consistency in boundary feature recording.
  - Hedge and wall attributes: boundary-related codes showed moderate concordance (67.5%), with some systematic misclassifications (e.g., hedge shapes and wall conditions) and occasional omissions.
  - Land-use changes (changes since 1990): concordance low (51.4%); substantial portion of changes were not noted by CS2000 or not substantiated by QA; indicates difficulty in reliably capturing change and a potential reliance on plot data for evaluation.

- Arable plots
  - Very few arable margin plots (five) examined; concordance was poor, with substantial seasonality affecting weed flora and ruderal species identification.
  - Recommendation: for arable margins, plan multiple well-spaced visits to improve reliability.

- Hedge diversity plots
  - 124 total species recorded; 74.2% agreement between CS2000 and QA; surveyor efficiency ~77.4%.
  - Hedge plots tended to be treated as afterthoughts, leading to higher observed discrepancies in certain woody species.

- Arising implications for data governance and stewardship
  - Location accuracy and plot relocation are critical drivers of downstream data quality (species lists, cover estimates, and change detection).
  - Seasonal effects and plot orientation/placement significantly impact data concordance; metadata should capture timing, plot type, and relocation confidence.
  - Land-cover coding is robust for broad categories but sensitive to boundary definitions and boundary-change interpretation; BAP coding improves practicality but requires careful boundary updates.
  - Change detection data are less reliable without robust corroboration; emphasis should be on documenting uncertainties and including QA-derived confidence metrics.
  - Comprehensive documentation of data collection protocols, codebooks, and QA procedures is essential for reproducibility and future data sharing.

- Practical data governance actions and metadata considerations
  - Maintain versioned datasets for CS2000 and QA comparisons, with explicit lineage (CS2000 vs QA data) and change logs.
  - Include detailed metadata on plot relocation success, plate recovery, and location accuracy (e.g., distance from original plate, orientation errors) to inform uncertainty.
  - Publish per-square QA metrics (efficiency, agreement, and notable discrepancies) to aid users in interpreting data reliability.
  - Standardize land-cover and boundary coding schemas, including BAP and hedge/wall codes, with clear guidelines on updates when boundaries or land-use types change.
  - Document seasonality and management events that may influence species presence and cover, to contextualize discrepancies.
  - Where change data are crucial, provide ancillary evidence or confidence intervals indicating likelihood of real change versus recording error.

- End notes for data stewardship
  - The CS2000 QA exercise demonstrates high overall data reliability in mapping and boundary coding, with notable challenges in precise plot relocation, change detection, and certain species identifications/covers.
  - Data users should treat change statistics with caution and rely on QA-informed confidence when interpreting habitat change over time.
  - Ongoing data governance should emphasize robust location tracking, standardized coding, transparent QA metrics, and accessible metadata to support discovery, reuse, and comparative analyses across surveys.
