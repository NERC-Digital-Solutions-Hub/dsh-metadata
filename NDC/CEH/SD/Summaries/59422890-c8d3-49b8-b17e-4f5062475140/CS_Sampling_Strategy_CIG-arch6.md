# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- A historical and methodological overview of how Countryside Survey field sampling has been designed and updated up to 2007, anchored in the ITE (Institute of Terrestrial Ecology) Land Classification. It explains how the sampling framework supports long-term time-series data on habitat and land-use across Great Britain, with later adaptations for England, Scotland, and Wales.

## Core ideas and purpose

- Purpose: To provide a representative, stratified, random sampling framework for GB countryside surveys, enabling national and country-specific estimates of habitats and land-use features over time.
- Foundation: The ITE Land Classification, developed over 30 years, is the folderol for stratifying GB land into discrete classes (strata) to guide sample selection and ensure comparability across surveys.
- Data outputs: Estimates of habitat areas and land-use features are derived by combining class-level statistics (mean habitat area per square) with the total area of each Land Class; outputs support policy, planning, and environmental monitoring.

## Key concepts

- Stratified random sampling: Avoids bias by ensuring all parts of the population (land types) are represented via strata defined by Land Classes.
- Land Classification evolution: From the original 32 Land Classes (1978) to expanded schemes (up to 40 for 1990, then 45 for 2007) to better reflect ecological variation and enable country-specific reporting.
- National estimates method: For each Land Class, multiply the mean habitat area per square by the class’s total GB area; sum across classes for GB, and use country-unit versions for England & Wales or Scotland when needed.

## Timeline of developments and sampling framework

- 1978 CS (Initial Land Classification)
  - 1 km squares classified using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on 1228 center squares; total of about 6039 classified squares around each center.
  - Sampling: 8 sample squares per Land Class; total of 256 squares.
  - Output: Early national estimates of habitat areas by Land Class.
- 1984 CS (Second Field Survey)
  - 12 squares per Land Class (total 384); extended sampling to better capture change signals.
  - Estimation still based on the 1978 Land Classification.
- 1990 CS (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification extended to cover all GB 1 km squares; some squares reclassified.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat data collected for many features from 1984 survey.
  - Output: A silled broader framework; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; CS1990 adjustments)
  - Land Classification updated to improve regional and local estimates; resulted in 40 Land Classes.
  - Recognition that different countries require separate reporting; groundwork for Scotland reporting.
- 2000 CS (CS2000; Fifth Field Survey)
  - Implemented separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) using country-unit versions of Land Classes.
  - Class sub-division and aggregation: 40 strata (later 40+ with country subdivisions); 19 additional squares to ensure representation of new classes; balancing squares across Wales and England.
  - Uplands module (see below) introduced to improve upland habitat estimates.
- 2007 CS (CS2007; Sixth Field Survey)
  - Wales-only reporting intensified due to devolution; added five Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares; England adjustments maintained precision in remaining classes.
  - English classes 5e and 15e left with only 4 squares each, deemed acceptable for reporting per scoping studies.
  - Uplands sampling module remained in use for better precision in upland habitat estimates.

## Country-specific reporting and sampling adjustments

- Separate country estimates introduced to deliver England with Wales and Scotland-specific results.
- Land Classes sub-divided by country units (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w for Wales) and re-aggregated where necessary to maintain adequate representation in each country.
- Wales and England had different sampling intensities in some classes to balance representativeness with precision requirements.

## Data design and outputs

- Sample square counts by survey year and country
  - 1978: 256 samples; 32 Land Classes; 6039 classified squares for GB.
  - 1984: 384 samples; 32 classes; use of 1978 classification for estimates.
  - 1990: 508 samples; all GB squares classified; 40 Land Classes (with urban/sea adjustments).
  - 2000: 569 GB squares (England with Wales focus); introduction of country-unit classifications and uplands module.
  - 2007: 591 GB squares; 45–46 Land Classes (including Welsh subdivisions); Wales-specific class expansions and upland-focused sampling.
- Output types
  - National and country-unit estimates of habitat areas and other ecological features.
  - Maps and tables detailing the distribution and number of sample squares per class and country.
  - Guidance on how to interpret estimates across different classification schemes given devolution and methodological changes.

## Practical considerations and caveats

- Consistency vs. evolution: Changing Land Classification affects cross-survey comparability; a 2006 scoping study recommends using latest classification for GB estimates while retaining older classifications for inter-survey comparability.
- Representativeness: Stratification aims to minimize sampling error and provide robust estimates across GB’s ecological diversity, including uplands and various land-use types.
- Data availability and complexity: The documentation includes detailed tables (e.g., Tables of square counts by class and country) and figures illustrating sample locations and class maps, underscoring the complexity of long-running national ecological monitoring.

## Uplands module and additional sampling

- An extra module for uplands in CS2000 (funded separately) added 30 squares to improve habitat estimates in upland areas, addressing under-sampling in high-elevation terrains.
- This module complemented the main sampling framework to enhance precision in country-specific upland habitat statistics.

## Summary of the approach

- The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007 provides a principled, evolving framework for recording GB countryside ecology through stratified, random sampling guided by the ITE Land Classification.
- It supports long-term, policy-relevant time-series by adapting class schemes and sample allocation to reflect devolution, regional reporting needs, and improved ecological understanding, while balancing consistency and precision across surveys.
