# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose and scope
  - Evaluate consistency and reliability of CS2000 field work across a subset of squares (38 of 519) through a resurvey of one quarter in each square.
  - Assess: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, reliability of percentage cover estimates, direction of habitat change, landcover mapping accuracy, and recording of change.
  - Compare CS2000 QA results with CS1990 QA to gauge improvements and remaining biases.

- Methods and scope
  - Sample: 38 squares previously surveyed in 1998; 234 species plots across nine plot types re-recorded.
  - QA focus areas: location/relocation of plots and plates, species identification, vegetation cover estimates, landcover and boundary coding, and recording of changes since 1990.
  - Plot types include quadrats (200 m and smaller), road verges, streamsides, hedges/boundaries, arable margins, and arable fields (limited sample).
  - Plate relocation: attempted to relocate buried plates eight years later; comparison to 1990 and assessment by QA team.
  - Data comparison: CS2000 survey records (TI) vs QA reassessment (T2) with various concordance and error-type classifications.

- Key findings

  - Plot relocation efficiency
    - Full search relocation success: 86.7% of plots relocated satisfactorily.
    - CS2000 surveyors precisely relocated 60%; ~25% relocated but inexact; ~15% inadequately relocated.
    - Plate recovery: QA assessors located 69.3% of plates; overall rough recovery including approximate relocations estimated around 40–45%.
    - Small “Y-plots” were most difficult to relocate (23% failure).
    - Overall pattern similar to CS1990 QA vs 1990 survey eight years apart, indicating eight-year relocation feasibility but with more challenges in exact plate placement.

  - Species concordance and recording accuracy
    - Approximately 6000 records across 210 plots; 71% of records confirmed as present by QA; 2% non-concordant due to real changes (management/seasonal effects).
    - Initial field recording accuracy around 73%, slightly lower than CS1990’s ~78% (partly due to plot relocation errors).
    - Comparisons of species lists showed QA often produced longer lists; increases over CS2000 similar to prior QA increases over CS1990.
    - Across plots, overall mean species per plot rose from 17.9 (CS2000) to 20.4 (QA); for vegetation-dominant subsets, similar patterns observed.
    - Allocation of TI and T2 variation types indicates most mis-matches stem from overlooked species (about 14–40% depending on plot type), misidentifications, and location/orientation errors.

  - Vegetation cover estimates
    - Visual cover estimates for species >5% showed general concordance; some notable species-level differences observed (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum) often seasonally influenced.
    - For key grasses, cover values were sometimes higher in CS2000 than QA, with several significant differences (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
    - Overall, many common grasses showed good concordance; some variability attributed to season, plot location, and observer interpretation.

  - Change direction and ordination
    - DECORANA ordination (axis 1) showed overall no significant shift in the direction of change between time points when aggregating by plot type.
    - No directional bias detected in mean axis scores between CS2000 and QA; the combined data population remained stable.

  - Landcover and boundary mapping
    - Primary landcover codes: high concordance between CS2000 and QA; overall primary landcover agreement around 87.5% (excluding BAP codes). When including BAP codes, concordance remained strong but varied by code.
    - Landcover categories (BAP codes) showed somewhat lower agreement (e.g., BAP codes around 77.4%).
    - Boundary and landuse coding: strong concordance for primary boundary features (about 92% code concordance; total concordance about 85%), with some mis-matches often due to outdated or changed boundaries (e.g., hedges, fences).
    - Hedge/stockproof boundaries and wall conditions: moderate to good concordance (boundary-related codes around 67.5% for hedge attributes; omissions contributed to errors). Stockproof vs. non-stockproof judgments showed little systemic bias between surveyors and assessors.
    - Change in landuse codes: concordance in documenting changes was relatively low (overall change concurrence about 51.4%), with many changes either not noted by CS2000 or not substantiated by assessors. A substantial portion of observed changes since 1990 may have been missed.

  - Arable plots
    - Very limited sample (five arable plots); concordance was poor (about 30.6%), attributed to seasonality and less familiarity with ruderal species. Recommendation: plan multiple visits for arable margins in future work.

  - Changes in frequency of prevalent species
    - Frequency patterns between CS2000 and QA broadly preserved for major species, though some species showed over- or under-recording tendencies.
    - Mosses generally under-recorded; some Poa and perennial grasses frequently mis-recorded or misidentified.
    - Overall ranking of common species largely consistent; however, recording of certain grasses and herbaceous species varied with plot type and observer.

  - Land-use sample points and cover qualifiers
    - Species cover at land-use sample points showed reasonable concordance (overall around 63%), with some species (e.g., Lolium perenne, Cynosurus cristatus) showing notable agreement gaps, often tied to identification ease and seasonal changes.
    - Cover codes for shared species (e.g., Lolium perenne) generally showed good agreement (around 74–89% depending on grouping); some species exhibited systematic overestimation or underestimation.

- Overall interpretation for environment-monitoring analysts
  - The CS2000 QA exercise demonstrates generally high reliability in field data collection and mapping, with robust concordance for many landcover and boundary codes.
  - Major sources of discrepancy relate to plot relocation/orientation, 8-year relocation challenges, and observer-related species identification and cover estimation differences.
  - Change detection between 1990 and 2000 shows substantial gaps in consistently recording changes, highlighting the need for rigorous change-coding protocols and perhaps better change-validation processes.
  - Mapping components (primary landcover) show strong performance, while BAP and some boundary- or hedge-related codes are more variable, suggesting targeted training or clearer coding guidelines could improve consistency.
  - Arable margins remain problematic with small sample sizes; additional visits and training could improve reliability in these habitats.
  - For policy performance and environmental health monitoring, CS2000 QA supports the value of standardized, repeatable procedures and provides explicit diagnostics to enhance data quality, provenance, and comparability over time.

- Implications for data access and value
  - The QA highlights the importance of enabling access to underlying data and metadata to support external validation and reuse.
  - It shows where datasets can be combined with other data sources to increase value and reduce single-use limitations, aligning with broader monitoring goals.
