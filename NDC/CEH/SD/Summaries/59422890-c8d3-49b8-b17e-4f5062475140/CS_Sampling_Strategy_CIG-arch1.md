# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Introduction
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Links the current framework to three decades of development of the ITE Land Classification (started 1978).
- Emphasises that the methodology is intertwined with its predecessors and understanding past approaches is essential.

## The ITE Land Classification: concept and origin
- Uses stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage across Britain.
- Early approach classified at 1 km square level using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) rather than species.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to group quadrats and scale up to land classes.
- Initial output comprised 32 land classes describing environmental variation across GB.
- The sampling framework used a center-square approach (1228 center squares, plus surrounding squares) to produce a total classified set and to estimate the area of each class.

## The beginning: CS1978 sampling framework
- 32 land classes formed from classified squares; the sampling unit was 1 km squares.
- 8 samples per class were drawn at random, yielding a total of 256 field squares.
- National habitat estimates derived as: mean habitat area per square in a class × total area of that class.
- This foundational framework established how later surveys would be compared and interpreted.

## The second survey: CS1984
- Expanded the sample: 12 squares surveyed per land class (total 384).
- Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- Early insights into landscape changes later published in Landscape Changes in Britain.

## Application to CS1990 and all-squares Land Classification
- CS1990 introduced an all-squares approach: extended classification to every GB square using key climatic, geological and physiographic surrogates.
- Final field survey for CS1990 included 508 squares.
- A Land Cover Map of GB was linked to this programme.
- Some squares changed class during reclassification; overall, only about 62% correspondence with the earlier 1978 classification, though most “moved” into neighboring classes, keeping average class characteristics.
- The shift sought to improve regional and local estimations but introduced representational distortions for some classes.

## Developments in CS2000: new classification and country estimates
- Need to provide separate country estimates (England & Wales; Scotland) prompted major changes.
- The ITE Land Classification was extended into country-unit versions; classes were subdivided and aggregated to create 40 strata (from 32).
- Additional squares were added to ensure adequate representation of new/altered classes; minimums established (e.g., at least 6 squares per new class in each country unit where feasible).
- A Scoping Study recommended reporting country-based estimates, not just GB-wide estimates.
- Some country-specific refinements included: Wales-focused adjustments, Isle of Man replacement with new England squares, and an uplands module for more precise upland habitat estimates.
- Output: documentation of class distributions and sample allocations, with a focus on England & Wales and Scotland separately.

## Uplands module: improving upland habitat estimates
- CS2000 added an uplands module funded to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- This module placed 30 squares in upland/ marginal upland areas to boost precision where previous sampling was underrepresented.

## Welsh-only reporting and CS2007 preparations
- Devolution created demand for Wales-only environmental reporting.
- CS2000 Welsh sampling (64 Wales squares) was deemed inadequate for Wales-only estimates for 2007.
- CS2007 introduced:
  - Country-unit sub-divisions: five new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Expanded Wales sampling to 43 additional squares to guarantee at least 6 squares in each Welsh class.
  - England adjustments: in some English classes (5e, 15e) only 4 squares were available; scoping study suggested precision loss would be small enough for reporting purposes.
- England, Wales, and Scotland each had revised Land Class maps reflecting these country-specific frameworks.

## The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey 2007
- Provides updated class maps and sample square distributions enabling Wales-only reporting and better cross-country comparability.
- Table 3 summarises the numbers of squares surveyed per land class for CS2007, across England, Wales, Scotland, and GB totals.
- Notable trends:
  - Wales saw substantial increases in sample squares and class subdivisions to support Wales-specific estimates.
  - England maintained most classes but with some classes dropping to a minimum sampling level due to Welsh adjustments.
  - Scotland’s sampling and class structure adjusted to support Scottish reporting, with dedicated country-specific estimates.

## Note on national estimates and comparability
- A key caveat: changing the classification framework affects cross-survey comparability of national estimates.
- For consistency within an individual survey, the latest country-specific classification is preferred; for cross-survey comparability, older classifications may be used.
- Table 4 provides the number of squares per class under the original (1990) Land Classification for historical comparability.

## Appendix: brief history of the ITE Land Classification
- 1978: Initial Land Classification with 32 classes; 8 samples per class (256 total).
- 1984: Second field survey; 12 squares per class (384 total); used 1978 classification for national estimates.
- 1990: All-Squares Land Classification; 508 squares; introduction of Land Cover Map; urban/sea corrections.
- 1998: Revised Land Classification; separate Scottish reporting; increased to 40 classes.
- 2007: Further revisions; separate Welsh reporting; increased to 45 classes.
