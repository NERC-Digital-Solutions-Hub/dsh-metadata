# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Aim and purpose
  - Establish a consistent, time-series framework for monitoring the GB environment.
  - Use standardized data collection and land classification to enable policy evaluation and environmental health assessments over time.
  - Produce outputs (habitat estimates, maps, reports) that support scrutiny of environmental change and policy performance.

- Core concepts and approach
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage and reduce bias.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to define land classes serving as the stratification framework.
  - Transition from field-survey-only segments to broader, country-specific reporting while maintaining national comparability.

- The ITE Land Classification: origins and evolution
  - Began in the early 1970s with Bunce and Shaw, evolving from local vegetation classification to national land stratification using environmental attributes.
  - 1 km square sampling unit chosen for national survey feasibility; initial classification created from a subset of squares due to limited computing power.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used historically to group quadrats and upscale to landscape-scale land classes.
  - Progressive updates:
    - 1978: 32 land classes developed; 1 km squares classified; core sampling framework established.
    - 1984: Framework extended to 12 squares per class; focus broadened to land use and habitat mapping.
    - 1990: All GB squares classified; Land Cover Map linked; 508 squares surveyed; original 32 classes expanded to accommodate all GB squares.
    - 2000: Further refinements to enable Scotland- and England/Wales-specific reporting; number of land classes expanded to 40; distribution changes to ensure country-specific estimates.
    - 2007: Welsh-only reporting requirements driven adjustments; land classes subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata expanded to 45.

- Sampling framework across Countryside Survey cycles
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
    - 8 squares per Land Class; 256 total squares.
    - Field data focused on vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
  - CS1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - 12 squares per Land Class; ~384 total squares.
  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
    - All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Expanded data collection to include repeat quadrats and broader features; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - CS2000 (Revised Land Classification & Fourth Field Survey)
    - Separate country estimates introduced (England & Wales; Scotland); 40 strata (expanded to 45 with country-unit subdivisions).
    - Additional 19 squares added to ensure representation of new classes; upland habitat sampling expanded (30 additional upland squares) for better country-specific accuracy.
  - CS2007 (Revised Land Classification & Fifth Field Survey)
    - Wales-specific reporting further refined; five Welsh sub-classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Wales received substantial additional sampling (107 Welsh squares total) to improve Wales-only estimates; England adjustments followed to maintain balance.
    - Wales upland-focused sampling emphasized to strengthen country-specific habitat estimates.

- Country-specific reporting and uplands module
  - Separate country estimates established to support England & Wales together and Scotland reporting, with adjustments to sampling design to reflect country boundaries and policy needs.
  - Upland and marginal upland habitats added as a dedicated module in CS2000 to improve statistical precision for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Implications for data quality, outputs, and policy relevance
  - Time-series consistency achieved by building on previous Land Classifications while updating to reflect policy-relevant reporting units (Scotland, England & Wales, Wales).
  - Outputs include mapped land classes, stratified sample data, and habitat estimates, enabling tracking of environmental change and policy impacts across decades.
  - National estimates have been discussed in the context of using the latest Land Classification for consistency, while historical comparability is preserved through reference to original classifications where appropriate.

- Data handling and note on national estimates
  - The document discusses methods for deriving national estimates (mean habitat area per square times land-class area) and the implications of changing classifications on cross-survey consistency.
  - Acknowledges trade-offs between using the latest classification for current reporting and maintaining cross-survey comparability.
