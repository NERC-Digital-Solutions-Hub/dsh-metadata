# About the survey

- Context and purpose: Part of the Fragments, Functions and Flows in Urban Ecosystem Services (F3UES) project, designed to characterize variation in breeding bird fauna across urban forms in the Bedford, Luton, and Milton Keynes area. The 2014 survey also recorded the numbers of people observed during each observation.
- Study area and sampling design: Data collected May–June 2014 in three UK towns. Each town defined by a 500m × 500m grid; 116 tiles were randomly selected for surveying using stratified sampling. Within each tile, four survey points (≥200m apart and ≥100m from tile edges) were identified to represent the range of urban greenspace. Some points were inaccessible and not surveyed.
- Data collection approach: Point count method with two visits per tile (06:00–10:00) to measure morning abundances. Ten-minute counts at all survey points per visit, recording birds seen/heard within distance bands (0–20m, 20–40m, 40–60m, 60–100m, 100–200m) and in flight, plus a best-estimate when totals differed from sum of counts. Birds were categorized as singing or non-singing; observers also recorded a best estimate if counts were inaccurate.
- People counting: Observers recorded the number of people within 200m of the survey point, by activity type (e.g., children, dog walking, working, etc.).
- Environmental conditions: Start time of each 10-minute count, then weather variables including wind (Beaufort), rain, cloud cover, visibility, and noise. Surveys were not conducted in heavy rain or high winds.
- Data consolidation and validation: Multiple data entryters digitized field sheets. The dataset was compiled, error-checked, and validated.
- Data structure and contents: The dataset (F3UES_birdpoints2014.zip) comprises two dataframes connected by a unique point-count identifier (pcid):
  - Bird observations dataframe: Contains per-10-minute observation details (pcid; species codes; species names; approach/bestest; counts across multiple minute intervals and distance bands for singing/non-singing birds, including in flight). Distance-band and time-window variables are grouped (e.g., m12_*, m34_*, m56_*, m78_*, m910_* across 20m/40m/60m/100m/200m and in-flight).
  - Survey details dataframe: Contains per-10-minute observation context (pcid; city; observer; tile; visit; point; month; time of day; date/time; weather and environmental variables; counts of people by activity type).
- Supporting spatial metadata: Tile locations are provided in F3UES_birdsurvey_tile_locations.csv, with tile id, city, and OSGB1936 easting/northing coordinates for the 500m × 500m tiles.
- Species glossary: Table 4 provides a comprehensive mapping of BTO two-letter codes to full species names (e.g., BT = Blue Tit, GK = not listed here; see glossary for full list).
- Data linkage and accessibility: Use pcid to merge the two dataframes. Missing data are marked as NA. The dataset includes note on tiles not surveyed due to inaccessibility.
- Practical use and potential analyses for data support: Suitable for creating dashboards or reports to explore urban bird patterns, compare across cities/tiles, and examine relationships between bird counts and urban form or human activity. The structured, self-serve-ready format supports data scoping, cleaning, and transformation by data support professionals aiming to enable others to explore and derive insights from the data.
