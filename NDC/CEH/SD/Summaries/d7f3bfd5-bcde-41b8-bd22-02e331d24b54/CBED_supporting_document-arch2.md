# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- Purpose: Generate 5x5 km resolution maps of wet and dry deposition for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, and base cations, using measured air concentrations and precipitation ion concentrations; outputs support assessment of environmental health and critical loads in the UK.
- Data sources: Measurements from the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network; observations interpolated to UK-wide concentration maps.
- Wet deposition: Calculated from precipitation ion concentrations combined with annual precipitation; includes direct cloud droplet deposition (occult deposition) and an orographic enhancement factor for upland regions.
- Dry deposition: Derived from gas/PM concentration maps and habitat-specific deposition velocities; computed for five land cover categories (forest, moorland, grassland, arable, urban); deposition to non-woodland vs woodland habitats varies by category to support critical load calculations.
- Key components and data sources:
  - Sulphur dioxide (SO2) concentration map derived from rural measurements with urban enhancement.
  - Oxidised nitrogen deposition: nitric acid concentrations from interpolation; NO2 concentrations from the PCM model (rural, point sources, line sources).
  - Ammonia concentrations from the FRAME model and UKEAP measurements (local variability).
- Temporal framework:
  - Calculations are annual, but results are provided as rolling 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability in weather, emissions, and transport.
  - Outputs are ecosystem-specific and provided in two scenarios (moorland/short vegetation everywhere; forest everywhere) plus grid-average values.
- Outputs and delivery:
  - 3-year mean deposition data with ecosystem-specific assumptions across 5x5 km grid squares; includes grid-average as well as forest and moorland scenarios.
  - Exceedance assessments for critical loads derived from these deposition values.
- Data structure ( examples of fields ):
  - Spatial identifiers: easting and northing (centre of 5x5 km grid square in OS Great Britain grid).
  - Forest-specific deposition values: nox_f (oxidised nitrogen), nhx_f (reduced nitrogen), nms_f (non-marine sulphur), nm_ca_mg_f (non-marine base cations: Ca+Mg).
  - Moorland-specific deposition values: nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m, nm_ca_mg_m.
  - Grid-average deposition values: nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga.
  - All deposition values expressed as keq ha^-1 year^-1 (with guidance to convert to kg ha^-1 year^-1 via specific multipliers).
- Data conversion and units:
  - To convert keq ha^-1 year^-1 to kg S ha^-1 year^-1: multiply by 16 (for sulphur) or to kg N ha^-1 year^-1: multiply by 14 (for nitrogen species).
  - Base cation deposition (Ca+Mg) uses calcium equivalents: multiply by 20 to obtain kg Ca ha^-1 year^-1.
- Quality control and governance:
  - Methods align with government QA for analytical models; extensive peer review and participation in model inter-comparison exercises.
  - Version control, documentation of method developments, central storage of code, and mass-balance checks to ensure numerical consistency.
  - Results widely published in peer-reviewed literature; led by established senior responsible officers.
- Supporting information and references:
  - Detailed methodology, model descriptions, and validation studies referenced (e.g., Dore et al., Fowler et al., Stedman et al., RoTAP, etc.).
