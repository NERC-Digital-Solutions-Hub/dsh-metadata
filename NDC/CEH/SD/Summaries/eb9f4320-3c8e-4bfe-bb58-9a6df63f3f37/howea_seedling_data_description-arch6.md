# Experimental location and source site

- Seeds were collected from six sites across Lord Howe Island:
  - Howea forsteriana (Hf): Bowker Avenue (Ba), Far Flats (Ff), Grey Face (Gc), Middle Beach (Mb), Plantation (P)
  - Howea belmoreana (Hb): Far Flats (Ff) and Golf Course (Gc)
- Soils: calcareous (C) from Ned's Beach and volcanic (V) from Salmon Beach
- Experimental location: Lord Howe Island Nursery (latitude -31.525, longitude 159.067)

## Experimental design

- For each seed set (combination of species and source site), 1000 seeds were planted.
- Growth containers: boxes 60 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm filled to 15 cm with soil, lined with sealable bags.
- Soil conditions: four combinations of soil type and sterilisation
  - calcareous sterilised
  - calcareous unsterilised
  - volcanic sterilised
  - volcanic unsterilised
- For each seed set and soil condition: five boxes, 50 seeds per box
- Planting setup: boxes placed in a random outdoor order under shade
- Planting date: September 2015

## Seedling transplant and drought treatment

- November 2016: all germinated seedlings were potted into individual 12 cm x 6 cm x 6 cm pots using the same soil type (unsterilised)
- Pots placed outside under shade and watered every three days
- March 2018: randomly selected half of the plants from each condition (by species, seed site, soil condition) underwent drought treatment
  - Drought: watering ceased for two weeks
  - Non-drought: normal watering
  - Plants were grouped into drought and non-drought boxes of 40 plants each, arranged in a checkerboard formation

## Phenotyping

- Survival assessments at three time points:
  - November 2016 (14 months)
  - March 2018 (30 months, before drought treatment)
  - May 2018 (32 months, after drought treatment)
- Measurements:
  - Plant height and leaf number at 14 months and 32 months
  - Height measured as distance from ground to base of the tallest leaf (accuracy 5 mm)
  - Leaves counted, including leaf scars from abscised leaves
  - Death criterion: plant considered dead if the growing shoot was completely desiccated

## Key codes and categories

- Seed sites abbreviated: Ba (Bowker Avenue), Ff (Far flats), Gc (Golf course), Gf (Grey face), Mb (Middle beach), P (Plantation)
- Soil types: C (Calcareous), V (Volcanic)
- Species: Hf (Howea forsteriana), Hb (Howea belmoreana)
- Data units: Plant height (cm)

## Additional data fields (table explanations)

- Box_code: Arbitrary box identifier
- Seedling code: Arbitrary seedling identifier for those surviving to November 2016
- alive_Nov2016/Mar2018/May2018: Whether the seedling was alive at each time point (TRUE = alive, FALSE = dead)
- height_Nov2016/May2018: Height in cm at November 2016 and May 2018
- N_leaves_Nov2016/May2018: Number of leaves in November 2016 and May 2018
- drought_treatment: N = non-drought, D = drought
- soil_sterilisation: N = no, Y = yes
