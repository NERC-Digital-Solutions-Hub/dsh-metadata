# Pot_Number Unique identifier for each individual mesocosm

## Overview
- Dataset describes a fully-factorial mesocosm experiment examining the presence of biochar and its interactions with crop type and soil texture.
- Aims align with environmental monitoring: standardised data to assess environmental health and policy-relevant outcomes over time.
- Focuses on biological, chemical, and physical soil and plant measurements to evaluate ecosystem responses.

## Experimental Design and Treatments
- Biochar treatment: Presence of 2% biochar (w/w) in soil; values indicated as presence (+) or absence (-).
- Crop_type: Barley seeded at 1.8 t ha-1, Ryegrass seeded at 2.0 t ha-1, or Unvegetated (no crop).
- Soil_texture: SC (sandy clay), SZL (sandy silt loam), or CL (clay loam).
- Year: Year of sampling.
- Block: Spatial block within the enclosure; ensures replication of each treatment combination across four blocks in the fully-factorial design.
- Sampling framework: Data captured for multiple mesocosms across blocks and years to enable temporal and spatial comparisons.

## Measured Variables
- Biotic densities (per gram dry soil, top 10 cm): Density_Nematoda, Density_Microarthropod, Density_Collembola, Density_Acari.
- Plant biomass: Aboveground_Biomass (grams per mesocosm, destructively harvested annually), Belowground_Biomass (grams per g-1 soil).
- Microbial community indicators: Total_PLFA (nmol g-1 soil), Bacterial_PLFA (specific fatty acids per g-1 soil), Fungal_PLFA (specific fatty acids per g-1 soil), AM_Fungal_PLFA (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi PLFA per g-1 soil).
- Soil carbon and nitrogen: soil_C (% C) and soil_N (% N) measured via flash combustion (105 °C, 24 h) on a 30 mg subsample.
- Non-pyrogenic soil carbon: non_py_soil_c, adjusted C to account for biochar-derived carbon using an established equation (Ct minus portion attributed to biochar).
- Soil moisture: Soil moisture calculated from weight difference before/after oven drying.
- pH: Soil pH measured from 1 g soil with 2 mL deionised water after shaking.
- Sampling note: '.' indicates no sample taken for that entry.

## Data Collection and Processing
- Subsampling and analysis: Standardised sub-sampling and analytical approaches (e.g., sample preparation, flash combustion, PLFA profiling) to ensure comparability.
- Destructive harvest: Aboveground biomass collected annually via destructive harvesting.
- Data quality: Emphasis on verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation prior to analysis and dissemination.
- Outputs: Results presented in accessible formats (reports, maps, charts) to support interpretation and policy-relevant insights.
- Data storage: Datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for accessibility and re-use.

## Data Management and Access
- Standardised methodologies to maintain consistency across measurements and time.
- Clear documentation of measurement methods and units to facilitate cross-study comparisons.
- Commitment to enabling access to underlying data used to generate outputs, supporting transparency and reproducibility.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Challenge: Increase the value of monitoring datasets by integrating them with other relevant data sources to avoid single-use limitations.
- Challenge: Improve accessibility of underlying data so others can reuse it for broader analyses and policy evaluation.
- Opportunity: Use standardized, well-documented datasets to assess environmental health and policy performance over time, enabling robust comparisons and meta-analyses.
