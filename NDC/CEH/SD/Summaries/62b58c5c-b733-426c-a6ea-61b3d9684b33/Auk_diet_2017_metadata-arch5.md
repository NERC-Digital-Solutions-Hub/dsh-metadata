# The dataset:

- Contains prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2017 breeding season at East Caithness SPA, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May NNR off the east coast of Scotland.
- Diet studies for these species have a long history at the Isle of May; standard methods have been in place since 1987 as part of seabird monitoring.

## Scope and purpose

- Provides standard, repeatable methods and protocols for assessing diet to inform seabird monitoring and research.
- Aims to quantify prey delivered to chicks (and, for guillemot, displays to adults) using observed prey in bills.

## Methods and field measurements

- Diet quantified by visual observation of prey carried in bills by breeding adults returning to the colony.
- Fieldwork conducted by trained staff following defined protocols; data captured in notebooks and field data sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets and backed up on CEH servers.
- Notebooks and field sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- For common guillemot:
  - Two-hour watches 04:00–22:00 at each site during specific windows (various dates in June–July 2017).
  - Observations recorded: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; opportunistic observations recorded lengthier variables.
  - Prey primarily include lesser sandeel and clupeids; clupeids lump sprat/herring due to field identification limits.
  - Prey size classified into five categories; some prey observed during chick provisioning may not be fully classifiable.
  - Number of prey recorded as exact or broad categories.
- For razorbill:
  - Similar two-hour watches with additional data: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number; opportunistic observations recorded with limited variables.
  - Diet similarly dominated by lesser sandeel and clupeids; clupeids treated as a single group.
  - Prey size classified into five categories; some identifications may be incomplete due to observational constraints.
  - Number of prey recorded as exact or broad categories.

## Data handling and databases

- Data collected in field notebooks and sheets are transcribed to spreadsheets; data are backed up on CEH servers.
- All databases used are quality controlled at source.

## Data quality, governance, and outputs

- Output integrity, report quality, relation to contracted deliverables, and timeliness are vetted and tracked within CEH by senior staff.
- CEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information with customer approval and acknowledgment.
- Methods are standardized and have remained consistent since 1987, ensuring comparability over time.

## Data limitations and notes

- Clupeids (sprat and herring) are difficult to separate in the field; all clupeids are recorded as such.
- Some prey items observed during display or feeding may be obscured, limiting precise species/size classification.
- Fish sizes are estimated from ledges when possible; very few gadoids were collected for precise sizing.
- Prey counts may be exact estimates or broader categories (few, many) due to the challenge of counting items in the bill.

## Site and temporal coverage

- East Caithness SPA (58°12´42'N, 03°27´53'W), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA (57°23´07'N, 01°52´09'W), Isle of May NNR (56°10´57'N, 02°33´17'W).
- Observation windows and dates span June–July 2017, with dawn-to-dusk watches on the Isle of May and extended observation periods at other sites.

## Use and linkage to longer-term programs

- Diet assessment methods consistent with long-term seabird monitoring initiatives (e.g., Isle of May Long-Term Study; JNCC Seabird Monitoring Programme).
- Data intended to support ongoing assessments of prey communities and seabird foraging ecology, with standardization enabling comparability across years and sites.
