# The dataset:

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides standard, repeatable methods and protocols to assess the diet of two seabird species (common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda).
  - Based on long-running monitoring (since 1987) as part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study and UK Seabird Monitoring Programme.
  - Data collected during the 2017 breeding season at three sites off the east coast of Scotland: East Caithness SPA, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May NNR.
  - Diet information complements historical studies at Isle of May and provides new data for Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast and East Caithness.

- Field setting and study sites
  - East Caithness SPA (58°12´42'N, 03°27´53'W)
  - Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA (57°23´07'N, 01°52´09'W)
  - Isle of May NNR (56°10´57'N, 02°33´17'W)
  - Methods include standardized observation periods and opportunistic observations across the same general dates as the 2017 season.

- Species-specific sampling and observations
  - Common guillemot (Uria aalge)
    - During chick-rearing, adults return with a single prey item to feed the chick and may display prey to other adults.
    - Observation watches: two hours (04:00–22:00) on specified dates; additional opportunistic observations.
    - Data collected: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; for opportunistic observations, only prey size and arrival were recorded.
  - Razorbill (Alca torda)
    - During chick-rearing, adults return with multiple prey items to feed the chick and provide observation data accordingly.
    - Observation watches: similar two-hour blocks and opportunistic dates as guillemot.
    - Data collected: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number; opportunistic observations record time of arrival (or not specified) and the last two fields (prey size and number).

- Data collection protocol and timing
  - Observations conducted at plots with active breeding sites; documented across 04:00–22:00 (guillmot) or dawn-to-dusk (razorbill) with site-specific dates.
  - Additional opportunistic observations conducted within the same date ranges.
  - Data sheets and field notebooks used; information transcribed to spreadsheets and archived on CEH servers.

- Data fields and coding
  - Prey items and prey size categories
    - Five size classes: very small, small, medium, large, very large.
    - Size classification guided by adult bill length; some prey may be obscured during feeding.
    - For fish, most prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring); in-field identification of sprat vs. herring is not possible, so all are coded as clupeids.
    - Very few gadoids observed; sizes estimated from fish found on breeding ledges; overall gadoid contribution is minor.
  - Species-specific notes
    - Clupeids (sprat and herring) are grouped together due to field identification limitations.
  - Quantity recording
    - Number of prey recorded either as an exact estimate or as a broad category (e.g., few, many).
  - Data handling nuances
    - When a prey item is presented to a chick, it is presumed eaten even if species/size cannot be confirmed at that moment.
    - In guillemot data, some prey items presented may be obscured and not all could be classified by size/species.

- Data provenance and quality
  - Data originate from field observations by trained staff using defined protocols.
  - Field data transcribed to spreadsheets; notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases used are quality controlled at source.
  - Output and reporting are vetted through CEH management and aligned with contracted deliverables.
  - Publication of non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature is encouraged with customer approval.

- Outputs and potential data products
  - Diet composition by species, site, and year.
  - Size-class distribution of prey delivered to chicks.
  - Differences in prey number per observation (single-item for guillemot vs multiple items for razorbill).
  - Data suitable for dashboards or self-serve exploration to understand temporal and spatial variation in diet.

- Context and references
  - Diet quantification methods have been consistent since standardisation in 1987 (cited works by Harris & Wanless and others).
  - Prior related studies at Isle of May and at Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast provide context for interpreting observed prey communities and the impact of prey availability on seabird provisioning.
  - Key references include works from Harris & Wanless (1985, 1986), Wilson et al. (2004), Daunt et al. (2008), Thaxter et al. (2013), and Anderson et al. (2014).
