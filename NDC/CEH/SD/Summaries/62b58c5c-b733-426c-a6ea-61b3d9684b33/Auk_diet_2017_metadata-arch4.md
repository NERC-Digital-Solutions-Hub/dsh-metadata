# The dataset:

- Scope and context
  - Dataset of prey items for common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2017 breeding season.
  - Sites: East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May National Nature Reserve, off the east coast of Scotland.
  - Part of long-running seabird diet studies linked to the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) and UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) seabird monitoring programme.

- Background and standards
  - Diet assessment methods have been standardized since 1987; linked to established protocols in related literature.
  - Purpose: provide standard, repeatable methods and protocols for assessing diet of the two species.

- Data collection and field measurements
  - Core approach: observe prey carried in bills of breeding adults returning to colony to feed chicks (or display in guillemots).
  - Observation regimes:
    - Common guillemot: two-hour watches (04:00–22:00) on specified dates at each site; additional opportunistic observations.
    - Razorbill: two-hour watches with similar timing; dawn-to-dusk observations on Isle of May with additional opportunistic observations.
  - Recorded variables during watches: time of arrival, prey species, prey size. Opportunistic observations recorded prey size and number only.
  - Prey size categorization: five classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) based on adult bill length.
  - Species identification: majority of prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring); sprat/herring difficult to separate in the field; all clupeids treated as a single category in the dataset.
  - Special notes: when feeding chicks, prey may be obscured; taxa or size for some items may be uncertain; fish on breeding ledges used to estimate fish lengths in size categories.
  - For razorbill, prey number is recorded in addition to species and size; for guillemot, prey number is not always determinable.

- Data quality, handling, and storage
  - Field data collected by trained staff using notebooks and field data sheets; transcribed to spreadsheets; regular backups on CEH servers.
  - All notebooks and field sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases quality controlled at the data source; output vetted through CEH management structures (Heads of Science Areas, Directors, Finance Administration).
  - Data sharing and publication: staff encouraged to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgement.

- Output characteristics and limitations
  - Consistent data collection across years enables long-term trend analyses.
  - Key limitation: difficulty distinguishing sprat from herring; most clupeids grouped together as clupeids.
  - Some prey size and species identifications rely on indirect cues (e.g., feeding displays) and may be uncertain.
  - Prey counts can be exact estimates or broader categories (few, many), reflecting measurement challenges in the field.
