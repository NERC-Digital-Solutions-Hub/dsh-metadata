# The dataset

## Purpose and context
- Documents the prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2017 breeding season in East Caithness SPA, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May NNR off the east coast of Scotland.
- Part of a long-running seabird diet study at the Isle of May, with standardized methods since 1987 within the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee’s Seabird Monitoring Programme.
- Aims to provide standard, repeatable methods and protocols for assessing the diet of the two species to support environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Field measurements and methods
- Diet assessment relies on observing prey carried in the bills of breeding adults returning to the colony to feed chicks (and display in guillemot).
- Fieldwork conducted by trained staff following defined protocols; data collected in notebooks/field sheets and transcribed to spreadsheets; back-ups stored on CEH servers; notebooks/sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- For guillemot:
  - Two-hour watches from 04:00–22:00 at specified plots during defined date ranges; additional opportunistic observations.
  - Recorded: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; opportunistic observations recorded for prey size/number.
  - Most prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat or herring; many cannot be separated in the field).
  - Prey size classified into five categories using adult bill length as a guide; some prey may be consumed before identification is possible.
  - Fish on breeding ledges used to estimate lengths within size categories.
  - Gadoids are few; overall gadoid sizes not accurately assessed due to small numbers.
  - Prey numbers recorded as exact estimates or broad categories (few, many) due to difficulty estimating in-bill prey counts.
- For razorbill:
  - Similar two-hour watches with same time windows and locations; opportunistic observations as above.
  - Recorded: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number; opportunistic observations recorded for size/number.
  - Diet predominantly includes lesser sandeel and clupeids; identification challenges similar to guillemots.
  - Prey size classified into five categories; occasional inability to identify exact species when feeding to chicks.
  - Fish on breeding ledges used to estimate lengths within size categories.
- Both species employ standard remote observation methods to infer diet from provisioning behavior and display events.

## Data management and quality
- Databases are quality controlled at the data source.
- Field data are systematically transcribed, backed up, and archived; data handling adheres to defined protocols.

## Output and governance
- Results and reports subject to management vetting and tracking within CEH by senior science and administrative leadership.
- Aims to align with contracted deliverables and timely reporting.
- CEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential results in peer-reviewed literature, with customer approval and acknowledgement.

## Diet assessment specifics by species
- Common guillemot Uria aalge
  - Methods standardized since 1987; data allow quantification of diet from a single prey item brought to the chick or used in display.
  - Watches conducted at specified colonies with defined dates; data include arrival time, prey species, and prey size; opportunistic observations capture size/number.
  - Prey composition dominated by lesser sandeel and clupeids; clupeids include sprat and herring (often indistinguishable in the field).
  - Prey sized into five classes; size estimation sometimes hindered by chick feeding posture.
  - Fish on ledges used to estimate lengths within size categories; limited ability to size gadoids due to small numbers.
  - Prey counts may be exact or categorized as few/many due to counting challenges.
- Razorbill Alca torda
  - Similar standardized methods since 1987; data collected from chick provisioning when adults feed the chick.
  - Watches replicated as for guillemot, with recording of arrival time, prey species, size, and number; opportunistic observations capture size/number.
  - Diet also largely composed of lesser sandeel and clupeids; clupeids treated as a single category in the dataset.
  - Prey size classified into five categories; occasional uncertainty in species identification during feeding.
  - Fish on ledges used to estimate lengths within size categories; gadoids underrepresented in the diet data.
  - Prey counts recorded as exact estimates or broad categories when precise counting is difficult.

## Data classification and observations
- Five prey size classes: very small, small, medium, large, very large.
- Prey numbers: recorded exactly when possible or as broad categories (e.g., few, many) due to estimation difficulty.

## Data limitations and notes
- Clupeids treated collectively (sprat and herring) due to identification challenges in the field.
- Some prey identification and size estimation are not possible in all observations (particularly when the prey is eaten or obscured).
- Very few gadoids observed limit accurate sizing analysis for that group.
