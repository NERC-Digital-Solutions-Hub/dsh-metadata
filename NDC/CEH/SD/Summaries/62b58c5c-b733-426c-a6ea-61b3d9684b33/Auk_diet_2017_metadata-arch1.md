# The dataset:

## Aim and scope
- Observes prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda during the 2017 breeding season.
- Study sites: East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR) off the east coast of Scotland.
- Diet of these species has a long history of study; this work builds on decades of monitoring and standardised methods.

## Background and standardisation
- Diet quantification methods have been consistent since seabird monitoring was standardised in 1987.
- The Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) and JNCC Seabird Monitoring Programme provide the long-term context.
- The manual offers standard, repeatable protocols for assessing the diet of both species.

## Field measurements and data handling
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced staff following defined protocols; data recorded in notebooks and field data sheets.
- Data transcribed to spreadsheets after checks; backups stored on CEH servers.
- Notebooks and field sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Databases are quality controlled at source; outputs are vetted within CEH management framework.

## Sites, timing, and observation protocols
- Two-hour watches (04:00–22:00) conducted at active breeding plots:
  - East Caithness SPA (58°12′42″N, 03°27′53″W): 13 June–1 July 2017
  - Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA (57°23′07″N, 01°52′09″W): 19 June–5 July 2017
  - Isle of May NNR (56°10′57″N, 02°33′17″W): 21 June and 25 June 2017
- Additional opportunistic observations on similar date ranges.
- For guillemot, observations also include displays to other adults; data collection focuses on prey carried in bills when returning to feed chicks or for display.
- For razorbill, observations include multiple fish per bill when feeding chicks.

## Data variables and measurement details

### Common guillemot Uria aalge
- Data collected during watches: time of arrival, prey species, prey size.
- Opportunistic observations: time of arrival not recorded; prey size and species recorded.
- Prey size classified into five categories: very small, small, medium, large, very large; size estimates guided by adult bill length.
- Prey identified in the field: majority are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring grouped as clupeids when species-level separation is not possible).
- When feeding a prey item to the chick, classification may be uncertain if the item is obscured during display.
- Fish found on breeding ledges used to estimate lengths within size categories.
- Some prey items cannot be identified by size or species; presumed eaten if presented to the chick.
- Gadids are a very small part of the diet; too few collected to size accurately.

### Razorbill Alca torda
- Data collected during watches: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number.
- Opportunistic observations: time of arrival not recorded; prey size and number recorded.
- Prey size classification and identification practices mirror the guillemot approach.
- Clupeids (sprat and herring) are treated as a single category when field separation is not possible.
- When feeding fish to the chick, similar observational limitations can apply.
- Fish on ledges used to estimate lengths within size classes; gadids again constitute a very small portion of diet.

## Data quality control, storage, and dissemination
- Data quality controlled at source; all data and outputs tracked through CEH management structures.
- CEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.
- Data and datasets are maintained to be discoverable, with metadata when uploaded to data portals.

## Output and use
- The dataset documents standard methods for quantifying seabird diet, enabling consistent interpretation across sites and years.
- Observations support understanding of prey composition, prey size distribution, and temporal feeding patterns during chick-rearing.
- Findings align with historical literature and prior studies at Isle of May and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast; East Caithness SPA represents a newer data point for diet assessment.
