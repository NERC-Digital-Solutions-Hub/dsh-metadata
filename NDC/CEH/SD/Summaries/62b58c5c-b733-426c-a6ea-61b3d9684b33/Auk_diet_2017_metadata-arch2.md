# The dataset:

- Dataset of prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2017 breeding season at East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR) off the east coast of Scotland.
- Part of a long-running seabird diet monitoring program; methods have been standardised since 1987 as part of Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) and the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee’s Seabird Monitoring Programme.
- Purpose: provide standard, repeatable methods to assess diet and support environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation over time.

## Monitoring context and standardisation

- Diet assessment methods are consistent with historical seabird monitoring standards (since 1987).
- Diet data support understanding of prey communities and potential impacts of fisheries and productivity on seabird foraging.

## Data collection and handling

- Fieldwork conducted by experienced staff using defined protocols; data recorded in notebooks and field sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets; backups stored on CEH servers; notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Databases quality controlled at source; outputs monitored for integrity, reporting timeliness, and alignment with customer requirements.
- CEH staff encouraged to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.

## Common guillemot diet assessment (Uria aalge)

- Observational method: during chick provisioning, adults return with a single prey item in the bill (also used for display in some cases); data collected from visual observations from a fixed position.
- Field schedule:
  - East Caithness: two-hour watches 04:00–22:00, 13/6–1/7/2017.
  - Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast: two-hour watches 04:00–22:00, 19/6–5/7/2017.
  - Isle of May: dawn-to-dusk watches on 21/6/2017 and 25/6/2017.
  - Opportunistic observations on the same date ranges as above (Isle of May: 2/4–16/7/2017).
- Recorded data: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; opportunistic observations recorded for arrival time only in some cases.
- Prey composition: predominantly lesser sandeel and clupeids (sprat and herring); clupeids are grouped together in the dataset because field separation is often not possible.
- Size classification: prey assigned to five size classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) using adult bill length as a guide; some prey obscured during feeding displays; estimated fish sizes from ledges when available.
- Notes on data: too few gadoids (a subset of clupeids) available to accurately size; gadoids contribute only a small portion of diet.
- Prey counts: reported either as exact estimates or as broad categories (few, many) due to difficulty of precise bill observations.

## Razorbill diet assessment (Alca torda)

- Observational method: similar to guillemot—during chick provisioning, adults return with multiple fish in the bill to feed the chick.
- Field schedule:
  - East Caithness: two-hour watches 04:00–22:00, 16/6–1/7/2017.
  - Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast: two-hour watches 04:00–22:00, 20/6–5/7/2017.
  - Isle of May: dawn-to-dusk watches on 21/6/2017 and 25/6/2017.
  - Opportunistic observations on the same date ranges as above (Isle of May: 3/6–14/7/2017).
- Recorded data: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number; opportunistic observations recorded for size and number.
- Prey composition: predominantly lesser sandeel and clupeids; clupeids grouped together when species cannot be distinguished.
- Size classification: same five-class scheme as guillemot; size estimates derived from bill observations and ledge findings when possible; display behavior can obscure prey.
- Notes on data: as with guillemot, gadoids are a very small portion of the diet; some prey items cannot be identified to species; numbers may be reported as estimates.

## Data outputs, quality control, and dissemination

- Data integrity and report quality are subject to management vetting and tracking within CEH (Heads of Science Areas, Directors, Finance Administration).
- Outputs are aligned with contracted deliverables and reporting timelines.
- Data are intended to support long-term monitoring and enable synthesis with other datasets.

## Patterns and context for environmental monitoring

- Across both species, most observed prey are lesser sandeel and clupeids, reflecting known regional prey use during breeding.
- Standardised methods enable temporal comparisons to assess changes in prey communities and potential impacts of fisheries management and environmental change.

## Data accessibility and reuse

- Data handling practices enable sharing of underlying data with appropriate approvals; researchers are encouraged to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed outlets with customer acknowledgment.
