# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Wellbeing in Mozambican Woodlands (ACES) – Household Survey Methods

- The ACES project (June 2013 – March 2018) aimed to investigate links between woodland cover, ecosystem service availability, and wellbeing in three Mozambique regions, using a quantitative household survey to test the hypothesis of abrupt wellbeing changes as ecosystem services change with woodland loss. The survey followed a classical HAI+ format and collected data on household composition, assets, income, and special sections on education, health, housing, service access, ecosystem service use, land and agriculture, shocks, and subjective wellbeing. The design reflects Mozambique’s multidimensional view of poverty and wellbeing.

## Study location and village selection
- Data were collected in three districts representing distinct social-ecological contexts:
  - Marrupa District, Niassa Province: low infrastructure; subsistence agriculture.
  - Gurué District, Zambezia Province: major commercial crop production (soya, pulses, sunflower) from smallholders.
  - Mabalane District, Gaza Province: high dependence on charcoal production for Maputo.
- 27 villages were included: 7 in Mabalane, 10 in Gurué, 10 in Marrupa.
- A space-for-time approach was used, selecting villages with varying intensities of the dominant land use (charcoal in Mabalane, soya in Gurué, tobacco in Marrupa) while aligning soils/vegetation and ensuring village leadership presence.

## Household sampling strategy
- Household definition: people “eating from the same pot.”
- Sampling approaches differed by district:
  - Mabalane: attempted census of all households (small villages).
  - Marrupa and Gurué: stratified random sampling with oversampling of rich and very poor households (seen as key for ecosystem service dependence).
- Sampling goals aimed to capture inter-household variation and, where possible, intra-household dynamics (e.g., education data at the individual level).

## Household list generation and initial validation
- Household lists were compiled via village secretaries. Details included household head and polygamy status.
- Polygamous households were treated as separate if each wife ate from a different pot; otherwise, wives sharing a pot belonged to the same household.
- Lists were typed in Excel and validated by enumerators at survey start. Households not found or unknown in wealth rankings were removed from the sampling frame.

## Wealth strata and wealth ranking
- A participatory wealth ranking created four strata per village: rich (rico), medium (estavel), poor (pobre), very poor (muito pobre). An additional ‘unranked’ stratum existed for households unknown to ranking participants or not on the list.
- In Marrupa and Gurué, intra-strata ranking order was recorded (best-off ranked highest); duplicates indicated ties.
- Post-sampling checks (Sept–Nov 2016) compared survey names to household lists; mismatches were corrected when possible; otherwise, households with unresolved IDs remained unranked or had missing wealth data.

## Household sampling (detailed)
- Mabalane: attempted complete sampling of listed households (roughly 84% of village households; treated as an incomplete census).
- Marrupa and Gurué: stratified sampling with varying probabilities by wealth stratum:
  - Target: 100% sampling for rich and very poor; up to 50% for other strata.
  - In larger villages with many poor households, up to 80% sampling of the very poor.
- Random sampling achieved via Excel random numbers (selecting households with a random number ≤ the desired intensity).

## Household survey design
- Internal desk review informed the ACES Household Survey:
  - CIFOR-PEN prototype questionnaire (assets, income, land, shocks).
  - ASSETS (education, health, housing, firewood, food security, coping strategies).
  - Missing Dimensions of Poverty (subjective wellbeing).
  - Mozambican National Agricultural Survey (food security).
  - Reality Checks (baseline coding).
- Questions targeted inter-household variation and, where possible, intra-household variation (e.g., education at the individual level).
- Income data covered nine sources (environmental and non-environmental) to capture 12-month income, using a mix of irregular and regular income questions. Expenditure data were not systematically collected due to attribution difficulties and subsistence-based economies.
- District-specific adjustments were made (e.g., the relevance of soya questions in Gurué) and iterative changes were implemented based on learnings (see Supporting Document 2).

## Data collection
- Data collection windows:
  - Mabalane: May–October 2014 (reference year 2013–2014).
  - Marrupa: May–August 2015 (reference year 2014–2015).
  - Gurué: August–December 2015 (reference year 2014–2015).
- Method: tablets with Open Data Kit (ODK) and locally trained enumerators; interviews conducted in the local language with data entered in Portuguese.
- Local language data collection and unit conversions followed district-specific practices; metric conversions were based on Mozambican National Agricultural Survey tables and focus group inputs.
- The tablet-based approach enabled real-time preliminary analyses and reduced post-collection data entry.

## Data cleaning and quality assurance
- Daily consistency checks during the field season before database submission.
- Post-season data cleaning included cross-checks for recording consistency, removal of duplicates, spelling standardization, and handling missing values.
- The a_household data table was cleaned rigorously for analyses in published work; other tables may require pre-processing before new analyses, as they may not be uniformly cleaned.

## Ethical considerations
- Ethics approvals and requirements from the ESPA programme and the University of Edinburgh were followed.
- Participants provided written informed consent for participation and dissemination.
- An anonymization protocol was designed to protect individual privacy in write-ups and dissemination (details available from the lead dataset author).
