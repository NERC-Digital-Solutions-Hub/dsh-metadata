# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 4 : Units Focus Groups Protocol

- Rationale
  - Understand the local units used for crops and forest products (e.g., maize, beans, soya, cowpeas, grass, poles).
  - Obtain both raw and transformed unit measures, record and photograph results to guide household surveys.

- Time
  - Approximately 2 hours.

- How to do it
  - 1. Convene a small focus group of up to four people, preferably including a local merchant.
  - 2. Invite the village leader or local merchant to bring the different units they use to harvest, store, and sell main crops (maize, soya, beans) and forest products.
  - 3. Have local participants pack the units with the respective crop according to their standards, noting how packing (e.g., sack size) can affect measurements.
  - 4. Weigh the units.
  - 5. Record results in the Excel sheet "Conversion Units TIA, Niassa, Gurue, Agriculture."
  - 6. Record results in the village folder and in two documents:
     - a) Excel: "Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date" (two tabs: raw crop and transformed crop; ensure the correct tab is used).
     - b) Word: "Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date."
     - c) Record metadata in each document.
     - d) Take pictures and save them in the "Pictures" folder; title descriptively (e.g., "Balde de 14 KG de milho sem transformacao (raw maize)"); record descriptions in the Word document: "Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date."
     - e) Print pictures and hand out to students for household interviews.
  - 7. Use the folder "Template for reference_Mocube_Niassa_04_06_2015" as guidance.
  
- Where and When
  - In each village of Gurue; identify and involve a local merchant if possible.

- Materials
  - Scales
  - Rope
  - Scissors
  - Tablet for taking pictures
  - Pens/markers
  - Index cards

- Data management and backup
  - Save data on an external hard drive and in Sango.

- Procedure and data scope
  - Strive for accuracy and completeness; record units for different crops in both raw and transformed forms, and for different purposes (harvesting, storing, selling).
  - If raw maize is recorded in one village, attempt to record transformed maize in another village if feasible.
  - Ensure coverage of the main regional crops: maize, soya, beans.

- Payment
  - Use the same payment approach as for other qualitative exercises.
