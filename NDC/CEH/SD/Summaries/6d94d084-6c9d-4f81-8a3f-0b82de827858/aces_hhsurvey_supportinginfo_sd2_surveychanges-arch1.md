# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 2 : ACES Household Survey Changes - Mabalane to Marrupa and Marrupa to Gurué

## Overview
- The document lists survey instrument changes implemented across two transition periods: Mabalane (May–Oct 2014) to Marrupa (May–Aug 2015) and Marrupa (Aug–Dec 2015) to Gurué (Aug–Dec 2015).
- Purpose: to refine data collection for analyzing abrupt changes in ecosystem services and household well-being, and to capture richer income, asset, and activity data.

## Changes from Mabalane to Marrupa (2014 → 2015)
- Income section
  - Enumerators received more pre-coded multiple-choice answers to streamline recording.
  - The order of income questions was changed (e.g., from sequence: quantity sold, price per unit, unit to: quantity sold, unit, price per unit).
- New topics added
  - Inputs used for tobacco production for both commercial and subsistence use (including woodfuel type).
  - Charcoal produced in the past 12 months now includes price per unit.
  - Derived income areas added: derived forest income, fishing, and environmental income.
  - A new module: asked for the month in which the activity occurred in the last year (seasonality aspect).

## Changes from Marrupa to Gurué (2015)
- Land and services
  - Added questions on land conflicts and access to services, including both a 12-month window and a 5-year timeline.
  - Added question to specify with whom the land conflict occurred.
- Additional income items and coding
  - Bamboo added as a pre-coded answer in direct_forest_income_type.
  - New income code for selling along the street in the village (local market, street, to friends/family, direct to consumers/producers/organizations).
  - Brick-making added as an income code.
- Wage labour
  - Added questions for employer name and type of employment.
- Crop and input details
  - New answer codes added to crops section (e.g., corn with merchant maize) and for renting out equipment (e.g., tractors).
  - Added questions on inputs for soya production (commercial and subsistence).
  - Inputs in crop production disaggregated by crop (organic fertilizer, pesticides, inoculated seeds, improved seeds).
  - Specific pest types added to the general pest question, plus a quantity of crops lost due to pests.
- Protein source
  - Added questions about the household’s main source of protein.

## Implications for Analysis
- Cross-round comparability
  - Introduction of new variables and re-coding requires careful harmonization to enable trend analyses across rounds.
  - New income types and assets necessitate mapping to prior categories or separately modeling new variables.
- Data richness and granularity
  - Seasonality captured via month-of-activity questions enhances temporal analysis of forest-based and other income.
  - Disaggregation of crop inputs and pest losses offers finer diagnostics for ecological and agricultural shocks.
- Survey design considerations
  - More pre-coded responses may affect response patterns; changes in question order could influence reporting.
  - Expanded modules (land conflicts, protein sources, etc.) increase survey depth but may affect respondent length and burden.

## Data Management and Quality Considerations
- Metadata updates are required to document variable additions, new codes, and re-ordered questions.
- Guidance needed for researchers to align datasets across rounds, including code mappings for new and revised variables.
- Training and documentation should reflect new modules (land conflicts, months-based activity, new income types) to ensure consistent interpretation.
