# Abrupt   Changes   in   Ecosystem   Services   and   Well-Being   in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household   Survey   Data   Supplementary Document 4 :   Units Focus Groups Protocol

## Purpose and Rationale
- Understand local units used for crops and forest products (e.g., maize, soya, beans, grass, poles).
- Capture both raw and transformed unit forms.
- Record results in data files and photographs to guide household surveys.

## Data Collected
- Units for main crops and forest products, including raw and transformed forms.
- Unit types used for harvesting, storing, and selling.
- Weights/volumes of units when packed by participants.
- Descriptive metadata for each unit (e.g., purpose, form).

## Data Collection Procedure
- Form groups of up to four participants; involve a local merchant if possible.
- Have village leader or merchant bring relevant unit containers (sacks, baskets, buckets, etc.).
- Participants pack units according to local standards; weigh each unit.
- Record results in Excel file: 'Conversion Units TIA, Niassa, Gurue, Agriculture'.
- Maintain organization in village-specific folders and in two documents:
  - Excel: 'Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date' (two tabs: raw vs transformed).
  - Word: Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date (with metadata).
- Take photographs; save in 'Pictures' with descriptive titles; include descriptions in the Word document.
- Print pictures for use by enumerators during household interviews.
- Refer to the guidance folder 'Template for reference_Mocube_Niassa_04_06_2015'.

## Data Organization and Naming Conventions
- File naming:
  - Excel: Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date (two tabs: raw and transformed).
  - Word: Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date.
- Photos saved with descriptive titles (e.g., "Balde de 14 KG de milho sem transformacao (raw maize)").
- Record metadata in each document; keep a clear folder structure per village.

## Metadata and Provenance
- Capture metadata within each Word document (date, location, participants, units, purpose).
- Ensure metadata aligns with two-tab Excel sheet (raw vs transformed) for traceability.

## Data Backup, Storage, and Access
- Back up data to an external hard drive and to Sango (local storage). 
- Maintain accessible backups to safeguard against data loss.

## Data Quality, Standards, and Consistency
- Strive for accuracy and exhaustiveness across villages and crops.
- Ensure units exist for both raw and transformed forms and across different purposes (harvesting, storing, selling).
- Use weights/measurements consistently to enable cross-site comparability.

## Tools, Formats, and Documentation
- Tools: scales, rope, scissors, tablet for photos, pens/markers.
- Formats: Excel workbook (two tabs), Word document for metadata, image files.
- Documentation: record metadata in each document; provide descriptive photo titles and descriptions.

## Risks, Ethics, and Compliance
- Coordinate with local actors (village leaders, merchants) to facilitate data collection.
- Ensure transparent recording and guidance for enumerators; plan for potential variability in local units.
- Payment was part of qualitative activities; consider ethical and fair participant treatment in fieldwork.

## How This Supports Data Stewardship
- Establishes standardized unit data across multiple villages for key crops and forest products.
- Facilitates discoverability and reuse by providing clear data structure, metadata, and documentation.
- Enables timely, accurate data collection and sharing through organized artifacts and backups.
