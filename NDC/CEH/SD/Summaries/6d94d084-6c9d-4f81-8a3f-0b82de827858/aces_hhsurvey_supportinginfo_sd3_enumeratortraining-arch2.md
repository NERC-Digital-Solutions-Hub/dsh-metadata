# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 3 : Enumerator Training Notes

## Purpose and context
- Provides training guidance for enumerators conducting the household survey part of the ACES project, aimed at understanding abrupt changes in ecosystem services and well-being.
- Demonstrates how the survey speaks to the main hypothesis and how paper-based and electronic formats are structured.
- Introduces sampling rationale and how many households to target, plus who to interview and why.
- Emphasizes Q&A to ensure clarity and consistency across enumerators.

## Training structure and schedule
- Day-by-day plan across five days:
  - Day 1 and Day 2: Work through the household survey up to the income module; break sessions; group exercises to practice the early sections.
  - Day 3 and Day 4: Continue from income onward with repeated practice and discussions.
  - Day 5: Practice completing the entire survey; continue discussions and Q&A.
- Each day includes group exercises (pairs) to conduct sections of the survey and subsequent results discussion.

## Important points to cover for enumerators
- Ethics Form: handling informed consent and ethical considerations.
- Use of GPS: recording precise location data.
- Small weighting scale: appropriate application during data collection.
- Abacus: tool for calculations during fieldwork.
- Notebook for enumerators: maintaining field notes and observations.
- Phone to do calculations: using mobile devices for arithmetic as needed.

## Survey design and data collection approach
- Structure: both paper and electronic survey formats are introduced; tablets were used only in training in Marrupa District (Niassa) to familiarize students with the survey layout.
- Sampling strategy: outline of target households and interviewees, including rationale for selection to ensure representative environmental and well-being data.
- Data handling: emphasis on data quality, standardised methods, and later storage/upload to appropriate portals (consistent with monitoring objectives).

## Income module: 12-month timeframe and data sequencing
- Timeframe: income refers to the last 12 months; if a reference event (e.g., harvest) occurred within the 12-month window, it is counted; events outside are not.
- Example framing:
  - Interview date example: 01.06.2015.
  - The last harvest must be between 01.06.2015 and 01.06.2014 to be within 12 months; a harvest on 01.03.2015 is within, whereas 01.03.2014 is outside.
  - If a harvest occurs after the interview date (e.g., 01.07.2015), it is recorded as 0 for that harvest within the last 12 months, with notes where appropriate.
- Correct sequence to record:
  1) How much did you earn (harvest) in the last 12 months?
  2) How much of that amount have you used up until now?
  3) How much of that amount have you sold up until now?
- Important distinction to avoid incorrect sequencing:
  - Do not ask for gross income, gross consumption, and gross sales from the last 12 months in isolation, as these may refer to older harvests or savings rather than the 12-month window.

## Practical exercises and learning outcomes
- Group pairing exercises to simulate conducting the survey up to income, then from income onward, and eventually the full survey.
- Regular discussions and Q&A to reinforce correct administration, data capture, and sequencing.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring
- Trains enumerators to collect standardized, high-quality data on ecosystem services and household well-being, enabling longitudinal monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Emphasizes reproducible methods, clear data definitions (especially for income and harvest-related questions), and robust data handling to support environmental health assessments over time.
