# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 4 : Units Focus Groups Protocol

- Rationale
  - Understand the local units used for different crops (maize, beans, soya, cowpeas) and forest products.
  - Capture both raw and transformed units, with results recorded and photographed.
  - Print photographs to be used as guidance for household surveys by enumerators.

- Time
  - 2 hours.

- How to do it
  - 1. Convene a small group of up to four people; include the local merchant if possible.
  - 2. Ask the village leader or local merchant to bring the units they use to harvest, store, and sell main crops (maize, soya, beans) and forest products.
  - 3. Have local participants pack the units with the respective crop according to their standards, noting that packaging can affect measurements.
  - 4. Weigh the units.
  - 5. Record results in the Excel sheet "Conversion Units TIA, Niassa, Gurue, Agriculture".
  - 6. Record results in the village folder and in two documents:
    - a. Excel: "Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date" (two tabs: raw crop and transformed crop; ensure data is placed in the correct tab).
    - b. Word document: "Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date".
    - c. Record metadata in each document.
    - d. Take pictures and save them in the folder "Pictures" with descriptive titles (e.g., "Balde de 14 KG de milho sem transformacao (raw maize)") and describe in the Word document: "Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date".
    - e. Print pictures and hand out to students for household interviews.
  - Note: Use the folder "Template for reference_Mocube_Niassa_04_06_2015" as guidance.

- Where and When
  - In each village of Gurue; identify a local merchant to assist if possible.

- Materials
  - Scales, rope, scissors, tablet for taking pictures, pens/markers, index cards.

- Data backup
  - Save data on an external hard drive and in Sango.

- Procedure
  - Strive for accuracy and exhaustiveness; obtain units forCrops in both raw and transformed forms and for different purposes (harvesting, storing, selling).
  - If raw maize is recorded in one village, attempt to obtain transformed maize units in another village when possible.
  - Aim to cover the main regional crops: maize, soya, and beans.

- Payment
  - Use the same payment as with other qualitative exercises.
