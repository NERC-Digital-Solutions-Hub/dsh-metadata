# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1)
## Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 4 : Units Focus Groups Protocol

- Objective
  - Understand the units local people use for crops and forest products (maize, soya, beans, cowpeas, grass, poles, etc.) in raw and transformed forms.
  - Produce measured units, record results, and photograph units to guide household surveys.

- Time and Setting
  - Time: approximately 2 hours.
  - Setting: villages in Gurue, Mozambique; involve local leader or merchant to facilitate.

- Data Collection Approach
  - Form a small focus group of up to four participants (preferably including a local merchant).
  - Request the local merchant to bring different units used for harvesting, storing, and selling main crops.
  - Have participants pack units according to their standards; weigh each unit.
  - Record results in Excel: “Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date” (with two tabs: raw crop and transformed crop).
  - Create a Word document: Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date; record metadata in each document.
  - Save photographs in a “Pictures” folder with descriptive titles; document descriptions in the Word file.
  - Print pictures for distribution to students conducting household interviews.

- Data Recording and Metadata
  - Ensure correct handling of the two Excel tabs (raw vs transformed).
  - Include metadata in each document.
  - Use the reference template folder: “Template for reference_Mocube_Niassa_04_06_2015”.

- Procedure (Step-by-Step)
  - 1) Convene a small group (up to four) with possible involvement of a local merchant.
  - 2) Ask the village leader/local merchant to bring various units for main crops and forest products.
  - 3) Instruct locals to pack units according to their standards (note: packing can influence volume measurements).
  - 4) Weigh the units.
  - 5) Record results in the Excel sheet (raw and transformed forms).
  - 6) Save results in village folder and in two documents (Excel and Word), with proper metadata and photo references.
  - 7) Take photos and save with descriptive titles; document descriptions in the Word file.
  - 8) Print pictures and share with students for household interviews.

- Where and When
  - In each Gurue village; engage a local merchant if possible to assist.

- Materials
  - Scales, rope, scissors, tablet for photos, pens/markers, index cards.

- Data Backup
  - Save data on an external hard drive and in Sango (local language).

- Practical Notes
  - Aim for accuracy and exhaustiveness across crops (raw and transformed) and purposes (harvesting, storing, selling).
  - If raw maize is recorded in one village, attempt to collect transformed maize data in another, ensuring coverage of main regional crops (maize, soya, beans).

- Payment
  - Use the same payment approach as with other qualitative exercises.
