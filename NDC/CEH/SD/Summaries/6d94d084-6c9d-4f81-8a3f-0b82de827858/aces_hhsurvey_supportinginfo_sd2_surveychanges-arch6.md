# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 2 : ACES Household Survey Changes - Mabalane to Marrupa and Marrupa to Gurué

- Overview
  - Documents changes to the ACES Household Survey across survey rounds: Mabalane (May–October 2014), Marrupa (May–August 2015), and Gurué (August–December 2015).
  - Focuses on how question wording, order, and answer options were altered to capture additional detail and new topics.

- Key changes by survey transition
  - Mabalane to Marrupa (2014 → 2015)
    - Income section expanded with more pre-coded multiple-choice answers to ease data recording.
    - Income question order modified (from quantity sold, price per unit, and unit to quantity sold, unit, price per unit).
    - Added questions on inputs used for tobacco production (including type of woodfuel).
    - In “Charcoal produced past 12 month,” price per unit introduced.
    - Added derived income modules for forest income, fishing, and environmental income, including a question on the month each activity occurred in the last year.
  - Marrupa to Gurué (2015)
    - Added questions on land conflicts and access to services, with a 5-year timeline and a prompt to specify with whom the land conflict occurred.
    - Bamboo added as a pre-coded answer in direct_forest_income_type.
    - New answer code in income section for primary/secondary selling places (e.g., selling along the street in village/market or to friends/family/consumers).
    - Brick-making added as an income answer code.
    - Wage labour section expanded to collect employer name and type of employment.
    - New answer codes added to crops (e.g., corn merchant maize) and renting out equipment (tractors).
    - Added questions on inputs used for soya production (commercial and subsistence).
    - Inputs in crop production disaggregated by crop (organic fertilizer, pesticides, inoculated seeds, improved seeds).
    - Added questions about the specific pest type and the quantity of crops lost due to pests.
    - Added questions on households’ main source of protein.

- Implications for data analysis and reuse
  - Cross-round comparability: substantial changes in questions, order, and answer codes may hinder direct comparisons without harmonization or a crosswalk.
  - Enhanced data richness: new variables enable more granular analyses of income sources, inputs, and pest impacts, but require careful documentation and mapping across rounds.
  - Temporal framing: inclusion of “months in the last year” for activities and a 5-year timeline for conflicts introduces differences in time windows that must be aligned during analysis.
  - Coding consistency: new pre-coded options and codes require updated data dictionaries and careful handling to maintain backward compatibility.

- Data management and documentation recommendations
  - Create a detailed data dictionary and crosswalk mapping variables and codes across rounds.
  - Maintain round-specific metadata and note where questions were added, reordered, or recoded.
  - When building integrated datasets, derive harmonized variables (e.g., standardized income categories, comparable time-frame indicators) and keep original round variables for traceability.
  - Provide guidance for researchers on handling newly added topics (land conflicts, access to services, new income types) in comparative analyses.

- Potential data products and analyses
  - Comparative dashboards by round showing changes in income composition, forest and environmental incomes, and new activities (tobacco inputs, brick-making, bamboo usage).
  - Spatial and temporal analyses of land conflicts and access to services with the 5-year timeline.
  - Seasonal analyses leveraging the months-attribution data for different activities and incomes.
  - Baseline-to-follow-up analyses examining the impact of newly captured inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, improved seeds) on crop outcomes.

- Limitations and caveats
  - Some additions are only present in later rounds, affecting longitudinal analyses.
  - Changes in question order and response options may require imputation or re-coding for consistent cross-round comparisons.
  - Expanded timeframes (12 months vs 5-year) necessitate careful alignment to avoid misinterpretation of trends.
