# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 2 : ACES Household Survey Changes - Mabalane to Marrupa and Marrupa to Gurué

## Purpose and Scope
- Documents changes to the ACES household survey instrument across survey rounds (Mabalane 2014, Marrupa 2015, Gurué 2015).
- Aims to preserve data compatibility and trace how instrument changes affect measurements of ecosystem services and well-being over time.

## Summary of Changes

- Mabalane to Marrupa (2014–2015)
  - More pre-coded responses in the income section.
  - Reordered income questions (quantity sold, price per unit, unit).
  - Added questions on inputs used for woodfuel production.
  - Charcoal: added price per unit.
  - Added questions for derived forest income, fishing, and environmental income; included month of activity in the last year.

- Marrupa to Gurué (2015)
  - Added questions on land conflicts and access to services, with both 12-month and 5-year timelines and detail on who the conflict involved.
  - Bamboo added as a pre-coded answer in direct_forest_income_type.
  - New answer codes in income section for primary/secondary selling places (e.g., selling along village streets) and added brick-making as an income activity.
  - Wage labour: added employer name and type of employment.
  - New income/crop codes: corn (merchant), renting out equipment (e.g., tractors).
  - Added questions on inputs for soya production (commercial and subsistence).
  - Inputs in crop production disaggregated by crop (organic fertilizer, pesticides, inoculated/improved seeds).
  - Added detail on pests: specific pest types and quantity of crops lost.
  - Added question on households’ main source of protein.  

## Implications for Analysis and Data Management

- Enhances ability to link environmental services with livelihoods and resource use (woodfuel, charcoal, forest income, fishing) and with exposure to land conflicts and service access.
- Longitudinal comparability improved through standardized, pre-coded responses, but requires careful cross-walks between old and new codes.
- Metadata, QA processes, and data processing pipelines must be updated to reflect new variables and coding schemes.
- Data storage and portal submissions should align with revised instrument structure and variable definitions.

## Recommendations for Analysts

- Develop and maintain a cross-round mapping of codes and indicators; document in metadata.
- Update data processing pipelines to incorporate new variables and disaggregate inputs by crop where applicable.
- Train field teams on revised modules to maintain consistency and data quality.
- Plan for handling missing data arising from instrument changes and ensure robust longitudinal indicators.
