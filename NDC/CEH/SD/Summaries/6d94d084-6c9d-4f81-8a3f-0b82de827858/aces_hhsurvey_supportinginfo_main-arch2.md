# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Wellbeing in Mozambican Woodlands (ACES): Household Survey Methods

- Objective and scope
  - Assess links between woodland cover, ecosystem service availability, and wellbeing in three Mozambican districts (Marrupa, Gurué, Mabalane).
  - Quantitatively evaluate household socio-economic wellbeing and use/dependence on ecosystem services.
  - Follow a classical HAI+ format to test the hypothesis of abrupt wellbeing changes as ecosystem services shift with woodland loss.
  - Special survey sections cover education, health, housing, service access, ecosystem service use, land/agriculture, shock coping, and subjective wellbeing; income data captured across nine sources; emphasizes multidimensional poverty concepts.

- Study location and village selection
  - Three districts chosen to represent distinct social-ecological contexts:
    - Marrupa (Niassa): subsistence livelihoods, low infrastructure.
    - Gurué (Zambezia): major commercial crop region (soya, pulses, sunflower) from smallholders.
    - Mabalane (Gaza): livelihoods heavily dependent on charcoal production for Maputo.
  - 27 villages total (7 Malabane, 10 Gurué, 10 Marrupa) selected using a space-for-time approach, reflecting different intensities of the dominant land-use driver (charcoal, soya, tobacco) with comparable soils/veg types and village leadership.

- Household sampling strategy
  - Definition: a household = people eating from the same pot.
  - Sampling modes by district:
    - Malabane: attempted census (small villages).
    - Marrupa and Gurué: stratified random sampling with oversampling of rich and very poor households, based on literature linking these strata to ecosystem service reliance.
  - Aims to capture variation across wealth groups while maintaining representativeness.

- Household list generation and initial validation
  - Household lists compiled by village secretaries; polygamous distinctions treated as separate households if each wife eats from a separate pot.
  - Lists entered in Excel and validated by enumerators at survey start; discrepancies clarified (headedness, polygamy).
  - Non-found or unknown households removed from the sampling frame.

- Wealth strata and wealth ranking
  - Participatory wealth ranking within each village yielded four strata: rich (rico), medium (estavel), poor (pobre), very poor (muito pobre); an 'unranked' category for unknown or not-yet-listed households.
  - In Marrupa and Gurué, recording also included ranking order within strata; duplicates and unranked cases tracked.
  - Post-sampling verification (Sept–Nov 2016): cross-checked survey names against household lists and wealth rankings; corrected mismatches; households with unresolved identities not carrying wealth data.

- Household sampling (detailed)
  - Mabalane: attempted to sample all listed households; final sample ~84% of village households (incomplete census).
  - Gurué and Marrupa: stratified sampling with varying probabilities by wealth stratum; high intensities for rich and very poor, lower for middle strata; approximately 80–100% sampling in very rich/very poor in many villages.
  - Random sampling implemented via Excel random numbers; households selected if random number ≤ target intensity per stratum and village.
  - Tables (Tables 1–2) document discretized sampling intensities by village and wealth category.

- Household survey design
  - Desk reviews of established instruments (CIFOR-PEN, ASSETS, Missing Dimensions of Poverty, Mozambique National Agricultural Survey) to inform questions.
  - Designed to elicit inter-household variation (within-village) and intra-household variation (individual members, e.g., education).
  - Income data: comprehensive, spanning nine income sources (environmental and non-environmental); structured to cover last 12 months with a mix of regular and irregular income questions; expenditure not systematically collected due to attribution challenges and subsistence economies.
  - District-specific adaptations: e.g., additional questions on soya in Gurué; adjustments over rounds to reflect observed land-use drivers.
  - Final metadata and complete question sets are documented in Supporting Documents.

- Data collection
  - Field periods correspond to reference years: 2013–2014 (Mabalane), 2014–2015 (Marrupa and Gurué).
  - Mode: tablet-based interviews using Open Data Kit (ODK) to enable real-time data capture and immediate quality feedback.
  - Enumerators: 30 local enumerators trained; interviews conducted in local languages with responses recorded in Portuguese; local language fluency prioritized.
  - Units: local units retained for agricultural products; conversions to metric units applied using national survey conversion tables and focus group input.
  - Data flow: digital collection reduces post-field data entry, enabling faster integration with other ACES components.

- Data cleaning and quality assurance
  - Daily consistency checks during field season; subsequent post-season consistency reviews.
  - Procedures include deduplication, spell-checking, standardizing text, and handling missing values.
  - Analyses-ready data primarily rely on the a_household dataset; some non-published tables may require pre-processing by new analysts.
  - Documentation notes ongoing data management considerations and the need for data pre-processing for new analyses.

- Ethical considerations
  - Compliance with ESPA program and University of Edinburgh ethics requirements.
  - Written informed consent obtained from all participants.
  - Anonymization protocol to preserve respondent confidentiality in dissemination and publications.
  - Contact the lead dataset author for details on the anonymization protocol.

- Data and outputs for environmental monitoring analysts
  - Provides a multi-dimensional, time-referenced dataset linking household well-being to ecosystem service use and woodland changes.
  - Enables standardised outputs (income sources, asset ownership, service access, education/health metrics) suitable for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Data collection and quality assurance practices align with established livelihoods and environmental-dependence methodologies, supporting integration with broader monitoring portals and data-sharing initiatives.
  - Clear documentation of sampling design, wealth stratification, and district-specific adaptations facilitates replication and comparative analyses across similar environmental monitoring contexts.
