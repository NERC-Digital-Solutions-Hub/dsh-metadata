# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 2 : ACES Household Survey Changes - Mabalane to Marrupa and Marrupa to Gurué

## Overview
- Documents the survey changes implemented between consecutive rounds (2014 Mabalane, 2015 Marrupa, 2015 Gurué) to improve data collection, breadth of livelihood and environmental income data, and the ability to monitor changes over time.
- Aims to facilitate easier data recording, richer variables for monitoring ecosystem services and well-being, and better alignment with policy-relevant indicators.

## Changes between Mabalane (2014) and Marrupa (2015)
- Income section: enumerators received more pre-coded multiple-choice answers to simplify data recording.
- Income questionnaire: order changed (from “quantity sold, price per unit, unit” to “quantity sold, unit, price per unit”) to improve flow and consistency.
- New inputs: added questions on inputs used for tobacco production (including types of woodfuel) to capture production costs and inputs.
- Charcoal income: introduced price per unit as a recorded variable for past 12 months.
- New derived income questions: added for derived forest income, fishing, and environmental income, including a question on the month in which activities occurred in the last year.

## Changes between Marrupa (2015) and Gurué (Aug–Dec 2015)
- Land and services: added questions on land conflicts and access to services, with both a 12-month and a 5-year timeline, plus details on with whom the land conflict occurred.
- New income coding: bamboo added as a pre-coded answer in direct_forest_income_type.
- Selling location: expanded answer codes for primary and secondary selling places (e.g., selling along the street in village, local market, etc.).
- New activity: brick-making added as an income option.
- Wage labour: added questions for name of employer and type of employment.
- Crop and equipment: new income codes introduced (e.g., corn by merchant, renting out equipment like tractors).
- Soya production: added questions on inputs used for commercial and subsistence production.
- Inputs by crop: disaggregated inputs for crop production (organic fertilizer, pesticides, inoculated seeds, improved seeds) by crop.
- Pest losses: added questions specifying pest types and a quantity of crops lost due to pests.
- Nutrition data: added question on households’ main source of protein.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- Improves temporal and contextual granularity (monthly activity timing, 5-year conflict timeline) and captures a broader set of livelihoods and forest/environmental income sources.
- Enhances specificity for policy-relevant monitoring (land access, service delivery, risk from pests, seasonality of activities).
- Increases data richness and potential for richer indicators, but adds complexity requiring robust metadata, careful data governance, and clear documentation to maintain cross-round comparability.
- Necessitates updated data management standards, training, and metadata to ensure data quality, transform processes, and transparency in how new variables are derived and linked.
