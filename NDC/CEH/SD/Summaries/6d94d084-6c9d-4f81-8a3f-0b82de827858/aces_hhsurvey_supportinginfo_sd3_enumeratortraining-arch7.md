# Abrupt   Changes   in   Ecosystem   Services   and   Well-Being   in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1)
Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 3 :   Enumerator Training Notes

## Overview
- Provides the structure and content ofEnumerator training for the Mozambican woodland household survey.
- Covers rationale, survey formats (paper and tablets in training), sampling aims, and Q&A.
- Emphasizes hands-on practice, iterative feedback, and end-user engagement to ensure data fit for GIS-focused analysis.

## Survey Design and Training Schedule
- Training spans multiple days with a progressive walkthrough of the household survey.
  - Day 1–Day 4: Introduce and practice survey sections up to the income module, with breaks for reflection.
  - Day 5: Practise conducting the entire survey.
  - Each day includes practical exercises in pairs, group discussions, and Q&A to reinforce learning.
- Training uses both paper and electronic formats; tablets were used only in Marrupa District training to illustrate structure and timing.
- Rhythm of sessions follows a pattern: study sections up to income, then hands-on practice; later sessions cover income onwards and full-length practice.

## Tools, Ethics, and Field Materials
- Important points to cover with enumerators:
  - Ethics Form
  - Use of GPS
  - Small weighting scale
  - Abacus
  - Notebook for enumerators
  - Phone to do calculations
- Field tools focus on accurate geospatial capture, transparent calculations, and reliable recording of responses.

## Income Module: Timeframe and Question Sequencing
- Income timeframe is defined as a 12-month period. If a reference harvest or event occurred within the 12 months prior to the interview date, it is included; older events are excluded.
- Example framework (interview date 01.06.2015):
  - Harvests between 01.06.2015 and 01.06.2014 are within scope; harvests before 01.06.2014 are outside scope.
  - If the last harvest was on 01.03.2015, proceed to capture factual data.
- Correct sequence of questions for income:
  1) How much did you earn (harvest) in the last 12 months?
  2) How much of that amount have you used up until now?
  3) How much of that amount have you sold up until now?
- Incorrect sequencing to avoid data misinterpretation:
  - Do not separate gross income, consumption, and sales as independent 12-month figures without tying them to the harvest total and its subsequent uses.
- Specific guidance emphasizes capturing ETH (earned from harvests) first, then deductions/consumptions, then sales, all within the 12-month window.

## Data Quality and GIS Integration Considerations
- Data collection relies on standardized sequencing and clear interpretation to ensure compatibility with map-based analyses.
- GPS usage and precise timing data enable spatial analysis of income patterns across households and woodland areas.
- Structure-specific notes (ethics, GPS, calculation tools) support data quality, traceability, and ease of integration with GIS datasets.
- Consistency in data standards, storage location, and record-keeping is critical due to data being collected across different sites and methods.

## Practical Implications for GIS Specialists
- Training aims to produce georeferenced, clean data suitable for map-based visualization of income and related well-being indicators.
- The emphasis on GPS, timing, and explicit income sequencing supports accurate spatial analyses of harvest-driven income dynamics.
- Be mindful of potential data gaps due to sampling practices or tool usage; ensure alignment with the 12-month income window when integrating with GIS projects.
- Expect to harmonize data from paper and electronic sources; maintain clear metadata on instrument use, dates, and respondent responses for robust GIS mapping and temporal analyses.
