# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 3 : Enumerator Training Notes

## Overview
- Provides the training framework for enumerators conducting the household survey.
- Explains rationale of the ACES survey and how it tests its main hypothesis.
- Details both paper-based and electronic survey formats; tablets used only in Marrupa District during training to illustrate the survey structure.
- Outlines sampling strategy, target households, interview rationale, and Q&A sessions.
- Describes the daily training schedule across five days with progressive surveying exercises and group discussions.

## Training Structure and Schedule
- Day 1: Introduction to the survey and through the household (HH) survey up to the income section.
- Breaks: 15-minute breaks between sessions.
- Day 2: Continuation up to income; practical exercise in groups of two; results discussion and Q&A.
- Day 3–Day 5: Expand coverage from income onward to complete the entire survey, with ongoing group exercises and results discussions.
- Exercise pattern: Groups of two conduct portions of the survey, followed by discussions and clarifications.
- Goal: Build comfort and proficiency with the full survey through repeated, hands-on practice.

## Important Points to Cover (Enumerators)
- Ethics Form: Ensure proper informed consent and ethical handling of respondents.
- GPS: Accurate geographic data collection and recording.
- Small Weighting Scale: Use of a compact weighting method for field calculations.
- Abacus: Tools for on-site calculations to aid data accuracy.
- Notebook for Enumerators: Record-keeping and quick notes during interviews.
- Phone for Calculations: Utilize mobile tools for arithmetic as needed.

## Survey Instrument and Data Collection Details
- Instrumentation: Paper-based survey with an electronic option; tablets used only in a specific training district (Marrupa) to orient students to the process.
- Income Section Framework:
  - Timeframe: 12-month reference period for income data.
  - Core logic: If a harvest occurred within the last 12 months, the question sequence must capture:
    1) How much was earned from the harvest in the last 12 months.
    2) How much of that amount was used up to the present.
    3) How much of that amount was sold up to the present.
  - Example scenario: If the interview date is 01.06.2015, only harvests between 01.06.2014 and 01.06.2015 are included. Harvests outside this window are not counted; if a harvest occurred on 01.03.2015, it is within the window.
  - Correct sequence: Record the actual amounts in this order—earnings, then usage of that amount, then sales of that amount up to now.
  - Incorrect sequencing (pitfalls to avoid): Do not separately sum “last 12 months harvest,” “last 12 months consumption,” and “last 12 months sales” as disjoint categories; this can mix harvests from different timeframes and lead to inconsistent data.
  - Sample questions and responses: Capture the total harvest income, subsequent consumption, and any sales attributable to that same harvest period, progressing in a time-consistent manner.

## Data Quality and Governance Implications (Data Leaders’ Perspective)
- Emphasis on standardized training to promote consistent data collection across enumerators and districts.
- Clear timing and sequencing rules for income data to ensure data validity and comparability across households.
- Use of both paper and electronic formats with a defined transition approach to build data literacy and minimize capture errors.
- GPS and ethics integration indicate attention to metadata, respondent rights, and geospatial context critical for data governance.
- Structured practice and Q&A cycles support ongoing capacity building and reduce data quality risks in the field.

## Practical Takeaways for Data Strategy
- Design field protocols that emphasize time-bound, sequential data capture to preserve data integrity.
- Invest in enumerator training as a core data governance activity to improve consistency and reliability of data assets.
- Provide multiple data capture tools (paper and digital) and phased exposure to digital tools to ease adoption and ensure data traceability.
- Include explicit guidance on data metadata (timeframes, recoding rules), and common pitfalls to minimize misreporting and post-collection corrections.
- Ensure ethical and logistical considerations (ethics forms, GPS) are embedded in data collection workflows to support responsible data stewardship.
