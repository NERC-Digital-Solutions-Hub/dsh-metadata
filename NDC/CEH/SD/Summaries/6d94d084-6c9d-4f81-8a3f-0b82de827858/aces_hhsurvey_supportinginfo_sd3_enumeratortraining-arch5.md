# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 3 : Enumerator Training Notes

## Purpose and Context
- Outlines the rationale of the survey and how it tests ACES's main hypothesis.
- Describes paper-based and electronic survey structures; tablets used only in training (Marrupa District) to familiarize students with the survey and timing.
- Provides a brief overview of the sampling target and interviewee selection.
- Includes Q&A to clarify procedures and expectations.

## Training Structure and Schedule
- Day-by-day format over five days:
  - Day 1 and Day 2: cover the household (HH) survey up to the income section.
  - Day 3 and Day 4: cover the HH survey from the income section onward.
  - Day 5: conduct the entire survey; repeated practice until comfortable.
- Each day includes:
  - Pair-based exercises (two enumerators) practicing sections of the survey.
  - Discussions, results review, and Q&A.
  - Breaks of 15 minutes between segments.
- Objective: build familiarity and confidence with the full survey flow.

## Tools, Ethics, and Compliance Points
- Important topics to cover during training:
  - Ethics Form
  - Use of GPS
  - Small weighting scale
  - Abacus
  - Notebook for enumerators
  - Phone to perform calculations
- Emphasizes appropriate handling of these instruments and recording practices.

## Survey Content and Income Module
- Income timeframe is 12 months. If the reference is “since the last harvest,” the harvest must be within 12 months prior to the interview date.
- Example given to show correct interpretation:
  - Interview date: 01.06.2015
  - Harvests within 01.06.2015 to 01.06.2014 are eligible; harvests before are outside the window.
  - If the harvest is 01.03.2015, it is within 12 months; questions should capture:
    1) How much earned (harvest) in the last 12 months?
    2) How much of that amount has been used up to now?
    3) How much of that amount has been sold up to now?
- Correct sequence emphasizes a cumulative approach to income, use, and sales within the 12-month window.
- Common pitfall (incorrect sequence) is noted, which could mix gross income, consumption, and sales across different reference periods.

## Data Quality and Governance Considerations
- Standardized training ensures consistent administration across enumerators, improving data reliability and comparability.
- Clear temporal framing and question sequencing reduce measurement error and misreporting.
- Documentation and field notes (e.g., survey comments) support data provenance and auditability.
- Alignment between paper and any electronic data collection ensures metadata completeness and facilitates data sharing and reuse.
