# Abrupt   Changes   in   Ecosystem   Services   and   Well-Being   in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 3 :   Enumerator Training Notes

## Purpose and approach
- Enumerator training to collect household survey data addressing ACES's main hypothesis.
- Uses both paper-based and electronic survey formats; tablets used only during Marrupa District training to illustrate structure.
- Provides overview of sampling targets and interviewee selection.
- Includes Q&A and a structured 5-day training schedule with hands-on practice.

## Training schedule and methods
- Day-by-day plan repeating the survey sections with breaks and group exercises.
- Day 1 and Day 2 cover the survey up to the income section; Day 3–5 continue from income onwards and teach full administration.
- Exercises involve pairs (groups of two) conducting portions of the survey and discussing results.
- The pattern continues until students are comfortable administering the entire survey.
- Emphasis on ethics, data collection practices, and resolving questions during practice sessions.

## Important data collection points and tools
- Ethics Form: essential requirement for participation.
- Use of GPS: guidance for spatial data collection.
- Small weighting scale and Abacus: tools for field calculations.
- Notebook for enumerators: for field notes and clarifications.
- Phone: used to perform calculations.

## Income section: 12-month timeframe and data recording
- Timeframe: 12 months. If the question references income from the last harvest, it covers harvests between the interview date and the date exactly 12 months prior.
- Example framework (interview date 01.06.2015):
  - Harvest must be between 01.06.2015 and 01.06.2014 to be within 12 months.
  - A harvest on 01.03.2014 is outside the 12-month window; a harvest on 01.03.2015 is inside.
- Correct sequence of questions:
  1) How much did you earn (harvest) in the last 12 months?
  2) How much of that amount have you used up until now?
  3) How much of that amount have you sold up until now?
- Example scenario:
  - Harvest: 50 kg in the last 12 months.
  - Used: 0 kg up to now.
  - Sold: 0 yet (record 0 and note in survey comments if a sale occurs later, e.g., on 01.07.2015).
- Key distinction:
  - Do not mix across questions. Do not ask for a single “gross income” figure, followed by consumption and then sales for the entire last 12 months.
  - The correct approach traces amounts through harvest, then uses, then sales within the 12-month window to avoid conflating older stock or savings with current-year activity.
