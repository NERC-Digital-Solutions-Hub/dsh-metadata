# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 3: Enumerator Training Notes

## Overview
- Purpose: Provide enumerator training materials for the household survey used to study ecosystem services and well-being, clarifying the rationale, structure, sampling, ethics, and data collection procedures.
- Survey formats: Paper-based and electronic options; tablets used only in Marrupa District (Niassa) during training to illustrate the process, while showing the paper version to set expectations.
- Focus areas: How interviews are conducted, how respondents are selected, how questions are asked and recorded, and how data quality and ethics are maintained.
- Key aims for enumerators: Understand survey flow, maintain consistency, and ensure data accuracy to support the ACES hypothesis.

## Training Structure
- Introduction (Day 1):
  - Welcome enumerators and explain survey rationale and structure (paper and electronic formats).
  - Outline sampling strategy and target households.
  - Q&A session.
- Breaks: 15-minute intervals between modules.
- Progressive data collection practice:
  - Day 1: Practice up to the income section.
  - Day 2: Practice up to the income section with exercises in pairs.
  - Day 3: Practice from income onwards.
  - Day 4: Practice from income onwards with pair exercises.
  - Day 5: Full survey practice in groups.
  - Continue until participants are comfortable with the entire survey.
- Exercises: Pairs interview the respondent, discuss results, and review questions and responses.
  
## Key Topics to Cover
- Ethics Form: Ensuring informed consent and ethical considerations.
- Use of GPS: Recording location data accurately.
- Small weighting scale: How weighting is applied to sampled data.
- Abacus: Tools used for calculations in the field.
- Notebook for enumerators: Keeping field notes and observations.
- Phone to do calculations: Using mobile devices or phones for computations when needed.

## Income Section Details
- Timeframe: All income questions cover a 12-month period.
  - If a question references “since the last harvest,” interpret it as within the last 12 months from the interview date.
  - Example given: Interview date 01.06.2015
    - The last harvest must be between 01.06.2015 and 01.06.2014 to be within 12 months.
    - A harvest on 01.03.2014 is outside 12 months; a harvest on 01.03.2015 is within 12 months.
- Data collection sequence (correct):
  1. How much did you earn (harvest) in the last 12 months?
  2. Of that amount, how much have you used up to now?
  3. Of that amount, how much have you sold up to now?
- Data recording example:
  - If harvested 50 kg, record the actual amount used and sold up to the interview date, with appropriate notes if sales occur after the interview date.
- Correct vs incorrect approaches:
  - Correct approach records the sequence of gross income, then utilization, then sales for the last 12 months.
  - Incorrect approach might mix gross income, consumption, and sales without tying them to the last 12 months or to the same harvest pool, leading to misinterpretation of timing and quantities.

## Practical Guidance for Enumerators
- Readiness to conduct full surveys after progressive practice.
- Maintain clarity about the 12-month reference window to avoid misclassification of harvests and transactions.
- Ensure accurate sequencing of income questions to capture coherent, attributable values over the defined period.
- Use GPS, notebooks, abacus, and calculation tools consistently to aid data integrity.
- Prepare for questions and provide clear explanations to respondents to maintain data quality and ethical standards.
