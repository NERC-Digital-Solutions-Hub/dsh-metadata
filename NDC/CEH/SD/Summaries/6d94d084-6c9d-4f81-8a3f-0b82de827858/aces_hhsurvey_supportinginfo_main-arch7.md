# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Wellbeing in Mozambican Woodlands (ACES): Household Survey Methods and Sampling Strategy

- Objective: The ACES project investigates links between woodland cover, ecosystem service availability, and wellbeing in three districts of Mozambique, using a quantitative household survey to test whether wellbeing changes abruptly with ecosystem service changes due to woodland loss.
- Structure of survey: Captured household composition, assets, income (nine sources), education, health, housing, service access, ecosystem service use, land/agriculture, shock coping strategies, and subjective wellbeing; designed to enable analysis of both inter-household and intra-household variation.

## Study location and village selection

- Three districts representing distinct social-ecological contexts:
  - Marrupa (Niassa Province): subsistence-oriented livelihoods.
  - Gurué (Zambezia Province): major commercial crop production (soya, pulses, sunflower).
  - Mabalane (Gaza Province): livelihoods highly dependent on charcoal production for Maputo.
- 27 villages selected (7 in Mabalane, 10 in Gurué, 10 in Marrupa) using a space-for-time approach with varying intensities of the dominant land use (charcoal, soya, tobacco).
- Villages chosen to have similar soil/vegetation types and an identifiable village leader.

## Household sampling strategy

- Household definition: people “eating from the same pot.”
- Sampling approaches by district:
  - Mabalane: attempted census of all households (small villages).
  - Marrupa and Gurué: stratified random sampling aiming to oversample rich and very poor households, given their importance for ecosystem services use and dependence.
- Validation: Household lists compiled with village secretaries, validated by enumerators; polygamous households treated as separate if each wife eats from a different pot; otherwise one household.

## Household list generation and initial validation

- Household lists created from village-level knowledge, including household head and polygamy status.
- Lists typed in Excel and validated at survey start; unclear or missing households removed if not found or not present in wealth ranking.

## Wealth strata and wealth ranking

- Four strata derived from local perceived wealth: rich (rico), medium (estavel), poor (pobre), very poor (muito pobre).
- Marrupa and Gurué also recorded ordering within strata; duplicates indicate ties.
- An ‘unranked’ stratum existed for households unknown to the wealth ranking participants or not on the initial list; households with conflicting records classified as unranked.
- Post-sampling checks (2016) corrected names in the wealth ranking against the household list; some mismatches led to updates, with some households lacking wealth ranking data as a result.

## Household sampling (detailed)

- Mabalane: approximate complete coverage, final sample 84% of village households (incomplete census).
- Gurué and Marrupa: oversampling of very rich and very poor; target intensities varied by village and strata (e.g., 100% for rich/very poor in some villages, around 50–70% for other strata).
- Random sampling method: Excel random number generator; select households where random number ≤ target sampling intensity.
- Sampling intensities by village and wealth category are provided in district-specific tables.

## Household survey design

- Internal desk review of poverty-environment surveys informed questions (assets, income, land, shocks; household composition, education, health, housing, firewood, coping strategies, food security; subjective wellbeing; agricultural data).
- Aimed to capture both inter-household variation and intra-household variation (collecting individual-level data where possible, e.g., education for household members).
- Income data: comprehensive, covering nine income sources (environmental and non-environmental); follows CIFOR-PEN guidelines to capture income over the last 12 months using mixed recall periods; expenditure data not systematically collected due to attribution challenges and subsistence-based economies.
- District-specific adaptations: survey content adjusted to reflect district drivers of land use change (e.g., include tobacco questions in Marrupa) and lessons from prior rounds.
- Metadata: Final survey questions are detailed in Supporting Document 1; changes between districts are documented in Supporting Document 2.

## Data collection

- Timeframe by district:
  - Mabalane: May–October 2014 (reference year 2013–2014).
  - Marrupa: May–August 2015 (reference year 2014–2015).
  - Gurué: August–December 2015 (reference year 2014–2015).
- Technology: Tablet-based data collection using Open Data Kit (ODK) with locally trained enumerators.
- Personnel: 1 lead research assistant and 30 enumerators from local institutions; interviews conducted in local languages, recorded in Portuguese.
- Units: Local units used for agricultural products; conversions to metric units based on Mozambican National Agricultural Survey (2006) and focus group data (Supporting Documents on units).
- Real-time data capture enabled immediate preliminary analyses and integration with broader ACES components.

## Data cleaning and quality assurance

- In-field daily consistency checks before database submission.
- Post-field-season cleaning included: removal of duplicates, spell-checking, standardizing text, handling missing values.
- Analyses-ready data (e.g., a_household table) were cleaned rigorously; other data tables may require pre-processing by new users.

## Ethical considerations

- Compliance with ESPA ethics requirements and University of Edinburgh standards.
- Written informed consent obtained from participants.
- Anonymization protocol in place to protect identities in dissemination and publications.
- Research staff can provide the anonymization protocol upon request.
