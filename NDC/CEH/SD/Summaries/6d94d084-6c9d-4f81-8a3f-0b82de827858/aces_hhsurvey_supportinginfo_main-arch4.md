# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Wellbeing in Mozambican Woodlands

## Overview
- Aims: Investigate links between woodland cover, ecosystem service availability, and wellbeing in three Mozambican regions; outline methods for the ACES household survey and for compiling household lists and wealth rankings used in sampling.
- Purpose of the ACES Household Survey: Quantitatively assess household socio-economic wellbeing and use/dependence on ecosystem services; test the main hypothesis that wellbeing shifts abruptly as ecosystem services change with woodland loss.
- Survey scope: Captured household composition, assets, income (nine sources), education, health, housing, service access, ecosystem service use, land and agriculture, shock coping, and subjective wellbeing; designed to reflect multidimensional poverty and wellbeing.

## Study location and village selection
- Three districts representing distinct social-ecological contexts:
  - Marrupa District, Niassa Province: subsistence-oriented livelihoods, low infrastructure.
  - Gurué District, Zambezia Province: major commercial crop region (soy, pulses, sunflower) from smallholders.
  - Mabalane District, Gaza Province: high reliance on charcoal production for Maputo.
- 27 villages selected (7 in Mabalane, 10 in Gurué, 10 in Marrupa) using a space-for-time approach, focusing on different intensities of the dominant land use (charcoal, soya, tobacco) in each district.
- Villages chosen to share similar soil/vegetation types and to have a resident village leader.

## Household sampling strategy
- Definition of household: people “eating from the same pot.”
- Sampling approaches by district:
  - Mabalane: attempted census of all households (small villages).
  - Marrupa and Gurué: stratified random sampling with oversampling of rich and very poor households (believed to be key for ecosystem services dependence).
- Household lists: created with input from village secretary; validated by enumerators and refined at survey start; households not found or not on wealth ranking lists were removed if not identifiable.

## Household list generation and initial validation
- Household lists include head name and polygamy status.
- Polygamous households treated as separate households if each wife eats from a different pot; otherwise treated as one household if shared pot.
- Initial lists typed in Excel and validated on-site; inconsistencies resolved or households removed if not verifiable.

## Wealth strata and wealth ranking
- Participatory wealth ranking conducted within each village to create four strata:
  - Rico (rich), Estavel (middle), Pobre (poor), Muito pobre (very poor)
- An additional 'unranked' stratum exists for households unknown to ranking participants or not on the list; households with conflicting records are also 'unranked.'
- Some post-sampling corrections occurred (Sept–Nov 2016): name mismatches between survey respondents and wealth ranking were corrected; households with unresolved identity did not receive wealth ranking data.
- Post-sampling reconciliation ensured alignment between household names, list, and wealth data where possible.

## Household Sampling
- Sampling coverage and intensities varied by district:
  - Mabalane: near-complete census, final coverage ~84% of village households.
  - Gurué and Marrupa: stratified sampling with higher probabilities for rich and very poor strata; 100% sampling target for rich/very poor, up to 50% for other strata; in larger villages, up to 80% in the very poor strata.
- Random sampling achieved via random numbers in Excel; selection based on whether a generated number was below the target intensity for the respective stratum.
- Detailed sampling intensities by village/stratum provided in the supporting tables.

## Household Survey design
- Internal desk review to inform the survey, drawing on:
  - CIFOR-PEN household survey (assets, income, land, shocks)
  - ASSETS household survey (composition, education, health, housing, firewood, food security)
  - Missing Dimensions of Poverty (psychological and subjective wellbeing)
  - Mozambique National Agricultural Survey (food security)
  - Reality Checks (question coding and baseline experience)
- Questions designed to capture inter-household variation (within the village) and intra-household variation (individuals within a household, e.g., education by person).
- Income data: collected across nine income sources (environmental and non-environmental) following CIFOR-PEN guidelines; income assessed over the last 12 months using a mix of irregular and regular income questions; expenditures not systematically captured due to attribution challenges and subsistence-heavy economies.
- District-specific adjustments: some questions (e.g., soy production) tailored to relevance in Gurué; other changes reflect learning from prior rounds.
- Metadata reference: complete survey questions and design details available in supporting documents.

## Data collection
- Field periods and reference years:
  - Mabalane: May–October 2014; reference year 2013–2014.
  - Marrupa: May–August 2015; reference year 2014–2015.
  - Gurué: August–December 2015; reference year 2014–2015.
- Data collection method: tablets with Open Data Kit (ODK); locally trained enumerators; interviews conducted in local languages and recorded in Portuguese.
- Field workflow: trained a lead research assistant and a team of 30 enumerators; real-time data capture enabled immediate preliminary analysis and integration with broader ACES components.
- Measurements: local units used for agricultural products with conversions to metric units guided by Mozambican National Agricultural Survey tables and focus group inputs.

## Data cleaning and quality assurance
- Daily consistency checks during field season before data submission to internal database.
- Post-field-season data cleaning included:
  - Consistency checks, removal of duplicates, spell-checking, standardization of text, handling of missing values.
  - The a_household data table was rigorously cleaned for analyses; other tables may require pre-processing for new analyses.
- Acknowledgement that not all non-published tables have uniform cleaning, so some pre-processing may be necessary for new analyses.

## Ethical considerations
- Compliance with ESPA programme and University of Edinburgh requirements.
- Written informed consent obtained from participants.
- An anonymization protocol implemented to protect identities in write-ups and dissemination.
