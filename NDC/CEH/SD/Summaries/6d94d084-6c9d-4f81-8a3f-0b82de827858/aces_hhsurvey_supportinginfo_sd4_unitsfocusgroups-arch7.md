# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 4 : Units Focus Groups Protocol

## Overview
- Intent is to understand the local units used for key crops and forest products (e.g., maize, beans, soya, cowpeas, grass, poles).
- For each crop, collect both raw and transformed measurement units.
- Record results, photograph the units, and provide guidance materials for household surveys.

## Objectives
- Capture local measurement units for main crops in their raw and transformed forms.
- Include units used across harvesting, storing, and selling contexts.
- Ensure results are documented in multiple formats (Excel, Word, photos) with proper metadata.

## Methodology
- Group size: up to four participants; involve a local merchant if possible.
- Facilitate with a local merchant to access representative units.
- Activities:
  - Gather various units (sacks, baskets, buckets, etc.) used for harvesting, storage, and sale of maize, soya, beans, and forest products.
  - Have participants pack units with the respective crops according to their standards.
  - Weigh each unit.
- Documentation:
  - Record results in Excel: 'Conversion Units TIA, Niassa, Gurue, Agriculture'.
  - Create village-specific records:
    - Excel: 'Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date' (two tabs: raw crop and transformed crop).
    - Word: 'Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date'.
  - Record metadata in each document.
  - Take photographs with descriptive titles; save in a 'Pictures' folder.
  - Print photos for use in household interviews.
- Guidance:
  - Use the folder 'Template for reference_Mocube_Niassa_04_06_2015' as a guide.

## Location and Timing
- Location: In each village of Gurue (Mozambique).
- Timing: Approximately 2 hours per focus group.
- Coordination: Identify and involve a local merchant to assist.

## Outputs and Data Formats
- Primary outputs: unit conversion data for major crops and forest products, across raw and transformed forms.
- Data files:
  - Excel: 'Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date' with two tabs (raw and transformed).
  - Word: 'Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date' with accompanying metadata.
  - Photos: descriptive titles (e.g., "Balde de 14 KG de milho sem transformacao (raw maize)"); descriptions recorded in the Word doc.
- Storage and backup:
  - Save data on external hard drive and Sango.

## Materials
- Scales
- Rope
- Scissors
- Tablet (for photos)
- Pens/Markers
- Index cards

## Data Scope and GIS Relevance
- Focused on capturing spatially relevant, locally used measurement units across villages in Gurue.
- Data can be linked to village locations for GIS mapping of unit types and conversion factors.
- Ensures both raw and transformed forms are available for analyses of production, storage, and sales within ecosystem-service assessments.
- Emphasizes rigorous metadata and consistent file naming to facilitate integration into GIS data products.
