# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 3 : Enumerator Training Notes

- Purpose and rationale
  - Welcome enumerators and explain the survey’s rationale and how it tests ACES's main hypothesis.
  - Clarify both paper-based and electronic survey structures; tablets used only in training in Marrupa District (Niassa) to give students a sense of the survey (duration, number of questions, etc.).

- Sampling strategy and logistics
  - Provide a brief overview of target numbers of households and who to interview, including why those targets were chosen.
  - Outline the plan for how data will be collected and who to engage for support or clarification (topic experts as needed).

- Training schedule and structure
  - Day-by-day progression:
    - Day 1: Review household survey up to income; Q&A.
    - Day 2: Continue up to income; 15-minute break; exercise with paired surveys and results discussion.
    - Day 3: Survey from income onwards; 15-minute break; paired exercise and discussion.
    - Day 4: Survey from income onwards; 15-minute break; paired exercise and discussion.
    - Day 5: Full survey by paired groups; discussion and Q&A; continue practice until comfortable.
  - Breaks and group exercises emphasize hands-on practice and iterative feedback.

- Important topics to cover during training
  - Ethics Form
  - Use of GPS
  - Small weighting scale
  - Abacus
  - Notebook for enumerators
  - Phone to perform calculations

- Data collection specifics
  - Emphasize a hands-on approach to completing the survey up to specified sections, with discussion on results after each segment.
  - Encourage capturing notes in survey comments to document any anomalies or clarifications.

- Income section: timing and sequencing rules
  - Timeframe rule: Income is collected for the last 12 months. For questions phrased as “since the last harvest,” interpret as “since the last harvest within the last 12 months from the interview date.”
  - Example scenario (interview date: 01.06.2015):
    - Harvest must have occurred between 01.06.2015 and 01.06.2014 to be within the 12-month window.
    - If harvest was 01.03.2014, it is outside the 12 months; if harvest was 01.03.2015, it is within 12 months.
  - Correct sequence of income questions (record facts):
    1) How much did you earn (harvest) in the last 12 months?
    2) How much OF THAT PARTICULAR AMOUNT have you used up until now?
    3) How much OF THAT PARTICULAR AMOUNT have you sold up until now?
  - Incorrect sequence to avoid:
    - Not asking for the overall 12-month gross income first, then consumption, then sales, which could mix harvests older than 12 months or misattribute uses or sales.
  - Practical data recording guidance:
    - Record the exact amounts for each step; if, for example, earnings occur in a future date within the 12-month window (e.g., sales planned for 01.07.2015), record 0 for past sales and note the timing in survey comments.
    - Ensure the data reflect the chronological flow: total harvest amount, then deduction (usage), then sales up to the current point in time.

- Data quality and usefulness
  - Focus on producing data that can be self-served by end users via dashboards or reports.
  - Emphasize clear communication of methods, justification for data collection choices, and the need to promote outputs for broader reuse.
  - Stress the value of early prototypes and feedback to improve products.

- Practical outcomes
  - Enumerators gain confidence in administering the survey across days, using both paper and electronic formats as appropriate.
  - The training aims to ensure consistent interpretation of the 12-month income window and correct sequencing to produce reliable data for analysis.
