# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 2 : ACES Household Survey Changes - Mabalane to Marrupa and Marrupa to Gurué

## Overview
- Documents changes between survey rounds to improve data recording, coverage, and granularity.
- Focus areas include income, land and services access, inputs, and new or disaggregated questions to capture broader ecosystem-service and well-being metrics.

## Summary of Changes by Survey Transition

- Mabalane to Marrupa (May–Oct 2014 to May–Aug 2015)
  - Income section: more pre-coded multiple-choice answers for ease of data recording.
  - Income question order reformatted: moved from “quantity sold, price per unit, unit” to “quantity sold, unit, price per unit.”
  - Added questions on inputs used for tobacco production; added question “what type of woodfuel.”
  - Charcoal income: added price per unit for past 12 months.
  - New questions for derived forest income, fishing, and environmental income: added capture of “In what month did you do this activity in the last year?”

- Marrupa to Gurué (Aug–Dec 2015)
  - Land and services access: added questions on land conflicts and access to services, with both 12-month and 5-year timelines; added detail on with whom the land conflict occurred.
  - Direct_forest_income_type: bamboo added as a pre-coded answer.
  - Income module: new answer code for selling location “selling along the street in village/mercado local, rua, a amigos e familiares, directly to consumers/producers/organization.”
  - Income module: brick-making added as an answer code.
  - Wage labour: added questions for “name of the employer” and “type of employment.”
  - Crops: new codes added (e.g., corn as merchant maize); renting out equipment (tractors) added as a code.
  - Soya production: added questions on inputs for commercial and subsistence production.
  - Crop production inputs: disaggregated by crop (organic fertilizer, pesticides, inoculated seeds, improved seeds).
  - Pests: added questions specifying pest types; added a question on the quantity of crop losses due to pests in the last 12 months.
  - Diet/Protein: added questions about the household’s main source of protein.

## Implications for Data Quality and Usability
- Enhances data richness for income sources, forest activities, land conflicts, and agricultural inputs.
- Improves specificity for temporal analysis (monthly activity timing) and sectoral details (types of income, crops, and pests).
- Requires careful data management:
  - Updated coding schemes and metadata to ensure consistency across rounds.
  - Training for field staff on new questions and response codes.
  - Harmonization efforts needed for cross-round comparisons due to reordering and new variables.

## Considerations for Data Leaders
- Balance between greater granularity and respondent burden; pre-coded options reduce recording errors.
- Ensure alignment of new variables with existing data architecture, and update data dictionaries, analysis scripts, and reporting dashboards.
- Plan for longitudinal analyses incorporating 5-year timelines and monthly activity data.

## Next Steps
- Update data dictionaries and metadata to reflect all new questions and codes.
- Review and revise data processing and analysis pipelines to accommodate added variables and re-ordered income section.
- Train survey teams on new modules and ensure rigorous QC for newly introduced questions.
