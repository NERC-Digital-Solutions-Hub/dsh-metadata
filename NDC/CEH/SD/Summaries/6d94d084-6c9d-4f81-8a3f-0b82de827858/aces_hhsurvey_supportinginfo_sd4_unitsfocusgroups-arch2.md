# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1) Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 4 : Units Focus Groups Protocol

- Purpose and Rationale
  - Understand the local units used for main crops and forest products (e.g., maize, beans, soya, cowpeas, grass, poles).
  - Capture both raw and transformed units to enable later standardization and comparison.
  - Record and photograph results to guide household surveys and support data transformation.

- Field Protocol Overview
  - Conduct small group discussions (up to four people), preferably with a local merchant.
  - Have village leaders or merchants bring different units used for harvesting, storing, and selling crops and forest products.
  - Have participants pack the units with the corresponding crop according to their standards; note that packing can affect weight.
  - Weigh each unit precisely.
  - Record results in the designated Excel sheet and organize in village-specific folders and documents.
  - Create two Excel tabs: one for raw crops and one for transformed crops; ensure correct tab placement.
  - Create a Word document for each group with metadata; save and organize accordingly.
  - Take photographs with descriptive titles and store in a separate Pictures folder; print photos to support household interviews.
  - Use the provided template folder (Template for reference_Mocube_Niassa_04_06_2015) as guidance.
  - Involve a local merchant when possible to facilitate accurate unit identification.

- Procedure (step-by-step)
  - Step 1: Assemble a small group (up to four) and, if possible, include a local merchant.
  - Step 2: Ask the village leader/local merchant to bring diverse units used for maize, soya, beans, and forest products.
  - Step 3: Request participants to pack units with the respective crop according to local standards.
  - Step 4: Weigh each packed unit.
  - Step 5: Record results in the Excel sheet named Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date (with two tabs: raw and transformed).
  - Step 6: Save results in the village folder; create and name:
    - Excel: Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date
    - Word: Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date
    - Include metadata in each document.
  - Step 7: Take photographs and save in the Pictures folder; title each image descriptively (e.g., "Balde de 14 KG de milho sem transformacao (raw maize)") and describe in the Word document: Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date.
  - Step 8: Print pictures and provide them to students for household interviews.
  - Note: Refer to the folder Template for reference_Mocube_Niassa_04_06_2015 for guidance.

- Location, Timing, and Participants
  - Where: In each village of Gurue, Mozambique.
  - When: As part of the household survey field activities.
  - Participants: Groups of up to four people; involve a local merchant if possible.

- Materials and Tools
  - Scales, rope, scissors
  - Tablet for taking pictures
  - Pens/markers, index cards
  - External backup options: external hard drive and Sango

- Data Recording, Storage, and Documentation
  - Excel: Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date (two tabs: raw, transformed)
  - Word: Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date
  - Metadata: captured in each document
  - Pictures: saved with descriptive titles in a dedicated folder (Pictures)

- Data Backup and Security
  - Save data on external hard drive and Sango (as referenced)
  - Ensure organized, village-by-village folders and proper naming conventions

- Data Quality and Use
  - Aim for accurate, exhaustive capture of units across main crops (maize, soya, beans) in both raw and transformed forms
  - Seek consistency across villages to enable later data transformation and inter-dataset comparability
  - Ensure underlying data and photos support broader environmental monitoring and policy assessment

- Outputs and Reuse
  - Standardized unit conversion data to feed into larger environmental monitoring datasets
  - Photographic visuals to accompany household survey guidance and training
  - Enhanced ability to compare local units with standardized measures and to integrate with other data sources for ecosystem services and well-being analyses

- Engagement and Ethics
  - Leverage local knowledge through community members (village leaders, local merchants)
  - Follow standardized protocols to facilitate data sharing and potential integration into monitoring portals

- Payment
  - Use the same payment scheme as with other qualitative exercises
