# Overview

- Project and objective
  - The ACES project (Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Wellbeing in Mozambican Woodlands) ran from 2013 to 2018 to study links between woodland cover, ecosystem service availability, and wellbeing in three districts of Mozambique.
  - The document outlines methods for the ACES household survey component and for compiling household lists and wealth rankings that informed sampling.
  - The survey aimed to quantitatively assess household wellbeing and the use/dependence on ecosystem services, testing the hypothesis that wellbeing changes abruptly as ecosystem services change with woodland loss.

- Study location and village selection
  - Three districts representing distinct social-ecological contexts: Mabalane (Gaza), Gurué (Zambezia), Marrupa (Niassa).
  - 27 villages selected: 7 in Mabalane, 10 in Gurué, 10 in Marrupa.
  - Space-for-time substitution along land-use intensity gradients (charcoal, soya, tobacco) with villages chosen to have similar soils/vegetation and a resident village leader.

- Household sampling strategy
  - Household definition: people “eating from the same pot.”
  - Malabane: attempted census due to small village size.
  - Marrupa and Gurué: stratified random sampling to oversample rich and very poor households, based on literature on ecosystem service dependence.

- Household list generation and initial validation
  - Lists prepared by village secretary; details include household head and polygamy status.
  - Polygamous households treated as separate if wives eat from different pots; otherwise grouped.
  - Lists typed in Excel and validated by enumerators at survey start; households not found or unknown in wealth ranking removed from sampling frame.

- Wealth strata and wealth ranking
  - Four strata: rich (rico), medium (estavel), poor (pobre), very poor (muito pobre); an additional unranked stratum for unknown or missing households.
  - In Marrupa and Gurué, ranking within strata recorded; duplicates lead to ties.
  - Post-sampling reconciliation: 40 name mismatches corrected; households without wealth ranking data remain unranked.

- Household sampling (details)
  - Mabalane: near-complete census; final sample covered 84% of households (incomplete census).
  - Gurué and Marrupa: differential sampling by strata; aim 100% for rich and very poor, up to 50% for others; in large poor strata, ~80% sampling of very poor.
  - Random sampling via Excel RNG based on calculated sampling intensities (tables with per-village, per-strata targets).

- Household survey design
  - Internal desk review of poverty-environment survey tools (e.g., CIFOR-PEN, ASSETS, Missing Dimensions of Poverty) to shape the questionnaire.
  - Variables chosen to capture inter-household variation and, where possible, intra-household variation (e.g., education at individual level).
  - Income data emphasized: nine income sources (environmental and non-environmental) using CIFOR-PEN guidelines to capture 12-month income via a mix of irregular and regular income reporting.
  - Expenditure data not systematically collected due to attribution challenges and subsistence-based economies.
  - District-specific adaptations (e.g., soya questions only in Gurué) and learnings from earlier rounds; final question set and unit conversions documented in Supporting Documents.

- Data collection
  - Timelines: Mabalane (May–Oct 2014) for 2013–2014 reference year; Marrupa (May–Aug 2015) and Gurué (Aug–Dec 2015) for 2014–2015 reference year.
  - Mode: tablet-based interviews using Open Data Kit; local enumerators trained; interviews conducted in local languages and recorded in Portuguese.
  - Real-time data collection aided by tablets, enabling immediate preprocessing and feeding into broader ACES components.
  - Units: local units used; conversions to metric applied using 2006 Mozambican National Agricultural Survey tables and focus-group input; conversion files provided with the dataset.

- Data cleaning and quality assurance
  - Daily consistency checks during fieldwork; post-season cleaning included deduplication, spell checks, and normalization of text entries.
  - Rigorous cleaning of key analytical tables (e.g., a_household); other non-published tables may require pre-processing.
  - Acknowledgement that not all data have been cleaned to the same standard, so secondary users may need additional pre-processing.

- Ethical considerations
  - Compliance with ESPA program and University of Edinburgh ethics requirements.
  - Written informed consent obtained; anonymization protocol implemented to protect individual identities in dissemination.
  - Anonymization and data governance details available from the lead dataset author.

- Documentation and metadata
  - Final survey questions and variable details are provided in Supporting Document 1 (ACEs Household Survey Complete Metadata).
  - Additional Supporting Documents cover survey changes, unit conversions, and enumerator training.

- Implications for Data Stewardship
  - Alignment with international guidelines (e.g., CIFOR-PEN) while adapting to local contexts; provides a clear data provenance trail through documentation, validation steps, and post-hoc reconciliations.
  - Emphasizes metadata availability, unit standardization, and anonymization to support responsible data sharing and reuse.
  - Notes potential limitations for reuse (some data tables not fully cleaned; post-sampling name corrections may affect reproducibility if not carefully tracked).
  - Data capture via digital tools with real-time QA supports data integrity and auditability, but users should review Supporting Documents for complete methodological context.
