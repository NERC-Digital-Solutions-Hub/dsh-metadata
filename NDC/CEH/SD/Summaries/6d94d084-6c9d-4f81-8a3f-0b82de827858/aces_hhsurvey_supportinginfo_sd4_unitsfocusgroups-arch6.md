# Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1)
 Households Survey Data Supplementary Document 4 : Units Focus Groups Protocol

- Rationale
  - Understand the units local people use for crops and forest products (maize, beans, soya, cowpeas, grass, poles, etc.).
  - Obtain measured units for each crop in raw and transformed forms.
  - Record results and photograph them to guide household surveys.

- Time
  - Approximately 2 hours per focus group session.

- How to do it (procedural steps)
  1. Convene a small group (up to four people), preferably with a local merchant.
  2. Have village leader or local merchant bring different units used to harvest, store, and sell main crops (maize, soya, beans) and forest products.
  3. Ask locals to pack units with the respective crop according to their standards; note that packaging (e.g., bag size) can affect measurements.
  4. Weigh each unit.
  5. Record results in Excel sheet named 'Conversion Units TIA, Niassa, Gurue, Agriculture'.
  6. Save results in the village folder and in two documents:
     - Excel: 'Village-name_Crop and direct forest products units conversion_date' (two tabs: raw crop and transformed crop).
     - Word: 'Village_name_Units Focus Group_Date'.
     - Record metadata in each document.
  7. Take photos and save them in the 'Pictures' folder with descriptive titles (e.g., 'Balde de 14 KG de milho sem transformacao (raw maize)'); record descriptions in the Word document.
     - Print pictures and hand them out to students for household interviews.
  8. Use the folder 'Template for reference_Mocube_Niassa_04_06_2015' as guidance.

- Data backup
  - Save data on an external hard drive and on Sango (local language) data stores.

- Data management and documentation
  - Strive for accuracy and exhaustiveness; obtain units for main crops (maize, soya, beans) in both raw and transformed forms and for different purposes (harvesting, storing, selling).
  - Ensure correct tab usage in Excel (raw vs transformed) and proper folder/document organization.
  - Include metadata in each document to facilitate future use.

- Payment
  - Use the same payment as with other qualitative exercises.
