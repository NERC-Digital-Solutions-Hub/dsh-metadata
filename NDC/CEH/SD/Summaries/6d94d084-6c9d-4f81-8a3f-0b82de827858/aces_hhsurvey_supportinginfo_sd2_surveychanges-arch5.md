Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Well-Being in Mozambican Woodlands (NE/K010395/1)
Household Survey Data Supplementary Document 2 : ACES Household Survey Changes - Mabalane to Marrupa and Marrupa to Gurué
Survey changes between the Mabalane survey round (May-October 2014) and the Marrupa survey round (May - August 2015)
- More pre-coded multiple-choice answers in the income section to ease data recording.
- Reordered income questions (e.g., changing the sequence to quantity sold, unit, price per unit).
- Added questions on inputs used for tobacco production for commercial and subsistence purposes (including 'what type of woodfuel').
- In the variable for 'Charcoal produced past 12 month', added price per unit.
- Added questions for derived forest income, fishing, and environmental income, including a prompt for the month in which the activity occurred in the last year.

Survey changes between the Marrupa survey round and the Gurué survey round (August - December 2015)
- Added questions on land conflicts and access to services, with both a 12-month and a 5-year time horizon; included a prompt to specify with whom the land conflict occurred.
- Bamboo added as a pre-coded answer in 'direct_forest_income_type'.
- New answer code added for primary/secondary selling place in income (e.g., 'selling along the street in village/mercado local, RUA, to friends and family, directly to consumers/producers/organization').
- 'Brick-making' added as an answer code in the income section.
- Wage labour section: added questions for 'name of the employer and type of employment'.
- New answer codes added to crops section (e.g., corn (merchant maize)) and renting out equipment (e.g., tractors).
- Added questions on inputs used for soya production for commercial and subsistence purposes.
- Inputs used in crop production disaggregated by crop (previously aggregated).
- Added questions on specific pest types and a quantity of crops lost due to pests (further detail on losses).
- Added questions about the household’s main source of protein.

Implications for data stewardship and governance
- These changes affect data compatibility and longitudinal comparability across rounds.
- Need for comprehensive metadata and documentation to capture variable-level changes, codes, and question wording.
- Requires versioned data dictionaries, variable crosswalks, and careful tracking of which variables exist in which rounds.
- Enhanced data quality opportunities, but also potential for inconsistencies due to reordering, new questions, and new codes.

Recommended actions for data stewards
- Create a versioned metadata release that documents all added/modified variables, codes, question order, and disaggregation changes by round.
- Develop crosswalks linking old and new variable names/codes to preserve comparability.
- Update data dictionaries and codebooks with notes on new modules (land conflicts, access to services, protein source) and disaggregated inputs by crop.
- Implement data quality checks to flag round-specific changes and potential analysis implications (e.g., trends across rounds with new questions or altered response formats).
- Ensure dataset-level disclosures clearly indicate round-specific changes and any limitations to comparability in published analyses.
