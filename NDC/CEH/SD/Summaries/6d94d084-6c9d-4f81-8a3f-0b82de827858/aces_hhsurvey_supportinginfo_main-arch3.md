# Overview

- Project and purpose
  - The ACES project (Abrupt Changes in Ecosystem Services and Wellbeing in Mozambican Woodlands) ran from June 2013 to March 2018.
  - Objective: investigate links between woodland cover, ecosystem service availability, and wellbeing in three regions of Mozambique.
  - This document details the methods for the ACES household survey component and for compiling household lists and wealth rankings informing sampling.

- Survey aims and structure
  - The ACES Household Survey quantitatively assessed household socio-economic wellbeing, use of and dependence on ecosystem services.
  - Designed to test the main hypothesis: abrupt changes in wellbeing as ecosystem services change with woodland loss.
  - Followed a classical 'HAI+ format' and collected data on household composition, assets, income, plus special sections on education, health, housing, service access, ecosystem service use, land/agriculture, shock coping strategies, and subjective wellbeing.
  - Informed by multidimensional approaches to poverty and wellbeing in Mozambique; included both objective and subjective wellbeing measures.
  - Data collection emphasized nine income sources (environmental and non-environmental) to capture comprehensive household income; expenditure data were not systematically captured.

- Study location and village selection
  - Data collected in three districts representing distinct social-ecological contexts:
    - Marrupa District, Niassa Province: subsistence-oriented livelihoods.
    - Gurué District, Zambezia Province: major smallholder commercial crops (soya, pulses, sunflower).
    - Mabalane District, Gaza Province: livelihoods highly dependent on charcoal production.
  - 27 villages selected (7 in Mabalane, 10 in Gurué, 10 in Marrupa) using a space-for-time approach, with varying intensities of the dominant land-use (charcoal, soya, tobacco) to reflect different drivers of woodland change.
  - Villages chosen to be comparable in soil/vegetation types and to have a resident village leader.

- Household sampling strategy
  - Defined a household as people eating from the same pot.
  - Sampling approaches varied by district:
    - Mabalane: attempted census of all households (relatively small villages).
    - Marrupa and Gurué: stratified random sampling with oversampling of rich and very poor households (believed to be particularly dependent on ecosystem services).
  - Household lists were created by village officials, including household head and polygamy status; polygamous households treated as separate if each head ate from a different pot.
  - Validation occurred at the start of the survey; mis-specified or unknown households were removed or adjusted.

- Wealth strata and wealth ranking
  - Participatory wealth ranking within each village produced four strata: rich (rico), middle (estavel), poor (pobre), very poor (muito pobre), plus an 'unranked' stratum.
  - In Marrupa and Gurué, ranks within strata were recorded (best-off first; duplicates indicated ties).
  - Post-sampling checks compared household names from the wealth ranking with the survey list; discrepancies were resolved, and households with unresolved matches were marked as unranked or updated as needed.
  - Some adjustments occurred after data collection to align wealth rankings with survey records; 40 cases showed name mismatches between wealth ranking and survey records, often due to misrecording household IDs.

- Household sampling execution
  - Mabalane: attempted to sample all households; final sample covered 84% of village households (incomplete census).
  - Gurué and Marrupa: stratified sampling by wealth strata with varying intensities:
    - Targeted 100% sampling for rich and very poor strata; up to 50% for others.
    - In larger villages with large poor strata, aiming for 80% in the very poor strata.
  - Random sampling used a random number generator to select households based on the specified intensity.

- Household survey design
  - Internal desk review of existing poverty-environment surveys informed design, drawing on:
    - CIFOR-PEN: assets, income, land, shocks.
    - ASSETS: household composition, education, health, housing, firewood, food security.
    - Missing Dimensions of Poverty (OPHI): subjective wellbeing questions.
    - Mozambican National Agricultural Survey: food security questions.
    - Reality Checks (ORGUT et al.): coding and baseline questions.
  - Questions aimed to capture inter-household variation (across households within villages) and intra-household variation (where possible for education and other attributes).
  - Emphasis on robust income data across nine sources; expenditure not systematically collected due to attribution challenges and subsistence-oriented economies.
  - Survey content adapted across districts to reflect local land-use drivers (e.g., tobacco questions in Marrupa; soya in Gurué) and lessons from piloting.

- Data collection
  - Fieldwork conducted in:
    - Mabalane: May–October 2014 (reference year 2013–2014).
    - Marrupa: May–August 2015 (reference year 2014–2015).
    - Gurué: August–December 2015 (reference year 2014–2015).
  - Data collected on tablets using Open Data Kit (ODK) with locally trained enumerators.
  - Local languages used for interviews; data recorded in Portuguese.
  - Enumerators trained comprehensively; data conversions to metric units based on Mozambican 2006 National Agricultural Survey and focus groups.
  - Real-time data collection facilitated immediate preliminary analyses linked to other ACES components.

- Data cleaning and quality assurance
  - Daily consistency checks during field season; data submitted to an internal database.
  - Post-field-season cleaning included:
    - Consistency checks, removal of duplicates, spell-checking, standardizing text, handling missing values.
    - Cleaned data tables (e.g., a_household) prior to analysis; some non-published data tables may require pre-processing by new analysts.

- Ethical considerations
  - Ethics approvals obtained from ESPA program and the University of Edinburgh.
  - Participants gave written informed consent.
  - Anonymization protocol established to protect identities in dissemination and reporting.
  - Further details available from the lead dataset author.

- Notes for users and data governance
  - Metadata and Supporting Documents accompany the dataset, including complete metadata and details of survey instruments, unit conversions, and changes across districts.
  - Recognition that data sharing and governance considerations (e.g., anonymization, consent) apply to the underlying datasets.
