# A set of ~50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, DNA mutations) for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex, which were selected for inclusion on a 50K SNP Axiom array

## What has been recorded and what form does the data take?
- A dataset comprising approximately 50,000 SNPs for Scots pine and closely related Pinus mugo complex members, intended for inclusion on a 50K SNP Axiom genotyping array.

## When were the data collected?
- Data assembled during 2016.

## How were the data collected?
- The array includes 49,829 SNPs from multiple sources:
  - 49,052 SNPs from transcriptome sequencing of four pine species: Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, and P. uliginosa (Wachowiak et al. 2015); includes SNPs common to all species and SNPs fixed in one species but polymorphic in others.
  - A filtering step by the array manufacturer (Thermo Fisher) based on p-convert quality, with a list of recommended and non-recommended SNP probes; SNPs with polymorphisms within 35 bp avoided.
  - An additional 578 SNPs from 279 candidate genes previously resequenced in related population genetics studies (Kujala & Savolainen 2012; Mosca, Eckert, Di Pierro, et al. 2012; Palme, Wright, & Savolainen 2008; Wachowiak, Balk, & Savolainen 2009; Wachowiak, Zaborowska, et al. 2018).
  - mtDNA variation: 14 SNPs discovered by Donnelly et al. (2017).
  - 185 SNPs putatively linked to susceptibility to Dothistroma needle blight (from Pinus radiata; ENA ERS1034542-53).

## Why were the data collected? For what purpose?
- To manufacture a genotyping array for Scots pine and its close relatives within the Pinus mugo complex.

## Who was responsible for the collection and interpretation of data?
- Stephen Cavers (scav@ceh.ac.uk)

## Completeness
