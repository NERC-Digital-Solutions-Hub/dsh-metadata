# A set of ~50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex, which were selected for inclusion on a 50K SNP Axiom array

## What is included

- Approximately 49,829 SNPs on the 50K SNP Axiom array for Scots pine and related Pinus mugo complex members.
- SNPs originate from multiple sources outlined below, with totals summing to 49,829.

## Data collection timing

- Data were assembled in 2016.

## How data were collected (methods and instrumentation)

- Primary source: 49,052 SNPs from transcriptome sequencing across four pine species (Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, P. uliginosa; Wachowiak et al. 2015).
  - Included SNPs common to all species and SNPs fixed in one species but polymorphic in others.
- Quality filtering by the array manufacturer (Thermo Fisher) based on p-convert values; provided lists of recommended and non-recommended SNP probes, avoiding SNPs with polymorphisms within 35 bp.
- Additional SNPs:
  - 578 SNPs from candidate genes (279 genes) resequenced in prior population genetic studies (Kujala & Savolainen 2012; Mosca, Eckert, Di Pierro, et al. 2012; Palmé, Wright, & Savolainen 2008; Wachowiak, Balk, & Savolainen 2009; Wachowiak, Zaborowska, et al. 2018).
  - 14 mtDNA SNPs targeted from Donnelly et al. 2017.
  - 185 SNPs putatively associated with susceptibility to Dothistroma needle blight (from Pinus radiata; ENA ERS1034542-53).

## Why data were collected (purpose)

- To manufacture a genotyping array for Scots pine and close relatives in the Pinus mugo complex.

## Responsibility (collection and interpretation)

- Stephen Cavers (scav@ceh.ac.uk)

## Completeness

- Not specified in the provided excerpt; the document poses the completeness question but does not include an answer.
