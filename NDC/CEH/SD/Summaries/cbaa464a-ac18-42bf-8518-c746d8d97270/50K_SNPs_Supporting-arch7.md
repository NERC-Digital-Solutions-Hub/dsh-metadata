# A set of ~50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, DNA mutations) for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex, which were selected for inclusion on a 50K SNP Axiom array

## What is the data?
- A set of ~50,000 SNPs for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related Pinus mugo complex members, intended for a 50K SNP Axiom genotyping array.

## When were the data collected?
- Data were assembled during 2016.

## How were the data collected?
- The array comprises 49,829 SNPs from several sources:
  - The majority (49,052) from transcriptome sequencing of four pine species: Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, and P. uliginosa. These included SNPs common to all species and SNPs fixed in one species but polymorphic in others.
  - The array was filtered by the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher) based on p-convert values; a list of recommended and non-recommended SNP probes was used, with avoidance of SNPs having polymorphisms within 35 bp.
  - An additional set of SNPs (N = 578) from candidate genes (N = 279), resequenced in prior population genetic studies.
  - Variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) targeted using 14 SNPs discovered by Donnelly et al. (2017).
  - SNPs putatively associated with susceptibility to Dothistroma needle blight (N = 185) discovered in Pinus radiata (ENA accession numbers ERS1034542-53).

## Why were the data collected?
- For the manufacture of a genotyping array for Scots pine and its close relatives in the Pinus mugo complex.

## Who was responsible for the collection and interpretation of data?
- Stephen Cavers, scav@ceh.ac.uk
