# A set of ~50,000 SNPs for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex, selected for inclusion on a 50K SNP Axiom array

## What is included and form of the data
- A set of ~50,000 SNPs for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related Pinus mugo complex members
- Selected for inclusion on a 50K SNP Axiom array

## When data were collected
- Data were assembled during 2016

## How data were collected
- Total SNPs: 49,829
- Sources:
  - 49,052 SNPs from transcriptome sequencing of four pine species: Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, P. uliginosa (Wachowiak et al. 2015)
  - SNPs filtered by Thermo Fisher based on p-convert quality; included whether SNPs were common to all species or fixed in one and polymorphic in others; SNP probes avoided if polymorphisms within 35 bp
  - 578 SNPs from candidate genes (N=279) resequenced in prior studies (Kujala & Savolainen 2012; Mosca et al. 2012; Palmé et al. 2008; Wachowiak et al. 2009; Wachowiak et al. 2018)
  - 14 mtDNA SNPs identified by Donnelly et al. (2017)
  - 185 SNPs potentially associated with susceptibility to Dothistroma needle blight (from Pinus radiata; ENA ERS1034542-53)

## Why data were collected
- For manufacture of a genotyping array for Scots pine and close relatives in the Pinus mugo complex

## Who was responsible for the collection and interpretation of data
- Stephen Cavers, scav@ceh.ac.uk

## Completeness
- The completeness section is present but does not provide details on data absence or exclusion.
