# A set of ~50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, DNA mutations) for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex, which were selected for inclusion on a 50K SNP Axiom array

## Data at a glance
- Data type: SNP array data comprising ~50,000 SNPs for Scots pine and closely related Pinus mugo complex members.
- Purpose: For manufacture of a genotyping array (50K SNP Axiom array).
- Assembly date: 2016.
- Primary data sources and composition:
  - Total SNPs: 49,829
  - From transcriptome sequencing across four pine species (Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, P. uliginosa): 49,052 SNPs (shared or species-specific/polymorphic patterns)
  - Candidate genes: 578 SNPs from 279 genes, resequenced in prior studies
  - Mitochondrial DNA: 14 SNPs
  - Disease-association: 185 SNPs putatively linked to susceptibility to Dothistroma needle blight (from Pinus radiata)
- Data provenance and oversight:
  - Responsibility for collection and interpretation: Stephen Cavers (scav@ceh.ac.uk)
- Completeness: Not provided in this excerpt; the 6. Completeness item is present but no details are given here.

## Methods and data provenance
- Data sources and selection:
  - Majority (49,052) SNPs derived from transcriptome sequencing across four pine species.
  - Additional SNPs from candidate genes (578 SNPs in 279 genes) previously resequenced.
  - mtDNA SNPs (14) targeted from prior mtDNA work.
  - SNPs associated with Dothistroma needle blight susceptibility (185) drawn from Pinus radiata studies.
- Quality filtering and array design:
  - SNPs filtered by array manufacturer (Thermo Fisher) using p-convert criteria to ensure quality for array inclusion.
  - Excluded SNPs with polymorphisms within 35 base pairs to avoid probe interference.
- Data usage context:
  - Purpose is to enable robust genotyping for Scots pine and close relatives, supporting downstream genetic analyses and breeding/utilization programs.

## Notes for monitoring framework stakeholders
- This dataset provides a comprehensive SNP resource for Scots pine and related species, designed for high-throughput genotyping via a 50K SNP Axiom array.
- Key considerations for monitoring:
  - Documented data provenance and assembly date support traceability for policy appraisal and decision-making.
  - Clear filtering criteria (p-convert quality, absence of proximal polymorphisms) enhance data reliability for monitoring outputs.
  - Data completeness details are not provided in this excerpt; ensure metadata fully documents any missing data or exclusions before reuse.
  - Provenance and accessibility: data origins and responsible contact are specified, aiding stakeholder engagement and data governance.
