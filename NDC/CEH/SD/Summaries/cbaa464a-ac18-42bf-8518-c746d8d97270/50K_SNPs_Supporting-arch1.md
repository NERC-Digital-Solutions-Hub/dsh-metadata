# A set of ~50,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, DNA mutations) for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex, which were selected for inclusion on a 50K SNP Axiom array

## Overview
- A genotyping array for Scots pine and its close relatives in the Pinus mugo complex, containing 49,829 SNPs sourced from multiple data sets.

## Data content
- Total SNPs on the array: 49,829.
- Primary source: transcriptome sequencing from four pine species (Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, P. uliginosa). This set includes SNPs common to all species and SNPs fixed in one species but polymorphic in others.
- Additional SNPs:
  - 578 SNPs from 279 candidate genes, resequenced in prior population genetic studies.
  - 14 mtDNA SNPs targeted from Donnelly et al. (2017).
  - 185 SNPs putatively associated with susceptibility to Dothistroma needle blight (from Pinus radiata).
  
## Collection timeline
- Data assembled during 2016.

## Methods and sources
- Sources and filtering:
  - The majority (49,052) SNPs from Wachowiak et al. 2015 (transcriptome data across four species).
  - SNPs filtered by array manufacturer (Thermo Fisher) based on p-convert values; a list of recommended vs non-recommended probes was used, avoiding SNPs with polymorphisms within 35 bp.
  - Additional SNPs from candidate genes (N=279 genes; N=578 SNPs) from prior population genetic studies (Kujala & Savolainen 2012; Mosca et al. 2012; Palmé et al. 2008; Wachowiak et al. 2009; Wachowiak, Zaborowska et al. 2018).
  - mtDNA SNPs from Donnelly et al. 2017 (N=14).
  - Dothistroma needle blight association SNPs (N=185) identified in Pinus radiata.
  
## Purpose
- For manufacture of a genotyping array for Scots pine and its close relatives in the Pinus mugo complex.

## Data custodians and contact
- Responsible for collection and interpretation: Stephen Cavers (scav@ceh.ac.uk).

## Completeness
- The document poses a completeness question but does not provide an explicit answer regarding data absence or inclusion beyond the described SNP sets and sources.
