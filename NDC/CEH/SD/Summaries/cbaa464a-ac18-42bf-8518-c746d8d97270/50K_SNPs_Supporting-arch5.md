# A set of ~50,000 SNPs for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex, selected for inclusion on a 50K SNP Axiom array

## Overview
- Describes a SNP set intended for use on a 50K SNP Axiom genotyping array for Scots pine and closely related Pinus mugo complex species.

## Data content
- Total SNPs: 49,829
- Main source: transcriptome sequencing of four pine species (Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, P. uliginosa) as per Wachowiak et al. 2015
  - SNPs selected with p-convert-based quality filtering by Thermo Fisher; SNP probes avoided if polymorphisms present within 35 bp
- Additional SNPs by category:
  - 578 SNPs from candidate genes (279 genes) resequenced in prior population studies
  - 14 SNPs targeting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation (Donelly et al. 2017)
  - 185 SNPs putatively associated with susceptibility to Dothistroma needle blight (from Pinus radiata; ENA accession ERS1034542-53)

## Data collection and provenance
- Data assembled during 2016
- Purpose: manufacture of a genotyping array for Scots pine and its close relatives in the Pinus mugo complex

## Methods and curation
- SNPs selected for the array by Thermo Fisher based on p-convert quality
- Filtering to avoid SNPs with polymorphisms within 35 bp
- Data elements include SNP identity and origins from multiple sources (transcriptome sequencing, candidate gene resequencing, mtDNA, disease-associated SNPs)

## Completeness
- Completeness section exists but is not filled; no explanation provided for data inclusion/exclusion or missing elements in this record
