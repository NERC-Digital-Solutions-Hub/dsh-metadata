## Overview
- Data from a grazing experiment in Somerford Mead, a floodplain meadow on the River Thames near Wytham, upstream of Oxford.
- Time period: 1987–2014 (baseline 1987–1989; treatment response 1991–2013; final survey 2014).
- Experimental design: 3 grazing treatments (Cattle, Sheep, No grazing) each replicated 3 times across 9 plots; 10 quadrats per plot (90 quadrats total); plots permanently marked for time-series sampling.
- Hay is cut in July each year; treatments applied from August 1991 onward.

## Data collected and units
- Plant species recorded per 1 m x 1 m quadrat with relative abundance estimates.
- Abundance formats by period:
  - 1987–1989 baseline: abundance on a 1–16 scale based on the number of 16 subcells within a quadrat where the species occurred.
  - 1991–2013: same 1–16 scale.
  - 2014 final survey: abundance as a percentage of ground area covered (1–100 scale).
- Final column in each table indicates the total number of species identified in the quadrat.

## Collection methods and data formats
- Field method: quadrats subdivided into 16 equal cells; presence/counts recorded on field proformas; only the number of cells with the species recorded is stored in the database (1991–2013).
- Plot locations provided (NGR coordinates) in Table 1; plots positioned within a 10 m x 10 m stand (Figure 1) and quadrat subdivision details (Figure 2).
- Original paper proformas held by the Floodplain Meadows Partnership; data digitised in 2022 by M.J. Stone.

## Quality control and corrections
- Taxonomy updated to match Stace’s New flora of the British Isles (4th ed., 2019) to standardise names.
- Species counts and arithmetic checked and corrected where needed (Dr. M.J. Stone).
- Data collected by multiple recorders; annual QA performed by Alison McDonald (1987–2013) or J.O. Mountford (2014).
- Documented corrections for several years (notably 1994–1999) due to discrepancies between printed and handwritten summaries, miscopying, and handling of pseudospecies; numerous species identifications recorded as pseudospecies or genus-level identifications.
- 2000 data absent; 2014 data entries sometimes non-numeric (e.g., plus signs or ticks) converted to “p” to indicate very small presence (<1%).

## Data structure and access
- Data are organized in files where:
  - Columns = species names
  - Rows = quadrats (each quadrat identified in the first column)
  - Cells = abundance values or blanks if absent
  - Final column = total species per quadrat
- Some historical data (1987–1989) lack field sheets; 1994 notes used for reconciliation.
- Data and field sheets originally stored with Floodplain Meadows Partnership; digitised version includes metadata and taxonomic harmonisation.

## Experimental design and sampling regime (details)
- Nine plots constructed from three treatments with three replicates each; each plot has a central steel scaffold marker.
- Plot coordinates (NGR) provided; 10 quadrats per plot arranged within each 10 m x 10 m stand.
- Abundance within quadrats during 1991–2013 determined by counting the number of 0.25 m x 0.25 m cells in which a species occurred; location within quadrats follows a fixed grid (Figure 2).

## Notes on scope, limitations, and references
- 1987–1989 data lack field data sheets; later data rely on alternative summaries.
- 1994 data contain inconsistencies between field sheets and summaries; reconciled during data cleaning.
- 199-2000 period contains tallies with potential duplications or misclassifications; corrections applied.
- 2014 final survey conducted by UKCEH; data aligned to percent cover scale.
- Key references: McDonald (2001) on succession during flood-meadow recreation; Stace (2019) updated taxonomy.
