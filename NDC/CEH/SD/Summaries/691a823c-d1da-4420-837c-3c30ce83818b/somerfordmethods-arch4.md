# Somerfordmethods.docx

## Overview
- Documents a grazing experiment in Somerford Mead, a floodplain meadow on the River Thames upstream of Oxford.
- Timeframe: data collected 1987–2014; main data collection during June each year.
- Objective: record plant species presence and relative abundance in 1 m x 1 m quadrats across experimental plots subjected to different grazing treatments.

## Collection Methods
- Site: Somerford Mead, Wytham parish; 9 plots arranged as three grazing treatments (Cattle, Sheep, No grazing) with three replicates each.
- Plot setup: plots sampled with ten 1 m x 1 m quadrats per plot (90 quadrats total); plots permanently marked with metal pegs.
- Treatments: since August 1991, one of three treatments applied per plot; hay cut in July annually.
- Recording approach: abundance of each species recorded within each quadrat; 16 subcells per quadrat used for abundance estimates (cell-based counting).
- Data capture: field proformas used; original field sheets held by Floodplain Meadows Partnership; 9 plot coordinates provided (NGR).

## Data Formats and Units
- Three data variants corresponding to time periods:
  - 1987–1989 (baseline): abundance as number of cells (1–16) where species occurs.
  - 1991–2013 (response): same 1–16 scale for abundance.
  - 2014 (final): abundance as percentage ground cover (1–100).
- Final column in each table indicates the total number of species identified in each quadrat.
- Notes on units:
  - 1997–2013: abundance unit 1–16 (cell occurrence).
  - 2014: abundance unit 1–100 (percent cover).

## Quality Control and Provenance
- Taxonomic standardization: names updated in 2022 to match Stace’s New Flora of the British Isles (4th ed., 2019) to resolve synonyms.
- Data verification: species counts per quadrat checked by Dr M.J. Stone; arithmetic corrections made as needed.
- Data collection: raw data from multiple recorders, quality assured annually by Dr A. McDonald (1987–2013) or J.O. Mountford (2014).
- Documentation and corrections: extensive notes on discrepancies (1987–1989 gaps; 1994 discrepancies between printed and handwritten summaries; 1994 and later corrections for field vs. summary data; handling of pseudospecies and taxonomic ambiguities).

## Data Structure
- Each file presents a table:
  - Columns: species names.
  - Rows: quadrats (one per quadrat, named in the first column).
  - Cells: abundance of each species in the corresponding quadrat; blanks indicate absence.
  - Final column: total species per quadrat.
- Some fields include pseudospecies entries and non-numeric annotations (e.g., plus signs, ticks) later standardized (e.g., replaced with "p" for presence <1%).

## Experimental Design and Sampling
- Plot layout: nine plots with a central steel scaffolding pole; precise NGR coordinates provided.
- Quadrat arrangement: within each plot, ten quadrats subdivided into 16 equal cells (0.25 m x 0.25 m) for 1991–2013 abundance estimation.
- Field workflow: species occurrence in cells recorded on paper proformas; database stores only the count of cells in which a species occurred.
- Documentation: field recording methods and quadrat layouts illustrated in referenced figures; field sheets and digitization details recorded.

## Corrections, Assumptions and Notes
- 1987–1989: no field data sheets available; data sourced from a separate frequency data document.
- 1994: discrepancies between handwritten vs printed species lists; several misidentifications corrected; ongoing checks against field sheets.
- 1997–2013: numerous corrections for miscopied species, pseudospecies, and taxonomic updates; some entries consolidated or clarified (e.g., grasses, bryophytes).
- 2000s: frequent notes on ambiguous identifications (genus vs species level) and Dutch pseudospecies terminology; several entries recoded or merged.
- 2014: some non-numeric annotations standardized (e.g., "+" or ticks replaced with "p" to denote very small presence).
- Additional data handling: some entries listed as multiple forms or unreliable identifications were retained with caveats or converted to genus-level entries where appropriate.
