## Overview
- Long-term grazing experiment in a restored floodplain meadow (Somerford Mead, Wytham, River Thames, upstream of Oxford).
- Investigates effects of three grazing treatments (Cattle, Sheep, No grazing) on plant community composition over time.
- Data collected from 1 m x 1 m quadrats within 9 plots (10 m x 10 m stands), with permanent plot marking.

## Data collection and scope
- Time span: 1987–2013 (field data) plus a final survey in 2014.
- Lead investigator: Dr Alison McDonald; also involved are student helpers (including Wageningen, NL).
- Sampling: 10 quadrats per plot, total of 90 quadrats; plots permanently marked with steel pegs; NGR coordinates provided for each plot.
- Hay management: meadow cut for hay in July each year; treatments applied from August 1991 onward.
- Location and design details: plots arranged with clear quadrat locations; final survey by UKCEH in 2014.

## Data formats and units
- Three data variants:
  - 1987–1989 (Baseline): abundance per species per quadrat based on the number of times the species occurred across 16 cells within the quadrat (scale 1–16).
  - 1991–2013 (Response): same 16-cell cell-count abundance (scale 1–16).
  - 2014 (Final): projected area covered by each species within the quadrat (percentage; scale 1–100); final column lists the total number of species per quadrat.
- Data structure: each file is a table with species as columns and quadrats as rows; blanks indicate absence; final column shows total species per quadrat.

## Quality control and data integrity
- Taxonomic standardization: names updated in 2022 to Stace’s New Flora of the British Isles (2019) to resolve synonyms.
- Data verification: species counts checked by Dr M.J. Stone; arithmetic corrections made as needed.
- Field data provenance: raw data collected by multiple recorders; annual QA performed by Dr A. McDonald (1987–2013) or J.O. Mountford (2014).
- Field sheets and paper proformas: original field sheets held by Floodplain Meadows Partnership; 2014 data digitized at UKCEH.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Plot layout: 9 plots, each containing 10 quadrats; quadrats subdivided into 16 cells for abundance (1991–2013) visualization.
- Abundance estimation: proportionate to the number of cells in which a species occurs (1991–2013); in 2014, abundance expressed as percentage cover.
- Recording protocol: 1987–1989 field sheets not available; 1994 and 2000 data include numerous inconsistencies and pseudospecies notes.
- Documentation and keys: field recording schemes and cell maps described (Figure 2 describes quadrat subdivision; Figure 1 shows quadrat positions).

## Corrections, assumptions, and notes
- 1987–1989: data inferred from a published table (no field sheets).
- 1994–2000: multiple discrepancies between field sheets and summaries; corrections applied where possible; some taxa treated as pseudospecies or identified to genus.
- Taxonomic updates and nomenclature changes (e.g., Lotus uliginosus → L. pedunculatus; Tragopogon forms; various bryophyte pseudospecies).
- Data cleaning: several entries replaced (e.g., non-numeric symbols like + or ticks replaced with "p" for very small presence); some quadrats excluded due to ambiguous identifications.
- 2014: fungal species not included in the database; some habitat misidentifications corrected (e.g., Equisetum palustre vs. E. pratense).
