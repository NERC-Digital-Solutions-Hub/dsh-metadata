# Somerfordmethods.docx

- This document details the results and metadata of a grazing experiment conducted in Somerford Mead, a restored floodplain meadow on the River Thames upstream of Oxford, spanning 1987–2014.

## Purpose, scope and context
- Aimed at understanding ecological succession and the effects of different grazing regimes (cattle, sheep, or none) on plant communities.
- Data intended for monitoring environmental health and informing restoration and management decisions.

## Site, experimental design and sampling
- Location: Somerford Mead floodplain meadow; plots established in a 10 m x 10 m stand with 1 m x 1 m quadrats.
- Experimental design: 9 plots total, arranged as three grazing treatments (Cattle, Sheep, No grazing) replicated three times.
- Plot infrastructure: Each plot marked with steel scaffolding poles at the center; plots mapped with NGR coordinates (Table 1).
- Sampling: Within each plot, ten quadrats were assessed (total of 90 quadrats). Quadrats were recorded in a fixed order (numerical) for consistency.
- Data collection timing: Baseline data (1987–1989) before treatments; treatment response data (1991–2013, excluding 2000); final survey (2014) by UKCEH.
- Data collection team: Lead investigator Dr Alison McDonald and student assistants (often from Wageningen University, NL).

## Data collected, structure and formats
- Core data: Species-by-quadrat abundance matrices; rows = quadrats; columns = species names; cells = abundance for that species in that quadrat; absent species left blank.
- File formats by time period:
  - 1987–1989 (Baseline): abundance as the number of 16 subcells within a quadrat in which the species occurred (scale 1–16).
  - 1991–2013 (Treatment response, excluding 2000): same 16-subcell abundance scale (1–16).
  - 2014 (Final survey): abundance as estimated ground area percentage covered by each species (scale 1–100); final column shows the total number of species per quadrat.
- Final data structure: A table per file where column headers are species, rows are quadrats (first column contains quadrat identifiers), blanks indicate absence, and a final column provides per-quadrat species richness.
- Details on measurements: For 1991–2013, abundance reflects presence in 16 equal cells within each 1 m x 1 m quadrat; for 2014, abundance reflects percent ground cover.
- Metadata and provenance: Raw field proformas originally recorded in the field; field sheets and proformas held by Floodplain Meadows Partnership; digitization occurred in 2022.

## Taxonomy, quality control and data cleaning
- Taxonomic standardization: Names updated in 2022 to reflect Stace's New Flora of the British Isles (4th ed., 2019) to resolve synonyms.
- Data validation: Species counts per quadrat checked by Dr M.J. Stone; arithmetic corrections applied as needed.
- Data provenance checks: Raw data collected by multiple recorders but annually quality assured by Dr A. McDonald (1987–2013) and J.O. Mountford (2014).
- Management of uncertainty: Pseudospecies and uncertain IDs noted (e.g., bryophytes, genus-level identifications); some entries replaced or annotated to indicate uncertainty.
- Species notes and nomenclature changes: Examples include reassignments and renaming (e.g., Lotus uliginosus → L. pedunculatus; Tragopogon forms; Equisetum identifications).
- Missing and correction details: Several years contain corrections for miscopying, mismatches between field sheets and summaries, and handling of "+" or tick marks as very small presence (<1%).

## Data corrections, issues and notes
- 1987–1989: No field data sheets available; data sourced from a separate document/table.
- 1994–1999: Mismatches and handwritten vs. printed summaries; field-data checks conducted; discrepancies resolved where possible.
- 2000: Very limited or no additional data; certain inconsistencies noted and handled.
- 2001–2013: Numerous corrections for species counts, pseudospecies, and identifications; some entries consolidated (e.g., multiple entries for the same species in a quadrat).
- General caution: Some entries represent uncertain identifications or coarse identifications (genus-only) and some data have been replaced with placeholders (e.g., "p" for very small presence).

## Data governance, sharing and use for monitoring
- Data handling: Emphasis on data quality assurance, transparent provenance, and the need to share underlying data where appropriate.
- Data sharing constraints: Publicly sharing certain datasets can be a barrier; metadata completeness and clear data governance are essential to facilitate reuse.
- Data management: Metadata creation and updates aligned with organizational standards; data are stored with supporting documentation (e.g., field sheets, proformas).
- Relevance to monitoring frameworks: Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle for ecological monitoring—from field collection and QA to data cleaning, standardization, and dissemination, with attention to metadata, data versioning, and handling of data gaps and inconsistencies.
