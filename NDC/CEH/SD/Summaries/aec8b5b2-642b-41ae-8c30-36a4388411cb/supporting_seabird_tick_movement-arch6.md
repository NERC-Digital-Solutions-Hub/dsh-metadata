# Data Collection

## Field Site and Aim
- NERC-funded PhD project investigating interactions between avian colonial social structure and tick-borne pathogen dynamics.
- Field site: Isle of May, Firth of Forth, Scotland (56.2° N, 2.6° W) chosen for its large, accessible population of common guillemots.
- Aim: quantify movements of host-seeking seabird ticks to understand infection risk with Great Island virus for the guillemot host.

## Experimental Setup and Timing
- Laboratory experiments conducted at controlled conditions: 20 °C and 70% relative humidity.
- Nymphs tested: 19 July–8 August 2013.
- Adult females tested: 4–11 April 2014.
- Sample size: 24 adult female ticks and 24 nymphal ticks (I. uriae) collected on 25–27 March 2014 and 18 July 2013, respectively.
- Post-collection handling: ticks stored in a moist, dark environment for no more than four weeks before testing.

## Tick Collection and Handling
- Ticks tested individually.
- Nymphs collected from boiler suits worn by field workers; adult females collected from cracks in rock faces.
- Each tick placed in an arena for testing and then returned to moist tubes between tests.

## Arena Protocol and Kairomone Control
- Arena setup: single A1 piece of paper as the floor; 30 cm high white cardboard walls.
- Start positions and subsequent tick positions recorded at each interval.
- To minimize kairomone effects from previous ticks, the arena floor paper was replaced before each tick was introduced.
- Acclimation: ticks allowed to acclimate to the arena for 1 minute before recording began.

## Data Recording and Identity
- Timekeeping and trial structure:
  - Ticks tested sequentially (Trial).
  - Start from the initial position; record positions at defined intervals.
- Recording intervals:
  - Nymphs: 2-minute intervals, total recording time 10 minutes.
  - Adult females: 1-minute intervals, total recording time 5 minutes.
- Handling between tests: ticks returned to moist tubes between trials.

## Data Structure
- Tick_ID: Unique identifier for each tick.
- Date_norm: Number of days from the first date of data collection.
- Trial: Sequence number of the tick’s test.
- Dec_time: Decimalized time of day.
- Total displacement: Straight-line distance from starting point to finishing point (cm).
- Distanced_movedx: Straight-line distance moved in interval x (cm).
- Life_stage: Life stage of the tick (nymph or adult female).
