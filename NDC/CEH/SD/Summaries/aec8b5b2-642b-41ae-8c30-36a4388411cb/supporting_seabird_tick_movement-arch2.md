# Data Collection

## Context and Aim
- NERC-funded PhD project examining how avian colonial social structure influences tick-borne pathogen dynamics.
- Isle of May, Scotland, chosen for its large, accessible common guillemot population.
- Primary aim: quantify movements of the host-seeking seabird tick (Ixodes uriae) to assess Great Island virus infection risk for guillemots.

## Field Site and Specimens
- Field site: Isle of May, Firth of Forth, Scotland (56.2° N, 2.6° W).
- Ticks collected:
  - 24 adult female Ixodes uriae (collected 25–27 March 2014).
  - 24 nymphal Ixodes uriae (collected 18 July 2013).
- Collection methods:
  - Nymphs gathered from boiler suits worn by field workers.
  - Adult females taken from cracks in rock faces.
- Storage prior to testing: moist, dark environment for up to four weeks.

## Laboratory Experiments and Protocol
- Timing:
  - Nymphs tested July 19–August 8, 2013.
  - Adult females tested April 4–11, 2014.
- Conditions: constant temperature 20 °C and 70% relative humidity.
- Testing arena: single A1 sheet of paper as floor; 30 cm high white cardboard walls.
- Individual testing: each tick tested separately.
- Position recording: tick position marked at the start and at each subsequent time interval.
- Time intervals and totals:
  - Nymphs: recording every 2 minutes, total duration 10 minutes.
  - Adult females: recording every 1 minute, total duration 5 minutes.
- Experimental controls:
  - Paper liner replaced between ticks to prevent kairomone buildup.
  - Ticks tested sequentially but returned to moist tubes between tests.
  - 1-minute acclimation period in arena before recording.

## Data Recording and Management
- Data collection focuses on movement metrics and timing to quantify host-seeking behavior.
- Key data captured for each tick:
  - Tick_ID: Unique identifier for each tick.
  - Date_norm: Days from the first date of data collection.
  - Trial: Sequential testing order of ticks.
  - Dec_time: Decimalized time of day for each observation.
  - Total displacement: Straight-line distance from starting to finishing point (cm).
  - Distanced_movedx: Straight-line distance moved in interval x (cm).
  - Life_stage: Nymph or adult female.

## Data Structure Summary
- Structured to support standardized, comparable movement analysis across ticks and life stages.
- Facilitates integration with broader environmental monitoring outputs and reporting on vector–host dynamics.
