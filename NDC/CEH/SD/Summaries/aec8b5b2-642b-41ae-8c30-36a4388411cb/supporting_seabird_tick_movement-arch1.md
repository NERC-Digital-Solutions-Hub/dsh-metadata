# Data Collection

- Context and aim
  - Part of a NERC-funded PhD project examining interactions between avian colonial social structure and tick-borne pathogen dynamics.
  - Study site: Isle of May, Firth of Forth, Scotland; focus on the common guillemot as model species.
  - Objective: quantify movements of host-seeking seabird tick (Ixodes uriae) to understand risk of Great Island virus transmission to guillemot hosts.

- Field site and specimens
  - Field collection dates: 25–27 March 2014 for adult females; 18 July 2013 for nymphs.
  - Sample sizes: 24 adult female ticks and 24 nymphal ticks.
  - Tick sources: adult females from rock cracks; nymphs from field workers’ boiler suits.
  - Storage: kept in a moist, dark environment for up to four weeks before testing.

- Laboratory and experimental setup
  - Arena: single A1 sheet of paper as floor with 30 cm high white cardboard walls.
  - Movement recording: tick positions marked at specified intervals; arena floor replaced between tests to avoid kairomone buildup.
  - Test sequencing: ticks tested sequentially; returned to moist tubes between tests; acclimatization period of 1 minute prior to recording.

- Testing protocol by life stage
  - Nymphs: recording interval of 2 minutes, total test time of 10 minutes.
  - Adult females: recording interval of 1 minute, total test time of 5 minutes.

- Data collection and timing
  - Each tick tested individually.
  - Time intervals and total durations selected to capture movement behavior under controlled conditions.

- Data structure and variables
  - Tick_ID: unique identifier for each tick.
  - Date_norm: days from the first date of data collection.
  - Trial: order of ticks tested in sequence.
  - Dec_time: decimalized time of day.
  - Total displacement: straight-line distance from start to finish (cm).
  - Distanced_movedx: straight-line distance moved within interval x (cm).
  - Life_stage: nymph or adult female.
