# The dataset

- Overview
  - A dataset of calculated breeding success rates (BS) for six seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies.
  - Yearly rows; six columns for breeding success rates by species and six columns for the number of active nests used to calculate BS.
  - Species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake, northern fulmar.
  - Years: BS calculated since 1982 (puffin, guillemot, razorbill) and since 1987 (shag, kittiwake, fulmar).
  - Free to use under a standard CEH data licence; researchers encouraged to contact CEH staff before publication.

- Data contents
  - Each row represents a year.
  - Six BS values (one per species) and six corresponding active-nest counts.
  - Data intended to support analysis of seabird productivity over time.

- Background and context
  - Isle of May NNR seabird studies (IMLOTS) part of JNCC’s national seabird monitoring.
  - Monitoring methods standardized from 1987; long-term, field-validated procedures.
  - Field work conducted by trained CEH staff; data recorded in notebooks and field sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets.
  - Data quality controlled at the source; references to archived notebooks and fieldsheets at CEH Edinburgh.

- Field measurements and data handling
  - Data entry into spreadsheets with verification checks; inconsistencies cross-checked in the field.
  - Data stored in Access databases with error-checking queries.
  - All data and outputs subject to CEH management vetting and tracking; staff encouraged to publish non-confidential results with customer approval.
  - Data are archived and accessible per CEH data governance.

- Output and usage
  - Outputs designed to enable self-service analysis (dashboards, pivot tables, reports) and to support broader data use.
  - Outputs include guidance on using data products; outputs may be shared in early prototypes for feedback.
  - Emphasis on data provenance, quality, and alignment with contracted deliverables.

- Appendix: productivity monitoring methods by species (high-level)
  - Fulmar
    - Plot-based nest-site mapping; use multiple plots (preferably 3–5) covering 30–50 nest-sites each.
    - Annual checks from late May/early June; record nesting activity and chick presence across three checks.
    - Productivity expressed as mean fledged young per regularly occupied site; colony production = total fledged divided by incubating nests.
  - Shag
    - Visits every 7–10 days from egg-laying to fledging; aim for 3–5 study plots (10–30 nests each).
    - Same plots used annually; photographs and overlays mark nest positions.
    - Productivity = total fledged young divided by nests where birds were incubating.
  - Kittiwake
    - 50–100 nests per plot; photograph nests in May; overlay with plot boundaries.
    - Visits in late May and mid-June to record incubating, attended, and recent nest statuses.
    - Second and later visits re-check nests; fledging assessed after first chick is seen across plots.
    - Productivity = fledged chicks divided by completed nests.
  - Guillemot
    - Several plots with 50+ breeding pairs; frequent visits from incubation start (mid-April).
    - Record eggs laid, lost, relaid, hatched; identify active/inactive but regular sites.
    - Fledging inferred from age (≥15 days) and disappearance data; productivity = fledged divided by active sites.
  - Razorbill
    - Similar to guillemot: multiple plots (5 plots; at least 10 breeding pairs each).
    - Photograph during incubation; record nest states and chick presence; frequent checks (≥3 per day when possible).
    - Productivity = fledged divided by active sites.
  - Puffin
    - Post-peak laying burrow checks; four plots of 50+ burrows.
    - Use probes to detect incubating birds; re-check in early July to confirm chick presence.
    - Success expressed as number of chicks present divided by burrows where presence/absence of a chick was determined.
