# The dataset:

## Overview
- A long-term dataset of calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species from Isle of May, off the East coast of Scotland.
- Breeding success defined as the number of chicks fledged per active nest.
- Species and start years:
  - Atlantic puffin (1982)
  - Common guillemot (1982)
  - Razorbill (1982)
  - European shag (1987)
  - Black-legged kittiwake (1987)
  - Northern fulmar (1987)
- Each year is a single row; six columns contain breeding success (BS) rates, and six columns contain the number of active nests used to calculate BS.
- Dataset is free to use under a standard CEH data licence; researchers are encouraged to contact CEH staff before publication.

## Content and structure
- Six species BS values (by common name, suffix BS) and six corresponding active nest counts per year.
- Time span spans from 1982 onward for the first three species and from 1987 onward for the latter three.

## Temporal and spatial scope
- Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR), representative colonies for seabird monitoring.
- Part of the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) seabird monitoring programme.
- Monitoring methods standardized since 1987; data establish a consistent, time-series record.

## Methods and sampling design
- Field methods and data handling are described in an Appendix; the documented methods have been consistent since standardisation in 1987.
- General approach:
  - Trained staff collect field data using defined protocols.
  - Data recorded in notebooks and field sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets.
  - Cross-checks conducted for inconsistencies (e.g., hatchings, fledging dates) and field verification performed for potential errors.
- Species-specific monitoring (summaries from Appendix):
  - Fulmar: nest-site mapping on plots; multiple plots per colony; three or more plots preferred; annual plotting; photograph plots; mark nest sites; late-season checks; productivity as mean fledged per occupied site.
  - Shag: visits every 7–10 days; sampling plots when colonies are large; plot sizes around 10–30 nests; yearly use of the same plots; record nest state and incubation/brooding status; productivity as fledged per incubating nest.
  - Kittiwake: plots of 50–100 nests; photography of plots; multiple visits; mark incubating nests and other attended nests; census fledging after first chick appears; productivity as fledged per completed nest.
  - Guillemot: multiple study plots (minimum five of ~50 breeding pairs); early-season incubation photographs; mark active sites; several daily checks; record eggs, losses, relaid, hatch, and chick presence; productivity as fledged per active site.
  - Razorbill and Puffin: similar plot-based, repeat-visit methodologies with emphasis on incubation detection, chick development, and final fledging; puffin uses burrow checks with stakes and later checks around July to confirm presence of chicks; productivity as fledged per active/regular site (puffin uses burrow-based counts; other species rely on nest/site counts).
- Data quality controls:
  - All databases quality controlled at source; Access databases include error-checking queries.
  - Data backed up to CEH directories; notebooks and fieldsheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.

## Data quality and management
- Outputs and dataset integrity subjected to management vetting and tracking within CEH (Heads of Sections, Programme Directors, Finance Administration).
- Encouraged dissemination of non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgment.
- Emphasis on replicability through standardized methods, year-to-year plot consistency, and explicit sampling designs.

## Output and usage
- Primary outputs include structured breeding success values and corresponding nest counts suitable for temporal trend analyses, comparative assessments across species, and policy/management monitoring.
- Outputs are suitable for reports, maps, and charts that align with environmental monitoring and policy performance evaluation.

## Access, licensing, and publication
- Free-to-use dataset under CEH data license.
- Authors encourage potential users, especially for publication, to contact CEH staff prior to use.

## Appendix and method references
- Appendix extracts from user manuals detail species-specific productivity-monitoring methods (fulmar, shag, kittiwake, guillemot, razorbill, puffin).
- Methods emphasize plot selection, photographic mapping, sequential checks across critical breeding periods, careful handling to avoid disturbance, and explicit formulas for calculating colony productivity (e.g., fledged young per occupied/active nest or per completed nest).

## Historical context
- Seabird monitoring at Isle of May began in 1973 (IMLOTS), as part of a national seabird monitoring framework.
- Standardised methods implemented from 1987, ensuring comparability across years and species.
- Data collection and management reflect a long-term commitment to environmental monitoring and policy-relevant assessment of seabird breeding success.
