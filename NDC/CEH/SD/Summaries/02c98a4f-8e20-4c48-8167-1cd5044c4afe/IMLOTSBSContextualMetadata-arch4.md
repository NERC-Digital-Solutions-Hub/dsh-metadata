# The dataset:

- Content: A dataset of calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies off the East coast of Scotland. Each year is a single row with twelve data columns: six columns for breeding success rates (one per species, indicated by common name and suffixed 'BS') and six columns for the number of active nests used to calculate those rates.
- Species included: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake, northern fulmar.
- Timeframe: Puffin, guillemot, and razorbill data begin in 1982; shag, kittiwake, and fulmar data begin in 1987.

- Access and licensing: Dataset is free to use under a standard CEH data licence. Authors encourage contacting CEH staff before publication, especially for publications.

- Context and provenance: Collected as part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), linked to the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) seabird monitoring programme. Breeding success calculation methods have been consistent since 1987 and are described in the Appendix.

- Data collection and handling: Fieldwork conducted by trained staff following defined protocols. Data captured in field notebooks and data sheets, transcribed to spreadsheets, and backed up to CEH directories. Consistency checks performed against known hatching/fledging dates and field verifications performed as needed. Notebooks and field sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.

- Data quality and governance: Databases used are quality-controlled at source with error-checking queries in Access to validate information and correct errors. Data integrity, reporting quality, and alignment with contracted deliverables are vettted within CEH by management layers. Publication of non-confidential scientific information is encouraged with customer approval.

- Data products and usage: The dataset supports lineage to long-term seabird monitoring efforts and is intended for integration into broader analyses, policy discussions, and collaborative data practices. It emphasizes discoverability and ongoing updates within a managed data system.

- Appendix and methods overview: The document includes extracts from user manuals detailing species-specific productivity-monitoring methods (Fulmar, Shag, Kittiwake, Guillemot, Razorbill, Puffin). These describe plot selection, sampling strategies, plotting and marking nests, regular visits, age/sex considerations, and how productivity is calculated for each species. The methods provide context for how the breeding success data were generated and how future data should be collected to maintain comparability.
