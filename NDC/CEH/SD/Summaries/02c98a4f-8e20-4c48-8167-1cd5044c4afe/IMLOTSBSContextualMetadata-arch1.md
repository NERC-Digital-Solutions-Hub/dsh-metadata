# The dataset:

- A long-term dataset of calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species at Isle of May, Scotland.
- Species: Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica), common guillemot (Uria aalge), razorbill (Alca torda), European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), and northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis).
- Temporal coverage: data collected since 1982 for puffin, guillemot, and razorbill; 1987 for shag, kittiwake, and fulmar.
- Data structure: each year is a single row; six columns contain the calculated breeding success (BS) for each species, and six columns contain the number of active nests used to calculate BS.
- Licensing and use: dataset is free to use under a CEH data licence; authors encourage contacting CEH staff before publication or large-scale use.

## Overview of data content

- Breeding success defined as chicks fledged per active nest for each species.
- The six active-nest counts corresponding to the six BS columns accompany the six BS columns.
- Dataset sits within the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), part of the UK JNCC seabird monitoring program.
- Methods for calculating breeding success have been consistent since 1987 and are described in the appendix of the accompanying document.

## Provenance and background

- Seabird monitoring at Isle of May NNR initiated in 1973 (Mike Harris) as part of IMLOTS.
- Standardised monitoring adopted from 1987 across species.
- Detailed sampling frameworks developed for each species, with field protocols maintained and archived at CEH Edinburgh.

## Field measurements and data handling

- Fieldwork performed by trained staff following defined protocols.
- Data collection in notebooks and field data sheets; transcribed to spreadsheets; consistency checks performed against field records.
- Inconsistencies checked in the field; notebooks and data sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Data quality control at source via Access database error-checking queries.

## Databases, quality control, and dissemination

- Quality-controlled databases; error-checking queries help verify uncertain information at the field station.
- Management vetting and tracking of data integrity, reporting timelines, and deliverables within CEH.
- Encouragement for staff to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed journals, with customer approval and acknowledgment.
- Data and methods are accompanied by appendices describing measurement procedures.

## Appendices: productivity-monitoring methods (species-specific)

- The appendices extract field methods used to obtain the dataset, including plot selection, sampling intensity, and productivity calculations.
- Key elements shared across species:
  - Use of plots or sample areas to represent colonies; random or dispersed plot selection when colonies are large.
  - Standardized photographic documentation of plots, nest sites, and counts (large prints with overlays).
  - Repeated visits during breeding periods to track nest status, contents, and incubation/fledging states.
  - Calculation of colony productivity as the number of fledged chicks divided by the number of nests sampled or completed, depending on species.
  - Emphasis on avoiding disturbance, careful matching of nest sites across dates, and handling of late-bound or moving chicks.

- Puffin productivity-monitoring method (from Walsh, Puffin 7):
  - Post-peak laying checks of burrows; four plots of 50+ burrows; use probing sticks to detect incubation.
  - Re-checks when large chicks are present; determine success via chick presence or evidence of fledging; exclude untraceable burrows from calculations.

- Fulmar productivity-monitoring method (from Walsh, Fulmar 3):
  - Nest-site mapping from photographs; 30–50 nest-sites per plot; multiple plots (3–5+ recommended).
  - Regular visits (late May/early June to mid-August) to assess incubation, brooding, and chick development.
  - Express colony production as total fledged young per occupied site.

- Shag productivity-monitoring method (from Walsh, Shag 3):
  - 7–10 day visits from onset of laying to fledging; aim to sample multiple plots (3–5+), each with 10–30 nests.
  - Use photographs with overlays; record nest state and incubation/brooding status; estimate fledging based on chick presence and development.

- Kittiwake productivity-monitoring method (from Walsh, Kittiwake 3):
  - Identify 50–100 nests across plots; photograph plots for several years.
  - Visit in late May and mid-June; mark nests with incubating birds, attended nests, and other nest indicators.
  - After first chick is seen, record fledging as winged young; compute productivity as fledged chicks per completed nests.

- Guillemot productivity-monitoring method (from Walsh, Guillemot 4):
  - Randomly select several study plots (5 plots, each with at least 50 breeding pairs).
  - Use incubating-period photographs to map active sites; multiple daily visits (≥3) to trackEggs laid, lost, relaid, hatched, and young fledged.
  - Productivity defined as total active sites (egg or chick or incubating adult on two consecutive checks) divided by total sampled sites.

## Licensing and access

- Dataset is freely available under CEH data licensing; prior contact is encouraged for publication or use in research.
