# The dataset

- A dataset of calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies (off East Scotland): Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake, and northern fulmar.
- Annual breeding success equals chicks fledged per active nest; each year is a single row with six species columns suffixed "BS" and six columns for the number of active nests used to calculate the rates.
- Open for use under a CEH data licence; authors encourage contacting CEH staff before publication.

## Context and background

- Part of long-term seabird monitoring linked to Isle of May NNR, IMLOTS, and the UK JNCC seabird monitoring programme.
- Breeding success calculation methods standardized since 1987; field methods documented in appendices.
- Detailed species histories and plot deployment numbers describe how sampling bands have evolved with each population fluctuation.

## Field measurements and data handling

- Fieldwork conducted by trained staff following defined protocols; data collected in notebooks and field data sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets with checks for inconsistencies.
- Field checks are used to verify data accuracy; notebooks and data sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Data entered and quality-checked within source databases using error-checking queries; ongoing data integrity is prioritized.

## Databases, quality control, and provenance

- Databases used are quality controlled at source; error-checking mechanisms validate uncertain information in the field and allow corrections.
- Output and reporting are vetting and tracked by CEH management channels; publication of non-confidential scientific information is encouraged with customer approval and acknowledgement.

## Output, licensing, and access

- Results and reports are produced to contract deliverables and are subject to management vetting.
- The dataset is available under a CEH data licence; users are encouraged to contact CEH staff prior to use, especially for publications.

## Methods by species (productivity-monitoring approaches)

- Fulmar productivity-monitoring (nest-site mapping):
  - Map plots using photographs; use 30–50 nest-sites per plot, with multiple plots (3–5+) when possible.
  - Use consistent plots year to year and photograph plots for overlay mapping; carefully check nest-site locations and adjustments across dates.
  - Record nest states, contents, and incubation/brooding status across three late-season checks; compute colony production as fledged young over incubating nests.

- Shag productivity-monitoring:
  - Use random or stratified sampling of plots (10–30 nests per plot; 3–5 plots recommended); photographs of plots.
  - Visit every 7–10 days from mid-April; record nest state, contents, and incubation/brooding status.
  - Compute production as fledged young per incubating nest.

- Guillemot productivity-monitoring:
  - Select several plots (≥5) with ≥50 breeding pairs each; use incubation-period photos to delimit active sites.
  - Conduct multiple visits per day during incubation; track eggs, losses, relays, hatches, and chicks without adults.
  - Productivity is total fledged chicks divided by active sites (egg or chick or incubating on consecutive checks).

- Kittiwake productivity-monitoring:
  - Identify 50–100 nest plots viewable with minimal disturbance; photograph plots during May.
  - Mark nests with incubating birds, attended nests, and any nest traces on overlays; re-check on subsequent visits.
  - After first chick is seen, record chick numbers by age category; calculate productivity as fledged chicks per completed nest.

- Razorbill productivity-monitoring:
  - Similar approach to Guillemot: select plots with ≥10 breeding pairs; photograph during incubation; mark active sites.
  - Multiple daily visits to record incubation, nest state, and chick development; productivity is fledged chicks per active site.

- Puffin productivity-monitoring:
  - Check burrows after peak laying (early May); mark four plots of 50+ burrows each.
  - Use probing sticks to detect incubating birds without disturbing eggs; re-check when chicks are large (early July) to determine success.
  - Productivity expressed as chicks present divided by burrows where presence/absence of a chick was determined.

## Data governance considerations for Data Stewards

- Ensure alignment with long-term, standardized data collection protocols across species to maintain interoperability and comparability.
- Maintain detailed metadata for plots, sampling units, dates, observers, and field conditions to support reproducibility and audit trails.
- Manage data quality through source-level validation, error-checking routines, and version-controlled archives of notebooks, sheets, and databases.
- Monitor and document licensing, access rights, embargoes, and publication approvals; coordinate updates to datasets as new monitoring cycles complete.
- Facilitate data discoverability by uploading and cataloguing datasets in appropriate portals with consistent schema and descriptive metadata.
