# The dataset:

- Content and scope
  - A dataset of calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species at representative Isle of May colonies (East coast of Scotland).
  - Annual breeding success is measured as chicks fledged per active nest.
  - Species and start years: Atlantic puffin (since 1982), common guillemot (since 1982), razorbill (since 1982), European shag (since 1987), black-legged kittiwake (since 1987), northern fulmar (since 1987).
  - Year rows include six breeding success rate columns (BS) and six corresponding active nest counts.
  - The dataset is free to use under a CEH data licence; authors request contact with CEH staff prior to publication.

- Context and purpose
  - Linked to the Isle of May NNR seabird programme, part of the UK JNCC national seabird monitoring programme.
  - Methods for calculating breeding success are documented in an Appendix and have been consistent since standardisation in 1987.
  - Serves as a monitoring output to evaluate environmental health, inform policy, and guide future decisions.

- Field measurements, data handling, and quality
  - Fieldwork conducted by trained staff following defined protocols; data captured in notebooks and field data sheets.
  - Data transcribed to spreadsheets, checked for inconsistencies (e.g., hatching/fledging dates), and field-verified as needed.
  - All notebooks and data sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases are quality-controlled at source; Access databases include built-in error checking.

- Data management and governance
  - Outputs vetted and tracked for integrity, alignment with contracted deliverables, and timeliness by CEH management.
  - CEH staff encouraged to publish non-confidential results in peer-reviewed literature, with customer approval and acknowledgement.
  - Data licensing and sharing considerations noted; researchers are advised to contact CEH before publication.

- Appendix: monitoring methods (excerpts from User Manuals)
  - Fulmar productivity-monitoring (nest-site mapping)
    - Plot sizes: 30–50 nest-sites; ≥3 plots (preferably 5+); same plots used yearly.
    - Photo plots with overlays; careful matching of nest-sites across dates.
    - Three visits in late May/early June to assess incubation; August checks for chick presence.
    - Output: colony productivity as mean fledged per regularly occupied site; overall productivity as chicks fledged divided by nests where incubation occurred.
  - Shag productivity-monitoring
    - Sampling: identify and select 3–5 study plots (10–30 nests per plot); same plots yearly.
    - Regular visits (7–10 day intervals) from mid-late April; record nest state and incubation/brooding presence.
    - Output: colony productivity as total fledged chicks divided by nests where birds were definitely/probably incubating.
  - Kittiwake productivity-monitoring
    - Plots: 50–100 nests (2–3 plots per colony, dispersed); capture photos for several years.
    - Visits in late May and mid-June; mark nests with evidence of incubation, attendance, or absence.
    - Second/subsequent visits re-check nest contents; after first chick is seen, record fledging numbers.
    - Output: productivity as chicks fledged divided by completed nests.
  - Guillemot productivity-monitoring
    - Study plots: multiple plots (5 plots, ≥50 breeding pairs each); photograph and map active sites.
    - Frequent visits from incubation onwards; record egg laying, loss, relaid, hatching, and chick presence.
    - Output: productivity based on active sites and regular sites; use 15-day rule to infer fledging when chick age varies.
  - Puffin productivity-monitoring
    - Burrow checks after peak laying; 4 plots of 50+ burrows.
    - Probing method to detect incubation; re-check in July to determine success via chick presence or other evidence.
    - Output: productivity as chicks present divided by total burrows where presence/absence of a chick was determined.

- Relevance for monitoring-framework authors
  - Demonstrates a long-term, standardized data collection framework with clearly defined sampling designs, plot management, and repeatability.
  - Emphasizes data provenance, metadata sufficiency (plots, nest-site mapping, photo overlays), and transparency in methods.
  - Illustrates data quality assurance, governance, and publication workflows, including openness versus confidentiality constraints and data-sharing considerations.
