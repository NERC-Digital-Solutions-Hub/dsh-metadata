# Human impact on long-term organic carbon export to rivers

## Overview
- Time span and data: Monthly dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations for the Thames River (1883–2014); water colour data (1883–1990) and DOC (1990–2014). DOC prior to 1990 estimated by calibration with colour data (1899–1905) when OC measurements were available.
- Study area: Thames basin upstream of London, 9948 km2, temperate, mineral-soil–dominated catchment. Upstream gauged data collected at Hampton and Teddington; data reflect a large urban population and extensive wastewater infrastructure.
- Trend and data products: Fluvial DOC concentration shows an upward trend over the period. Data are presented as one main table plus one supporting metadata file.

## Study site and collection
- Location and scale: River Thames basin upstream of London; second-longest UK river (354 km) with major urban centres and numerous sewage treatment works (STWs).
- Population and infrastructure: High human population density (~960 people km−2); 36 largest STWs with tertiary treatment installed upstream of the tidal limit since 2003 (serving ~2.7 million people).
- Land use and geology: Predominantly rural upstream (87.7% in 2007); underlain by Cretaceous Chalk with limestone, mudstones, sandstones, and Oxford clay.
- Sampling points: At Thames at Hampton (colour) and Teddington (DOC).

## Measurement methods for DOC and colour
- Historical methods (1883–1974): Burgess method using a colour comparison in potassium dichromate/cobalt sulphate solution; results expressed in Burgess units.
- Intermediate method (1974–1990): Hazen colour units measured with absorptiometer (Hazen units correlate with Burgess units).
- Modern era (1990–2014): DOC measured directly; data collected under the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme (HMS).
- Data availability: 1974 onward data accessible via data.gov.uk; specific HMS data coverage documented.
- Calibration between colour and DOC: DOC = 0.0955 × Colour + 0.2103 (R² = 0.66, n = 194). This calibration allowed estimation of DOC from colour data (1883–1990).
- Stationarity caveat: Worrall and Burt (2010) showed DOC–colour relationships have shifted over periods since 1974; the study checked estimates against independent DOC data (1883–1905 from Grand Junction Water Company; 1990–1998 Thames Water; 1998–2014 EA) and found consistency.

## Data provenance
- Time- and source-specific metadata:
  - 1883–1905: Colour; Burgess measurement; Grand Junction Water Company; daily sampling.
  - 1905–1974: Colour; Burgess method; London Metropolitan Water Board; sampling frequency varied (daily to weekly).
  - 1974–1988: Colour; Hazen; Thames Water Authority; monthly.
  - 1974–1990: Colour; Hazen; Environment Agency; weekly to monthly.
  - 1990–1998: DOC; mg L−1; Thames Water; approximately monthly.
  - 1998–2014: DOC; mg L−1; Environment Agency; approximately monthly.
- Data integration: Multiple sources and agencies combined into a single time series with an accompanying metadata file.

## Data handling and interpretation
- Calibration usage: The colour-to-DOC calibration enabled reconstruction of a long-term DOC record where direct DOC measurements were unavailable.
- Validation: Estimated DOC (1883–1990) cross-checked against independent historical DOC data; overall consistency with later measurements supports the reconstruction.
- Uncertainties: Acknowledges potential non-stationarity in colour–DOC relationships over time and reliance on historical measurement methods with differing standards.

## Relevance for monitoring practice
- demonstrates the potential to extend long-term environmental monitoring histories by harmonizing and calibrating heterogeneous archives (colour and DOC data) across eras.
- highlights the importance of:
  - preserving metadata and provenance across datasets,
  - documenting measurement methods and calibration relationships,
  - assessing and communicating uncertainties when reconstructing long-term indicators,
  - using harmonised monitoring schemes to enable consistent longitudinal analyses.
