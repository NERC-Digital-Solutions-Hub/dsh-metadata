# Human impact on long-term organic carbon export to rivers

## Overview
- Presents monthly dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations for the Thames River (UK) from 1883 to 2014 (mg/L). Colour data cover 1883–1990; DOC data cover 1990–2014.
- DOC estimates for 1883–1905 were derived by calibrating colour measurements to DOC for 1899–1905 when OC measurements existed.
- The study area is the River Thames basin upstream of London, a temperate, lowland, mineral-soil-dominated catchment.
- The fluvial DOC concentration shows an upward trend over the study period.
- Data are provided as one main table plus a metadata-containing supporting file.

## Study site and data collection
- Location: Thames at Hampton (51.42°N, 0.37°W) and Teddington (51.43°N, 0.33°W), upstream of London.
- Catchment: 9,948 km² with a large urban population that has grown fourfold since the 1880s; many sewage treatment works (STWs) upstream of the tidal limit; tertiary treatment installed at 36 largest STWs since 2003.
- Land use: predominantly rural upstream (87.7% in 2007).
- Geology: largely Cretaceous Chalk with areas of limestone, mudstones, sandstones, and Oxford clay.

## Measurement techniques
- DOC data (1990–2014) derived from standard monitoring under the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme (HMS); earlier colour data (1883–1974) and subsequent methods vary historically.
- Colour data (1883–1974) obtained by Burgess method (tube colour comparison using potassium dichromate and cobalt sulphate).
- Colour measurements (1974–1990) reported in Hazen units, using absorptiometry; Hazen units closely correspond to ~2.2 Burgess units.
- DOC (1990–1998) and later (1998–2014) measured directly in mg/L.
- Data provenance documents the measuring bodies and sampling frequencies across periods (Grand Junction Water Company; London Metropolitan Water Board; Thames Water Authority; Environment Agency).

## Calibration of DOC and water colour
- Calibration conducted on weekly samples for water years 1899–1905.
- Calibration equation: DOC = 0.0955 × Colour + 0.2103, with R² = 0.66 (n = 194; p < 0.001).
- This calibration was used to estimate DOC from colour data for 1883–1990.
- The study acknowledges potential non-stationarity in the colour–DOC relationship across periods (Worrall & Burt 2010) but confirms consistency with independent DOC data from multiple sources for overlapping periods.

## Data provenance and timeline
- 1883–1905: Colour (Burgess method); measurement bodies include Grand Junction Water Company; daily/weekly sampling.
- 1905–1974: Colour (Burgess); London Metropolitan Water Board; sampling frequency transitions from daily to weekly.
- 1974–1988: Colour (HazEN units); Thames Water Authority; sampling frequency: monthly (1974–1990).
- 1974–1990: Colour (Hazen and Hazen-equivalent color units); Environment Agency; sampling mixed (weekly to monthly).
- 1990–1998: DOC; Thames Water; approximately monthly.
- 1998–2014: DOC; Environment Agency; approximately monthly.
- Data sources include data.gov.uk (historic UK water quality sampling harmonised monitoring scheme details).

## Key findings and implications for monitoring
- The Thames basin DOC concentration exhibits a long-term upward trend from 1883 to 2014.
- The combination of historical colour measurements (1883–1990) with modern DOC measurements (1990–2014) provides a continuous long-term dataset.
- The approach demonstrates how standardized monitoring frameworks (HMS) and careful calibration enable long-duration environmental datasets.
- The study highlights the importance of verifying data provenance, harmonizing units (Burgess, Hazen), and recognizing potential non-stationarities in proxy relationships when constructing long-term time series.

## Data availability and relevance for monitoring
- The long-term DOC dataset supports assessments of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Data are stored and, where possible, uploaded to established portals (e.g., data.gov.uk and HMS) to facilitate access for others.
- The work exemplifies increasing data value by linking historical proxy measurements with modern direct measurements and ensuring transparent data provenance for reuse.
