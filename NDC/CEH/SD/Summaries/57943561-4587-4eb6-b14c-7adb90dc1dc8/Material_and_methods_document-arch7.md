# Human impact on long-term organic carbon export to rivers

## Overview
- Presents monthly dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration data for the Thames River (UK) from 1883 to 2014 (mg/L).
- Colour data are available from 1883 to 1990; DOC data from 1990 to 2014; DOC prior to 1990 estimated via color-DOC calibration for 1899–1905 when OC measurements existed.
- Data are measured at the outlet of the Thames basin, upstream of London, in a 9,948 km² catchment.
- The Thames DOC concentration shows an upward trend over the study period.
- Data are provided as one table plus one supporting file containing metadata.

## Study site and collection
- Data collected by statutory authorities (1883–2014) at Thames at Hampton and Teddington (locations specified by coordinates).
- The Thames basin upstream of London covers 9,948 km²; it is temperate, lowland, and mineral-soil dominated.
- The basin includes major urban centers and extensive sewage treatment works (STWs), with tertiary treatment installed upstream of the tidal limit since 2003 (serving ~2.7 million people).
- Population density high in the basin; a large portion remains rural (87.7% land area in 2007).
- Geological substrate predominantly Cretaceous Chalk, with local limestone, mudstone, sandstone, and Oxford clay.

## Measurement techniques for DOC and colour
- 1883–1974: Water colour measured by Burgess method using a two-tube comparison (colour judged against a standard solution).
- 1974–1990: Colour reported in Hazen units, measured with absorptiometer equipment; Hazen units closely correspond to ~2.2 Burgess units.
- 1883–1905: Organic carbon estimated from oxygen uptake by KMnO4 and then carbon in the residue by a Frankland eudiometric method.
- 1990–2014: DOC measurements defined within the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme (HMS); data 1974–1990 available via data.gov.uk.

## Calibration of DOC and water colour
- Calibration between colour and DOC developed for weekly samples in 1899–1905: DOC = 0.0955 × Colour + 0.2103; R² = 0.66, n = 194; correlation p < 0.001.
- This calibration enables estimation of DOC from colour for 1883–1990.
- Assumption of a stationary color–DOC relationship over time; later work shows shifts in the UK since 1974, but the study validated estimates against independent DOC data (early period) and against DOC data from Thames Water (1990–1998) and the Environment Agency (1998–2014); concentrations from these sources were consistent.

## Data provenance
- 1883–1905: Color; Burgess units; measured by Grand Junction Water Company; daily sampling.
- 1905–1974: Color; Burgess units; measured by London Metropolitan Water Board; sampling frequency varied (daily to weekly).
- 1974–1988: Color; Hazen units; measured by Thames Water Authority; monthly sampling.
- 1974–1990: Color; Hazen units; data from Environment Agency; sampling frequency varied (weekly to monthly).
- 1990–1998: DOC; mg/L; measured by Thames Water; approximately monthly.
- 1998–2014: DOC; mg/L; measured by Environment Agency; approximately monthly.

## Data availability and notes for GIS use
- The dataset comprises one table and one metadata file; 1974–1990 colour and later DOC data are available via data.gov.uk.
- Spatial context: measurements at fixed river locations (Hampton and Teddington) within a defined catchment, enabling basin-scale spatial analyses when combined with other hydrological layers.
- Temporal scope supports long-term trend analysis of DOC concentrations in a large, urban-influenced catchment, with potential to assess links to land use, wastewater infrastructure, and hydrology.
