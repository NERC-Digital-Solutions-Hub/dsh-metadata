# Human impact on long-term organic carbon export to rivers

- The study compiles monthly dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations for the Thames River from 1883 to 2014, with color data from 1883–1990 and DOC data from 1990–2014. DOC before 1990 is estimated via calibration to color data from 1899–1905.
- Data are collected at the Thames basin outlet upstream of London in a 9,948 km2 temperate, lowland catchment dominated by mineral soils; the basin has a large urban population and extensive wastewater treatment infrastructure.
- The fluvial DOC concentration shows an upward trend over the entire study period.

## Study site and collection

- Location: Thames basin upstream of London (Hampton at 51.42°N, 0.37°W; Teddington at 51.43°N, 0.33°W).
- Catchment characteristics: urban centers (e.g., Oxford, Slough, Reading), high population density (~960 people km-2), 36 large sewage treatment works upstream of the tidal limit since 2003.
- Land use: predominantly rural upstream of London (87.7% in 2007); geology mainly Cretaceous Chalk with limestone, mudstones, sandstone, and Oxford clay.
- Measurement context: DOC measurements (1990–2014) come from statutory authorities; color data (1883–1990) come from historical records.

## Measurement techniques for DOC and colour

- Colour (1883–1974): Burgess method using a two-tube comparison to estimate color as a ratio, later related to Hazen units.
- Colour (1974–1990): Hazen units measured with absorptiometer (601 filter or 430 mμ).
- DOC (1905–1904 periods not aligned): initial OC/organic content inferred via eudiometric method; DOC (1990–2014) measured under the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme (HMS).
- Data sources span multiple organisations and time periods, with the color-to-DOC calibration aligning different measurement approaches.

## Calibration of DOC and water colour

- Calibration period: once-per-week samples for 1899–1905.
- Derived relationship: DOC = 0.0955 × Colour + 0.2103 (R2 = 0.66, n = 194).
- Used to estimate DOC from color data for 1883–1990; assumes a stationary DOC–color relationship over time, though later work indicates shifts since 1974.
- Independent cross-checks: calibration estimates compared with early-period data (Grand Junction Water Company) and with DOC data from Thames Water (1990–1998) and the Environment Agency (1998–2014); overall consistency found.

## Data provenance

- Time segments and variables by period:
  - 1883–1905: Color; Burgess units; Grand Junction Water Company; daily/weekly sampling.
  - 1905–1974: Color; Burgess; London Metropolitan Water Board; daily (1905–1952) then weekly (1953–1974).
  - 1974–1988: Color; Hazen; Thames Water Authority; monthly.
  - 1974–1990: Color; Hazen; Environment Agency; weekly (1974–1985) then monthly (1985–1990).
  - 1990–1998: DOC; mg L-1; Thames Water; approximately monthly.
  - 1998–2014: DOC; mg L-1; Environment Agency; approximately monthly.
- Data and metadata are provided in a single table and a supporting file; 1990–2014 DOC data are harmonised under HMS; earlier records come from diverse historical sources.

## Data sources and accessibility

- Data available from historical records and UK data portals, including data.gov.uk for harmonised monitoring data.
- Cross-referencing with multiple institutions (Grand Junction Water Company, Thames Water, Environment Agency) enhances dataset continuity.

## Key findings and implications

- Long-term upward trend in riverine DOC concentration in the Thames basin from 1883 to 2014.
- The integrated dataset combines historic color data and modern DOC measurements, enabling a continuous perspective on organic carbon export.
- Calibration approach enabled DOC estimation prior to routine DOC measurements, but relies on the assumption of a stationary DOC–color relationship, which may not hold across all periods.

## Limitations and caveats

- The DOC–color relationship has been shown to shift over time, particularly since 1974, which can affect early DOC estimates.
- Multiple measurement methods and units across time require careful harmonisation; potential methodological biases exist between Burgess, Hazen, and eudiometric approaches.
- The study emphasizes that the observed trends are contingent on cross-era calibrations and data integration from various sources.
