# Human impact on long-term organic carbon export to rivers

- Overview
  - Monthly dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration data for the Thames River (UK) from 1883 to 2014; water colour data available from 1883 to 1990, with DOC data from 1990 to 2014.
  - DOC before 1990 estimated from colour via calibration (1899–1905) when DOC measurements were available; data are reported at the Thames basin outlet upstream of London.
  - The Thames basin is 9948 km2 in a temperate, lowland, mineral-soil-dominated catchment; has a large urban population and extensive wastewater infrastructure.
  - DOC concentration shows an upward long-term trend over the study period.
  - Data are provided as one table plus a supporting metadata file.

- Study site and collection
  - Measurements at Thames sites Hampton (colour) and Teddington (DOC), coordinates approximately 51.42–51.43°N, 0.33–0.37°W.
  - The basin upstream of London includes major urban centers and sewage treatment works (STWs); tertiary treatment has been installed at the 36 largest STWs since 2003 upstream of the tidal limit.
  - Land cover is predominantly rural (about 87.7% in 2007); underlying geology is chiefly Cretaceous Chalk with limestone, mudstones, sandstones, and Oxford clay.

- Measurement techniques for DOC and colour
  - Colour data (1883–1974) were obtained using the Burgess method (tube comparison with potassium dichromate/cobalt sulphate), reported as a Burgess colour ratio.
  - 1974–1990 colour data were reported in Hazen units, measured with absorptiometer; Hazen units approximate 2.2 Burgess units.
  - DOC measurements (1883–1905) used a eudiometric method after acidification and permanganate oxidation.
  - 1990–2014 DOC data follow the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme (HMS); 1974–1990 data come from multiple agencies (e.g., Thames Water Authority, Environment Agency).
  - Data sources include Grand Junction Water Company, London Metropolitan Water Board, Environment Agency, and data.gov.uk (historic UK water-quality data).

- Calibration of DOC and water colour
  - Calibration using weekly samples for water years 1899–1905 yielded: DOC = 0.0955 × Colour + 0.2103, with R² = 0.66, n = 194; correlation p < 0.001.
  - This calibration enabled estimation of DOC from colour for 1883–1990; the study acknowledges potential non-stationarity of the DOC–colour relationship over time (noting shifts since 1974 as shown by Worrall & Burt, 2010).
  - Independent DOC data (1883–1905) from the Grand Junction Water Company and later data (1990–1998) from Thames Water and the EA supported the approach.

- Data provenance
  - 1883–1905: Colour; Burgess method; Grand Junction Water Company; daily sampling (with weekly measurements when applicable); units and terminology reflect early methods.
  - 1905–1974: Colour; Burgess method; London Metropolitan Water Board; sampling frequency transitions from daily (1905–1952) to weekly (1953–1974).
  - 1974–1988: Colour; Hazen units; Thames Water Authority; monthly sampling.
  - 1974–1990: Colour; Hazen units; Environment Agency; sampling frequency shifted from weekly to monthly across the period.
  - 1990–1998: DOC; mg/L; Thames Water; approximately monthly sampling.
  - 1998–2014: DOC; mg/L; Environment Agency; approximately monthly sampling.

- Data interpretation and limitations
  - Documented upward trend in riverine DOC over the record length.
  - Calibration relies on a stationary DOC–colour relationship, which may not hold across the entire period; shifts since 1974 suggest caution when extrapolating colour-derived DOC to earlier times.
  - Merging data across multiple measurement regimes (colour vs. DOC, Burgess vs. Hazen, HMS vs. older schemes) introduces potential inhomogeneities; provenance and metadata are provided to support data harmonisation and reproducibility.
  - Data accessibility noted via data.gov.uk and HMS-related sources, with detailed metadata included in the accompanying file.

- Usage notes for data support
  - The dataset enables long-term analysis of DOC dynamics in a large UK river system and evaluation of anthropogenic influences (e.g., urbanisation, wastewater treatment).
  - When using colour-derived DOC (1883–1990), users should account for potential non-stationarity and compare against independent DOC records when possible.
  - The metadata file provides essential context on units, sampling frequency, and data sources to facilitate integration with other datasets or dashboards.
