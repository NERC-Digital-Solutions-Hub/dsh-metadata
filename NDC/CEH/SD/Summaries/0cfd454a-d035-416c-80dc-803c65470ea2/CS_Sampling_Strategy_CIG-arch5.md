# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey up to 2007 and how it evolved from the ITE Land Classification developed starting in 1978.
- Emphasises the linkage between sampling design, land classification, and the production of national and country-specific environmental estimates across surveys (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification
- Early basis: stratified, random sampling of land using environmental attributes to define 32 land classes.
- 1978: 1 km square sampling framework with central classified squares and surrounding ones; 8 samples per class (256 total).
- 1984: sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total) to improve landscape-level estimates.
- 1990: Land Classification revised to cover all 1 km squares in GB; urban/sea corrections; results published for CS1990.
- 1998–2000: Further development to allow separate Scotland England/Wales reporting; classification expanded to 40 classes; reclassification sometimes reallocated squares to neighboring classes.
- 2007: Wales-specific reporting needs prompted additional Wales-focused subdivisions; 45 strata created; 43 extra Welsh squares added; England adjustments balanced to maintain precision.

## Sampling Framework Across Surveys
- 1978 (CS1978): 
  - Use ISA-based classification to create 32 classes from 1228 center squares (15x15 km grid); 4 surrounding squares classified per center.
  - 6039 km2 across classified squares; 256 total sample squares surveyed.
  - National habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square and land class area.
- 1984 (CS1984):
  - 12 squares per land class (384 total); builds on 1978 framework.
- 1990 (CS1990): 
  - All GB squares classified; 508 survey squares sampled.
  - Adds Land Cover Mapping linkage; repeat vegetation/quadrat data collected.
- 2000 (CS2000):
  - Reworked classification to enable country-level estimates (England with Wales, Scotland separately).
  - 40 strata created via sub-division/aggregation of land classes; additional squares allocated to ensure representation of new classes.
  - Separate country estimates introduced; Isle of Man data replaced to align with country reporting.
  - Wales-specific upland habitat module added to improve accuracy for upland estimates.
- 2007 (CS2007):
  - Wales-only reporting driven by devolution and policy needs; adjustments made to class structure (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - 45 strata overall; further Welsh sample augmentation to ensure adequate representation.
  - England classes 5e and 15e left with fewer squares but still considered adequate for reporting.

## Data Products, Access, and Documentation
- Key outputs include national and country-specific estimates of habitat types and land-use features, published as major reports:
  - Countryside Survey 1990: main report (CS1990 vol.2).
  - Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007 (CS2007) and related documentation.
- Land Classification maps and accompanying figures illustrate revised classifications and sampling frameworks:
  - Figures 4–7 depict England with Wales and Scotland classifications, Wales-adjusted frameworks, and sample square distributions.
- Methodological notes discuss consistency considerations when changing classifications across surveys and the trade-off between using the latest versus original classifications for national estimates.

## Data Stewardship implications for Governance
- Versioning and provenance:
  - Maintain explicit metadata for each survey’s Land Classification version and the corresponding sample frame.
  - Capture crosswalks or mappings between old and new classifications to preserve temporal comparability.
- Temporal comparability:
  - Document how changes in class definitions and country-unit subdivisions affect trend analysis and national estimates.
  - Clearly distinguish England with Wales vs Scotland reporting when aggregating results.
- Data architecture and storage:
  - Archive per-survey classifications, sample squares, and associated attribute data (habitat, land-use, vegetation quadrats).
  - Store maps and tabular summaries that accompany each survey’s reporting.
- Data quality and uncertainty:
  - Track changes in sample size by class and country to assess precision and potential biases.
  - Maintain notes on how additional upland modules and Welsh class subdivisions improve or alter estimate accuracy.
- Data sharing and governance:
  - Ensure that Wales-only and Scotland-only outputs are accessible alongside UK-wide results.
  - Provide clear documentation to support reuse of historical datasets in longitudinal studies.

## Key Takeaways
- The Countryside Survey sampling strategy is a long-running, stratified, random sampling framework tightly coupled with the ITE Land Classification.
- Over time, the classification and sampling framework have been adapted to enable country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and to accommodate devolved governance needs, while aiming to preserve the ability to compare trends across survey cycles.
- Data governance should focus on meticulous metadata management, version control, crosswalks between classifications, and transparent documentation to sustain data discoverability, interoperability, and reuse.
