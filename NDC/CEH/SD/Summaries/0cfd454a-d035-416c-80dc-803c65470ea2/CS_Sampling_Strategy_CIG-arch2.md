# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Purpose and Scope
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Anchored in the ITE Land Classification to provide a consistent, time-series framework for monitoring environmental health and policy performance.
- Aims to produce representative estimates of habitat and land-cover across Great Britain, with increasing emphasis on country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales).

## Core concepts: Land Classification and Stratified Sampling
- Stratified, random sampling is used to minimize bias and ensure all parts of the landscape are represented.
- The ITE Land Classification groups GB land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate).
- Early classification (1970s–1980s) used 32 classes derived from 1 km squares; subsequent updates expanded to 40 classes (1990), 45 classes (2000), and country-unit subdivisions (2007) to support Wales/England reporting and Scotland reporting.
- Sampling frames link the area of each land class to the expected habitat metrics within that class.

## Timeline of Developments and Sampling Frameworks
- 1978 CS (Initial Land Classification): 256 squares surveyed (8 per class); centralized sampling from centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid with surrounding squares classified; national estimates based on mean habitat per square times class area.
- 1984 CS (Second Field Survey): 384 squares (12 per class); maintained framework but increased sample size; results published later.
- 1990 CS (All Squares Land Classification): Classification updated to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; included repeat of 1978 quadrats; linked with the first Land Cover Map of GB; results published in CS1990 main report.
- 1998–2000 CS (Revised Land Classification and National Estimates): Scale-up to allow separate Scottish reporting; Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; separate country estimates introduced; 19 additional Wales squares added; upland habitat module added to improve England/Wales upland estimates.
- 2007 CS (Welsh Reporting): Wales-specific adjustments to enable Wales-only reporting; new Welsh class subdivisions created (five new Welsh classes); total Welsh sampling increased; some English classes reduced to four squares per class; new framework supported 45 strata across the three countries.

## Separate Country Estimates and Upland Module
- Country-unit framework (England with Wales, Scotland) adopted to provide more reliable, country-specific estimates.
- Wales required additional sampling due to devolved reporting needs; upland habitats were targeted with an added module of 30 upland squares to improve accuracy in England and Wales.

## Survey Outputs and Use in Monitoring
- Outputs include habitat area estimates, land-class maps, and time-series data across GB and by country.
- Data are designed for clear reporting to policymakers and environmental bodies, enabling assessment of habitat change and compliance with policy targets.
- Considerations are provided for comparing estimates across surveys, given changes in land classification; guidance emphasizes consistency versus contemporaneous classification use.

## Data Handling and Accessibility
- Emphasis on storing and updating datasets within appropriate data portals; standardized formats support broad accessibility and reuse.
- The strategy supports transparent monitoring, enabling others to access underlying data used to produce outputs.
