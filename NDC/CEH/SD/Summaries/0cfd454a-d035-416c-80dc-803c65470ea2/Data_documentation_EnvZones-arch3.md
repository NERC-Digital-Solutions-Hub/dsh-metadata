# Countryside Survey Environmental Zones 2007

## Overview and purpose
- Zones were created to report Countryside Survey results at a sub-GB level, aggregating ITE Land Classes into environmentally defined areas for analysis above the level of individual ITE classes.
- Countryside Survey is a nationwide environmental survey of Great Britain, repeated roughly every 10 years since 1978, based on a 1km square sampling framework.

## Data structure and geographic scope
- Dataset columns:
  - Envzone: Zone number (numeric)
  - Description: Zone description (text)
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system / projection: British National Grid (OSGB36), Transverse Mercator
- Extent: Great Britain
- Associated datasets: 
  - ITE Land Classification (2007)
  - Countryside Survey dataset (official site)

## How zones are defined
- Environmental Zones are aggregations of ITE Land Classes derived from multivariate environmental data for each 1km square.
- Zones reflect combinations of environmental characteristics, rather than a single parameter (e.g., altitude).
- The document provides a mapping (ITE Land Class Numbers to Environmental Zones) outlining how classes are aggregated into zones.

## Zone naming and geography
- Zones are named EZ1 through EZ9, with a hierarchical GB perspective (Scotland, England, Wales) and a separate Northern Ireland reference.
- Zone names listed:
  - EZ1 Easterly Lowlands, England
  - EZ2 Westerly Lowlands, England
  - EZ3 Uplands, England
  - EZ4 Lowlands, Scotland
  - EZ5 Intermediate Uplands and Islands, Scotland
  - EZ6 True Uplands, Scotland
  - EZ7 Northern Ireland (reported separately, not included in this dataset)
  - EZ8 Lowlands, Wales
  - EZ9 Uplands, Wales

## Background and purpose within Countryside Survey
- Environmental Zones enable reporting of survey results at a sub-GB level while going beyond the 45 individual ITE Land Classes.
- The zones are derived from the recurring Countryside Survey data collection framework (1km squares) and reflect average environmental characteristics for zone delineation.

## Data quality, governance, and use in monitoring
- The dataset is designed to facilitate monitoring and reporting at a policy-relevant spatial scale, enabling stakeholders to compare environmental results across defined zones.
- Data is derived from established datasets (ITE Land Classification) and public Countryside Survey outputs; metadata and provenance are embedded in the associated documentation.
- The document references further reading for methodology and sampling strategy (Barr 1998; Bunce et al. 1996; Carey et al. 2008).
