# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Outline the field survey sampling framework used by Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007, to monitor environmental change, support policy decisions, and inform future decisions. The strategy is tightly coupled with the ITE Land Classification and its evolution over three decades.
- Core idea: Use stratified, random sampling of land classified by environmental attributes to ensure representative, comparable national habitat estimates while enabling country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland).

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification

- Origin: The ITE Land Classification was developed in the 1970s to stratify large-scale ecological surveys and ensure representative samples.
- Method: Classification built from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) using multivariate analysis (initially Indicator Species Analysis for quadrats, scaled to 1 km squares).
- Scale and classes: Began with 32 land classes in the 1970s; expanded over time to better reflect regional differences (up to 40 classes in CS1990, then 45 classes by CS2000 and CS2007) to accommodate Scotland and Wales reporting.
- Practical constraints: Early classification used a centric sampling approach (centre squares of a 15x15 km grid); later efforts pursued classification of all GB 1 km squares using surrogates due to computing limitations.

## Survey Phases and Sampling Frameworks

- CS1978 (Initial Survey): Used 8 samples per Land Class across 32 classes, totaling 256 1 km squares; national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class.
- CS1984 (Second Survey): Expanded to 12 squares per class (total 384); continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- CS1990 ('All Squares' Land Classification): Revised to classify every GB square using a broader Land Classification; 508 squares were surveyed; data collection included repeat vegetation quadrats from 1978.
- CS2000 (Revised Land Classification): Introduced country-unit estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) with class subdivisions and aggregations to create 40 strata; added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; uplands module added to improve upland habitat estimates; Wales required more dedicated sampling due to devolved policy needs.
- CS2007 (Welsh-focused Adjustments): Wales-specific reporting required further Wales-England sub-divisions (creating five new Wales-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares (43) ensured minimum representation (at least 6 squares per Welsh class); some English classes ended with as few as 4 squares per class due to sampling constraints.

## Country Reporting and Welsh Adjustments

- England with Wales vs. Scotland: CS2000 refined the framework to produce separate country estimates using country-unit classifications; aggregation and sub-division of land classes ensured adequate representation per country.
- Wales-specific changes (CS2007): Added Welsh class subdivisions and increased Welsh sampling to improve Wales-only estimates; England adjustments followed from the removal of some Welsh squares, with a focus on maintaining precision where feasible.

## Uplands Module

- Purpose: To improve statistical accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales for country-based reporting.
- Approach: Added around 30 squares placed in upland land classes to bolster representation and precision in upland habitat estimates within CS2000.

## Estimation Approach and Data Consistency

- National estimates: For earlier surveys, estimates were derived by multiplying the mean habitat area per square by the area of each Land Class; this approach is sensitive to changes in Land Classification.
- Consistency considerations: A 2006 scoping study cautioned that changing the underlying Land Classification affects comparability of national estimates; CS2000 and CS2007 favored using the latest classification for within-survey consistency, while older classifications were used for cross-survey comparability when needed.
- Tables and maps: The document provides detailed tables (e.g., numbers of squares per class, sampling rates) and maps illustrating the evolving Land Classification and sample distributions (CS1978–CS2007).

## Outputs and References

- Main outputs: Countryside Survey reports for each survey year, including the 1990 main report, 2000 country-unit reporting details, and the 2007 UK results for countryside habitats.
- Key references: Foundational CS reports and methodological papers detailing the Land Classification development, sampling procedures, and the rationale for country-specific reporting.

## Implications for Monitoring Framework Authors

- Stratification rationale: Employ stratified random sampling based on robust environmental classifications to ensure representative samples and manageable variance across heterogeneous landscapes.
- Data representation and policy needs: Adapt sampling frameworks to accommodate devolved government reporting requirements (e.g., Wales-specific estimates) while maintaining cross-year comparability where possible.
- Data governance and metadata: Prepare for metadata requirements, transparent data sharing, and documentation of classification changes that impact long-term trend analyses.
- Continuous evolution: Be aware that updating classification schemes can improve policy relevance but may affect historical comparability; balance continuity with the need for current, policy-aligned outputs.
- Practical constraints: Recognize computing and logistical limitations that necessitate surrogate classifications or sampling adjustments, and plan upland and other special modules to address under-sampled areas.
