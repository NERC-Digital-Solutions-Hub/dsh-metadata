# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field Survey sampling strategy used in Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year evolution of the ITE Land Classification system.
  - Demonstrates how the sampling framework is tied to prior surveys (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000) and why continuity is essential for detecting change over time.

- Foundational concept: stratified sampling with the ITE Land Classification
  - Early work introduced the ITE Land Classification to stratify land into discrete classes (originally 32, later expanded).
  - Stratification is used to ensure samples represent the diversity of land types; reduces bias that pure random sampling might introduce.
  - Sampling units are based on 1 km squares, selected within land-class strata, with surrounding squares included to capture within-class variability.

- Development history of the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework
  - 1978 (The Beginning)
    - 1 km square sampling, center squares classified (1228 total) using environmental attributes; eight samples per class (total 256 squares).
  - 1984 (Second survey)
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares and CS1990)
    - Land Classification extended to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - First linkage of field data with land-cover information (e.g., Land Cover Map).
  - 1998–2000 (Revisions for regional reporting)
    - Revisions to enable separate Scotland and England/Wales reporting; increased class count (up to ~40 classes) and redesigned sampling to maintain national representativeness.
    - Introduction of separate country estimates; adjustments to ensure adequate representation across countries.
  - 2007 (Welsh and upland emphasis; Wales-only reporting)
    - Wales-specific adjustments to support Wales-only environmental policy needs.
    - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions; total strata increased (to 45).
    - Substantially more Welsh samples added (to improve Wales reporting); adjustments to class counts and distributions in and across England/Wales/Scotland.
    - Additional upland sampling module implemented to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.

- Sampling design and implementation details
  - Stratified random sampling driven by the ITE Land Classes
    - Land Classes act as strata; within each class, samples are drawn to reflect the area and variability of that class.
  - CS1978 – CS2007 progression
    - 1978: 8 squares per class; total 256.
    - 1984: 12 squares per class; total 384.
    - 1990: all GB squares classified; 508 surveyed.
    - 2000 (CS2000): expanded to 40 strata; added country-unit adjustments for England/Wales and Scotland; upland module added.
    - 2007 (CS2007): further refinements for Wales-only reporting; 45 strata; additional Welsh squares; adjustments to ensure 6 squares per new Welsh class where possible; England reductions in some classes balanced by overall precision considerations.
  - Country-specific reporting and sample allocation
    - Framework adapted to allow England with Wales and Scotland-specific estimates.
    - Class sub-divisions and aggregations created to reflect country boundaries; additional squares allocated to maintain representation in each country unit.
  - Upland module
    - Extra survey squares placed in upland/marginal upland land classes to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

- Data governance, standards, and challenges
  - Data lineage and consistency
    - Changes to the Land Classification over time affect comparability of national estimates; the report notes that national estimates are more consistent when using the latest classification within a survey, but cross-survey consistency may benefit from maintaining alternative reference frameworks.
  - Representation and bias risks
    - Re-distribution and re-classification can distort class representation in countries, necessitating careful design adjustments (e.g., sub-divisions, aggregations, extra squares) to preserve statistical reliability.
  - Computational and data-collection constraints
    - Historical limits in processing power necessitated sampling strategies based on center squares and surrounding allocations; later revisions attempted to classify every GB square using surrogates when full data were impractical.
  - Outputs and documentation
    - Results summarized in main reports and extensive appendices; significant emphasis on documenting classification histories, sampling schemes, and the implications for national estimates.
  - National vs. regional consistency
    - Appendix notes discuss how changing classifications can influence national estimates, and recommend alignment with survey-specific classifications for internal consistency while recognizing cross-survey comparability challenges.

- Key takeaways for data leadership and strategy
  - Maintain strong data lineage
    - Document every version of the Land Classification and its mapping to samples and estimates to support traceability and auditability.
  - Design for long-term comparability and adaptability
    - Use stratified sampling with clear class definitions, while building in mechanisms to reclassify or subdivide classes as policy needs evolve (e.g., Wales-only, uplands).
  - Ensure representative coverage across jurisdictions
    - When governance requires country-specific estimates, allocate additional samples to underrepresented classes in each country unit and adjust strata accordingly.
  - Balance precision and practicality
    - Recognize when to aggregate classes or adjust sample sizes to maintain overall precision without inflating costs; document the trade-offs.
  - Document data products and governance implications
    - Provide clear metadata and explanations of how classifications and sampling choices impact national estimates, enabling informed decision-making by policy colleagues and partners.
