# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The document outlines the evolution of the Countryside Survey (CS) field-sampling framework up to 2007, rooted in the ITE Land Classification developed over 30 years.
- Its core aim is to stratify ecological sampling so that surveys are representative and capable of detecting change over time, using linked classifications and a fixed sampling framework.

## Key concepts

- Stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representativeness of diverse land types.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to define land classes for sampling.
- Historical linkage: CS methodology is inherently tied to its predecessor classifications; changes in classification affect national estimates and comparability across surveys.
- Separate country estimates: over time, sampling Frameworks were adjusted to provide England with Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only reporting, and later Wales-specific reporting.

## Timeline of development and sampling framework

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
  - Indicator Species Analysis used to define 32 land classes from 1228 centre 1 km squares.
  - Surrounding four squares per centre were allocated to classes, creating a total of 6039 km squares considered.
  - Surveyed 8 km squares per land class, totaling 256 samples.
  - National habitat area estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.

- 1984 – Second GB field survey
  - Used the same sampling framework; increased sample size to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Results published later; issues noted about distribution and representativeness.

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990): all-squares Land Classification and third field survey
  - Land Classification revised to classify all squares in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
  - First Land Cover Map for GB linked to the program.
  - All features from 1984 were recorded, plus a repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats.
  - Classification changes caused some mismatches with the original 1978 framework; regional/remote areas were adjusted.

- 1998 – Revised land classification and fourth field survey
  - GB-wide reclassification to enable separate Scottish reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
  - CS1990 estimates were recalculated using the updated classification.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000): framework for separate country estimates
  - Addressed policy needs to produce England and Wales, and Scotland-specific estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; class aggregation used where counts were low; resulting in 40 strata.
  - Additional squares added to improve representation of new classes (plus 19 extra squares for Wales representation, plus 11 extra to balance England-Wales sampling).
  - Upland module added to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.
  - Table/summary of sampling allocations by country and class provided.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting and further Wales/England adjustments
  - Wales required more robust Wales-only results; existing 64 Welsh squares insufficient for Wales-only reporting.
  - Changes:
    - Sub-divide Land Classes into country-unit versions for England and Wales (creating 5 new Wales/England-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Increase total strata to 45.
    - Add 43 extra squares in Wales (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class).
    - England classes adjusted accordingly; two English classes (5e, 15e) end with 4 squares per class, but precision deemed acceptable.
  - Wales-specific class maps and England/Wales/Scotland allocations updated (Figure references in document).
  - Total GB sample squares in CS2007: 591 (England 288, Scotland 203, Wales 107).

## Separate country estimates and representation

- CS1990 used a GB-wide 32-class framework for national estimates, with country estimates derived from mean characteristics across countries.
- CS2000 introduced “country units” (England with Wales, and Scotland) and subdivided Land Classes to improve country-specific estimates; this also led to new sampling rules and the need for additional squares to ensure adequate representation in each country.
- CS2007 further refined country-unit classifications to support Wales-only reporting, with Wales receiving substantial additional sampling.

## Uplands module

- An additional module funded to improve upland habitat estimates.
- CS2000 added 30 squares located in upland and marginal upland land classes in England and Wales to boost statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in those countries.

## Note on national estimates and classification consistency

- A 2006 scoping study cautioned that changing the underlying Land Classification used for national estimates can affect consistency across surveys.
- For cross-survey consistency, national estimates are best aligned with the latest classification within a survey, though cross-survey comparisons may benefit from the original 1990 classification in some contexts.
- Table 4 in the document provides sample sizes per class under the original 1990 Land Classification for historical comparability.

## Summary of sampling sizes (high-level)

- CS1978: 256 sample squares (8 squares per 32 classes).
- CS1984: 384 sample squares (12 per class; same framework).
- CS1990: 508 sample squares; all GB squares classified; inclusion of Land Cover Map data.
- CS2000: GB total sample size of 569 squares (England & Wales combined), with country-specific allocations (England ~302, Scotland ~195, Wales ~64; upland module added 30 squares).
- CS2007: GB total sample size of 591 squares, with England ~288, Scotland ~203, Wales ~107; Wales receives substantial expansion for Wales-only reporting and five new country-unit classes introduced.
