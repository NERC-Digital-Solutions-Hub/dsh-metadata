# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview and purpose
  - Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field work.
  - Emphasizes the long-running, time-series basis of the methodology and its linkage to prior surveys, essential for understanding change detection.
  - Aims to support robust, map-based data products by providing a stratified, representative sampling frame across Great Britain and its constituent countries.

- Core concept: ITE Land Classification and sampling philosophy
  - The Land Classification is a stratification tool to ensure samples represent different environmental contexts (not just random sampling).
  - Initially developed in the 1970s using environmental attributes to define 32 Land Classes, then extended and refined over time.
  - Sampling uses 1 km squares as the primary unit, with stratified random selection within each class to balance representation and statistical precision.
  - Early design used the centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares included to reflect local context; eight or more squares per class were surveyed to estimate national totals.

- Timeline and key developments in CS surveys and sampling frameworks
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
    - Developed 32 Land Classes from 1 km squares; eight samples per class (256 total).
    - National estimates derived from class-level means multiplied by class-area proportions.
  - 1984 (Second GB Survey)
    - Expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the original Land Classification for estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Revised to classify every GB square using a Land Classification, enabling broader regional and local estimates.
    - 508 squares surveyed; added Land Cover Map linkage; repeat of vegetation quadrats from 1978.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; CS1990 updates)
    - Land Classification updated to support separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
    - CS1990 results reinterpreted with the revised classification; 569 squares surveyed in CS1998.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Aimed to improve country-specific estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and upland habitat reliability.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata maintained but rebalanced across England, Wales, and Scotland.
    - Additional samples added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland module introduced with 30 extra squares to boost upland estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Responded to Wales-only reporting needs post-devolution.
    - Welsh country-unit classes created (five new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares; several English classes adjusted (some with as few as four squares) to maintain overall precision.
    - Revised class maps and sampling framework published to reflect England with Wales and Scotland distributions.

- Separate country estimates and Wales-specific adjustments
  - CS1990 and CS2000 frameworks allowed estimates to be produced separately for England & Wales and Scotland.
  - CS2007 introduced explicit Wales-only reporting, necessitating further subdivision of Land Classes and targeted sampling in Wales.
  - The sampling plan uses country-unit versions of Land Classes to ensure representative estimates within each country.

- Uplands module
  - An additional CS2000 module added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland areas to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Data structure, mapping, and national estimates
  - Land Classes are mapped (class maps provided) and used to allocate sampling effort spatially.
  - National estimates derive from systematic aggregation of stratum-level data, accounting for class areas and country-specific representations.
  - Considerations are noted regarding comparability across surveys when the Land Classification is updated; a balance is sought between using the latest classification for internal consistency and maintaining cross-survey comparability.

- Note on comparability and methodology considerations
  - Changes to the Land Classification affect the consistency of national stock estimates if cross-survey comparability is required.
  - The document discusses preferred approaches for national estimates, including using the latest country-specific classifications for internal consistency versus maintaining a uniform older classification for cross-survey comparison.

- Endnotes and references
  - Includes brief historical appendix on the ITE Land Classification, acknowledgments, and extensive references to prior CS reports and methodological papers.
  - Figures and tables (e.g., class maps, sample-square distributions by year and country) illustrate how classifications and sampling allocations evolved over time.
