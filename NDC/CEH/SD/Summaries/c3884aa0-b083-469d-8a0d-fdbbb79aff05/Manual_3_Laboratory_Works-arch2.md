# Manual n°3

## Overview
- LRI - University of Antananarivo is a national reference laboratory for soil and plant physico-chemical analyses.
- Period covered: 2014–2016; updated February 2017.
- Focus: soil and plant dynamics in natural and cultivated ecosystems; analyses for research and public service delivery.
- Capabilities include soil handling, physical and chemical analyses (pH, organic carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, oxalate Fe/Al, other elements), and soil biological activity (CO2 and N2O emissions).

## Sample registration and preparation
- All field samples are sent to the laboratory for registration and storage.
- Comprehensive sample tracking data collected and recorded:
  - Person in charge, field and lab IDs
  - Program/project name and sampling period
  - Sampling site and land cover
  - Sample type and depth
  - Sampling method and replication
  - Number of samples and sample IDs
  - Analysis requirements (e.g., Olsen P, NO3/NH4, SOC)
- Each sample is assigned an ID; concordance between field and lab IDs is checked, and a final electronic concordance list is produced.

## Sample analysis and methods
- Sample preparation: air-drying, grinding, and sieving (2 mm or 0.2 mm) as required by method.
- Soil organic carbon (SOC)
  - Chemical analysis for a subset; Mid-Infrared Spectrometry (MIRS) on whole samples.
  - SOC determined by Walkley and Black (1934) method (wet oxidation with potassium dichromate, acid medium, followed by titration).
  - MIRS models developed from a subset; use accurate MIRS models to predict SOC for remaining samples.
- Soil texture
  - Chemical analyses and MIRS for prediction.
  - Particle-size analysis (AFNOR 1999) after organic matter removal with H2O2; dispersion with sodium pyrophosphate; dry sieving for sand; pipette method for silt/clay.
  - MIRS used to build models predicting texture; apply to remaining samples.
- Bulk density
  - Determined from dry soil weight after removing >2 mm fraction.
- Natural 13C abundance (δ13C)
  - Analyses on selected sieved soils; some samples sent to external lab for additional chemical analyses.
  - MIRS-based predictions extended to δ13C values.
- External/special analyses
  - Some analyses outsourced to specialized external labs as needed.

## Data publication and dissemination
- All datasets generated are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- Data published or in publication process, including several journal articles listed with authors and titles (e.g., effects of land-use changes on carbon stocks; soil organic carbon variability; organic carbon stocks after land-cover changes).
- References for methods: AFNOR (1999) and Walkley & Black (1934).

## Key outputs and relevance for environmental monitoring
- Production of standardized, traceable soil and plant analytical data to support environmental health assessment and policy-relevant insights.
- Datasets support understanding of soil carbon stocks, texture, and isotopic characteristics under different land-use/land-cover contexts in Madagascar.
- Data archiving and publication enable reuse and cross-study comparison, aligning with quality assurance and data-sharing goals emphasized for environmental monitoring.
