  - Notes on data quality
    - Blank cells mean no data available

- Data quality, provenance, and metadata
  - Variables include clear types and units to support validation, filtering, and comparisons across zones and depths.
  - Metadata supports discoverability (Z drilling, location, site) and future data integration.
  - Data gaps are explicitly indicated by blank cells, highlighting the need for targeted data collection or imputation decisions.

- Data usage and stewardship considerations for Data Leaders
  - Ensure proper data asset management: maintain format, quality, metadata, and discoverability; plan for updates as new data arrive.
  - Align with user needs by enabling cross-zone and depth-based analyses of soil organic carbon via 13C isotope values.
  - Facilitate co-ownership of data products by stakeholders across the ESPA and P4GES networks.
  - Adhere to acknowledgement requirements when disseminating products derived from these data.
  - Coordinate with partners or labs (e.g., Laboratoire des Radio Isotopes) to maintain data provenance and integrity.
