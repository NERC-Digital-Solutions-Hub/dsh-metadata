# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- Context and aim
  - The p4ges project in Madagascar investigates paying for global ecosystem services to alleviate poverty, focusing on carbon stock assessment within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ).
  - WP4 covers carbon stock assessment across five IPCC pools (ABG, BGB, litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon) with emphasis on AGB, litter, deadwood, and soil survey.
  - All generated datasets are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC); related work feeds into broader carbon mapping and land-use change analyses.

- Study design and data scope
  - Four Zones of Interest (ZOIs) representing CAZ variability: Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, Didy.
  - Land uses: closed canopy, tree fallow, shrub fallow, tany maty/degraded land; reforestation recognized through NGO/local interviews.
  - Field sites: 16 plots per ZOI (4 land-use types × 4 replicates), with additional plots in some ZOIs to capture carbon stock variability (total: 28–48 sites per ZOI).
  - Site criteria: slope < 45 degrees, patches near habitat centers, minimum 120 m × 120 m, edge effects avoided, no disturbance hotspots, distances ≥ 500 m between sites.
  - Data capture includes GPS coordinates, slope, land-use history, and transect/plot-level measurements.

- Data collection, forms, and documentation
  - Administrative and field prep
    - Permits, mission orders, and insurance completed before fieldwork.
  - Field data collection forms (five types)
    - Site characteristics; inventory (natural regeneration, standing and fallen dead wood, tree inventory); coverage (Braun-Blanquet); sapling/litter/root sampling; soil profile description.
  - Materials and samples
    - Field tools (compass, vertex, flags, quadrats, augers, cylinders) and labeled sample bags; photos stored in project data center.
  - Data entry and archiving
    - Field forms scanned and stored; data entered in Excel; photos renamed and stored at Bangor University data center; datasets archived in the EIDC repository as ESPA WP4 data.
  - Sample management
    - Field-to-lab sample tagging with lab numbers; tracking between field provenance and lab analyses.

- Sampling design and field procedures
  - Plot-level design
    - Central circular plots with nested subplots for biomass and soil assessments; 5 m radius base plot used for all C pools (degraded land uses included).
  - Biomass and component sampling
    - Saplings (DBH < 5 cm, H > 1.30 m): 4 subplots with targeted species sampling.
    - Trees (DBH ranges 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm, >20 cm): measurement of DBH, height, local names; standing dead wood recorded; diameter at top and base for standing dead wood.
    - Lying dead wood: transect-based diameter intercepts recorded; wood density category noted (Sound, Intermediate, Rotten).
    - Direct aboveground biomass: subset of 54 trees felled, weighed by component (trunk, branches, leaves); moisture for lab analysis.
    - Understorey, litter, and root mat: 25 cm × 25 cm quadrats for litter/root mat; 1 m × 1 m quadrats for understorey biomass; lab sampling of biomass.
  - Root description
    - 1 m² soil pits centered in plots; roots classified as medium (<10 mm) or coarse (>10 mm); root density and depth described.
  - Soil sampling and analysis
    - Soil carbon content via auger sampling at 0–100 cm in four subplots (10 cm increments).
    - Bulk density via 8.1 cm diameter cylinders at depths of interest (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm).
    - Soil profile description in a 1.30 m soil pit (horizons, color, texture, porosity).
    - Additional soil data: site-specific coordinates, slope, deforestation history.

- Data handling, processing, and storage
  - Data entry and archiving
    - Field data scanned, Excel entries created, photos organized, all stored in project data centers and submitted to EIDC.
  - Sample handling
    - Field samples delivered to LRI laboratory; stored at room temperature, air-dried; lab numbers tied to field provenance; worksheets linked to tests.
  - Analytical workflow (biomass and soil)
    - Biomass: samples dried to constant weight; wood-specific gravity determined; allometry-based biomass estimates per tree; plot-level biomass scaled to per-hectare values; carbon stock derived from biomass using established factors (Brown 2002).
    - Litter, understorey, and roots: dry weights converted to plot-level carbon stocks using same 0.5 conversion factor; dead wood stocks calculated via volume-density methods (lying and standing) and species density classes; soil organic carbon stock calculated per soil layer using bulk density, carbon content, and layer thickness; both SOC30 and SOC100 estimated to capture depth-related stock changes.
  - Data integration and publication
    - All data prepared for publication; connections to national soil carbon mapping and carbon stock studies; data and references cited in project outputs.

- Data standards, governance, and reuse
  - Data lineage and provenance
    - Clear mapping from field measurements through laboratory analyses to final carbon stock calculations; consistent use of units and definitions (DBH, H, WSG, SOC, etc.).
  - Metadata and interoperability
    - Use of standardized land-use categories, zone identifiers, and site codes; integration with GIS-derived coordinates; archived datasets in EIDC ensure long-term preservation and accessibility.
  - Access, licensing, and publication
    - Datasets published or prepared for publication; primary findings and data contributions linked to several peer-reviewed papers; data stewardship emphasizes traceability and reproducibility.

- Challenges and considerations for data stewards
  - Incomplete representation of user needs and data discovery gaps.
  - Timely data delivery from field to lab; adherence to standards across diverse data types and formats.
  - Managing data across multiple systems (field forms, Excel, lab databases) and large datasets.
  - Interoperability across land uses and sampling methods; ensuring consistency in biomass, soil, and dead wood calculations.
  - Handling outdated or heterogeneous databases with bespoke solutions; ensuring robust metadata for future reuse.

- Endnotes and references
  - Glossaries and abbreviations (e.g., AGB, BGB, SOC, DBH, WSG, LU, ZOI) and foundational references for methods (IPCC guidelines, Braun-Blanquet scale, Brown 2002; Walker et al. 2012; and others cited in the document).
