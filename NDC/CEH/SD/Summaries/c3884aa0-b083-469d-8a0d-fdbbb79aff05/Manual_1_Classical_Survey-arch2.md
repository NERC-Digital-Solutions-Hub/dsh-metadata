# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon)

## Context and Aims
- The p4ges project in Madagascar explores paying for global ecosystem services to alleviate poverty, focusing on carbon among ecosystem services.
- WP4 conducts carbon stock assessment across the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ) using five IPCC pools: Aboveground biomass (AGB), Belowground biomass (BGB), Litter, Dead wood (DW), and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC).
- This manual (Manual n°1) establishes the first step of carbon quantification in CAZ, focusing on AGB, litter, deadwood, and soil; datasets are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Sampling Design and Zones
- Four Zones of Interest (ZOI) selected to capture CAZ representativeness:
  - ZOI1 Lakato, ZOI2 Andasibe, ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, ZOI4 Didy.
- ZOI criteria include biophysical variables (altitude, slope, bioclimate), deforestation history, and accessibility.
- In each ZOI, land-use types targeted: Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty/Degraded land, plus reforestation as identified through NGO/local community input.
- Site selection criteria (per WP4 and WP2/WP5 needs):
  - Slope less than 45 degrees
  - Transects near patch centers to minimize edge effects
  - Each site ≥ 120 m × 120 m
  - Avoid disturbances (e.g., mining) and streams
  - Sites at least 500 m apart
- Sampling effort:
  - 16 plots per ZOI (4 land-use types × 4 replicates)
  - Extra plots for CAZ carbon stock variability:
    - ZOI1: 28 sites, ZOI2: 48 sites, ZOI3: 28 sites, ZOI4: 28 sites

## Site and Land Use Categorization
- Land uses defined according to Styger et al. (2007):
  - Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty/Degraded land
  - Reforestation identified via interviews and included in WP4 sites
- Site identification criteria (beyond land-use type):
  - Central location within habitat patches to avoid edge effects
  - Minimum sampling unit of 120 m × 120 m
  - Transects not across/along streams
- Field reconnaissance validates remote-sensed site proposals and documents land-use history, accessibility, and indicator species

## Field Methods

### Field Reconnaissance and Minimal Area
- Recon teams from biophysical WPs and CI verify suitability and collect land-use indicators and access data.
- Minimal area test established in 2014 to determine representative sampling area; results indicate 16 m² as the minimal area for carbon stock quantification.

### Administrative Preparation and Field Forms
- Pre-field admin: permits, mission orders, insurances.
- Field data collection sheets (five types): site characteristics; inventory (regeneration, standing/die-back wood, tree inventory); canopy cover (Braun-Blanquet); sapling, litter, root sampling; soil profile description.
- Field equipment: compass, vertex, measuring tapes, flags; sampling tools (quadrats, cylinders, augers); labeled sample bags; precise weighing scales.

### Plot Design and Sampling Within Plots
- General plot design for all C pools: circular plots with a 5 m radius (degraded land uses also use this method for soil sampling).
- Closed canopy and fallows:
  - Four subplots within a circular plot, with nested sampling radii:
    - 2 m radius: saplings (DBH < 5 cm, H > 1.3 m) across 5 species
    - 5 m radius: diameter at breast height (DBH) and height for trees 5–10 cm DBH
    - 10 m radius: DBH and height for 10–20 cm DBH trees
    - 20 m radius: DBH, height, and local names for trees >20 cm DBH
  - Standing dead wood: measure DBH, height; record wood density category (Sound, Intermediate, Rotten)
  - Lying dead wood: measured along a 100 m transect; record intercept diameters and wood density
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) by direct measurement: 54 trees sampled and weighed by components (trunk, branches, leaves) after felling
  - Understorey vegetation, litter, and root mat: 25 cm × 25 cm quadrats for litter/root mat; 1 m × 1 m quadrats for understorey biomass
  - Root description: 1 m² pit to classify roots as Medium Root (2–10 mm) or Coarse Root (>10 mm); record depth distribution
  - Percent cover: indicator species within a 5 m radius; Braun-Blanquet scale (0 to 6)
- Degraded land (tany maty):
  - No large trees; biomass, root mat, litter sampled as per closed-canopy method; soil sampling mirrors other land uses

### Soil Sampling and Profiling
- Soil sampling positions coincide with understorey sampling points (1, 2, 3, 4):
  - Bulk density: cylinder method at depths 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm
  - Soil carbon: auger samples at 0–100 cm in 10 cm increments
- Soil profile description in subplot soil pit (center of plot) to 1.3 m depth:
  - Record horizon colors (Munsell), textures, structures, root abundance, and porosity

### Other Collected Data
- GPS coordinates, slope, and deforestation history (from local interviews)

## Data Handling and Laboratory Analysis

### Data Entry and Archiving
- Field forms scanned and stored; data entered into Excel
- Photos labeled and stored in project data center
- All field and lab data archived in the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC)

### Sample Management
- Field samples sent to LRI (Laboratoire des RadioIsotopes) for analysis
- Samples dried and stored; lab numbers established; traceability between field and lab

### Biomass and Soil Analyses
- Biomass: air-dried, then oven-dried at 75°C to determine dry biomass; Wood Specific Gravity (WSG) determined in Lab 4
- Soil analyses:
  - Walkley-Black method for initial soil organic carbon (SOC)
  - Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for SOC prediction (calibrated to Walkley-Black results)
  - δ13C stable isotope analysis for selected samples (Montpellier, France) to assess soil carbon dynamics

## Data Processing and Carbon Stock Calculations

### Aboveground Biomass
- Tree-level biomass estimated with allometry (various published equations; e.g., Chave et al. 2005/2014; Vielledent et al. 2012)
- Plot-level AGB density (Mg ha-1) derived by summing tree biomass and scaling to per-hectare area
- Carbon stock: biomass density × 0.5 (Brown 2002) to convert biomass to C

### Litter, Understorey, and Root Mat
- Biomass from field weights scaled to per-hectare area
- Carbon stock calculated using 0.5 conversion factor

### Dead Wood
- Lying dead wood: biomass calculated from volume and density; volume estimated from diameters along transects
- Standing dead wood: biomass derived from volume and density
- C stock estimated by applying species- or category-specific density

### Soil Organic Carbon (SOC)
- SOC stock per depth layer calculated as SOC = Σ (BDi × Ci × (1 − CFi) × ti × 0.1)
  - BDi: bulk density for layer i
  - Ci: soil carbon content (g kg-1)
  - CFi: coarse fraction > 2 mm
  - ti: layer thickness (cm)
- SOC stock computed for 0–30 cm (SOC30) and 0–100 cm (SOC100)
- Equivalent mass method used to account for land-use density differences
