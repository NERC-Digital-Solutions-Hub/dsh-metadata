## Data quality, metadata, and governance considerations
- Metadata gaps may require contacting dataset originators to verify details or add metadata.
- Public sharing of underlying data may present barriers depending on governance and licensing.
- Data may need transformation to align units or formats for use in monitoring dashboards and reports.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks and policy
- Provides spatially and depth-resolved isotopic carbon information suitable for assessing soil carbon stocks and dynamics.
- Supports evaluation of land management and restoration policies through measurable soil carbon indicators.
- Facilitates reporting through clear data structure, provenance, and open data considerations when governance allows.
