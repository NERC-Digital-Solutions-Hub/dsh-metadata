# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

## Context and Aim
- The p4ges project in Madagascar investigates paying for global ecosystem services to alleviate poverty, focusing on carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ).
- WP4 conducts carbon stock surveys across five IPCC-defined pools (AGB, BGB, litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon) with emphasis on AGB, litter, deadwood, and soil surveys.
- The manual documents the first steps for carbon quantification in CAZ and states that all generated datasets have been archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Study design and Zones of Interest (ZOI)
- Four Zones of Interest (ZOI) identified to represent CAZ biophysical diversity and deforestation history: ZOI1 Lakato, ZOI2 Andasibe, ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, ZOI4 Didy.
- Land uses defined for sampling: closed canopy, tree fallow, shrub fallow, tany maty (degraded land); reforestation included based on consultations.
- Site selection criteria beyond land use: slope <45°, transects near habitat centers to minimize edge effects, minimum 120m x 120m plots, avoidance of disturbances (e.g., mining), no streams across transects, minimum 500m between sites.
- Sampling plan: 16 plots per ZOI (4 land uses x 4 replicates); WP4 added extra plots to capture C stock variability ( total sites: 28 in ZOI1, 48 in ZOI2, 28 in ZOI3, 28 in ZOI4).

## Field reconnaissance and minimal area
- Field reconnaissance by cross-WP teams to verify site suitability, land-use type, and accessibility; capture land-use history and indicator species.
- Minimal area test established 16 m² as the representative sampling area for carbon stock quantification.

## Administrative setup and field documents
- Pre-field administrative steps: permits, mission orders, insurances.
- Field forms: five types covering site characteristics, inventory (including regeneration, standing/dieback wood, tree inventory), percent cover (Braun-Blanquet), sampling of saplings/litter/roots/understorey, soil profile.
- Field materials and sample handling: compass, plotting aids, quadrats, sample bags, labeling and precise weighing equipment.

## Design sampling and plot-level methods
- General plot design: 5 m radius sampling plot for all pools; degraded land uses follow the same scheme.
- Closed canopy and fallows:
  - Four subplots within the circular plot with nested measurement radii (2 m for saplings, 5 m for 5–10 cm DBH trees, 10 m for 10–20 cm DBH trees, 20 m for >20 cm DBH trees).
  - Standing dead wood measured at multiple heights; lying dead wood recorded along a 100 m transect.
  - Direct aboveground biomass measured via felling and weighing of 54 trees (four species) with components separated (trunk, branches, leaves); moisture content determined in lab.
  - Understorey vegetation, litter, and root mat sampled with 25 cm x 25 cm quadrats (litter/root mat) and 1 m x 1 m quadrats (understorey); all biomass weighed and samples sent to lab.
  - Root description in a 1 m² pit; roots categorized as medium (<10 mm) or coarse (>10 mm); distribution and depth described.
  - Percent cover estimated for indicator species within a 5 m radius using Braun-Blanquet scale.
- Degraded land (tany maty):
  - No large trees; biomass sampling, root description, litter and understorey sampling conducted per the same plot design.

## Soil sampling and soil profile
- Soil sampling aligned with understorey sampling points.
- Two methods: auger sampling for SOC content to 0–100 cm (0–10, 10–20, ..., 90–100 cm) and cylindrical sampling for bulk density at 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm.
- Soil profile description in a central soil pit (depth ~1.3 m) to document horizons, colors (Munsell), textures, structures, root depth, and porosity.
- Additional site data: GPS coordinates, slope, deforestation history.

## Laboratory analyses and data handling
- Biomass: samples air-dried and oven-dried (75°C) to determine dry biomass; wood specific gravity (WSG) determined in separate analyses.
- Soil analyses:
  - Sample preparation: air-drying, sieving to 2 mm, fraction separation of coarse elements; soil milled to 200 microns for standard analyses.
  - Moisture content determined by oven drying at 105°C (48 hours).
  - Walkley-Black method for rapid soil organic carbon estimation (calibration reference for later methods).
  - Mid Infra-Red Spectroscopy (MIRS) to predict soil carbon content, calibrated against Walkley-Black results.
  - Carbon stable isotope analysis (δ13C) for selected samples to study carbon dynamics and land-use discrimination; conducted at LBMP (Montpellier, France).
- Data handling and storage:
  - Field forms scanned and archived; data entered into Excel; photos stored on project data center.
  - Data organized into data series; uploaded to EIDC for long-term storage and valorization.
  - Field samples tracked with field-to-lab numbering; lab worksheets assigned and linked to field provenance.

## Data processing and carbon stock calculations
- Aboveground biomass:
  - Allometric equations (direct measurements and literature-based equations) used to estimate biomass per tree; plot-level biomass scaled to per hectare.
  - Carbon stock derived from biomass using established conversion factors.
  - Floristic analyses (richness, diversity) and spatial structure of biomass assessed.
- Litter, understorey, and root mats:
  - Dry biomass converted from field measurements, then scaled to Mg ha⁻¹; carbon stock calculated similarly to aboveground biomass.
- Dead wood:
  - Lying dead wood: biomass calculated from volume and density using diameter-based measurements along 100 m transects; carbon stock summed per plot.
  - Standing dead wood: biomass from volume-density calculations; aggregated to plot-level carbon stocks.
- Soil carbon (SOC):
  - SOC stocks computed per depth layer using BD, C content, coarse fraction, and layer thickness (SOC30 and SOC100); alternative equivalent mass method applied to reflect density differences across land-use types.
  - SOC stocks reported per depth (0–30 cm and 0–100 cm) for comparability and sensitivity to land management.

## Data publication and references
- Data and findings intended for publication and integration into broader scientific outputs (including national soil organic carbon mapping and land-use impact studies).
- References cited span IPCC guidelines, soil carbon methodologies, and prior Madagascar-focused carbon studies.
- Outputs include datasets and peer-reviewed papers (examples listed in the document) and continued data sharing via EIDC and affiliated publications.

## Key data products and reuse potential
- Spatially explicit carbon stock datasets by pool (AGB, BGB, litter, dead wood, SOC) across CAZ and ZOIs.
- Field forms, sampling templates, and methodological protocols for replication or reuse in similar tropical forest contexts.
- Laboratory data linking field measurements to SOC and isotopic analyses for carbon dynamics studies.
- Long-term, archived data suitable for national-scale carbon mapping, land-use change analyses, and policy support for payments for ecosystem services.
