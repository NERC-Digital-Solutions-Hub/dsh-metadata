# Manual n°3

## Overview
- LRI (Laboratoire des RadioIsotopes) at the University of Antananarivo is a national reference lab for physico-chemical analyses of soil and plant, supporting research and public service delivery.
- Focuses on soil and plant dynamics in natural and cultivated ecosystems; performs a range of analyses and maintains sample registration, storage, and data publication processes.

## Analyses performed
- Soil handling and preparation: drying, grinding, sieving.
- Soil physical analysis: texture, soil aggregation.
- Soil chemical analysis: pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total and available phosphorus, total and mineral nitrogen, cation exchange capacity (CEC), oxalate iron and aluminium, other elements (manganese, silica).
- Soil biological activity: CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions.
- Analytical approaches include standard chemical methods and Mid-Infrared Spectrometry (MIRS) for predictive modeling of properties.

## Sample registration and preparation
- Field samples are received, registered, and stored by the lab.
- Metadata collected for each sample:
  - Person in charge, field sample ID
  - Program/project name and project sample ID
  - Sampling period and site
  - Sample type (soil, plant, etc.)
  - Sampling method and depth
  - Land cover or cropping system
  - Number of samples and list of sample IDs
  - Analysis requirements (e.g., SOC, NO3/NH4, etc.)
- An ID is generated for each sample; concordance between field and lab IDs checked; final electronic list produced for tracking.

## Sample analysis
- Soil samples are air-dried, ground, and sieved (2 mm or 0.2 mm) according to method.
- SOC analysis:
  - Walkley and Black (1934) wet oxidation followed by titration.
  - MIRS used on whole samples; a subset (~1/3) for lab-measured SOC to calibrate predictive models; remaining ~2/3 predicted by MIRS models.
- Soils for other chemical analyses prepared similarly; MIRS used to predict corresponding properties from spectral data.

## Soil texture analysis
- Chemical particle-size analysis with organic matter removal (H2O2), dispersion, and separation into fractions (sand by dry sieving; silt/clay by pipette method).
- MIRS used on a subset (n=132) to develop prediction models for texture values; models used to predict texture for remaining samples.

## Bulk density and natural 13C abundance analysis
- Bulk density derived from dry weight after removing >2 mm fraction.
- Natural 13C abundance (13δ) analyzed on selected samples (n=150) by external specialized laboratory.
- MIRS used to predict 13δ values for remaining samples.

## Data publication and dissemination
- All datasets generated are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) and published or in the publication pipeline.
- Included are multiple research outputs related to land-use change, soil organic carbon variability, and carbon stocks following land-cover changes in Madagascar.
- References and bibliographic records provided for data and methodology, including standard AFNOR practices and Walkley-Black method.

## Data management and products
- Emphasis on robust data registration, traceability, and archiving to support sharing and reuse.
- Use of predictive modeling (MIRS) to extend analysis across larger sample sets, enabling efficient data products for end users.
- Outputs targeted toward contributing to broader understanding of soil properties, carbon stocks, and land-use effects, with data published in peer-reviewed outlets and deposited in a national/international data center.
