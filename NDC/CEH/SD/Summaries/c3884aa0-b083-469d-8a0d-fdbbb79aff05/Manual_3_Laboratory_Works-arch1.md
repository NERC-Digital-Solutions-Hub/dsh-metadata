# Manual n°3 Period 2014 - 2016

- Overview
  - The Laboratoire des RadioIsotopes (LRI) at the University of Antananarivo is a national reference laboratory for soil and plant physico-chemical analyses, conducting soil handling and preparation, physical analyses (soil texture, aggregation), chemical analyses (pH, soil organic carbon, total and available phosphorus, total and mineral nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, oxalate iron and aluminium, and other elements such as manganese and silica), and soil biological activity (carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions).
  - Update: February 2017.
  - Outputs include data publication in scientific journals and data archiving; several related papers are listed.
  - Analyses support research on soil and land-use changes and public service delivery.

- 1 Sample registration and preparation
  - All field samples are sent to the laboratory, registered, and stored.
  - Sample tracking information recorded for each sample:
    - Person in charge and field/sample IDs
    - Program or project name and ID
    - Sampling period and site
    - Sample type (soil, plant, etc.)
    - Sampling method, depth
    - Land cover or cropping system
    - Number of samples and list of sample IDs
    - Analysis requirements
  - Each sample receives a lab ID; concordance between field and lab IDs is checked; a final electronic concordance list is generated.

- 2 Sample analysis
  - Sample preparation: air-dried in greenhouse, ground, and sieved (2 mm or 0.2 mm) according to method; samples are bagged for analysis.
  - Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) analysis
    - Chemical analysis using Walkley-Black wet oxidation (potassium dichromate in acid medium with redox titration)
    - Mid-Infrared Spectrometry (MIRS) on all samples to develop prediction models; SOC values for a subset used to calibrate MIRS models; remaining samples predicted by MIRS.
  - Soil texture analysis
    - Chemical analysis for particle size; MIRS on all samples to develop prediction models for texture; remaining samples predicted by MIRS.
  - Bulk density and natural 13C abundance (13δ)
    - Bulk density determined from dry weight after removing >2 mm fraction
    - Natural 13C abundance analyzed for selected soils (n=150) at external laboratory
    - MIRS used to develop models to predict 13δ; remaining samples predicted by MIRS
  - Data handling
    - MIRS is employed to predict SOC, texture, and 13δ for most samples, reducing the need for full chemical analyses on all samples.

- 3 Data publication
  - All datasets generated are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
  - Datasets are published or in process for publication; example papers include:
    - Impact of land use changes on aboveground and soil carbon stocks in a humid tropical forest of Madagascar ( Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 2016)
    - Toward a better understanding of soil organic carbon variability in eastern humid region of Madagascar (under review)
    - Organic carbon stocks in all pools following land cover change in rainforest of Madagascar (under review)
