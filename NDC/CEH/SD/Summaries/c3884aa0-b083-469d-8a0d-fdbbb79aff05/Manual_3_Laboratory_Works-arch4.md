# (Manual n°3) Period 2014 - 2016

- The Laboratoire des RadioIsotopes (LRI) at the University of Antananarivo conducts soil and plant dynamics research and provides physico-chemical soil analyses at national scale.
- The manual outlines the workflow from sample registration and preparation through analyses to data publication, with emphasis on data handling, traceability, and archiving.

## Data lifecycle and management

- Sample registration and tracking
  - Details recorded for each sample: person in charge, program/project name and ID, sampling period, sampling site, sample type, sampling method, sampling depth, land cover or cropping system, total samples, IDs of samples, and analysis requirements.
  - A unique lab ID is generated for each sample; a concordance list links field IDs to lab IDs.
- Sample preparation and analysis workflow
  - Samples sent to LRI; registered and stored upon receipt.
  - Air-drying, grinding, and sieving of soils precede analyses.
  - Documentation of steps ensures traceability of sample handling and preparation.
- Specific analyses and data generation
  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) analysis using Walkley-Black method (wet oxidation with dichromate in sulfuric acid, followed by titration).
  - Mid-Infrared Spectrometry (MIRS) on all samples to develop prediction models for SOC and other properties; about one third of samples used for model calibration, two thirds predicted.
  - Soil texture analysis combining chemical methods with MIRS-based prediction; fractionation into sand, silt, and clay; organic matter removal via H2O2 oxidation.
  - Bulk density measurement from dry soil weight after removing >2 mm fraction.
  - 13C natural abundance (δ13C) on selected subsamples; external labs may perform certain chemical analyses.
  - All MIRS datasets used to build prediction models for properties derived from laboratory measurements.
- Data quality and standardization
  - Methods reference standard procedures (Walkley-Black 1934; AFNOR 1999) to ensure comparability.
  - Use of standardized equipment (e.g., Agilent 4100 ExoScan FTIR) and consistent preprocessing steps for MIRS.
- Data linkage and integrity
  - Final electronic concordance list ensures lab IDs map correctly to field IDs, maintaining data integrity across the workflow.

## Data types and analyses

- Primary data outputs
  - Soil organic carbon content (SOC) from Walkley-Black method.
  - SOC predictions for remaining samples via MIRS-based models.
  - Soil texture predictions (sand/silt/clay) via MIRS models.
  - Soil bulk density measurements.
  - Natural 13C abundance (δ13C) analyses.
- Data modeling and prediction
  - Spectral data from MIRS used to develop predictive models for SOC, texture, and δ13C, enabling efficient estimation for the majority of samples.
- Data publication-ready outputs
  - Datasets generated are archived and prepared for publication, with several related papers cited or in preparation.

## Data publication and reuse

- Archiving and sharing
  - All datasets produced are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) for long-term preservation and access.
- Publications
  - The manual references multiple studies and works emerging from this data, including published articles on land use changes, soil organic carbon variability, and organic carbon stocks following land cover change.
- References and standards
  - Key references include Walkley and Black (1934) for SOC, AFNOR (1999) for soil quality norms, and standard MIRS methodologies.

## Practical implications for Data Leaders

- End-to-end data governance
  - Emphasizes explicit sample-level metadata, traceability between field and lab identifiers, and a formal data workflow from collection to publication.
- Metadata and discoverability
  - Structured registration fields and concordance mapping enhance discoverability and reuse within and beyond the lab.
- Data quality and standardization
  - Use of established standard methods and modeling approaches (MIRS) supports consistency and scalable data generation.
- Data sharing and stewardship
  - Centralized archiving in EIDC demonstrates commitment to long-term data stewardship and availability for the wider research community.
- Collaboration and impact
  - Clear data lineage and publication track record facilitate cross-institution collaboration and contribute to broader understanding of soil carbon dynamics in Madagascar.
