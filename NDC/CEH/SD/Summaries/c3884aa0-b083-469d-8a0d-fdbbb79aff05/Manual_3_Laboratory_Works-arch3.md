- Context and purpose
  - The Laboratoire des RadioIsotopes (LRI) at the University of Antananarivo is a national reference laboratory for physico-chemical analyses of soil and plants, conducting research on soil and plant dynamics in natural ecosystems and cultivated areas.
  - The lab provides soil handling and preparation, physical analyses (soil texture, soil aggregation), chemical analyses (pH, soil organic carbon, total and available phosphorus, total and mineral nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, oxalate iron and aluminium, and other elements such as manganese and silica), and soil biological activity measurements (e.g., CO2 and N2O emissions).

- 1 Sample registration and preparation
  - Field samples are sent to the lab and registered for tracking by the lab responsible.
  - Sample metadata collected and recorded for each sample: person in charge, project name/ID, sampling period, sampling site, sample type, sampling method, sampling depth, land cover or cropping system, number of samples, individual sample IDs, and analysis requirements.
  - A unique lab ID is created for each sample; a concordance check between field IDs and lab IDs is performed by the sampler and lab technician.
  - A final electronic list with lab-field ID concordance is generated.

- 2 Sample analysis
  - Soil samples for physico-chemical analysis are air-dried, ground, and sieved (2 mm or 0.2 mm) according to the method, then stored.
  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) analysis
    - SOC determined by Walkley and Black (1934) chemical oxidation method followed by redox titration.
    - Mid-Infrared Spectrometry (MIRS) is used on the full sample set; a subset (about one third) is used to develop predictive models for SOC and other properties; the models predict values for the remaining two thirds.
  - Soil texture analysis
    - Chemical analyses on selected samples plus MIRS on the full set.
    - Particle size analysis with removal of organic matter (H2O2 oxidation), dispersion (sodium pyrophosphate), and separation of sand (dry sieving) from silt/clay (pipette method).
    - MIRS is used to develop predictive models for texture values; the models are used to predict remaining samples.
  - Bulk density and Natural 13C abundance (13δ)
    - Bulk density determined from dry weight after removing >2 mm fraction.
    - Natural 13C abundance (13δ) analyzed on selected samples via external specialized lab.
    - MIRS is also used to predict 13δ values from spectral data.
  - Data handling for analyses
    - Subsamples prepared for chemical analyses; spectra and laboratory measurements used to build and apply predictive models.

- 3 Data publication
  - All datasets generated through the described methodology are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
  - Data have been published or are in the process of publication.
  - Examples of associated publications and works include studies on land-use changes and carbon stocks in humid tropical forests of Madagascar, soil organic carbon variability in eastern humid Madagascar, and organic carbon stocks following land-cover change in Madagascar’s rainforest (with several works under review).
