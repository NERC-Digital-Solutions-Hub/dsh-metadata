# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- Aims and scope
  - Documentation of the first step in measuring carbon stocks within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ), Madagascar, under the ESPA p4ges project.
  - Focus on carbon pools: Aboveground biomass (AGB), litter layer, dead wood (standing and lying), soil organic carbon (SOC); builds a basis for all carbon quantification and monitoring across sites.
  - Provides sampling design, field methods, laboratory analyses, data handling, and carbon stock calculations to support policy scrutiny of ecosystem service payments and poverty alleviation strategies.

- Context and project framing
  - Goal: influence development and implementation of payments for ecosystem services at international scale; carbon stock assessment used to inform PES and policy decisions.
  - Structure: WP4 concentrates on carbon assessment across multiple land uses and habitat types within CAZ; generates datasets archived for long-term storage and valorization.

- Zones of interest and land-use framework
  - Zone of Interest (ZOI): four representative zones covering key CAZ conditions (ZOI1 Lakato, ZOI2 Andasibe, ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, ZOI4 Didy).
  - Land uses (LU) defined per Styger et al. 2007: Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty/Degraded land; reforestation identified via NGOs and local communities and included in WP4 sites.
  - Site selection criteria: slope < 45°, transects near habitat centers to minimize edge effects, plots at least 120 m x 120 m, avoid disturbances and streams, minimum 500 m between sites.
  - Sampling intensity: 16 plots per ZOI (4 LU types x 4 replicates); extra plots within each ZOI to capture C stock variability (total sites: 28 in ZOI1, 48 in ZOI2, 28 in ZOI3, 28 in ZOI4).

- Field reconnaissance and sampling design
  - Field reconnaissance: cross-WP verification of site suitability, indicator species, land-use history, accessibility.
  - Minimal representative area: determined via a 1 m x 1 m quadrat inventory, expanding until no new species appeared; established 16 m² as the minimal area for carbon stock quantification.
  - Administrative and field documents: permits, mission orders, insurance; data collection sheets for site characteristics, inventory, Braun-Blanquet cover, sapling/litter/root sampling, soil profiles; field gear and sample bags prepared.

- Plot-level sampling design and data collection
  - General plot design: a central 5 m radius plot employed for biomass and soil sampling; field methods standardized across LU types (with adaptations for degraded land).
  - Closed canopy and fallows
    - Forest inventory: four subplots within a circular area.
      - 2 m radius: sapling inventory (DBH < 5 cm, H > 1.3 m); five randomly selected saplings weighed and sampled.
      - 5 m radius: trees 5–10 cm DBH; measure DBH and height; record local names.
      - 10 m radius: trees 10–20 cm DBH; measure DBH and height; record local names.
      - 20 m radius: trees > 20 cm DBH; measure DBH, height, and local names; standing dead wood details recorded (DBH, height, and wood density category S/I/R).
      - Lying dead wood: 100 m transect; record diameter where transect intersects pieces; note wood density.
    - Aboveground biomass by direct measurement: 54 trees selected by relative contribution to density; felled, weighed by components (trunk, branches, leaves); moisture subsamples collected; dendrometric data recorded.
    - Understorey, litter, and root mat sampling: 25 cm x 25 cm quadrats for litter/root mat; 1 m x 1 m quadrats for understorey vegetation; biomass weighted and lab-sampled.
    - Root description and sampling: 1 m² pit at plot center to classify roots by diameter (<2–10 mm; >10 mm) and describe distribution with soil profile details.
    - Percent cover: indicator species assessed within a 5 m radius using Braun-Blanquet scale (0 to 6).
  - Degraded land (tany maty) or shrub/fallow land
    - No tree inventory due to absence of large trees; biomass sampling, root description, litter, understorey, and soil data collected following the same plot design; data limited to understorey, litter, and soil pools.
  - Soil sampling
    - Conducted at the same points as understorey sampling (points 1–4).
    - Two methods:
      - Soil carbon content: auger sampling at 0–100 cm in 10 cm increments (0–10, 10–20, …, 90–100 cm).
      - Bulk density: cylinder sampling at depths 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, and 80–90 cm in subplots 1–3; moisture samples also collected.
    - Soil profile description: one soil pit per plot center to 1.30 m depth; document horizons, color (Munsell), texture, structure, root density, porosity.
    - Additional site data: GPS coordinates, slope, land-use history.
  - Data handling in the field
    - Field forms scanned and archived; data entered in Excel; photos stored in project data center; data series submitted to Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) for long-term storage.

- Laboratory analyses and data management
  - Biomass analysis
    - Drying: air-dried then oven-dried at 75°C until constant mass; moisture analyses conducted on subsamples.
    - Wood specific gravity (WSG) determined as part of separate manual (WP4-Carbon linkage).
  - Soil analyses
    - Sample preparation: air-dried (≥3 days), sieved to <2 mm; coarse fraction separated; ground to 200 µm for standard analyses.
    - Moisture content: oven-dried at 105°C for 48 hours.
    - Walkley-Black method for soil organic carbon (SOC) as calibration reference; mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) for predictive SOC; δ13C stable isotope analyses performed on selected samples (France) for land-use discrimination and carbon dynamics.
  - Data handling and archiving
    - Field and lab data consolidated into data series; samples tracked with field and lab identifiers; datasets archived at EIDC; lab results linked to field provenance.

- Data processing, carbon stock calculations
  - Aboveground biomass and carbon
    - Allometry: biomass per tree estimated via allometric equations (indirect and direct) using DBH, height, and wood density (WSG); per-tree biomass summed within a plot; scaled to per-hectare densities (Mg ha−1).
    - Carbon stock: convert biomass to carbon using 0.5 conversion factor (C = 0.5 × biomass).
    - Litter, understorey, and root biomass: biomass densities converted to plot-level and then to per-hectare carbon stocks using the same 0.5 factor.
  - Dead wood
    - Lying dead wood: biomass calculated from volume and density using volume formulas for intercepts; biomass per piece aggregated to plot.
    - Standing dead wood: biomass calculated as volume × density; densities assigned by wood condition categories (S, I, R); summation across trees yields plot-level dead wood biomass and carbon.
  - Soil organic carbon (SOC)
    - SOC stock per layer: SOC = Σ (BDi × Ci × (1 − CFi) × ti × 0.1) across layers (0–30 cm or 0–100 cm).
    - Depths considered: SOC30 and SOC100; equivalent mass method applied to standardize SOC stocks across varying bulk densities.
  - Data publication and dissemination
    - Data and key outputs published in scientific papers; data used to inform national soil carbon mapping and carbon stock variability; datasets archived for future dissemination.

- Practical considerations and challenges
  - Data quality and governance
    - Metadata and data provenance are crucial; comprehensive field forms and standardized protocols implemented to facilitate data verification and reuse.
    - Public sharing of datasets is anticipated but can pose barriers; dataset management emphasizes openness at the source and controlled sharing where appropriate.
  - Replication and comparability
    - Zone-based stratification and replicated LU classes ensure representativeness; standardized plot-level design supports cross-site comparability.
  - Integration with broader monitoring
    - Methodologies align with IPCC-inspired pools and Brown/Chave allometric conventions; outputs are designed to feed into longer-term carbon stock monitoring and policy evaluations.

- Key outputs and references
  - Outputs include carbon stock estimates for AGB, litter, dead wood, and SOC across CAZ zones and LU types; data cited in multiple publications and used to advance Madagascar-wide carbon mapping and PES considerations.
