# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- Context: The p4ges project in Madagascar aims to influence payement for ecosystem services at an international scale to alleviate poverty. The CAZ carbon survey (WP4) assesses carbon stocks across five pools (Aboveground biomass, Belowground biomass, Litter, Dead wood, Soil Organic Carbon) and focuses on AGB, litter, deadwood and soil survey. Datasets are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

- Period and people: Field work conducted April 2014 – June 2015; update February 2017. Includes field teams, lab staff, and data management personnel.

- Objective: Establish a first-step, standardized survey design and data handling framework for carbon quantification within a forest ecosystem, to underpin carbon stock assessment and broader mapping efforts.

- Datasets: All data generated by the described methodology archived at EIDC; subsequent analyses referenced in related ESPA publications. Lab analyses and detailed soil methods aligned with Manual n°3; direct biomass measurements linked to allometry and subsequent carbon stock calculations. 

- Key outcomes targeted: A representative, scalable protocol for carbon stock quantification across multiple land uses within CAZ, enabling comparisons over time and integration into larger national-scale carbon assessments.
