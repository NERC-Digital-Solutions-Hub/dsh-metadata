# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Soil_carbon_stock.csv

## Overview
- The dataset presents soil carbon stock importance and sensitivity to land management at two depths: 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm.
- Carbon stocks are provided in equivalent mass (Me) and equivalent volume (Ve), calculated from carbon content generated by a MIRS prediction model.
- Detailed calculations are documented in Manual_1_Classical_Survey.rtf, page 17, section 4.4.
- DOI: https://doi.org/10.5285/c3884aa0-b083-469d-8a0d-fdbbb79aff05
- Context: ESPA programme, P4GES project.
