# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Soil_carbon_stock.csv

## Overview
- Provides soil carbon stock importance and sensitivity to land management for two soil depths: 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm.
- Carbon stocks are presented as both equivalent mass (SOC_Me_30, SOC_Me_100) and equivalent volume (SOC_Ve_30, SOC_Ve_100).
- Stocks are calculated from carbon content generated by a MIRS prediction model.
- Detailed calculation methodology is documented in Manual_1_Classical_Survey.rtf, page 17, section 4.4.
- Associated with ESPA Programme and P4GES project; requires acknowledgement of Laboratoire des Radio Isotopes, Université d'Antananarivo for derived products.

## Access and usage notes
- Data linked to a formal data header with defined variable types and units.
- Calculations rely on an external methodological document; consult Manual_1_Classical_Survey.rtf for detailed procedures.
- Ensure proper citation using the provided DOI and project names; follow acknowledgement requirements.

## Data quality and limitations
- Metadata specifies variable types and units, aiding discoverability and integration.
- Details on data quality, gaps, or harmonization standards are not fully enumerated in the header; refer to the external manual for methodological specifics.
- Users should verify definitions of equivalence (mass vs. volume) as presented in the dataset and documentation.
