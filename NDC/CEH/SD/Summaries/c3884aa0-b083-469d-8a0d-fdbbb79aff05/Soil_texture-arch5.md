- Citation and acknowledgement: Required acknowledgement of Laboratoire des Radio Isotopes, Université d'Antananarivo for products derived from these data.
- Reference materials: Includes explicit guidance to consult Manual_3_ Laboratory_works.rtf for methodological context.

## Access, Sharing, and Publication
- Identifiers: DOI is provided for the dataset.
- Data sharing and publication: Data should be uploaded to relevant portals and catalogued as part of data holdings; ensure proper metadata accompany the dataset for discoverability.
- User needs and usability: Metadata structure and field definitions support discoverability and reuse by researchers requiring granulometric data, with clear categories and units.

## Stewardship, Governance, and Best Practices
- Standards and consistency: Ensure consistent field definitions, categories, and units across datasets; align with the listed Information/Variable Type/Unit schema.
- Data quality: Maintain accuracy and completeness of header metadata; ensure subplot categorization (S1–S4) and granulometric classifications (Clay/Silt/Sand) stay standardized.
- Metadata completeness: Include cross-references to methodological documents (e.g., Manual_3_ Laboratory_works.rtf page 2) and the DOI for traceability.
- Updating and provenance: Document any updates to the header information; preserve provenance notes and acknowledgement requirements in data products.
- Interoperability considerations: The explicit, categorical units and descriptive fields support interoperability across systems and formats, addressing common data governance challenges.
