# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A framework issued by UK funding bodies to ensure research is conducted with high quality processes and credible science.
- Emphasises fitness for purpose, best scientific practice, and accountability from organisations and researchers.
- Applies to a wide range of funded research and includes mechanisms for compliance, monitoring, and documentation.

## Relevance for Data Stewards

- Supports governance of research data by emphasising documented procedures, audit trails, version control, and retention.
- Aligns dataset creation, metadata, and sharing practices with documented planning, risk assessment, and quality assurance.
- Highlights the need for clear roles, competence, and subcontractor management in data-centric projects.
- Encourages formal review, transparency, and evidence-based practices across data handling, storage, and disposal.

## Key Provisions

- 1. Responsibilities
  - The contractor organisation is responsible for overall research quality.
  - Managers and supervisors foster good scientific practice; the Principal Investigator leads all project work, including that of subcontractors.
  - Clear, documented roles and responsibilities for all staff.

- 2. Competence
  - All personnel must be competent; training and supervision are required to protect quality.
  - Contractors must provide evidence of capability and training records.

- 3. Project planning
  - Conduct appropriate risk assessment; maintain a written project plan covering design, statistics, etc.
  - Plans must be agreed with the Funding Body and align with ethical licences where relevant.
  - Regularly review plans; major amendments require pre-approval.

- 4. Quality Control
  - Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality processes.
  - Outputs require senior-level approval; errors post-publication must be reported and corrected promptly.
  - Continual improvement through regular process reviews.

- 5. Health and Safety
  - Full compliance with applicable health and safety regulations.

- 6. Handling of samples and materials
  - Clear, durable labeling; retention periods agreed with the Funding Body.
  - Storage conditions documented and monitored; traceable tracking and defined disposal routes.

- 7. Facilities and equipment
  - Safe working environment; regular calibration and maintenance of equipment.
  - Contingency plans for critical equipment; standard operating procedures for key tools.

- 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
  - All procedures and methods must be documented with audit trails and version control.
  - Validation of methods as fit-for-purpose; traceable modifications.

- 9. Research / work records
  - Records must be detailed enough to enable replication.
  - Regular reviews by the Project Leader; secure, traceable, and protected storage of records.

- 10. Field-based research
  - Compliance with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution.
  - All JCoPR provisions apply to field activities.
