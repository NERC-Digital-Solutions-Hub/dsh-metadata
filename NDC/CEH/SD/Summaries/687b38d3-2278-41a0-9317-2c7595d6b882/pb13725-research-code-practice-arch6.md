# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A multi-agency UK code for research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, and by BBSRC and NERC in their institutes.
- Applies to all types of research; the overriding principle is fitness for purpose.
- Emphasises quality of the research process (QP) and quality of the science (QS); requires competent, adequately trained researchers and best scientific practice.

## Principles behind the Code
- Research quality focus: QP (process quality) and QS (scientific quality).
- QP underpins reliable, auditable, and repeatable results; QS covers aims, approaches, and new knowledge.
- Commitment to best scientific practice from the top of funded organisations; all activities should be diligent and fit for purpose.

## Compliance with the Code
- Contractors indicate acceptance in funding proposals; discussions about inapplicable clauses can occur and become part of terms and conditions.
- Contractors must ensure project and subcontractor compliance with JCoPR.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director.

## Monitoring of Compliance with the Code
- Organisations should have policies/processes to ensure compliance, ideally audited by a third party to an appropriate standard.
- Funding Bodies may audit funded projects or contractor systems; UKAS audits previously conducted (Defra/FSA).

## 1. Responsibilities
- The contracting organisation is responsible for overall research quality and internal policies.
- Managers and supervisors promote good scientific practice; clearly defined staff roles and responsibilities.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader accountable for all project work, including subcontractors.

## 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; training supervised to prevent quality issues.
- Documented evidence of capability and training; CVs and training records maintained.

## 3. Project Planning
- Conduct risk assessment and develop a written project plan addressing design, statistics, ethical/licensing requirements.
- Regular reviews of timetables; significant amendments pre-approved by the Funding Body.

## 4. Quality Control
- Planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes; formal reviews at appropriate frequency.
- Outputs require funding body approval; post-publication errors must be reported with corrective action.
- Continuous improvement through regular review of processes.

## 5. Health and Safety
- All work must comply with relevant Health and Safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of Samples and Materials
- Clear, durable labeling; retention periods agreed with the Funding Body.
- Storage conditions monitored and recorded; track samples through analysis; defined disposal routes.

## 7. Facilities and Equipment
- Safe, appropriate working environment; regular maintenance of facilities (e.g., fume cupboards) and equipment.
- Equipment calibrated and fit for measurement; contingency plans for disruptions; SOPs for critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of Procedures and Methods
- All procedures and methods documented with audit trails, version control, and linkages to primary data.
- Validation procedures to ensure methods are fit for purpose; traceable modifications.

## 9. Research / Work Records
- Records must be detailed enough to replicate work; regular reviews of staff records by the Project Leader.
- Clear retention and security of critical data; records stored in accessible, unalterable form.

## 10. Field-based Research
- Compliance with environmental legislation; management of discharges/emissions to minimize pollution.
- All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based research as appropriate.

## Annex – Examples of Documentary Evidence
- Sections include responsibilities, personnel competence, project planning, quality control, health & safety, handling of samples & materials, facilities & equipment, documentation & methods, research/work records, and field-based research, with specific evidence such as org charts, CVs, training records, risk assessments, SOPs, logging and archiving procedures, and other corroborating documents.
