# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A governance framework for research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, BBSRC, and NERC.
- Aims to ensure fitness for purpose, quality of research processes (QP) and quality of science (QS), and the use of best scientific practice from project start to finish.
- Applies to all types of research funded by the listed bodies and to in-house research at funding bodies’ institutes; emphasis on auditor-friendly, auditable, and repeatable work.

## Relevance for GIS Specialists

- Guides the creation of map-based data products with clear provenance, metadata, and auditable workflows.
- Encourages end-user involvement, risk assessment, and regular reviews to ensure spatial analyses meet objectives and are reproducible.
- Highlights data management, documentation, and quality control practices critical for GIS projects (integration of datasets, varying resolutions, and data standards).

## Principles behind the Code (core concepts)

- Quality of Process (QP): robust, auditable procedures; repeatable methods; appropriate safeguards.
- Quality of Science (QS): aims, methods, and knowledge extraction are sound.
- Fitness for purpose: decisions and practices should align with the intended use of results.
- Leadership commitment: compliance should be driven from the top of funded organisations.

## Compliance and Monitoring

- Contractors indicate acceptance of the Code when applying for funding; discussions about inappropriate clauses may occur.
- Annual acceptance by Institute Directors for BBSRC/NERC-funded work.
- Organizations are responsible for ensuring subcontractors follow JCoPR.
- Monitoring includes formal systems audited by third parties where possible; funding bodies may audit contractor systems to verify standards.

## 1. Responsibilities

- The contracting organisation owns overall research quality and policy compliance.
- Managers and supervisors cultivate good scientific practice.
- The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for all project work, including subcontractors; clear roles and responsibilities for all staff.

## 2. Competence

- All personnel must be competent for their technical, scientific, and support tasks.
- Training and supervision must ensure quality and safety.
- Documented evidence of competence and training is required.

## 3. Project Planning

- Conduct risk assessment to identify factors affecting success and objectives.
- Maintain a written project plan agreed with the Funding Body; consider ethics approvals and licences as applicable.
- Schedule regular timetable reviews; pre-approve significant plan amendments with the Funding Body.

## 4. Quality Control

- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes.
- Outputs require senior-level authorization; post-publication errors must be reported to the Funding Body with corrective actions.
- Commit to continual improvement through regular process reviews.

## 5. Health and Safety

- Compliance with applicable health and safety regulations is mandatory for all research activities.

## 6. Handling of Samples and Materials

- Clear, durable labeling and tracking of samples/materials; maintain storage conditions per project plans.
- Define disposal routes and retention periods; ensure traceability through all stages of analysis or use.

## 7. Facilities and Equipment

- Safe, appropriate working environment; regular maintenance of facilities and equipment; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Instruments must be calibrated and suitable for measurements; maintain standard operating procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of Procedures and Methods

- All procedures and methods must be documented with an auditable trail (document/version control).
- Include analytical and statistical procedures; ensure methods are validated and modifications traceable.

## 9. Research / Work Records

- Records must be detailed enough to allow replication; regular reviews by the Project Leader.
- Clearly locate and securely retain critical data and records for a period agreed with the Funding Body; ensure data integrity and protection against unauthorized modification.

## 10. Field-Based Research

- Compliance with environmental legislation for fieldwork.
- Manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution risks.
- All field provisions apply in addition to the general JCoPR requirements.

## Annex – Examples of Documentary Evidence

- 1. Responsibilities: organisation chart, personnel lists (including subcontractors), documented sub-contractor agreements, roles/responsibilities.
- 2. Personnel Competence: CVs, up-to-date training records, awareness of Code provisions.
- 3. Project Planning: risk assessments, regular plan reviews, approved project plan with milestones, statistical validation, sampling procedures, ethical approvals/licences.
- 4. Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews, audits and corrective actions, publication authorization policy.
- 5. Health & Safety: training/compliance documentation (e.g., Lab Health & Safety Plan), specific measures for hazardous materials.
- 6. Handling Samples & Materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures for handling, updated storage logs.
- 7. Facilities & Equipment: maintenance/calibration records, regular facility maintenance, SOPs for critical equipment; emergency procedures.
- 8. Documentation & Methods: robust document/version control; validated SOPs.
- 9. Research/Work Records: counter-signed notebooks or indexed data files; consistent archiving procedures.
- 10. Field-Based Research: documented risk assessments for field work.
