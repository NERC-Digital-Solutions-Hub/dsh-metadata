# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- Purpose: A framework to ensure the quality of the research process (QP) and the quality of the science (QS) across projects funded by UK funding bodies, with emphasis on fitness for purpose, competency, and diligent conduct from inception.

- Scope and governance: Applies to research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, and by BBSRC/NERC in their own institutes; endorsed by devolved governments and other agencies. Acceptance of the Code is required in funding proposals; annual acceptance for BBSRC/NERC-funded work; may involve risk assessments and consideration of ethical/licence requirements.

- Monitoring and assurance: Bodies expect formal, auditable systems to assure quality of research processes, potentially verified by independent audits (e.g., UKAS). The aim is consistent application of policies across organisations.

- Core principles: 
  - Fitness-for-purpose: every activity should be judged by its aim and appropriateness.
  - Best scientific practice: competent and adequately trained researchers conduct work from the outset.
  - Top-down commitment: leadership within funded organisations drives compliance.

- Key requirements (overview):
  - 1. Responsibilities: contractor orgs hold overall quality; managers promote good scientific practice; Principal Investigator oversees all project work, including subcontractors; clear roles defined for staff.
  - 2. Competence: all personnel must be competent; training supervised; evidence of capability and safety awareness maintained.
  - 3. Project planning: conduct risk assessment; produce written project plans addressing design, statistics, ethics/licences; regular timetable reviews; pre-approval for significant amendments.
  - 4. Quality Control: planned processes to assure quality; formal fit-for-purpose reviews; outputs authorised by funding body; post-publication corrections managed; continual improvement.
  - 5. Health and Safety: compliance with relevant regulations.
  - 6. Handling of samples and materials: clear, durable labelling; defined storage, tracking, disposal; linkage to project plan; appropriate handling.
  - 7. Facilities and equipment: safe, appropriate environment; regular calibration and maintenance; contingency plans; standard operating procedures for critical equipment.
  - 8. Documentation of procedures and methods: full documentation and audit trail; version control; validated procedures; traceability of method development.
  - 9. Research/work records: high-quality records enabling replication; regular reviews by Project Leader; secure, traceable storage of records.
  - 10. Field-based research: compliance with environmental laws; risk management for discharges/emissions; application of all JCoPR provisions to field work.

- Annex: Examples of documentary evidence (evidence required categories)
  - 1. Responsibilities: organogram; personnel lists; subcontractor agreements; defined roles.
  - 2. Personnel competence: CVs; training records; awareness evidence.
  - 3. Project planning: risk records; review logs; approved project plans; statistical validation; sampling procedures; ethics/licences.
  - 4. Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews; internal audits and corrective actions; publication policy.
  - 5. Health & safety: training/compliance documentation; safety plans for hazards.
  - 6. Handling of samples & materials: standardized labelling/tracking; procedures; storage logs.
  - 7. Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records; facility upkeep; SOPs for critical equipment.
  - 8. Documentation of procedures & methods: robust document/version control; validated SOPs.
  - 9. Research/work records: counter-signed logs or indexed data files; archiving procedures.
  - 10. Field-based research: documented risk assessments and countermeasures.

- Background and evolution: Originated from a collaboration among BBSRC, Defra, FSA, and NERC; later endorsed by NI, Scotland, Wales, and additional agencies. Launched May 2003; effective June 1, 2004; UKAS audits conducted starting 2006; revised in light of audits and stakeholder input.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks authors:
  - Establishes a rigorous governance and quality assurance model for environmental health monitoring projects.
  - Emphasizes metadata, data management, transparency, and auditable processes.
  - Highlights data sharing considerations, risk assessment, and formal governance to ensure data and findings are robust, traceable, and fit for purpose.
