# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A framework for the proper conduct of research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, and by BBSRC/NERC in their own institutes.
- Emphasises fitness-for-purpose (quality of the research process and quality of science) and requires researchers to be competent and adequately trained.
- Applies to all types of research, with principles read in the context of each project.

## Principles behind the Code

- Focus on two linked quality dimensions:
  - Quality of the research process (QP): rigour, repeatability, auditable methods.
  - Quality of the science (QS): aims, approaches, knowledge extraction.
- Promote best scientific practice from the start; ownership from the top of funded organisations.
- Research should be conducted diligently by competent, properly trained researchers.
- Compliance is tied to project proposals, contracts, and ongoing governance.

## Compliance with the Code

- Contractors must indicate acceptance when submitting research proposals; discussions on inapplicable clauses may be recorded as part of contract terms.
- Funding bodies may require risk assessments and ensure subcontractors comply with JCoPR.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director is required.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code

- Organisations should have policies and processes to ensure compliance, ideally with formal third-party audited quality systems against an appropriate standard.
- Funding bodies may audit contractors’ research systems if needed (historically via UKAS in 2006).

## 1. Responsibilities

- The contractor organisation is responsible for overall research quality and policy compliance.
- Managers and supervisors foster good scientific practice and skill development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader oversees all work, including that of subcontractors; clear roles for all staff.

## 2. Competence

- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; trainees must be supervised to preserve quality.
- Contractors must provide evidence of capability and maintain training records.

## 3. Project planning

- Conduct risk assessments to understand factors affecting success.
- Produce a clear written project plan addressing design, statistics, and ethical/licence considerations; agree it with the Funding Body.
- Schedule regular plan reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.

## 4. Quality Control

- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality reviews at appropriate frequency.
- Outputs require funding-body-approved authorization; notify and correct post-publication errors promptly.
- Pursue continual improvement through regular process evaluation.

## 5. Health and Safety

- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of samples and materials

- Label samples clearly, uniquely, durably; retain for an agreed period.
- Storage conditions must be specified, monitored, and recorded when critical.
- Track samples through analysis and disposal pathways.

## 7. Facilities and equipment

- Work environment must support safe operation and data integrity.
- Critical equipment must be calibrated and maintained; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods

- Document all procedures and methods; maintain audit trails, version control, and link secondary data to primary data.
- Validate methods for fitness-for-purpose; trace modifications through development.

## 9. Research / work records

- Records must be detailed enough to reproduce work; regular reviews by the Project Leader.
- Locate and secure all critical data; retain records in a form ensuring integrity and security for an agreed period.

## 10. Field-based research

- Comply with environmental legislation; manage discharges/emissions to minimise pollution risks.
- Apply all JCoPR provisions to field-based research.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence

- 1. Responsibilities: org chart, personnel lists (including sub-contractors), sub-contractor agreements, roles/responsibilities.
- 2. Personnel competence: CVs, up-to-date training records, awareness of JCoPR obligations.
- 3. Project planning: risk assessments, regular timetable/plan reviews, approved project plan with milestones, statistical validation, sampling procedures, ethical/licence documentation.
- 4. Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews, audits and corrective actions, publication policy and authorisation procedures.
- 5. Health & safety: training/compliance documentation, specific safety measures for hazards.
- 6. Handling of samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures, storage logs.
- 7. Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records, facility maintenance, SOPs for critical equipment, emergency procedures.
- 8. Documentation of procedures & methods: robust document/version control, validated SOPs.
- 9. Research/work records: consistent hard/soft copy storage, counter-signed notebooks or indexed data, archiving procedures.
- 10. Field-based research: documented risk assessment for field work and proactive risk mitigation.
