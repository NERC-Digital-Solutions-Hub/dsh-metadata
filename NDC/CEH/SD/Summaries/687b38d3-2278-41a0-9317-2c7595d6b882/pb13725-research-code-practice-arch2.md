# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Background
- Developed by a coalition of UK research and funding bodies (BBSRC, Defra, FSA, NERC) and endorsed by devolution administrations and other agencies.
- Launched in May 2003; effect from 1 June 2004.
- Defra and FSA conducted a joint audit program from 2006; UKAS audits of selected projects followed.
- Revised by Defra and FSA with input from BBSRC, NERC, and devolution administrations; applies to funded and some in-house research; emphasis on fitness for purpose.

## Purpose and Scope
- Sets a framework for proper conduct of research to ensure fitness for purpose, quality of process (QP) and quality of science (QS).
- Applies to research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, and to BBSRC/NERC-funded work in their own institutes.
- Aims to promote best scientific practice, with responsibilities resting on funded organizations and researchers.

## Key Principles
- QP (quality of the process) and QS (quality of the science) are both essential.
- Research should be diligent, competent, and adequately trained.
- Compliance is driven from the top of funded organizations.
- “Fitness for purpose” guides all provisions and judgements.

## Compliance, Monitoring and Audits
- Contractors must indicate acceptance of the Code when applying for funding; discussions about applicability may be recorded as part of terms and conditions.
- Projects may require formal risk assessments; contractors must ensure subcontractors comply with the Code.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director is required.
- Monitoring relies on formal, auditable systems (often third-party) and may include independent audits of the contractor’s research system.

## Responsibilities
- The contractor organization: overall quality of research and compliance with in-house policies.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors: foster good scientific practice and skill development.
- Principal Investigator/Project Leader: responsible for all project work, including that of subcontractors; clear roles and responsibilities for all staff.

## Competence
- All project personnel must be competent to perform required tasks.
- Training must be supervised to prevent quality compromise.
- Contractors must provide documented evidence of capability and keep training records.

## Project Planning
- Conduct risk assessments to identify factors affecting success and objective attainment.
- Maintain a clear, written project plan addressing design, statistics, licencing, ethical approvals, etc.
- Plans should be agreed with the Funding Body; schedule regular reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.

## Quality Control
- Implement planned quality assurance processes with fit-for-purpose reviews at appropriate frequencies.
- Output authorization by the Funding Body; senior approval as needed.
- Notify Funding Body of post-publication errors and initiate corrective action promptly.
- Commit to continual improvement through regular process reviews.

## Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

## Handling of Samples and Materials
- Clear, durable labeling; retention periods defined with the Funding Body.
- Storage and handling plans must be specified and monitored if critical.
- Samples must be traceable through analysis and disposal routes.

## Facilities and Equipment
- Safe working environment; regular maintenance of facilities and equipment (e.g., fume cupboards).
- Equipment must be suitable, calibrated, and maintained; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment.

## Documentation of Procedures and Methods
- All procedures must be documented with audit trails, version controls, and traceability to primary data.
- Procedures for method validation and traceable modifications must be in place.

## Research / Work Records
- Records must enable replication; project leader ensures ongoing validity.
- Record locations and integrity must be documented; retention periods defined with the Funding Body.

## Field-based Research
- Must comply with relevant environmental legislation.
- Laboratories must manage discharges and emissions to minimise pollution; Code provisions apply to fieldwork as well.

## Annex: Examples of Documentary Evidence (Evidence Requirements Snapshot)
- Responsibilities: organization structure, personnel lists (including sub-contractors), documented roles, sub-contractor adherence agreements.
- Personnel Competence: CVs, training records, awareness of Code requirements.
- Project Planning: risk assessments, updated plans, milestone records, validated procedures, ethical approvals.
- Quality Control: internal audit records, fit-for-purpose reviews, publication authorization policies.
- Health & Safety: training/compliance documentation (e.g., Health & Safety Plans).
- Handling of Samples & Materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures, storage logs.
- Facilities & Equipment: maintenance/calibration records, SOPs, contingency planning.
- Documentation & Methods: robust document/version control, validated SOPs.
- Research/Work Records: counter-signed records, secure archiving, both hard and electronic storage as appropriate.
- Field-based Research: documented risk assessments for field activities.

## Takeaway for Environment Monitoring Analysts
- Ensures data quality, traceability, and consistent reporting across environmental monitoring projects.
- Mandates formal planning, risk assessment, clear responsibilities, and ongoing competence.
- Emphasizes auditability, data integrity, and robust data and sample management from field to publication.
- Supports transparent sharing of underlying data and methods while maintaining compliance with safety and environmental regulations.
