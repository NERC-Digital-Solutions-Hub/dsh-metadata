# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- The Code is a collaborative framework developed by UK funding bodies (e.g., BBSRC, Defra, FSA, NERC) and endorsed by devolved administrations and other agencies. It applies to research funded by these bodies and to research conducted in their institutes. It aims to ensure fitness for purpose, emphasizing both the quality of the research process (QP) and the quality of the science (QS).
- It emphasizes that contractors must implement best scientific practice from the start, with compliance driven from organizational leadership, and that the Code should be read with emphasis on fitness for purpose.

## Principles behind the Code

- QP (quality of the process) and QS (quality of the science) are both essential; QP ensures rigorous, repeatable, auditable methods and processes.
- Compliance is expected to be embedded from the top of funded organizations.
- Contractors should demonstrate appropriate precautions and competence; research should be diligently conducted with trained personnel.
- The overarching principle is fitness for purpose.

## Compliance with the Code

- Contractors indicate acceptance when submitting proposals and may discuss potentially inapplicable clauses with the Funding Body; such discussions may become part of the funding terms.
- Contractors must ensure projects (and subcontractors) comply with the JCoPR.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director is required.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code

- Organizations should have policies and processes to ensure compliance, ideally supported by a formal, third-party audit against an international standard.
- The Funding Bodies may audit funded projects or contractor research systems to verify adherence.

## Specific requirements of the Code

### 1. Responsibilities
- The contractor is responsible for overall research quality and compliance with in-house policies.
- Managers and supervisors promote good scientific practice; the Principal Investigator (PI) or Project Leader is responsible for all project work, including subcontractors.

### 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; training must be supervised to prevent quality compromise.
- Contractors must provide documented evidence of capability and training records.

### 3. Project planning
- Conduct appropriate risk assessment; develop a clear written project plan addressing design, statistical methods, etc.
- Plans should be agreed with the Funding Body; regular timetable reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.

### 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality reviews; outputs require authorization by the Funding Body or senior management.
- Notify and correct post-publication errors; pursue continual improvement of processes.

### 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

### 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Label, track, and store samples/materials clearly; retain them as agreed with the Funding Body.
- Monitoring of critical storage conditions; define disposal routes and dates.

### 7. Facilities and equipment
- Safe working environment; regular maintenance and calibration of equipment; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment.

### 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- Document all procedures and methods; maintain audit trails with version control; link secondary data to primary data.
- Validate methods as fit for purpose; trace modifications through development.

### 9. Research / work records
- Records must be detailed enough to allow replication; regular reviews by the Project Leader.
- Locate and securely store all project records; ensure integrity and prevent unauthorized modification; retain for the agreed period.

### 10. Field-based research
- Comply with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution; apply all JCoPR provisions to fieldwork.
