# Vascular plant and bryophyte survey from a 33-year chronosequence on bare chalk, Dorset, 2019-2020

## Aim and study context
- Investigates primary succession on bare chalk across a 33-year chronosequence.
- Focuses on two taxa: vascular plants and bryophytes.
- Location: Down Farm, north Dorset, England (archaeological excavation site with a mosaic of bare chalk surfaces).
- Chronology established through a sequence of excavation ages (1986, 2004–2008, 2013–2018; two blocks in 2016).
- No chemical input or biomass removal on sites; provides a long-term view of colonisation processes.

## Survey method
- 13 transects established in July 2019, one per excavated block.
- Transect length: 16 meters.
- Vascular plants: recorded as percent cover in 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats, every 1 meter along each transect (total of 208 quadrats).
  - Species identified to full scientific name; Taraxacum microspecies as an exception.
- Bryophytes: recorded in February 2020 using 20 cm × 20 cm quadrats (more appropriate for bryophytes).
  - Species identified to full scientific name; where necessary, microscopy; some small/infertile specimens classified to groups.
- Exclusions:
  - Bryophyte data missing for two plots (excavated 2006 due to rubble; excavated 2016 due to time constraints).
- Data collectors: experienced field ecologists.
- Data management: paper forms digitised into Excel; checked for anomalies.

## Data structure and contents
- Two primary data files:
  - Vascular_plant_survey_bare_chalk_Dorset.csv
  - Bryophyte_survey_bare_chalk_Dorset.csv
- Vascular plant data structure (example columns):
  - Plot_number, Year_exc (year excavated: 1986–2018), Quadrat_number (0–15), Unique_ID (Plot_Quadrat), Survey_date, species columns with percentage cover per quadrat, Bare_chalk, Bare_soil, Bare_chalk&soil, etc.; sward_height and total cover metrics available.
- Bryophyte data structure:
  - Plot_number, Year_exc, Quadrat_number, Unique_ID, Survey_date, species columns with percentage cover, plus Bare_chalk, Bare_soil, Stones, Flint, Total_bare_grd, etc.
- Both datasets are organized at the quadrat level across all 13 transects and multiple excavation ages, enabling temporal and spatial analyses of colonisation patterns.

## Data quality and provenance
- Data collected by experienced ecologists; rigorous field methods.
- Data were digitised and checked for anomalies to ensure reliability.
- Bryophyte identifications confirmed via microscopy where required; some taxa limited to groups when specimens were small or infertile.

## Outputs, usage, and accessibility
- Data are structured for self-serve analysis of species composition, cover, and bare ground dynamics across time and space.
- Provides a ready-to-use basis for examining primary succession trajectories of vascular plants and bryophytes on bare chalk.
- References for broader context and detailed findings are linked in the document (see below).

## Notes and caveats
- Two bryophyte plots missing data due to practical constraints (rubble and time); these gaps should be considered in analyses.
- Taxonomic resolution is high for most taxa, with minor exceptions noted in the bryophyte dataset.
