# Vascular plant and bryophyte survey from a 33-year chronosequence on bare chalk, Dorset, 2019-2020

## Aim and context
- Investigates primary succession on bare chalk through a 33-year chronosequence at Down Farm, north Dorset.
- Targets two taxa: vascular plants and bryophytes.
- Builds on long-term archaeological excavations (1986; 2004–2008; 2013–2018) creating a mosaic of bare chalk surfaces that have been unmanaged (no chemical input or biomass removal).
- Links to broader work on succession patterns, colonisation of exposed chalk, and chalk grassland restoration.

## Survey design and methods
- 13 transects set up in July 2019, one per excavated block corresponding to ages: 1986, 2004–2008, 2013–2018 (two blocks in 2016).
- Each transect is 16 m long; along each transect, 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats recorded every 1 m for a total of 208 quadrats.
- Vascular plants: identified to species level (except Taraxacum microspecies).
- Bryophytes: surveyed February 2020 using 20 cm × 20 cm quadrats; two bryophyte plots excluded due to rubble (1986 block) and time constraints (2016 block).
- Both taxa: field data collected by experienced ecologists; data sheets digitised into Excel and checked for anomalies.

## Data collected and taxa
- Vascular plant data: per-quadrat percentage cover for all vascular species (full scientific names) along with site-related metrics.
- Bryophyte data: per-quadrat percentage cover for bryophyte species (with species-level IDs where possible) and occasional grouping for small/infertile specimens.
- Environmental/cover metrics included in both datasets (e.g., bare chalk, bare soil, stones, flint, total bare ground).

## Data structure and file formats
- Datasets available as two CSV files:
  - Vascular_plant_survey_bare_chalk_Dorset.csv
  - Bryophyte_survey_bare_chalk_Dorset.csv
- Vascular dataset structure (illustrative columns):
  - Plot_number (1-13), Year_exc (1986–2018), Quadrat_number (0–15), Unique_ID (Plot_Quadrat), Survey_date, species columns (full scientific names with percentage cover)
  - Additional environmental columns (e.g., Bare_chalk, Bare_soil, Bare_chalk&soil)
- Bryophyte dataset structure (illustrative columns):
  - Plot_number, Year_exc, Quadrat_number, Unique_ID, Survey_date
  - Species columns with percentage cover, plus environmental columns (e.g., Bare_chalk, Bare_soil, Stones, Flint, Total_bare_grd)

## Quality control
- Data collected by experienced field ecologists.
- Paper records digitised into Excel and checked for anomalies.

## Data access and availability
- Data are provided as two clearly defined CSV datasets with explicit column definitions.
- Filenames and structure support discoverability and reuse.
- The document does not specify licensing, repository location, or update cadence.

## Limitations and considerations for use
- Bryophyte dataset excludes two plots (1986 rubble; 2016 time constraint) limiting full comparability across all ages.
- Taxonomic resolution: vascular plants mostly species-level (Taraxacum microspecies excluded); bryophytes mostly species-level with some groupings for small/infertile specimens.
- Temporal coverage reflects fieldsurvey years (historic excavations via chronosequence plus 2019–2020 survey window); not all plots may have uniform year sampling.
- Metadata is detailed for structure and content, but broader data governance details (licensing, repository, versioning) are not specified.
