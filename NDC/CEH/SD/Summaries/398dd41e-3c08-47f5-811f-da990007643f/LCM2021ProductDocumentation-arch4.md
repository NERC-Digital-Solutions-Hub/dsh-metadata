# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2021

- Purpose and scope
  - User guide for UKCEH Land Cover Map 2021 (LCM2021), an annual land cover product.
  - LCM2021 consists of six geospatial datasets (three per region: Great Britain and Northern Ireland): 10 m Classified Pixel dataset, Land Parcel dataset, and 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset; plus 1 km summary products derived from 25 m rasters.
  - Aims to help users understand data production, validation, and accuracy to support informed decision-making and ongoing data use.

- Data structure and content
  - UKCEH Land Cover Classes: 21 classes based on Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats; detailed relationships and notes provided to preserve comparability with earlier products.
  - Datasets and formats
    - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets: per classification scene mosaic; first band = most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class; second band = class membership probability.
    - Land Parcel datasets: generated by intersecting 10 m pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework; include parcel-level attributes.
    - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets: rasterised per parcel with three bands (dominant class, mean confidence, and purity).
    - 1 km products: summarized from 25 m rasters to provide dominant class and percentage cover for each class and aggregate class (with rounding considerations near coastlines).
  - Spatial scope and coordinates
    - Great Britain: British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).
    - Northern Ireland: Irish Grid TM75 (EPSG: 29903).
  - Land parcels and resolution
    - Land Parcel Spatial Framework uses a minimum area of approximately 0.5 ha (minimum mappable unit).
    - 10 m pixel data preserve fine landscape detail; 25 m rasters aggregate to parcel-level statistics; 1 km products offer coarse-grained summaries.

- Production methodology
  - Seasonal Composite Images
    - Derived from Google Earth Engine; Sentinel-2 spectral data resampled to 10 m; four seasonal composites (Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec) using 10 Sentinel-2 bands.
    - Occasional data gaps are handled; classifier tolerates partial spectral information.
  - Context Rasters
    - 10 m context rasters used to reduce spectral confusion (GB: height, aspect, slope; distance to buildings, roads, sea, freshwater; foreshore and tidal water masks; woodland mask).
    - NI uses height, aspect, slope, urban mask, coast, freshwater, road distances, foreshore and tidal masks.
  - Classification Scenes and Tile System
    - GB classified in 32 Classification Scenes, aligned to a modified OS 100 x 100 km tile grid; scenes trained and classified independently to manage regional phenology and data volume.
    - NI uses a single 49-band Classification Scene combining a 40-band Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite with NI context rasters.
  - Bootstrap Training and Random Forest
    - Bootstrap Training: automatic training data derived from historical maps (LCM2018–LCM2020) with high-purity parcels to bootstrap classifier training.
    - Random Forest classifier trained with at least 10,000 samples per bag; balanced sampling to ensure rare classes are adequately learned.
  - UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
    - Framework created to aggregate 10 m pixels into coherent land parcels; framework enhanced for faster processing; unique parcel identifiers (gid) may differ from LCM2015 for cross-map comparisons.
  - Validation and accuracy
    - Validation dataset: 35,182 points across all 21 classes.
    - Overall accuracy: 82.6% (95% CI 82.19%–82.99%).
    - Appendix 4 provides class-level user’s and producer’s accuracies and confusion matrices.

- Class relationships and guidance
  - UKCEH Land Cover Classes vs. UK BAP Broad Habitats
    - Classes are aligned with BAP Broad Habitats but not identical; some BAP categories are split or merged to enhance remote-sensing mapping.
    - Appendices describe the mapping between UKCEH classes, UK BAP Broad Habitats, and aggregate classes, including notes on specific splits (e.g., Heather vs. Heather Grassland; Urban vs. Suburban; Saltwater vs. Freshwater handling).
  - Appendix resources
    - Appendix 1: Notes on UKCEH Land Cover Classes (interpretation guidance and training data considerations).
    - Appendix 2: Summary of BAP Broad Habitats definitions.
    - Appendix 3–5: Dataset lists, dataset names, and color recipes for displaying classes.
    - Appendix 6: Color-blind friendly display recipes.

- Data quality, limitations, and usage notes
  - The 10 m Classified Pixels are not generalized by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework, preserving fine-scale features; accuracy validation was performed against the 25 m Land Parcel dataset.
  - Seasonal gaps may occur due to cloud cover; the classification framework is designed to tolerate incomplete spectral information.
  - Some inter-class confusion is expected (notably among upland, peat, and related habitats) due to spectral similarity and the inherent differences between remote-sensing signals and field-based habitat definitions.
  - The annual update approach supports change detection by differentiating persistent real changes from random classification noise.

- Temporal cadence and governance implications for data leaders
  - Annual production maximizes temporal consistency and enables robust change detection over time; expected to differentiate real land-cover changes from random errors.
  - Bootstrap Training creates a scalable, low-input training workflow by leveraging historical maps; essential to maintain accuracy as data streams evolve.
  - Clear metadata, documentation, and versioning are critical given cross-map comparability (e.g., parcel identifiers may differ from LCM2015).
  - Data management considerations include complex dependencies across:
    - Sentinel-2 seasonal composites and context rasters
    - Land Parcel Spatial Framework and MMU
    - GB NI-specific classification scenes
  - Validated accuracy at 82.6% suggests the product is robust for policy-support, environmental monitoring, and land-cover change analyses, while users should account for class-specific limitations and potential misclassifications in nuanced habitats.
