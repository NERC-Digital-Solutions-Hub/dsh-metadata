# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2021

## Overview
- LCM2021 is the ninth UK land cover map produced by UKCEH, comprising six datasets: three for Great Britain and three for Northern Ireland, including 10 m classified pixel data, corresponding land parcel datasets, and 25 m rasterised land parcel data; plus 1 km products derived from the 25 m data.
- The map uses 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes, aligned to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats but not identical to them. The document clarifies relationships and naming conventions between UKCEH classes and BAP habitats.
- Formal validation reports an overall thematic accuracy of 82.6%.

## Data Production and Structure
- Data are generated from Classification Scenes that combine Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images with 10 Context Rasters to reduce spectral confusion.
- Seasonal Composite Images are derived from four seasons using Sentinel-2 data, processed in Google Earth Engine; occasional cloud gaps are accommodated.
- Context Rasters include terrain (Height, Aspect, Slope) and proximity metrics (distance to buildings, roads, sea, freshwater) plus coastal/foreshore masks and land-use masks.
- Classification Scenes are tile-based (GB uses a grid of ~100 x 100 km tiles; NI uses a single scene). About 32 GB scenes cover GB; NI uses 49-band configuration for the scene.
- Bootstrap Training is used to train a Random Forest classifier. It automatically samples training data from historic maps (LCM2018–LCM2020) with >80% purity, ensuring balanced class representation by sampling with replacement.
- The 10 m Classified Pixel dataset preserves fine landscape features by not generalising to the Land Parcel Spatial Framework (MMU ~0.5 ha). The 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets are generated by intersecting 10 m pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to create parcel-level attributes.

## Datasets and Product Details
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI): two-band rasters per pixel — the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class and the associated classification confidence.
- Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI): attach 10 m pixel results to the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework; parcels include attributes such as hist, mode, purity, conf, stdev, agg, n.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI): three-band rasters per parcel — dominant land cover (_mode), confidence (_conf), and purity (_purity).
- 1 km raster products: summaries including dominant class and percentage cover for both the 21 classes and 10 aggregate classes.
- Seasonal Composite Images: four-season Sentinel-2 reflectance composites (10 m resolution) with 50-band inputs; occasional gaps represented by nulls.
- Context Rasters: GB uses 10 context rasters (terrain plus road/building/coast/freshwater/woodland masks); NI uses a similar set with NI-specific masks.
- UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework: framework to generalise land parcels, with MMU ~0.5 ha; gid identifiers may not match earlier datasets, affecting direct parcel-wise comparisons across releases.

## Validation and Accuracy
- Validation used 35,182 reference points across all 21 classes, drawing from GB countryside survey data, National Forest Inventory data, Rural Payments data, and bespoke validation points.
- Reported overall accuracy: 82.6% (95% CI 82.19%–82.99%).
- Appendix provides per-class accuracy assessments (producer and user accuracies) to understand class-level performance.

## Interpretation, Use and Limitations
- The 10 m Classified Pixel data provide high-detail mapping suitable for specialist use; users should note that accuracy validation is against the 25 m Land Parcel dataset, not the 10 m pixel layer.
- The 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are anchored to BAP Broad Habitats but are not identical; where needed, BAP terms are italicised to reduce ambiguity. Appendices 1–2 offer detailed mapping notes.
- Annual production aims to improve temporal consistency and facilitate change detection; random classification errors are expected to flicker over time, whereas real changes persist.
- Some spectral confusions persist (e.g., between certain grasslands, bracken, fen/bog, and coastal/rock types). Context rasters and seasonal information are used to mitigate these issues.

## Accessibility and Colour Schemes
- Dataset names and official holdings are listed in Appendix 3; coordinates use GB British National Grid (EPSG:27700) and NI Irish Grid (EPSG:29903).
- Appendix 5 and Appendix 6 provide recommended colour schemes (including colour-blind friendly versions) for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes.

## Notable Definitions and Context
- Bootstrap Training: automatic training data selection from historic maps to train a Random Forest without new field data, enabling continual updates.
- Land Parcel Spatial Framework: designed to represent discrete land units (approx. 0.5 ha MMU) to reduce classification noise and enable change detection.
- Classification Scene: multi-layer input used by the classifier, combining spectral (Seasonal Composite) and contextual information.
