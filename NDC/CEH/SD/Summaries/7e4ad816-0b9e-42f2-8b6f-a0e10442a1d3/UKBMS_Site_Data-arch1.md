# Experimental design/sampling regime

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) collects data from over 2,000 sites per year across the UK, using multiple standardized methods to monitor butterfly abundance.

- All-species transects (Pollard walks):
  - Fixed-route line transects where all butterflies are recorded weekly under specified weather conditions.
  - Transects are 2–4 km long, divided into habitat/management sections, typically 5 m wide, and run from early April to late September for about 26 counts per year.
  - Transects are kept fixed to enable year-to-year comparisons; over half of UKBMS sites use this method annually.

- Weather and timing requirements:
  - Observations occur between 10:45 and 15:45, only under suitable butterfly activity conditions.
  - Weather criteria: dry conditions, wind less than Beaufort 5, and temperature of at least 13°C with at least 60% sunshine, or above 17°C if overcast.

- Single-species transects:
  - Follow the all-species transect methodology but are recorded only during selected weeks for the focal species.

- Timed counts and egg/larval web counts:
  - Timed counts record a species' abundance over a fixed period/area under similar weather constraints as transects.
  - Egg and larval web counts document eggs or larval webs in suitable habitats.

- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS):
  - Reduced-effort sampling established in 2009 to better cover farmland and other broader habitats.
  - Based on the BTO Breeding Bird Survey design: two parallel 1-km transects within randomly selected 1-km squares, subdivided into 10 sections.
  - 2–4 visits total, minimum 2 visits in July/August, with spring visits encouraged.
  - WCBS uses the fixed-route transect methodology but targets 1-km squares rather than traditional all-species transects.

- Data collection and entry:
  - Site location data are recorded in the field and later entered online via the UKBMS data portal (MyData) or via Transect Walker software.
  - Data can be entered directly by recorders or by regional transect coordinators.
  - If a transect route changes, it is treated as a new site with a new site number; new data are submitted through the same process.
  - Online data and Transect Walker files are uploaded into an Oracle database.

- Nature and units of recorded values:
  - Site data include OS grid references, transect length, number of sections, and WCBS status.
  - Grid references are broken down into Easting and Northing coordinates.
  - WCBS sites have limited data in some cases due to randomised 1-km square selection.

- Quality control:
  - Each site belongs to a regional transect coordinator who validates records.
  - After initial checks, data undergo automated and manual validation to verify site location data accuracy.

- Format and storage of site location data:
  - Stored as CSV with columns including: site number, site name, gridreference, Easting, Northing, Length, Country, No. of Sections, No. Years surveyed, First year surveyed, Last year surveyed, and Survey type (WCBS or UKBMS).
  - Note: First year surveyed and No. Years surveyed cover historical data; Last year surveyed reflects the most recent year up to 2012 for UKBMS data, and 2013 for first year/survey entry in some cases.
  - Some incomplete information may exist for WCBS sites due to their randomised 1-km square design.
