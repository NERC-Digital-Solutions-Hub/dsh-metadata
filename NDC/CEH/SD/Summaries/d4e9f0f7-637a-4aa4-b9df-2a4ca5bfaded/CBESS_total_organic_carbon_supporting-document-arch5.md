# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) total organic carbon in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats..

## Overview
- Metadata-rich dataset measuring total organic carbon via loss on ignition (LOI) in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats as part of CBESS.
- Sampled at 6 sites across 2 locations during winter and summer 2013, with 3 replicates across 22 quadrats at 4 spatial scales.
- Staff responsible: Christina Wood and Martin Solan.

## Scope and design
- Locations: Essex (Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes) and Morecambe Bay (Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands, West Plain).
- Habitat contrast: mudflat and saltmarsh; saltmarsh sites reflect two soil types (clay in Essex, sandy in Morecambe Bay) and differing inundation/creek structure/vegetation.
- Sampling regime: part of the general CBESS field campaign; no planned repeats.

## Data collection and methods
- Variable measured: organic carbon content via LOI.
- Field procedures: mudflat surface sediment scrapes; saltmarsh sediment collected from 2 cm below the surface.
- Sample handling: all samples frozen at -20°C and analyzed using standard LOI technique (detailed method available via linked LOI resources).
- Calibration and quality control: refer to LOI technique pages for calibration and data checking procedures.

## Data structure and formats
- Primary format: CSV file.
- Core identifiers: Row Number; Season (Winter W, Summer S); Location (Essex E, Morecambe M); Site (AH, FW, TM; CS, WS, WP); Habitat (Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM); Quadrat Number (1–22); Replicate (1–3); Measurement Type (LOI).
- Measurements include: crucible weights at multiple temperatures (e.g., 105, 400, 480, 950°C), dry weight values, loss on ignition (LOI), and calculated components (%Water, %carbohydrate, %total organic, %carbon, %CO2, wtCaCO3, %CaCO3, %Mineral Residue).
- Data field descriptors cover sediment weights (Cr, Cr+Sed), various dry/wet weight values, and derived composition percentages.

## Provenance and responsibilities
- Staff responsible: Christina Wood and Martin Solan.
- Procedures and calibration details linked to institution LOI facilities and methodologies (external reference URLs provided in metadata).

## Sharing, access, and governance
- Plan to upload datasets to relevant portals and catalogue holdings; dataset documentation highlights sharing considerations and metadata requirements.
- No explicit data embargo or access restrictions stated; users should verify any sharing limitations within the related metadata/lab pages.
- Data quality checks and calibration rely on LOI-based procedures; ensure alignment with other CBESS datasets for interoperability.

## Key considerations for data stewardship
- Ensure metadata remains complete and discoverable, with links to LOI methodology and QA steps.
- Maintain consistency of site/habitat nomenclature and coordinate details for interoperability with other CBESS records.
- Monitor for any future updates or repeats; current plan indicates no repeats, which should be reflected in data update workflows.
- Be prepared to harmonise this dataset with other carbon-related CBESS data to support broader ecosystem service analyses.
