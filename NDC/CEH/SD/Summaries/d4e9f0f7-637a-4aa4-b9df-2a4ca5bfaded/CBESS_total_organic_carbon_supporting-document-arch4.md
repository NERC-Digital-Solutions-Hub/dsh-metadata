# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) total organic carbon in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats.

## Dataset scope
- Measures total organic carbon in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats using loss on ignition (LOI).
- Samples from 6 sites across 2 locations (Essex and Morecambe Bay) and 2 habitat types (mudflat, saltmarsh).
- Seasonal sampling: winter and summer 2013.
- 3 replicates across 22 quadrats per site/habitat combination.
- CSV data format; detailed metadata and field descriptions provided.

## Study locations and habitat types
- Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Saltmarsh sites designed to represent contrasting soil types: clay soils in Essex and sandy soils in Morecambe Bay.
- Habitat contrasts: mudflat (cohesive clays, mud/silt in Essex; coarser sediments in Morecambe Bay) and saltmarsh with differing inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.

## Sampling design and timeline
- Part of the CBESS field campaign conducted in winter and summer 2013.
- No planned repeat sampling beyond the 2013 campaign.
- Mudflat samples: surface sediment scrapes; Saltmarsh samples: sediment cut from 2 cm below the surface.
- Samples frozen at -20°C and analyzed using standard LOI procedure (detailed protocol linked in metadata).

## Data fields, measurements, and schema
- Primary measurement: LOI (Loss on Ignition) to determine organic carbon content.
- Field/matrix data include: Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Quadrat Number (1–22), Scale (A–D representing 1 m to 100 m+), Replicate (1–3), and multiple weight-related variables (Cr, Cr + Sediment, various dry/wet weights).
- Derived/composition variables captured: %Water, %Carbohydrate, %Total Organic, %Carbon, %CO2, wtCaCO3, %CaCO3, %Mineral Residue.
- Row-level details and categorical encodings (Season: Winter W, Summer S; Location: Essex E, Morecambe M; Site names; Habitat: Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM; Scale categories; etc.).
- Comprehensive documentation of data columns, units, and formats to support discoverability and reuse.

## Data quality, standards, and formats
- Calibration and data-checking procedures referenced via LOI technique webpage.
- Data format released as CSV with accompanying metadata and field descriptions to support quality assessment and interoperability.

## Responsible personnel
- Staff responsible for the dataset: Christina Wood and Martin Solan.
