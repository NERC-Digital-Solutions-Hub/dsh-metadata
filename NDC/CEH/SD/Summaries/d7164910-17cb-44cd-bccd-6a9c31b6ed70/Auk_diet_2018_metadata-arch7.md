# The dataset:

## Overview
- Dataset of prey items for common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2018 breeding season off eastern Scotland.
- Part of long-term seabird diet studies standardized since 1987 (IMLOTS; JNCC Seabird Monitoring Programme).
- Aims to provide standard, repeatable methods and protocols for assessing diet.

## Study sites and scope
- Locations: East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA); Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA; Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR) — coordinates provided for each site.
- Timeframe: observations conducted in 2018 during chick-rearing periods; specific watch windows per site (04:00–22:00 at some sites; dawn–dusk at Isle of May; opportunistic observations elsewhere).
- Subjects: breeding adults of common guillemot and razorbill at three colonies.

## Methods and data collection
- Diet assessment approach: observe prey carried in bills by adults returning to feed chicks (or display in guillemot); razorbill data collected from multiple fish per bill.
- Observation details recorded: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; opportunistic observations recorded with limited fields (size and number for guillemot; size and number for razorbill as applicable).
- Field protocols: two-hour watches; plots containing active breeding sites; fieldwork conducted by trained staff to defined protocols; notebooks and field data sheets transcribed to spreadsheets; data backed up on CEH servers.
- Data integrity: notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh; databases quality controlled at source.

## Data fields and categorization
- Prey species: majority of diet comprises lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring); in-field separation of sprat/herring is often not possible; all such fish are classified as clupeids in the dataset.
- Size classification: prey assigned to five size classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) using adult bill length as a guide.
- Abundance recording: number of prey items recorded as exact counts or as broad categories (few, moderate, many); some observations limited to presence/absence of prey due to viewing constraints.
- Data limitations: some prey items presented to chicks cannot be identified to species or size due to wing spreading/arching during feeding; gadoids were often a small portion and sizes less reliably estimated.

## Species-specific notes
- Guillemot (Uria aalge):
  - Diet quantified using consistent methods since 1987.
  - Often a single prey item per foraging trip to feed the chick or used for display.
- Razorbill (Alca torda):
  - Diet quantified with multiple prey items per trip; data include prey number per observation.

## Data handling, quality, and output
- Data handling: recorded in field; transcribed to spreadsheets; backed up; archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Quality assurance: data quality controlled at source; outputs vetted by CEH management; alignment with contracted deliverables and reporting timelines.
- Publication: CEH staff encouraged to publish non-confidential results in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.

## Context and references
- Grounded in longstanding diet studies at Isle of May and other Scottish colonies; key references include works by Harris, Wanless, Daunt, Wilson, Thaxter, and colleagues across several decades (1985–2017).
- Provided as part of an ongoing monitoring framework (IMLOTS; JNCC Seabird Monitoring Programme).
