# The dataset:

- This dataset contains prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2018 breeding season at East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR), off the east coast of Scotland.
- Diet of these two species has been studied on the Isle of May since the 1980s; only a few prior diet studies exist at the other sites.

## Overview and purpose
- Standard, repeatable methods are used to assess diet for comparison across years and sites.
- Field measurements focus on prey carried in bills of breeding adults returning to the colony to feed chicks (and display for guillemot).

## Field measurements and data capture
- Observations are conducted by trained staff using fixed observation positions; data are recorded in notebooks/field data sheets and later transcribed to spreadsheets; backups are stored on CEH servers; notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Databases are quality controlled at the source; outputs undergo management vetting within CEH; researchers are encouraged to publish non-confidential findings with customer approval.

## Methods by species

- Common guillemot Uria aalge
  - Diet quantification methods standardized since 1987.
  - During chick-rearing, adults return with a single prey item (or display prey to others); data collected from visual observations.
  - Observation watches: East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast (two-hour watches 04:00–22:00 on specified dates); Isle of May (dawn to dusk on 1/7/18 and 3/7/18) plus opportunistic observations (28/4–21/7/18).
  - Recorded fields: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; opportunistic observations record only time and size.
  - Prey size categories: very small, small, medium, large, very large (based on adult bill length). Some prey may be obscured when fed to chicks; prey presented this way are assumed eaten; sizes for some items (especially fish) may be uncertain.
  - Most prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat/herring); sprat identified occasionally on Isle of May but all clupeids are treated as a single category in the dataset.
  - Fish on breeding ledges used to estimate lengths in size categories; too few gadids to assess sizes accurately; gadids constitute a very small portion of the diet.

- Razorbill Alca torda
  - Diet quantification methods standardized since 1987 (with specific references).
  - During chick-rearing, adults return with multiple fish in the bill for feeding chicks; data collected from visual observations.
  - Observation watches: East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast (two-hour watches 04:00–22:00 on specified dates); Isle of May (dawn to dusk on 1/7/18 and 3/7/18) plus opportunistic observations (13/6–9/7/18).
  - Recorded fields: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number; opportunistic observations record only time-related fields and size/number.
  - Prey size categories and identification conventions identical to guillemot (five size classes; clupeids grouped; sizes inferred from bill length).
  - Prey number is captured as exact estimates or broad categories ('few', 'moderate', 'many') due to difficulty counting prey in the bill.

## Data content and classification notes
- Across both species, the majority of prey items are lesser sandeel or clupeids; field differentiation between sprat and herring is usually not possible, so all clupeids are grouped together.
- Size classification relies on adult bill length; some observations cannot resolve species or exact size.
- Data on prey number (for razorbill) or exact counts (for guillemot) may be incomplete, with broader categories used when precise counting is challenging.

- 2018 observation windows vary by site, including fixed two-hour watches and additional opportunistic observations.

## Outputs, quality, and dissemination
- Diet data support long-term seabird diet assessment and cross-site comparisons.
- Outputs are aligned with contracted deliverables and subject to vetting by CEH management; findings are suitable for peer-reviewed publication with customer approval.
- Data management practices emphasize data integrity, traceability, and archival of field documentation.

## Background and references
- The Isle of May long-term seabird study (IMLOTS) and the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee’s national Seabird Monitoring Programme underpin the standardization of methods since 1987.
