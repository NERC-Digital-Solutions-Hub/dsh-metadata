# The dataset:

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2018 breeding season at East Caithness SPA, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May NNR off the east coast of Scotland.
  - Diet studies for these species at the Isle of May have a long history (since the 1980s); limited prior diet studies at Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA (2006, 2017) and East Caithness SPA (2017).
  - Part of ongoing seabird diet assessment work linked to long-term monitoring programmes.

- Context and governance
  - Field methods and diet calculation approaches have been standardized since 1987 as part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) and UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee seabird monitoring programme.
  - Data handling is integrated with CEH governance, with quality control at source and formal reporting pipelines.

- Data collection and measurements
  - Core method: observe prey carried in bills by breeding adults returning to feed chicks (and display behavior for common guillemot; razorbill feeds chicks with multiple fish).
  - Observation schedules:
    - East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast: two-hour watches (04:00–22:00) on defined date ranges.
    - Isle of May: dawn-to-dusk watches on specific dates; additional opportunistic observations.
  - Recorded variables per species:
    - Common guillemot: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; for opportunistic observations, only prey size and arrival time are relevant.
    - Razorbill: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number; opportunistic observations record prey size and number only.
  - Prey identification and categorization:
    - Most prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring); due to field identification limits, all clupeids are grouped together as clupeids.
    - Prey size classified into five categories: very small, small, medium, large, very large, guided by adult bill length.
    - Some prey obfuscated during feeding; items presented to chicks presumed eaten, though exact size/species may be uncertain.
    - Fish on breeding ledges used to estimate lengths within size categories; too few gadoids observed to determine precise sizes, but they form a small diet component.
  - Prey counts:
    - Number of prey recorded as exact counts or as broad categories (few, moderate, many) due to estimation challenges.

- Data management and quality assurance
  - Field data captured in notebooks and field sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets; backups stored on CEH servers; all notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases quality controlled at source; outputs reviewed by CEH management against deliverables; publication of non-confidential results encouraged with customer approval.
  - Data provenance and methods are documented to support reproducibility and repeatability of diet assessments.

- Data formats, reuse, and dissemination
  - Diet quantification methods and standard protocols are consistent with long-term seabird diet assessments.
  - Data are aligned with broader coding schemes (size classes, prey categories) to facilitate integration into portals and catalogues.
  - Associated literature and references provide methodological and contextual grounding.

- Location, timing, and references
  - Sites: East Caithness SPA (coordinates provided), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, Isle of May NNR (Isle of May coordinates provided).
  - Timeframe: observations conducted during the 2018 breeding season; detailed dates listed per site.
  - References include foundational and contemporaneous diet studies and methodological papers (Anderson et al. 2014; Daunt et al. 2008, 2017; Harris & Wanless 1985, 1986; Thaxter et al. 2013; Wilson et al. 2004).

- Notes for data stewards
  - Standardization since 1987 enables comparability across years and studies.
  - Clear conventions for handling uncertain identifications (grouping clupeids; acknowledging size/species uncertainty).
  - Transparent documentation of data collection contexts (watch vs. opportunistic observations) supports proper interpretation and metadata enrichment.
