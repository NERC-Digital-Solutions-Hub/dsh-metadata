# The dataset:

- Contains prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2018 breeding season at three sites off the east coast of Scotland: East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR).
- Builds on long-running diet studies (Isle of May since the 1980s) and standardises methods for comparability with prior work (e.g., 1987 standardisation).

## Scope and context

- The diet quantification methods have been consistent since seabird monitoring was standardised from 1987.
- Isle of May has a long-term monitoring context (IMLOTS, JNCC Seabird Monitoring Programme); other sites have limited prior diet data.
- Purpose: provide standard, repeatable diet assessment methods for common guillemot and razorbill.

## Field measurements and observation protocol

- Core approach: observe prey carried in bills of adults returning to feed chicks (guillemot) or displaying to others (guillemot display; razorbill provisioning with multiple fish).
- Observation windows and sites (two-hour watches where specified; dawn-to-dusk where noted):
  - East Caithness SPA: 04:00–22:00, 19/6–29/6/18.
  - Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA: 04:00–22:00, 25/6–7/7/18.
  - Isle of May: dawn-to-dusk on 1/7/18 and 3/7/18; opportunistic observations 28/4–21/7/18.
  - Razorbill-specific windows: East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, 04:00–22:00, 18/6–4/7/18 and 7/7–11/7/18; Isle of May opportunistic observations 13/6–9/7/18.
- Recorded data:
  - Guillemot: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; opportunistic observations include prey species and prey size (time of arrival not recorded).
  - Razorbill: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number; opportunistic observations include prey size and prey number (time of arrival not recorded).
- Prey identification and classification:
  - Most prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat/herring treated as clupeids because field separation is difficult).
  - Occasional small identifications of sprat when possible; all clupeids grouped together in the dataset.
- Size classification:
  - Five size classes: very small, small, medium, large, very large; size guided by adult bill length.
  - Some prey presented during feeding may not be fully identifiable; those items are presumed eaten.
  - For leading-ledge fishes, lengths of observed fish used to estimate size class.
  - Gadoids are a minor component; too few observed to provide reliable size estimates.

## Data handling and quality control

- Field notes and data sheets are transcribed to spreadsheets; all data are backed up on CEH servers; notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Databases quality controlled at source; outputs vetted by CEH management and aligned with contracted deliverables.
- Encouragement for non-confidential scientific publication with customer approval and acknowledgement.

## Output and reporting

- Diet data are prepared and presented with clear conclusions and charts.
- Data sources are tracked; datasets created may be made discoverable with metadata (where applicable).
