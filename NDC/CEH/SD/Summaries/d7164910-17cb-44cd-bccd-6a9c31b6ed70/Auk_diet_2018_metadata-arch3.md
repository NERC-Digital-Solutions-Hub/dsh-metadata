# The dataset:

## Purpose and scope
- Describes prey items of common guillemot (Uria aalge) and razorbill (Alca torda) observed during the 2018 breeding season.
- Sites: East Caithness SPA, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May NNR off the east coast of Scotland.
- Builds on long-term diet studies at Isle of May and recent diet work at the other sites; aims to provide standard, repeatable methods for assessing seabird diet.

## Background and standardisation
- Diet quantification methods have been consistent since seabird monitoring was standardised in 1987.
- Part of the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee seabird monitoring framework.
- The manual's purpose is to offer repeatable protocols for assessing diet of common guillemot and razorbill.

## Field measurements and data collection
- Diet assessed by observing prey carried in bills of breeding adults returning to feed chicks (or display in guillemot).
- Fieldwork conducted by trained staff using defined protocols; data recorded in notebooks and field sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets and backed up on CEH servers; physical notebooks archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Observation schedules:
  - Guillemot: two-hour watches (04:00–22:00) at specified plots during 2018 (dates given per site).
  - Razorbill: similar two-hour watches at sites with dawn-to-dusk observations on Isle of May and opportunistic observations elsewhere.
- Recorded data during watches: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; opportunistic observations also recorded prey number (for razorbill) or kept to the last two items (for guillemot).

## Data management and quality control
- Databases used were quality controlled at source.
- Output and integrity subject to internal management vetting and tracking within CEH (Heads of Science Areas, Directors, Finance Administration).
- Encouraged for CEH staff to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.

## Variables and measurement details
- Guillemot data:
  - Prey composition collected from observed prey items; display events may be mistaken for feeding but treated as potential prey.
  - Prey size categorized into five classes; fish sizes estimated from observations; occasional prey identification limited (small number of gadoids).
  - Most prey items are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat/herring) treated as clupeids due to field indistinguishability.
  - When feeding, prey items may be obscured; presumed eaten if presented to chick.
- Razorbill data:
  - Prey composition collected from multiple prey items in the bill; similar five-size-class framework; opportunistic observations record only prey size and number.
  - As with guillemot, clupeids treated as a single category due to identification limits.
- Size classification:
  - Prey classified into five size classes (very small to very large) using adult bill length as a guide.
  - Incomplete viewing during feeding may prevent species- or size-specific classification for some items.

## Outputs and reporting
- Data and results are vetted and linked to contracted deliverables; reports and visual outputs (charts/dashboards) are produced to communicate findings clearly.
- Results linked to customer requirements, with data governance and appropriate data sharing considerations.
- Findings and data are suitable for informing management decisions and policy considerations within seabird monitoring and fisheries contexts.

## References and context
- Key prior studies and methodological benchmarks cited (e.g., Harris & Wanless; Daunt et al.; Thaxter et al.; Wilson et al.).
- Diet assessment methods aligned with broader long-term seabird monitoring programmes (Isle of May IMLOTS; JNCC seabird monitoring).

## Notable considerations for monitoring policy and framework design
- Standardisation since 1987 supports comparability across years and sites.
- Data collection relies on skilled observers, predefined watch schedules, and consistent observational protocols.
- Challenges acknowledged include identification limits (especially distinguishing sprat vs. herring within clupeids) and incomplete viewing during feeding events.
- Data management practices emphasize upfront quality control, thorough archiving, and governance to enable data sharing and policy-relevant reporting.
