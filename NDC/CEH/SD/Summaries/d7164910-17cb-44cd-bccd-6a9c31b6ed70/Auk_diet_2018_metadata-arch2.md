# The dataset:

## Aim and context
- Standard, repeatable methods to assess the diet of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda.
- Long-standing monitoring framework linked to Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) and the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee Seabird Monitoring Programme.
- Diet calculation methods have been consistent since seabird monitoring was standardised from 1987.

## Study sites and monitoring period
- East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR) off the east coast of Scotland.
- Observation sites and coordinates provided; watches conducted at multiple colonies during 2018:
  - Common guillemot: 04:00–22:00 watches at East Caithness and Buchan Ness; dawn-to-dusk at Isle of May with opportunistic observations.
  - Razorbill: 04:00–22:00 watches at East Caithness and Buchan Ness; dawn-to-dusk at Isle of May with opportunistic observations.
- Dates vary by site, e.g., June–July 2018, with additional opportunistic dates.

## Field measurements and data collection
- Diet assessment based on prey carried in bills of breeding adults returning to feed chicks (and display for guillemot).
- Data recorded in field notebooks and data sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets; backups on CEH servers; notebooks archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Observers were trained staff following defined protocols; data quality control at source.

## Diet quantification and size classes
- Prey categorized into five size classes: very small, small, medium, large, very large, using adult bill length as a guide.
- For guillemot: often a single prey item per chick provisioning; some prey used for display; prey size and species recorded where visible; some items presumed eaten if shown during feeding.
- For razorbill: multiple fish per visit to the chick; prey size and number recorded; some observations limited to size and species when exact counts weren’t possible.
- Most prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring grouped as clupeids in the dataset); field separation of sprat and herring is generally not possible.

## Species-specific methods
- Common guillemot
  - Diet quantified from prey in bills during chick provisioning and display behavior.
  - Two-hour watches (04:00–22:00) at specified sites; Isle of May included dawn-to-dusk watches and opportunistic dates.
  - Prey time of arrival, species, and size recorded; exact prey counts sometimes not possible.
- Razorbill
  - Diet quantified from multiple prey items carried to chicks.
  - Similar watch periods and sites as guillemot; prey time of arrival, species, size, and number recorded; opportunistic observations capture limited data.

## Data management and quality
- Databases quality-controlled at the data source.
- Data handling and reporting are subject to management vetting to ensure alignment with contracted deliverables.
- CEH staff encouraged to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.

## Outputs, reporting and publication
- Outputs include datasets, reports, maps, and charts designed to support monitoring and policy assessment.
- Reports and outputs linked to contracted objectives and subject to formal vetting and timelines.
- Customer approval required for non-confidential scientific publications.

## Data access and challenges
- Challenges include increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data and enabling access to underlying data used to generate outputs.
- Data storage and access established through CEH systems; historical data linked to long-term seabird monitoring efforts.
- Some datasets (e.g., 2017 data at East Caithness, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast, and Isle of May) have been archived in recognized data centres (e.g., NERC Environmental Information Data Centre).
