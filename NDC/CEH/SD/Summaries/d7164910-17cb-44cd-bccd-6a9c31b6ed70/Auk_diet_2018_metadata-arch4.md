# The dataset:

## Overview
- Dataset of prey items for common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2018 breeding season.
- Locations: East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR) off the east coast of Scotland.
- Background context: diet studies at Isle of May since the 1980s; only a few prior diet studies at Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast and East Caithness SPA.
- Purpose: to provide standard, repeatable methods and protocols for assessing the diet of the two species as part of long-term seabird monitoring.

## Data scope and sampling design
- Field sites and timeframes:
  - East Caithness SPA and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA: two-hour watches from 04:00–22:00 on specific June–July 2018 windows.
  - Isle of May NNR: dawn-to-dusk watches on early July 2018, with additional opportunistic observations from late April to July 2018.
- Observation goals: quantify diet by recording prey items carried in bills returning to colonies to feed chicks (and display in guillemots).
- Observation structure: plots with active breeding sites; data collected during watches and opportunistic observations.

## Data collection and recorded variables
- For guillemot:
  - Time of arrival, prey species, prey size; opportunistic observations recorded only size and arrival time.
  - Prey size classified into five categories (very small to very large) using adult bill length as a guide.
  - Most prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring grouped as clupeids due to field indistinguishability).
  - Notes on prey presentation when fed to chicks; some items obscured, so size/species classification not always possible.
- For razorbill:
  - Time of arrival, prey species, prey size, and prey number; opportunistic observations recorded only size and number.
  - Similar dominance of lesser sandeel or clupeids; clupeids treated as a single group due to field identification limits.
  - Prey size classification method and potential obscuration as with guillemot.
- Prey categorization:
  - Five size classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large).
  - Fish on breeding ledges used to estimate lengths within size classes.
  - Gadoids were a very small diet component; too few data to assess sizes accurately.
- Prey quantity:
  - Number of prey recorded as either an exact estimate or a broad category (few, moderate, many) due to difficulty in precise counting.

## Data management and quality control
- Field data handling:
  - Field notebooks and data sheets used; transcribed to spreadsheets; regular backups to CEH servers.
  - Notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Data quality and governance:
  - Databases quality controlled at source.
  - Output and reporting subject to management vetting and tracking within CEH (Heads of Science Areas, Directors, Finance Administration).
  - Encouragement to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgement.
- Data accessibility and standards:
  - Methods standardized since 1987 as part of seabird monitoring standardization.
  - Data described and sourced in relation to long-term monitoring programmes (Isle of May IMLOTS; JNCC Seabird Monitoring Programme).

## Output and references
- The dataset document outlines the standard methods for calculating and reporting diet data.
- References supporting methodology and historical context include works by Harris & Wanless, Wilson et al., Daunt et al., Thaxter et al., and others spanning 1985–2017.

## Practical implications for data strategy (Data Leaders)
- Emphasizes the importance of standardized, repeatable protocols for long-term data comparability.
- Highlights data provenance from field to archive (notebook to spreadsheets to CEH servers) and rigorous quality control.
- Demonstrates alignment with larger monitoring programmes and the value of documenting methodological consistency.
- Illustrates governance around data outputs, reporting timelines, and publication approvals to balance stakeholder needs with scientific dissemination.
- Addresses challenges in data granularity and identifiability (e.g., clupeids vs sprat/herring) and how categorization is used to maintain data utility.
