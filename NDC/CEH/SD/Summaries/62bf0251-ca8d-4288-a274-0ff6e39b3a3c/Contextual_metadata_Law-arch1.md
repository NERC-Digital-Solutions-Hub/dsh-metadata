# Data on bait use of arboreal ants from an experiment in Malaysian Borneo, 2015-2018. (2019) Law, S.J. and Parr, C.L.

## Overview
- Dataset of ant abundance at baited traps set at 5 m vertical intervals across 12 trees in lowland tropical rainforest.
- Baits: carbohydrate (honey and oats) or protein (tuna); traps recorded with canopy vs trunk strata.
- Data collected February–May 2016, as part of a larger project in Maliau Basin Conservation Area, Sabah, Malaysia.
- Contributed by the UK NERC-funded Biodiversity And Land-use Impacts on Tropical Ecosystem Function (BALI) consortium.
- Purpose: describe patterns of bait use and species co-occurrence in arboreal ant assemblages.

## Experimental design
- Study area: old-growth dipterocarp rainforest in Maliau Basin; 12 plots within a 42-ha area (50 x 50 m plots; 15 m buffer; central 50 x 50 m sampled).
- Treatments (Oct 2014–Oct 2017): 4 control plots, 4 ant suppression plots, 4 termite suppression plots; plots separated by ≥100 m.
- Ant suppression: two bait types (Synergy Pro with hydramethylnon and pyriproxyfen; custom bait of Whiskas in sugar solution with imidacloprid 110 ppm).
- Termite suppression: removal of mounds; imidacloprid 23 ppm applied to soil; poisoned toilet paper rolls (TPR) and tea bags with fipronil 5.7 ppm deployed across plots.
- Sampling for bait-use analysis was restricted to four control plots.

## Methods (Data collection)
- Ants collected February–May 2016 on 12 trees using baited traps.
- Sampling: traps placed at 5 m height intervals from ground to canopy; total traps per tree 28–44 (average 35 ± 6), 416 traps total (208 carbohydrate, 208 protein).
- Each sampling station: two pairs of traps (four traps total) per height; each pair with one carbohydrate and one protein trap.
- Canopy defined as traps above the first branch; trunk as below.
- Traps hung on opposite sides of the trunk; left open for 24 hours.
- Collected specimens preserved in 70% ethanol; identified to genus and morphospecies; voucher specimens stored in Liverpool and Universiti Malaysia Sabah.
- Canopy access via single rope technique; safety lines used.

## Data provenance and interpretation
- Data collection by S.J. Law; interpretation by S.J. Law and C.L. Parr.
- Objective: characterize bait-use patterns and species co-occurrence in arboreal ant assemblages.
- Suitable for analyses of relationships between bait type, vertical stratum, height, and ant taxa; potential species co-occurrence analyses.

## Scope, limitations, and notes
- Limited to four control plots for this bait-use dataset; ant and termite suppression plots not included for this analysis.
- Time window restricted to February–May 2016.
- Data describe abundance by morphospecies within sampled traps; voucher specimens linked to collections for verification.
