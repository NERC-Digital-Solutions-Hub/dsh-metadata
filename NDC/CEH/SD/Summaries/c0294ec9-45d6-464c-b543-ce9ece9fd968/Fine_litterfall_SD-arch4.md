# AFEX Experiment at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA)

- Location and context
  - Study conducted at the AFEX (Amazon fertilization Experiment) area within BDFFP/INPA, ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil.
  - Site features: plateaued terrain (80–160 m a.s.l.), high rainfall seasonality, average temperature ~26.7 °C, annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm with a pronounced wet/dry season.

- Experimental design
  - Full factorial nutrient addition experiment starting May 2017.
  - Treatments: untreated control plus N, P, and cations (K, Mg, Ca) and all combinations:
    - N, P, Cations, N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations (eight treatments).
  - Experimental structure: four replicate plots per treatment, distributed over four independent blocks (minimum 250 m apart).
  - Plot layout: 32 plots total, each 50 m x 50 m; central measurement area of 30 m x 30 m to focus on canopy-litter within plots.
  - Nutrient application: manual dry granules three times per year.
    - Rates: N 125 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 (as urea), P 50 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 (as triple superphosphate), Ca 50 kg ha^-1 yr^-1, Mg 20 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 (as dolomitic limestone), K 50 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 (as potassium chloride).

- Litter production data collection
  - Litter traps: five traps per plot, each 50 cm x 50 cm, mounted ~1 m above ground (area 1.25 m^2 per plot).
  - Method: polyethylene 1 mm mesh screens to capture canopy-senesced leaves.
  - Sampling cadence: installed July 2017; litter collected biweekly for two years.
  - Processing: dried at 65 °C; weights measured with precision to 0.01 g to obtain dry biomass (g kg^-1).
  - Fractionation: sorted into leaves; fine woody material (<2 cm diameter); reproductive material (flowers, fruits, seeds); insect frass; residues (other).
  - Species-level leaf identification: not performed; leaf data reported as plot-level means.

- Data and metadata considerations
  - Data types include: plot/treatment structure, replication, geographic coordinates (site-level), sampling schedule, dry biomass measurements, and litter fractions.
  - Units and methods defined (e.g., drying temperature, balance precision, trap area, plot dimensions).
  - References accompany the methodology, indicating established protocols and prior measurements.

- Relevance for data management and use
  - Demonstrates a complex, multi-factor experimental design with explicit plot-level replication and long-term litter data collection.
  - Highlights data governance needs common to environmental data:
    - Documentation of plots, treatments, and blocks for traceability.
    - Standardized metadata (sites, plots, sampling intervals, measurement methods, units).
    - Clear data sharing and discoverability practices, given the multi-year, multi-component dataset.
  - Potential data gaps:
    - Absence of species-level leaf data; analysis relies on plot-level means.
    - Limited metadata details on data formats, versioning, and data quality checks beyond described methods.
