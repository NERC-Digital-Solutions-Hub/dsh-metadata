# Site description

- Location and environment
  - AFEX project area (Amazon fertilization Experiment) within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil.
  - Terrain: plateaus 80–160 m above sea level with steep slopes and valleys.
  - Climate: average ~26.7°C with small seasonal temperature variation; mean annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm (peak >300 mm/month in April; dry period June–October with <100 mm/month); relative humidity 75–92%.

- Experimental design (AFEX Experiment)
  - Full factorial nutrient addition with eight treatments: control, N, P, cations (K, Mg, Ca), and their combinations (N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations).
  - Layout: four independent blocks (≥250 m apart), 32 plots total.
  - Plot size and sampling area: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m.
  - Nutrient application rates (dry granules, applied three times/year):
    - N: 125 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as urea)
    - P: 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as triple superphosphate)
    - Ca: 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹
    - Mg: 20 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as dolomitic limestone)
    - K: 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as potassium chloride)

- Litter production and nutrient analysis (data collection)
  - Litter traps: five per plot, each 50 cm × 50 cm, placed 1 m above ground; total sampling area per plot 1.25 m².
  - Sample capture: polyethylene screens (1 mm mesh) to collect senesced canopy litter.
  - Installation and sampling timeline: first week of July 2017; litter collected biweekly for two years.
  - Sample processing: dried at 65°C and weighed with precision of 0.01 g to obtain dry biomass (g per kg).
  - Fraction sorting (after each collection): leaves; woody material (<2 cm diameter); reproductive material (flowers, fruits, seeds); insect frass and other residues.
  - Species identification: leaves not identified by species; land-area means calculated at the plot level.

- Data relevance for GIS
  - Spatial arrangement includes four long-term blocks, 32 plots with clear coordinates and plot extents.
  - Central 30 m × 30 m sampling area per plot aligns with precise spatial analysis and map-based visualization of litter production and nutrient effects.
  - Potential data layers: plot boundaries, block assignments, nutrient treatment, litter biomass by fraction, sampling dates, and environmental context (climate variables).
