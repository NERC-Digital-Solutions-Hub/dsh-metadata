# AFEX Experiment

- A full factorial nutrient addition study (AFEX) in the Amazonian forest fragments within the BDFFP/INPA, started in May 2017.
- Objective: investigate how nutrient additions affect litter production and nutrient cycling in tropical forest fragments.

## Site and Climate Context

- Location: AFEX area, Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.
- Terrain: plateaus (80–160 m above sea level) with steep slopes and valleys.
- Climate: small seasonal temperature variation; average around 26.7 °C; mean annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm (wet peak in April; dry period June–October); relative humidity 75–92%.

## Experimental Design and Treatments

- Treatments: eight total—untreated control, Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), cations (K, Mg, Ca) and their combinations (N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations).
- Experimental structure: 4 replicate plots per treatment across four independent blocks (minimum 250 m between blocks), totaling 32 plots.
- Plot dimensions: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m to maximize litter sampling from within the plot.
- Nutrient application: manual dry granules applied to soil surface three times per year.
  - Rates: N 125 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as urea); P 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as triple superphosphate); Ca 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1; Mg 20 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as dolomitic limestone); K 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as potassium chloride).

## Litterfall Measurement and Analysis

- Litter traps: five traps per plot (50 cm × 50 cm), elevated 1 m, area per plot 1.25 m^2; traps lined with 1 mm mesh screens to capture senesced leaves.
- Deployment and sampling: installed in early July 2017; litter collected biweekly for two years.
- Processing: dried at 65 °C and weighed with a precision balance (0.01 g).
- Fractionation: collected litter sorted into leaves; woody material (<2 cm diameter); reproductive material (flowers, fruits, seeds); insect frass and other residues.
- Data characteristics: leaves not identified to species; leaf data reflect plot-level averages.

## Data Outputs, Standardisation, and Access (Context for Environmental Monitoring)

- Methodology emphasizes standardised collection and processing to produce comparable outputs (e.g., litter production by fraction) suitable for monitoring environmental responses over time.
- Outputs intended to be presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and are compatible with integration into broader environmental data portals and datasets.
- The study design aligns with the archetype’s aims of ensuring data quality, reproducibility, and potential accessibility for broader reuse, enabling combination with other environmental datasets to enhance value and transparency of monitoring outcomes.
