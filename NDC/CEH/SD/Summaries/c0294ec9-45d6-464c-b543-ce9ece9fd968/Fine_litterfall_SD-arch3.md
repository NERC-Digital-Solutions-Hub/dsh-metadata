# AFEX Experiment (Amazon fertilization Experiment) at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA)

- Purpose and scope
  - Full factorial nutrient addition experiment to study how added nutrients affect litter production and nutrient cycling in Amazonian forest fragments.
  - Initiated in May 2017; includes untreated control and combinations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and cations (K, Mg, Ca).

- Location and environmental context
  - Site: AFEX area within BDFFP/INPA, ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil.
  - Terrain: plateaus 80–160 m above sea level with steep slopes and valleys.
  - Climate: ~26.7°C average temperature; mean annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm with a wet season peak (April) and a dry period (June–October); relative humidity 75–92%.

- Experimental design and layout
  - Treatments: 8 total (control, N, P, cations, and all combinations: N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations).
  - Replication and blocks: 4 replicates per treatment across 4 independent blocks, with at least 250 m between blocks.
  - Plot structure: each plot 50 m x 50 m; central sampling area 30 m x 30 m to maximize litter originating from within the plot.
  - Nutrient application schedule: dry granules applied manually three times per year; target annual rates – N: 125 kg ha^-1 (as urea), P: 50 kg ha^-1 (as triple superphosphate), Ca: 50 kg ha^-1, Mg: 20 kg ha^-1 (as dolomitic limestone), K: 50 kg ha^-1 (as KCl).

- Litter production measurement and sampling
  - Litter traps: five traps per plot (50 cm x 50 cm; 1 m above ground) covering 1.25 m^2 per plot.
  - Sampling timeline: installed July 2017; litter collected biweekly for two years.
  - Processing: dried at 65°C; weighed with 0.01 g precision to determine dry biomass (g kg^-1).
  - Fractionation: after each collection, litter separated into leaves, woody material (<2 cm diameter), reproductive material (flowers/fruits/seeds), insect frass, and other residues.
  - Species identification: leaves not identified to species; leaf characteristics averaged at the plot level.

- Data quality and documentation notes (implied)
  - Standardized, repeatable protocol for collection, drying temperature, and weighing accuracy.
  - Central area sampling and plot-level averaging help ensure samples reflect plot-level responses.
  - Clear documentation of treatment structure and sampling cadence to support long-term monitoring and cross-study comparability.
