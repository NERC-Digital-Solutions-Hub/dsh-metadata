# AFEX Experiment (Amazon fertilization Experiment) at the BDFFP/INPA

## Site context
- Location: AFEX project area, Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (02°25' S, 59°43' W).
- Landscape: plateaus (80–160 m above sea level), steep slopes and valleys.
- Climate: average temperature ~26.7°C; mean annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm with a peak in April (>300 mm/month) and a dry period June–October (<100 mm/month); relative humidity 75–92%.

## Experimental design (AFEX Experiment)
- Type: full factorial nutrient addition experiment started May 2017.
- Treatments: untreated control; nitrogen (N); phosphorus (P); cations (K, Mg, Ca) and their combinations (N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations).
- Structure: 8 treatments, 4 replicates per treatment, organized into 4 independent blocks with ≥250 m distance between blocks.
- Plots: 32 plots total, each 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area within each plot is 30 m × 30 m to maximize litter sampled from the plots.
- Nutrient application: manual dry granules applied three times per year.
  - Rates: N 125 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ as urea; P 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ as triple superphosphate; Ca 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹; Mg 20 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ as dolomitic limestone; K 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ as potassium chloride.

## Litterfall production and nutrient analysis
- Litter sampling: five traps per plot (50 cm × 50 cm), positioned 1 m above ground; trap area per plot = 1.25 m².
- Collection schedule: biweekly collections for two years; traps installed in early July 2017.
- Processing: dried at 65°C and weighed to determine dry biomass (g kg⁻¹).
- Fractions sorted per collection: leaves; twigs/woody material <2 cm diameter; reproductive material (flowers, fruits, seeds); insect frass; other residues.
- Leaf data: not identified by species; leaf characteristics averaged at the plot level.
