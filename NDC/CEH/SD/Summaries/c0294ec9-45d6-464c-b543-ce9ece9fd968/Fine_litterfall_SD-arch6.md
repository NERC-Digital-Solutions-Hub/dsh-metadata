# AFEX Experiment (Amazon fertilization Experiment)

- A nutrient addition study conducted in the AFEX project area at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), near Manaus, Brazil.

## Site description

- Location: AFEX project area, BDFFP/INPA, ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Coordinates: 02° 25' 00'' S, 59° 43' 00'' W.
- Environment: Plateau landscapes (80–160 m above sea level) with steep slopes and valleys.
- Climate: Mild seasonal variation; mean annual temperature ~26.7°C; rainfall 1900–3500 mm/year with a peak in April (>300 mm/month) and a dry period Jun–Oct (<100 mm/month). Relative humidity ranges 75–92%.

## Experimental design and treatments

- Study type: Full factorial nutrient addition experiment started in May 2017.
- Treatments: Eight treatments including an untreated control and combinations of nutrients:
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Phosphorus (P)
  - Cations (Potassium K, Magnesium Mg, Calcium Ca)
  - Combinations: N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations
- Replication and layout: Four replicate plots per treatment, distributed across four independent blocks (minimum 250 m apart).
- Plots: 32 plots total, each 50 m × 50 m; main measurements taken in a central 30 m × 30 m area to maximize litter sampled from plot trees.
- Nutrient application: Manual ground granule applications three times per year.
  - Rates: 125 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ N (as urea); 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ P (as triple superphosphate); 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ Ca; 20 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ Mg (as dolomitic limestone); 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ K (as potassium chloride).

## Litterfall production and nutrient analysis

- Litter traps: Five traps per plot, each 50 cm × 50 cm, placed 1 m above ground (total area per plot 1.25 m²). Litter assurance is via 1 mm mesh polyethylene screens.
- Sampling schedule: Traps installed in early July 2017; litter collected biweekly for two years.
- Sample processing: Dried at 65°C and weighed with a precision balance (0.01 g) to determine dry biomass (g·kg⁻¹, per the report).
- Fractions and sorting: After collection, litter sorted into leaves; woody material (twigs/branches <2 cm diameter); reproductive material (flowers/fruits/seeds); insect frass and other residues.
- Notes on identification: Leaves not identified by species; leaf characteristics reported as plot-level means.

## Data implications and potential outputs

- Data types: Spatially explicit plot-level data on litter production, biomass, and nutrient-related fractions over time, across eight nutrient treatments and four blocks.
- Temporal resolution: Biweekly litterfall data over two years, enabling analysis of treatment effects and temporal dynamics.
- Data quality considerations: Central-area sampling enhances comparability across plots; standardized drying and weighing procedures ensure consistent biomass estimates; species-level leaf data are not resolved, representing a trade-off in taxonomic detail.
- Potential data products for end users: 
  - Treatment-by-time summaries of litter production and biomass composition.
  - Comparisons of nutrient addition effects on litter fractions (leaves, woody material, reproductive material).
  - Temporal trend dashboards showing how litterfall responds to N, P, and cation additions.
  - Nutrient stock estimations from litterfall data to inform ecosystem nutrient cycling studies.
