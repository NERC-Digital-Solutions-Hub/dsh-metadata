# Water discharge data for Trout Beck, Cumbria.  1961 - 1980

## Overview
- Dataset of water discharge data from Trout Beck, Cumbria, UK.
- Collected by various staff at Moor House Research Station for the Wear and Tees River Board and the NRA; personnel not recorded.
- Stored in a database described by Cuthbertson (1993) in J. Env. Management (link/DOI provided).

## Site location
- Trout Beck Weir located at grid reference 375900 533600.

## Variables
- DATID: Recording location
- REC_TIME: Date (DAY)
- TCMD: Total Mean Daily Discharge (cumecs)
- MEAN: Mean daily discharge (cumecs)
- HIGHEST: Highest daily discharge (cumecs)
- LOWEST: Lowest daily discharge (cumecs)
- HGH_TIME: Hour of greatest discharge
- LOW_TIME: Hour of lowest discharge

## Recording locations and temporal resolutions
- DATID 39: Trout Beck gauging station
  - Data originally in Imperial units (converted)
  - Earliest date: 01-Oct-1961; Last date: 30-Sep-1968
- DATID 17: TROUTBECK gauging station (Northumberland Water Authority)
  - Earliest date: 01-Oct-1968; Last date: 30-Jun-1980

## Data coverage and time range
- Coverage spans 1961–1980, with data split across two recording locations/periods.
- Imperial units converted to metric (cumecs).

## Data notes and anomalies
- A large peak in discharge occurs in March 1979; no notes in the database, but likely related to snowmelt after a major UK snow event.

## Metadata, provenance, and data quality
- Data provenance documented in a 1993 publication; staff names not recorded.
- Units conversion acknowledged; dataset includes detailed variable descriptions and recording locations to aid discovery and reuse.
- Datasets described for environmental research programs; suitable for analyses requiring daily discharge measures and temporal patterns.

## Implications for data leadership and governance
- Highlights importance of cross-location data harmonization (different DATIDs, periods, and units).
- Illustrates need for clear metadata to support discoverability, provenance, and data quality assessment.
- Demonstrates value of documenting data origins, variable definitions, and known anomalies to enable user-driven iteration and potential data improvements or supplementation.
- Underlines ongoing relevance of archiving legacy data with explicit references to published metadata sources and DOIs for traceability.
