# Water discharge data for Trout Beck, Cumbria.  1961 - 1980

## Overview
- Water discharge dataset for Trout Beck, Cumbria, UK.
- Collected by various staff at Moor House Research Station for the Wear and Tees River Board and the NRA; staff names not recorded.
- Data stored in a database described by Cuthbertson (1993); DOI: https://doi.org/10.1006/jema.1993.1023
- Site location: Trout Beck Weir, grid reference 375900 533600.

## Dataset scope and provenance
- Temporal coverage: 1961–1980 (Earliest date 01-OCT-1961; Last date 30-SEP-1980).
- Recording locations (DATID): 
  - 39: Trout Beck gauging station (data originally in Imperial units; converted to metric).
    - Earliest date: 01-OCT-1961; Last date: 30-SEP-1968.
  - 17: TROUTBECK gauging station (data from Northumberland Water Authority).
    - Earliest date: 01-OCT-1968; Last date: 30-JUN-1980.
- Data collection context: data collected on behalf of the Wear and Tees River Board and the NRA.

## Data structure and variables
- Key fields:
  - DATID: Recording location.
  - REC_TIME: Date (day represented by the record).
  - TCMD: Total Mean Daily Discharge (cumecs).
  - MEAN: Mean discharge (cumecs).
  - HIGHEST: Highest discharge (cumecs).
  - LOWEST: Lowest discharge (cumecs).
  - HGH_TIME: Time (hour) of greatest discharge.
  - LOW_TIME: Time (hour) of lowest discharge.

## Recording locations and temporal resolutions
- 39 – Trout Beck gauging station: 01-OCT-1961 to 30-SEP-1968; Imperial measurements converted to metric.
- 17 – TROUTBECK gauging station (Northumberland Water Authority): 01-OCT-1968 to 30-JUN-1980.

## Notes and data quality considerations
- Notable data point: a large discharge peak in March 1979; no accompanying notes in the database, possible relation to snowmelt after a major UK snow event.
- Names of data staff not recorded; limited metadata beyond variable definitions and dates.
- Metadata indicates standard variable definitions and units; explicit quality assurance details are not provided.

## Data management and accessibility for data stewards
- Provenance: stored in a database described by Cuthbertson (1993); DOI available.
- Access considerations: dataset appears to be historical and may require querying through the described database or referenced publication.
- Governance implications for data stewards:
  - Ensure metadata completeness (staff attributions missing; confirm provenance and any data processing steps).
  - Maintain unit consistency (Imperial to metric conversions already performed).
  - Track temporal coverage and recording location changes (two DATIDs with distinct time spans).
  - Document notable anomalies (March 1979 peak) and seek any supplementary notes or metadata.
  - Facilitate discoverability and potential updates through appropriate portals and catalogues.
