# Water discharge data for Trout Beck, Cumbria.  1961 - 1980

## Summary
- A dataset of water discharge records for Trout Beck, Cumbria, UK, spanning 1961–1980.
- Data collected by various staff at Moor House Research Station for the Wear and Tees River Board and the NRA; staff names are not recorded.
- Stored in a database described by Cuthbertson (1993) and accessible via a DOI link.

## Dataset scope and provenance
- Purpose: environmental discharge data compilation for analysis and monitoring.
- Provenance: collected on behalf of regional river authorities; reliability tied to the contributing staff and the data management described in the referenced database publication.
- Reference: Cuthbertson, M. (1993). A database for environmental research programmes. Journal of Environmental Management, 37(4), 291-300. DOI: 10.1006/jema.1993.1023.

## Site and location
- Trout Beck Weir grid reference: 375900 533600.
- Recording locations (DATID) indicate different gauging stations and historical contexts:
  - 39: Trout Beck gauging station; data originally in Imperial units, converted to metric.
  - 17: TROUTBECK gauging station; data from Northumberland Water Authority.

## Variables and definitions
- REC_TIME: recording date (date).
- TCMD: Total Mean Daily Discharge (cumecs).
- MEAN: Mean discharge (cumecs).
- HIGHEST: Highest discharge of the day (cumecs).
- LOWEST: Lowest discharge of the day (cumecs).
- HGH_TIME: Hour of the greatest discharge.
- LOW_TIME: Hour of the lowest discharge.

## Temporal coverage and data structure
- 39 (Trout Beck gauging station): 01-Oct-1961 to 30-Sep-1968.
- 17 (TROUTBECK gauging station): 01-Oct-1968 to 30-Jun-1980.
- Data originally in Imperial units for station 39, converted to metric units for consistency.

## Data notes and considerations
- A large peak in discharge is observed in March 1979; no notes within the database explain this peak, but it may be related to snowmelt following a major UK snow event.
- Names of staff who contributed data are not available, which may affect provenance tracing.
- Potential considerations for analysts: temporal and unit conversions, potential gaps between 1961–1980, and the need to reference the original database description for schema details.
