# Water discharge data for Trout Beck, Cumbria.  1961 - 1980

- Overview
  - Historical dataset of water discharge from Trout Beck, Cumbria, UK.
  - Data collected by various staff at Moor House Research Station on behalf of the Wear and Tees River Board and the NRA; recorder names not preserved.
  - Stored in a database described by Cuthbertson (1993): A database for environmental research programmes (J. Env. Management).
  - Data description and reference: https://doi.org/10.1006/jema.1993.1023.

- Site location
  - Trout Beck Weir located at grid reference 375900 533600.

  - TCMD: Total Mean Daily Discharge (cumecs)
  - MEAN: Mean discharge (cumecs)
  - HIGHEST: Highest discharge during the day (cumecs)
  - LOWEST: Lowest discharge during the day (cumecs)
  - HGH_TIME: Time of greatest discharge (hour)
  - LOW_TIME: Time of lowest discharge (hour)

- Data quality and stewardship considerations
  - Data provenance includes multiple staff participation; individual names not recorded.
  - Dataset stored in a formal database; the structure and variables are documented (Cuthbertson, 1993).
  - Units converted from Imperial to metric; standardized data description aids integration with other datasets.
  - As with environmental monitoring data, opportunities exist to increase value by linking with additional datasets and improving underlying data accessibility for downstream users.
