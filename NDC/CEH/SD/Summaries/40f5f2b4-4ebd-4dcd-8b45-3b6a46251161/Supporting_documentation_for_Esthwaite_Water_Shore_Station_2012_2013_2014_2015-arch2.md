# Supporting Document Data from a meteorological station next to Esthwaite Water 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Jones, I.D., Feuchtmayr, H., Maberly, S.C. (2017)

## Purpose and scope
- Meteorological data collected from a station atop a boat house in Cumbria, England, next to Esthwaite Water.
- Observations cover air temperature (°C) and wind speed (m/s) for years 2012–2015.
- Data are intended for environmental monitoring and supporting multiple scientific studies.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Instruments provide data at 4-minute intervals.
- Hourly averages are calculated by a Campbell Scientific datalogger, using data from the previous hour; for example, the 2 p.m. value is the average from 1:00–2:00, including 2:00 but excluding 1:00.
- All times are in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).

## Quality control
- Data are raw and have not been calibrated or quality controlled.
- Visual checks have been performed; obvious hardware-related errors have been removed.
- Gaps occur due to maintenance work or sensor/logger problems.

## Data structure and format
- Data are provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file with:
  - Date_GMT: Date and time in GMT of measurement.
  - Air_Temperature: Air temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - Wind_Speed: Wind speed in metres per second.

## Data interpretation and usage notes
- The station’s data are used in several current scientific studies, including those by PhD students.
- Units and time conventions are clearly specified (GMT timing; hourly averages as defined above).
- The dataset is suitable for environmental health monitoring, trend analysis, and integration with other environmental data sources.
