# Data from a meteorological station next to Esthwaite Water 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015

## Overview
- Location: Meteorological station on top of a boat house in Cumbria, England, next to Esthwaite Water.
- Variables: Air temperature (°C) and wind speed (m/s).
- Sampling: Data collected every 4 minutes; hourly averages provided.
- Time frame: 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.
- Time reference: All data in GMT.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Instruments record data at 4-minute intervals.
- Hourly averages are calculated by a Campbell Scientific datalogger.
- Example: The value for 2 p.m. is the average of data between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., excluding data measured at 1 p.m. and including data measured at 2 p.m.

## Quality control
- The dataset is raw and has not been calibrated or quality controlled yet.
- Data have been visually checked; obvious errors from hardware malfunctions removed.
- Gaps in data are due to maintenance work or sensor/logger problems.

## Data structure and format
- File format: Comma separated values (CSV).
- Columns:
  - Date_GMT: Date and time (GMT) of measurement.
  - Air_Temperature: Air temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - Wind_Speed: Wind speed in metres per second.

## Usage and notes
- Data from this station are used in several current scientific studies, including those by PhD students.
- Data are raw and may require calibration and further quality control before formal analysis.
- Researchers should be aware of potential data gaps and the need for data validation when integrating with other datasets.
