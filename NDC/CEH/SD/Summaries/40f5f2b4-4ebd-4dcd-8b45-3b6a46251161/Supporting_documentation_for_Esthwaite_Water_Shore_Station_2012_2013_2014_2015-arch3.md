# Supporting Document Data from a meteorological station next to Esthwaite Water 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Jones, I.D., Feuchtmayr, H., Maberly, S.C. (2017)

## Overview
- Meteorological data collected from a station on top of a boat house near Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.
- Measured variables: air temperature (°C) and wind speed (m/s).
- Data cadence: every 4 minutes; hourly averages calculated by a Campbell Scientific datalogger.
- Time reference: GMT; data cover 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.
- The dataset is used in several current scientific studies, including PhD research.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Instruments at the station collect air temperature and wind speed.
- Hourly averages are computed over the previous hour (e.g., the 2 p.m. value is the average from 1–2 p.m., excluding 1 p.m. data and including 2 p.m. data).
- Data are presented as GMT timestamps for each measurement period.

## Quality control
- Data are raw and have not yet been calibrated or quality controlled.
- Visual checks performed; obvious hardware-related errors removed.
- Data gaps arise from maintenance work or sensor/logger problems.

## Data structure
- File format: comma-separated values (CSV).
- Columns:
  - Date_GMT: date and time (GMT) of measurement.
  - Air_Temperature: air temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - Wind_Speed: wind speed in metres per second.
- Descriptions accompany each column to clarify the data meaning.
- Units explicitly stated: °C for air temperature; m/s for wind speed.
- Note: data from this station are currently used in several scientific studies, including work by PhD students.
