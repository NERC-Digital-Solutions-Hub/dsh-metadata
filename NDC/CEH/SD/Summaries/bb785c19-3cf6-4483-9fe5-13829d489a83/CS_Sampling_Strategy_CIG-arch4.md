# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the sampling strategy and evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify field surveys for Countryside Survey (CS) from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasises the value of a time-series approach and the necessity of a consistent, stratified sampling framework to detect change across Britain.
- Highlights the link between land classification, sample allocation, and national/regional estimates of habitat areas.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification (1978–2007)
- Early concept: stratified ecological sampling to ensure representative coverage of the landscape and minimise bias.
- 1978: First full Land Classification using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on 1 km squares; 32 classes created from environmental attributes; surrounding four squares assigned to these classes; 256 squares surveyed nationwide.
- 1984: Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); focus shifted toward land use and habitat mapping while retaining the 1978 framework.
- 1990: Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) extended the classification to all GB squares; coastal urban corrections applied; 508 squares surveyed; first Land Cover Map linked to the programme.
- 1990s: Realisation that a GB-wide, all-squares classification required updating surrogates (climate, geology, physiography) for feasibility; new classifications maintained class characteristics, though some squares shifted class.
- 2000: CS2000 introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland); land classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata formed; additional Welsh sampling to improve representation; upland habitat sampling module introduced.
- 2007: CS2007 added Wales-only reporting needs; Welsh sub-divisions created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 43 extra Welsh squares allocated; England classes adjusted accordingly; overall 45 strata maintained with increased country-specific representation.
- Across generations, maps and descriptions of land classes (and their crosswalks) were refined to improve regional and country-specific estimates.

## Sampling Framework and Data Estimation
- Core principle: derive national estimates by applying the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class to the total area of that class.
- Sample sizes by survey:
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class) across 32 classes.
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (all GB squares classified; 3rd field survey).
  - CS2000: 569–569 total squares across 40–40+ strata with country-unit adjustments; added upland sampling module.
  - CS2007: 591 total squares with Wales-specific refinements; 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure Welsh class representation.
- Country-specific estimates:
  - Post-1990 adjustments to report England & Wales and Scotland separately, using country-unit versions of land classes and reallocation of squares to ensure representative sampling within each country.
  - Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced.
- Uplands module (CS2000/CS2007):
  - Additional 30 squares targeted in uplands and marginal uplands to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Data and outputs:
  - National and country-level estimates published in sequence (e.g., CS1990 main report; CS2000 summaries; CS2007 UK Results).
  - Maps and classifications used to illustrate sampling frame and country-specific stratifications.

## Country-specific Reporting and Uplands
- Wales-specific reporting drives additional Welsh sampling and class subdivisions to enable Wales-only estimates with acceptable precision.
- England and Wales sampling sub-divided into country-unit variants; some English classes retain lower sample counts due to representation considerations.
- Wales saw substantial expansion in Welsh-class representations (e.g., five new Welsh sub-classes) to support robust Wales-only statistics.
- United Kingdom-wide consistency requires careful cross-walks between classifications used in different surveys, with preference given to the latest classification for within-survey estimates and older classifications for cross-survey consistency.

## Data Governance and Implementation Implications for Data Leaders
- Time-series value: the methodology is deeply tied to historical classifications; maintaining lineage and documentation for each classification version is essential for trend analysis.
- Metadata and provenance: detailed records of how squares were allocated, reclassified, and crosswalks between classifications are critical for data discoverability and reuse.
- Representativeness and bias: stratified sampling mitigates bias but changes in classifications and country-specific subdivisions can affect cross-survey comparability; explicit notes on comparability and crosswalk strategies are important.
- Data architecture considerations: evolving Land Classification maps (and their country-unit variants) require robust data models to support multiple classifications and aggregations across time and geography.
- Stakeholder alignment: Welsh and upland modules reflect targeted user needs (policy and environmental reporting); data practices should accommodate country-specific requirements while preserving UK-wide comparability.
- Documentation and dissemination: iterative reports (1990, 2000, 2007) and accompanying figures/maps are key artifacts; ongoing governance should ensure accessibility and traceability of these outputs for current and future analyses.
