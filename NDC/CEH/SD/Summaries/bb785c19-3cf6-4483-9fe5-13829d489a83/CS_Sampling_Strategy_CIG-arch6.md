# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview and aim
  - Long-running field survey of Great Britain; uses the ITE Land Classification to stratify sampling and produce national and country-specific estimates of habitat and land-use features.
  - Outputs include maps, tables, and data products that support policy, monitoring, and public understanding of countryside change.

- Core concepts and methodology
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage and reduce bias.
  - Sampling units are 1 km2 squares; early design used the centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares also classified.
  - National estimates derive from mean habitat area per square within each land class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - Data products include land-class maps, class-based summaries, and country-specific estimates.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework
  - 1978 (CS1978): First Land Classification with 32 classes; 8 squares per class were surveyed (256 total); central-square approach plus surrounding classification; established a stratified, random framework for GB.
  - 1984 (CS1984): Second field survey; increased sample size to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the Land Classification framework.
  - 1990 (CS1990): All GB 1 km squares considered in Land Classification; urban and sea corrections applied; 508 squares surveyed; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1998/2000 (CS2000): Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; framework adapted to support separate country estimates (England with Wales and Scotland); sub-division and aggregation of classes created 40 strata, later expanded to 45 with country-unit subdivisions; added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland/marginal upland habitat module added (30 additional upland squares) to improve upland estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-focused reporting strengthened; introduced Welsh-country-unit sub-classes (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure Welsh class representation; some English classes in CS2007 had as few as 4 squares per class, deemed acceptable per scoping guidance.

- Country-specific reporting and upland module
  - To support policy needs and devolution, CS2000/CS2007 implemented country units (England with Wales, Scotland) for estimates.
  - Wales received enhanced sampling and separate Welsh subdivisions; Isle of Man samples removed from country estimates and replaced.
  - An uplands module added to CS2000 (and associated surveys) targeted habitats in upland regions to improve accuracy of country-level habitat estimates.

- Data outputs and interpretation
  - Survey results are presented as:
    - Number of sample squares per land-class stratum (and per country).
    - Maps showing current ITE Land Class maps and sample locations (Figures 4–7).
    - Tables detailing square counts, distribution across classes, and sampling rates (e.g., CS2007 Table 3; CS2000/Tables).
  - National estimates are calculated by combining per-square habitat areas with class areas; considerations noted about consistency when changing land-class schemes across surveys.
  - Publication lineage includes major CS reports (1990 main report; 1998/2000 updates; 2007 UK results).

- Challenges and considerations for data support
  - Ensuring representative sampling across multiple countries with devolved governance (England, Wales, Scotland) and dealing with changes in land classification over time.
  - Handling patchy data and data integration across systems and years.
  - Maintaining precision of country-specific estimates, particularly for Wales, through additional sub-classes and increased sample sizes.
  - Recognizing that changing the underlying land-class framework affects cross-survey comparability and national estimates.
