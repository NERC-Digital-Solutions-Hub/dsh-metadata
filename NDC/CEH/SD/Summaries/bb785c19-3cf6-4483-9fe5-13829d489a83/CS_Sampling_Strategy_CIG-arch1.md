# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- An historical, data-driven account of how Countryside Survey field sampling has been designed and updated over time, anchored to the ITE Land Classification.
- Emphasises the goal of obtaining representative, nationally comparable ecological and landscape data at various geographic scales (GB-wide and country-specific).

## Overview: purpose and guiding concepts

- The Countryside Survey field sampling uses a stratified, random design to ensure samples represent the variation across Great Britain.
- Stratification is achieved via the ITE Land Classification, which groups land by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to form distinct classes.
- Early sampling aimed to balance efficiency (survey within a field season) with statistical representativeness, using 1 km squares as the sampling unit.
- National estimates are derived by combining per-square data with the area of each land class, and later adapted to support country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales alone).

## The ITE Land Classification: development and role

- Originated in the 1970s (Bunce and Shaw) to classify land based on environmental attributes rather than purely biological data.
- First version (1978) produced 32 land classes from a core set of environmental variables, using 1 km squares and surrounding squares for context.
- The Land Classification serves as the sampling framework: sample sizes and locations are allocated across classes to capture ecological variability.
- Successive improvements expanded the classification from 32 to 40 classes (1990) and then to 45 classes (2007) to support more detailed country-specific reporting.
- For national estimates, a consistent linkage between land class areas and per-class sample data is essential, and changes in classification affect comparability across surveys.

## Timeline and key surveys

- 1978 CS1978: Initial Land Classification with 32 classes; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class); Ireland/UK mapping context not yet separated.
- 1984 CS1984: Second field survey; 384 squares surveyed (12 per class, per the 1978 framework); enhanced sampling but still based on the original classification.
- 1990 CS1990: All Squares Land Classification implemented; 508 squares surveyed; introduced a Land Cover Map (GB-wide) and urban/sea corrections; sampling expanded to accommodate broader regional needs.
- 1998 CS1998/CS2000: Revised Land Classification and broader UK reporting; 40 land classes; enabled separate reporting for Scotland.
  - CS2000: Separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); added class subdivisions and aggregations to improve country-specific representation; a Welsh uplands module was introduced to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
- 2007 CS2007: Further adjustments for Wales-only reporting and Wales-specific data needs.
  - Welsh-only estimates: introduced country-unit sub-divisions (creating 5 new Welsh-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); increased Wales sampling to ensure adequate representation (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class); England adjustments preserved but with some classes reduced in sample size.
  - England, Wales, Scotland sampling map updated to reflect new country-unit structure and updated class maps.

## Sampling framework and the field surveys: core numbers

- 1978 (CS1978): 256 squares; 32 classes; 8 squares per class.
- 1984 (CS1984): 384 squares; 12 per class; expanded but still based on original Land Classification.
- 1990 (CS1990): 508 squares; all GB squares reclassified under a revised All Squares framework; urban/sea corrections applied.
- 2000 (CS2000): 569 squares; 40 Land Classes; introduced separate country estimates and uplands module; more Welsh and country-specific sampling allocated (England & Wales and Scotland as reporting units).
- 2007 (CS2007): 591 squares total; 45 Land Classes (Welsh sub-classes added); country-unit reporting strengthened (England with Wales, Scotland, Wales-only when needed); additional Welsh squares and upland blocks to improve precision.
- Country-level breakdown (illustrative): CS2007 totals – England around 288 squares, Scotland around 196 squares, Wales around 107 squares; broader GB total approximately 591 squares.

## National estimates, country reporting, and uplands

- National estimates depend on the Land Classification and the per-square measurements within each class.
- To support policy and governance needs, country-specific reporting was introduced (England with Wales, Scotland) and later Wales-only reporting was implemented for CS2007.
- An uplands module (CS2000) added 30 squares within upland/marginal upland land classes to improve habitat estimates in England and Wales.
- The approach allows tailored estimates for different political and administrative units, while maintaining alignment with the overarching GB framework.

## Data, comparability, and practical considerations

- The series shows a tension between updating the Land Classification for improved ecological relevance and maintaining comparability with earlier surveys.
- When switching classifications, national estimates can diverge because the basis for estimation changes; thus, the report notes that older national estimates may use earlier classifications for cross-survey comparability, while current surveys use the latest classification for country-specific accuracy.
- The methodology underscores the importance of consistent data collection, documentation, and metadata to keep datasets usable and discoverable for future analyses.
