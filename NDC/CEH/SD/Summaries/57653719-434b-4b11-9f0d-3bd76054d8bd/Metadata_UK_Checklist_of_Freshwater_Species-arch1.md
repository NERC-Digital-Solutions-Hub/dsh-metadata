# METADATA FOR 'UK CHECKLIST OF FRESHWATER SPECIES' DATASET

## Aim and scope
- Consolidates all freshwater-associated species in the UK (excluding algae) to enable querying via the Biological Records Centre (BRC) and the UK Lakes Portal.
- Aims to update the freshwater species list supplied to UKSI partners (e.g., Recorder 6, NBN Atlas, iRecord).
- Conducted 2015–2017 under the NEC Highlights Hydroscape project; primary authors include Iain Gunn, Laurence Carvalho, Chris Raper, Gavin Siriwardena, and Ian Winfield.

## Collaboration and provenance
- Collaboration among CEH Edinburgh, Natural History Museum (NHM), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and CEH Lancaster.
- Based on multiple historical lists and databases, with continuous input from past colleagues.
- Related to updating and querying freshwater data through the UK Lakes Portal and UKSI.

## Data structure and coding
- Structured according to NHM coding requirements with main columns: TAXON_GROUP_NAME, TAXON_LIST_KEY, TAXON_LIST_VERSION_KEY, TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY, TAXON_VERSION_KEY, PREFERRED NAME, SORT_CODE, TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY LONG_NAME, ITEM_NAME, AUTHORITY.
- Designed to be interoperable with UKSI master lists and related datasets.

## Freshwater groups and inclusion
- Eight major groups identified: algae, amphibians, birds, fish, invertebrates, macrophytes, mammals, reptiles.
- Algae excluded from the main checklist (algae under revision); other microorganisms excluded.
- Freshwater species require confirmed wild UK records and a broad definition of freshwater (ditches, lakes, ponds, rivers, wetlands, etc.).

## Group-specific notes and counts
- Algae: Not included; updated freshwater algae inventory is in progress.
- Amphibians: 20 freshwater species included; 6 native, others introduced; Pelophylax lessonae may have been native to Norfolk.
- Birds: 194 species/sub-species in association with UK fresh waters; base UKSI bird list plus 107 entries plus 17 additional species; includes relevant subspecies; focuses on regularly occurring or breeding species, excludes vagrants.
- Fish: Two informal groups—jawless (Agnatha) and bony fish (Actinopterygii).
  - Jawless: 3 native freshwater lampreys.
  - Bony fish: 100 taxa (80 species; ~38 non-native; 19 hybrids; 1 subspecies). Some non-native species added from Britton et al. (2010). Includes species that tolerate brackish conditions.
  - Notable nomenclature update: European bitterling now Rhodeus amarus (not R. sericeus).
- Invertebrates: The largest group (~5810 taxa) split into 28 subgroups (e.g., Diptera with ~2134 taxa being the largest subgroup). Based on the Davies/Edwards/Maitland/Furse freshwater invertebrate code list (updated 2011) and UKSI matching; some discrepancies resolved via nomenclature checks.
- Macrophytes: 2216 taxa across nine subgroups (clubmoss, fern, flowering plant, horsetail, lichen, liverwort, moss, quillwort, stonewort); flowering plants dominate with 1249 taxa. Compiled from EU freshwater macrophyte lists and cross-checked with major floras (e.g., Preston & Croft; Preston et al.).
- Mammals: 8 species; 4 non-native; beaver (Castor fiber) reintroduced/escaped and reclassified as native in Scotland.
- Reptiles: 6 species and 1 subspecies; all but one non-native; native grass snake (Natrix natrix) is an exception.

## Data sources and validation
- UK Species Inventory (UKSI) master list used as baseline; cross-checked with NBN database for non-native status and nomenclature.
- Invertebrate list aligned with CEH-curated Davies/Edwards/Maitland/Furse list (2011) and updated against UKSI.
- Invasive/non-native species informed by UKTAG classifications.
- Additional updates drawn from Water Framework Directive monitoring lists and specialist literature.

## Usage, access, and maintenance
- Dataset designed to be queryable via BRC and the UK Lakes Portal (eip.ceh.ac.uk/apps/lakes/).
- Aims to keep datasets discoverable with metadata; ongoing updates to UKSI, UKSI-compatible portals, and iRecord connections.
- Maintained through collaboration among institutions and expert input, with explicit notes on nomenclature changes and group-specific selections.
