# METADATA FOR 'UK CHECKLIST OF FRESHWATER SPECIES' DATASET

## Purpose and scope
- New collation of all freshwater-associated species in the UK (excluding algae), created 2015–2017.
- Aims: enable querying freshwater species data in the Biological Records Centre (BRC); query via the UK Lakes Portal; update freshwater species lists for UKSI partners (Recorder 6, NBN Atlas, iRecord).
- Broad definition: taxa associated with or occurring in fresh waters (ditches, lakes, ponds, pools, riparian zones, rivers, streams, wetlands, etc.).
- Focus on verified records of occurrence in the wild in the UK.

## Provenance and authors
- Compiled by Iain Gunn (CEH Edinburgh) with Laurence Carvalho (CEH Edinburgh), Chris Raper (NHM), Gavin Siriwardena (BTO), Ian Winfield (CEH Lancaster); linked to the NERC Highlights Hydroscape project (NEC05609).
- Structured to align with NHM coding requirements and UK freshwater monitoring practices (e.g., Water Framework Directive).
- Data cross-checked with external sources (NBN, UKSI, UKTAG) to resolve nomenclature and native/non-native status where applicable.

## Data structure and fields
- Main columns follow NHM coding requirements:
  - TAXON_GROUP_NAME
  - TAXON_LIST_KEY
  - TAXON_LIST_VERSION_KEY
  - TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY
  - TAXON_VERSION_KEY
  - PREFERRED NAME
  - SORT_CODE
  - TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY LONG_NAME
  - ITEM_NAME
  - AUTHORITY

## Freshwater groups and scope
- Eight major groups identified for freshwater association:
  - algae (excluded from the checklist)
  - amphibians
  - birds
  - fish
  - invertebrates
  - macrophytes
  - mammals
  - reptiles
- Algae are not included; microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are not included.
- All taxa were edited from the UKSI master list and grouped using current freshwater monitoring lists, expert judgement, and literature, with attention to recent non-native arrivals.
- Invertebrates form the largest grouping; macrophytes are the second largest.

## Notable inclusions and definitions by group
- Amphibians: 20 freshwater species; 6 native; rest introduced; Pelophylax lessonae may have been native to Norfolk.
- Birds: freshwater component based on UKSI birds plus an expanded list to include regularly occurring or breeding-adjacent species; total around 194 species/sub-species considered (excluding rare vagrants).
- Fish: two informal groups:
  - Jawless (Agnatha): 3 native freshwater lampreys.
  - Bony fish (Actinopterygii): about 100 taxa (80 species; ~38 non-native; 34 flagged in UKSI); 19 hybrids; 1 subspecies; includes some brackish-tolerant taxa (e.g., Mugil cephalus, Sprattus sprattus) and updated nomenclature (e.g., Rhodeus amarus for European bitterling).
- Invertebrates: ~5810 taxa across 28 informal groups (e.g., Coleoptera, Diptera largest with 2134 taxa).
- Macrophytes: ~2216 taxa, subdivided into nine groups; flowering plants are the largest subgroup (≈1249 taxa); compilation based on EU taxa lists and British floras.
- Mammals: 8 species; 4 non-native; beaver reintroduced/escaped and now reclassified as native in Scotland.
- Reptiles: 6 species + 1 subspecies; most are non-native except the native grass snake (Natrix natrix).

## Data sources, validation, and nomenclature
- Core basis: UKSI master list; freshwater invertebrate code list (Davies/Edwards/Maitland/Furse) updated to 2011 and matched to UKSI.
- Nomenclature checks with NBN; consideration of non-native status (via UKTAG and related literature, e.g., Britton et al., 2010).
- Special notes on taxonomy (e.g., Rhodeus amarus vs. R. sericeus; beaver reclassification in Scotland) to ensure current scientific naming.

## Use and accessibility
- Designed to be queried within the BRC framework and via the UK Lakes Portal.
- Also intended to feed freshwater species data to UKSI partners (e.g., Recorder 6, NBN Atlas, iRecord).
- Aims to support standardized monitoring outputs and cross-dataset analyses.

## Update status and future work
- Algae: excluded due to ongoing revision; updated freshwater algae inventory being developed (David John, NHM).
- The dataset reflects the best available comprehensive, UK-wide freshwater species list with clear criteria for inclusion and cross-referenced nomenclature and native status.
