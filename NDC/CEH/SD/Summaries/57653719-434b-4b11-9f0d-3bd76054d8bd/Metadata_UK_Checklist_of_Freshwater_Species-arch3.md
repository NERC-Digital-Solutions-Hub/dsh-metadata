# METADATA FOR 'UK CHECKLIST OF FRESHWATER SPECIES' DATASET

## Overview and purpose
- New collation of all UK freshwater-associated species (excluding algae) assembled 2015–2017.
- Aims to enable querying of freshwater species data in the Biological Records Centre (BRC) and via the UK Lakes Portal; produce data suitable for UKSI partners (Recorder 6, NBN Atlas, iRecord).

## Authorship and collaboration
- Led by Iain Gunn (CEH Edinburgh) with Laurence Carvalho (CEH Edinburgh), Chris Raper (NHM), Gavin Siriwardena (BTO), Ian Winfield (CEH Lancaster).
- Associated with the NERC Highlights Hydroscape project (NEC05609); all listed as joint authors.

## Dataset structure and metadata format
- Structured to NHM coding requirements with main columns: 
  TAXON_GROUP_NAME, TAXON_LIST_KEY, TAXON_LIST_VERSION_KEY, TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY, TAXON_VERSION_KEY, PREFERRED NAME, SORT_CODE, TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY LONG_NAME, ITEM_NAME, AUTHORITY.
- Eight major freshwater groups identified (algae excluded; microorganisms excluded): amphibians, birds, fish, invertebrates, macrophytes, mammals, reptiles; algae not included.

## Inclusion criteria and freshwater definition
- Freshwater species defined as taxa associated with or occurring in freshwater habitats (ditches, lakes, ponds, pools, riparian zones, rivers/streams, wetlands, etc.).
- Only taxa with confirmed records in the wild in the UK included.
- Algae excluded due to ongoing revisions; updated freshwater algae inventory being prepared by NHM.

## Group-specific details and notable points
- Algae: not included; updated freshwater algae inventory in progress.
- Amphibians: 20 freshwater species; 6 native; remaining introduced; Pelophylax lessonae possibly native to Norfolk.
- Birds: freshwater component includes 194 species/subspecies regularly occurring or breeding in association with UK fresh waters; compiled from UKSI bird list plus 17 extra species; excludes vagrants; threshold for inclusion discussed with BTO.
- Fish: 100 taxa total; 80 bony fishes (Actinopterygii) including 38 non-native; 19 hybrids; 1 subspecies; some taxa brackish-tolerant; non-native species added from Britton et al. (2010); taxonomic note on Rhodeus amarus vs R. sericeus clarified.
- Invertebrates: ~5810 taxa across 28 groups; largest subgroup is Diptera (true flies) with 2134 taxa; compiled from CEH Davies/Edwards/Maitland/Furse list and UKSI alignment; discrepancies resolved via nomenclature checks and NBN records.
- Macrophytes: 2216 taxa across 9 subgroups; flowering plants are the largest subgroup (1249); constructed from EU taxa list and cross-checked with British floras; mosses/liverworts and lichens checked against standard references.
- Mammals: 8 species; 4 non-native; beaver (Castor fiber) reintroduced/escaped and now considered native in Scotland.
- Reptiles: 6 species + 1 subspecies; majority non-native except the native grass snake (Natrix natrix).

## Data sources, validation, and integration
- Primary data sources: UKSI (UK Species Inventory), NBN Atlas, Recorder 6, UK Lakes Portal.
- Veterinary/biological sources and cross-checks: Water Framework Directive groupings, UKTAG alien species classification; invertebrate list based on CEH-curated Davies/Edwards/Maitland/Furse list; taxonomic and nomenclature checks with NBN and literature.

## Data governance, usage, and caveats
- Data compiled to support querying and integration across monitoring platforms; ensures data provenance via originators and cross-references with UKSI/NBN.
- Some nomenclature changes and native-status updates noted (e.g., Rhodeus amarus; beaver native status in Scotland).
- Algae and microorganisms deliberately excluded pending revision; brackish tolerance included for some taxa in fish group; vagrants typically excluded from bird list.
- Emphasis on confirming records in the wild within the UK and aligning with established taxonomic standards and monitoring literature.
