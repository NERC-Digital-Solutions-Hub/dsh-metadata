METADATA FOR 'UK CHECKLIST OF FRESHWATER SPECIES' DATASET

- Purpose and scope
  - A comprehensive collation of all freshwater-associated species in the UK (excluding algae and microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, viruses).
  - Compiled 2015–2017 to enable querying freshwater species data in the Biological Records Centre (BRC) and via the UK Lakes Portal; also to update the freshwater species list in UK Species Inventory (UKSI) partners such as Recorder 6, NBN Atlas, and iRecord.
  - Authors include Iain Gunn, Laurence Carvalho, Chris Raper, Gavin Siriwardena, Ian Winfield; linked to the NERC Highlights Hydroscape project.
  - Dataset aims to support data discovery, consistency in nomenclature, and integration with UKSI and related databases.

- Data structure and coding
  - Structured according to NHM coding requirements with main columns: TAXON_GROUP_NAME, TAXON_LIST_KEY, TAXON_LIST_VERSION_KEY, TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY, TAXON_VERSION_KEY, PREFERRED NAME, SORT_CODE, TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY LONG_NAME, ITEM_NAME, AUTHORITY.
  - Eight major freshwater-associated groups identified: algae (excluded), amphibians, birds, fish, invertebrates, macrophytes, mammals, reptiles.
  - Separate tabular lists for each group were created in Excel before being combined; taxa were edited from the UKSI master list and aligned with current monitoring lists and expert judgement.

- Group-specific highlights
  - Algae: excluded from the main checklist; updated NBN Inventory for freshwater algae is underway separately.
  - Amphibians: 20 freshwater species; 6 native, the rest introduced; one native-to-be regionally considered (Pelophylax lessonae) possibly native to Norfolk.
  - Birds: built from UKSI bird list plus a BTO-augmented list; total includes 194 species/sub-species considered regularly occurring or breeding in association with UK freshwater habitats (excludes most visitors/vagrants).
  - Fish: divided into bony fish (Actinopterygii) and jawless fish (Agnatha); 100 bony taxa (80 species, ~38 non-native; 34 flagged in UKSI), 19 hybrids, 1 subspecies; includes some brackish-tolerant species; incorporates non-native introductions per Britton et al. (2010) and clarifications like Rhodeus amarus vs. R. sericeus.
  - Invertebrates: largest group (~5810 taxa) across 28 informal subgroups; major subgroup Diptera with 2134 taxa; based on Davies/Edwards/Maitland/Furse list (updated 2011) and UKSI alignment; nomenclature verification against UKSI and potential discrepancies noted.
  - Macrophytes: 2216 taxa across nine informal groups; flowering plants most numerous; compiled from EU freshwater macrophyte lists and cross-checked with major British floras and bryophyte/lichen references.
  - Mammals: eight species; four non-native; beaver reclassified as native in Scotland following reintroduction/escape.
  - Reptiles: six species plus one subspecies; most are non-native except the native grass snake (Natrix natrix).

- Inclusion criteria and scope
  - Only freshwater taxa with confirmed wild records in the UK are included.
  - Freshwater definition encompasses taxa associated with or occurring in freshwater environments (ditches, lakes, ponds, pools, riparian zones, rivers, streams, wetlands, etc.).
  - Algae and other microorganisms excluded due to separate revisions and inventories.
  - Group composition reflects integration with UK freshwater monitoring lists, specialist literature, and expert judgement, including considerations of non-native/invasive species (via UKTAG guidance).

- Data provenance and validation
  - Primary data sources include UK freshwater monitoring literature, UKSI master list, NBN database for nomenclature checks, and UKTAG invasive species classifications.
  - Efforts made to ensure taxa are present in the wild in the UK; updates reflect taxonomic changes and contemporary classification (e.g., Rhodeus amarus vs. R. sericeus).

- Usage, governance, and dissemination
  - The dataset is designed to enable querying of freshwater species data across BRC and the UK Lakes Portal, with updates coordinated back to UKSI partners.
  - Structured to support interoperability with UKSI and related databases and to facilitate data discovery, metadata adequacy, and potential future expansions (e.g., algae updates).
