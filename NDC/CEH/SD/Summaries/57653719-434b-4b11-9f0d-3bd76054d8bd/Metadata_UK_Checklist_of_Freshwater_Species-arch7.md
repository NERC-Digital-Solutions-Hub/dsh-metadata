# METADATA FOR 'UK CHECKLIST OF FRESHWATER SPECIES' DATASET

## Aim and purpose
- Consolidates all freshwater-associated species in the UK (excluding algae) for querying in the Biological Records Centre (BRC) and via the UK Lakes Portal.
- Enables updates to UK Species Inventory (UKSI) partners (Recorder 6, NBN Atlas, iRecord).
- Supports map-based data visualisations and spatial querying for GIS users.

## Authors and provenance
- Compiled 2015–2017 by Iain Gunn (CEH Edinburgh) with Laurence Carvalho (CEH Edinburgh), Chris Raper (NHM), Gavin Siriwardena (BTO), and Ian Winfield (CEH Lancaster).
- Primarily under the NERC Highlights Hydroscape project (NEC05609); broader collaboration with UKSI and NBN resources.

## Data structure and coding
- Structured according to NHM coding requirements with main columns:
  TAXON_GROUP_NAME, TAXON_LIST_KEY, TAXON_LIST_VERSION_KEY, TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY, TAXON_VERSION_KEY, PREFERRED NAME, SORT_CODE, TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY LONG_NAME, ITEM_NAME, AUTHORITY.
- Eight major freshwater groups identified; algaes excluded (being revised separately).
- Data prepared in Excel as separate tables per group before being merged into a master list.
- Designed to align with UK freshwater monitoring lists (e.g., Water Framework Directive) and expert taxonomic judgement; includes cross-checks with UKSI and NBN.

## Taxonomic scope (eight major freshwater groups)
- Algae: excluded (updated freshwater algae inventory in progress separately).
- Amphibians: 20 freshwater species (majority native; some introduced; one potential historic native in Norfolk).
- Birds: freshwater-associated birds compiled from UKSI bird list plus an expanded supplement; total around 194 species/sub-species considered regularly occurring or breeding in association with UK fresh waters.
- Fish: two informal groups (Actinopterygii and Agnatha); about 100 bony fish taxa (including hybrids and a subspecies), with substantial non-native representation; includes brackish-tolerant species occasionally recorded as freshwater.
- Invertebrates: largest group (~5810 taxa) spanning 28 sub-groups (e.g., Diptera, Coleoptera, Mollusca, Crustaceans, etc.).
- Macrophytes: ~2216 taxa across nine sub-groupings (flowering plants are the largest subgroup); rich in genera, species, hybrids, and varieties.
- Mammals: eight species; four non-native; beaver reclassified as native in Scotland.
- Reptiles: six species and one subspecies; most are non-native except the grass snake.

## Selection and compilation process
- Based on UKSI master list, current freshwater monitoring lists, and up-to-date specialist literature.
- Included new arrivals and non-native taxa using UKTAG alien species guidance; cross-verified against NBN for records and nomenclature.
- A broad definition of freshwater species applied: taxa associated with, living in, or near freshwaters (ditches, lakes, rivers, wetlands, etc.).
- Aimed to include species with confirmed wild UK records.

## Data sources and validation
- Key sources: UKSI master list, NBN database, Water Framework Directive monitoring lists, specialist literature, and expert judgement.
- Nomenclature issues resolved via cross-referencing with NBN and CEH Davies/Edwards/Maitland/Furse code lists.
- Notable taxonomic clarifications included (e.g., Rhodeus amarus vs. R. sericeus for European bitterling).

## Access and usage context
- The dataset supports querying freshwater species across the BRC and the UK Lakes Portal.
- Provides a structured, map-friendly basis for GIS workflows, including potential visualization of species groups, native vs non-native status, and geographic distribution within the UK.
