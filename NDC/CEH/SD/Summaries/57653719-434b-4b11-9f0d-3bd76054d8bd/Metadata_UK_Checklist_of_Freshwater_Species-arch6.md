# METADATA FOR 'UK CHECKLIST OF FRESHWATER SPECIES' DATASET

## Purpose and scope
- Compiles the UK Checklist of Freshwater Species (excluding algae) found in association with fresh waters in the UK.
- Aims to enable querying of freshwater species data in the Biological Records Centre (BRC) and via the UK Lakes Portal; also to update the freshwater species list supplied to UK Species Inventory (UKSI) partners (Recorder 6, NBN Atlas, iRecord).
- Created to support querying and data integration across multiple sources and to facilitate data sharing and reuse.

## Production and collaboration
- Compiled 2015–2017 by Iain Gunn (CEH Edinburgh) with Laurence Carvalho (CEH Edinburgh), Chris Raper (NHM), Gavin Siriwardena (BTO), and Ian Winfield (CEH Lancaster).
- Primarily under the NERC Highlights Hydroscape project (NEC05609).
- Invertebrate component updated by Iain Gunn, largely based on the 2011 Davies/Edwards/Maitland/Furse invertebrate code list, with contributions from past colleagues listed as joint dataset authors.
- Outputs are designed to be queried through BRC and the UK Lakes Portal and to be shared with UKSI partners (e.g., Recorder 6, NBN Atlas, iRecord).

## Dataset structure and key fields
- Structured according to NHM coding requirements.
- Main columns include: TAXON_GROUP_NAME, TAXON_LIST_KEY, TAXON_LIST_VERSION_KEY, TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY, TAXON_VERSION_KEY, PREFERRED NAME, SORT_CODE, TAXON_LIST_ITEM_KEY LONG_NAME, ITEM_NAME, AUTHORITY.

## Taxonomic groups and overall scope
- Eight major freshwater-associated groups identified: algae, amphibians, birds, fish, invertebrates, macrophytes, mammals, reptiles.
- Algae are not included in the UK Checklist of Freshwater Species (undergoing major revision); microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are also not included.
- For the other groups, separate tabular lists were created in Excel and then combined.

## Data sources, selection criteria, and quality checks
- Taxa were selected based on association with freshwater habitats (ditches, lakes, ponds, rivers, wetlands, etc.) in the UK and verified as occurring in the wild within the UK.
- Definitions and status (native vs non-native) were aligned with up-to-date specialist literature, expert judgement, and relevant lists (e.g., UK freshwater monitoring policies, UKTAG non-native species list).
- Non-native taxa were cross-checked against the NBN database and UKTAG references; nomenclature checks performed against UKSI.
- The dataset emphasizes taxa with confirmed wild UK records to ensure reliability.

## Group-specific highlights

- Amphibians
  - 20 freshwater amphibian species included; 6 native, the rest introduced (one exception: Pelophylax lessonae may have been native to Norfolk in the past).

- Birds
  - Freshwater component derived from the UKSI bird list, augmented by a BTO list; total of 194 species/sub-species considered regularly occurring or now occasional breeders in association with UK fresh waters.
  - Excludes occasional vagrants/visitors.

- Fish
  - Divided into two informal groups: Actinopterygii (bony fishes) and Agnatha (jawless fishes).
  - Actinopterygii includes 80 species, 38 non-native (34 flagged in UKSI), 19 hybrids, and 1 subspecies.
  - Brackish-tolerant species included if they can appear in freshwater records (e.g., Mugil cephalus, Sprattus sprattus).
  - Non-native introductions listed in Britton et al. (2010) incorporated; nomenclature notes include Rhodeus amarus vs. R. sericeus for the European bitterling.

- Invertebrates
  - Largest group with ~5810 taxa (genera, species, subspecies) across 28 informal groups (e.g., Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Mollusca, Crustaceans, etc.).
  - Built from the CEH-curated Davies/Edwards/Maitland/Furse freshwater invertebrate code list (2011) and aligned to the UKSI master list; resolved nomenclature and inclusion discrepancies.
  - Emphasizes wide representation across major invertebrate taxa found in UK freshwater systems.

- Macrophytes
  - Second-largest group with 2216 taxa (genera, species, subspecies, hybrids, aggregates, varieties) associated with freshwater habitats.
  - Subdivided into nine informal groups (clubmoss, fern, flowering plant, horsetail, lichen, liverwort, moss, quillwort, stonewort).
  - Basis includes EU freshwater macrophyte taxa, cross-checked against British floras (e.g., Preston & Croft; Preston et al.).

- Mammals
  - Eight freshwater-associated mammal species included; four are non-native.
  - Beavers (Castor fiber) have been reintroduced/escaped and are now considered native in Scotland.

- Reptiles
  - Six species (plus one subspecies) included; all but the native grass snake (Natrix natrix) are non-native.

## Access, usage, and updates
- Data assembled to support querying via BRC and the UK Lakes Portal and to update UKSI partners.
- Updated outputs intended to promote data sharing and re-use, including potential refinement of outputs based on feedback.
- The dataset reflects a broad, inclusive definition of freshwater species to support diverse policy, monitoring, and biodiversity activities.

## Limitations and caveats
- Algae are excluded due to ongoing revisions; freshwater microbial groups are not included.
- Some taxonomic nuances and nomenclature changes (e.g., bitterling naming) are noted and resolved within the dataset context.
- The dataset emphasizes confirmed wild UK occurrences; records of casual or non-wild presence are not the basis for inclusion.
