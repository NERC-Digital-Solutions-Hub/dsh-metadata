Chemical Exposure and Stress Responses in UK Fish. Pottinger, T. G., Matthiessen, P . (2017)

## Aim
- Assess whether the complex chemical milieu downstream of wastewater treatment works (WWTWs) affects the stress axis in three-spined sticklebacks.
- Quantify stress indicators to evaluate environmental health status and potential policy implications.

## Study Design and Sampling Regime
- Locations: sites downstream of WWTWs and reference sites with no identifiable WWTW input in north-west England.
- Species: three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.).
- Sampling periods: 2011, 2013, 2014.
- Sampling approach: capture fish using nets, with immediate processing of unstressed individuals and a designated stressed group exposed to confinement prior to processing.
- Stress protocol: confinement periods (30–60 minutes) designed to achieve peak cortisol release; cortisol measured in whole body and in water after confinement; glucose measured in homogenate.
- Water handling: use of artificial freshwater for cortisol collection to minimise turbidity and interference.
- Controls: included CEH aquarium control population sampled with a similar procedure.

## Data Collected and Indicators
- Biological metrics: weight (mg), total length (mm), sex, and condition factor (K = 100*weight/length).
- Stress indicators:
  - Whole-body cortisol (ng/g bw)
  - Cortisol released to water during confinement (CRTW, pg/g/h)
  - Whole-body glucose (mg/g bw)
- Sampling state: stressed (post-confinement) vs. unstressed (immediately after capture).
- Processing state: partially thawed tissue processed with standardized homogenization and extraction protocols.

## Laboratory Processing and Analytical Procedures
- Cortisol: extraction from tissue homogenate using ethyl acetate; quantification by cortisol radioimmunoassay (RIA) with validated antibodies and radiolabeled tracer.
- Glucose: measured using a microplate hexokinase assay.
- Water cortisol: inline extraction from water samples using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges, eluates analyzed by RIA.
- Quality control: blanks and recovery standards included with batches; samples stored at -70°C (tissue) and -20°C (water extracts) prior to processing.
- Data integrity: standardized sample handling, timing, and storage to ensure comparability across sites and years.

## Data Structure and Access
- Data provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file with the following columns:
  - Sample_date, WWTW_name, River, Stressed_or_Unstressed, Weight_mg, Length_mm, Condition_factor, Sex, Whole_body_cortisol_ng_g_bw, Whole_body_glucose_mg_g_bw, CRTW_pg_g_h
- Clear documentation of each column’s meaning, units, and measurement context to support reuse and aggregation.

## Sampling Locations and Coverage
- Site details include upstream vs. downstream designation, WWTW discharge points, and population served by each WWTW.
- Comprehensive site list covers multiple rivers and tributaries, enabling comparisons between downstream exposure and upstream/reference conditions.

## Relevance to Environmental Monitoring and Policy
- Demonstrates how fish stress physiology can serve as an environmental sentinel for effluent exposure.
- Provides standardised data collection and processing methods suitable for integration into monitoring programs and trend analyses over time.
- Data structure and storage facilitate sharing and reuse, aligning with objectives to increase dataset value and enable access to underlying data.
