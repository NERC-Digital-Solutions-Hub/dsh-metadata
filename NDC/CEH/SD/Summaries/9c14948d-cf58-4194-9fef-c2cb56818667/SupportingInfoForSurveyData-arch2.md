# Supporting information for interpreting

- Overview
  - Describes experimental design, sampling regime, and data collection for social science surveys linked to understanding knowledge learning dynamics and preferences among local stakeholders in Chinese catchment areas.
  - Focuses on linking social survey data with environmental monitoring and policy interpretation.

- Study context and aims
  - Two social science surveys conducted between 2016 and 2018 in Chinese villages with distinct landscapes (karst and red soil).
  - Aimed to capture perspectives from four governance levels: county leaders, town leaders/village leaders, and individual farmers.
  - Data collected to support interpretation of environmental knowledge uptake, policy relevance, and management practices.

- Survey instruments and methods
  - Primary method: questionnaires (closed and open-ended). Interviews conducted but not yet deposited; questionnaires are the main deposited data.
  - Data collected to fulfil multiple aims, including understanding knowledge learning, farming practices, policy awareness, and interactions with scientists.
  - Additional contextual information available in official project reports (Zheng et al. 2017; Zheng et al. 2018).

- Sampling and sites
  - Locations selected among towns/villages within or around studied catchments with strong support from local leadership and proximity to research/monitoring stations.
  - Landscapes covered: karst (Puding) and red soil (Yujiang).
  - 2016 surveys included multiple stakeholder groups; 2018 surveys focused on farmers and county leaders in specified areas.
  - Sample sizes (illustrative): 2016 Puding Karst Farmers (n=312), County Leaders (n=15), Town/Village Leaders (n=32); 2018 Puding Karst Farmers (n=40); 2018 Yujiang Red Soil Farmers (n=117) and County Leaders (n=3). Additional 2nd-wave data collected for Yujiang and Puding.

- Data collection logistics
  - Fieldwork involved local undergraduate students and villagers to assist with survey administration.
  - Data structure comprises six files for the first survey wave in Puding, with additional files for other waves/sites.

- Data structure and content
  - Files for Survey1st_Puding include:
    - Survey1st_Puding_CountyLeaders.csv
    - Survey1st_Puding_Farmers.csv
    - Survey1st_Puding_TownVillageLeaders.csv
  - Files for other waves/sites include Survey2nd_Puding_Farmers.csv, Survey2nd_Yujiang_CountyLeaders.csv, Survey2nd_Yujiang_Farmers.csv
  - Each file contains coded questions (e.g., Q1–Q32) and corresponding demographic or response variables; detailed column definitions are provided in accompanying tables.
  - Data types include demographic information (gender, age, education), training and information sources, policy awareness, farming practices, environmental concerns, and knowledge transfer with scientists and government.

- Analytical methods
  - Questionnaire data analyzed with statistical tools (Minitab).
  - Tests for associations and differences at p < 0.05 (95% CI) using:
    - Chi-square tests for associations between demographics/locations and survey responses.
    - 2-sample proportional tests where appropriate.
  - Quality control emphasizes diversity of landscapes and villages to strengthen result rigor.

- Data management and availability
  - Primary deposition: questionnaire data (interview data to be deposited later).
  - Data quality control through varied landscapes and sampling to improve robustness.
  - Contextual references available for methodological and governance aspects (Zheng et al. 2017; Zheng et al. 2018).

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy
  - Provides standardized, QA-aware social data to interpret environmental health concepts, knowledge uptake, and policy interactions at local levels.
  - Enables linking social learning and stakeholder perspectives with environmental monitoring outputs and governance responses.
  - Addresses challenges related to data value and accessibility by documenting data structure, collection methods, and analysis approaches for reuse and integration with other environmental datasets.
