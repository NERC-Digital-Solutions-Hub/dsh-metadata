# Supporting information for interpreting

- Aim and scope
  - Documents social surveys (2016–2018) in Chinese rural villages to understand knowledge learning dynamics and preferences among local stakeholders, informing water/farm management and policy uptake across two landscapes (karst and red soil).
- Study design and setting
  - Two landscapes: karst (Puding County) and red soil (Yujiang County).
  - Four levels of governance surveyed: county leaders, town/village leaders, and individual farmers; interviews and questionnaires used (questionnaire data deposited; interview data to be deposited later).
  - Local research and monitoring stations were located in the surveyed areas to facilitate participation.
- Data collection methods
  - Primary method: social science questionnaires with closed and open-ended questions; interviews used but not yet deposited.
  - Fieldwork involved local undergraduates and villagers for survey administration.
  - Calibration steps: not applicable (N/A).
- Sample details and response counts
  - 2016 (Puding, Karst)
    - Farmers: 312 respondents
    - County Leaders: 15 respondents
    - Town/Village Leaders: 32 respondents
  - 2018 (Puding, Karst; farmers only listed)
    - Farmers: 40 respondents
  - 2018 (Yujiang, Red soil)
    - Farmers: 117 respondents
    - County Leaders: 3 respondents
- Data structure and files
  - Dataset comprises six CSV files:
    1) Survey1st_Puding_CountyLeaders.csv
    2) Survey1st_Puding_Farmers.csv
    3) Survey1st_Puding_TownVillageLeaders.csv
    4) Survey2nd_Puding_Farmers.csv
    5) Survey2nd_Yujiang_CountyLeaders.csv
    6) Survey2nd_Yujiang_Farmers.csv
  - Each file contains survey questions (Q1, Q2, …) and coded responses (e.g., gender, age, education, training, policy involvement, sources of information, farming practices, environmental knowledge). Descriptions and exact codings are provided in the accompanying tables within the dataset.
- Analytical methods
  - Statistical analyses conducted with Minitab.
  - Assessed associations/differences at p < 0.05 (95% CI).
  - Tests used include Chi-square for associations between residence/village and sociodemographic characteristics; supported by 2-sample proportion tests where appropriate.
- Data quality, provenance, and availability
  - Sampling across multiple landscapes and villages to enhance rigor and representativeness.
  - Data quality notes: questionnaire-based data; interview data to be deposited later; diversification across landscapes improves robustness.

  - Data accessibility and reuse
    - Questionnaire data deposited and described; interview data will be deposited when ready.
    - Researchers are encouraged to consult the metadata tables for exact variable coding and structure.
- Practical implications for analysts
  - The data enable analysis of knowledge learning dynamics, information sources, training needs, policy communication, and farmer/policy interactions across landscapes and governance levels.
  - Potential to model relationships between demographics, information sources, training, and adoption or monitoring of policies and environmental practices.
