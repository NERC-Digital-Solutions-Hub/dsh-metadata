# Supporting information for interpreting

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides supporting information for interpreting a study of social surveys in Chinese rural villages to understand knowledge learning dynamics and preferences among local stakeholders.
  - Aimed at informing policy, monitoring approaches, and future decision-making in environmental health contexts.

- Study setting and timeline
  - Conducted 2016–2018 in two landscape contexts: karst (Puding) and red soil (Yujiang) within China.
  - Participants spanned four governance levels: county leaders, town/village leaders, and individual farmers (plus other roles as specified in the questionnaires).

- Survey design and data collection
  - Mixed-methods approach: questionnaires (main method) and interviews (to be deposited later).
  - Two waves of social science surveys:
    - 2016: first round in Puding (Karst) covering farmers, county leaders, and village/town leaders.
    - 2018: second round in Puding (farmers) and Yujiang (farmers and leaders) to broaden landscape coverage.
  - Data collected included both closed and open-ended questions; sample sizes varied by village and governance level.
  - Local undergraduates and villagers assisted with fieldwork.

- Data and data structure
  - Data files (structure and contents documented in detail):
    - Survey1st_Puding_CountyLeaders.csv
    - Survey1st_Puding_Farmers.csv
    - Survey1st_Puding_TownVillageLeaders.csv
    - Survey2nd_Puding_Farmers.csv
    - Survey2nd_Yujiang_CountyLeaders.csv
    - Survey2nd_Yujiang_Farmers.csv
  - Each file contains multiple questions (Q1, Q2, …) with detailed variable definitions (e.g., gender, age, job role, training, sources of information, policy engagement, etc.).
  - Additional contextual information referenced in official reports:
    - Zheng, Y. et al. 2017 (Puding Government KE project)
    - Zheng, Y. et al. 2018 (Yujiang Red Soil Knowledge Exchange project)
    - DOIs provided for both reports

- Data content and analytical approach
  - Question types include demographic items, knowledge and training exposure, sources of scientific information, policy engagement, and views on management practices.
  - Analytical methods:
    - Statistical analyses conducted with Minitab.
    - Associations/differences tested at the p < 0.05 level.
    - Chi-square tests used to explore associations between respondent characteristics and survey responses.
    - 2-sample proportional tests used where appropriate.
  - Data includes both qualitative and quantitative elements, with structure and column definitions documented for reproducibility.

- Data governance, availability, and limitations
  - At the time of deposit, only questionnaire data is publicly deposited; interview data will be added to the data repository when ready.
  - Emphasis on rigorous data collection across diverse landscapes and governance levels to inform monitoring and policy evaluation.
  - The documentation provides extensive metadata to facilitate reuse, though interviews remain forthcoming.

- Relevance to monitoring and policy decisions
  - The surveys capture stakeholder knowledge, learning dynamics, information sources, and responsiveness to scientific findings.
  - Findings can inform monitoring frameworks by identifying effective channels for knowledge transfer, policy communication, and evaluation of policy uptake among farmers and local authorities.
