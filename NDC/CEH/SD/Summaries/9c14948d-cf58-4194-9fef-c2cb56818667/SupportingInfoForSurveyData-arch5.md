# Supporting information for interpreting

- The document describes the experimental design, sampling regime, field methods, instrumentation, data structure, and quality control for social science surveys conducted in Chinese rural villages between 2016 and 2018. The studies focus on stakeholder knowledge, learning dynamics, and farming practices across karst and red soil landscapes.

- Study scope and participants
  - Surveys conducted in several Chinese villages, with four governance levels targeted: county leaders, town/village leaders, and individual farmers.
  - Villages were selected to align with areas where most research and monitoring stations are located and where local leaders supported the survey.
  - Data sources include questionnaires (main method) and interviews (to be deposited later).
  - Two landscape contexts: Karst (Puding) and Red Soil (Yujiang).

- Data collection and instruments
  - Questionnaires included both closed and open-ended questions; interviews planned for later deposition.
  - Fieldwork involved local undergraduates and villagers assisting with the surveys.
  - Data collection periods span 2016 and 2018, with detailed information per survey round (counts and file names provided in Table-like sections).

- Data files and structure
  - Survey1st_Puding_CountyLeaders.csv
  - Survey1st_Puding_Farmers.csv
  - Survey1st_Puding_TownVillageLeaders.csv
  - Survey2nd_Puding_Farmers.csv
  - Survey2nd_Yujiang_CountyLeaders.csv
  - Survey2nd_Yujiang_Farmers.csv
  - Each file contains structured questionnaire data with coded columns (e.g., Q1, Q2, etc.) and, for some files, location or demographic identifiers (e.g., village names, stakeholder type, etc.).
  - The datasets include a mix of demographic variables (gender, age, education), farm characteristics (farmed area, crops, livestock), knowledge and training sources, interactions with scientists and policymakers, policy awareness and implementation, environmental and water management topics, and attitudes toward training and policy support.

- Data content and coding concepts (highlights)
  - Demographics: gender, age, education, duration of farming, family size.
  - Farm and production: crops grown, livestock, water use, fertilizer and chemical use, environmental and water-related practices.
  - Knowledge and training: sources of farming knowledge (family, friends, government, universities, etc.), training received, interest in training, barriers to participation.
  - Policy and governance: written policies or guidance for farmers, how advice is shared, involvement with scientists or higher-scale government officials, monitoring and effectiveness of policies, regulation of farming activities.
  - Environmental context: awareness of karst/red soil, soil erosion knowledge, environmental risks (flooding, drought, landslides), water management.

- Data quality control and analysis
  - Quality control described as ensuring diverse landscapes and multiple villages to improve rigor.
  - Analytical methods noted for questionnaire data include statistical tests (Chi-square, two-sample proportional tests) with significance at p < 0.05.
  - Data processing details such as calibration steps are noted as not applicable (N/A) for certain items.

- Data governance, sharing, and provenance
  - At the time of deposition, only questionnaire data are deposited; interview data will be sorted and deposited when ready.
  - Datasets include explicit file names, sizes (ranging from a few KB to several tens of KB), and column-level details (e.g., Q1, Q2 with defined response categories).
  - Contextual and methodological references point to official reports from the China-UK Knowledge Exchange projects (Zheng et al. 2017; Zheng et al. 2018) for deeper background.
  - For data stewards, the material highlights the importance of thorough metadata, data dictionaries, and documentation to support reuse across researchers and policymakers.

- Practical notes for data stewardship
  - Preserve and publish rich metadata: dataset title, collection period, geographic scope, population, sampling frame, instrument details, variable definitions, codebooks, and file-level descriptions.
  - Maintain data provenance: link questionnaire files to the corresponding study round, landscape, and participant group; include references to official project reports.
  - Plan for iterative deposition: separate deposition of interview data and evidence of updates or additional waves as they become available.
  - Ensure interoperability: align coding schemes and variable names across files where possible; provide crosswalks for Q-numeric codes to human-readable labels.
