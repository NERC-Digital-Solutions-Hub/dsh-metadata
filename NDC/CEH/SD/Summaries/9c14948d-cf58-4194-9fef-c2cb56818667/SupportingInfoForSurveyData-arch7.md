# Supporting information for interpreting

- Overview
  - Social science surveys conducted in Chinese rural villages (2016–2018) to understand knowledge learning dynamics and preferences among local stakeholders.
  - Two landscapes studied: karst (Puding) and red soil (Yujiang). Respondents included county leaders, town/village leaders, and farmers.
  - Data available: questionnaire data deposited now; interview data to be deposited later. Tied to China-UK Karst Knowledge Exchange projects; related reports available with DOIs.

- Study design and sampling
  - Locations: Puding (karst) and Yujiang (red soil) catchments; villages selected by local researchers with leader support.
  - Participants by level: county leaders, town/village leaders, farmers; sample sizes varied by village population.
  - Wave structure: multiple survey elements across 2016 and 2018 (Survey1st and Survey2nd in Puding; Survey2nd in Yujiang), with ongoing data deposition for interview components.

- Data collection methods
  - Primary instruments: questionnaires (closed and open-ended) and interviews.
  - Data collectors: local undergraduates and villagers assisting with surveys.
  - Data processing: questionnaire data deposited; interview data will be sorted and stored when ready.
  - Analytical approach: statistical analyses in Minitab; associations/differences tested at p < 0.05, using Chi-square tests and 2-sample proportional tests where appropriate.

- Data structure and contents
  - Files (Survey1st Puding): six CSV files
    - Survey1st_Puding_CountyLeaders.csv
    - Survey1st_Puding_Farmers.csv
    - Survey1st_Puding_TownVillageLeaders.csv
    - Survey2nd_Puding_Farmers.csv
    - Survey2nd_Yujiang_CountyLeaders.csv
    - Survey2nd_Yujiang_Farmers.csv
  - Variables include detailed question-by-question codings (e.g., gender, age, training, sources of scientific information, policy involvement, farming practices, crop and water management, environmental issues) with both multiple-choice and open-text fields.
  - Data structure notes: many questions use coded response options (e.g., Q1 gender, Q2 age group), plus several free-text fields (e.g., Q5a, Q7a) for qualitative input.
  - Spatial/locational context: villages and landscapes identified (e.g., Chenqi, Houzhai, Mabao, Maguan, Jinhe, Liugu, Dayou), enabling potential geospatial linkage to catchments and landscape type.

- Detailed methodological notes
  - Data quality: inclusion of multiple landscapes and villages to enhance rigor and representativeness.
  - Data units: primarily social science survey data (quantitative codes and qualitative fields).
  - Calibration: not applicable (N/A).
  - Documentation: Tables describe column definitions and response coding; reference tables provide the mapping for each question's responses.

  - Related documentation indicates that interview data will be depository-ready in the future.

- GIS-relevant implications
  - The data include identifiers for villages and landscape types, enabling geospatial mapping of:
    - Stakeholder roles and policy influence across governance levels
    - Knowledge sources and training uptake
    - Farmer knowledge on soil erosion, soil management, water use, and environmental issues
    - Correlations between demographics, learning sources, and farming practices
  - Potential map-based products: stakeholder networks by village/landscape, spatial patterns of training and knowledge dissemination, and links between governance structures and policy implementation.
