# Supporting information for interpreting

## Overview
- Social surveys conducted 2016–2018 in Chinese rural villages to understand knowledge learning dynamics and preferences of local stakeholders.
- Studied two landscapes: karst (Puding) and red soil (Yujiang), across four governance levels (county leaders, town leaders, village leaders, and individual farmers).
- Questionnaires (closed and open-ended) were the primary method; interview data is to be deposited later.
- The project context is the China-UK Knowledge Exchange (KE) initiative; official contextual reports with DOIs are referenced.

## Data collection design
- Experimental design and sampling aimed to capture diverse perspectives across landscapes and governance levels.
- Fieldwork involved local undergraduates and villagers; the surveys targeted locations near scientific research and monitoring stations where village leaders were supportive.
- Questionnaire data were collected in two rounds (2016 and 2018) with different participant groups across two sites (Puding and Yujiang).
- Data processing and analysis included statistical tests to identify associations and differences at the 95% confidence level (p < 0.05), using Chi-square tests and 2-sample proportional tests (via Minitab).

## Datasets and structure
- The dataset comprises six CSV files:
  - Survey1st_Puding_CountyLeaders.csv
  - Survey1st_Puding_Farmers.csv
  - Survey1st_Puding_TownVillageLeaders.csv
  - Survey2nd_Puding_Farmers.csv
  - Survey2nd_Yujiang_CountyLeaders.csv
  - Survey2nd_Yujiang_Farmers.csv
- Content and encoding:
  - Each file contains structured responses to a common set of questions (Q1, Q2, Q3, etc.) with sections covering demographics, training, policy engagement, sources of scientific knowledge, and attitudes toward water/farm management.
  - Detailed column definitions and response codings are provided in accompanying data dictionaries (tables described in the text).
- Representative question areas include:
  - Demographics (gender, age, education/training)
  - Role and employer
  - Use of scientific knowledge in day-to-day work and sources (internet, journals, commissioned reports, collaboration with scientists)
  - Experiences with policy development, sharing/advising farmers, and monitoring policy outcomes
  - Engagement with scientists for understanding local landscapes (local landscape, water quality/quantity, erosion, pollution, etc.)
  - Attitudes toward training, co-production of policies/tools, and barriers to participation
- The 2016 set includes detailed surveys for Puding County Leaders, Puding Farmers, and Puding Town/Village Leaders (with sample sizes provided in the dataset summary). The 2018 set includes Survey2nd_Puding_Farmers, Survey2nd_Yujiang_CountyLeaders, and Survey2nd_Yujiang_Farmers.

## Data quality, metadata, and governance
- Quality control through surveying multiple landscapes and villages to improve rigor and representativeness.
- Metadata completeness is emphasized via explicit data dictionaries and per-file column definitions.
- Documentation notes that only questionnaire data are deposited at this stage; interview data will be deposited when ready.
- Contextual alignment with the KE project is indicated by cross-referenced official reports for Puding and Yujiang.

## Access and related materials
- Primary data: questionnaire responses from the six CSV files listed above.
- Related resources:
  - 2017 Report for the Puding Government (Zheng, Y. et al.) on the China-UK KE project
  - 2018 Report for the Yujiang Government (Zheng, Y. et al.) on the Red Soil KE project
- The dataset is intended to support analysis of knowledge exchange, data use by policymakers and farmers, and the integration of scientific information into local governance.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Shows a multi-tier data collection approach across governance levels and landscapes, useful for designing data ecosystems that support co-ownership and user-centered data products.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Mapping data availability and data gaps (granularity, standards, metadata) across stakeholders.
  - Ensuring data discoverability and discoverability of related reports and methodological detail.
  - Aligning data products with user needs through iterative feedback and cross-stakeholder collaboration (policy makers, farmers, scientists).
- Reveals opportunities to harmonize heterogeneous sources (farmers, leaders, scientists) and to coordinate across sectors to reduce data fragmentation.

## Limitations and caveats
- Data are restricted to questionnaire responses; interview data are not yet deposited.
- Variable sample sizes across sites and rounds (e.g., Yujiang County Leaders in 2018 n=3) may affect generalizability.
- Self-reported data and complex multi-part question structures require careful handling and harmonization for cross-dataset analyses.
- The depth of open-ended responses is not detailed here; interpretation relies on the accompanying data dictionaries.
