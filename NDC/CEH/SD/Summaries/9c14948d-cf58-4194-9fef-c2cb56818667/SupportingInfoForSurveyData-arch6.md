# Supporting information for interpreting

- The document describes social surveys conducted in 2016–2018 in Chinese rural villages (karst and red soil landscapes) to understand knowledge learning dynamics and preferences among four governance levels: county leaders, town/village leaders, and individual farmers.
- Data collection used questionnaires (main method) and interviews (not yet deposited); only questionnaire data are currently deposited.
- Two landscapes and multiple waves: Puding (karst) in 2016 and 2018; Yujiang (red soil) in 2018; surveyed groups include farmers and leaders with varying sample sizes.
- Data are intended to support interpretation of the broader China-UK Knowledge Exchange project and related policy/extension work.

## Survey Design and Scope

- Topics aim to capture how knowledge is learned, accessed, used, and shared; how scientists and government policies influence day-to-day farming decisions; and how policies are implemented and monitored.
- Participants:
  - 2016: Puding Karst – Farmers (312), County Leaders (15), Town/Village Leaders (32)
  - 2018 (Karst in Puding, and Red Soil in Yujiang): Farmers and leaders with smaller samples (e.g., 40 farmers in Puding; 117 farmers in Yujiang; 3 Yujiang County Leaders; others implied for leaders)
- Methodology:
  - Questionnaires with closed and open-ended questions; interviews planned for later depository.
  - Fieldwork supported by local undergraduates and villagers.
- Data structure: six CSV files corresponding to different respondent groups and waves (see Data Files section).

## Data Collected and Structure

- Collected data cover demographic attributes, training and education, sources of scientific information, policy knowledge and implementation, collaboration with scientists, and perceptions of environmental/farming issues.
- Data files (CSV) include:
  - Survey1st_Puding_CountyLeaders.csv
  - Survey1st_Puding_Farmers.csv
  - Survey1st_Puding_TownVillageLeaders.csv
  - Survey2nd_Puding_Farmers.csv
  - Survey2nd_Yujiang_CountyLeaders.csv
  - Survey2nd_Yujiang_Farmers.csv
- Content highlights by group:
  - Leaders: questions on roles, training, sources of scientific information, engagement with scientists, policy development, implementation processes, monitoring outcomes, regulation, and openness to incorporating new scientific findings.
  - Farmers (Puding and Yujiang): questions on demographics, farming history, family income, long-term importance of farming, major challenges, learning sources, government support, productivity improvements, types of crops and livestock, irrigation and water use, manure management, environmental awareness, barriers to participation in training, and interest in learning about soil and water management.
- Variable types include multiple-choice, Likert-like scales (e.g., level of helpfulness or interest), and open-text responses for additional context.

## Data Processing, Quality, and Analysis

- Analytical approaches:
  - Descriptive summaries of respondent groups and question categories.
  - Inferential statistics using Minitab: Chi-square tests for associations between sociodemographic characteristics and responses; 2-sample proportional tests where appropriate.
  - Significance threshold set at p < 0.05 for associations/differences.
- Quality control:
  - Sampling across multiple landscapes and villages to improve rigor and representativeness.
  - Data deposits currently focused on questionnaire data; interview data to be deposited later.
- Data units and scope:
  - Social science survey data across two waves and two landscapes, enabling cross-group and cross-landscape comparisons of knowledge access, training, policy uptake, and attitudes toward scientist-government collaboration.

## Data Files and Content Details

- Six CSV files contain the questionnaire data for different respondent groups and survey waves.
- Content themes across files include:
  - Demographics (gender, age, education, job role)
  - Learning and information sources (family, friends, fellow farmers, cooperatives, village/government, university, internet)
  - Training and government support (types of training, subsidies, prior government programs)
  - Interaction with scientists and higher-scale policymakers (co-production, advice, policy development)
  - Policy implementation and monitoring (which policies, how implemented, monitoring results)
  - Agricultural practices, environmental issues, water management, and soil/erosion knowledge (karst vs red soil context)
  - Barriers to participation in training or adopting new practices
- Landscape-specific emphasis:
  - Karst (Puding): knowledge exchange, soil/water management, policy implementation processes
  - Red soil (Yujiang): red soil erosion knowledge, soil management, government training and support
- Note: For brevity, each file comprises numerous questions (Q1, Q2, …) with detailed response options and some open-ended fields (e.g., Q5a, Q7a) to capture written inputs.

## Access, Documentation, and References

- Data are deposited as questionnaire data; interview data will be deposited as it becomes ready.
- Context and background reports referenced for broader interpretation:
  - Zheng et al. 2017: Report for the Puding Government on the China-UK Karst Knowledge Exchange project
  - Zheng et al. 2018: Report for the Yujiang Government on the China-UK Knowledge Exchange project for the Red Soil Critical Zone

## Data Use and Potential Products

- Potential data products for data-support practice:
  - Cross-tab dashboards comparing knowledge sources, training uptake, and policy engagement across leaders and farmers, by landscape and wave.
  - Pivot-table style summaries showing how access to scientific information correlates with policy understanding and implementation.
  - Visualizations of barriers to training participation and willingness to engage with scientists.
  - Longitudinal comparisons between waves to assess changes in knowledge exchange dynamics and policy uptake.
- Use cases relevant to the archetype:
  - Inform policy outreach and extension by identifying which knowledge sources (family, government, scientists) most strongly influence farmer practices and policy compliance.
  - Support data-driven communications by highlighting where simple, self-serve tools (dashboards, quick reference guides) could improve understanding among local leaders and farmers.
  - Plan collaborative activities with scientists and policymakers by pinpointing areas where co-production or decision-support tools would be most beneficial.
- Limitations to consider:
  - Data are questionnaire-based with potential non-response and self-report biases.
  - Interview data are not yet deposited, limiting qualitative depth from these waves.
  - Variable sample sizes differ by group and wave, affecting generalizability and cross-group comparisons.
