# Centre for Landscape and Climate Research Department of Geography Technical Report No. 8

## Overview
- Executive Summary of quality assessment for three CLC2012 UK datasets:
  - CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man)
  - CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Islands, Guernsey)
  - CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey)
- Purpose: assess internal and external quality control to ensure high-quality, harmonised CLC2012 data.

## Internal quality control
- All work units (WUs) underwent internal QC.
- Finished units were reviewed by an independent photo-interpretation expert (Geoff Smith) using InterCheck software with the same imagery/ancillary data as initial interpretation.
- Each WU was interpreted twice by two different people; feedback was provided as exported shapefiles and acted upon by interpreters.

## External quality control
- Two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) in 2013 and 2014 to ensure UK production meets European harmonisation standards.
- Verification covered 7 WUs (about 19% of UK coverage) and involved detailed visual checks of CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers using InterCheck.
- Outcomes categorized as Accepted (A), Conditionally Accepted (CA), or Rejected (R) with notes on necessary corrections.

## Key findings and common error types
- Typical issues identified in external verification included omissions and misclassifications:
  - Omitted small built-up areas and infrastructure (industries, airports, wind turbines).
  - Confusion between urban fabric (111) and Industry (121); misclassifications in mineral extraction (131), dumpsites (132), green urban areas (141), and sport/recreation (142).
  - Inaccuracies distinguishing arable (211) vs. pasture (231) and separating pasture (231) from natural grasslands (321).
  - Incomplete forest patches, imprecise forest boundaries, and mixed forests; boundary issues for moors/heathland (322) vs. natural grassland (321) and peatland (412).
  - Bare rocks (332) often misclassified as sparse vegetation (333); intertidal flats (423) and estuaries (522) needed revisiting.
- Other noted points:
  - Revisions sometimes used outdated 2006 layers; updates to CLC2006 revision and changes were essential.
  - Mapping of changes generally correct, but some changes were missed or couldn't be mapped due to imagery limits.
  - Importance of using the latest IMAGE2012 imagery and ensuring larger change areas (>5 ha) are separated from complex polygons.

## Implications for data governance and stewardship
- Emphasises rigorous, traceable quality assurance processes (internal and external) to achieve harmonised European datasets.
- Highlights need for ongoing collaboration between interpreters, quality controllers, and verification teams to maintain data integrity.
- Demonstrates the value of detailed feedback loops and documentation of errors for future dataset production.

## Data provenance and revision history
- Documentation included with verification reports (Büttner, 2013; 2014) outlining error types and corrective actions.
- All identified errors were addressed and corrected; two early WUs rejected were reinterpreted by a different interpreter using additional IMAGE2012 imagery.
- Remarks and general advice were applied to all subsequent WUs to ensure higher final data quality.

## Maintenance, updates, and sharing considerations
- Commissioning bodies (Defra and European Environment Agency) supported the project under the EU Copernicus programme, underscoring the need for standardized, updatable datasets.
- The external verification process reinforces the importance of maintaining harmonised data across European datasets and documenting revision histories for future updates.
