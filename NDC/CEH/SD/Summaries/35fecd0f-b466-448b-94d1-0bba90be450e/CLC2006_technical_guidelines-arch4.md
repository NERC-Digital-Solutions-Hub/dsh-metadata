# CLC2006 technical guidelines

- The document provides guidelines for updating Corine land cover data for 2006 (CLC2006) by integrating the 2000 base map (CLC2000) with land cover changes from 2000-2006 (CLC-Changes) using IMAGE2006 imagery.
- Production is led by EEA with National Reference Centres (NRCs) and ETC-LUSI, as part of the GMES Fast Track Service Precursor (FTSP) on Land Monitoring; 38 countries participate.

## Overview and context

- Aim: deliver a coherent European CLC2006 dataset and a European CLC-Changes database for 2000-2006.
- Data sources: IMAGE2006 multi-temporal satellite imagery (two dates) plus ancillary data; IMAGE2000 data used for baselines.
- Output structure: CLC2006 is generated by combining CLC2000 rev and CLC-Changes; CLC-Changes maps real land cover changes (>5 ha) between 2000 and 2006 with a 5 ha MMU (smaller than CLC2000/CLC2006 which have 25 ha MMU).
- Timeframe and governance reflect a shift toward timely, quality-assured, multi-country land monitoring.

## Key technical parameters

- Scale and mapping units: 1:100,000 scale; MMU for CLC mapping = 25 ha; minimum width of linear elements = 100 m.
- Classes: 44 land cover classes organized in a three-level hierarchy; five main groups: artificial surfaces, agricultural areas, forests and semi-natural areas, wetlands, and water bodies.
- Methodology: computer-assisted image interpretation; early CLC2000 improvements (geometry/thematic content) used as a basis; for CLC2006, emphasis on detecting real changes between 2000 and 2006.

## Data and methods

- Change-first updating approach: national teams interpret all changes larger than 5 ha directly from IMAGE2000 vs IMAGE2006, producing CLC-Changes and CLC2006 via integration with CLC2000 rev.
- Two databases involved:
  - CLC2000 rev: revised 2000 baseline (for accuracy and error correction).
  - CLC-Changes: database of real land cover changes between 2000 and 2006 (MMU 5 ha; minimum 100 m boundary displacement).
- CLC2006 production equation (conceptual): CLC2006 = CLC2000 rev + CLC-Changes (with adjustments for MMU differences). In practice, the integration is semi-automatic due to MMU differences; changes >25 ha can be integrated automatically, while smaller changes require generalisation.
- Change delineation: direct delineation of changes in a dual-window environment using IMAGE2000 and IMAGE2006; changes must correspond to real processes and be plotted against CLC2000 boundaries to avoid slivers.
- Change typology: eight types (A–H) based on presence/absence in source datasets and size thresholds; guidance provided for handling each type, including technical changes to address MMU gaps.
- Heterogeneous/landscape-level classes: for landscape-level mosaics (e.g., certain heterogeneous classes), changes may be mapped at landscape level when the overall character shifts significantly.

## Change mapping and data integration

- CLC-Changes as a separate, higher-resolution layer (MMU 5 ha) is used to capture all real changes >5 ha, including island-like changes.
- For CLC2006, changes >5 ha are delineated regardless of position; smaller changes may be consolidated or handled as technical changes (to avoid data gaps).
- Landscape-level changes in heterogeneous classes may either be mapped as specific changes (e.g., 324-211) or treated at landscape level (e.g., 243-211) when the landscape character changes substantially.
- Updated ancillary data (e.g., LUCAS, orthophotos) and ground-truth data are encouraged to support interpretation.
- The methodology emphasizes avoiding false changes and ensuring that the resulting CLC2006 map reflects real processes.

## Ancillary data and LUCAS

- Proposed ancillary data:
  - Topographic maps (minimum scale 1:50,000), digital if available.
  - Orthophotos and additional high-resolution imagery.
- LUCAS data (ground-truth/field data) support:
  - LUCAS 2001/2002: ground truth for improving CLC2000.
  - LUCAS 2006: aids in delineating land cover changes.
- LUCAS nomenclatures for land cover and land use are provided in annexes to support interpretation.

## Project organization and participation

- Structure: seven work packages (WP 1–WP 7) under GMES FTSP Land Monitoring; NRCs coordinate national activities; a Steering Committee and an LMCS Implementation Group provide governance and coordination.
- Roles: national teams (NRCs) implement national activities; ETC-LUSI supports integration, methodology, and quality assurance; JRC, ESA, and EC participate in governance and data procurement.

## Metadata and delivery

- Metadata: two levels required—working unit metadata (Annex 1) for CLC-Changes and country-level metadata (Annex 2) for each dataset (CLC-Changes, CLC2006, revised CLC2000 where applicable).
- Delivery formats:
  - Default: ESRI Arc/INFO Export Interchange File (E00) with no compression.
  - Optional: ESRI Personal Geodatabase (MDB).
- Naming conventions:
  - CHA06_xx.e00 for CLC changes (2000-2006)
  - CLC06_xx.e00 for CLC2006 status
  - CLC00_xx.e00 for revised CLC2000
  - Example: CHA06_MT02, CLC06_MT02, CLC00_MT02
- Coordinate reference system: national projections used for IMAGE2006; updates may require European CRS; cross-border border buffering (1 km) and coastal sea buffer (1 km) recommended for seamless integration.
- Delivery flow: data delivered to EEA via the Central Data Repository (CDR); technical quality checks (DBTA) performed by TT; iterative improvement process if major issues are found; notifications via Unified Notification Service.

## Verification and quality assurance

- Verification by the CLC Technical Team of ETC-LUSI for CLC2000 and CHA; two verification missions per country planned (2nd and 4th quarters).
- Tools: InterCheck software for automatic checks; topology checks and metadata validations.
- Quality criteria cover formal specifications, mapping, topology, and metadata; topological integrity, absence of gaps, and cross-layer consistency are required; metadata completeness and accuracy are checked.
- Previous CLC2000 experience informs 2006 QA processes to ensure Europe-wide harmonization.

## Deliverables and workflow

- Deliverables to be produced and submitted:
  - CHA06 (CLC-Changes 2000-2006)
  - CLC06 (CLC2006)
  - CLC00 (revised 2000, if applicable)
  - Working unit metadata (MWU_xx_nn)
  - Country metadata for CLC-Changes (MCOCH_xx)
  - Country metadata for CLC2006 (MCO06_xx)
- Delivery occurs through the EEA Central Data Repository; envelopes must be prepared and versioned; validation and acceptance are performed by the Technical Team; multiple iterations may occur to achieve acceptance.
- Final objective: ready-for-integration data with clear documentation and metadata, enabling European-scale harmonized analyses.
