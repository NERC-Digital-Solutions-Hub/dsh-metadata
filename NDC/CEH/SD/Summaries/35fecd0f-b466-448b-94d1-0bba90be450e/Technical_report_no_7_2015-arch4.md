- Dataset characteristics and attributes
  - Attribute table includes CLC classification codes for level 3, area in hectares, length and area of the shapefile features, plus remarks and IDs.
  - Metadata language: English; compliance notes reference INSPIRE/EEA metadata guidelines.

- Abstract and purpose of CLC data
  - CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2012 and 2006-2012 changes provide consistent land cover information across Europe.
  - Used for environmental monitoring, indicators, policy support, and EU directives (e.g., biodiversity, climate change impacts, Water Framework Directive).
  - Based on satellite imagery (2011–2013) and supporting aerial imagery (Google Earth); aims to map changes above 5 ha with a 25 ha MMU for status layers and 5 ha MMU for change layers.
  - National maps updated to 2012 reference year; 2007 LCM was the closest prior update.

- Metadata standards and online resources
  - Metadata compliant with the EEA Metadata Profile and INSPIRE (with some extended elements).
  - Online resource and guidelines available; metadata and dataset references located on Copernicus/EEA portals.
  - File identifier: CLC_metadata_UK; Metadata language: eng; Character set: UTF-8.

- Governance, access, and licensing
  - Data access governed by EU licensing regimes and GMES/Copernicus regulations (regulatory references and conditions included).
  - Free, full, and open access under specified conditions:
    - Users must acknowledge the data source.
    - Users should not imply official Union endorsement.
    - Any adaptations or modifications must be clearly stated.
  - Documentation notes that licensing conditions apply, with ongoing regulatory context transitioning from Regulation (EU) No 911/2010 to subsequent regulations.

- Provenance, lineage, and methodology
  - Update objective: detect/identify/map land cover changes above 5 ha for 2012 reference year.
  - Lineage: reliance on satellite imagery (2011–2013) with Google Earth imagery supporting interpretation.
  - Acknowledges the lack of an up-to-date national land cover map at the 2012 update; references to prior LCM2007 status.
  - Adherence to EEA technical guidelines and use of InterChange for mapping CLC changes.

- Extent and scale
  - Geographic bounding box and extent cover the UK (including NI and Isle of Man) and the Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey).
  - Spatial resolution details included (Denominator 100000).

- Contact, authorship, and acknowledgments
  - Metadata authored by the University of Leicester (Originator) with custodianship by Defra; supported by the European Environment Agency and EC DG-ENTR.
  - Acknowledgments note the contribution of Specto Natura and funding under EU Copernicus/GMES program.

- Key takeaways for data leadership
  - Clear, versioned data assets with well-defined spatial frameworks and attributes support broad reuse and governance.
  - Metadata aligns with INSPIRE/EEA standards to enable discoverability and interoperability.
  - Licensing and access constraints are explicit, balancing open access with regulatory compliance.
  - Provenance and lineage documentation enable traceability of data sources and methods, essential for policy-facing analytics and reporting.
