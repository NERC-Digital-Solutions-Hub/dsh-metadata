# Executive Summary

- Datasets evaluated: (i) CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK including Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man), (ii) CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Islands: Guernsey and Jersey), (iii) CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey). These support harmonised European CLC2012 mapping.

- Internal quality control (QC):
  - All Work Units (WUs) underwent internal QC.
  - Finished units were reviewed by an independent photo-interpreter (Geoff Smith) using InterCheck software and the same imagery/ancillary data.
  - Each WU was interpreted twice by two different interpreters; feedback was provided as exported shapefiles and acted upon before finalisation.

- External quality control (QC):
  - Two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) occurred in July 2013 and September 2014 to ensure UK production met European standards.
  - Seven WUs were externally checked, representing about 19% of the UK coverage.
  - External verification used similar methods (InterCheck) with verification reports and error shapefiles attached to feedback.

- Typical external verification findings:
  - Common errors identified across layers (e.g., CLC2006 revision and subsequent changes) included omissions of small built-up areas, omissions of infrastructure (industries, airports, wind turbines), confusion between urban fabric and industry, inaccuracies in mineral extraction/dumpsites, issues with green urban areas and sport/recreation classes, misclassification between arable and pasture, mis-separation of pasture and natural grasslands, incomplete forest boundaries, and mistargeted boundaries for moors/heathlands and peatlands.
  - Some forest patches, boundaries, and vegetation classifications required refinement; intertidal flats and estuaries needed revisiting.
  - For changes, challenges included ensuring use of the latest IMAGE2012 imagery and separating more than 5 ha of change from complex polygons.

- Change and revision outcomes:
  - All identified errors were addressed and corrected.
  - Two WUs that were initially rejected were re-interpreted by a different interpreter using additional IMAGE2012 imagery.
  - Feedback and best-practice remarks were applied to subsequent WUs to ensure high-quality final data.

- Key lessons and recommendations:
  - Maintain high-quality, up-to-date imagery (IMAGE2012) for accurate change mapping.
  - Clearly separate changes greater than 5 hectares within complex polygons.
  - Revisit and revise inherited issues from the CLC2006 layer to sustain consistency and accuracy.
