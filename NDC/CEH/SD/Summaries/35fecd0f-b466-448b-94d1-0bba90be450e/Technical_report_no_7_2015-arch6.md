# Technical Report No. 7

## Overview
- Metadata and description of Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2012 datasets for the UK, Guernsey, and Jersey, including changes from 2006 to 2012.
- Datasets provide geographic land cover classifications, change detection, and revised 2006 maps to support consistent European land cover inventories.
- Produced under the Copernicus GMES framework, with international collaboration and support from Defra and the European Environment Agency (EEA).

## Metadata and scheme
- Copernicus land cover metadata (CLC) 2012; reflects updates for reference year 2012 and change detection (2006-2012).
- 44-class Corine nomenclature; minimum mapping unit (MMU) 25 ha for status, 100 m for linear elements; change MMU 5 ha.
- Documentation emphasizes INSPIRE-compliant metadata and alignment with EU metadata guidelines.
- Spatial extent: roughly covering UK, Guernsey, and Jersey with geographic bounding box West -8.62 to East 1.76; South 49.88 to North 60.84.
- Spatial resolution: 1:100,000 scale (denominator 100000).

## Production and lineage
- Created using satellite imagery from 2011–2013; supported by aerial imagery (Google Earth).
- UK LCM2007 served as the last up-to-date national map prior to 2012 update.
- Followed EEA technical guidelines; used InterChange for CLC mapping and revision of the 2006 map.
- Represents a European-wide effort to produce a seamless land cover inventory for environmental monitoring and policy support.

## Data products and intended use
- Primary products:
  - CLC2012 (land cover for 2012)
  - CLC2006revised (revised 2006 map)
  - CLC-Changes (2006-2012)
- Use cases: environmental monitoring, formulation of environmental indicators, tracking climate change impacts, and supporting EU policy areas (e.g., biodiversity, water framework, agriculture).
- Outputs designed for self-service analysis (e.g., alongside other datasets) and for integration into policy and planning workflows.

## Access, licensing, and usage constraints
- Use limitation: governed by EU Regulation 1159/13; subsequent changes apply under Regulation 377/2014.
- Open access is provided under conditions:
  - Acknowledge source when distributing or publishing data.
  - Do not imply EU endorsement of user activities.
  - Clearly state any adaptations or modifications.
- Data ownership remains with the EU for Copernicus data/service information produced, under grant agreements.
