# Technical Report No. 8

## Overview
- Report on internal and external quality assessment measures for three datasets: CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man), CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Isles and Guernsey), and CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey).
- Emphasizes rigorous QA processes to ensure harmonised European CLC2012 data.

## Internal quality control
- Work units (WUs) underwent internal QA before finalising.
- An independent photo-interpreter (Geoff Smith) rechecked each WU using the InterCheck software with the same imagery and ancillary data.
- Each WU was interpreted twice by two different interpreters; feedback was exported as shapefiles and incorporated.

## External quality control
- Two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) in July 2013 and September 2014 to ensure UK production met harmonisation standards.
- External checks covered CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers using InterCheck; errors were recorded as points with attributes and fed back to interpreters.
- External verification involved 7 WUs, representing 19% of UK coverage, with varying verification missions and interpreters.

## External verification results
- Results highlighted the importance of revisiting the CLC2006 layer due to prior inaccuracies.
- Typical error types identified in CLC2006 included:
  - Omissions of discontinuous built-up areas and infrastructure (e.g., industries, airports, wind turbines).
  - Inaccuracies distinguishing urban fabric (111) from Industry (121), and other land-cover classes (e.g., 131/132; 141/142; 211/231; 231/321; 322/321; 332/333).
  - Incompletely mapped forest patches and imprecise boundaries.
  - Boundaries for moors/heathland vs. natural grasslands and peatland.
  - Issues with intertidal flats (423) and estuaries (522).
- Notes on mapping changes: using latest IMAGE2012 imagery; ensuring change areas greater than 5ha are separated from complex change polygons.
- Full details available in verification reports (Büttner 2013; 2014).

## Change and data handling observations
- Change mapping was generally correct but included a few missed changes, partly due to limited imagery at the time of interpretation.
- Two WUs were rejected and re-interpreted by different interpreters using additional IMAGE2012 data.
- Lessons and general advice from verification were applied to all subsequent WUs to improve final data quality.

## Conclusions
- External verifications underscored significant areas for revision in the historically inherited CLC2006 layer.
- The QA process (internal double-interpretation, feedback loops, and external verification) aimed to produce high-quality, harmonised CLC2012 UK data.
