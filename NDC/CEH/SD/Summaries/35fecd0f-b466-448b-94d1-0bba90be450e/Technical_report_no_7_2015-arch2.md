Copernicus land CORINE metadata 2012

## Overview
- Metadata for Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2012 and CLC change 2006-2012 for UK, Guernsey, and Jersey.
- Datasets and structure:
  - Dataset 1: Corine land cover 2006 (revised), 2012 and changes (2006-2012) for the UK
  - Dataset 2: Corine land cover 2006 (revised), 2012 and changes (2006-2012) for Guernsey
  - Dataset 3: Corine land cover 2006 (revised), 2012 and changes (2006-2012) for Jersey
- Each dataset contains three layers:
  - CLC-Changes (2006-2012)
  - CLC2006revised
  - CLC2012
- Purpose: provide consistent land cover information and change detection to support environmental monitoring and policy.

## Geographic and technical details
- Geographic extent (bounding box)
  - West: -8.62, East: 1.76
  - South: 49.88, North: 60.84
- Spatial resolution: 1:100,000 denominator
- Lineage and methodology
  - Update to reference year 2012; detection of land cover changes above 5 ha
  - Source imagery: satellites 2011-2013; supporting aerial imagery from Google Earth
  - Prior national map: LCM2007 (closest to CLC2006 status); no up-to-date national map available for this update
  - Followed EEA technical guidelines; used InterChange for mapping CLC changes
- Access and use constraints
  - Access governed by EU Regulation 1159/2013 (and related regulatory context)
  - In practice: free, full, and open access with conditions:
    - Acknowledge data source
    - Do not imply EU endorsement of user activities
    - Clearly state any adaptations or modifications
  - Data remains EU property; rights consistent with grant terms
- Lineage details (further)
  - Copernicus/GMES metadata context; reference to 44 CLC classes; MMU = 25 ha for status layers; MMU for change layers = 5 ha; minimum mapping unit details

## Date and acknowledgment
- Metadata date stamp: 2015-01-09
- Acknowledgment of contributors and funding sources for the Copernicus/EEA UK CLC metadata project

## Relevance for environmental analysts
- Provides standardized, INSPIRE-compliant metadata for UK and crown dependencies’ land cover data and change layers
- Enables data provenance, quality assurance, and interoperability for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time
- Supports integration with other environmental datasets and indicators (e.g., biodiversity, climate change impacts, water directives) through standardized parameters, MMU rules, and documented lineage.
