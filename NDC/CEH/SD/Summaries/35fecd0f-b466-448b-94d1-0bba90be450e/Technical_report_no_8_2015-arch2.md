# Technical Report No. 8

- Overview: This report documents internal and external quality assessment measures applied to the CLC2012 UK datasets (CLC2012_UK.mdb for the UK including Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man; CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb for Channel Islands; CLC2012_UK_JE for Jersey). The aim is to support harmonised European CLC2012 data through rigorous quality control and verification.

- Internal quality control
  - All Working Units (WUs) underwent internal QC.
  - Finished units were sent to an independent photo-interpreter (Geoff Smith) to re-check using the same imagery and ancillary data.
  - InterCheck software was used; results exported as shapefiles and fed back to interpreters.
  - Each WU was interpreted twice by two different people to ensure consistency.

- External quality control
  - Two remote verifications were conducted by the European Technical Team (CTT) in July 2013 and September 2014 to assess UK production against harmonised European standards.
  - Seven WUs were externally checked, representing about 19% of UK coverage, focusing on CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers.
  - Verification involved detailed visual checks using InterCheck; results were recorded as points with descriptive attributes and fed back to the interpretation team.

- Key findings and issues
  - External verification used a process similar to internal QC and categorized results as Accepted (A), Conditioned Accepted (CA), or Rejected (R); several units required revisions.
  - Typical issues in the CLC2006 layer included:
    - Omissions of discontinuous built-up areas, including smaller built-up zones.
    - Missed infrastructure elements (industries, airports, wind turbines).
    - Confusion between continuous urban fabric (111) and Industry (121).
    - Inaccuracies in mineral extraction (131) and dumpsites (132).
    - Inaccuracies in green urban areas (141) and sport/recreation (142).
    - Difficulties separating arable (211) from pasture (231) and pasture (231) from natural grasslands (321).
    - Missing forest patches; imprecise forest boundaries; misclassification of mixed forests.
    - Unclear boundaries for moors/heathland (322) versus natural grassland (321) and peatland (412).
    - Bare rocks (332) often misclassified as sparse vegetation (333).
    - Intertidal flats (423) and estuaries (522) needing revisiting.
  - For changes, while mappings were generally correct, some missed changes occurred due to limited satellite imagery; greater than 5 ha change needed to be separated out from complex change polygons.
  - Two WUs were initially rejected; they were re-interpreted by a different interpreter using additional IMAGE 2012 imagery. Feedback was applied to all subsequent units to ensure higher quality.
  - Overall, the verification highlighted ongoing need for thorough revision of the CLC2006 layer to improve accuracy in subsequent outputs.

- Recommendations and outcomes
  - All identified errors were addressed and corrected; general remarks and advice were incorporated into later work to improve data quality.
  - The exercise reinforced the importance of using the latest imagery (IMAGE 2012) for accurate change mapping and ensuring clear separation of large and complex changes.
  - Emphasis on maintaining high-quality, harmonised outputs suitable for European-wide use.
