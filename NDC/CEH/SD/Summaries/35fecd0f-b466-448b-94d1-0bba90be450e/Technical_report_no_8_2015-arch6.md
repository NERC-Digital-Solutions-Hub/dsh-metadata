# Technical Report No. 8

## Overview
- Datasets assessed: (i) CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man), (ii) CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Islands: Guernsey and Alderney), (iii) CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey).
- Purpose: Apply internal and external quality assessment to ensure harmonised European CLC2012 outputs for the UK and Crown dependencies.
- Process: All work units (WUs) underwent internal quality control and were reviewed by an independent photo-interpreter (Geoff Smith) using InterCheck software with the same imagery and ancillary data; each WU interpreted twice by two different people.

## Internal quality control
- Independent review: Completed WUs were checked by a second interpreter.
- Feedback loop: Comments delivered as exported shapefiles and incorporated before finalisation.
- Outcome: Ensured high reliability through dual interpretation for all WUs.

## External quality control results
- External verifications: Two remote verifications (July 2013 and September 2014) conducted by the European Technical Team (CTT) to verify UK production against harmonised European CLC2012 standards.
- Scope: Seven WUs were externally checked (3 in 2013, 4 in 2014), representing 19% of UK coverage; representing early and later project work across interpreters.
- Method: Used InterCheck software for detailed visual checks of CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers; errors logged as points with descriptive attributes and fed back with verification reports.
- Verification outcomes: Results categorized as A (Accepted), CA (Conditionally accepted), or R (Rejected) for each WU.
- Key finding: External verification underscored the importance of revising the CLC2006 layer due to prior inaccuracies.

## Typical problems identified (technical issues)
- Omissions in discontinuous built-up areas, especially smaller settlements.
- Omissions of infrastructure elements (industries, airports, wind turbines).
- Difficulties distinguishing between continuous urban fabric (111) and Industry (121).
- Inaccuracies in mineral extraction (131) and dumpsites (132).
- Inaccuracies in green urban areas (141) and sport/recreation (142).
- Confusion between arable land (211) and pasture (231).
- Confusion between pasture (231) and natural grasslands (321).
- Missing forest patches and imprecise forest boundaries; challenges in separating mixed forest.
- Unclear boundaries for moors/heathland (322) vs natural grassland (321) and peatland (412).
- Bare rocks (332) often misclassified as sparse vegetation (333).
- Intertidal flats (423) and estuaries (522 requiring revisits).

## Change mapping considerations
- Use the latest IMAGE2012 imagery to ensure accurate change mapping.
- Ensure that changes greater than 5 hectares are separated out from complex polygons.
- Full details and context are available in the verification reports (Büttner, 2013; 2014).

## Process outcomes and improvements
- All identified errors were addressed and corrected.
- WU(s) rejected in external verification were reinterpreted by a different interpreter using additional IMAGE 2012 imagery.
- Feedback and remarks from verification were applied to all subsequent WUs to improve final data quality.
