# Copernicus land CORINE metadata 2012

- This document presents metadata for Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2012 data and the 2006-2012 changes for the UK, Guernsey, and Jersey, produced under the Copernicus (GMES) programme.
- Data consist of three layers per region: CLC-Changes (2006-2012), CLC2006revised, and CLC2012.
- The metadata follows INSPIRE guidelines with European Commission and EEA involvement, and includes licensing and usage information.

## Metadata and standards

- Metadata language: English (eng)
- Compliance: Metadata compliant with the EEA Metadata Profile (INSPIRE compliant metadata with some extended elements)
- Online resource: Link to Copernicus/CLC metadata portal
- Point of contact: University of Leicester (Originator), Defra (Custodian), European Environment Agency (Owner/Contact)

## Extent and resolution

- Geographic extent: West -8.62, East 1.76, South 49.88, North 60.84
- Spatial resolution: 1:100,000 scale (Denominator 100000)

## Lineage and methodology

- Timeframe: CLC 2012 update and 2006-2012 change detection
- Data sources: Satellite imagery from 2011-2013; aerial imagery (Google Earth) to support interpretation
- Methodology: European EEA guidelines; InterChange tool for mapping CLC changes
- Notes: Unlike earlier versions, no up-to-date national land cover map existed for the UK at update; last national map update prior to 2012 was LCM2007
- Change detection: Focused on changes above 5 hectares for the CLC change layer

## Qualifications, constraints, and usage

- Minimum mapping unit and classes: 44 CLC classes; MMU for status layers is 25 hectares; MMU for land cover changes is 5 hectares
- Purpose: Provides consistent land cover and change information to support environmental monitoring, policy indicators, and EU reporting
- Access and licensing: Free, full, and open access with conditions per Regulation EU 1159/13 (and transitional amendments). Users must acknowledge data source, avoid implying Union endorsement, and clearly state if data are modified
- Acknowledgments: Funded and produced by University of Leicester, Defra, and EEA under the Copernicus programme
