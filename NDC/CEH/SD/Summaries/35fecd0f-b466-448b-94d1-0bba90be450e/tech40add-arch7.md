# CORINE land cover technical guide - Addendum 2000

- Purpose and scope
  - Addendum to the CORINE Land Cover Technical Guide (1994) to support land cover monitoring.
  - Provides additional methodological information, softcopy interpretation guidance, (semi-) automated conversion approaches, and extended nomenclature/descriptions for 1:100,000 mapping.
  - Extends guidance for Central/Eastern Europe extensions and generalisation rules; clarifies landscape content interpretation.

- Key aims for GIS-focused data production
  - Help data collectors update CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data with new information not in the 1994 guide.
  - Describe methodological developments using softcopy tools (on-screen interpretation) and automated/pixel-to-nomenclature conversions.
  - Improve understanding of CLC classes and landscape patterns; extend the nomenclature for scale-appropriate mapping.
  - Provide generalisation rules and class descriptions to support mapping at 1:100,000.

- Part I: State-of-play and production methods
  - Hardcopy inventory
    - Original CORINE approach used computer-assisted photo-interpretation on 1:100,000 satellite image prints with transparency overlays and ancillary data.
    - Emphasises homogeneous features, significance at mapping scale, and clear delineation from neighbours.
  - Softcopy inventory
    - Advances to interpreting and digitising in a single pass using on-screen GIS environments.
    - Emphasises integrated GIS capabilities, raster and vector data handling, and flexible data visualization.
  - GIS considerations and Co-pilot software
    - Integrated GIS systems should support multiple data sets, various raster/vector formats (including geoTIFF, DXF), and cross-window linking.
    - Co-pilot (JRC) provides an integrated, Windows-based GIS for CORINE data with data modeled as geographic objects (points, lines, surfaces) and an ASCII-based configuration (Catalogue, Typelook, GraphicSet).
  - Data types in the workflow
    - Text, images, and icons linked to geographic objects; editable textual attributes; image/document attachments.
  - System customization and functionalities
    - Emphasis on modular, standards-aligned development (interfaces, development kits, portability).
    - Minimal essential functionalities:
      - Basic: display/edit geometry, attributes, relations
      - Image: import/export, overlay raster/vector, image enhancement
      - Queries: geographic/arithmetic/Boolean queries
      - Database management and indexing
      - Import/export with other platforms
      - Georeferencing and metadata/documentation
  - Co-pilot software
    - Manages data "at continuum" across time; emphasizes geographic objects and a catalog-driven schema.
    - Available for national CLC teams; supports consistent data maintenance.

- 4. Conversion of (semi-)automated classifications
  - Limitations of automated conversion
    - Image quality variability, ground-truth differences between land cover and land use, and the holistic human interpretation required for CORINE.
    - Pixel-based classifications vs. object-based, qualitative interpretation challenges.
  - Generalisation and spatial processes
    - Spatial generalisation reduces data complexity but increases abstraction errors; three broad approaches:
      - Reclassification (nesting within the class hierarchy)
      - Aggregation (merging nearby features)
      - Amalgamation (joining/merging or splitting features; attribute vs. spatial amalgamation)
      - Smoothing and simplification of boundaries
  - Conversion quality issues
    - Distinct data models: polygon (homogeneous areas) vs raster (dominant class per cell).
    - Key error sources: spectral confusion, mixed pixels, system errors, conceptual mapping errors.
  - Statistical properties and generalisation quality
    - Phase-space concepts for discrete land cover classes.
    - Traditional quality metrics are often insufficient for generalisation; need overlay comparisons and visual checks.
  - Practical takeaway for GIS work
    - Automated conversion can aid but requires careful human interpretation, especially for hierarchical class definitions and spatial patterning.

- 5. Validation methodology
  - Purpose: assess reliability of CORINE inventory relative to methodology, not to test data models.
  - Random sampling validation
    - Re-interpretation of national areas using random sampling; produces confusion matrices to quantify omissions/commissions per class.
    - Enables reliability estimates at different nomenclature levels and strata.
  - Sampling methodology (overview)
    - Stratified random sampling by land cover item and/or geographical region.
    - Determine number of sampling points per stratum to balance precision and practicality.
  - Determination of sampling points
    - Points distributed proportionally to area; step-size-based systematic selection of units; points allocated within units using local random methods.
    - Handling cases with multiple points per unit via grid subdivision and random point placement.
  - Interpretation, validation, and raising
    - On-screen interpretation at scales not exceeding ~1:40,000 during validation.
    - Validation circles (1 km radius) used to assess the land cover within each unit, with interpretation based on CORINE methodology.
    - Creation of confusion matrices and estimation of correctly classified area per stratum and overall.
    - Aggregation of results across strata and nomenclature levels with standard error estimates.
  - Statistical treatment
    - Formulas for estimating errors and variances across strata and aggregated levels.
    - Emphasis on area-proportional sampling and stratified error propagation.

- Part II: Addendum to the CORINE land cover nomenclature illustrated guide
  - Introduction and purpose
    - Refines and extends the 1994 class definitions without changing core content.
    - Provides more precise descriptions, included/excluded cases, representative textures/patterns, and example photographs.
    - Aims to reduce confusions and support image interpretation at 1:100,000.
  - Methodology
    - Visual interpretation grounded in landscape-object relationships and image interpretation elements (texture, pattern).
  - Content structure
    - For each class, includes:
      - Refined or extended definitions
      - Dominant landscape objects and typical arrangements
      - Texture and pattern descriptions
      - Representative photographs
      - Class particularities and examples
  - Key class themes and generalisation guidance
    - Urban fabric emphasis (e.g., Classes 111, 112, 121, 122, 123, 124)
    - Agricultural classes (2.x) with specific notes on abandoned land, irrigation, vineyards, and mixed patterns
    - Forest and natural vegetation classes (3.x) with detailed texture patterns and canopy considerations
    - Wetlands and water bodies (4.x, 5.x) with delineation rules and macro-patterns
  - Examples of class content
    - Urban fabric patterns, continuous vs discontinuous density thresholds (e.g., 111, 112)
    - Specifics for roads/rail networks, water bodies, port areas (e.g., 122, 123)
    - Agricultural land subdivisions (211–243) including abandoned, irrigated, vineyards, complex cultivation patterns
    - Forest classes (311–324) with canopy, texture, and delineation rules
    - Inland/coastal wetlands and water classifications (411–523)

- Practical implications for GIS specialists
  - Data production workflows: can combine hardcopy photo-interpretation with softcopy, GIS-based interpretation, and semi-automated classification while applying expert human interpretation.
  - Data models and formats: support for polygon-based CORINE units and raster-to-vector conversions; interoperability via geoTIFF and vector formats; Co-pilot-style configuration enables consistent data management.
  - Quality and validation: rigorous stratified random validation framework provides quantified accuracy metrics and confidence intervals at multiple nomenclature levels.
  - Nomenclature and generalisation: Part II provides refined criteria to improve classification accuracy and consistency across Europe, including urban/rural continuums and landscape pattern interpretations.

- References and context
  - Core references include the 1994 CORINE Land Cover Technical Guide and subsequent methodological/quality references from European and national bodies.

- Note
  - The addendum emphasizes that while automated conversions and softcopy methods offer efficiency, human interpretation remains essential due to the complexity and contextual nature of land cover classes.
