- Guidelines: Follows EEA metadata guidelines; INSPIRE-compliant metadata with extensions
- Coverage and scale: UK, with broader European integration; 100,000:1 denominator spatial resolution mentioned
- Language and encoding: Metadata language eng; character set UTF-8

## Access, licensing, and usage

- Access conditions: Data use governed by Commission delegated regulation (EU) No 1159/13; free, full, and open access under Copernicus terms with stated conditions
