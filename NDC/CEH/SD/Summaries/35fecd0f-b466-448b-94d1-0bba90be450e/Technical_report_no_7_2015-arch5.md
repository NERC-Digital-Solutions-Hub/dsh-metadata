# Copernicus land CORINE metadata 2012

## Overview
- Metadata accompanying three CORINE land cover datasets for the UK and Channel Islands (i.e., CLC2012_UK.mdb for the UK including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man; CLC2012_UK.mdb for Guernsey; and CLC2012_UK.mdb for Jersey).
- Datasets comprise three layers each: CLC-Changes (2006-2012), CLC2006revised, and CLC2012.
- Purpose: document metadata in support of Copernicus Land Monitoring (CLC) within the GMES framework; metadata aligned with INSPIRE/EEA guidelines.

## Metadata framework and access
- Metadata language: eng
- Hierarchy level: Dataset
- Metadata compliance: Metadata compliant with the EEA Metadata Profile (INSPIRE compliant metadata with some extended elements)
- Online resource: Linkage available (http://cdr.eionet.europa.eu/gb/eea/clc/envvlpnwa/)
- Metadata authority and contact
  - Point of contact: University of Leicester (Originator), Defra (Custodian), European Environment Agency (Owner), European Commission - DG ENTR (Owner)

- Extent: Geographic bounding box
  - West -8.62, East 1.76, South 49.88, North 60.84
- Spatial resolution: Denominator 100000 (scale context)

## Data production, lineage and purpose
- Lineage: CLC UK dataset updated for reference year 2012; objective to detect/mapping land cover changes >5 ha.
- Data sources: Satellite imagery from 2011-2013; aerial imagery from Google Earth supported interpretation.
- Methodology context: Unlike prior UK updates, no up-to-date national land cover map was available; used EEA technical guidelines and InterChange for mapping CLC changes; revised 2006 map used as a reference point.
- Purpose: supports land cover change monitoring, environmental indicators, and policy reporting (EU priorities such as ecosystem protection, biodiversity, climate change tracking, agriculture, Water Framework Directive).

## Access, licensing and usage constraints
- Resource constraint and usage: Access governed by Commission delegated regulation (EU) No 1159/13 (supplementing Regulation No 911/2010) with licensing conditions for GMES data.
- Open access: Free, full, and open access to data under conditions
  - Users must acknowledge the source of data
  - Users must not imply EU endorsement of their activities
  - If data are adapted or modified, must clearly state this
  - EU ownership considerations apply to information and data produced under Copernicus actions
- Note: Regulation No 911/2010 repealed by Regulation No 377/2014; transitional provisions apply per Article 33(2)

## Temporal context and updates
- Date stamp: 2015-01-09
- Abstract/Context: Related to Copernicus Land - CORINE land cover UK 2012; notes the 2012 update and the long-running CORINE time series since 1990 with updates in 2000, 2006, and 2012
- Data period: 2012 reference year; imagery from 2011-2013; earlier LCM update from 2007

## Acknowledgments
- Project carried out by University of Leicester (Centre for Landscape and Climate Research) with Specto Natura; supported by Defra and the European Environment Agency (EEA) under EU grant; funding via the EU Copernicus Programme

## Practical notes for Data Stewards
- Ensure dataset-level governance: three-layer structure per country, with explicit coordinate reference systems and datums for each geography
- Verify metadata compliance: INSPIRE/EEA metadata standards and extended elements are present
- Manage access and attribution: comply with EU GMES licensing conditions; provide source attribution and note any adaptations
- Track lineage and provenance: document data sources (satellite imagery window and aerial support) and processing steps (CLC changes mapping, 2006 revision, 2012 update)
- Monitor constraints: be aware of embargoes or proprietary issues and the implications for timely data delivery
- Maintain contact and provenance records: reference originator, custodian, owner organizations and the relevant governance chain for updates and inquiries
