# Impacts of experimental drought and plant trait diversity on floral resources and pollinator visitation

## Overview
- Investigates how plant functional diversity and experimental drought affect floral resources and pollinator visitation.
- Includes measures of nectar production, flower abundance/diversity, nectar quality, pollinator visits, and soil moisture.
- Data derived from the Winklebury Hill field experiment (2013–2016) with seed and plug-plant introductions and drought manipulation.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Location and timeframe
  - Wiltshire, UK (Winklebury Hill); field work conducted 2013–2016.
- Plant functional groups (FG) and community structure
  - FG1: deep tap roots, large leaves; hypothesized low nutrient cycling, poor drought resistance.
  - FG2: long-lived, shallow roots; hypothesized low nutrient cycling but better drought resistance.
  - FG3: long-lived, shallow fibrous roots; hypothesized high nutrient cycling and good drought resistance.
  - Seven plant-community combinations across plots; replicated in six blocks.
- Plot layout
  - 8 m x 8 m plots, 2 m gaps between plots.
  - Each plot contains three subplots with different treatments; subplots arranged to control for spatial effects.
  - Overall grid across six rows with replicated treatment combinations.
- Treatments and drought design
  - Drought (D): rain excluded with transparent shelters for six weeks.
  - Control (C): ambient rainfall.
  - Roofed control (R): transparent roof with small holes to control for roof effects (temperature/light).
  - Drought period: initiated in 2015 and 2016 for two successive years; shelters in place during late spring to mid-summer.
  - Soil moisture content (SMC) assessed at the end of the drought period, showing lower moisture under drought treatment.

## Data collected and measures
- Floral resources
  - Metrics: number of flowers, flower diversity, proportion of flowers with nectar, nectar amount and quality.
  - Focused species: Lathyrus pratensis (FG2), Onobrychis viciifolia (FG3), Prunella vulgaris (FG2); FG1 species used mainly for community-scale studies.
  - Sampling: racemes were bagged for 24 hours; nectar volume measured with microcapillaries; nectar sugar concentration measured with a refractometer; nectar mass per flower calculated from volume and concentration.
- Nectar pooling and calculations
  - When readings were insufficient, nectar from multiple flowers on the same raceme was pooled.
  - Conversions applied to estimate nectar concentration in consistent units.
- Community scale and pollinator visitation
  - Floral surveys in 1 m² quadrats within subplots; species identified; floral units counted.
  - Pollinator surveys: 10-minute observations per quadrat; recorded visitor identity (morphotype when needed), plant species visited, and floral unit visits.
  - Two survey rounds conducted on different days; weather conditions adhered to standard protocols.
- Additional measures
  - Soil moisture content measured post-drought.
- Datasets and linking
  - Files: NERCPropNectar.csv, NERCNectar.csv, NERCFloralSurveys.csv, NERCPollinatorSurveys.csv.
  - Linking fields: PlotID, RacemeID, SubplotID, SurveyID enable cross-dataset connections and linkage to Fry et al. datasets.

## Data quality, metadata, and ethics
- Data handling and QA
  - Adherence to set field protocols; data entered in MS Access with anomaly checks.
  - Missing data acknowledged and detailed in per-file metadata.
  - Metadata includes detailed variable descriptions, units, and categorical/character data handling notes.
- Ethics and governance
  - Ethics approval obtained from University of Exeter (CLES Penryn Research Ethics Committee).
  - Data are archived with linking keys to ensure traceability and reuse.
  - Data hosted in the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre; datasets referenced in associated publications.

## Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
- What is measured
  - Environmental health indicators include floral resource availability, nectar production/quality, pollinator visitation rates, and drought-induced soil moisture changes.
- Data governance considerations
  - Demonstrates the value of well-documented metadata, data linking across multiple datasets, and transparent data sharing pathways.
  - Highlights barriers to monitoring: incomplete metadata for certain variables, missing concentration readings, and occasional observer gaps in surveys.
- Relevance to policy and decision-making
  - Provides empirical measures to evaluate how plant trait diversity and drought conditions influence pollination services and floral resource provisioning.
  - Can inform policies on habitat management, biodiversity maintenance, and drought resilience by quantifying nectar resources and pollinator activity under varying community compositions and drought scenarios.
- Limitations and considerations for future monitoring
  - Gaps in nectar concentration data and occasional survey losses require careful data handling and imputation strategies.
  - Complex plot design and trait-group classifications may necessitate standardized trait frameworks for cross-study comparability.
