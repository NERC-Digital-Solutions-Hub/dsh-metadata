## Summary
- Study measures soluble, chemically exchangeable, and isotopically exchangeable UO2^2+ concentrations in 20 soils from central England after lab contamination and long-term incubation.
- Aimed to understand long-term U(VI) transformations, binding strength in aerobic soils, and implications for mobility and plant bioavailability under temperate conditions.
- Data enable quantification of U(VI) transformation kinetics and support development of predictive models of UVI mobility in soils.

## Background and Objectives
- Uranium is a naturally occurring radionuclide relevant to nuclear waste disposal; its long-term environmental impact depends on its mobility and bioavailability.
- Prior knowledge: U(VI) solubility in soils is well-studied, but predicting long-term bioavailability to plants in aerobic soils from simple extractions is difficult.
- This work uses a controlled laboratory incubation to track U(VI) speciation over 619 days, informing models of long-term mobility and availability.

## Study Design and Sample Collection
- Twenty topsoil samples (0–15 cm) collected from various central England locations; soils differ in land use, pH, and organic carbon content.
- Each soil collected as composite of ~3 kg field-moist material, sieved to <4 mm, and characterized for pH (CaCl2) and organic C content.

## Experimental Setup
- Soils contaminated with U(VI) as UO2^2+ at 5000 µg U VI per kg dry soil.
- Contaminated material divided into three microcosms per soil; incubated in darkness at 10.0 ± 1.0 °C for 619 days to remain field-moist and avoid anaerobiosis.
- Gas exchange allowed via a small lid hole; incubation spanned Nov 2014 to Aug 2016.

## Fractionation and Measurements
- At sampling, ~4 g soil extracted with 20 mL 0.01 M KNO3 to quantify soluble U(VI).
- ~2 g soil extracted with 20 mL 1 M Mg(NO3)2 (with added 6 µg 233UO2^2+ and 6 µg 236UO2^2+ per kg soil) to determine chemically exchangeable U.
- Isotopically exchangeable (labile) U quantified by isotopic exchange using the 233U and 236U tracers after equilibration.
- Data produced include concentrations of soluble, exchangeable, and labile U fractions (µg U per kg dry weight).

## Analytical Methods
- Extracts analysed by ICP-MS (iCAP-Q) with internal standard Ir; rapid uptake module used.
- Isotopic analysis separately considered 233U, 236U, and 238U; spike corrections applied for mass discrimination.
- Calculations include estimates of U exchangeability (U_E) and distribution coefficients (Kd) using isotope intensities and extractant volumes/masses.

## Data Output and Potential Use
- Time-resolved data across 619 days showing how U(VI) fractions evolve in different soil types.
- Enables modelling of long-term UVI mobility and bioavailability in aerobic soils under temperate conditions.
- Provides insight into binding strength and controls on U(VI) speciation in soils with varying pH and organic carbon.

## Limitations and Considerations for Data Leaders
- Lab-based microcosms vs. field conditions; extrapolation to real ecosystems requires caution.
- Complex fractionation scheme (soluble, exchangeable, labile/isotopically exchangeable) necessitates careful metadata and clear documentation for reuse.
- Limited geographic scope (central England soils) and long incubation may affect generalizability.
