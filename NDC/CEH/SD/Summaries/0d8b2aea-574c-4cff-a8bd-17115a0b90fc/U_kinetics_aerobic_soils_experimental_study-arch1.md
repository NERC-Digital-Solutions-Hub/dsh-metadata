## Aim
- Quantify the kinetics of U(VI) transformations in 20 soils from central England after laboratory contamination with UO2^2+ and 619 days of incubation at 10 °C.
- Determine soluble, chemically exchangeable, and isotopically exchangeable (labile) U fractions to assess long-term mobility and bioavailability of U(VI) in aerobic soils under temperate conditions.
- Provide data to support development of models for U(VI) mobility and availability in soils.

## Study design and soils
- 20 topsoil samples (0–15 cm) collected from central England, with four sub-samples per composite (~3 kg field-moist soil).
- Soils span diverse land uses: arable, grassland, moorland, woodland; wide pH and organic carbon (OC) ranges.
- Soil pH and OC measured; OC ranges from 1.7% to 38.6%; pH ranges from 3.41 to 8.00.
- Soils catalogued with codes (e.g., CO-A, EV-A, NP-A, SR-A, WK-A, etc.) and locations/coordinates provided.

## U addition and incubation setup
- Contaminated soils with U(VI) as UO2^2+ at 5000 µg U(VI) per kg dry soil.
- Approximately 1.5 kg soil per microcosm, distributed across three bottles per soil to form separate microcosms.
- Incubated in darkness at 10.0 ± 1.0 °C for 619 days, with a single small lid hole per bottle to allow gas exchange while minimizing water loss.

## Fractionation and measurements
- Periodic differentiation of uranium pools using chemical extractions:
  - Soluble U: extracted with 0.01 M KNO3 (µg U kg^-1 DW).
  - Chemically exchangeable U: extracted with 1 M Mg(NO3)2 (µg U kg^-1 DW).
  - Isotopically exchangeable (labile) U: equilibrated with 1 M Mg(NO3)2 plus 233U/236U tracers to quantify isotopic exchangeability (µg U kg^-1 DW).
- Isotopic tracing enables determination of the labile/reactive U fraction via changes in 233U, 236U, and 238U isotopic abundances.

## Analyses and calculations
- Uranium concentrations measured by ICP-MS (iCAP-Q) with an autosampler and internal standard (Ir) added on a separate line.
- Method specifics:
  - Total U (0.01 M KNO3 and Mg(NO3)2 extracts): dwell times and run settings described (0.01 s, 150 sweeps, 3 runs per sample).
  - Isotopic analysis (233U, 236U, 238U): dwell time 0.5 s, 145 sweeps; 233U/236U spike used every 12 samples to correct mass discrimination.
- Isotopic exchangeability (U_E) calculated as:
  U_E (µg g^-1) = 238Uss × (Ki_d × + Vs_s × ws^-1) [Note: equation shows relationship between measured isotopes, extractant volume, soil mass, and a distribution coefficient Ki_d*]
- Distribution coefficient Ki_d^i derived from differences in spike vs. suspension U intensities.

## Data structure and reporting
- Fractional U data reported as µg U per kg dry soil for each extraction type (soluble, exchangeable, labile/isotopically exchangeable) across incubation days (619 days total).
- Table 2 defines each extraction’s purpose and what is measured; Table 1 (referenced) lists soil location, pH, and OC content.
- Data include missing values denoted by dashes where data were not available.

## Outputs and implications
- Provides quantitative insight into the binding strength and mobility of U(VI) in a range of soil types under temperate, aerobic conditions.
- Enables estimation of long-term U(VI) mobility and bioavailability through observed changes in soluble, exchangeable, and isotopically exchangeable pools.
- Supports development of predictive models for U(VI) behavior in soils, with potential application to environmental risk assessments related to nuclear fuel cycle waste and uranium contamination.
