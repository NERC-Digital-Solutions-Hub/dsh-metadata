## Overview
- Data: measurements of soluble, chemically exchangeable, and isotopically exchangeable UO2^2+ concentrations in soils.
- Experimental setup: laboratory incubation of 20 central England soils contaminated with UO2^2+, incubated in the dark, field-moist state, at 10 ± 1 °C for 619 days.
- Purpose: quantify kinetics of U(VI) transformations and assess binding strength in aerobic soils to inform models of long-term U(VI) mobility and plant bioavailability under temperate conditions.

## Experimental design and soil sampling
- Soil collection: topsoil (0–15 cm) from 20 locations with diverse land uses (arable, grassland, moorland, woodland); composite ~3 kg per sample.
- Site characterization: pH (measured in 0.01 M CaCl2) and organic carbon content (measured by CNS analyser) recorded for each soil.
- Soil range: pH from 3.41 to 8.00; organic C from 1.7% to 38.6%.

## U addition and incubation
- Contamination: soils mixed with U(VI) solution to achieve 5000 µg U(VI) per kg dry soil.
- Microcosm setup: soils distributed into three bottles per soil; lids with a single small gas-exchange hole to maintain aerobic conditions and minimize water loss.
- Incubation conditions: darkness, 10.0 ± 1.0 °C, incubated for 619 days (Nov 2014 – Aug 2016).

## Fractionation and measurements
- Sampling: at each time point, ~4 g soil extracted for soluble U; ~2 g soil for exchangeable U; both via defined extraction procedures.
- Soluble U: extracted with 0.01 M KNO3 to approximate soil pore water ionic strength; analyzed as µg U per kg dry weight.
- Chemically exchangeable U: extracted with 1 M Mg(NO3)2 to displace weakly adsorbed U to Fe/Mn oxides.
- Isotopically exchangeable U (labile): equilibrated with 1 M Mg(NO3)2 containing ~6 µg 233UO2^2+ and 6 µg 236UO2^2+ per kg soil; allows isotopic exchange with tracers.
- Analysis: ICP-MS (iCAP-Q) with internal standard; isotopic measurements (233U, 236U, 238U) using spike corrections; multistage sample handling via autosampler and rapid uptake module.

## Data and calculations
- Reported data: concentrations in µg U kg^-1 of dry soil for soluble, exchangeable, and labile fractions; time-stamped by incubation days.
- Isotopic exchangeability calculation: U_E (µg g^-1) derived from 238U_ss, spike corrections, volumes, soil mass, and a distribution coefficient (K_d^i).
- Distribution coefficient: K_d^i calculated from intensities of 233U and 236U in spike versus soil suspension.
- Note: any missing data are indicated as dashes.

## Analytical methodology
- Instrumentation: iCAP-Q ICP-MS with autosampler (Cetac ASX-520) and PFA nebulizer; Ir internal standard (5 µg L^-1) on a separate line.
- Acquisition: low dwell times and multiple sweeps for total U and isotopic analyses; spike included every 12 samples to correct for mass discrimination.
- Data processing: standard corrections for isotopic mixtures and adsorption/desorption behavior to quantify soluble, exchangeable, and labile U fractions.

## Relevance and applications
- Enables quantitative assessment of U(VI) transformations and binding strength across diverse soils under controlled temperate, aerobic conditions.
- Provides empirical data to support models of long-term U(VI) mobility and plant bioavailability in soils, informing environmental health monitoring and risk assessment.

## Limitations and considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Laboratory conditions (constant 10 °C, dark, field-moist) may differ from in-situ field environments.
- Comprehensive metadata (soil properties, sampling coordinates, pH, organic carbon) are provided, facilitating data reuse and cross-site comparisons.
- The structured fractionation and isotopic-tracer approach enhance transparency and reproducibility, aligning with data governance and open-data practices for monitoring frameworks.
