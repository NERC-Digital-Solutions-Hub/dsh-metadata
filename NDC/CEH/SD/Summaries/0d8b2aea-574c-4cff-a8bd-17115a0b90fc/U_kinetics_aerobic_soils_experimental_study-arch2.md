- Purpose and scope
  - Measure soluble, chemically exchangeable, and isotopically exchangeable UO2^2+ in soils after laboratory contamination and long-term incubation to understand U(VI) transformations, binding strength, and potential long-term mobility in aerobic soils under temperate conditions.
  - Data support development of predictive models for U(VI) mobility and plant availability in soils.

- Background and objectives
  - Uranium is a naturally occurring radionuclide that can migrate as uranyl ions or ligand complexes in groundwater.
  - Long-term environmental impact of U after geological disposal is of interest; simple chemical extractions struggle to predict bioavailability in aerobic soils.
  - The study aims to quantify transformation kinetics of U(VI) in soils and provide insight into binding strength across soils with differing properties.

- Experimental design (overall)
  - 20 topsoil samples (0–15 cm) from central England, representing arable, grassland, moorland, and woodland soils.
  - Soils were contaminated with UO2^2+ at 5000 µg U VI per kg dry soil.
  - Each soil was divided into three microcosms and incubated in darkness at 10.0 ± 1.0°C for 619 days.
  - Incubation setup included small lid holes for gas exchange to prevent anaerobic conditions while minimizing water loss.

- Soil sampling and characterization
  - Composite samples created by mixing sub-samples from a ~5 m^2 grid to form ~3 kg field-moist soil.
  - Soil pH measured in 0.01 M CaCl2; organic carbon (OC) content determined with an elemental analyser.
  - Soils spanned a range of land uses and chemical properties (pH values from ~3.4 to ~8.0; OC up to ~38%).

- U addition and incubation setup
  - U VI contamination achieved with a UO2^2+ solution, ensuring approximately uniform distribution among microcosms.
  - Microcosms allowed gas exchange but controlled water loss, maintaining field-moist conditions.

- Microcosm sampling and uranium fractionation
  - Periodic sampling used three sequential extraction schemes:
    - Soluble U: 0.01 M KNO3 extractant (approximates pore water ionic strength).
    - Chemically exchangeable U: 1 M Mg(NO3)2 to displace weakly bound U, representing adsorbed U on Fe/Mn oxides and other surfaces.
    - Isotopically exchangeable (labile) U: 1 M Mg(NO3)2 with added 233U and 236U tracers to quantify U that can exchange with the tracers.
  - For each soil, fractions are expressed as µg U per kg dry weight (DW).

- Analyses and calculations
  - U concentrations were measured by ICP-MS (iCAP-Q) with an internal Ir standard; isotopic measurements used 233U, 236U, and 238U.
  - Isotopic exchangeability (U_E) is estimated using a defined equation that accounts for spike-derived adsorbed U intensities, extractant volumes, soil mass, and a distribution coefficient (K_d).
  - The methodology distinguishes soluble, exchangeable, and labile U pools to reveal transformation kinetics and binding strength in each soil.

- Key outputs and intended use
  - A dataset detailing the fractions of U present as soluble, exchangeable, and labile (isotopically exchangeable) over 619 days across 20 soils.
  - Insights into how soil properties (e.g., pH, organic carbon) influence U(VI) transformations and mobility in aerobic, temperate soils.
  - Foundational data to inform models of long-term U VI mobility and plant-available U in similar soil systems.
