# Material Flow Analysis of Nutrients in Leicestershire and Leicester City (2019)

- Purpose
  - Map and quantify how nutrients, specifically nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), are embedded in regional organic waste streams to identify intervention opportunities for improved resource, economic, and environmental performance.
  - Support holistic regional nutrients management within a defined case study region (Leicestershire County and Leicester City) for informing policy and future monitoring.

- Data and Timeframe
  - Data types: organic material flows and their nutrient contents (N, P) presented as Sankey diagrams and spreadsheets.
  - Units: tonnes and nutrient content in kg per tonne of material.
  - Region and year: Leicestershire County and Leicester City; data focused on year 2019 (pre-COVID), with data collection and modelling conducted 2022–2023.

- Methodology and Approach
  - Core method: Material Flow Analysis (MFA) to map stocks and flows of organic waste and nutrients from source to end destination.
  - Data integration: combined raw waste stream quantities, processing/disposal options, downstream outputs, and nutrient contents (primarily via mass balance modelling).
  - Modelling framework: utilisation of Processing Units (PUs) to estimate outputs (e.g., anaerobic digestion, composting, incineration, wastewater treatment); supporting data from literature.
  - Visualization: generation of Sankey diagrams (via Excel model and SankeyMATIC) to illustrate flows for green waste, food waste, slurry/manure, and wastewater.

- Waste Streams Considered
  - Green waste (gardening/parks): regional waste treated within the county or city, with destinations including composting, landfilling, or other fates.
  - Food waste
    - Production/processing waste: flows within and outside the county, with destinations including AD, composting, land spreading, or other processing.
    - Consumption waste (household and non-household): household estimates based on per-household generation rates; destinations inferred from residual waste patterns and city-specific arrangements.
  - Slurry and manure: on-farm stock and application destinations informed by Defra data.
  - Wastewater: main stream treated by Severn Trent (~125 million tonnes/year for averaging; note variability with rainfall) plus septic tank sludge; nutrient contents sourced from operational data.

- Stakeholder Engagement
  - First workshop (July 2022): identified nutrient sources, system actors, outcomes, opportunities, bottlenecks; developed a qualitative map of nutrient sources and links.
  - Second workshop (February 2021) and follow-ups: validated MFA model assumptions, identified data gaps, and refined technical/economic/regulatory considerations; discussed additional viable options for Leicestershire context.

- Data Sources and Handling
  - Waste data interrogation: Environment Agency (EA) 2019 Waste Data Interrogator (datasets for “waste received” and “waste removed”; regulatory context via EU Waste Catalogue codes and Recovery/Disposal codes).
  - Handling of data limitations: several destinations could not be uniquely determined from EA codes; required assumptions based on facility type and coding rules (Tables 1.1–1.4 for green waste and food waste destinations).
  - Specific streams
    - Green waste: destination assumptions based on local and city coding rules.
    - Food production/processing waste: destination mappings using county and city tables; AD, composting, land spreading, etc.
    - Food consumption waste: household estimates and residual waste patterns; city-specific AD involvement.
    - Slurry/manure: Defra data on livestock volumes and land use.
    - Wastewater: Severn Trent data (avg year), plus septic tank sludge data from EA.
  - Data gaps and assumptions: acknowledged limitations in metadata precision, potential double-counting from transfer-only flows, and reliance on point estimates rather than ranges.

- Mass Balances and Processing Units
  - Primary processing units evaluated for nutrient recovery potential: anaerobic digestion (food waste and sewage sludge), composting, incineration, and wastewater treatment.
  - Data sources for PU mass balances drawn from UK/Western Europe literature, including Banks et al., Tezel et al., Andersen et al., IPCC waste incineration guidelines, Henze & Concha, EA monitoring, and other peer-reviewed sources.
  - Outputs focus on material flows and nutrient recovery; energy flows are not depicted in the PU diagrams.

- Outputs and Visualizations
  - MFA results presented as Sankey diagrams illustrating:
    - Overall system flow (Figure 1.5)
    - Green waste sub-systems (Figures 1.6a, 1.6b)
    - Food waste sub-systems (Figures 1.7a, 1.7b)
    - Slurry and manure (Figure 1.8)
    - Wastewater (Figure 1.9)
  - Nutrient distribution (Figure 1.10) shows N and P across sources and sinks (slurry/manure and wastewater losses partially excluded).

- Key Findings for Monitoring and Policy
  - Visualizable nutrient stocks and flows facilitate identification of intervention points to improve resource efficiency and environmental performance.
  - Regional focus captures how local governance, infrastructure, and household behaviours influence nutrient recovery pathways.
  - The integrated MFA approach supports evidence-based decision making for policy alignment, technology investment (e.g., AD vs. composting vs. incineration), and regional circular economy strategies.

- Limitations and Areas for Future Work
  - Data limitations: limited data collection within project scope; missing losses during transport/storage; potential double-counting for transfer flows; precision of R&D coding in EA data.
  - Parameter uncertainties: PU modelling relies on literature with single-point values; real-world variability suggests using ranges.
  - Scope limitations: excluded run-off, imports/exports of nutrients, and chemical fertilizer inputs; future work should incorporate broader nutrient flows for a complete regional nutrient circularity assessment.
  - Governance and data sharing: challenges around publicly sharing underlying datasets; emphasis on data governance to ensure standards, transparency, and accessibility.

- Monitoring Framework Implications for Authors of Monitoring Frameworks
  - Demonstrates a structured process for developing a regional monitoring framework: define boundaries, assemble data, engage stakeholders, model processing units, and produce decision-relevant visualizations.
  - Highlights practical challenges in data access, metadata quality, and data governance that must be addressed to sustain ongoing monitoring.
  - Emphasizes transparency in assumptions, documentation of data sources, and clear communication of uncertainties to inform policy and practice.
