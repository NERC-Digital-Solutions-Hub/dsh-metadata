Nutrient flows in the organic waste system of Leicestershire County and Leicester City

- What is in scope
  - Mapping organic waste flows and associated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents using material flow analysis (MFA).
  - Focus on nutrients embedded in waste streams generated within the region and how they are processed or disposed of, to inform regional nutrient management.
  - Waste streams considered: green waste, food waste, slurry/manure, and wastewater.
  - Time frame: data for 2019; data collection and modelling activities conducted July 2022–July 2023.
  - Outputs designed to support self-serve data use and identify improvement opportunities (e.g., nutrient recovery options, policy alignment).

- What was done and how
  - Methodology: MFA mass balances of primary processing units (PUs) to estimate nutrient recovery potential; visualization via Sankey diagrams (constructed using an Excel model and SankeyMATIC).
  - Data gathering and integration:
    - Primary data sources include the Environment Agency’s Waste Data Interrogator (2019) for regulated waste flows, local wastewater data, and sector-specific datasets (green waste, food waste, slurry/manure, wastewater).
    - Household and non-household waste estimation used supplementary sources (e.g., WRAP, ONS) due to data gaps in the EA dataset.
    - Wastewater volumes drawn from Severn Trent (2022 data with a 125 million tonnes/year average assumed; acknowledges wetter years could exceed 150 million tonnes).
    - Slurry/manure quantities and nutrient contents informed by Defra/Environment Information Data Centre datasets.
  - Stakeholder engagement:
    - First stakeholder workshop (July 2022) identified nutrient sources, system actors, desired outcomes, opportunities, bottlenecks, and produced a qualitative map of the nutrient flows.
    - A second workshop (February 2021) refined the draft MFA model, discussed technical/economic/environmental/regulatory issues, data gaps, and viability of options for Leicestershire.
  - Modelling specifics:
    - Processing units include anaerobic digestion (food waste and sewage sludge), composting, incineration, and wastewater treatment with associated outputs (sludges, AD effluent, etc.).
    - The approach emphasizes mass balances of PUs (energy flows omitted) and uses literature-derived parameter values and UK/Western European context data for representative scenarios.
    - Sankey diagrams illustrate raw waste streams, processing/disposal outputs, and nutrient contents (N and P) across the region and sub-systems.

- What was mapped and the outputs
  - Comprehensive MFA model of nutrient stocks and flows in:
    - Green waste (Leicester City and Leicestershire County sub-systems)
    - Food waste (Leicester City and Leicestershire County sub-systems)
    - Slurry and manure (regional, with on-farm application data)
    - Wastewater (regional, including septic tank sludge)
  - Quantitative results presented as Sankey diagrams (tonnes/year) for 2019, with N and P contents highlighted in raw streams and in processing/disposal outputs.
  - Distribution of N and P across sources and sinks (note: slurry/manure and N loss to N2 during wastewater treatment excluded from certain plots).

- Key findings and focus areas
  - The maps identify major nutrient sources and critical control points for recovery opportunities and environmental performance improvements.
  - The approach highlights potential intervention points for nutrient circularity, waste processing choices, and regional coordination.
  - Emphasis on understanding όπου nutrient losses occur and where nutrient recovery can be maximized (e.g., AD, composting, land application, and wastewater streams).

- Data quality, limitations, and uncertainties
  - Data gaps and assumptions due to incomplete EC waste codes and destinations in the EA dataset; some streams marked as transfer/storage introduce potential double-counting risks.
  - PU parameter values drawn from diverse literature; results shown as representative point values rather than ranges; actual values may vary in reality.
  - Limited treatment of losses and chemical changes during transport and storage; narrow focus on waste streams (future work should incorporate run-offs, import/export of nutrients, and chemical fertilizer inputs for a fuller regional nutrient picture).
  - The mapping is region-bound and does not include wastes transported into the region; some streams (a, b) originate in-region and are processed elsewhere, affecting boundary conditions.

- Section 2: Mass balances of waste processing units (PUs)
  - Purpose: to quantify the amount of nutrients that can potentially be recovered from key processing pathways.
  - PUs covered: anaerobic digestion of food waste and sewage sludge; composting of organic waste; incineration of food waste, sewage sludge, and green waste; wastewater treatment facility.
  - Data sources for mass balance inputs include a set of UK/Western European studies and/or agency datasets (references [1]-[15] listed).
  - The mass balance approach excludes energy flows to focus on nutrient recovery potential; emissions and gas streams (CO2, CH4, N2O) are noted where relevant.
  - Tables and figures (e.g., 2.1 and associated references) document the literature basis for mass balance estimates used in the PUs.

- Limitations and suggested future work
  - Extend data to include broader nutrient flows beyond waste streams (e.g., run-offs, feed/food imports-exports, fertilizer inputs) for a more complete regional nutrient circularity assessment.
  - Develop ranges for key parameters to capture variability and uncertainty rather than single-point estimates.
  - Improve data precision for destinations coded in EA datasets; reduce double-counting by refining treatment vs transfer classifications.
  - Expand stakeholder engagement to validate assumptions and explore additional local viability of nutrient recovery options.
