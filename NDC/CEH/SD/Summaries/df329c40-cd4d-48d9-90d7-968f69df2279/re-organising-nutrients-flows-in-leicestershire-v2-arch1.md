# Organic waste flow system and nutrients stocks and flows in Leicestershire and Leicester City

- Purpose and aim
  - Quantify how nutrients, specifically nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), are embedded in regional waste streams to identify intervention points for improved resource use, economic performance, and environmental outcomes.
  - Provide evidence to support holistic regional nutrients management and framing of improvement opportunities.

- Geographic and temporal scope
  - Region: Leicestershire County and Leicester City.
  - Time basis: main data from year 2019 (pre-COVID); study conducted July 2022–July 2023.

- Data, materials, and measurements
  - Data types: organic material flows and their nutrient contents, presented as Sankey diagrams and spreadsheets; all flows in tonnes and nutrients in kg/tonne where applicable.
  - Data sources:
    - Environment Agency Waste Data Interrogator (2019) for waste received/removed, origins, and waste types (European Waste Catalogue codes).
    - Waste planning authorities and local authorities for origin and processing context.
    - Severn Trent (2022) wastewater volumes and nutrient contents; septic tank sludge data from EA datasets.
    - Manure volume estimates by livestock type and land use (Defra EIDC).
    Household and non-household waste generation and destination assumptions (based on prior studies and local information).
    Publicly available data portals and literature for mass balance inputs.

- Methodology and modelling approach
  - Main approach: Material Flow Analysis (MFA) to map nutrient stocks and flows from raw waste streams to processing/disposal endpoints.
  - Data components:
    - Quantities of raw waste streams (tonne/year).
    - Processing/disposal options applied to raw waste streams.
    - Output streams arising from processing/disposal (tonne/year per tonne of raw waste).
    - Nutrient contents (N, P) in each stream (kg nutrient per kg material or per stream).
  - Processing units (PUs) and mass balances (Section 2): quantify nutrients recoverable via key processes.
    - Anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste and sewage sludge.
    - Composting of organic waste.
    - Incineration of food waste, sewage sludge, and green waste.
    - Wastewater treatment facility operations (including sludge and AD effluent).
  - Visualization and data consolidation:
    - Excel-based model to integrate EA data and PU outputs.
    - Sankey diagrams generated with SankeyMATIC to illustrate flows (Figure 1.5 and related figures).
  - Validation and refinement:
    - Two stakeholder workshops (July 5, 2022; Feb 2021) to identify key sources, system links, bottlenecks, and data gaps; iterative refinement of MFA model and assumptions.
    - One-on-one meetings to address data gaps and validate options.

- Key waste streams and scope
  - Green waste (parks and gardening) and food waste (processing/consumption) within the region, with some streams processed outside the region.
  - Slurry and manure (on-farm uses and limited off-farm destinations).
  - Wastewater (central treatment by Severn Trent and septic tank sludge).
  - Timeframe: 2019 data used for mapping; explicit focus on regional inputs and regional processing/disposal destinations.

- Processing units and nutrient recovery focus (Section 2)
  - Mass balance of primary processing units to assess recoverable nutrients (N, P) from:
    - Anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste and sewage sludge.
    - Composting of organic waste.
    - Incineration of food waste, sewage sludge, and green waste.
    - Wastewater treatment works (WwTW) and related sludge/AD outputs.
  - Data sources for mass balances include UK/Western European studies and reports (references listed in the document).

- Key findings and outputs
  - MFA results presented as Sankey diagrams for:
    - Overall nutrient flows (Figure 1.5).
    - Green waste, food waste, slurry/manure, and wastewater sub-systems (Figures 1.6–1.9).
    - Distribution of N and P across sources and sinks (Figure 1.10; note: slurry/manure and N losses to N2 in wastewater are excluded).
  - Diagrams illustrate volumes of raw streams and post-processing streams, with N and P contents highlighted for raw streams and PU outputs.

- Data handling, assumptions, and limitations
  - Assumptions necessitated by data gaps and coding ambiguities in EA datasets (e.g., transfer vs. treatment destinations).
  - Potential for double-counting due to streams designated for transfer/storage rather than processing.
  - PU modelling relies on representative point values from diverse literature; results should be treated with caution, acknowledging variability.
  - Limitations include:
    - Limited data collection scope and not addressing losses/chemical changes during transport and storage.
    - Incomplete coverage of run-offs and other nutrient flows beyond waste streams.
    - Need for broader integration of inputs such as imports/exports of food and feed and chemical fertilizer use for a fuller nutrient circularity picture.

- Future work and recommendations
  - Expand data coverage to include run-offs, food/feed import-export, and fertilizer inputs for a comprehensive regional nutrient cycle.
  - Incorporate ranges or distributions for PU parameters rather than single-point values to better reflect variability.
  - Improve data accessibility and standardization; ensure datasets are discoverable with metadata.
  - Reconcile coding uncertainties in datasets (e.g., EA R&D codes) to reduce misclassification and potential double-counting.

- Practical implications and intended impact
  - The study maps the current organic waste-to-nutrient pathways to identify leverage points for improved nutrient recovery, circularity, and regional sustainability.
  - Results can inform policy alignment, council coordination, and investment decisions in waste processing technologies and infrastructure.
