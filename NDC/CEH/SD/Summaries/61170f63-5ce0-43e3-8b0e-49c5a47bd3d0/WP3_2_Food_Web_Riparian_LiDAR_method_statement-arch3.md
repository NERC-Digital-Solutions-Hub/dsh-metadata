# WP3.2 Food web sites riparian vegetation structure data

- What was recorded
  - Measure of the extent and complexity of riparian vegetation upstream of three chalkstream sites (River Till, River Wylye, Nine Mile River) in the Wessex chalk area.
  - Derived from LiDAR data; statistics calculated for each defined upstream area: minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of vegetation heights.
  - Statistics computed for all vegetation and separately for trees (>2 m) and low vegetation (<2 m); also included total vegetation area and volume.

- Data structure and metrics
  - Distances upstream: 100 m, 200 m, and 1 km along the watercourse from the sampling location.
  - 10 m-wide riparian buffer strips on each bank (two banks).
  - For each area: minimum, maximum, mean, and SD of vegetation heights; area (m2) and volume (m3) of vegetation.
  - Vegetation categorization: Trees (>2 m) and Low vegetation (<2 m); buildings masked out.
  - Metadata and LiDAR-derived statistics are documented with column definitions (see table below).

- Location
  - Collected within the Wessex chalk area, at three chalkstream sites: River Till, River Wylye, Nine Mile River.

- Temporal coverage
  - LiDAR data requested and obtained in April 2014; processed subsequently to derive vegetation statistics.

- Data collection methodology
  - Data gathered using airborne LiDAR, capturing up to ~100,000 ground measurements per second.
  - Ground-resolution capability ranges from 25 cm to 2 m.
  - Data archived by Environment Agency; areas defined relative to each site as buffers and upstream distances.
  - Vegetation height data split into trees (>2 m) and low vegetation (<2 m); buildings masked out.
  - Completeness verified via visual checks in ArcGIS; cross-checks ensuring sums of Tree and Low equal All values.

- Purpose and rationale
  - To understand relationships between in-stream biological communities and catchment/riparian land use.
  - Sites chosen to span a gradient of catchment land cover from calcareous grassland/woodland to arable/improved grassland.

- Stakeholders and responsibilities
  - Data requested by Dr John Murphy (Queen Mary University of London).
  - Statistics generated by Dr John Redhead (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology).
  - Environment Agency LiDAR data source; processed results used in analysis.

- Data completeness and quality assurance
  - Data are described as complete.
  - Quality checks include visual validation of buffer strips and consistency checks that vegetation totals (Tree + Low) match the All category.

- Dataset schema (selected column headings and definitions)
  - RIVER_ID: Unique river identifier in Britain
  - SITE_ID: Unique sampling location identifier
  - RIVER_NAME: River name
  - SITE_NAME: Site name
  - NGR / EASTING / NORTHING: Location coordinates (OS grid)
  - Distances_upstream_m: Upstream distance (km) from the NGR for the 10 m buffer strip; values include 100 m, 200 m, 1 km
  - Vegetation: Summary of LiDAR data for vegetation heights; trees (>2 m) vs low vegetation (<2 m); buildings masked out
  - AREA_m2: Area encompassed by the buffer strip(s)
  - VOLUME_m3: Vegetation volume within the buffer strip(s)
  - MIN_HEIGHT_m / MAX_HEIGHT_m / MEAN_HEIGHT_m / SD_HEIGHT_m: Height statistics of vegetation within the sampled area
