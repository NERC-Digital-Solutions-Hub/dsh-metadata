# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a crosswalk linking Broad Habitats to LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants (Suclasses) as displayed in maps.
  - Supports comparison and integration of LCM2000 habitat classifications with field survey data (CS2000) and field survey estimates (FS).

- Key datasets and sources
  - LCM2000: Land Cover Map 2000, cover-based on a 25 m grid.
  - FS: Field survey estimates (Haines-Young et al. 2000) used for calibration/validation.
  - CS2000: Field survey squares used for cross-walking with LCM2000 classifications.

- What the document contains (highlights by tables)
  - Table 5: Coverage by Subclasses and Aggregates
    - Presents area in km2 for broad habitats across GB, broken down by England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and GB totals.
    - Examples include Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & Horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Montane habitats, Built-up/urban areas, Coastal and Supralittoral/Littoral categories, and the overall UK totals (e.g., UK LCM2000 total ≈ 246,688 km2).
    - Shows how aggregates and country-level totals compare between LCM2000 classifications.
  - Table 6: LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) vs FS field survey estimates
    - Provides calibration anchors by broad habitat and country (England, Wales, Scotland, NI, GB).
    - For each habitat, FS low/high estimates are given alongside LCM2000 values, highlighting where uncalibrated LCM2000 aligns with or diverges from FS estimates (95% confidence ranges).
    - Illustrates that calibration is needed to reconcile LCM2000 with field-derived area estimates across regions.
  - Tables 8–10: Summary correspondence matrices
    - Table 8: GB-wide summary correspondences (per 1000) comparing LCM2000 with CS2000; includes broad habitats, urban-generalised areas, target classes, and aggregate classes.
    - Table 9: England & Wales subset (per 1000) with similar cross-walks.
    - Table 10: Scotland subset (per 1000) with detailed cross-walks.
    - These matrices quantify how often LCM2000 classes align with CS2000 classifications, including adjustments for urban generalisation and cross-class mappings.
    - The results show varying levels of correspondence across habitats and classes, reflecting differences in classification schemes and data sources.
  - Footnotes and methodological notes
    - Clarify that LCM2000 statistics come from full cover counts on a 25 m grid; FS statistics from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
    - Explain coastal coverage variability, 1 km-square survey definitions, and differences in inclusion/exclusion of offshore areas.
    - Note that some totals depend on definitions of the FS population and urban generalisation.

- Key findings and implications for data work
  - Crosswalk utility
    - The linked tables enable translating LCM2000 broad habitats into LCM target classes and CS2000/FS categories, supporting data integration and comparative analyses.
  - Calibration need
    - FS estimates frequently bracket or diverge from LCM2000 values, indicating a need for calibration and adjustment before using the data for precise quantification or change detection.
  - Uncertainty and coverage
    - Presence of n/a, low/high FS ranges, and coastal variability highlight uncertainties in UK-wide habitat area estimates and the importance of region-specific calibration.
  - Urban generalisation
    - Tables consistently note urban-generalisation effects, indicating that some habitat classes in urban areas may require special handling to maintain map accuracy.
  - Data product opportunities
    - The crosswalks and correspondence matrices support developing dashboards or reports that let users explore habitat distribution, compare LCM2000 and CS2000 classifications, and assess alignment or biases by region.
  - Limitations to consider
    - Some country-level FS data are incomplete or not available (n/a); differences in survey methods and definitions can affect comparability.
    - Total areas depend on square definitions and coastal/offshore inclusions, which vary by dataset.

- Practical takeaways for Data Support practice
  - Use the crosswalks to harmonise LCM2000 with CS2000/FS for policy, planning, and ecosystem assessments.
  - Prioritize calibration work to align LCM2000 estimates with field-derived data, especially in urban and coastal zones.
  - Develop data products (e.g., dashboards, maps, and reports) that expose habitat distributions, uncertainties, and region-specific differences to end users.
  - Document assumptions and maintain clear provenance to support reproducibility when integrating these datasets across authorities and projects.
