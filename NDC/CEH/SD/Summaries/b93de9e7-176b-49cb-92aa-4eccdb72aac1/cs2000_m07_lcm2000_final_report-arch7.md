# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents broad habitats used in LCM2000 and how they relate to LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants (with Suclasses shown by map display colours).
  - Provides a structured crosswalk for map display and analysis across the UK.

- Classification structure
  - Broad Habitats (BHs) are linked to LCM Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants.
  - Includes a mapping that supports visualization of spatial features for GIS products (e.g., woodlands, grasslands, arable lands, built-up areas, wetlands, coastal and marine categories).

- Intended use for GIS work
  - Facilitates translation between broad habitat categories and the LCM2000 display scheme for map production.
  - Supports interpretation of map outputs by aligning target classes, subclasses, and variants with display colours and legend items.
