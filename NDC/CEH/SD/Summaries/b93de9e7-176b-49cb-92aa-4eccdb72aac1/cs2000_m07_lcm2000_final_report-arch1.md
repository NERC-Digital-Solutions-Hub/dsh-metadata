# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the mapping between LCM2000 broad habitat target classes, their subclasses, and variants, with suclasses shown by map colors.
  - Provides a framework for comparing land cover map classifications with field-based habitat classifications across the UK.

- Structure of classifications
  - LCM2000 broad habitat target classes and their corresponding subclasses and variants (22 examples listed in the table).
  - Examples include inshore sublittoral (Sea/Estuary), standing water/canals (Water inland), littoral rock and sediment, supra-littoral rock and sediment, bogs, montane habitats, arable and horticultural, improved grassland, neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, bracken, dwarf shrub heath, fen/marsh/swamp, built-up areas, coastal/urban features, inland bare ground, and various woodland types.

- UK-wide habitat coverage (Table 5)
  - Provides land cover map (LCM2000) area estimates by broad habitat categories for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the UK as a whole.
  - UK totals (LCM2000): 246,688 km2; England 130,362 km2; Wales 20,689 km2; Scotland 77,898 km2; Northern Ireland 17,739 km2.
  - Major categories include arable & horticulture, improved grassland, semi-natural grass & bracken, mountain/heath/bog habitats, built-up areas & gardens, coastal and inland water features, and woodland (broadleaved/mixed and coniferous) with country-level breakdowns.
  - Notable large classes: arable & horticultural, improved grassland, semi-natural grass & bracken, mountain/heath/bog, built-up areas and gardens, and inland/water-associated habitats.
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and offshore inter-tidal area inclusion; totals differ depending on FS population definitions and inclusion criteria.

- Calibration against field survey (Table 6)
  - Compares uncalibrated LCM2000 cover with field survey (FS) estimates at 95% confidence intervals (low/high) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and GB as a whole.
  - Examples (GB):
    - Broadleaved/mixed & yew woodland: LCM2000 ≈ 15,259 km2; FS Low ≈ 12,750; FS High ≈ 16,670.
    - Coniferous woodland: LCM2000 ≈ 12,879; FS Low ≈ 10,672; FS High ≈ 16,808.
    - Arable & horticulture: LCM2000 ≈ 56,638; FS Low ≈ 47,944; FS High ≈ 57,036.
    - Improved grassland: LCM2000 ≈ 50,024; FS Low ≈ 33,314; FS High ≈ 39,946.
  - Shows broad agreement in some classes, but notable differences across others, indicating discrepancies between map-based and field-based classifications.
  - Footnotes emphasize methodology: LCM2000 is a full count based on a 25 m grid; FS data from Haines-Young et al. 2000; coastal coverage variability and NI/FS inclusion differences affect totals; some FS values not available (n/a).

- Crosswalks and correspondences (Tables 8–10)
  - Tables 8–10 present summary correspondence matrices linking LCM2000 classifications with CS2000 field survey squares (GB England & Wales; Scotland; and other regional breakdowns).
  - Results are expressed as correspondences per 1000 (or per 1000 units) and are bootstrapped to provide confidence intervals.
  - These matrices show how often LCM2000 target classes align with CS2000 field categories and where mismatches occur, enabling assessment of classification agreement and potential re-mapping needs.
  - Tables also illustrate the effect of generalizing urban areas and the impact of using target-class versus aggregate-class levels on correspondence.
  - The matrices cover multiple classification lines (broad habitats, 40 Land Classes strata, boundary/linear features, arable & horticulture, improved grassland, neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, bracken, dwarf shrub heath, fen/marsh/swamp, bog, standing water/rivers, inland rock, built-up areas, supralittoral rock/sediment, littoral rock/sediment, and oceanic/seas) across CS2000 and CS2000-derived crosswalks.

- Methodology and caveats
  - LCM2000 statistics derive from a full 25 m grid count; FS statistics come from Haines-Young et al. (2000).
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS are discussed in the text; coastal coverage varies with tidal state and offshore area inclusion.
  - Total coverage definitions can shift (e.g., Northern Ireland sample exclusions) and some FS data points are unavailable (n/a).
  - The mapping relies on a set of crosswalks between LCM2000 target classes, subclasses, variants, and CS2000/CS2000-derived categories, with bootstrapped confidence intervals to reflect uncertainty.

- Implications for analysts
  - The tables provide a robust framework to:
    - Calibrate and validate remote-sensing or map-based habitat classifications against field surveys.
    - Assess scale and boundary effects when using 25 m grid-based maps for local versus national analysis.
    - Identify systematic biases in LCM2000 (over- or under-estimation of particular habitat types) and adjust models or emphasise field data for critical decisions.
    - Explore habitat-type correlations and potential predictive relationships across different UK regions.
  - Highlights the importance of accounting for data provenance, scale differences, and boundary definitions when integrating LCM2000 with CS2000-based insights.

- Key takeaways for data-driven decision making
  - LCM2000 provides comprehensive UK-wide habitat coverage at 25 m resolution with explicit mappings to broad habitat targets, but differences with field-survey classifications exist and vary by habitat type.
  - Field-based CS2000 data offer detailed local validation but require careful crosswalks to LCM2000 categories to ensure accurate interpretation.
  - Calibration is feasible but must incorporate uncertainty (confidence intervals) and scale-aware interpretation, particularly for coastal, urban, and semi-natural habitats.
  - The crosswalks (Tables 8–10) enable systematic evaluation of how well map classifications align with field observations and where improvements or local adjustments may be necessary.
