# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose of the mapping: Connects Broad Habitats (BHs) to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants (with Suclasses shown by map colours) to standardise environmental monitoring formats across datasets.
- Classification layers:
  - LCM2000 Target class (high-level category, e.g., Sea/Estuary, Water inland, etc.)
  - LCM Subclasses (more detailed groupings within each target class)
  - Variants (specific habitat types within each subclass, including algae, sand, saltmarsh, grazed, etc.)
- Examples of mapped habitats:
  - Inshore sublittoral (Sea/Estuary; variants include sea)
  - Standing water/canals (Water inland)
  - Littoral rock and sediment (rock, algae-associated variants, mud/sand, etc.)
  - Supra-littoral rock and sediment (saltmarsh, grazed, dune variants, shrub/montane associations)
  - Dwarf shrub heath, montane habitats, broad-leaved/coniferous woodlands, arable/horticultural lands, improved grasslands, neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, inland bare ground, built-up/urban areas, inland rock, and various coastal/urban combinations
- Complexity and breadth:
  - Numerous target classes, subclasses, and variants across land and coastal/marine environments
  - Inclusion of urban and suburban forms (e.g., built-up areas, suburban/rural developed) and a wide array of upland, wetland, and intertidal types
- Purpose for monitoring (as reflected by the document’s scope):
  - Provide a consistent framework for assessing environmental health and policy performance over time
  - Support standardized reporting formats (maps, charts, reports) for environmental monitoring programs
  - Aid in storing and uploading derived datasets to appropriate data portals for access and reuse
