# 25m raster

- Purpose
  - Documents the creation of a 25m raster by converting land parcels within a vector dataset into a 25m grid.
  - Each 25m cell records the dominant land cover using LCM2000 Subclasses; also describes a 1km raster summarised from the 25m data.
- Metadata overview
  - 25m raster
    - Great Britain: 24,400 columns x 48,400 rows
    - Northern Ireland: 7,600 columns x 7,200 rows
    - Lower left easting/northing: GB 50,000 / 10,000; NI 180,000 / 280,000
    - Pixel size: 25 m
    - Coordinate systems: GB = British National Grid; NI = Irish National Grid
    - Projection: Transverse Mercator (GB and NI)
    - Spheroid: GB = Airy; NI = Airy Modified 1849
    - Datum: GB = OSGB 1936; NI = Ireland 1965
    - Note: Pixel center is 12.5 m from lower-left corner
  - 1km raster
    - Great Britain: 700 columns x 1,300 rows
    - Northern Ireland: 500 columns x 500 rows
    - Lower left easting/northing: GB = 0; NI = 0 (both)
    - Pixel size: 1000 m
    - Coordinate systems: GB = British National Grid; NI = Irish National Grid
    - Projection: Transverse Mercator (GB and NI)
    - Spheroid: GB = Airy; NI = Airy Modified 1849
    - Datum: GB = OSGB 1936; NI = Ireland 1965
    - Note: Pixel center is 500 m from lower-left corner

- Subclass vs Aggregate summaries
  - The 25m raster can be summarised in two ways: by LCM2000 Subclass or by LCM2000 Aggregate class.
  - Table 3 provides the mapping between Subclasses and Aggregate classes and shows attribute codes for each land cover.
  - Encoding for storage efficiency
    - LCM2000 Subclass codes are typically floating point with one decimal place but are stored as unsigned 8-bit bytes by multiplying by 10 (0-255 range).
    - Example: Water (inland) Subclass 22.1 becomes 221 in the raster dataset.

- Example mappings (highlights)
  - Sea / Estuary
    - Subclass 25m code: 221
    - 1km code: 1
    - Aggregate class: Oceanic seas
    - 1km code: 10
  - Water (inland)
    - Subclass 25m code: 131
    - 1km code: 2
    - Aggregate class: Standing open water
    - 1km code: 8
  - Littoral rock / Littoral sediment / Saltmarsh / Supra-littoral rock / Supra-littoral sediment
    - Various 25m codes (e.g., 201, 211, 212, 181, 191)
    - Corresponding 1km codes and Coastal aggregate class codes (e.g., 3 or 9)
  - Woodlands (Broad-leaved/mixed, Coniferous)
    - Subclass codes (e.g., 11 for Broad-leaved/mixed; 21 for Coniferous)
    - 1km aggregate codes reflect respective woodland classes
  - Grasses and arable lands (e.g., Improved grassland, Neutral grassland, Arable cereals)
    - Subclass codes (e.g., 51, 61, 41)
    - 1km codes map to respective Aggregate classes (e.g., Arable and horticulture; Semi-natural grassland)
  - Urban and developed areas
    - Subclass codes for Suburban/rural developed and Continuous urban
    - 1km codes map to Built up areas and gardens

- Implications for environmental monitoring
  - Consistent, dual-scale (25m and 1km) land cover representation for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
  - Standardised encoding enables efficient storage and cross-scale analysis.
  - Clear mapping between fine-grained Subclass data and broader Aggregate classes supports flexible outputs (maps, reports, charts).
  - Facilitates data sharing and interoperability by aligning with standard coordinate systems, projections, and datums.

- Notes on reuse and data access
  - The document highlights the need to increase dataset value by enabling access to underlying data and by using standardized formats and classifications to support broader analysis and policy evaluation.
