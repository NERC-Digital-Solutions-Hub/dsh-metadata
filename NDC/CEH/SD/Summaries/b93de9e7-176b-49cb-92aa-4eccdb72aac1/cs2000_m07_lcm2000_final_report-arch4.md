# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents the relationship between Broad Habitats and LCM2000 classifications (Target Class, Subclasses, Variants) used in the UK.
  - Includes the Suclasses as displayed in map colours and aligns these with corresponding categories in the CS2000/FS context where relevant.

- Classification structure
  - LCM2000 Target Class: the broad category (e.g., Sea/Estuary, Water inland, Littoral rock, Supra-littoral rock, etc.).
  - LCM Subclasses: finer groupings within each Target Class.
  - LCM Variants: specific forms or appearances within each Subclass (e.g., rock, mud, algae, dune types, urban vs. natural mixes).
  - Notes that variants are shown in map displays to aid geographic interpretation.

- Crosswalk and mapping intent
  - Enables comparison and integration between broad habitat categories and their more detailed LCM2000 representations.
  - Serves as a foundation for comparing LCM2000 data with field survey classifications (CS2000/FS) and for subsequent quantitative assessments of coverage and accuracy.

- Related data and tables implicit in the excerpt
  - Table 5: shows the coverage (km2) of Subclasses and Aggregate classes from LCM2000 and from field survey (FS) across the UK and constituent countries.
  - Table 6: presents LCM2000 cover for BHs (uncalibrated) with 95% confidence comparisons to field survey estimates (FS).
  - Tables 8–10: summarize correspondence matrices comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey results at various aggregation levels and regions (GB, England & Wales, Scotland).
  - Footnotes clarify methodology (grid-based counting, bootstrapping, coverage definitions) and note differences due to coastal/tidal definitions and population definitions in FS data.
