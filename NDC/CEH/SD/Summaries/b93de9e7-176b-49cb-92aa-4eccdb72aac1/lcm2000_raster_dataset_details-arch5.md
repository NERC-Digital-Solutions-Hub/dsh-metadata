# 25m raster

- What it is: A raster dataset created by converting land parcels from a vector dataset into a 25 m grid, recording the dominant land cover at each location using LCM2000 Subclasses.

- Great Britain (GB) 25m raster metadata:
  - Columns/width: 24,400
  - Rows/height: 48,400
  - Lower left easting: 50,000 m
  - Lower left northing: 10,000 m
  - Pixel size: 25 m
  - Coordinate system: British National Grid
  - Projection: Transverse Mercator
  - Spheroid: Airy
  - Datum: OSGB 1936
  - Note: To obtain the pixel centre, add 12.5 m to each value

- Northern Ireland (NI) 25m raster metadata:
  - Columns/width: 7,600
  - Rows/height: 7,200
  - Lower left easting: 180,000 m
  - Lower left northing: 280,000 m
  - Pixel size: 25 m
  - Coordinate system: Irish National Grid
  - Projection: Transverse Mercator
  - Spheroid: Airy Modified 1849
  - Datum: Ireland 1965
  - Note: To obtain the pixel centre, add 12.5 m to each value

- Data encoding and storage efficiency:
  - LCM2000 Subclass codes are floating point with one decimal place; to store efficiently as 8-bit integers, they are multiplied by 10 (range 0-255).
  - Example: Water (inland) Subclass 22.1 becomes 221 in the raster

- 1km raster (derived from 25m data):
  - Created by summarising the 25m raster within 1km grid
  - GB 1km raster: 700 columns x 1,300 rows
  - NI 1km raster: 500 columns x 500 rows
  - Lower left easting/northing: GB 0, NI 0
  - Pixel size: 1,000 m
  - Coordinate system, projection, spheroid, and datum match the respective GB/NI 25m datasets (GB: OSGB 1936; NI: Ireland 1965; both Transverse Mercator; Spheroids Airy and Airy Modified 1849)
  - Note: To obtain the pixel centre, add 500 m to each value

- Subclass to 1km and Aggregate class mappings (Table 3):
  - There is a comprehensive correspondence between LCM2000 Subclasses (25m and 1km) and LCM2000 Aggregate classes, including their codes

- Practical implications for Data Stewards:
  - Metadata should capture the two regional coordinate systems, projections, datums, and the pixel-centre offset notes
  - Storage considerations: 25m Subclass codes are compacted to 8-bit integers; maintain documentation of the coding scheme and the 10x multiplier
  - Interoperability: preserve and communicate the exact mappings between 25m Subclasses, 1km Subclasses, and Aggregate classes for consistent data use
  - Versioning and lineage: document how the 1km raster is derived from the 25m raster, including the aggregation method
  - Data governance: ensure consistent handling of GB vs NI grids, and maintain clear metadata to support discovery and reuse by data users with varying needs
