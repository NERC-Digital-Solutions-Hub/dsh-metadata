# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose and context
  - Presents how Broad Habitats map to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (with Suclasses shown by map colours).
  - Part of a larger effort to relate land-cover classifications to habitat types across the UK and its constituent countries.

- Data, terminology and framework
  - LCM2000: Land Cover Map 2000 classifications used as the primary data source for habitat mapping.
  - Target class, Subclass and Variant (Variant) levels define hierarchical habitat categories.
  - Suclasses are the visual map representations tied to specific variants within the broader classes.
  - The table interlinks inshore, littoral, supra-littoral, inland and coastal habitats (e.g., Sea/Estuary, Water (inland), Montane habitats, Built up areas, etc.) with corresponding LCM2000 classifications.
  - Includes a wide array of habitat types such as Broad-leaved woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Inland water, Suburban/urban, Built up areas, Supralittoral rock/sediment, Littoral rock/sediment, Saltmarsh, Coastal types, and Oceanic/seas components.

- Key implications for monitoring
  - Provides the crosswalk needed for analysts to translate LCM2000 outputs into ecologically meaningful Broad Habitats.
  - Facilitates consistency in reporting environmental health and policy performance over time by standardising habitat category references.

- Practical use for analysts
  - Aids data cleaning and transformation by clarifying how to categorise LCM2000 results into standard habitat outputs.
  - Supports downstream outputs such as maps, charts and tables used in environmental health assessments and policy evaluation.


# Table 5. The coverage (km 2 ) of Subclasses from Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) and of Aggregate classes (bold)  from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) in the UK and constituent countries.

- What this table shows
  - Area (in square kilometres) covered by Subclasses from LCM2000 and by Aggregate classes (in bold) from both LCM2000 and field survey (FS) across England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland (NI), and the UK as a whole.
  - Breakdowns by habitat type (e.g., Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable cereals, Arable horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grassland, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Mountain habitats, Inland water, Built up areas and gardens, etc.).
  - Totals by country and for the UK, including cross-checks where FS data are or are not available.

- Notable points for analysts
  - Demonstrates scale and distribution of habitat types across the UK as classified by LCM2000, with field survey data (FS) provided for several categories to enable cross-validation.
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore inter-tidal areas, affecting totals.
  - FS (field survey) data are not consistently available for every habitat across all countries, leading to differences in UK totals between LCM2000 and FS.
  - Examples of examples (illustrative, not exhaustive):
    - Broad-leaved/mixed woodland UK LCM2000 ≈ 15,600 km2; FS ≈ 15,220 km2.
    - Coniferous woodland UK LCM2000 ≈ 13,540 km2; FS ≈ 14,350 km2 (Scotland FS ≈ 9,930 km2).
    - Mountain habitats UK LCM2000 ≈ 39,711 km2; FS ≈ 39,230 km2.
    - Built up areas and gardens UK LCM2000 ≈ 16,637 km2; FS data not always available.

- Implications for monitoring and policy
  - Provides a detailed baseline of habitat extents by country and by habitat type, enabling tracking of changes over time.
  - Highlights where field validation (FS) is available and where it is not, guiding data quality assessments and future data collection priorities.
  - Indicates potential discrepancies between model-based LCM2000 estimates and field observations, informing calibration needs.

- Data quality considerations
  - Coastal and offshore inter-tidal areas introduce variability in totals; careful interpretation required for temporal comparisons.
  - Differences in definitions and geographic coverage between LCM2000 and FS can drive mismatches in reported extents.


# Table 6. LCM2000 cover (km 2 ) for BHs (uncalibrated) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and GB, compared with field survey estimates at 95% confidence (i.e. +/- 2 standard errors).

- What this table shows
  - Uncalibrated LCM2000 area estimates for Broad Habitats (BHs) by country and GB, paired with field survey (FS) estimates presented as 95% confidence intervals (Low and High).
  - Examples of habitat groups include Broadleaved/mixed and yew woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable and horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Montane habitats, Inland rock, Built up areas and gardens, Supralittoral rock and sediment, Littoral rock and sediment, Oceanic seas, and others.
  - The table provides the sense of agreement and differences between LCM2000 and FS across the UK nations, including England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and GB as a whole.

- What analysts should note
  - LCM2000 values are uncalibrated; FS provides independent field-based estimates with a 95% confidence range, enabling assessment of potential bias or calibration needs.
  - In many habitat groups, FS confidence intervals overlap with LCM2000 estimates, suggesting general comparability, but notable exceptions exist (demonstrating the need for calibration in some categories).
  - The level of agreement varies by habitat type and by country, indicating where calibration and validation efforts should be prioritized.

- Implications for monitoring
  - This table underpins the reliability assessment of LCM2000 vs. field observations, essential for long-term monitoring and trend analysis.
  - It informs where improvements in calibration, resolution, or methodology are needed to produce consistent time-series data for environmental health reporting.

- Data quality and usage considerations
  - Because LCM2000 is uncalibrated, users should treat discrepancies with FS as potential drivers for recalibration or methodological refinement.
  - The 95% FS confidence intervals provide a quantitative basis for judging the acceptability of LCM2000 estimates in policy-relevant analyses.


# Table 8. Summary correspondence matrix (results expressed per 1000) made by from comparing LCM2000 with the CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain: results are weighted estimates, using strata based on 40 Land Classes, bootstrapped to calculate confidence intervals (see text).

- What this table provides
  - A summary correspondence matrix that quantifies how often LCM2000 classifications match CS2000 field survey classifications, expressed per 1000.
  - Separate perspectives:
    - Broad Habitats (yellow)
    - Urban generalisation considerations (blue)
    - LCM2000 Target Class (pink)
    - Aggregate class levels (green)
  - Bootstrapped confidence intervals accompany the weighted correspondences.

- How to read for monitoring
  - Indicates the level of agreement between the two classification systems across habitat types and levels of aggregation.
  - Highlights areas where LCM2000 aligns well with CS2000 and areas where misalignments occur, guiding where additional validation or methodological adjustments are needed.

- Practical implications
  - Helps assess the reliability of using LCM2000-based outputs for policy monitoring when CS2000 field data are considered a reference.
  - Points to habitat groups that may require refined crosswalks or calibration to improve consistency in longitudinal reporting.

- Caveats for interpretation
  - Correspondence figures are weighted and bootstrapped; they reflect statistical uncertainty and the chosen stratification (40 Land Classes).
  - Differences in spatial resolution, survey design, and habitat definitions can influence correspondence outcomes.


# Table 9. Summary correspondence matrix (results expressed per 1000) made by from comparing LCM2000 with the CS2000 field survey squares in England and Wales: results are weighted estimates, using strata based on 40 Land Classes, bootstrapped to calculate confidence intervals (see text).

- What this table provides
  - Similar to Table 8 but focused specifically on England and Wales.
  - Presents per-1000 correspondence across Broad Habitats, with breakdowns by Target Class and Aggregates, plus bootstrapped confidence intervals.

- Practical use for analysts
  - Enables targeted assessment of LCM2000-CS2000 agreement in England and Wales, a key region for policy-relevant monitoring.
  - Helps identify habitat categories where crosswalks perform well or poorly in these two countries.

- Implications for policy monitoring
  - Informs confidence in using LCM2000-derived maps for England and Wales in reporting against CS2000-based field data.
  - Guides calibration and data integration priorities to improve cross-country comparability.

- Limitations
  - As with Table 8, results depend on stratification, survey design, and definitions; interpret with awareness of underlying methodological differences.
