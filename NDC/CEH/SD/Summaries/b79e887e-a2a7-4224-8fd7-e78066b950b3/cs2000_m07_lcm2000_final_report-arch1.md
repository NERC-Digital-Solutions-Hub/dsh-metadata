# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- purpose of the tables: to map Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) classifications (Target Class, Subclasses, Variants) to Broad Habitats (BHs) and to show how LCM2000 classifications relate to field-survey categories (CS2000) and to assess coverage across the UK.
- classification scheme:
  - LCM Target Class (e.g., Sea/Estuary, Water inland, Littoral rock, Built up areas, etc.)
  - LCM Subclasses and Variants (more detailed habitat groupings like Broad-leaved woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral grass, Calcareous grass, Acid grass, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Montane, Inland rock, Supralittoral/Littoral components, etc.)
- the mapping is presented in a series of correspondences that align LCM2000 categories with BHs and specify the variants that are displayed in map colours.

## Key content in Tables 5–8 (habitat coverage, comparisons, and correspondences)

- Table 5: Coverage (km2) of Subclasses from LCM2000 and Aggregate classes from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) across the UK and constituent countries.
  - Examples of UK totals (LCM2000): 
    - Broad-leaved/mixed woodland: 15,600 km2
    - Coniferous woodland: 13,540 km2
    - Arable & Horticulture: 57,630 km2
    - Improved grassland: 59,073 km2
    - Neutral grassland: 12,512 km2
    - Calcareous grassland: 11,107 km2
    - Acid grass: 15,793 km2
    - Bracken: 1,892 km2
    - Fen/marsh/swamp: 197 km2
    - Bog: 5,134 km2
    - Standing open water & canals: 2,095 km2
    - Built up areas & gardens: 16,132 km2
  - FS (field survey) values are often unavailable or incomplete for many classes; where provided they are lower or higher bounds relative to LCM2000, reflecting differences in data sources and definitions.
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tides and offshore areas considered/excluded.
- Table 6: LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) for BHs vs field survey estimates at 95% confidence (±2 standard errors) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and GB.
  - Examples (GB totals):
    - Broadleaved, mixed and yew woodland: LCM2000 = 15,259 km2; FS 95% CI Low = 12,750; High = 16,670
    - Coniferous woodland: LCM2000 = 12,879; FS Low = 10,672; High = 16,808
    - Arable & horticulture: LCM2000 = 56,638; FS Low = 47,944; High = 57,036
    - Improved grassland: LCM2000 = 50,024; FS Low = 50,536; High = 59,104
    - Neutral grassland: LCM2000 = 10,770; FS Low = 5,046; High = 7,214
    - Calcareous grassland: LCM2000 = 10,647; FS Low = 72; High = 1,228
    - Acid grassland: LCM2000 = 14,483; FS Low = 10,594; High = 15,306
    - Bracken: LCM2000 = 1,892; FS Low = 3,258; High = 5,522
    - Fen, marsh and swamp: LCM2000 = 197; FS Low = 4,138; High = 6,802
    - Bog: LCM2000 = 5,134; FS Low = 18,696; High = 25,664
    - Standing open water & canals: LCM2000 = 2,095; FS Low = 790; High = 3,010
    - Montane habitats: LCM2000 = 4,971; FS Low = -128; High = 1,108
    - Inland rock: LCM2000 = 2,163; FS Low = 324; High = 796
    - Built up areas & gardens: LCM2000 = 16,132; FS Low = 11,028; High = 15,592
    - Littoral rock: LCM2000 = 55; FS Low = 440; High = 2,320
- Table 8 and Table 9: Summary correspondence matrices (results per 1000) comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field squares in Great Britain and England & Wales.
  - These matrices show broad correspondence at the level of BHs and at the Target Class and Aggregate class levels.
  - They indicate general patterns of agreement but also highlight substantial variability and the influence of generalisation, especially for urban areas.
- Table 10: Summary correspondence matrix (per 1000) for Scotland, with similar patterns of cross-walk between LCM2000 and CS2000 at multiple taxonomic levels, including urban generalisation effects.

## Footnotes and methodological notes

- LCM2000 statistics come from a full count of cover on a 25 m grid; FS statistics come from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
- Differences between LCM2000 and FS are explained in the text; coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore intertidal areas.
- Total coverage differs by definition of the FS population (e.g., some BHs excluded in Northern Ireland).
- The tables incorporate a range of habitat groups across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with country-level and UK-wide totals.
- Certain FS estimates may be negative or NA due to bootstrapping and data limitations; some tables contain partial or missing values where data are not available.

## Implications for analysts and key takeaways

- LCM2000 provides a broad, grid-based UK-wide habitat map that can be cross-walked to CS2000 field-survey categories, but there are notable discrepancies in area estimates by habitat type.
- Woodland and arable/horticulture classes tend to show stronger correspondence between LCM2000 and FS estimates, but other habitat types (e.g., calcareous/ fen/marsh/swamp, bog) show substantial divergence and larger confidence intervals.
- Urban and built-up categories require careful handling due to generalisation effects and differences in how urban areas are captured in digitised maps versus field surveys.
- When using LCM2000 for practical decisions, incorporate the confidence intervals from CS2000 comparisons, be mindful of scale and definition differences, and consider calibrating LCM2000 against FS data where possible.
- For holistic planning, combine these data sources to improve understanding of habitat distribution, but be transparent about data limitations, coastal boundaries, and scale-related uncertainties.
