# Nutritive data for floodplain meadow hay collected on 4 sites in central England

## Overview
- Dataset from Vicky Bowskill as part of PhD research at The Open University; funded by NERC CENTA2 (NE/S007350/1).
- Linked method publications available via DOIs provided in the description.
- Contains 1 CSV file with nutritive data for floodplain meadow hay across multiple sites and years.

## Data structure and sampling design
- Structure: Columns are variables; rows are records.
- Sites: 3; Years: 2.
- Samples per site: 6; Replicates per sample: 2.
- Each data point represents the mean of two replicates.
- In Year 2, samples were bulled pairwise to reduce sampling costs.

## Measured variables and methods
- Nutritive metrics (CP, ME, ADF, NDF) derived from Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).
- Elemental nutrients (P, B, Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Se, S, Zn) measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES).
- Iodine (I) derived via Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS).

## Data labels and shorthand
- GDD: Accumulated Growing Degree-days (thermal time)
- AET: Accumulated Actual Evapotranspiration
- GFratio: Graminoid:Forb ratio
- CP: Crude Protein
- ME: Metabolisable Energy
- ADF: Acid Digestible Fibre
- NDF: Neutral Digestible Fibre

## Units and data types
- gm2: grams per square metre
- gkg: grams per kilogram
- mgkg: milligrams per kilogram
- percent: percent content
- offtake: offtake calculated as (% * yield) / 100
- Mjkg: MegaJoules per kilogram

## Data accessibility and provenance
- File type: 1 CSV file
- Data collection and lab methods are described, with connecting publications available via DOIs.

## Potential uses and guidance for reuse
- Suitable for forage nutritive analysis and cross-site comparisons across two years.
- Useful for exploring relationships between nutritive traits and environmental variables (GDD, AET, GFratio).
- When reusing, account for Year 2 bulking and replicates averaging; ensure consistent lab method contexts (NIRS, ICP-OES, ICP-MS).
