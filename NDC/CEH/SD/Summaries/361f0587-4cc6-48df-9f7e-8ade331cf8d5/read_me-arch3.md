# Data collected by Vicky Bowskill (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0293-327X) as part of PhD research with School of Environment, Earth and Ecosystem Sciences, Faculty of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, The Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA

## Overview and aims
- Nutritive data for floodplain meadow hay collected as part of a PhD project.
- Study conducted at multiple sites in central England; reported site count shows 3 in the structured data, with 4 sites noted in the descriptive label.
- Temporal coverage spans 2 years.
- Data provided as 1 CSV file containing variables (columns) and records (rows).

## Data structure and content
- Structure: Columns = variables; Rows = records.
- Sites: 3 (as per structure) with 2 years of data.
- Sampling design: 6 samples per site; each sample with 2 replicates; year 2 samples bulked pairwise to reduce costs.
- Replicates: 2 per sample; reported as the mean of two replicates.
- Data labels and terms:
  - Growth and environmental descriptors: GDD (Accumulated Growing Degree-days), AET (Accumulated Actual Evapotranspiration), GFratio (Graminoid:Forb ratio).
  - Nutritive metrics: CP (Crude Protein), ME (Metabolisable Energy), ADF (Acid Digestible Fibre), NDF (Neutral Digestible Fibre).
- Units:
  - gm2 (grams per square metre)
  - gkg (grams per kilogram)
  - mgkg (milligrams per kilogram)
  - percent
  - offtake (calculated as % × yield / 100)
  - Mjkg (MegaJoules per kilogram)

## Measurements and laboratory methods
- CP, ME, ADF, NDF derived via Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).
- P, B, Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Se, S, Zn measured via Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES).
- I (Iodine) measured via Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS).

## Metadata, provenance, and data quality
- Data provenance: Collected by Vicky Bowskill; linked to PhD research at The Open University; funded by NERC CENTA2.
- Documentation: Data labels and units explicitly defined; lab methods clearly stated; replicated measurements averaged to yield data points.
- Metadata completeness: Core metadata provided (sites, years, sampling design, methods, units, labels); potential gaps include detailed site descriptors, data governance specifics, and access conditions.
- Data sharing and governance considerations: Acknowledges that publicly sharing datasets can be a barrier; linked publications and identifiers provided to support traceability and reuse.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a structured approach to environmental health monitoring data: clear provenance, defined measurements, standardized units, and documented analytical methods.
- Provides derived indicators (GDD, AET, GFratio) alongside nutritive metrics (CP, ME, ADF, NDF) that can inform policy evaluation, land-management decisions, and ecosystem service assessments related to floodplain meadows.
- Highlights governance considerations for monitoring data: metadata clarity, data transformations, replicates, and the balance between data openness and sharing barriers.
