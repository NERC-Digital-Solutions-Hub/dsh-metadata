## Overview
- Nutritive data for floodplain meadow hay collected on 4 sites in central England.
- Part of a PhD project at The Open University; funded by NERC CENTA2 grant NE/S007350/1.
- Linked publications include full method descriptions (DOIs provided).
- Delivered as 1 CSV file.

## Data scope and structure
- Structure: Columns = variables; Rows = records.
- Sites: 3 (note: data description mentions 4 sites in central England).
- Years: 2.
- Samples per site: 6 (bulked pairwise in year 2 to reduce sampling costs).
- Replicates per sample: 2 (data point is the mean of two replicates).
- Data content: nutritive measurements for floodplain meadow hay.

## Lab methods and measurements
- Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) used for:
  - CP (Crude Protein)
  - ME (Metabolisable Energy)
  - ADF (Acid Digestible Fibre)
  - NDF (Neutral Digestible Fibre)
- ICP-OES used for:
  - P, B, Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Se, S, Zn
- ICP-MS used for:
  - I (Iodine)
- All measurements are linked to standard data labels described below.

## Data labels and units
- Examples of labels and meanings:
  - GDD: Accumulated Growing Degree-days (thermal time)
  - AET: Accumulated Actual Evapotranspiration
  - GFratio: Graminoid:Forb ratio
  - CP: Crude Protein
  - ME: Metabolisable Energy
  - ADF: Acid Digestible Fibre
  - NDF: Neutral Digestible Fibre
- Units:
  - gm2: grams per metre square
  - gkg: grams per kilogram
  - mgkg: milligram per kilogram
  - percent: percent content
  - offtake: calculated as (% of nutrient content) × yield / 100
  - Mjkg: MegaJoules per kilogram

## Data file access and related publications

## Notes for GIS applications
- Data are suitable for map-based visualization of spatially referenced nutritive properties (sites and years).
- Potential uses include spatial comparison of forage nutritive metrics across sites, temporal changes between years, and correlation with environmental covariates (e.g., GDD, AET).
