# Supporting documentation on the patch-discovery experiment

## Overview
- Location: Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK (51°46′N, 1°20′W)
- Species studied: great tits (Parus major), blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), marsh tits (Poecile palustris)
- Timeframe: January to March 2021
- Objective: investigate how changes in local population density influence the discovery of a novel resource by PIT-tagged birds
- Experimental setup: a novel food patch created by adding a new feeder next to two existing feeders (approximately 40 m away) at experimental and control sites

## Experimental design and procedures
- Density manipulation: conducted to assess its effect on patch discovery
- Patch-discovery setup: novel feeders placed in opposite directions at each site; a second patch-discovery experiment used different locations during density manipulation
- Feeder characteristics: novel feeders provide sunflower seeds; designed to be accessible to all PIT-tagged birds; identical design to existing feeders to avoid neophobia effects
- Placement timing: the day before the experiment after sunset or on the day of the experiment before sunrise
- Experiment duration per patch: feeders in place for one day

## Data collection and identifiers
- Bird capture methods: mist-nets in winter; nestboxes in spring
- Tagging: birds fitted with a unique metal leg-ring (BTO) and a plastic leg-ring with an inbuilt PIT tag
- Data collectors: Keith McMahon, Sam Croft, Kristina Beck
- Dataset scope: records the date, time, and logger (novel feeder) of each individual's visit
- Site and species information: includes experimental site identity (Site) and species code (Bto.species.code; greti = great tit, bluti = blue tit, marti = marsh tit)

## Data content and structure
- File format: a single CSV file
- Columns include: date, time, logger (novel feeder), Bto.ring (individual identity), Site, Bto.species.code
- Species codes: greti, bluti, marti

## Data management and accessibility
- The document documents data collection and the dataset composition, but explicit data storage, formatting standards, or portal submission steps are not detailed beyond the CSV structure and contributor information
