# Supporting documentation on the patch-discovery experiment

## Objective and context
- Investigates how changes in local population density influence the discovery of a novel resource by birds.
- Location: Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK (51°46′N, 1°20′W).
- Study species: great tits (Parus major), blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), marsh tits (Poecile palustris).
- Timeframe: January–March 2021, as part of experimental manipulation of local population density.

## Experimental design
- Density manipulation: conducted to alter local bird density and assess its effect on patch discovery.
- Patch-discovery setup: a new feeder placed near two existing feeders (approximately 40 m apart; novel feeders opposite directions within each site).
- Second patch-discovery experiment: different locations chosen during the density manipulation period.
- Food provided: sunflower seeds; feeders programmed to allow access to all PIT-tagged birds.
- Patch-discovery metric: time and order in which individuals discovered the novel food patch.
- Timing of installation: novel feeders placed the day before the experiment after sunset or on the day of the experiment before sunrise.
- Duration of each patch-discovery setup: novel feeders remained in place for one day.

## Tagging and data collection
- Bird capture and tagging: birds captured winter via mist-nets or spring in nestboxes; fitted with a unique metal leg-ring (BTO) and a plastic leg-ring with a PIT tag.
- Data collectors for this study: Keith McMahon, Sam Croft, and Kristina Beck.
- Reference context: part of a broader study described in Savill et al. 2011 (Wytham Woods: Oxford's ecological laboratory).

## Dataset details
- Data format: a single CSV file.
- Key variables:
  - Date and time of each individual’s visit to a novel feeder.
  - Logger identifier (novel feeder).
  - Site identifier (experimental site).
  - Species identity (Bto.species.code; greti = great tit, bluti = blue tit, marti = marsh tit).
  - Individual identity (Bto.ring; unique ring number).
- Purpose of the dataset: to analyze the sequence and timing of patch-discovery events across individuals, species, and sites in relation to density treatment.

## Additional notes
- This documentation references the broader experimental context: density manipulation and its effects on resource patch discovery.
