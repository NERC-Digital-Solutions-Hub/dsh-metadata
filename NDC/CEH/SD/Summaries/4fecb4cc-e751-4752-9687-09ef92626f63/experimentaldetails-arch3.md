# Purpose of study
- This study represents a preliminary investigation on the interaction between turbulence and biofilms, using particle image velocimetry (PIV) to provide spatially- and temporally-resolved velocity vector fields in water for different flow configurations.

## Channel design
- A purpose-built flow facility with four sections: flow conditioner, developing section, test section, and diffuser.
- Flow conditioner features a 4.8 mm thick perforated plastic sheet (4.8 mm holes, 32% open area) and three screens 2.5 cm apart to reduce incoming turbulence; includes a two-dimensional contraction with inlet-to-outlet height ratio of 8:1.
- Developing section is 1 m long to ensure fully developed flow in the ensuing 50 cm test section; side and top walls are fitted with float glass windows for optical access.
- Permeable bed consists of a regular array of acrylic rods spanning the channel width, spanning both the developing and test sections (each 30 cm long).
- Two porosity levels (approximately 35% and 45%) are achieved by using 6.3 mm (1/4") rods for higher porosity and adding central 3.2 mm (1/8") rods to reduce porosity by ~10%.
- Flow rate controlled by pump frequency; flow measured with a SeaMetrics insertion electromagnetic flow meter on a 1.5" PVC pipe.

## PIV setup
- A dual-head, pulsed Evergreen Nd:YAG laser (max energy 200 mJ/pulse) creates a ~1 mm-thick laser sheet illuminating the seeding particles in the x-y plane.
- Imaging performed with a 16-bit, 5.5-megapixel camera (2560 × 2160) with 6.5 μm pixels, coupled to a Navitar long-distance microscope (NA ~0.012) and a zoom lens set at ~2×; field of view is ~18 × 15 mm².
- Biofilm is developed on a 30 cm long permeable bed section, then placed in the test section for flow experiments.
- Flow rate varied via a variable frequency drive; data recorded at four pump frequencies.

## Boundary conditions and experimental design
- Seventeen different experiments conducted (labeled 1–17), each differing in biofilm presence (Y/N), pump frequency, and bed porosity.
- Experimental configurations span combinations of biofilm presence (y/n), pump frequencies (e.g., 4.5, 8, 16, 30 Hz), and bed porosities (35% and 45%), with some runs indicating porosity changes between developing and test sections (e.g., 45% developing / 35% test).

## Measured variables
- Y: distance from the top of the cylinder.
- U: mean streamwise velocity.
- V: mean wall-normal velocity.
- u', v': fluctuating velocity components; u'u', u'v', v'v' represent Reynolds stresses.
- Omega: mean vorticity.
- omega_rms: root mean square of vorticity fluctuations.
- Lci: mean swirling strength.
- lci_rms: root mean square of fluctuating swirling strength.
