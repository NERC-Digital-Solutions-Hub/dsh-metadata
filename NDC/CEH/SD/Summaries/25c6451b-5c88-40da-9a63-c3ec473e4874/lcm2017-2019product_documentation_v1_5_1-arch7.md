# The UKCEH Land Cover Maps for 2017, 2018 and 2019 v1.5.1

## Purpose and scope
- Release of three new UKCEH land cover maps: LCM2017, LCM2018, and LCM2019.
- Each map comprises a range of geospatial datasets mapped to 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats) aligned with LCM2015.
- Data produced automatically using Bootstrap Training with a Random Forest classifier; aim to deliver UK-wide maps annually.
- Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images (TOA reflectance) per season underpin classification; a set of 10 Context Layers enhances spectral separation.
- Before this release, significant manual corrections were avoided to enable annual production; visual checks and formal validation were conducted and indicate similar quality to LCM2015.
- Terminology and class relationships clarified; glossary and appendices provided to aid interpretation and cross-walking with BAP Broad Habitats.

## Product structure and class relationships
- 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (mapped from BAP Broad Habitats; near one-to-one with UKCEH classes in several cases; some refinements exist to improve detection with remote sensing).
- For users needing generalized outputs, UKCEH Aggregate Classes are also provided (relationship table described in Appendices).
- Data formats and extents are provided in GB (Great Britain) and NI (Northern Ireland) versions, each with year-specific datasets.

## Datasets and data products
- Total datasets per year: 42 (GB and NI across 2017, 2018, 2019).
- 20m Classified Pixels (new in these LCMs)
  - Pixel-level RF classification results from 20m Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images.
  - Band 1 = most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class; Band 2 = confidence (0–100) for the nominated class.
  - 20m data preserve fine detail (e.g., narrow features) and are not generalised by the Land Parcel framework.
- Land Parcels
  - Generated by intersecting the 20m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - Attributes (examples): gid, hist (per-class pixel counts), mode (dominant class), purity (modal fraction, 0–100), conf (mean class membership probability 0–100), stdev, n (total pixels).
  - Some attribute names differ from LCM2015 to align with production software conventions.
  - Parcels reflect a minimum mapping unit of ~0.5 ha; designed to provide stable, discrete units for change detection and analysis.
- 25m Rasterised Land Parcels
  - Rasterised from Land Parcels to 25m pixels; 3 bands: band 1 = _mode, band 2 = _conf, band 3 = _purity.
  - Provides a higher-level summary suitable for many analyses while maintaining parcel-derived context.
- 1km Raster datasets
  - 1km Percent Cover: 21-band raster (per 1km cell, percentage cover of each UKCEH Class).
  - 1km Percent Aggregate Cover: 10-band raster (percentage by UKCEH Aggregate Class).
  - 1km Dominant Cover: single-band raster (dominant UKCEH Class per 1km cell).
  - 1km Dominant Aggregate Cover: single-band raster (dominant UKCEH Aggregate Class per 1km cell).
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Derived from Google Earth Engine; four-season (winter, spring, summer, autumn) median TOA reflectance of 9 Sentinel-2 bands at 20m.
  - Some seasonal gaps may occur due to cloud; classifier designed to tolerate partial data. Future work may include SAR or alternative optical sources to fill gaps.
- Context Rasters (20m)
  - Include terrain (Height, Aspect, Slope) and proximity indicators (distance to buildings, roads, sea, freshwater; foreshore and tidal masks; woodland mask) to reduce spectral confusion.
  - Separate context rasters provided for GB and NI to reflect data availability.
- Classification Scenes and tiling
  - GB: 74 overlapping 100x100 km tiles used to source 36-band Seasonal Composite Images; combined with 46-band GB Classification Scenes (36 spectral bands + 10 context layers).
  - NI: a single 43-band Classification Scene per year (36 spectral + 7 context) covering the minimum bounding rectangle of NI land mass.
  - Each Classification Scene is trained and classified independently; overlaps are resolved by visual inspection to select the best results for the final product.

## UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
- The framework used for LCM2017–2019 is a refined version of the LCM2015 framework.
- Parcel geometry matches LCM2015, but storage order and indices were updated to improve processing speed. gid values do not match LCM2015 parcel identifiers.
- MMU remains ~0.5 ha; parcels represent discrete land units and facilitate temporal comparisons, though the framework is open to alternative parcel structures from users.

## Bootstrap Training and Random Forest classification
- Bootstrap Training: automatic, self-starting training data derived from historic LCMs (primarily LCM2015), enabling rapid map production without fresh field data.
- Training data for 2017–2019 derive from 2015 parcels with high purity (>= 99%), enabling a majority-signal approach for upcoming maps (future releases anticipate using multi-year majority signals).
- Random Forest classifier: 10,000 samples per class, balanced to ensure rare classes are learned adequately.
- Production software integrates Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL (open-source tools).

## Validation and quality
- Validation conducted using UK-scale comparisons to GB countryside survey data (2019), National Forest Inventory data, IACS data, and bespoke LCM validation points (n ≈ 22,325).
- Reported overall accuracy (AC) at the UK scale:
  - LCM2017: 78.6%
  - LCM2018: 79.6%
  - LCM2019: 79.4%
- Note: Validation data share the same source pool across years; some class mappings required transformation; results reflect best available indicators rather than absolute truth. Expect improvements as methods mature.

## Practical considerations for GIS specialists
- 21 Land Cover Classes are used across products; outputs are available at 20m (classified pixels), 25m (land parcels), and 1km (percent/cover/dominant) scales.
- Coordinate systems:
  - GB: British National Grid (EPSG: 27700)
  - NI: Irish National Grid (EPSG: 29903)
- Outputs are provided per year and per region (GB, NI) with explicit notes on parcel gid changes relative to prior products.
- Visualisation guidance and class colour ramps provided in appendices; dataset descriptions illustrate how to interpret per-pixel classifications, parcel histograms, and confidence metrics.

## Data access and future directions
- The 2017–2019 LCM suite provides 42 datasets (GB and NI, each year), enabling cross-year comparability with caveats on parcel identifiers.
- Plans indicate continued annual releases (LCM2020/2021 trajectory) and ongoing evaluation of input data (e.g., exploring Sentinel-1 SAR, alternative optical sources) to improve completeness and accuracy.
- Continued refinement of bootstrap strategies and potential use of multi-year majority signals to stabilize training data for future maps.

## Summary of end-user implications
- GIS analysts can rely on automatically produced, year-on-year UK-wide land cover maps with clearly defined datasets at multiple resolutions.
- The 20m Classified Pixels output preserves fine-scale features; Land Parcels provide a robust framework for change detection and temporal analyses; 1km rasters enable efficient thematic mapping and broad-scale assessments.
- Users should be aware of mismatches in parcel identifiers across years when linking to LCM2015 or other historical products, and of the single-year validation snapshot used for all three products.
