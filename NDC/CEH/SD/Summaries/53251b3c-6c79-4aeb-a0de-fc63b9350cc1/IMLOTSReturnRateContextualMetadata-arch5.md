# The dataset:

## Overview
- Dataset of calculated annual return rates for five seabird species at the Isle of May, Scotland.
- Return rates are the proportion of colour-marked birds seen in a given year that were also observed in the previous year.
- Not a survival estimate; rows represent years, with five RR columns and additional counts per year.

## Data content and structure
- One row per year.
- Five columns: return rate (RR) for each species (common name with suffix RR).
- Additional columns: number of individuals seen in the year and number seen in the previous year (includes newly marked individuals).
- Interpretation note: the reported figure is the proportion observed by the end of the breeding season; not all individuals are seen every year.

## Species and monitoring details
- Species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake.
- Monitoring history: standardised seabird monitoring since 1987; first return-rate year 1988 after colour marking.
- Marking scheme: puffins marked at a single plot; guillemots at five plots; razorbills at four plots; kittiwakes at seven plots (two plots later became inactive due to decline; a new plot added in 2013); shags marked at one plot until 2005, then two more plots added.
- Field procedures: daily visits to colour-marked plots during the first four weeks of fieldwork (mid-April); nest-site checks to identify breeding pairs; ongoing searches for colour-marked birds beyond peak period due to possible movement between plots.

## Data collection and quality assurance
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced staff using predefined protocols; data recorded in notebooks and field data sheets.
- Data transcribed to spreadsheets; backups stored in CEH directories; notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Databases quality-controlled at source with error-checking queries to validate field data.

## Data governance, access, and sharing
- Deliverables and reporting vetted through CEH management (Heads of Sections, Programme Directors, Finance Administration).
- Encouragement to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature, with prior approval from customers and acknowledgement.
- Licence: free to use under the standard CEH data licence; researchers are encouraged to contact CEH staff before using the dataset, especially for publication.

## Provenance and context
- Originates from the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), part of the UK JNCC national seabird monitoring programme.
- Standardised monitoring began in 1987; return-rate analysis started in 1988.
- Data handling includes year-by-year updates of marked individuals to keep the marked population adequate for analysis.

## Considerations for data stewards
- Metadata should capture species, site, time period, RR definitions, units, and plot details; note about not treating RR as survival.
- Document any changes in plots over time and their potential impact on time-series analyses (e.g., added/removed plots, island population declines).
- Ensure clear guidance on data use restrictions, citation, and the requirement to contact CEH staff prior to publication.

## Related programme context
- Part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study and broader JNCC seabird monitoring program.
- Data handling and dissemination are aligned with CEH’s data governance and publication policies.
