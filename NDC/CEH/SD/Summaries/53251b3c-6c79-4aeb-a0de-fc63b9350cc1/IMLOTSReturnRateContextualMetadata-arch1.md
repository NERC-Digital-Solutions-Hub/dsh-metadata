# The dataset

- A long-term, representative dataset of calculated return rates for five seabird species at Isle of May, Scotland.
- Annual return rates are the proportion of colour-marked individuals seen in a given year that were observed in the previous year; not survival estimates because not all individuals are seen every year.
- Each year is one row; there are five columns of return rates (one per species, labeled by common name with the suffix 'RR').
- Each row also records the number of individuals seen that year and in the previous year, accounting for new marked individuals.

- Species and marking details:
  - Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, and black-legged kittiwake.
  - Marking started in 1987; first return-rate data available for 1988.
  - Number of colour-marked plots varies by species; new individuals are marked each year to maintain a usable marked population.
  - Puffins: monitored at a single plot (>100 marked birds). Guillemots: five plots. Razorbills: four plots. Kittiwakes: seven plots (two plots later became empty as the population declined; a new plot added in 2013). Shags: one large plot until 2005, then two additional plots added due to decline.
  - For shags, razorbills, and guillemots, nest sites are checked until all breeding pairs are identified, whether colour-marked or not.

- Field and sampling methods:
  - Colour-marked birds are observed through daily visits during the first four weeks of fieldwork (mid-April).
  - Regular searches for colour-marked individuals occur throughout the rest of the breeding season; nest site checks aim to identify all breeding pairs.

- Data handling and quality control:
  - Fieldwork performed by trained staff following defined protocols; data collected in notebooks/field sheets and transcribed to spreadsheets.
  - Data backups maintained; notebooks/fieldsheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases are quality-controlled at source with error-checking queries to verify uncertain information.

- Licensing and publication:
  - Data are free to use under a standard CEH data licence.
  - Authors encourage contacting CEH staff before publication, especially for publications.

- Output, governance, and dissemination:
  - Data integrity, report quality, alignment with contracted deliverables, and reporting timeliness are vetted by CEH management.
  - CEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed outlets with customer prior approval and acknowledgement.

- Background and context:
  - Seabird studies at Isle of May NNR started in 1973 as part of IMLOTS, within JNCC’s national seabird monitoring program.
  - Standardised seabird monitoring began in 1987; the Isle of May Long-Term Study maintains marking and monitoring across plots to support analysis.
