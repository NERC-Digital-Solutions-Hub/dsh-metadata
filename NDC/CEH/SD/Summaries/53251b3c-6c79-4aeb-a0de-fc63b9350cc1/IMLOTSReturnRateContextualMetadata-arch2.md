# The dataset:

- A dataset of calculated return rates for five seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies off the East coast of Scotland.
- Annual return rates are defined as the proportion of colour-marked individuals seen in a given year that were also observed in the previous year; not all marked birds are seen each year, so these are not survival estimates.
- Each year is a single row with five columns for the species (each suffixed 'RR'); rows also include the number of individuals seen in that year and in the previous year, accounting for new marked individuals.
- The dataset is free to use under a standard CEH data licence; authors encourage contacting CEH staff before publication or use. 

## Background

- Seabird studies on the Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR) began in 1973 as part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), within the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee's (JNCC) national seabird monitoring programme.
- Standardised seabird monitoring began in 1987 with colour marking of a portion of the population; first return-rate data appeared in 1988.
- The number of colour-marked plots varies by species; new individuals are marked annually to maintain a suitable marked population for analysis.

## Species and marking details

- Puffin (Fratercula arctica): colour marked at a single plot with over 100 marked birds.
- Guillemot (Uria aalge): colour ringed at five plots.
- Razorbill (Alca torda): colour ringed at four plots.
- Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla): colour ringed at seven plots; overall island population is in decline, leading to a new plot in 2013 as some plots ceased to contain birds.
- Shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis): colour marked at one large plot until 2005, then two additional plots added in response to a large population decline.
- Colour-marked plots are visited daily during the first four weeks of fieldwork (mid-April); for shags, razorbills, and guillemots nest sites are checked until all breeding pairs are identified, whether colour-marked or unringed.
- While seabirds show site fidelity, occasional movements between plots occur, so colour-marked birds are searched for regularly across the Isle of May colony.

## Field measurements and handling

- Fieldwork, sampling, and data handling conducted by trained staff following defined protocols aligned with study objectives.
- Data collected in notebooks and field sheets, transcribed to spreadsheets, and backed up to CEH directories; notebooks and fieldsheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.

## Databases and quality assurance

- All databases were quality controlled at the source.
- Access databases include error-checking queries to validate uncertain information at the field station and correct errors.

## Output, governance, and publication

- Data integrity, report quality, alignment with contracted deliverables, and reporting punctuality are vetted and tracked within CEH by management (Heads of Sections, Programme Directors, and Finance Administration).
- All CEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature, with prior customer approval and acknowledgement.

## Licensing, access, and practical use

- The dataset is free to use under CEH’s standard data licence.
- Researchers are encouraged to contact CEH staff beforehand, particularly if using the data for publication.

## Key challenges and opportunities for analysts

- Increasing the value of the datasets by combining them with other relevant data (to avoid single-use).
- Enabling others to access the underlying data used to create final outputs.
