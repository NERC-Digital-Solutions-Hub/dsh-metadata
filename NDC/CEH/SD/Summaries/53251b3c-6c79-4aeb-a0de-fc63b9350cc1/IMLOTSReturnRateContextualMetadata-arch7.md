# The dataset:

- What it is
  - A dataset of calculated return rates for five seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies off the East coast of Scotland.
  - Annual return rates are the proportion of colour-marked individuals seen in a given year that were also observed in the previous year; not survival estimates.
  - Each year is a single row; five columns hold the calculated return rates for each species (located by common name and suffixed with 'RR').
  - Each row also includes the number of individuals seen that year and in the previous year, including new marked individuals.

- Species and monitoring details
  - Species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, and black-legged kittiwake.
  - Colour marking and monitoring schemes vary by species; data collected from representative plots on Isle of May.
  - Colour-marked plots and the number of plots per species: puffins (one plot, >100 marked birds); guillemots (five plots); razorbill (four plots); kittiwakes (seven plots, with added plot in 2013 due to population changes); shags (one large plot initially, later expanded).

- Spatial and temporal coverage
  - Field collection began in 1987 (return-rate data starts in 1988).
  - Monitoring occurs at multiple plots per species with annual updates; plots may be added or changed over time (e.g., kittiwake plot addition in 2013; shag plots expanded in 2005).
  - Although seabirds are site-faithful, individuals can move between plots; colour-marked birds are regularly searched for across the Isle of May colony.

- Data structure and handling
  - Field data collected by experienced staff using defined protocols; notebooks and field data sheets; later transcribed to spreadsheets.
  - Data backed up to CEH directories and archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases used are quality-controlled at source; access databases include error-checking queries to verify information.

- Licensing, use, and publication
  - Data are free to use under a CEH data licence.
  - Authors encourage contacting CEH staff before publication, especially for publications using the dataset.
  - CEH governance ensures data integrity, quality of reports, and alignment with contracted deliverables; staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information with customer approval.

- Context and background
  - Part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) within the UK JNCC national seabird monitoring programme.
  - Standards established in 1987; first return-rate year 1988; ongoing maintenance of marked populations through annual marking.
  - Field procedures include daily visits during the first four weeks of fieldwork and comprehensive nest-site checks for certain species to identify breeding pairs.
