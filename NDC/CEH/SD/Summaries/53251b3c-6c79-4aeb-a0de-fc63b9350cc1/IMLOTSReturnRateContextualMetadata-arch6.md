# The dataset:

- A dataset of calculated return rates for five seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies off Scotland: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, and black-legged kittiwake.
- Annual return rates are defined as the proportion of colour-marked individuals seen in a given year that were also observed in the previous year; not a survival estimate.
- Each year is a single row with five columns for return rates (one per species, labeled by common name with suffix 'RR').
- Each row also includes: (i) the number of individuals seen in that year, and (ii) the number seen in the previous year, including new individuals marked that year.

- Access and licensing: Free to use, subject to a standard CEH data licence; authors encourage contacting CEH staff before publication. 

- Background context: Collected as part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), linked to UK JNCC seabird monitoring; standardised monitoring began in 1987 with annual return-rate data starting in 1988.

- Field data collection details:
  - Species-specific marking plots: puffins at one plot (>100 marked), guillemots at five plots, razorbill at four plots, kittiwakes at seven plots (though some plots may be empty due to declines), shags at one plot until 2005 then added plots due to population changes.
  - Colour-marked plots are visited daily during the first four weeks of fieldwork (mid-April); nest-site checks are conducted to identify breeding pairs, including unringed birds.
  - Although seabirds are site-faithful, individuals may move between plots; marked birds are searched for regularly throughout the Isle of May colony after initial checks.

- Data handling and quality:
  - Fieldwork and data handling follow defined protocols; data collected in notebooks and field sheets, transcribed to spreadsheets, and archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases are quality-controlled with error-checking queries to verify data at the field station.

- Output and dissemination:
  - CEH management vetting ensures data integrity, alignment with contracted deliverables, and timely reporting.
  - CEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature, with client approval and acknowledgment.
