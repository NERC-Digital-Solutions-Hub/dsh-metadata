# The dataset:

## Overview
- A dataset of calculated return rates for five seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies off Scotland.
- Return rate defined as the proportion of colour-marked birds observed in a given year that were also observed in the previous year; not a survival estimate since not all individuals are seen every year.
- Each year is a single row; five columns provide return rates for Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, and black-legged kittiwake (RR suffix).
- Each row also includes counts of individuals seen in the year and in the previous year, including newly marked individuals.
- The dataset is free to use under a standard CEH data licence; users are encouraged to contact CEH staff before publication.

## Background and context
- Seabird studies at Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR) began in 1973 as part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), within the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) seabird monitoring programme.
- Standardised monitoring began in 1987; a portion of the population for the five species was colour marked, enabling the first return-rate year in 1988.
- Marking schemes and plots vary by species, with puffins monitored at a single plot, guillemots at five plots, razorbills at four plots, kittiwakes at seven plots (two plots later abandoned due to declines, with a new plot added in 2013), and shags at one plot initially, expanding to three plots after 2005.
- Colour-marked plots are visited intensively in mid-April; nest sites are checked for all species where applicable to identify breeding pairs.

## Field methods and data collection
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced staff following defined protocols aligned to study objectives.
- Data captured in notebooks and field datasheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets; backups stored in CEH directories.
- Notebooks and datasheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.

## Data management and quality control
- All databases are quality controlled at the source.
- Access databases include error-checking queries to verify information at the field station and correct errors.

## Output, governance, and dissemination
- Data integrity, report quality, alignment with contracted deliverables, and punctuality of reporting are vetted and tracked within CEH by management staff.
- CEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature, with prior customer approval and acknowledgement.

## Data access, licensing, and use
- Dataset is free to use under CEH licensing; authors encourage prior contact with CEH staff for publication-related use.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks (archetype considerations)
- Demonstrates long-term, species- and plot-specific monitoring with standardized methodologies and clear definitions of the measured metric (return rate).
- Highlights data provenance and governance: defined field protocols, archiving, quality control at source, and management vetting of outputs.
- Illustrates data sharing considerations: licensing, formal encouragement to contact data stewards, and need for approvals prior to dissemination.
- Addresses potential data limitations relevant to monitoring frameworks:
  - Return rate is not a survival estimate due to incomplete resighting.
  - Variation in plots over time (new plots added, some plots abandoned) requiring careful interpretation of trends.
  - Movement of individuals between plots and site fidelity issues that could affect consistency across years.
- Provides a structured example of how metadata, data handling, and publication workflows can be integrated into a monitoring framework to ensure data quality, transparency, and usability.
