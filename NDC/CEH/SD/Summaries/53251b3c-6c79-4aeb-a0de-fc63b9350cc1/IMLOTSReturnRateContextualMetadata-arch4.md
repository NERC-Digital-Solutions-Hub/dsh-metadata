# The dataset

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset of calculated return rates for five seabird species from Isle of May colonies off the East coast of Scotland.
  - Return rate defined as the proportion of colour-marked individuals observed in a given year that were also observed in the previous year.
  - Species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, and black-legged kittiwake.
  - Not all individuals are seen every year; the dataset does not provide survival estimates and may not account for long-term misses.

- Data structure
  - Each year is a single row.
  - Five columns for return rates (labeled by common name suffixed with 'RR').
  - Additional fields include the number of individuals seen in the year and in the previous year, including newly marked birds.
  - All data are free to use under a standard CEH data licence; authors encourage contacting CEH staff before publication.

- Background and context
  - Part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), linked to the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) seabird monitoring programme.
  - Standardised monitoring began in 1987; return rate data start in 1988.
  - Marking: Puffins marked at a single plot (>100 birds); guillemots at five plots; razorbills at four plots; kittiwakes at seven plots (with one additional plot added in 2013 due to population decline); shags marked at one large plot until 2005 when two more plots were added.
  - Plot-specific marking and monitoring schedules:
    - Colour-marked plots visited daily during the first four weeks of fieldwork (mid-April).
    - For shags, razorbills, and guillemots, nest sites checked until breeding pairs are identified (marked or unringed).
    - Site fidelity is high, but individuals may move between plots; colour-marked birds are searched for throughout the Isle of May colony.

- Data collection and processing
  - Fieldwork conducted by trained staff following defined protocols.
  - Data recorded in notebooks and field data sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets; backups stored in CEH directories.
  - Notebooks and data sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases used are quality-controlled at source; access databases include error-checking queries to validate uncertain information from the field.

- Data governance and output
  - Results, report quality, alignment with contracted deliverables, and timeliness are subject to management vetting within CEH.
  - CEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature, with customer approval and acknowledgement.
  - Data provenance and long-term stewardship align with CEH’s data management practices, supporting discoverability and re-use by the wider research community.
