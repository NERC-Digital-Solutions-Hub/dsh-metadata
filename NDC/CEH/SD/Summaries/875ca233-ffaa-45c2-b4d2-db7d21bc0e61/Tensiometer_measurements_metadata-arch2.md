# Tensiometer measurements from a field experiment in the Conwy valley, North Wales, UK (2013 - 2015)

## Overview
- Field experiment conducted 2013–2015 in Conwy valley, North Wales, UK.
- Purpose: capture soil water potential (tensiometer readings) to monitor environmental moisture conditions over time.

## Experimental design and sampling
- Tensiometers inserted vertically into holes bored with a hand auger.
- Locations chosen according to Plot_locations.csv.

## Instrumentation and collection methods
- Soil water potential measured with refillable Delta-T SWT4R tensiometers.
- Connected to a Delta-T logger.
- Internal conversion to centimetres of water within the logger.

## Data structure and units
- Recorded values are soil water potential in centimetres of water (cm H2O).
- Columns include DateTime and SWP measurements for each site/depth combination:
  - SWP_4.1_12.5, SWP_4.1_42.5, SWP_4.2_12.5, SWP_4.2_42.5, SWP_4.3_12.5, SWP_4.3_42.5, SWP_4.4_12.5, SWP_4.4_42.5.
- Empty cells indicate missing data.

## Metadata and supporting documents
- Plot_locations.csv contains site coordinates.
- Plot_locations_metadata.rtf contains metadata for Plot_locations.csv.

## Data quality and validation
- Quality control performed via visual inspection of plotted time series.

## Data management and accessibility
- Data are prepared for storage and uploading to appropriate data portals.
- Underlying site locations and coordinates are described in the associated metadata files.
