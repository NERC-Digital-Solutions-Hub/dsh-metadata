# Tensiometer measurements from a field experiment in the Conwy valley, North Wales, UK (2013 - 2015) Metadata for file Tensiometer_measurements.csv

## What the data are
- Field measurements of soil water potential (SWP) recorded as centimetres of water.
- Measurements collected over 2013–2015 at multiple site locations and depths.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Tensiometers inserted vertically into holes bored with a hand auger.
- Locations determined and listed in Plot_locations.csv.

## Collection methods and instruments
- Soil water potential measured with refillable Delta-T Devices SWT4R tensiometers.
- Tensiometers connected to a Delta-T logger.
- Internal logger calibration converts readings to centimetres of water.

## Data structure and variables
- Time-stamped measurements:
  - DateTime: date and time of measurement.
- Site and depth-specific variables:
  - SWP_4.1_12.5
  - SWP_4.1_42.5
  - SWP_4.2_12.5
  - SWP_4.2_42.5
  - SWP_4.3_12.5
  - SWP_4.3_42.5
  - SWP_4.4_12.5
  - SWP_4.4_42.5
- Data completeness: empty cells indicate no data.

## Data quality and provenance
- Quality control performed via visual inspection of plotted time series.
- Calibration steps include internal conversion to centimetres of water within the logger.

## Metadata, discoverability, and supporting documents
- Site coordinates are provided in Plot_locations.csv.
- Metadata for Plot_locations.csv is available in Plot_locations_metadata.rtf.
- Naming convention for data columns captures site and depth (e.g., SWP_Site_Depth).

## Data management and usage considerations
- Data assets are organized for format consistency, quality assessment, metadata, discoverability, and updates.
- Data gathering may involve commissioning new data and creative data collection approaches.
- Useful for cross-site/time-series analysis of soil water potential and for validating models or comparative studies across sites and depths.
