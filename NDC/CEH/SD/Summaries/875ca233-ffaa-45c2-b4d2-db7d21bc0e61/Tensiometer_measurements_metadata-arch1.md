# Tensiometer measurements from a field experiment in the Conwy valley, North Wales, UK (2013 - 2015) Metadata for file Tensiometer_measurements.csv

## Experimental design / Sampling regime
- Tensiometers inserted vertically into holes bored using a hand auger at locations listed in Plot_locations.csv.

## Collection Methods
- Soil water potential measured with refillable Delta-T Devices SWT4R tensiometers connected to a Delta-T logger.
- Internal conversion to centimetres of water within the logger.

## Fieldwork and Laboratory instrumentation
- See above (tensiometers and Delta-T logger).

## Calibration steps and values
- Internal conversion to centimetres of water within the logger.

## Nature and Units of recorded values
- Tensiometer measurements in centimetres (cm) of water.

## Quality Control
- Visual inspection of plotted time series.

## Miscellaneous supporting documents
- Coordinates of site locations available in Plot_locations.csv.
- Metadata for Plot_locations.csv contained in Plot_locations_metadata.rtf.
