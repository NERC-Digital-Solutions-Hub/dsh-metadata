# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteers to collect annual population data for butterflies across the UK since 1976, with over 2,500 active sites monitored each year.
  - Data support understanding of insect population changes and inform biodiversity policy questions.

- Sampling framework and data sources
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects at sites, 2–4 km, recorded weekly (up to 26 visits/year) from April to September; ~1,900 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year (min 2 in July/August; spring visits encouraged); ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or periods.

- Nature of data and indices
  - Data are used to create abundance indices (relative measures, not absolute counts) reflecting population trends.
  - Site indices are aggregated into species-level indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) methodology (2016) with weighting to reflect the proportion of the flight period surveyed per site/year.
  - All sampling methods are combined to produce seasonal counts and extrapolate gaps, with greater weight given to observed data.

- Data quality control and verification
  - Field data collected on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalous counts or records outside flight periods; regional transect coordinators and data validators perform ongoing QA.
  - Additional automated and manual validation screens for range, timing, first records, atypical abundances, and site-specific anomalies; data edits are made as needed.

- Data download: scope and structure
  - The download covers site location and attribute data for UK sites monitored from 1976 to 2020 (sensitive sites excluded).
  - Provided as a CSV file with columns including site number, site name, grid reference, easting/northing, transect length, country, number of sections, years surveyed, first/last year surveyed, and survey type (UKBMS vs WCBS).

- Licence and attribution
  - Open Government Licence (OGL) for reuse, with specific attribution requirements.
  - Citations and DOIs must be included in publications using the data; attribution text should acknowledge UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, JNCC.
  - Since 2017, submitters generally consent to OGL; however, historical data may have IP considerations; researchers should contact if needed.

- Collaboration and contact information
  - UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset use and interpretation, with opportunities for co-authorship or intellectual input in publications.
