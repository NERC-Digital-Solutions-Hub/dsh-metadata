# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Relies on volunteer data collection; monitors butterfly populations across the UK since 1976.
- Currently involves over 2,500 actively recorded sites per year.
- Data support policy-related biodiversity status and trends questions.

## Sampling framework
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m wide belt, recorded weekly (up to 26 visits/year) from early April to late September; ~1,900 sites sampled annually.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year (plus encouraged spring visits); ~800 squares per year.
- Targeted surveys: include single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or life stages.

## Nature of data and trend analysis
- Data are used to create abundance indices (relative measures, not absolute counts) for butterfly populations.
- Indices account for species detectability differences across sites.
- Overall species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a weighting adjustment that emphasizes recorded data proportional to the flight period surveyed each year.
- The approach combines counts from all methods to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps in recording, prioritizing observed data over extrapolated data.

## Quality control
- Field data collected on standard forms; entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag unusual counts or records outside known flight periods; regional transect coordinators validate data throughout the season.
- Multi-stage validation includes checks for: records outside known distribution, atypical abundances, records first-time at a site, and anomalies against site norms.
- Corrections are made via bespoke queries and coordination with coordinators or recorders.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates a large-scale, long-running data system with robust governance, data quality controls, and clear licensing for open reuse.
- Highlights approaches to managing spatially distributed time-series data, standardizing metadata, and ensuring data discoverability and reusability.
- Provides model for user collaboration, co-ownership of data products, and cross-organizational partnerships to support data-driven policy and biodiversity monitoring.
