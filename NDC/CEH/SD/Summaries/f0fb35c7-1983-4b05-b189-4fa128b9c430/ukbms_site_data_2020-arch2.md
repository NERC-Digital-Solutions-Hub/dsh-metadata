# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
  - It relies on volunteer data contributions and has monitored butterfly population changes across the UK since 1976, currently with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.
  - Data from all sampling methods are analyzed together to understand changes in insect populations and inform biodiversity policy questions.

- Monitoring framework and data types
  - Three main sampling components:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year) across habitat sections.
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits/year (minimum two in July/August; spring visits encouraged).
    - Targeted surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species.
  - Data are used to create abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts.
  - Seasonal pattern estimation and extrapolation are performed using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with site-year weighting based on the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed to emphasize observed counts over extrapolated ones.

- Data processing, quality control, and validation
  - Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online or via a Transect Walker program before uploading to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, species outside flight period).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; ongoing validation occurs throughout the season.
  - Additional automated and manual validation screens for out-of-range distributions, atypical abundances, or anomalies relative to the site’s history; corrections are made via queries and, if needed, direct edits to the UKBMS dataset.

- Data download and metadata
  - The download provides location and attribute data for UK sites monitored from 1976 to 2020; sensitive sites are omitted.
  - Data format: comma-separated values (CSV).
  - Key columns include: Site number, Site name, Grid reference, Easting/Northing, Length, Country, Number of sections, Years surveyed, First/Last year surveyed, and Survey type (Standard UKBMS vs WCBS).

- Licence, attribution, and use
  - Data are released under the Open Government Licence (OGL) with permissive use conditions.
  - Required: citation with DOI, and attribution: “Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, UKCEH, BTO, JNCC.”
  - Since 2017, submitters have agreed to data being available under OGL; some historical data may carry third-party IP considerations.

- Collaboration and support
  - UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset use and interpretation, with opportunities for co-authorship and collaboration in publications and presentations.

- Opportunities and challenges for analysts
  - Value enhancement: integrate UKBMS data with other relevant datasets to avoid “single-use” datasets and to enrich analyses.
  - Data accessibility: emphasize enabling access to the underlying data used to produce outputs, supporting broader scrutiny and reuse.
