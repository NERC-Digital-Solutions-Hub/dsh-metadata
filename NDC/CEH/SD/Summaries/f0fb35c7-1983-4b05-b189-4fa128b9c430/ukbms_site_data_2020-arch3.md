# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - Coordinated and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
  - Acknowledges volunteers; provides annual site-based data on butterfly population status to inform biodiversity policy and trend analysis.

- Monitoring framework and data collection methods
  - Three sampling components:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide belt, recorded weekly up to 26 times/year, ~2000 sites.
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year (plus encouraged spring visits), ~800 squares/year.
    - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species or habitats.
  - Data types include counts across species and habitat sections, enabling combined analyses across all methods.

- Data processing and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Site indices are weighted representations of the observed proportion of butterflies at a site; collated species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with year/site-specific weighting to reflect survey effort and flight period coverage.
  - All seasonal counts from Pollard walks, WCBS, and reduced surveys contribute to estimating seasonal patterns and adjusting for gaps.

- Quality control and data validation
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online; automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusual counts, species outside flight period).
  - Regional transect coordinators review records; subsequent automated and manual validation checks are applied.
  - Data corrections are made through queries and coordination with transect recorders as needed.

- Data download contents and format
  - Covers UK locations monitored from 1976 to 2020; sensitive sites excluded.
  - Provided as a CSV file with columns including: Site number, Site name, Grid reference, Easting, Northing, Length, Country, No. of sections, No. of years surveyed, First and Last year surveyed, Survey type (UKBMS or WCBS).
