# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - A national program to monitor butterfly population status across the UK, organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteer data; aims to support understanding of biodiversity status and policy questions related to trends.

- Data collection framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route line transects (2–4 km) walked weekly, 26 counts per year, 5 m width, across almost 2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum 2 visits in July/August), ~800 squares per year.
  - Targeted surveys: Single-species transects, Timed counts, and egg/larval web counts using transect and non-transect methods to target specific species or life stages.

- Data types and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts; site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present, with variation by species.
  - Overall species indices created with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), weighting site-year data by the proportion of the species flight period observed to account for gaps.
  - All sampling methods contribute to seasonal pattern estimation and extrapolation to account for incomplete data, with greater weight given to observed data.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
  - Automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods); regional transect coordinators conduct ongoing validation.
  - Additional automated/manual validation checks for distribution, flight period alignment, first-time site records, and atypical abundances; edits made to the dataset as needed.

- Data download and dataset details
  - Download covers location and attribute data for UK monitoring sites from 1976 to 2020; sensitive sites excluded.
  - Data provided as a CSV file with columns including: Site number, Site name, Grid reference, Easting, Northing, Length, Country, No. of Sections, No. of Years surveyed, First year surveyed, Last year surveyed, Survey type (UKBMS or WCBS).

- Licence and attribution
  - Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use and reuse with minimal conditions.
  - Requires proper citation (including DOI) in publications, and an attribution statement: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.
  - Since 2017, submitters have agreed to OGL for data submission; historical data may have third-party IP considerations.

- Collaboration and contact
  - UKBMS partners offer advice and help interpret outputs; potential for co-authorship and intellectual input in publications.
