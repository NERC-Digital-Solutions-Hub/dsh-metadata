# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - It relies on volunteers to collect annual site-based butterfly population data.
  - It provides long-term data (since 1976) to understand population trends and inform biodiversity policy.

- Data collection framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, recorded weekly (up to 26 visits/year) during suitable butterfly activity, across ~2000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits/year to sample common habitats; ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or periods.

- Data types and trend analysis
  - Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Indices reflect consistent proportion of butterflies observed; detectability varies by species.
  - Seasonal indices are combined using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016) with site-year weighting based on the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed.
  - All counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS are used to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps; weighting emphasizes observed data over extrapolated data.

- Quality control
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online (UKBMS data entry site) or via Transect Walker before upload.
  - Automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-flight-period records); regional transect coordinators validate data and address issues.
  - Additional automated and manual validation checks query records that are out of range, out of distribution, new at a site, or unusually divergent, with edits made as needed.

- Data download details
  - Timeframe: 1976–2020; sensitive sites are excluded.
  - Format: CSV file containing location and attribute data for monitored sites.
  - Key columns include: Site number, Site name, Grid reference, Easting, Northing, Length of transect, Country, Number of sections, Years surveyed, First/Last year surveyed, and Survey type (standard UKBMS or WCBS).
  - Provides coordinates and site-level metadata to enable re-use and mapping.

- Licence and attribution
  - Data are provided under the Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use with minimal conditions.
  - Must include full citation with the dataset’s DOI in any publications using the data.
  - Attribution required: “Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.”
  - Since 2017, submitters have consented to data availability under OGL; rare historical IP restrictions may apply if raised by submitters.

- Collaboration and contact details
  - UKBMS partners offer advisory support and interpretation assistance for outputs.
  - Opportunities for co-authorship and intellectual input in publications or presentations resulting from UKBMS data.
