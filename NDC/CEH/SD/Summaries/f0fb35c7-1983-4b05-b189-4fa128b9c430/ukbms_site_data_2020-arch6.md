# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview and purpose
- Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
- Volunteers contribute data; scheme monitors butterfly population status across the UK.
- Active data collection from >2,500 sites annually; ongoing since 1976.
- Data support understanding trends in biodiversity and inform policy questions.

## Sampling framework
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 45 minutes to 2 hours, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) across a fixed 5 m band; almost 2,000 sites.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects; 2–3 visits per year (plus encouraged spring visits); about 800 squares annually.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species.

## Data type, structure, and analysis
- Data yield abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices scaled to overall species indices using Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016) with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
- All counts from Pollard walks, WCBS, and reduced surveys are used to model seasonal patterns and interpolate missing data; observed data have greater influence due to weighting.

## Quality control and validation
- Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online via UKBMS or Transect Walker; uploaded to centralized database.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, species outside flight period).
- Regional transect coordinators review records; ongoing validation throughout the season.
- Further automated/manual validation targets records out of range, atypical abundances, or first-time site records; corrections and edits made to the main dataset as needed.

## Data download and metadata
- Download covers location and attribute data for UK butterfly monitoring sites from 1976–2020; sensitive sites excluded.
- Data provided as CSV; includes:
  - Site number, site name, grid reference, easting/northing, length, country, number of sections, years surveyed, first/last year surveyed, survey type (UKBMS or WCBS).

## Licence, attribution, and reuse
- Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use with few conditions.
- Require proper citation (including DOI) in any reports/publications using the data.
- Attribution to UKBMS data: "Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, JNCC."
- Since 2017, submitter consent to data sharing under OGL; historic IP restrictions possible but users should accommodate if notified.

## Collaboration and contact
- Partners offer guidance on data interpretation and interpretation of outputs.
- Potential for co-authorship and intellectual input in publications, conferences, or posters resulting from UKBMS data.
