# Materials and methods, and metadata for Measured and modelled DOC concentrations, and chlorophyll concentration, for UK freshwaters and freshwater mesocosms, 2014-2015. Data taken from 'The contribution of algae to freshwater dissolved organic matter: implications for UV spectroscopic analysis', Adams et al, 2018 Inland Waters

## Overview
- Datasets documenting measured and modelled dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) for UK freshwaters and freshwater mesocosms during 2014–2015.
- Measurements include DOC (TOC), DOC modelled via UV-Vis absorbance (Carter model), absorbance at 270 nm and 350 nm, Chl-a concentrations, pH, and electrical conductivity.
- Data sourced from natural sites (meres, lakes, reservoirs, farm ponds, rivers) and from the CEH aquatic mesocosm facility (CAMF) experiments, focusing on algae-derived DOM and implications for UV spectroscopy.
- Structure comprises site-specific tables (field sites and mesocosms) and time-series data for mesocosms, with detailed metadata to support data discovery, reuse, and quality assessment.

## Study Design and Sampling

### Study Sites
- Shropshire-Cheshire meres: North West Midland outwash plains; catchments dominated by agricultural, urban, and parkland areas.
- Reported range for average chlorophyll-a across the region: 2–68 μg L-1.
- Additional field sites: 10 small lakes in the Lake District National Park, 4 reservoirs in West Yorkshire, and 10 farm ponds in Fylde (Lancashire) plus rivers/streams in Yorkshire.
- Data include site names, locations, DOC measured (TOC), DOC modelled (Carter model), absorbance values, Chl-a, pH, and conductivity.
- Chl-a values and site characteristics referenced from prior studies (e.g., Fisher et al., 2009; Reynolds, 1979; Moss et al., 2005).

### Mesocosm Experiments
- Location: CEH Aquatic Mesocosm Facility (CAMF), containing 32 mesocosms (2 m diameter, 1 m deep) simulating shallow lakes.
- Experimental subset: 4 mesocosms (Tanks 4, 7, 15, 20) selected to represent a range of Chl-a and DOM responses.
- Treatments in stressor experiment:
  - Heating: 4 °C above ambient for some tanks.
  - Nutrient addition: intermittent addition of nutrients free from nitrogen or phosphorus.
  - Specific tank treatments:
    - Mesocosm 4 and 20: unheated, ambient temperature ~14.6 °C, intermittent nutrient addition.
    - Mesocosm 7: heated with intermittent nutrient addition.
    - Mesocosm 15: heated without intermittent nutrient addition.
- Sampling: seven occasions between February and August 2015.
- Assumption: DOM produced during the observation period results from algal fixation of atmospheric CO2 and subsequent release as DOM.

## Data Collected and Metadata

### Table S1a – Shropshire-Cheshire meres field data
- Columns cover: site code (SCM), site name, sample ID, date, latitude, longitude, [DOC] measured (mg/L), [DOC] modelled (mg/L, Carter model), absorbance at 270 nm (Abs 270, Au), absorbance at 350 nm (Abs 350, Au), [chl-a] (µg/L), pH, conductivity (µS cm-1).
- Purpose: document measured and modelled DOC alongside UV-absorbance and chlorophyll data for meres.

### Table S1b – Other field sites
- Columns cover: site code (types include LD = Lake District, PR = reservoirs, FP = farm ponds, YR = Yorkshire rivers), site name, sample ID, date, latitude, longitude, [DOC] measured, [DOC] modelled, Abs 270, Abs 350, [chl-a], pH (measured for new samples), conductivity.
- Notes: provides site-level metadata and comparable variables to Table S1a for a broader dataset.

### Table S1c – Mesocosm tank time-series
- Columns cover: mesocosm tank number, date, [DOC] measured, [DOC] modelled, Abs 270, Abs 350, [chl-a], pH, conductivity.
- Purpose: capture temporal dynamics of DOC, Chl-a, and related optics/chemistry within each mesocosm under experimental treatments.

### Table S2 – Mesocosm [DOC] and [Chla] with transformations
- Columns cover: mesocosm tank number, date, [DOC] measured, [chl-a] measured, log([DOC]), log([chl-a]).
- Purpose: provides log-transformed values to support statistical analyses and modeling of DOM and algal parameters.

## Data Management and Quality Considerations
- Metadata definitions and column explanations are provided (e.g., Table heading explanations for Tables S1a–S1c and Table S2).
- Documentation supports discoverability, interpretability, and reuse, including units and measurement methods (e.g., TOC for [DOC], UV-Vis-based model for [DOC] modelled).
- Data originate from field surveys and controlled mesocosm experiments, enabling comparisons across natural and experimental conditions.
- References cited for site context and prior findings: Reynolds (1979); Moss et al. (2005); Fisher et al. (2009).
