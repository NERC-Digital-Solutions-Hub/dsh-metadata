# Materials and methods, and metadata for Measured and modelled DOC concentrations, and chlorophyll concentration, for UK freshwaters and freshwater mesocosms, 2014-2015. Data taken from 'The contribution of algae to freshwater dissolved organic matter: implications for UV spectroscopic analysis', Adams et al, 2018 Inland Waters

## Overview
- Documents the measured and modelled concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll a (Chla) for UK freshwaters and freshwater mesocosms, collected in 2014–2015.
- Data derive from Adams et al. (2018) Inland Waters and are organized for consistency to support environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessment over time.
- Includes site metadata, measurement methods, and model details to enable standardized analysis and data reuse.

## Study sites
- Shropshire-Cheshire meres in the North West Midland outwash plains, draining small agricultural, urban, and parkland catchments.
- Additional sites: small lakes in the Lake District National Park, reservoirs in West Yorkshire (upland moorland catchments), and farm ponds in the Fylde area of Lancashire, plus rivers and small streams in Yorkshire.
- Reported mean chlorophyll a (Chla) range across the meres: 2–68 μg L−1.
- Site naming and coding conventions include SCM (Shropshire/Cheshire Meres) and other site codes for LD (Lake District), PR (reservoirs), FP (farm ponds), and YR (Yorkshire rivers).

## Mesocosm experiments
- Conducted within the CEH aquatic mesocosm facility (CAMF), comprising 32 mesocosms (2 m diameter, 1 m deep) simulating shallow lakes.
- Four mesocosms (4, 7, 15, 20) selected to span a range of Chla concentrations for a multiple-stressor experiment.
- Treatments included heating (+4 °C above ambient) and nutrient additions (nitrogen- or phosphorus-free), with variations:
  - Mesocosm 4 and 20: unheated with intermittent nutrient addition, ambient average temperature 14.6 °C.
  - Mesocosm 7: heated with intermittent nutrient addition.
  - Mesocosm 15: heated without intermittent nutrient addition.
- Sampling occurred on seven occasions between February and August 2015.
- Assumption: DOM produced in mesocosms during the observation period resulted from algal fixation of atmospheric CO2 and subsequent release as DOM.

## Data content and table metadata (S1–S2)
- Table S1a: Shropshire-Cheshire meres – site names, locations, measured DOC, modelled DOC (Carter model), absorbance at 270 and 350 nm, chlorophyll a, pH, and conductivity; includes site and sample identifiers and date, latitude, longitude.
- Table S1b: Other field sites – LD lakes, reservoirs (PR), farm ponds (FP), Yorkshire rivers (YR) with the same variables as S1a.
- Table S1c: Mesocosm tanks – time-series data for DOC measured (TOC), DOC modelled (UV-Vis/Carter model), absorbance (270 and 350 nm), chlorophyll a, pH, and conductivity by date; includes tank number and sampling date.
- Table S2: DOC and Chla values for mesocosms – includes [DOC] measured and modelled, absorbance, [chl-a], and their log-transformed counterparts (Log [DOC], Log [chl-a]); also contains date and tank identification.

## Measurements and modeling methods
- DOC measured by total organic carbon (TOC) analysis.
- DOC concentration modelled from UV-Vis absorbance using the Carter model.
- Absorbance measurements at 270 nm and 350 nm.
- Chlorophyll a concentrations reported in µg L−1.
- pH values (no units) and conductivity in µS cm−1.
- Data organization uses consistent site codes, sample IDs, dates, and geographic coordinates to facilitate cross-site comparisons.

## Access, use, and implications for monitoring (analysts’ perspective)
- Metadata-rich dataset designed for transparent monitoring and policy evaluation, with standardized column headings and units to enable robust time-series analyses.
- Data are prepared for storage and upload to appropriate portals to improve accessibility and reuse, aligning with goals to:
  - Increase the value of monitoring datasets by linking with other relevant data.
  - Improve access to the underlying data used to produce final outputs.
- Clear documentation of measurement and modelling approaches supports reproducibility and inter-site comparability for environmental health monitoring.
