# Materials and methods, and metadata for Measured and modelled DOC concentrations, and chlorophyll concentration, for UK freshwaters and freshwater mesocosms, 2014-2015. Data taken from 'The contribution of algae to freshwater dissolved organic matter: implications for UV spectroscopic analysis', Adams et al, 2018 Inland Waters

## Overview
- Provides materials, methods, and metadata for measured and modeled dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations in UK freshwaters and freshwater mesocosms, covering 2014–2015.
- Data derived from Adams et al. (2018) Inland Waters; intended to support analysis of relationships between DOM, Chla, and UV-Vis absorbance proxies, and to enable data-driven exploration.

## Study Sites and Field Sampling
- Shropshire-Cheshire meres located in the North West Midland outwash plains; catchments are largely agricultural, urban, and parkland.
- Reported mean Chla across the meres region ranges from 2 to 68 μg/L.
- Additional field sites include:
  - Small lakes in the Lake District National Park
  - Reservoirs in West Yorkshire
  - Farm ponds in the Fylde area (Lancashire)
  - Rivers and small streams in Yorkshire
- Data tables include:
  - Table S1a: Shropshire-Cheshire meres – site codes, locations, DOC measured (TOC mg/L), DOC modeled (Carter UV-Vis mg/L), absorbance at 270 and 350 nm, chl-a, pH, conductivity.
  - Table S1b: other field sites – similar variables; site codes indicate LD, PR, FP, YR types.

## Mesocosm Experiments
- Conducted at CEH Aquatic Mesocosm Facility (CAMF) with 32 mesocosms (each about 2 m diameter, 1 m deep) simulating shallow lakes.
- Four mesocosms selected for the multiple-stressor experiment: tanks 4, 7, 15, and 20, to span a range of Chla concentrations.
- Treatments:
  - Heating: +4 °C above ambient
  - Nutrient addition: intermittent addition of nutrients free from nitrogen or phosphorus
- Specific tanks:
  - Tank 4: unheated, intermittent nutrient addition
  - Tank 7: heated, intermittent nutrient addition
  - Tank 15: heated, no intermittent nutrient addition
  - Tank 20: unheated, intermittent nutrient addition
- Sampling occurred on 7 occasions between February and August 2015.
- Assumption: DOM produced in mesocosms results from algae fixing atmospheric CO2 and releasing DOM.

## Data Tables and Variables
- Table S1a: field sites (meres)
  - Columns include site code (SCM), site name, sample IDs, date, latitude, longitude, [DOC] measured (mg/L), [DOC] modeled (mg/L; Carter UV-Vis), Abs at 270 nm and 350 nm (Au), [Chla] (μg/L), pH, conductivity (μS cm^-1).
  - pH values for some sites drawn from Fisher et al. (2009).
- Table S1b: other field sites
  - Similar structure; site type indicated by site code (LD = Lake District, PR = reservoirs, FP = farm ponds, YR = Yorkshire rivers).
- Table S1c: mesocosm tanks time series
  - Tank number, date, [DOC] measured (mg/L), [DOC] modeled (mg/L), Abs 270, Abs 350, [Chla] (μg/L), pH, conductivity.
- Table S2: time-series for DOC and Chla with transformed values
  - Includes Log [DOC] and Log [Chla] (no units).
- Column heading explanations provide units and descriptions for all fields (e.g., sample ID, date, latitude/longitude, DOC measurements, modeled DOC, absorbance values, chl-a, pH, conductivity).

## Modeling and Methods
- DOC modeled values derived from UV-Vis absorbance data; Carter model used for DOC concentration modeling.
- Absorbance at 270 nm and 350 nm used as proxies related to DOM characteristics.
- Chlorophyll-a concentrations measured; some pH values obtained from prior study (Fisher et al. 2009) for consistency across sites.

## Codes, Units, and Referencing
- Site code conventions:
  - SCM: Shropshire/Cheshire Meres
  - LD: Lake District
  - PR: reservoirs
  - FP: farm ponds
  - YR: Yorkshire rivers
- Spatial coverage spans NW Midlands meres, Lake District, reservoirs in Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, Fylde farm ponds, and regional rivers/streams.
- References cited within the dataset include Reynolds (1979), Moss et al. (2005), Fisher et al. (2009), and Adams et al. (2018).
