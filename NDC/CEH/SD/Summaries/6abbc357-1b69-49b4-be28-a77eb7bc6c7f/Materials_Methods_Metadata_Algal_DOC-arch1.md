# Materials and methods, and metadata for Measured and modelled DOC concentrations, and chlorophyll concentration, for UK freshwaters and freshwater mesocosms, 2014-2015

- Objective and scope
  - Provides materials, methods, and metadata for measured and modeled DOC concentrations and chlorophyll a across UK freshwater sites and freshwater mesocosms for 2014–2015.
  - Data underpin analysis of algae contributions to dissolved organic matter (DOM) and implications for UV spectroscopic analysis (Adams et al., 2018).

- Study sites
  - Shropshire-Cheshire meres: NW Midland outwash plains; catchments dominated by agriculture, urban areas, and parkland.
  - Reported DOC ranges (~2–68 μg L−1) for the region.
  - Additional sampling locations: 10 small Lake District lakes; 4 reservoirs in West Yorkshire; 10 small farm ponds in Fylde; rivers/streams in Yorkshire.
  - Site information includes coordinates, DOC measured, DOC modeled (Carter model), UV absorbance (270 nm, 350 nm), chlorophyll a, pH, and conductivity.

- Mesocosm experiments
  - Conducted at the CEH Aquatic Mesocosm Facility (CAMF); 32 mesocosms (2 m diameter, 1 m deep) simulating shallow lakes.
  - Four mesocosms selected (numbers 4, 7, 15, 20) to encompass a range of chlorophyll a concentrations.
  - Treatments: heating (+4 °C) and nutrient additions (nitrogen or phosphorus status varied).
  - Temperature regime: mesocosms 4 and 20 unheated (ambient ~14.6 °C); mesocosm 7 heated with intermittent nutrient addition; mesocosm 15 heated without intermittent nutrient addition.
  - Sampling schedule: seven occasions between February and August 2015.
  - Assumption: DOM produced during the study period originates from algal fixation of atmospheric CO2 and is released as DOM.

- Measurements and modeling
  - DOC: measured by TOC analysis; also modeled DOC using UV-Vis absorbance (Carter model).
  - Absorbance: measured at 270 nm and 350 nm.
  - Chlorophyll a: concentration reported (various units depending on table).
  - Additional water quality parameters: pH and conductivity.
  - Data organization includes site-level data (meres and other field sites) and time-series data for mesocosms.

- Tables and column definitions (Table S1a–c, Table S2)
  - Table S1a (Shropshire-Cheshire meres)
    - Columns include: site code (SCM), site name, sample ID, date, latitude, longitude, [DOC] measured, [DOC] modeled (Carter model), Abs at 270, Abs at 350, [chl-a], pH, conductivity.
  - Table S1b (Other field sites)
    - Columns include: site code (LD, PR, FP, YR), site name, sample ID, date, latitude, longitude, [DOC] measured, [DOC] modeled, Abs at 270, Abs at 350, [chl-a], pH, conductivity.
  - Table S1c (Mesocosm time series)
    - Columns include: mesocosm tank number, date, [DOC] measured, [DOC] modeled, Abs at 270, Abs at 350, [chl-a], pH, conductivity.
  - Table S2 (DOC and Chla in mesocosms)
    - Columns include: mesocosm tank number, date, [DOC] measured, [DOC] modeled, Log [DOC], [chl-a], Log [chl-a].
  - Notes on units and column explanations accompany each table (e.g., DOC in mg/L; Absorbance in Absorbance units; Chl-a in µg/L or related units; pH unitless; conductivity in µS cm−1).

- Data transformations and modeling notes
  - DOC modeled using UV-Vis absorbance via the Carter model; both measured and modeled DOC are provided.
  - Log-transformed DOC and chlorophyll a values are included in Table S2 to support statistical analyses.
  - Site codes and dataset structure support cross-site comparisons and integration with related datasets.

- Context and references
  - Provides background citations for site characteristics and water quality context (Reynolds 1979; Moss et al. 2005; Fisher et al. 2009).
  - Links to related methodological and environmental context for interpreting UV-Vis and DOM relationships.

- Practical notes for analysts
  - Metadata includes precise definitions of site codes and data columns to facilitate data cleaning, harmonization, and replication.
  - Data are organized to support analyses of correlations between DOC, chlorophyll a, absorbance spectra, and basic physico-chemical parameters across spatially diverse UK freshwater systems and controlled mesocosm experiments.
