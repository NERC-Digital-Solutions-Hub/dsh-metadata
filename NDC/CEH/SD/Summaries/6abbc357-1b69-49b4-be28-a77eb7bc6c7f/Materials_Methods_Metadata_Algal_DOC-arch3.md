# Materials and methods, and metadata for Measured and modelled DOC concentrations, and chlorophyll concentration, for UK freshwaters and freshwater mesocosms, 2014-2015. Data taken from 'The contribution of algae to freshwater dissolved organic matter: implications for UV spectroscopic analysis', Adams et al, 2018 Inland Waters

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents materials, methods, and metadata for measured and modeled dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) across UK freshwaters and freshwater mesocosms (2014–2015).
  - Data underpin analyses of algae-derived DOM and UV-spectroscopic implications.

- Study sites and sampling context
  - Field sites: Shropshire-Cheshire meres (North West Midland outwash plains) with diverse catchments (agricultural, urban, parkland).
  - Additional field sites: small Lake District lakes, reservoirs in West Yorkshire, farm ponds in Fylde, and rivers/streams in Yorkshire.
  - Reported historical ranges for Chl-a concentrations across sites prior to this study.

- Mesocosm experiments
  - Conducted at the CEH aquatic mesocosm facility (CAMF) with 32 mesocosms (2 m diameter, 1 m deep) simulating shallow lakes.
  - Four mesocosms (4, 7, 15, 20) selected to span a range of chlorophyll/chl-a conditions.
  - Treatments: heating (+4 °C) and nutrient addition (nutrients without nitrogen or phosphorus in certain treatments or intermittent additions in others).
  - Ambient temperature ~14.6 °C; sampling occurred on 7 occasions between February and August 2015.
  - Assumption: DOM produced during the observation period derived from algae fixing atmospheric CO2 and releasing DOM.

- Measured and modelled variables
  - [DOC] measured by TOC analysis; [DOC] modelled from UV-Vis absorbance (Carter model) or related methods.
  - Absorbance at 270 nm and 350 nm.
  - Chlorophyll a concentration ([chl-a]).
  - pH and conductivity of water samples.
  - Data organized for multiple site types: field sites (Table S1a and S1b) and mesocosm time series (Table S1c and Table S2).

- Tables and metadata structure
  - Table S1a: Shropshire-Cheshire Meres – site names, locations, DOC measured, DOC modelled, absorbance, chl-a, pH, conductivity; includes site code, sample IDs, dates, coordinates, and measurement units.
  - Table S1b: Other field sites (LD lakes, reservoirs, farm ponds, Yorkshire rivers) with analogous columns.
  - Table S1c: Mesocosm tanks – time-series data including date, DOC measured, DOC modelled, absorbances, chl-a, pH, conductivity.
  - Table S2: Time-series data focusing on [DOC], [Chl-a], and their log-transformed values for mesocosms.
  - Column heading explanations provide precise definitions, units, and notes (e.g., site codes, sample IDs, measurement methods, and data transformations such as log(DOC)).

- Data provenance and references
  - Data are drawn from Adams et al. 2018, Inland Waters: The contribution of algae to freshwater dissolved organic matter: implications for UV spectroscopic analysis.
  - Site-specific metadata references include Reynolds (1979), Moss et al. (2005), and Fisher et al. (2009) for context on site characteristics and prior measurements.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates integration of field measurements with modeled proxies (UV-Vis based DOC) across diverse UK freshwater systems.
  - Provides comprehensive metadata and standardized column definitions to support data reuse, comparability, and transparency.
  - Highlights practical data governance considerations: data provenance, metadata completeness, and the need for clear documentation to enable verification and reuse.

- Practical considerations for data users and governance
  - Accessibility: extensive metadata and column explanations facilitate data sharing and reuse, though public access to underlying data and intermediate datasets should be clarified.
  - Metadata quality: detailed table column explanations mitigate barriers due to inadequate metadata.
  - Data transformation and standardization: explicit descriptions of modelled vs. measured variables and unit definitions support consistent analyses.
  - Governance implications: example of ensuring data quality, open documentation, and traceability from field measurements to model outputs in monitoring programs.
