# NERC project NE/R000875/1, Objective 3, Experiment 3: ReadMe document for data files

- The data files document data collected in Objective 3, Experiment 3 of the NERC project NE/R000875/1.
- Aim of the experiment: manipulate the fecundity-longevity relationship in Drosophila melanogaster by changing larval diet across three regimes.
  - Diets: 1) 20% SYA, 2) 100% SYA, 3) 120% SYA.
- Data collected from adult flies include:
  - Death dates for individuals
  - Egg counts every other day
  - Offspring counts every other day
- References for protocol and related manuscript are provided:
  - Protocol_NER0008751_Objective 3_Experiment 3_v1_2018-05-05.docx
  - Collins et al. manuscript on the effect of larval diet on fecundity-longevity and age-related gene expression

- Data format and structure:
  - All data are in CSV files.
  - Each file’s columns are described in dedicated tables; each row corresponds to a single observation or entity.
  - NA denotes missing values; '.' indicates missing data for a specific count; '*' denotes null means arising from missing values.

- Data relationships and usage notes:
  - Datasets are interrelated via identifiers such as Diet, Source_population, Life_history_number, and Treatment.
  - Life-history data (LH_data) connect to individual females and their mating/offspring records (mating_events, offspring_counts).
  - Replacement and RNA sampling data document experimental contingencies and molecular sampling plans.
  - Tissue_sample data reflect pooled RNA samples (each pool combines multiple individuals) with replicate labeling.

- Practical considerations for data support:
  - The dataset provides rich, per-fly, per-vial, and per-mating-event granularity suitable for exploring fecundity, longevity, and their interactions under different larval diets.
  - Missing data handling is explicit (NA, '.', '*'), and multiple derived metrics are provided to facilitate analysis (means, totals, rates).
