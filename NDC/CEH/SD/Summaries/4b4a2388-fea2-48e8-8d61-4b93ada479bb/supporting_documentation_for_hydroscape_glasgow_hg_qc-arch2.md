- Relevance for environmental analysts:
  - Provides standardized outputs (numbers, units) for environmental health monitoring and policy performance.
  - Facilitates quality assurance through defined table headings, reference materials, and procedural blanks.
  - Supports data management practices: storage and upload of datasets to appropriate portals.
- Key challenges (from the broader monitoring context):
  - Increasing the value of monitoring datasets by combining with other relevant data (avoiding single-use datasets).
  - Enabling access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs.
