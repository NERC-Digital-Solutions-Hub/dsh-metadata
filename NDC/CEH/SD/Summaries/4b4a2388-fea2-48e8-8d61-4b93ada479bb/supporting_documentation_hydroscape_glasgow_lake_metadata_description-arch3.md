# Project: Historical lake sediment metal concentrations from Greater Glasgow

## Overview
- Metadata describe a project collecting historical lake sediment core data to assess metal concentrations in the Greater Glasgow area.
- Data and metadata are stored/uploaded in EIDC, with the metadata file titled hydroscape_glasgow_core_metadata.csv.

## Data content and structure
- Core/site identifiers and naming:
  - WBID (Waterbody Identification number)
  - Hydroscape (region name)
  - Name (Lake Name)
  - UCL_Code (internal code)
  - UCL Sample ID (internal unique sample/core ID)
- Core location and depth information:
  - General location of core: deep, littoral, or intermediate
  - OSGB36_E (eastings) and OSGB36_N (northings) coordinates
  - Water depth at core site (m)
  - Secchi disc depth (m) (water clarity)
  - Core length and type
- Sampling and dating details:
  - Corer types (e.g., Tapper)
  - Date core collected (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - 210 Pb-dated (Y/N) for Hydroscape
- Source and hosting:
  - Source: UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (Hydroscape)
  - File: hydroscape_glasgow_core_metadata.csv uploaded to EIDC

## Metadata quality and governance
- Metadata completeness and accuracy are key for usability and comparability.
- 210Pb dating status provides essential temporal context for metal concentration history.
- Public sharing of underlying datasets may present barriers; metadata and provenance must be clear to enable reuse.
- Data management considerations include provenance from originators, data standards, and ongoing updates.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Enables spatial-temporal analysis of historical metal concentrations in Glasgow-area lakes.
- Supports cross-lake comparisons and trend assessment to inform environmental health decisions.
- Provides standardized core metadata and unique identifiers to facilitate traceability and reproducibility.
- Highlights governance needs (data access, metadata standards, data sharing) to ensure timely, open, and usable information for policy evaluation and planning.
