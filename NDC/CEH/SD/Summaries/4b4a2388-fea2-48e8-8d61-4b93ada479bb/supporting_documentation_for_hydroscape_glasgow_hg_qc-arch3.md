## Overview
- Describes the table headings for results of mercury measurements in core sediments using Cold Vapor Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS).
- Focuses on measurements of reference sediment (LKSD2) and procedural blanks accompanying the Glasgow Hg cores.

## Measurements and methods
- Glasgow Hg Core Runs: names of Hg cores processed through the CV-AFS instrument.
- Tube Code, Description: tube identifiers (e.g., LKSD2) for each measurement.
- Standard Sediment mass, Description: nominal mass of reference sediment weighed out (~0.2 g).
- Hg ng/g, Description: mercury concentration in sediment expressed in ng/g.
- Hg µg/g, Description: mercury concentration in sediment expressed in µg/g.
- Measured blank (ng/ml), Description: mercury concentration measured in procedural blanks (ng/ml).
- LKSD2 Reference Sediment Value: 160 ± 19 ng/g.
- Partial Extraction using HNO3: method reference for the LKSD2 measurements.

## Data structure and key fields
- The document enumerates the core runs, tube codes, and associated Hg concentration measurements in two units (ng/g and µg/g) alongside blank measurements.
- The reference sediment value provides a QA/QC benchmark for the measurements.

## Reference material and QA/QC
- LKSD2 Reference Sediment Value = 160 ± 19 ng/g, used as a standard for calibration and quality control.
- Partial extraction with HNO3 indicates the extraction method used for the reference sediment.
- Procedural blanks are captured to monitor contamination and instrument noise.

## Data governance and dissemination relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Emphasizes the importance of standardized reference materials and clear QA/QC documentation to ensure data quality and comparability across monitoring programs.
- Highlights the need for transparent metadata (units, methods, reference values) to enable reuse and verification of results.
- Notes potential governance considerations such as data sharing of underlying measurements and maintaining up-to-date reference values.

## Challenges and considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Ensuring consistent reference materials and units across sites.
- Maintaining metadata completeness (e.g., method details, extraction procedures, blank definitions).
- Facilitating data accessibility while preserving data provenance and QA/QC context.
