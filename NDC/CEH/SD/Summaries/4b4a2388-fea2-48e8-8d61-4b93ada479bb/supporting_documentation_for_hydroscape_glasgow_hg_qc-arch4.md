# Glasgow Hg Core Runs

## What this document describes
- Describes table headings showing results of measurements of reference sediment LKSD2 and procedural blanks, processed and run with core sediments measured by Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS).

## Data columns / fields
- Glasgow Hg Core Runs: Name of Hg cores run through the CV-AFS machine.
- Tube Code: Tube code (LKSD2…).
- Standard Sediment mass: Mass of reference sediment weighed (~0.2 g).
- Hg ng/g: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as ng/g.
- Hg µg/g: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as µg/g.
- Measured blank (ng/ml): Concentration of Hg measured in procedural blank (ng/ml).

## Reference sediment standard
- LKSD2 Reference Sediment Value = 160 ± 19 ng/g.
- Partial extraction using HNO3.

## Method
- Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS).

## Data provenance and references
- Lynch, J. (1990). Provisional Elemental Values for Eight New Geochemical Lake Sediment and Stream Sediment Reference Materials LKSD-1 to LKSD-4, STSD-1 to STSD-4. Geostandards Newsletter, 14:153-167. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-908X.1990.tb00070.x.

## Implications for data quality and governance (Data Leaders perspective)
- Uses a defined reference material (LKSD2) to ensure traceability and QC of Hg measurements.
- Includes procedural blanks to assess contamination and measurement accuracy.
- Documents sample mass, measurement units, and extraction details to support reproducibility, metadata completeness, and data discoverability.
- Supports integration with broader data systems through standardized references and provenance.

## Relevance for data systems and strategy
- Demonstrates end-to-end data capture for a measurement series (core naming, sample mass, concentrations, blanks) aligned with data quality expectations.
- Highlights importance of standard materials, clear metadata, and published references to enable reuse and cross-study comparability.
