# hydroscape_glasgow_hg _cores_qc.csv

## Overview
- Describes the table headings for results of mercury measurements in core sediments using CV-AFS (Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy).
- Measurements involve reference sediment LKSD2 and procedural blanks processed alongside core sediments.
- Associated file contains core runs, tube codes, and QC-related values.

## Data fields and meanings
- Glasgow Hg Core Runs, Description: Name of Hg cores run through the CV-AFS machine.
- Tube Code, Description: Tube code (e.g., LKSD2) identifying samples.
- Standard Sediment mass, Description: Mass of reference sediment weighed out (approximately 0.2 g).
- Hg ng/g, Description: Mercury concentration in sediment expressed in ng/g.
- Hg µg/g, Description: Mercury concentration in sediment expressed in µg/g.
- Measured blank (ng/ml), Description: Concentration of Hg measured in the procedural blank (ng/ml).

## Reference material and QC values
- LKSD2 Reference Sediment Value: 160 ± 19 ng/g.
- Partial extraction performed using HNO3.

## Measurement context and method
- Core sediments measured by CV-AFS, with corresponding blanks to assess contamination and accuracy.
- Units relevant to measurements include ng/g and ng/ml for blanks.
