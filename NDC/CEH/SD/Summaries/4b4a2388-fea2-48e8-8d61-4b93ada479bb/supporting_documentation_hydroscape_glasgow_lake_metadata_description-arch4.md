# Project: Historical lake sediment metal concentrations from Greater Glasgow

## Overview
- Metadata-driven project documenting historical lake sediment metal concentrations for Greater Glasgow.
- Data file uploaded to EIDC: hydroscape_glasgow_core_metadata.csv, with descriptive metadata fields to support discovery and use.

## Data assets and structure
- Core metadata file includes:
  - EIDC File Name and Description
  - WBID (Waterbody Identification number)
  - Hydroscape (Hydroscape region name)
  - Lake Name
  - General location of core: deep, littoral, or intermediate
  - OSGB36_E and OSGB36_N coordinates (UK OS grid)
  - Water depth at core site (m)
  - Secchi disc depth (m)
  - Core length and type
  - Corer types (e.g., Tapper: Chambers, J. W.; Cameron, N. 2001)
  - Date core collected (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - UCL_Code and UCL Sample ID (internal codes)
  - 210 Pb-dated (Y/N) for Hydroscape

## Metadata details
- File name and description indicate upload provenance to EIDC.
- Internal lab/classification identifiers (UCL_Code, UCL Sample ID) support traceability across bags/databases.
- Geographic and physical core metadata enable spatial and stratigraphic context for analyses.

## Data accessibility and provenance
- Data stored in EIDC with explicit metadata fields for discoverability.
- 210 Pb dating indicator recorded, facilitating age-depth interpretation where available.
- Location data provided via OSGB36 coordinates, aiding mapping and integration with other datasets.

## Data quality, standards, and gaps
- Metadata includes core location type and standard dating flag, but broader metadata clarity and metadata standards may vary.
- Potential gaps highlighted by Data Leaders: fragmented data sources, inconsistent metadata detail, and varying data granularity.

## Use cases and stakeholders
- Supports assessment of historical metal concentrations in Glasgow-area lakes.
- Enables researchers and policymakers to understand spatial-temporal metal deposition patterns.
- Facilitates cross-institution collaboration through shared Hydroscape datasets and standardized metadata.

## Challenges and opportunities
- Understanding diverse user needs and ensuring co-ownership of data products.
- Overcoming scattered data sources and potential data gaps at required granularity.
- Access barriers such as paywalls and data protection constraints.
- Need for clear data standards, consistent metadata, and coordinated sector practices to reduce duplication and improve discoverability.
