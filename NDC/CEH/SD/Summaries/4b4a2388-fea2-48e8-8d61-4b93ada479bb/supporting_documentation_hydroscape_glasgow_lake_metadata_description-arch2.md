# Project: Historical lake sediment metal concentrations from Greater Glasgow

## Overview
- A project dataset documenting historical lake sediment metal concentrations from lakes in the Greater Glasgow area.
- Metadata file uploaded to EIDC: hydroscape_glasgow_core_metadata.csv.

## Data file and provenance
- EIDC File Name: hydroscape_glasgow_core_metadata.csv
- Description field for file: File name uploaded to EIDC (.csv).
- Context: Contains metadata for lake sediment cores within the Greater Glasgow Hydroscape region.

## Core sampling context
- General location of core: classification of core area as deep (central deep), littoral (near vegetation margin), or intermediate (mid-depth).
- Hydroscape: name of the Hydroscape region used for the dataset.
- Lake name: identification of the lake from which the core was collected.

## Geospatial and physical core data
- OSGB36_E: Easting coordinate in UK Ordnance Survey (OSGB36 Datum).
- OSGB36_N: Northing coordinate in UK Ordnance Survey (OSGB36 Datum).
- Water depth at core site (m): depth from water surface to sediment surface at the core site.
- Secchi disc depth (m): water clarity measurement taken before coring.
- Core length and type: length of the core in metres and its type.

## Sampling methods and documentation
- Corer types: reference to coring equipment used (see References below; includes Tapper and Cameron 2001).
- Date core collected: calendar date of fieldwork and core collection (dd/mm/yyyy).

## Sample identification and dating
- UCL_Code: internal UCL code used on bags/database.
- UCL Sample ID: internal (Amphora) code for the entire sample core (unique ID).
- 210 Pb-dated (Y/N) for Hydroscape: whether the core was dated using lead-210 dating during the project.

## Data management and accessibility
- Emphasis on verification, quality assurance, and data cleaning/transformation as part of standardised analysis.
- Outputs typically presented as reports, maps, and charts.
- Datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals (data stewardship and accessibility).

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Enables consistent temporal assessment of environmental health and policy performance.
- Facilitates integration with other datasets to increase value beyond single-use applications.
- Provides standardized metadata to support data reuse, interoperability, and transparency in environmental monitoring.
