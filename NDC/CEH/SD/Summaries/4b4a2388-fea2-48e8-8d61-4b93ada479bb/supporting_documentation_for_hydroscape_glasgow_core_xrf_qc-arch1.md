# hydroscape_glasgow_xrf_cores_qc.csv

## Overview
- Describes a table of results from XRF measurements of standard reference materials used during co-measurement of core sediments.
- Purpose: QA/QC to ensure machine stability and assess reliability of element identification.

## What is included
- Measured values from the run and certified values for sediments.
- Mean and standard deviation of measured sediment concentrations across runs.
- Recovery (%): difference between measured and certified values, used to assess accuracy.
- Typical benchmark: recovery of 95–105% is considered very good.

## Reference standards
- JLK-1 Reference Standards with core run (sediment standard sediment sample).
- LKSD2 Reference Standards with core run (sediment standard sediment sample).

## Data fields (examples)
- Run Code (UCL): Sample ID combining reference sediment type and date run.
- Measured Mean: Mean sediment concentration from all runs.
- Measured SD: Standard deviation of sediment concentration from all runs.
- Certified JLK-Ref Value: Certified value for elements in Reference 1.
- JLK-1 %Recovery: Percentage recovery for Reference 1.
- Certified LKSD2 Ref Value: Certified value for elements in Reference 2.
- LKSD2 %Recovery: Percentage recovery for Reference 2.

## Elements reported
- Major elements (as % dry mass): Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe.
- Trace elements (as µg/g or µg/g equivalents): V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb.

## How to interpret
- Compare measured values to certified values via %Recovery.
- Recovery in the 95–105% range indicates very good agreement and reliable measurements.
- Use Run Code to trace specific sample runs and associated element concentrations.
