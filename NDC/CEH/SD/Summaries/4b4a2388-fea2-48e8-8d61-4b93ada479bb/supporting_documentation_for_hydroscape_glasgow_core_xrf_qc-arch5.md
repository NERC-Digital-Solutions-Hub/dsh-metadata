# hydroscape_glasgow_xrf_cores_qc.csv

## Purpose and scope
- Describes the table of results from XRF measurements of standard reference materials used during co-measurement of core materials.
- Purpose is QA/QC: to ensure instrument stability and assess reliability of elemental identification.
- Reports both measured values and certified values for sediments, enabling assessment of accuracy.

## Data content and structure
- Includes measured mean and standard deviation (Mean, SD) of sediment element concentrations across all runs.
- Includes recovery metrics: %Recovery, calculated as the difference between measured and certified values relative to the certified value.
- Run Code (UCL) identifies the sample/run, combining reference sediment type and date.
- Elements and units covered:
  - % dry mass: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Mn
  - % dry mass: Fe
  - µg/g dry sediment: V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb
- Reference standards:
  - JLK-1: sediment reference values
  - LKSD2: sediment reference values
- Columns include measured values alongside certified reference values and corresponding recoveries for each element.

## Reference standards and provenance
- Ref 1: TERASHIMA et al. (1990) – nine new GSJ sedimentary rock reference samples.
- Ref 2: LYNCH (1990) – provisional elemental values for LKSD and related sediment reference materials.
- Certifications and recoveries are aligned with these references to validate measurement accuracy.

## Data quality indicators
- Recovery (%Recovery) used to evaluate QA/QC performance; a recovery range of 95–105% is considered very good.
- The dataset explicitly links measured values to certified values to support assessment of measurement reliability.

## Metadata and preservation
- Describes explicit metadata for each variable (e.g., Run Code, element names, units, measured mean, SD, certified values, and %Recovery).
- References provide provenance for the standard materials used, supporting traceability and reproducibility.

## Governance implications for Data Stewards
- Demonstrates essential data governance components:
  - Accurate recording of measurement results and QA/QC metrics.
  - Clear linkage between measured data and certified reference values.
  - Documentation of data provenance through standard references.
  - Well-defined metadata and column descriptions to support discovery, reuse, and interoperability.
- Supports data sharing and cataloging by providing standardized fields and unit conventions, aiding dataset discoverability and reliability.

## Practical considerations and end notes
- The document emphasizes machine stability checks and measurement reliability, which informs data stewardship practices around ongoing QA/QC processes.
- While focused on QA/QC results, the structure implies the importance of maintaining and updating reference materials, certified values, and associated metadata to sustain data quality over time.
