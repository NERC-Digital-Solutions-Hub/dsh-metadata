# hydroscape_glasgow_xrf_cores_qc.csv

## Scope and purpose
- Describes the table of results from XRF measurements of standard reference materials during co-measurement of core materials.
- Purpose: ensure stability of the XRF instrument during operation and assess reliability of measurements for identifying elements (QA/QC).

## What is measured
- Measured values during runs are reported alongside certified values for the sediments.
- Key QA/QC metrics include: Mean of sediment concentrations across runs, Standard Deviation across runs, and Recovery (percent difference between measured and certified values).

## Key metrics and interpretation
- Recovery = (measured value − certified value) / certified value, expressed as a percentage.
- A recovery range of 95% to 105% is considered very good.
- For each reference sediment (JLK-1 and LKSD2), both measured and certified values are provided, enabling assessment of measurement accuracy.

## Data fields and units
- Run Code (UCL): Sample ID combining reference sediment type and date run.
- Concentration fields (elements and metrics):
  - Na%, Mg%, Al%, Si%, P%, S%, Cl%, K%, Ca%, Ti% (concentration as % dry mass)
  - V µg/g, Cr µg/g, Co µg/g, Ni µg/g, Cu µg/g, Zn µg/g, Ga µg/g, As µg/g, Br µg/g, Rb µg/g, Sr µg/g, Y µg/g, Nb µg/g, Ba µg/g, Pb µg/g
  - Mn%, Fe% (concentration as % dry mass)
- Elements are reported with both mean and standard deviation across runs for the measured samples.

## Reference standards and sources
- Ref 1: TERASHIMA et al. (1990). Elemental concentrations in nine new GSJ sedimentary rock reference samples (Geostandards Newsletter, 14(1)).
- Ref 2: LYNCH (1990). Provisional Elemental Values for LKSD-1 to LKSD-4 and STSD-1 to STSD-4 (Geostandards Newsletter, 14: 153-167).

## How this supports environmental monitoring
- Provides validated QA/QC data to demonstrate the reliability and comparability of sediment core elemental measurements over time.
- Facilitates standardized, transparent reporting for environmental health assessments and policy performance evaluations.
