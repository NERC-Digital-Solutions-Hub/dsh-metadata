# hydroscape_glasgow_xrf_cores_qc.csv

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes a table of results from XRF measurements of standard reference materials co-measured with core sediments.
  - Purpose is QA/QC: ensure instrument stability and reliability of element identification during measurements.
  - Supports monitoring frameworks by providing traceable, quality-assured data for environmental assessments.

- What the table contains
  - Measured values during the run alongside certified sediment values.
  - Mean and standard deviation of measured sediment element concentrations across runs.
  - Recovery values: percent difference between measured and certified values (measured vs certified), with 95–105% considered very good.

- Key fields and metrics
  - Run Code (UCL): sample ID combining reference sediment type and run date.
  - Reference standards: JLK-1 and LKSD2 (two sediment core standard references) with descriptions.
  - Measured data by element: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti (as % dry mass); V, Cr, Mn, Fe (as µg/g or % depending on element); Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb (as µg/g where indicated).
  - Descriptive statistics: Measured Mean and Measured SD for sediment concentrations.
  - Certified reference values: Certified values for each element in Ref 1 (JLK-1) and Ref 2 (LKSD2).
  - Recovery: %Difference between measured and certified values for each reference material.

- Standards and references
  - Ref 1: TERASHIMA et al. 1990 – Elemental concentrations in nine new GSJ rock reference samples (sedimentary rock series).
  - Ref 2: LYNCH 1990 – Provisional elemental values for LKSD reference materials (LKSD-1, LKSD-2, etc.).
  - Use of these standards to benchmark instrument performance and data accuracy.

- Data quality indicators and interpretation
  - Recovery range (95–105%) used as a benchmark for high-quality measurements.
  - Means and SDs across runs help evaluate precision and reproducibility.
  - Certified values enable verification of instrument calibration and method accuracy over time.

- Relevance to monitoring frameworks
  - Provides transparent QA/QC metrics essential for evaluating environmental health measurements.
  - Ensures data are traceable to certified standards, supporting data integrity and comparability.
  - Facilitates data governance by documenting measurement performance, enabling audit trails and quality assurance decisions.
  - Highlights metadata prerequisites (e.g., run identifiers, reference materials) critical for data sharing, consolidation, and cross-study reuse.

- Practical considerations for authors of monitoring frameworks
  - Ensure access to reference standards and accompanying certified values for ongoing QC.
  - Track instrument stability and measurement precision through means, SDs, and recovery metrics.
  - Maintain clear metadata (run codes, standard references, unit conventions) to support data verification and reuse.
  - Be mindful of data sharing barriers when QC datasets are relied upon for broader analyses.
