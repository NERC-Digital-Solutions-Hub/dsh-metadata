# This document describes the headings used to record the stratigraphic data collected for each core

- Purpose and scope
  - Defines the standardized headings (determinands) used to record stratigraphic data for each lake core.
  - Data are stored as a matrix of columns (determinands) and rows representing contiguous core-depth intervals.
  - Blanks indicate missing measurements.

- Data schema and key fields
  - Core and depth identifiers
    - Sub_ID: internal UCL Amphora database unique ID for a core slice
    - Top_Depth_cm / Bottom_Depth_cm: depth range of the sliced core section from the sediment/water interface
  - Physical and compositional measurements
    - Mass of sediment after drying (DW) and related LOI measurements
    - LOI 550 / LOI 950: carbonate and organic content via ignition methods (with Ref 1 guidance)
    - wetd: mass of 1 cm3 of wet sediment
  - Radiometric dating and chronology
    - Pb210_Total / Pb210_Supported / Pb210_Unsupported and their errors
    - Cum_Unsupported_Pb210 and its error
    - Cs137 / Cs137_err
    - Am241 / Am241_err
    - Date_AD: calculated year (AD)
    - Age_yr / Age_yr_err: age estimates via Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) model
  - Sedimentation metrics
    - SAR: sediment dry mass accumulation rate (g cm-2 yr-1)
    - SR / SR_err: sedimentation rate (cm-2 yr-1) and its error
  - Geochemical and elemental data (XRF)
    - Hg: total mercury (µg/g) via cold vapour
    - Na%, Mg%, Al%, Si%, P%, S%, Cl%, K%, Ca%, Ti%: element concentrations as % dry mass
    - V, Cr, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb: trace element concentrations in µg/g or equivalent units
  - Data provenance and metadata
    - Description fields (Description) accompany many determinands as references to dataset definitions

  - File naming convention
    - Uses water body identification number (WBID) and project code/name of lake and core location
  - Purpose of fields
    - Data blanks indicate no measurement for that interval
    - Sub_ID and Depth fields anchor each measurement interval to the core slice

- Data quality, interpretation, and use
  - Data are structured to support cross-core comparisons and metadata discoverability
  - Units and measurement methods are specified (e.g., LOI, Pb210 dating, XRF elemental concentrations)
  - Potential data challenges for data leaders include gaps (missing measurements), fragmentation across cores, and variability in metadata completeness
