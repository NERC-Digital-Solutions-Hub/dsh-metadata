## Overview
- Describes the table headings for results of measurements of reference sediment (LKSD2) and procedural blanks processed with core sediments measured by CV-AFS.

## Data elements (table headings)
- Glasgow Hg Core Runs: Name of Hg cores run through CV-AFS machine.
- Tube Code: Tube code (LKSD2…).
- Standard Sediment mass: Mass of Reference sediment weighed (~0.2 g).
- Hg ng/g: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as ng/g.
- Hg µg/g: Concentration of Hg in sediment expressed as µg/g.
- Measured blank (ng/ml): Concentration of Hg measured in procedural blank (ng/ml).

## Key values and materials
- LKSD2 Reference Sediment Value = 160 ± 19 ng/g.
- Partial Extraction using HNO3.

## Context and method
- Measurements conducted on core sediments using CV-AFS.
- Includes procedural blanks for quality control.

## Data stewardship considerations for Data Stewards
- Metadata completeness: ensure clear description of methods (CV-AFS), partial extraction (HNO3), units (ng/g, ng/ml), and reference material LKSD2 with its uncertainty.
- Provenance and traceability: capture file name, core run identifiers, tube codes, and calibration/QC procedures.
- QA/QC documentation: include procedural blanks, reference material values with uncertainty, and any data corrections.
- Standards and interoperability: maintain consistent units, naming conventions, and link to the Lynch (1990) reference for LKSD materials.
- Discoverability and sharing: index dataset in relevant data portals with clear descriptions and relationships to the reference material.
