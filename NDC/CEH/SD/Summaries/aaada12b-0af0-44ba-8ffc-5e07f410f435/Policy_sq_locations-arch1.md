# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim and scope
  - Aims to maximise public-interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data are publicly accessible.
  - Rolling 2019+ program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.

- Partners and context
  - 2007 CS partners include NERC (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, NE, WG, NIEA, SG, FC, SNH, CCW, etc.
  - Location data confidentiality supports sampling representativeness, landowner goodwill, and ongoing survey integrity.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Critical for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey.
  - Requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- When release and precision are allowed
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) can be released under licence to identify approximate square locations.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise) require very exceptional circumstances; UKCEH may process data to avoid direct release, but in exceptional cases release may occur under licence.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
  - In all cases, releases are governed by confidentiality safeguards and licensing terms.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorized individuals.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be kept beyond the license period.
  - End-of-licence declarations required confirming destruction of data.
  - No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality; consult UKCEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to show project-management standards equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; license terms still prohibit attempts to deduce precise locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
  - UKCEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
  - If approvals are denied, UKCEH supports decisions under statutory processes.
  - UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications and decision grounds.
  - Reasonable pre-processing support within CS partnership may be provided by UKCEH; other organisations handled case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential data users are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to use data covered by this policy. Assistance may be collaborative or paid, to be negotiated case-by-case.
