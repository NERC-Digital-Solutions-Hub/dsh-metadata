# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Purpose and context
- Documents the evolution of the Countryside Survey field sampling strategy and the ITE Land Classification used to stratify a national ecological survey of Great Britain.
- Emphasises the connection between past and current methods, and why current sampling remains linked to earlier approaches.

## Core concepts
- Stratified, random sampling to ensure samples represent different land types and ecological conditions.
- The ITE Land Classification: an environmental stratification system derived from environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to create land classes for sampling.
- Field surveys centered on 1 km squares (initially the primary sampling unit).
- Use of statistical design to estimate national, regional, and country-level habitat features from class-based proportions and square-level observations.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling (timeline)
- 1978: First GB ecological survey using ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) to define 32 land classes from 1228 centre squares; 8 squares per class surveyed (total 256).
- 1984: Second field survey expands to 12 squares per class (total 384); continues to use the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990: Countryside Survey 1990 uses an all-squares Land Classification (extended to cover all GB squares); 508 squares surveyed; Land Cover Map of GB linked to this program.
- 1998: Revised Land Classification to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to 40; total survey 569 squares.
- 2000: Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) introduces country-unit reporting (England with Wales and Scotland separately); sub-division and aggregation of classes to create 40 strata; additional samples to improve representation; uplands module added to improve England/Wales upland habitat estimates.
- 2007: Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) adds Wales-only reporting enhancements; creates country-unit versions of several classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added; adjustments in England to maintain overall representation.

## Sampling framework and estimation methodology
- The sampling framework is strata-based, with random selection within each land class to form a representative national sample.
- National estimates are calculated as: mean habitat area per square within each Land Class times the total area of that Land Class; results published in successive CS reports.
- Data outputs include maps of classified squares, counts by class, and tables detailing the number of squares surveyed per class and per survey year.

## Country reporting and classifications
- CS1990 used a single GB classification for national estimates; CS2000 and CS2007 introduce country-specific reporting (England with Wales, Scotland) with corresponding class subdivisions and aggregations to ensure adequate representation within each country unit.
- Adjustments include sub-dividing land classes into country-specific variants and aggregating rump classes when necessary to maintain robust estimates.
- Wales required additional Welsh-class subdivisions and additional squares to improve Wales-only precision; England adjustments were made where Welsh squares were removed.

## Uplands module and country-specific sampling
- A dedicated uplands module (CS2000) added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland areas of England and Wales to boost precision for upland habitat estimates.
- This supports separate country-based estimates by ensuring adequate sampling in under-represented areas.

## Welsh and Welsh-specific adjustments (CS2007)
- Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country in CS2007 to support Wales-only reporting.
- New Welsh country-unit classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
- Wales received 43 additional squares; two Welsh squares from earlier plans were re-allocated to England to maintain consistency in English class representation.

## Outputs and documentation
- For each survey, tables summarize the number of squares by class, country unit, and year; figures show sampling rates and geographic distribution.
- Outputs underpin national, England & Wales, and Scotland habitat estimates and trend analyses, with results published in CS reports (1990, 2000, 2007) and associated papers.
- Note on national estimates: changing the classification used for national estimates affects consistency; CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 decisions balance intra-survey consistency with cross-survey comparability.

## Key data considerations for data support
- Longitudinal linkage: current sampling is designed to be compatible with past classifications to enable time-series analyses.
- Representativeness: stratification and controlled sample sizes per class are intended to minimize bias and improve precision.
- Data products: classifications, square-level data, class-area estimates, and country-specific outputs enable flexible reporting and cross-boundary environmental policy analysis.

## Summary for data practitioners
- The document details a rigorous, evolving sampling strategy built on stratified random sampling within dynamically refined land classifications to produce robust, country-specific ecological estimates for GB.
- It explains how data are aggregated from square-level observations within land classes to produce national, regional, and country-unit habitat statistics, and how methodological changes over time are managed to preserve comparability while improving precision, especially for Wales and upland areas.
