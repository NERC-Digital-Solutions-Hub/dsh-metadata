# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview and scope
- Sets out how Countryside Survey (CS) square location data and spatial data within survey squares can be accessed.
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Funded by NERC for the 2019+ rolling program under NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK-SCaPE programme.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public interest supports confidentiality; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access, precision, and exceptional release
- Access allows determining if CS squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to indicate the 10x10 km grid containing a square.
- Six-digit grid references may be released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances under licence, with justification that the data’s IP protection level is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares could potentially identify square locations and is subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.
- If precise location data is essential, UKCEH-preprocessing is encouraged to avoid direct release.

## Licence terms and use restrictions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and access restricted to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for broader organizational use.
- End of licensing period requires written destruction confirmation.
- No release to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; consult UKCEH if unsure.
- Data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar but lower IP confidentiality requirements; but still prohibit attempts to identify precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by an authorised official.
- If approval is denied, processes align with the relevant Act and Regulations.
- UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- Within CS partners, UKCEH aims to support pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; demand permitting and case-by-case for other organisations.
- Partners are encouraged to consult UKCEH before committing to data use; collaboration or guidance may be available, possibly with payment negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for analysts
- UKCEH can perform pre-processing analyses to avoid needing location release, helping data use without compromising confidentiality.
- Engage with a scientific lead at UKCEH to define requirements and ensure appropriate use; collaboration or financial arrangements may apply.
