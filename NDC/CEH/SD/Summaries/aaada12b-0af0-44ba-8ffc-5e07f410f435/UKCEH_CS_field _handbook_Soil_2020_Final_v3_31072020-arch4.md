# UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020

- Purpose: a rolling national soil and vegetation survey to assess soil change over time by re-surveying former Countryside Survey squares and adding new ones; aims to understand soil function at national scale and serve as a research platform within UK-SCaPE.

- Scope and design:
  - ~500 squares surveyed over a 5-year rolling programme (about 100 squares per year).
  - Five X plots per square, randomly located within the dominant vegetation, away from field boundaries.
  - Soil and vegetation measurements taken from the X plots to enable soil change assessment.
  - Part of UK-SCaPE and supported by NERC award NE/R016429/1.

- Data collection design and core sampling:
  - Each X plot collects five 15 cm plastic soil cores: two white (storage), two grey (biology), one black (chemistry).
  - Cores positioned along the WEST line, 15 cm outside the central 2x2 m vegetation quadrat.
  - Peat/organic layer depth measured with an avalanche rod at three marked points; depth recorded in cm.
  - Cores are labeled and packed in a single bag with corresponding labels for each core type (Ada/Adb for white; Ba/Bb for grey; C for black).

- Core handling and sampling procedure:
  - Mineral soils: insert core, use knife to cut, hammer cores to depth, extract, cap (RED on top, BLACK on bottom), trim and bag, and note any issues (e.g., rocks, roots) in the field software.
  - Organic/peat soils: core handling adjusted; core may be placed on soil surface and cut around bottom edge if the core cannot be driven in; ensure soil remains with core; use trowel or pliers to free core if needed.
  - Very peaty/boggy soils: avoid compressing the core; use knife to cut around the bottom and push the core in as far as possible.
  - Scree/rocky soils: dig with a trowel where possible; if stones are too large, do not collect material; label as scree.
  - Surface vegetation: clear loose leaves/needles; do not collect fresh green material in mineral soils; record any unusual vegetation or obstacles.

- Post-sampling labeling and data capture:
  - After cores are sealed, scan the soil labels with a tablet (plot-specific headers in Vegetation Handbook); if scanning fails, manually enter or generate a barcode (CSYEAR SQXcore type).
  - If full 15 cm length cannot be achieved, mark the bag with a note indicating “short” or “comp” to aid lab bulk-density calculations and avoid misclassification.
  - Write the SQ number on the bag for frozen samples and indicate how many plots were surveyed.

- Core labeling and bagging specifics:
  - Core types and labels:
    - C (Chemistry): 1x long black core (15 cm x 5 cm).
    - Ada/Adb (Storage): long white core.
    - Ba/Bb (Biology): long grey core.
  - Bags for the five cores per plot are prepared and labeled accordingly.

- Data handling, storage, and dispatch:
  - Cores transported to accommodation or lab in a cool manner (cool box or small fridge) to maintain sample integrity.
  - Postage and lab submission guidelines:
    - Pack cores from the same SQ in the same bag; ensure leak-proof primary/secondary packaging with appropriate outer packaging (Tyvek envelope) and absorbent material if needed.
    - Do not post on Thursdays, Fridays, or weekends; refrigerate until Monday.
  - Destination and storage conditions by core type:
    - Black and White cores: Bangor (4 °C storage in a cold room).
    - Grey cores: Lancaster (freeze at -20 °C upon arrival); some workflows may route via Wallingford before freezing.
  - Post-lab transfer and storage: details on where and how cores are stored upon arrival at the respective labs.

- Data capture and workflow details:
  - Use a standardized lab workflow for entering measurements (e.g., peat depth, core depth relative to crossbar, notes on core depth if incomplete).
  - Record any anomalies (e.g., large roots, cow pats, boulders) with notes in the field software and on the bag.
  - After sampling, scanning of labels is performed; if issues arise, manual barcode entry is allowed.

- Equipment and field logistics:
  - Comprehensive field kit includes coring device, guards, knives, hammers, crowbar, trowel, scissors, extruder, rulers, gloves, markers, trays, cool storage, and transport supplies.
  - Acknowledges special equipment for peat sampling (avalanche rod) and tools to reduce core damage during extraction.
  - Clear procedures for dealing with challenging soils (scree, organic, or rocky) and for safely sealing and returning holes to field sites to prevent hazards for livestock.

- Forest floor and organic layer conventions:
  - Distinguishes litter and organic horizon categories (F, H) and provides guidance on identifying surface residues in forest floor sampling and peat/organic horizons.

- Appendices and contacts:
  - Provides lab and site logistics (Bangor, Lancaster, Edinburgh/Wallingford) for coordination and sample processing.
  - Includes figures and step-by-step visuals referenced in the handbook to support field teams.

- Key implications for Data Leaders:
  - Emphasizes end-to-end data governance: standardized core types, consistent labeling, and traceability from field collection to lab processing.
  - Highlights importance of metadata richness (depth measurements, peat horizon depth, notes on sampling conditions) for future analysis and comparability across years.
  - Underlines the need for robust data capture workflows (scanning vs manual entry) and clear data playback rules when scanning fails.
  - Demonstrates cross-lab data coordination (Bangor, Lancaster, Wallingford) and the need for consistent data formats, storage conditions, and post-lab data sharing.
  - Points to potential data quality risks (incomplete cores, labeling mismatches, inconsistent depth measurements) and the controls built into the procedure (notes, alternative recording, QC steps).

- Core challenges and considerations:
  - Ensuring consistent sampling depth and accurate depth measurement when cores cannot reach 15 cm.
  - Managing heterogeneous soil types (mineral, organic, peat, scree) with appropriate procedures to avoid contamination or data loss.
  - Coordinating cold-chain storage and shipping across multiple labs and facilities to maintain sample integrity.
  - Maintaining data discoverability and provenance across years and across partner labs through standardized labeling, barcoding, and metadata capture.
