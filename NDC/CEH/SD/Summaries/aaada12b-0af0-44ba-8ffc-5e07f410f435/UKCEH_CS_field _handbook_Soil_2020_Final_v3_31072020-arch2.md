# UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020

## Overview
- Long-term soil and vegetation monitoring platform as part of UK-SCaPE and Countryside Survey.
- Rolling 5-year program surveying ~500 squares (about 100 per year) to assess soil change and function nationally.
- Resurveys former squares from 1978 and selected squares from 1998 and 2007 to enable temporal comparisons.
- Data collected from the X plots within each square, enabling standardized environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessment over time.

## Sampling design and scope
- In each eligible square, five X plots are surveyed, randomly located within the dominant vegetation and away from field boundaries.
- Five soil cores per X plot (total per plot: 2 white, 2 grey, 1 black) taken on the WEST line, 15 cm outside the central 2×2 m vegetation quadrat.
- Core types correspond to specific analyses: Black (Chemistry), White (Storage), Grey (Biology).
- Cores are labeled and packed in bags with corresponding color-coded labels for each plot, enabling traceability and later data linkage.
- In forest and peat, vegetation surface material is cleared appropriately, with guidance on distinguishing litter and organic horizons.

## Field equipment and procedures
- Standardized field toolkit includes a coring device with interchangeable parts, knives, guards, multiple hammers, crowbar/wood muddler, trowel, trays, rulers (15 cm and 30 cm), scissors, pliers, extruder, and cooling/storage equipment.
- Avalanche rod used to assess depth of the organic (O) horizon in peaty soils at three star-marked locations; record depth if O horizon exceeds 2 cm (measure depth 20 cm beyond cores).
- If impediments occur (roots, rocks, large trees), document in software and adjust sampling minimally; if cores cannot reach 15 cm depth, record the depth from the base of the crossbar to ground and note on the bag.
- For organic/peat soils, alternative core methods are described to minimize compression and retain sample integrity.

## Core handling by soil type
- Mineral soils: insert core with hammer; ensure crossbar sits flush; extract and cap properly (red top, black bottom); trim and plate to proper length; if core partial, note depth and bag status (short vs compressed).
- Organic soils: core may not penetrate; place core on soil surface and cut around bottom edge; use knife to cut through roots; use trowel/pliers to extract without losing soil; avoid excessive compression.
- Peat soils: handle carefully to avoid excessive compression; may require cutting core with knife and pushing in; ensure bottom is level with core length; remove stuck soil using trowel or pliers.
- Scree/rocky soils: if core is not feasible, collect finer material with a trowel and label as scree; otherwise follow standard procedure and re-pack holes to avoid livestock hazards.

## Core labeling, scanning, and data capture
- Cores and bags are clearly labeled: C (Chemistry) – Black core; Ada/Adb – White cores (Storage); Ba/Bb – Grey cores (Biology).
- After collection, scan soil labels into the plot-specific data headers; if scanning fails, manually enter the barcode using a defined scheme (e.g., CS20(year)17(SQ)X1(C/Ba/Bb/Ada/Adb)).
- Record notes for any deviations (e.g., short or compressed cores) to support later lab measurements like bulk density.
- Clear surface vegetation and non-target litter; distinguish appropriate forest floor horizons (F/H) for organic samples and avoid pulling live plants.

## Sample storage, packaging, and post
- Store cores in a cool environment promptly: use a vehicle-based cool box or provided fridge for short-term storage at accommodation.
- Post guidelines: pack cores from the same SQ together in the same bag; ensure leak-proof primary (plastic core) and secondary (sealed bag) containers, plus sturdy outer packaging with absorbent material if liquids may be present.
- Timing: avoid posting on Thursdays/Fridays or weekends; refrigerate if necessary and post the following Monday.
- Lab destinations and handling:
  - Black and White cores: Bangor (UKCEH Bangor) and stored cold (4°C) upon arrival.
  - Grey cores (Biology): posted to Lancaster; frozen at -20°C upon arrival; Lancaster Environment Centre handles storage (with potential intermediate steps via Wallingford).
- Lab addresses and transfer notes are specified for Bangor, Lancaster, and associated sites.

## Data management and quality assurance
- All sampling and labeling designed to be consistent with standardized UKCEH Countryside Survey protocols to enable cross-year comparisons.
- Data entries include notes on unusual conditions (e.g., large roots, cow pats, boulders) and locations adjusted to achieve meaningful, homogeneous samples.
- Documentation includes explicit guidance on recording non-ideal samples (short vs compressed), soil horizon observations, peat depth, and plot-specific headers for integration into broader environmental datasets.

## Practical considerations and cautions
- Ensure sole sampling within X plots’ WEST line; keep samples clean and uncontaminated by surface debris or litter except as specified.
- Maintain sample integrity during extraction and transport; use trays to capture loose soil in challenging soils; avoid contamination from surrounding materials.
- Post-sampling, secure and label holes to prevent livestock injuries and preserve the sampling site for subsequent surveys.
- Forest floor sampling follows defined litter/organic horizon rules to ensure consistent horizon classification across sites.
