# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Scope: Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Aim: Maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Funding and partners: 2019+ rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme; original CS partners listed (NERC/CEH, NE, Defra, WG, NIEA, SG, FC, SNH, CCW).

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Protects scientific integrity of the sampling strategy and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest basis; requests for information handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Four-digit grid references: released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains the CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; applicant must prove that IP protection of related data/models is at least as confidential as CS data; UKCEH may preprocess to avoid release.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features): treated as equivalent to location data and released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licensees must: preserve confidentiality, store data securely, restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- End of licence: written confirmation that location data were kept secure and destroyed.
- No third-party release that could compromise confidentiality; data must not be used to visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases carry less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; a prohibition remains against attempting to derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Decision maker: UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) for exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If access is denied: process follows the Act and Regulations to support the decision.
- Transparency: UKCEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- Practical considerations: UKCEH aims to support internal CS partner use with preprocessing analysis within reasonable timeframes; external requests assessed case-by-case.
- Engagement: CS partners and potential data users are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to use data; involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
