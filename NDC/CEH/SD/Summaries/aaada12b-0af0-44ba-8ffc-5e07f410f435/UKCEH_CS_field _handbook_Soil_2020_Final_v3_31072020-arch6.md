# UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020

- Purpose: Standardize soil sampling and data collection for the UKCEH Countryside Survey to assess soil change nationally. Re-survey former Countryside Survey squares and add selected new squares as part of a rolling program (~500 squares over 5 years; ~100 per year). Five X plots per square are sampled, with soil and vegetation data collected to enable long-term analysis of soil function and change.

- Survey design and data context:
  - Five X plots per square, randomly located in dominant vegetation away from field boundaries.
  - 15 cm soil cores collected from each X plot; five cores per plot: two white (Storage), two grey (Biology), one black (Chemistry).
  - Cores positioned on the WEST line, just outside the central 2x2 m vegetation quadrat.
  - Cores and vegetation measurements feed into national-scale soil-vegetation datasets (UK-SCaPE platform).

- Equipment overview:
  - Core coring device with handle and crossbar; plastic cores; knives; guards; hammers (3 lb and 4 lb); crowbar/wood muddler; trowel; scissors; extruder; rulers; trays; gloves; markers; packaging and cooling equipment (electric cool box, mains and car cables, fridge as available).
  - Labels, bags, and per-plot label sets for core types (C for Chemistry, Ada/Adb for Storage, Ba/Bb for Biology).

- Sampling procedure (mineral, organic, and scree soils):
  - General steps:
    - Clear surface vegetation; avoid collecting litter or surface plant residues unless they are part of the defined soil horizon.
    - Use the corer to drive cores to 15 cm depth; if depth is insufficient, move points slightly and try again; if still not possible, record the height from the cross bar to ground and note in software.
    - If extraction is difficult, use auxiliary tools (crowbar or wood muddler) to minimize damage; if soil is loose or sandy, use a tray to prevent loss.
    - After core extraction, cap top (red) and bottom (black) as stated; seal in labeled bags with notes on any anomalies (short or compressed cores).
    - For organic soils where the core may not penetrate, place the core on the surface and cut around the bottom edge to collect the sample; avoid creating compression.
  - Mineral soils:
    - Core in upright position; drive into soil until cross bar is flush with surface; trim and label; if unable to reach 15 cm, log depth and note.
  - Organic soils:
    - May require placing core directly on surface; push and cut to collect soil; avoid compression; trim and label appropriately.
  - Very peaty or boggy soils:
    - Avoid full-core compression; cut the core as close to required size as possible.
  - Scree/rocky soils:
    - If the core cannot be obtained due to rocks, use a trowel to collect available fine material; label as scree; if stones are too large, omit collection.

- X-plot sampling layout and peat depth:
  - Five cores per plot laid out along the WEST line; peat/O horizon depth measured at three star-marked locations using the avalanche rod; record depths in centimeters (depth > 2 cm to be noted).
  - After cores are taken, measure depth of O horizon 20 cm beyond the cores when applicable.

- Cores and labels (coding and packaging):
  - Five cores per plot labeled and collected into a single plot bag with the following cores:
    - C = Chemistry: 1x long black core (15 cm x 5 cm)
    - Ada/Adb = Storage: white cores (15 cm x 5 cm)
    - Ba/Bb = Biology: grey cores (15 cm x 5 cm)
  - Labels per plot bag correspond to the above cores; ensure correct labeling and per-plot label set is included.
  - Post-collection: scan labels with field tablet; if scanning fails, manually enter the barcode or create a barcode using a defined logic (CS year, SQ number, X plot, core type).

- Data capture and QA in the field:
  - Record any issues (e.g., large roots, cow pats, boulders) as notes in the software.
  - If a problem occurs, move to a nearby location to obtain a homogeneous sample and log the problem.
  - Record the depth measured from the base of the cross bar to the ground when cores do not reach full depth; log as a short note on the bag to support bulk density calculation and avoid confusing with compressed cores.

- Forest floor and organic horizon guidance:
  - For forest plots, clear surface leaves/needles but exclude fermented or fresh litter as appropriate for the horizon being sampled.
  - Organic layer horizon definitions (F and H horizons) provided to guide sampling of organic material and to distinguish horizons before sampling.

- Post-field storage, packaging, and shipping:
  - Cores returned to accommodation or laboratory in a cooled environment; store in a cool box or small fridge as available.
  - Packaging requirements:
    - Primary: leak-proof plastic core
    - Secondary: leak-proof sealed bag
    - Outer: strong packaging with a surface at least 100x100 mm
    - If liquid is possible, include absorbent material between primary and secondary packaging
  - Destination labs and storage:
    - Black and White cores: Bangor (4°C cold room)
    - Grey biology cores: Lancaster (initially freeze at -20°C; later process steps may vary by year)
  - Postage guidance:
    - Post same SQ cores in the same bag; avoid posting on Thursdays/Fridays or weekends; refrigerate if needed and post on Monday
    - Ensure appropriate lab documentation (SQ number on bag; number of plots surveyed within the square)

- Documentation and labelling details:
  - Bags include core labels and accompanying notes (e.g., “comp” vs “short” cores for bulk density considerations).
  - After post-field handling, ensure all labels are scanned or manually entered; use a consistent barcode strategy when no barcode is present.

- Special notes and definitions:
  - Definitions for litter and forest floor material to guide what is collected with cores.
  - Horizon terminology guidance (F, H horizons) and sampling considerations for organic layers.
  - Floor plan and contact addresses for CEH sites (Bangor, Lancaster, Edinburgh, Wallingford) included for reference.

- Administrative details:
  - Version history and authorship
  - Publication and date context
  - Acknowledgements to supporting programmes and funders

- Data support perspective (how this aligns with data use and reuse):
  - Provides a standardized protocol to ensure data comparability across years and sites.
  - Explicit data capture practices (core type, location, depth, peat depth, notes) to support robust metadata.
  - Clear data triage and QA steps (notes for anomalies, depth measurements, and labeling) to maintain traceability from field collection to laboratory analysis.
  - Defined data pathways for sample handling, storage, and shipping to multiple laboratories, enabling reproducibility and auditability of the dataset.
