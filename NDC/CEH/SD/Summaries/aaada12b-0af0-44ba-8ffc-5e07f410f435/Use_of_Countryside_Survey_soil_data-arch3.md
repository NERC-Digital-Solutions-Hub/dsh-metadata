# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Purpose and scope
- Documents sampling design and methodological decisions used to monitor soil properties across time.
- Aims to detect significant change and inform policy decisions; provides guidance on data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
- Supports long-term monitoring through planned adjustments (e.g., rolling survey from 2019).

## Sampling design
- Historical sampling years: 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019.
- 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to 591 CS squares.
- 2019 initiated a rolling survey targeting ~100 squares sampled per year for five years, then repeated.
- Power analyses conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sample location and plots
- Soils sampled from CS x-plots within each CS square; five x-plots per square.
- X-plots are not replicates due to varying land-use/soil types; locations may shift if plots are destroyed or access is denied.
- Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1); repeats refer to the same general location within the square, with changes in exact sampling point (about 2–3 m apart) around a 2m x 2m plot.

## Sampling approach
- Depths: top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998, 2007, and 2019 used soil cores hammered into the soil and extracted; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Sometimes full cores could not be collected due to stones or shallow soils.
- In 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken for two of the four cores.

## Measurements and laboratory analyses
- 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998, 2007, 2019: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements.
- No chemical analyses are performed by soil horizon; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 and 2019 (not via ISO bulk density method due to core-size constraints).
- A detailed methods report and implications are provided (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Statistical analysis and interpretation
- Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields unweighted stock/change estimates.
- When land classes are weighted, results reflect national estimates of stock and change.
- Bootstrapping is not consistently used; appropriate analysis requires consideration of spatial structure.
- Recommended approach: mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within each CS square.
- Design-based perspective: widespread, dispersed sampling improves precision and regional coverage when spatial structure is not the primary interest.
- Users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and to review publications leveraging CS data (see CS website).

## Data quality, governance and dissemination notes
- The document highlights the importance of metadata, consistent measurement protocols, and transparent reporting.
- Acknowledges variations in measurement methods across years and the need to consider these in analyses.
- Emphasizes the value of clear communication of methodology for policy-relevant monitoring outputs.
