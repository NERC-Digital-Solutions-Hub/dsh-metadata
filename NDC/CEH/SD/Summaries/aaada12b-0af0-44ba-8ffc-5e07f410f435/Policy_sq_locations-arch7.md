# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Context and funding
- 2019+ rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), award NE/R016429/1, as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.
- Background partners (2007) include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, NIEA, SG, FC, SNH, CCW, and others.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and continued permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality aligns with public-interest objectives.

## When locations can be released (and level of precision)
- Access data may indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references (exact location) may be released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances under licence, requiring legal justification that the external IP/data is equally or more confidential.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could indirectly reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Licence concepts and restrictions
- Licences preserve confidentiality, require secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences for location data are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed after the period.
- No data/derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate JCOP-level project management standards.
- Four-digit releases have more lenient IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences, signed by authorized representatives.
- If access is denied, UKCEH supports the decision under the applicable Act and Regulations.
- UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising licence applications, decisions, and rationales.
- Reasonable pre-processing support within CS partnership is encouraged; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to data covered by this policy; UKCEH involvement may vary by collaboration or payment arrangements.

## Practical implications for GIS specialists
- You can use four-digit grid references to determine which 10x10 km grid a CS square belongs to, under licence.
- Access to precise (six-digit) locations requires exceptional justification and licensing, with strict confidentiality controls.
- Data handling must ensure secure storage, restricted access, finite licensing periods, and destruction after use.
- When integrating CS location data into GIS products, avoid features that could indirectly identify exact square locations unless permitted under licence.
- Consider coordinating with UKCEH early to assess feasibility and requirements for data access.
