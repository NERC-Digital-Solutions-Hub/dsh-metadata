# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Documents the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification, a stratified sampling approach developed over 30 years.
  - Aims to ensure representative sampling of Great Britain to enable robust national and country-level habitat estimates and change detection.

- Key concepts
  - Stratified random sampling to capture ecological and land-use variation across GB.
  - ITE Land Classification partitions land into 32–45 environmental classes, used as sampling strata.
  - Field survey units are typically 1 km squares; sampling design balances practicality with ecological representativeness.
  - National estimates are derived by combining class-level habitat metrics with the land area of each class.

- Development of the ITE Land Classification (historical progress)
  - Origin (early 1970s): Based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) rather than species, generalizing plant quadrat methods to 1 km squares.
  - 1978 (CS1978): First GB-wide classification with 32 classes derived from 1228 core squares; 6039 km^2 of classified grid surrounding centers; eight samples per class (256 squares total) for initial national estimates.
  - 1984 (CS1984): Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); sampling framework retained but representation issues noted.
  - 1990 (CS1990): Movement to classify every GB square (All Squares Land Classification) to support regional/local estimates; 508 squares surveyed; introduction of Land Cover Map linkage; classification expanded (40 classes) and urban/sea corrections applied; later comparisons showed only 62% correspondence with the previous framework, causing distribution shifts.
  - 1998: Revised Land Classification for CS2000; Scotland reporting introduced; class count increased to 40; adjustments to better reflect regional needs.

- CS1990: All Squares approach and its implications
  - Extended the Land Classification to cover all squares in GB, enabling regional and local estimates.
  - Resulted in substantial reclassification of squares and some distortion in class representation, informing later sampling adjustments.

- Developments for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Separate country estimates introduced (England & Wales vs Scotland) to meet policy needs.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; overall 40 strata expanded to 40–40+ in practice (40+ strata).
  - Additional samples added to ensure representation across new classes; specific adjustments to England and Wales numbers; Wales received targeted sampling enhancements (including a Wales-dominated class 17 subdivisions).
  - Uplands module introduced: an extra module with 30 squares to improve habitat estimates in upland regions.
  - Isle of Man samples replaced to align with country-unit reporting.

- CS2000: Sampling framework details
  - England & Wales combined sampling: 13477 total GB squares; sample sizes varied by class; final counts summarized in Table 2.
  - Totals: England & Wales samples increased to 366 (CS2000) from 311 (CS1990); Scotland samples remained consistent at around 195–203.
  - Emphasis on achieving adequate representation for each land-class in each country unit.

- Developments for Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further Welsh subdivisions (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added; two English classes were reduced to four squares per class to conserve effort, with modest expected precision impact.
  - Welsh-focused adjustments reflected devolved policy and environmental reporting needs.
  - CS2007 sample counts: England and Wales combined samples remained around 27–30 per class (example figures shown in Table 3); total GB squares surveyed in CS2007 surpassed CS2000 (569 total CS1990; 591 in CS2007 for GB-level totals).

- Upland module and Wales-focused reporting
  - An explicit uplands module was added to bolster accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
  - Wales received preferential sampling to enable Wales-only reporting and policy-relevant results.

- Data governance and national estimates
  - Note on national estimates: changing land classifications affects cross-survey consistency; CS1990–CS2007 adjustments were balanced by prioritizing country-specific reporting for policy relevance.
  - Historical tables illustrate how sample sizes per class evolved across surveys (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).

- Practical implications for Data Leaders
  - Base data strategy on a stable, evolution-tracked stratification system (ITE Land Classification) with clear versioning to preserve longitudinal comparability.
  - Plan for country-unit reporting when policy needs require England, Scotland, and Wales separately; anticipate class subdivisions and sample reallocation to maintain representation.
  - Incorporate modules (e.g., uplands) as policy demands change; ensure sampling design can accommodate targeted sub-samples without compromising core estimates.
  - Maintain metadata on changes to classifications and sampling design; monitor how reclassification impacts trend analysis and harmonization across time.
  - Ensure data governance around data lineage, sampling frames, and methodological changes to support transparency and reproducibility.

- Summary of the progression (chronology)
  - 1978: Initial Land Classification; 1 km squares; 32 classes; 8 samples per class.
  - 1984: Increased samples per class; 384 squares.
  - 1990: All Squares Land Classification; 508 squares; 40 classes; linkage to land-cover data.
  - 1998: Revised classification; separate Scotland reporting; 40 classes.
  - 2000: CS2000; separate country estimates; Wales subdivisions; upland module; expanded sampling.
  - 2007: CS2007; Wales-focused country units; five new Welsh subdivisions; upland emphasis maintained; 591 total GB samples.
