# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the sampling strategy and the ITE Land Classification over the Countryside Survey (CS) series from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasises a consistent, stratified, random sampling framework linked to an environmental land classification system to produce national, regional, and country-specific habitat estimates.
- Highlights governance of data through standardized classifications, documentation of changes, and decision rules for updating sampling frames and country-specific reporting.

## The ITE Land Classification: evolution and key changes
- Early development (1970s)
  - Bunce and Shaw developed a stratified ecological sampling approach using a 1 km square sampling unit and an ISA-based classification to group land into 32 classes.
  - Central squares of a 15 x 15 km grid were classified; surrounding squares were also assigned classes to create a robust sampling framework.
- 1978 Countryside Survey (CS1978)
  - Final frame: 256 squares (8 per class) across 32 Land Classes.
  - Field survey focused on vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat areas estimated by applying mean habitat area per square within a class to the class area.
- 1984 Countryside Survey (CS1984)
  - Expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total), reinforcing the need to reduce sampling error but acknowledging earlier design biases.
- 1990 Countryside Survey (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares; introduced “All Squares” methodology.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat quadrat sampling plus added land-cover mapping data.
  - Linked with first Land Cover Map of GB; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report (CS1990 vol.2).
- 1998 Revised Land Classification (CS1998)
  - Expanded to 40 Land Classes; allowed Scotland-only reporting within the national framework.
  - 569 squares surveyed; led to separate reporting for Scotland.
- 2000 Countryside Survey (CS2000)
  - Addressed policy needs to separate England & Wales from Scotland; introduced country-unit versions of Land Classes (40 strata after subdivisions/aggregations).
  - Added 19 new squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland habitat module introduced to improve upland estimates.
  - Wales-specific adjustments increased sampling in Welsh classes; Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates.
- 2007 Countryside Survey (CS2007)
  - Welsh reporting strengthened; Welsh sub-divisions of Land Classes introduced (five new Welsh classes, 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Strata increased to 45; added 43 Welsh squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class); England adjustments ensured adequate representation without expanding Wales’ sampling in some classes.
  - Wales became the most intensively sampled country; upland sampling further refined for Wales and England.

## Sampling framework and methodology
- Core principles
  - Stratified random sampling to minimize bias and ensure representativeness of ecological variation.
  - Land Classification (ITE Land Classes) used as the stratification framework to determine sample squares.
  - 1 km square sampling unit; centre square used for initial classification with surrounding squares assigned accordingly.
- Field survey progression
  - CS1978: eight samples per class; total 256 squares; habitat area estimates derived from class-level proportions.
  - CS1984: 12 squares per class; 384 total; refinement of estimates and methods.
  - CS1990: all GB squares classified; 508 sampled; added land-cover data and recreated national estimates on a broader classification.
  - CS2000: country-specific estimates introduced; adjustments to class definitions and sampling to represent England & Wales and Scotland separately; upland module added.
  - CS2007: further Welsh-specific refinements; expanded Welsh sampling with new Welsh classes; overall sampling rate and class distribution adjusted across the UK.

## Country-specific estimates and modules
- England & Wales vs Scotland
  - CS1990: national estimates computed from class means irrespective of country, prompting later country-specific framing.
  - CS2000: introduced country-unit reporting; sub-division and aggregation of Land Classes created 40 strata; additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation per country.
  - CS2007: explicit Welsh-focused subdivisions and sampling; England adjustments maintained precision where Welsh samples were fewer.
- upland habitat module
  - Added 30 squares focused on uplands and marginal uplands of England & Wales to improve accuracy for upland habitat estimates.

## Outputs, documentation, and governance
- National and country-specific results
  - CS1990 and CS2000 produced main national and country-based outputs; subsequent reports refined Wales-only and Scotland-only estimates.
  - Final CS2007 outputs include detailed UK results with Wales reporting enhanced for policy needs.
- Documentation and cross-survey consistency
  - Acknowledges that changing the Land Classification affects cross-survey comparability and stock estimates.
  - Recommends using the latest cancer classification for country-specific estimates, while noting that older classifications may be used for cross-survey consistency.
- Reporting references
  - CS1990: main report and vol. 2 (habitat data and maps).
  - CS2000: detailed scoping and country-unit reporting; upland module in CS2000.
  - CS2007: UK results from 2007; Wales-focused reporting and preparation notes.
