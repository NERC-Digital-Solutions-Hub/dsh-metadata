# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Introduction and aim
  - Documents the evolution of the sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification over 30 years, connecting Countryside Survey methodology across surveys to understand how change is detected.
  - Emphasizes stratified, random sampling and the need for representative samples to avoid bias.

- Core concepts
  - ITE Land Classification
    - A stratification system linking environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to land types.
    - Began in the 1970s with a 1 km square sampling unit and a 15 x 15 km grid approach.
    - Early classification produced 32 classes; later expansions increased granularity (40 classes by CS1990, 45 by CS2007) to support country-specific reporting.
  - Stratified sampling rationale
    - Stratification reduces sampling error by ensuring all parts of the population are represented, avoiding bias that pure random sampling could introduce.
  - National estimates framework
    - National habitat area estimates are derived by combining class-level results with the area occupied by each class.

- Evolution by survey year
  - 1978 – Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey
    - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used on environmental attributes for 1228 center squares to define 32 land classes; four surrounding squares also classified (total 6039 km squares).
    - 8 km^2 samples per land class; 256 squares total.
    - National estimates: mean habitat area per square in each class multiplied by the class area.
  - 1984 – 2nd Field Survey
    - Sample increased to 12 squares per land class (384 total); additional squares allocated to larger classes.
  - 1990 – All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey
    - Land Classification revised to incorporate data for all GB squares; urban and sea corrections; 508 squares surveyed.
    - 1990 Land Classification used for national estimates; repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats.
    - Began the move toward including data from all GB squares, not just a subset.
  - 1998 – Revised Land Classification & 4th Field Survey
    - Land Classification expanded to allow Scotland-only reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
    - 569 squares surveyed; national estimates aligned with the updated classification.
  - 2000 – Developments toward Separate Country Estimates
    - Recognition that England, Scotland, Wales (and Isle of Man) require country-specific reporting.
    - Framework adjusted to create country-unit versions of land classes; 40 strata expanded to 40 with country-focused subdivisions (ultimately 45 strata).
    - 19 additional squares allocated to ensure representation of new classes in each country; Isle of Man replacements implemented.
    - Additional upland habitat module planned to improve upland estimates for England and Wales.
  - 2007 – Developments for Wales-only Reporting
    - Wales required Wales-only habitat reporting; Welsh squares increased and country-specific adjustments implemented.
    - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit variants (creating 5 new Welsh/England sub-classes), increasing strata to 45.
    - Wales received 43 extra squares for Wales representation; England adjustments balanced the framework.
    - Wales-focused upland habitat emphasis maintained; England did not receive additional English-class squares.
    - Revised England-Wales-Scotland land-class maps and sampling framework (CS2007).

- Sampling framework and numbers (highlights)
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1990: 508 squares; all GB squares classified; 40 classes; groundwork for country-specific estimates.
  - CS2000: substantial restructuring for country units; ~40–45 strata; additional Wales and upland modules; detailed country-specific sampling numbers and rates (England & Wales and Scotland reported separately).
  - CS2007: further Wales-focused adjustments; 45 strata; 43 additional Welsh squares; sub-divided Welsh/England classes to improve Wales reporting; overall country-unit representation enhanced.

- Country-unit approach and adjustments
  - Separate country estimates introduced to provide England & Wales and Scotland results.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit variants (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w for Wales/England), with aggregations where necessary to maintain adequate sample sizes per class within each country.
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new country-specific classes; some English classes retained fewer squares due to cost/precision considerations aligned with scoping studies.

- Upland module
  - CS2000 introduced surveying an additional 30 upland squares to improve upland habitat estimates for England and Wales, reflecting policy needs and separate country reporting.

- Data interpretation and cautions for analysts
  - Changing land classification across surveys affects national estimates; consistency is favored within an individual survey but cross-survey comparisons must account for classification transitions.
  - National estimates can be produced using the latest country-specific classifications or the original 1990 classification; the report notes a preference for using the latest classification for internal surveys and the original for cross-survey consistency.
  - Country-specific reporting requires careful alignment of class definitions and sampling intensity to maintain comparable estimates across years and between England, Wales, and Scotland.

- Outputs and references
  - Results from each survey have informed national and country-level habitat assessments, with published main reports and summaries (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - The document provides a detailed historical appendix of the ITE Land Classification development and a timeline of surveys, highlighting how sampling and classification have evolved to support policy-relevant environmental reporting.
