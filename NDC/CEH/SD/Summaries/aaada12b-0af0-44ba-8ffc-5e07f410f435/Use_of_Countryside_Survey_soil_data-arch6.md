# Sampling design

- Purpose and timeline
  - A long-term soil sampling program with data across multiple years: 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019.
  - 2019 marks the start of a rolling survey aiming to sample ~100 CS squares per year for five years before repeating.
  - Power analyses (Emmett et al. 2008) informed the number of samples required to detect significant change.

- Sample location and structure
  - Soils are sampled from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 randomly spaced x-plots.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types.
  - Some plots are relocated over time (destruction, access restrictions); each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Repeat locations are treated as the same site, though exact sampling points shift ~2–3 m within a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

- Sampling methods and depth
  - Depths: top 15 cm sampled in 1998, 2007, and 2019 (8 cm for the invertebrate sample); 1978 used a soil pit.
  - Core-based sampling: soils collected with a soil core hammered into the soil and then removed (except pit sampling in 1978).
  - Some cores were partially constrained by stones or shallow soils; in 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were recorded for two cores.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998, 2007, 2019: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores carry different measurements.
  - Chemical analyses by horizon are not performed; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and 2019 (not using ISO bulk density method due to core limitations).
  - A full methods description and implications are provided in Emmett et al. 2008.

- Data interpretation and statistical guidance
  - Analyses must account for land class structure; ignoring it yields stock/change estimates for the population rather than national estimates.
  - When land classes are included, results are weighted by land classes to estimate national stock and change.
  - Bootstrapping is not always used; design consideration prefers a mixed model with square as a random factor to reflect multiple x-plots per square.
  - In CS design-based contexts, widespread, dispersed sampling increases regional precision and coverage, even when only one core per location is taken.
  - For analysis and interpretation, consult CEH prior to analysis and review CS publications listed on the CS website for prior data usage.
