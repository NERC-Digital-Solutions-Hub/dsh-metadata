# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.

## Scope, background and custodians
- The 2019+ CS rolling program is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under award NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK-SCaPE programme.
- 2007 CS partners include NERC (UKCEH), Natural England, Defra, Devolved Administrations, and several Scottish/Welsh/Northern Irish agencies and bodies.
- UKCEH acts on behalf of NERC and CS partners to manage access requests and licensing.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys and scientific integrity.
- Information requests are handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access: what can be released and under what conditions
- Four-digit grid references (indicating the 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence to identify whether survey squares fall within predefined areas (country, county, land class, environmental zone).
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only allowed in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, with justification that the external data or IP to be used with CS data requires equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit locations.
- Four-digit releases are governed by licence terms that are similar but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases.

## Licensing terms and user obligations
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and limit access to authorised personnel for the agreed purpose.
- Licences are issued for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at project end.
- Data must not be shared with third parties in ways that could compromise location confidentiality; it must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- For four-digit releases, terms are similar but do not require the higher IP confidentiality; licensees must not attempt to derive exact locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised official from the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, the decision follows the Act and Regulations, with supporting procedures.
- UKCEH reports annually to CS partners on licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Within reasonable demand, UKCEH may provide needed pre-processing support for internal CS partnership use; others are case-by-case.
- It is recommended that potential data users consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; collaboration or payment arrangements may be negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for data users
- Consider whether four-digit grid references suffice for your needs or whether an exceptional six-digit release is warranted.
- Prepare justification and ensure compliance with confidentiality, data-management, and JCOP-equivalent standards.
- Plan for the licence period and mandatory data destruction at project end; do not retain data beyond the agreed scope.
