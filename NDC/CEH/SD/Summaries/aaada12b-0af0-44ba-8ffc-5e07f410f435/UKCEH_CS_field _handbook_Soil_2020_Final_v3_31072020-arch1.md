# Soil Cores

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of the UK-CEH Countryside Survey to resurvey former Countryside Survey squares and track soil change at national scale.
  - Around 500 squares surveyed over a 5-year rolling programme (~100 per year); soil and vegetation measured only from the X plots in each square.
  - X plots are five randomly located subplots within each square, positioned away from field boundaries; data contribute to UK-SCaPE research platform.

- Sampling design and core types
  - For each X plot, five 15 cm soil cores are collected: two white (storage), two grey (biology), one black (chemistry).
  - Cores are taken along a WEST line, 15 cm outside the central 2x2 m vegetation quadrat.
  - Cores are pre-labelled and packed into a single bag per X plot with five core labels.

- Equipment
  - Core corer with handle and crossbar; hammer (3 lb or 4 lb); crowbar or wood muddler for extraction; knife for cutting roots; trowel; scissors; avalanche rod for peat depth; ruler scales; plastic sleeves, markers, and labels.
  - Storage and transport gear: trays for loose material; electric cool box or small fridge for field/storage; mains and car power cables; extension cables.

- Depth, peat, and organic layer considerations
  - In peaty/organic soils, depth of the organic layer (O horizon) is recorded using the avalanche rod at three marked locations; measure depth and record in software.
  - For organic soils, the core method may involve placing the core directly on the soil surface and cutting with a knife to capture material; take care to minimize compression.

- Field sampling procedure (minimally)
  - Prepare coring device, clean the tool, and insert the core by hammering until the cross bar is flush with the soil surface; extract core intact.
  - If depth is insufficient or obstacles (rocks/roots) prevent a full 15 cm core, record the height from cross bar to ground in the software and note on the bag as a "short" or "comp" sample.
  - Twist and pull to release the core; use crowbar or muddler if needed to avoid damaging the hammer.
  - For loose or sandy soils, use a tray to catch material and prevent loss; push core out, cap top (red), and cap bottom (black).
  - For very rocky or scree soils, use the trowel to collect as much material as possible; label as scree if stones prevent core collection.
  - After collection, remove surface vegetation as appropriate (do not collect fresh green plant material that isn’t part of the sample); label surfaces according to soil type (forest floor vegetation handled per guide).

- Labeling and data capture
  - Core labels per plot: C (Chemistry) – black core; Ada/Adb – white cores (storage); Ba/Bb – grey cores (biology).
  - Bags must contain all five labels for the plot; scan soil labels with a tablet after sampling; if scanning issues occur, manually enter the barcode or generate a code if no barcode exists.
  - If a full 15 cm core cannot be obtained, add a short or compressed note on the bag to indicate the deviation for later lab processing (bulk density estimation).

- Soil sample storage and dispatch
  - Transport cores to accommodation or lab in a cool storage box; store in a cool box or small fridge if needed.
  - Post/shipping guidelines:
    - Do not post on Thursdays, Fridays, or weekends; refrigerate until Monday.
    - Pack cores from the same square (SQ) in the same bag; ensure leak-proof primary (core), secondary (sealed bag), and outer packaging with appropriate absorbent material if liquids might be present.
    - Black and White cores: send to UKCEH Bangor (4°C storage).
    - Grey cores: send to Lancaster (freeze at -20°C); some paths may route via Wallingford for freezing before shipping.
    - Include SQ number on outer packaging and note the number of plots surveyed.

- Regional and laboratory logistics
  - Black and White cores (chemistry and storage) to Bangor; Grey cores (biology) to Lancaster; long-term storage and eventual shipping coordinated to labs in Bangor, Lancaster, or Wallingford as needed.
  - Temperature controls:
    - Bangor: 4°C storage.
    - Lancaster: -20°C storage (frozen upon receipt).

- Forest floor and vegetation handling notes
  - Clear surface litter (green plant material) except for material relevant to the sample (fermented/humic fractions); mineral soils require removal of top vegetation.
  - A guide to forest floor sampling (fermented vs humic) informs the interpretation of organic layer residues.

- Location details and documentation
  - Study sites are organized by square (SQ); X plots have a defined west-side layout relative to the central vegetation quadrat.
  - Documentation and references to related vegetation sampling handbooks exist for plot headers and data capture.

- Practical considerations and notes for analysts
  - If core collection encounters issues, record location and problem notes in the software for traceability and interpretation.
  - Ensure careful documentation of any deviations (short, compressed cores) to enable correct lab processing (bulk density calculations).
  - Maintain careful handling to minimize sample contamination and to preserve core integrity for accurate analysis across chemistry, biology, and storage datasets.
