# UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020

## Aim and scope
- Nationwide rolling soil and vegetation monitoring to assess soil change over time and understand soil function at national scale.
- Re-survey of all squares from the 1978 CS, plus a selection of 1998 and 2007 squares; ~500 squares over 5 years (~100 per year).
- Measurements taken from five X plots per square to capture variability within dominant vegetation; part of UK-SCaPE program.

## Study design and sampling framework
- X plots: five per square, randomly located within the dominant vegetation and away from field boundaries.
- Soil cores: five 15 cm cores per X plot (two white, two grey, one black) positioned on the WEST line 15 cm outside the central 2x2 m quadrat used for vegetation sampling.
- Peat/organic layer assessment: avalanche rod used to probe depth of organic layer (O horizon) at up to three locations; record depth if >2 cm.
- Core labeling and bagging: each core type assigned to a specific bag with designated labels; keep cores together in a single bag per X plot.

## Core sampling procedures and ground rules
- Mineral soils: clean corer, cut around roots, hammer to depth, extract core, and cap with red (top) and black (bottom) caps; record if depth is less than 15 cm and note any obstacles (rocks, roots).
- Organic soils: may require placing the core on the surface and cutting around the bottom edge; avoid excessive compression; use trowel to help extract and prevent loss of soil.
- Very peaty/boggy soils: core method may be impractical; follow alternative procedure to minimize compression.
- Scree/rocky soils: use available material or skip if too large; clearly label as scree.
- Post-sampling: cover and fill holes to prevent livestock injuries; record samples as “short” or “comp” on the bag to aid lab processing.

## Equipment and field logistics
- Comprehensive field kit: corer with accessories, knives, guards, rulers, trowel, extruder, levers, scissors, gloves, markers, bags, trays, cool box (vehicle or accommodation), small fridge.
- Depth measurement aids: 15 cm and 30 cm rulers; cross bar reference for depth.
- Cold chain: samples stored in cool box during transport; optional fridge for accommodation storage; maintain cold conditions until lab processing.

## Core labeling and sample organization
- Core types and labels:
  - Core C (Chemistry): long black core (5 cm dia, 15 cm length)
  - Ada/Adb (Storage): long white cores
  - Ba/Bb (Biology): long grey cores
- Labeling format: per-plot bag contains five labels corresponding to core types; each bag clearly labeled with cores and sample IDs.
- Documentation on bags: note if core is shorter than 15 cm or compressed; include SQ number on bag exterior; use notes to distinguish compressed vs short cores.
- Barcoding: scan labels with tablet to associate cores with plots; if scanning issues, manual entry or post-collection labeling possible.

## Data capture, labeling, and data flow
- Post-collection data entry: scan soil labels into the Vegetation Handbook system; or manual barcode entry if scanning fails.
- Plot-specific headers: follow plot header conventions to ensure correct association of cores with X plots.
- Per-plot tracking: ensure all five cores (C, Ada, Adb, Ba, Bb) are accounted for and correctly bagged and labeled.

## Storage, dispatch, and lab logistics
- Cold storage and transport:
  - Black and White cores: sent to UKCEH Bangor (cold storage at 4°C).
  - Grey biology cores: shipped to Lancaster; can be frozen at -20°C upon arrival; handling may involve interim steps from Wallingford to Lancaster.
  - Long white/black cores: routed to Bangor (per 2020 protocol).
- Packaging and posting guidelines: use leak-proof primary and secondary receptacles; outer packaging with adequate strength; include absorbent material if leakage is possible; avoid posting on Thursdays/Fridays or weekends; refrigerate if delay is anticipated.
- Post-processing destinations: Bangor, Lancaster, or Wallingford depending on core type; maintain cold chain during transit.

## Data quality, metadata, and governance notes
- Metadata emphasis: maintain surface vegetation clearance details, sampling depth status, obstacles encountered, and notes on core depth or compression to support bulk density calculations and lab analyses.
- Quality assurance: ensure cleanliness of coring device, proper core extraction, avoidance of contamination, and accurate labeling to maintain data integrity across time.
- Governance considerations: data sharing and public availability are facilitated by standardized labeling, digital tracking, and documented field notes; potential barriers include the need for robust metadata and consistent data management across centers.

## Key challenges and considerations for monitoring framework authors
- Field challenges: hard layers, large roots, rocks, peat-rich soils causing core extraction difficulties; need for clear notes in software and bags to explain anomalies.
- Data and metadata gaps: ensuring complete and consistent metadata (depth, compression status, sampling conditions) across years and plots.
- Data access and governance: coordinating data flows among multiple centers ( Bangor, Lancaster, Wallingford) while maintaining data quality and openness where applicable.
- Communication of complex procedures: detailed field protocols must be clearly communicated to field staff to minimize inconsistencies and ensure reproducibility.

## End-use and implications for policy monitoring
- Provides a standardized, repeatable method to monitor soil change and soil-vegetation interactions over time at a national scale.
- Generates multi-type core data (chemistry, storage, biology) aligned with a central data workflow, enabling integrated assessment and reporting.
- Demonstrates how to manage field data, sample integrity, and data governance to support transparent monitoring and evidence-based environmental decision-making.
