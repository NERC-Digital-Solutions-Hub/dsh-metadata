# Soil Cores

## Overview and purpose
- Documents the UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020 procedures for taking and handling soil cores and recording vegetation within former Countryside Survey squares.
- Rolling national program: resurvey ~500 squares over 5 years (about 100 per year) as part of UK-SCaPE, to assess soil change and function at national scale.
- Five X-plots per square are sampled per survey; soil and vegetation measurements focus on the X plots to enable longitudinal comparisons.

## Data collected and structure
- Core sampling: five 15 cm plastic cores per X plot (two white, two grey, one black) collected on the WEST line of the X-plot quadrat, positioned 15 cm outside the central 2x2 m vegetation quadrat.
- Core types and storage identifiers:
  - Core 'C' (Chemistry): one long black core
  - Core 'Ada'/'Adb' (Storage): long white cores
  - Core 'Ba'/'Bb' (Biology): long grey cores
- Depth and site data:
  - Peat/organic layer depth measured with avalanche rod at multiple marked locations; record depth in cm if O horizon exceeds 2 cm.
  - General site data include SQ number, X-plot number, year (e.g., 2019-2022), and plot layout (WEST corner).
- Sample labeling and handling:
  - Cores labeled and bagged with specific labels; cores scanned into field tablets or manually entered if scanning fails.
  - Bags carry plot-specific labels; “short” (incomplete length) or “comp” (compressed) notes added to aid later lab processing (bulk density estimation).

## Metadata and documentation standards
- Core labeling scheme and bag contents defined for consistent traceability (Ada/Adb, Ba/Bb, C).
- Bag labels and scanning procedures described to ensure linkage between field data and laboratory analyses.
- Explicit notes on unusual vegetation, obstacles (e.g., large roots, rocks, cow pat), and deviations from planned sampling location with notes in the software.
- Documentation guidance for forest floor vegetation and organic layers (green surface material not collected; organic layer sampling specifics).

## Data quality, provenance, and validation
- Procedures to ensure core integrity and non-contaminated samples (clean corer, careful extraction, use of tools to minimize soil loss, trays to prevent contamination).
- When full 15 cm depth isn’t achieved, depth from the crossbar to the surface is recorded and a short lab note is added to distinguish from compressed cores.
- For organic/peat soils, alternative sampling approaches are provided to avoid compression and preserve sample quality.
- Acknowledges potential sampling challenges (screes, rocks, deep organic layers) and prescribes alternatives with clear labeling to maintain data integrity.

## Data management, storage, and sharing
- Storage and transport:
  - Cores transported in a cool box (vehicle or accommodation fridge) to preserve sample integrity.
  - Post and lab handling guidelines specify temperature controls and packaging requirements.
- Core shipping destinations:
  - Black and White cores: Bangor, UKCEH (4°C storage) with specific postal handling instructions.
  - Grey cores (Biology): Lancaster; sometimes processed via Wallingford and then shipped to Lancaster.
- Data capture and integration:
  - Post-collection steps include scanning labelling barcodes into plot-specific headers; if scanning fails, manual entry of barcodes is allowed.
  - Documentation ties field data to a lab data pipeline, enabling integration with broader datasets (soil chemistry, biology, and storage metadata).

## Data lifecycle, versioning, and governance
- Version history shows iterative updates to the handbook (versions 1.0 to 1.8; latest 31/07/2020) with documented changes (e.g., addition of peat sampling, scanning process, sampling corner definitions).
- Clear provenance through authorship, dates, and change notes, supporting reproducibility and data lineage for stewardship.

## Packaging, validation, and safety considerations
- Detailed packaging requirements to comply with transport regulations (primary leak-proof core, secondary leak-proof bag, outer robust packaging; absorbent material for leaks).
- Instructions to cap cores (RED top, BLACK bottom) and to seal and label bags correctly to prevent cross-contamination.
- Post-hole closure guidance to avoid livestock injuries and to maintain field site integrity.

## Challenges and considerations for data stewards
- Variability in soil types and sampling success (organic, peat, mineral, scree) requiring flexible yet standardized protocols.
- Potential data capture gaps due to weather, equipment, or barcode issues; need for manual entry and robust metadata.
- Cross-site coordination across multiple CEH centres (Bangor, Lancaster, Wallingford) and maintaining consistent data formats, identifiers, and storage practices.
- Need for ongoing documentation of deviations, notes, and anomalies to ensure dataset usability and comparability over time.
