# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Describes the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification (stratified environmental classification) developed over 30 years to enable consistent, time-series monitoring of countryside environments in Great Britain.
  - Emphasises reproducibility, data quality, and the ability to generate national and country-specific estimates for policy and planning.

- Core concepts and methods
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage of different land types and ecological conditions.
  - ITE Land Classification as the principal stratification system, linking environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to land classes.
  - Use of 1 km squares as sampling units for field surveys; central squares selected within a grid, with surrounding squares allocated to classes.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) originally used to classify quadrats, then scaled to landscape-level environmental attributes for GB-wide classification.
  - Field survey focus evolves from vegetation and soils (1978) to land use, landscape features and habitat mapping (1984 onward), plus integration with land-cover data (1990).

- Timeline of development and key changes
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - 32 ITE Land Classes derived from 1228 classified central squares; 4 surrounding squares allocated to classes.
    - 6039 km squares classified; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class).
    - National habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class.
  - 1984 (Second GB survey)
    - Framework retained, sample size increased to 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
    - Expanded to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Land Cover Map (satellite-derived) linked to CS1990; results presented using the new framework.
    - Some reclassification of squares; national estimates still based on 1990 classification.
  - 2000 (Developments for CS2000)
    - Need to support Scotland and England/Wales country-specific reporting; introduction of separate country estimates.
    - Land Classes subdivided to country units (England with Wales; Scotland); 40 strata after aggregation/adjustment.
    - Additional 19 squares allocated to ensure adequate representation; extra upland habitat module introduced (30 upland squares) to improve upland estimates.
  - 2007 (Developments for CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements drive adjustments.
    - Welsh-specific class subdivisions created (five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure representation; some English classes reduced to 4–6 squares per class due to reprioritisation.
    - England/Scotland maps updated to reflect revised Land Class framework.

- Separate country estimates and sampling implications
  - CS1990 used GB-wide classes that crossed country boundaries; CS2000 and CS2007 formalized country-unit classifications to enable England with Wales and Scotland-only estimates.
  - Adjustments included sub-dividing classes by country unit, aggregating rump classes within a country when needed, and ensuring minimum representation in each country unit.
  - Revisions also addressed representation of Wales in the sampling frame and alignment with devolved governance and policy needs.

- Uplands module and policy-relevant enhancements
  - CS2000 added an uplands module (30 squares) to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - This supported better country-specific habitat estimates and policy reporting for upland areas.

- Data quality, reporting, and interpretive notes
  - The 2006 scoping study highlighted that changing the classification used for national estimates affects consistency; two approaches are possible:
    - Use the latest country-specific classification for current consistency.
    - Use the original 1990 classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - Preference for the latest country-specific classification for national estimates; the original classification used for cross-survey consistency where needed.

- Outputs and relevance for environmental analysis
  - A time-series framework linking land classification to field survey data, enabling monitoring of habitat extent, land-use change, and landscape structure over time.
  - Providing national and country-specific estimates supports policy evaluation, environmental reporting, and regional planning.
  - Data management emphasis: standardized procedures, clear documentation, and the expectation that datasets be stored and accessible via appropriate portals.
