# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Overview
  - Aim: maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
  - Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
  - Funding: 2019+ rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.
  - Partners (historical): list includes UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, NIEA, SG, FC, SNH, CCW, among others.

- Confidentiality rationale
  - Location confidentiality preserves representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
  - Requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Access and release terms
  - Allowed uses: data can help determine whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square.
  - Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must demonstrate that accompanying IP data requires equal/higher confidentiality than CS data.
  - Spatial data within squares: could reveal square locations and thus released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
  - Pre-processing option: UKCEH may perform preprocessing analyses to avoid releasing precise locations.

- Specific release conditions
  - Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences granted for finite periods and for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licensing period.
  - End-of-project: written confirmation of data destruction.
  - Prohibitions: no release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data cannot be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.
  - IP and governance: potential licensees may need to show project management standards equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases: similar terms but do not require the highest IP confidentiality; must not enable pinpointing exact square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - Decision-making: UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, approves exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - Denials: handled under the Act and Regulations with supporting reasoning.
  - Oversight: UKCEH provides an annual report on applications and decision grounds.
  - Practical coordination: UKCEH aims to support reasonable pre-processing analyses for CS partnership needs; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Guidance: partners are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; may involve collaboration with a scientific lead or negotiated arrangements.
