# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governing access to CS survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- 2019+ rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.

## Scope and rationale
- Confidentiality of square locations preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permission for surveys.
- Public-interest stance; requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and data levels
- Location data can be disclosed at varying precision:
  - Four-digit grid references (identifying 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence for helpful approximate location.
  - Six-digit grid references require exceptional processing by UKCEH; release only under licence in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances with demonstrated equal/higher confidentiality protection for IP/data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional-access terms as six-digit data.
- In some cases, pre-processing analysis by UKCEH may be requested to avoid releasing precise locations.

## Licensing terms and restrictions
- Licences for location data must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- Upon licence expiry, organisations must confirm that data remained secure and is destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties in ways that could reveal square locations or enable attempting to identify exact sites.
- The four-digit release licence has less-stringent IP-confidentiality requirements than the six-digit release.
- Potential licensees must provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP if requested.
- License terms for four-digit releases prohibit attempts to derive exact square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences reflecting policy terms; approvals signed by a senior authority from the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH follows FOI/Regulatory procedures to support the decision.
- UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS-partner use, pre-processing support is encouraged within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partner organisations are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; UKCEH may provide scientific leadership support as part of collaborative efforts or paid arrangements.

## Practical guidance for data stewards
- The policy applies specifically to location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- Maintain secure storage and controlled access; manage licensing periods and ensure destruction or secure retention as required.
- Coordinate with UKCEH early in the process to define requirements and whether pre-processing can meet needs without releasing exact locations.
- Ensure license terms are followed, including non-identification of square locations and compliance with JCOP-equivalent standards where applicable.

## Compliance and contact
- All license approvals and processing are managed by UKCEH on behalf of NERC.
- Annual reporting to CS partners provides transparency on access requests and decisions.
- For guidance and pre-processing support, engage with UKCEH as the designated scientific lead and data custodian.
