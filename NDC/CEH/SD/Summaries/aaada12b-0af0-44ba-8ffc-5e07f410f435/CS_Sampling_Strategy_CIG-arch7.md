# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- This document describes the Sampling Strategy and the evolving ITE Land Classification used to guide field surveys for Countryside Survey GB from its origins to 2007.
- Core idea: create a stratified, random sampling framework based on an environmental land classification, so samples are representative and enable robust, time-series estimates of habitat and landscape features.
- The strategy links with map-based data and GIS outputs, enabling spatial analysis of change across decades.

## Key concepts and classifications

- ITE Land Classification: an environmental stratification system that groups land into land classes based on factors such as altitude, geology, climate, and physiography.
- Origin and purpose: developed in the 1970s to ensure representative nationwide ecological sampling and to allow national and regional estimates of habitat areas.
- Early approach: classification of a subset of GB squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid) using a multivariate method (Indicator Species Analysis) to create 32 land classes; surrounding squares assigned to the same key classes to provide context.
- Use for sampling: samples are drawn from these land classes to achieve representative coverage across GB, with field surveys conducted in a single field season.

## Sampling framework by survey year

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey)
  - 32 land classes created from 1 km squares (center of 15 x 15 km grid).
  - Eight samples per class were selected (256 total squares) for vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
  - National estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per class with the total area of each class.

- 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
  - Employed the same sampling framework but expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384 squares, including the eight previously visited).
  - Focus shifted to land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to apply to all 1 km squares in GB (broader, still conservative revisions).
  - 508 squares surveyed; new land class map linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - All previous data collected, plus repeat vegetation quadrats from 1978.

- 2000 (Developments for CS2000)
  - Recognized need for country-specific estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and better upland habitat estimates.
  - Land Classification extended so every GB square could be classified; introduced country-unit sub-division of land classes and class aggregation where necessary.
  - 19 additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; additional sampling to balance England and Wales representations.
  - Special upland habitat module added for England and Wales to improve precision for uplands.

- 2007 (Developments for CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting prompted adjustments: sub-divided land classes into country-unit versions for England & Wales and for Scotland, creating 45 strata.
  - 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure adequate representation in Wales; two Welsh class sub-divisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - England adjustments: two English classes (5e, 15e) reduced to a minimum of 4 squares per class; overall precision deemed acceptable based on scoping study.
  - Total GB sampling numbers updated to reflect Wales-focused reporting needs; Wales and England received different class structures to support country-specific estimates.
  - Outputs continued to provide England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only, as well as GB-wide estimates.

## Country-specific estimates and upland module

- Separate country estimates
  - CS1990 and CS2000 frameworks allowed country-unit estimates (England with Wales vs. Scotland) rather than purely GB-wide estimates.
  - Land Classes were subdivided into country-specific versions; where necessary, sparse classes were aggregated within a country.
  - Isle of Man samples were replaced to ensure country-unit reporting integrity.

- Wales uplands module (CS2000)
  - Added a dedicated upland habitat survey module to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England & Wales, reflecting the need for country-specific upland estimates.

## Outputs and data usage

- Samples (squares) mapped to land classes to produce spatially explicit strata for analysis.
- National and country-level estimates of habitat areas derived by combining mean habitat areas per land class with class area, and by aggregating across country units as appropriate.
- Results published in successive main reports (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) and in Wales-only reporting studies as part of the CS program.
- Maps and figures (e.g., land classification maps and sample square maps) accompany outputs to support GIS-based interpretation and change detection.

## Notes on consistency and national estimates

- The 2006 scoping study highlighted that changing land classification schemes affects the consistency of national stock estimates; two approaches can be used: (a) latest classification for current surveys, or (b) original classification for cross-survey consistency.
- The document documents the evolution of classifications and the rationale for adopting country-unit classifications in later surveys to support Wales- and England-specific reporting, while preserving comparability where possible.
