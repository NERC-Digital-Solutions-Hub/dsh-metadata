# Overall sampling design

- Purpose
  - Data collected to address hypotheses about how the functional microbial community involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling changes seasonally and with geology.

- Sampling design
  - All measurements presented are paired (within a column).
  - At each site, 9 soil samples were taken within a 40 x 40 m transect at 20 m intervals.
  - Sub-samples were taken and stored differently depending on the analysis to be performed.

- Identifying information and metadata
  - Year and month of measurement; site.name (short site name with encoding for geology and river); geology (sub-catchment type: clay, chalk, greensand).
  - Rivers/locations encoded in site.name (e.g., GA2 = River Avon; CW2 = River Wylye; AS2 = River Sem) with provided coordinates.
  - Geology types include Chalk, Clay, Greensand.

- Data categories and key variables
  - Carbon
    - TOC: soil total organic carbon; units = mg TOC per g soil dry weight.
    - Method: sub-core dried at 60°C, homogenised; inorganic carbon removed with 2 M HCl; dried; TOC measured at 900°C using Shimadzu TOC-V.
  - Anions and cations
    - Analytes: acetate, fluoride, formate, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, sulphate, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium.
    - Units: µmol L-1.
    - Methodology: dissolved ions analyzed with a Dionex ion analyzer; samples collected from upper reach before sediment sampling; filtered (0.2 µm) and frozen; quantified against 7-point calibration (0–200 µmol L-1) using AS18 column with KOH/MilliQ eluents.
  - Genes
    - Target genes: 16S rRNA (bacteria) and functional genes including amoA (AOA and AOB), nirS, nirK, pmoA, mcrA.
    - Units: genes per g soil dry weight.
    - Methodology: DNA extracted from 0.25 g (wet weight) sediment; qPCR with SensiFAST kit; absolute quantification using internal calibration curves (102 to 106 copies); primers specified for each gene; standard negative controls included.
  - Methane
    - Methane oxidation potential (MOP); methane production potentials with H2/CO2 (MPP H) and with N2/CO2 (MPP N).
    - Units: pmol g-1 soil dry weight.
    - Methodology: 3 g of sediment incubated in serum bottles for 9 days with specified headspace compositions; headspace sampled every 3 days; methane measured by GC-FID with detailed instrumental settings provided.

- Temporal and geographic context
  - Seasonal variation is a study focus; sampling spans different times (month/year) across sites with varying geology and river influences.

- Data handling and potential outputs
  - Data are organized to enable cross-category integration (geochemistry, gene abundances, methane dynamics).
  - Structured to support self-serve exploration via dashboards or reports, with clear measurement names, units, and methodological notes for reproducibility.
