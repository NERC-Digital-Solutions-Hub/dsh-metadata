# Overall sampling design

- Study goal and design: At each site, nine soil samples were collected within a 40 × 40 m transect at 20 m intervals to measure key soil process rates and relate them to functional gene copy numbers, with attention to seasonal and geological variation.

- Sampling details:
  - 0–10 cm soil layer used for measurements.
  - Small soil cores collected with 10 ml syringes (distal ends removed) over the transect for rate measurements.
  - Sub-samples stored differently depending on the analysis.

- Process rate measurements (methodologies):
  - Soil water content and soil pH measured using Rowell (1994) methods.
  - Mineralization and nitrification rates determined by isotope dilution, following Kirkham & Bartholomew (1954); 15N-enriched incubation (40% 15N) with 3 g soil per exetainer (12 exetainers per treatment), incubated in situ temperature for 2 days.
  - Denitrification measured by a 15N enrichment technique; rates estimated using nitrogen isotope pairing (Nielsen 1992) with 3 g soil per exetainer incubated for 2 days.
  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) production measured by gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD), using 15N-enrichment approach as in Robinson (1991); similar incubation setup to denitrification.
  - Ammonium and nitrate extraction from soils using 2 M KCl; ammonium quantified by colorimetric analysis (Krom 1980) and nitrate quantified by ultraviolet absorption at 220 nm (John & Coletti; 2002). Extraction details include specific masses (8 g wet weight for ammonium; 4 g wet weight for nitrate) and centrifugation steps.

- Measured parameters and units:
  - Mineralisation rate: µg N g⁻¹ dry weight soil day⁻¹.
  - Nitrification rate: µg N g⁻¹ dry weight soil day⁻¹.
  - Denitrification indicators: in situ moisture and saturated moisture percentages.
  - N2O production indicators: in situ moisture and saturated moisture percentages.
  - Soil properties: pH; water content (%); soil temperature (°C).
  - Inorganic nitrogen pools: ammonium and nitrate (µmol N g⁻¹ dry weight soil day⁻¹).

- Data quality and governance:
  - Quality control and validation of measurements performed by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Lancaster.
  - Data management metadata explicitly defined (identifying information such as year, month, site name, geology, and river code) to ensure traceability and comparability across sites.

- Metadata and site identifiers:
  - Year and month of measurement; site name with encoding that conveys underlying geology and river identity.
  - Example codes: GA2 (River Avon), CW2 (River Wylye), AS2 (River Sem); geology indicators: C = chalk, A = clay, G = greensand.
  - Defined fields include: year, month, site.name, geology, mineralisation, nitrification, in situ and saturated moisture, N2O moisture, soil pH, water.content, soil.temp, ammonium, nitrate.
  - Data definitions specify measurement meaning and units (e.g., mineralisation and nitrification rates, moisture percentages, pH, temperature, ammonium and nitrate units).

- Context and interpretation:
  - Aims to understand how functional microbial communities involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling respond to seasonal dynamics and underlying geology, by linking measured process rates to gene copy numbers and site characteristics.
