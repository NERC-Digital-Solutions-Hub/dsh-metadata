# Overall sampling design

- Purpose and approach
  - Aim to understand how the functional microbial community involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling changes seasonally and with geology by measuring process rates that correlate with functional gene copy numbers.
  - Measurements are paired within a column and collected at each site to enable robust comparisons.

- Sampling design
  - At each site, 9 soil samples are taken within a 40 x 40 m transect at 20 m intervals.
  - Sub-samples are stored differently depending on the analysis.
  - Target depth: 0–10 cm surface soils.

- Process rates and analyses
  - Mineralization and nitrification: measured via isotope dilution method (Kirkham and Bartholomew, 1954).
  - Denitrification: measured by a 15N enrichment technique developed for this study; rates calculated using nitrogen isotope pairing (Nielsen, 1992).
  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) production: measured by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) following methods linked to estuarine N2O sources (Robinson et al., 1993).

- Incubation and isotope use
  - For denitrification and N2O measurements: about 3 g of 15N-enriched soil (40% 15N) weighed into each of 12 exetainer vials and incubated at in situ temperature for 2 days.

- Ammonium and nitrate extractions
  - Ammonium and nitrate extracted with 2 M KCl.
  - Ammonium analyzed by colorimetric methods; nitrate analyzed by ultraviolet absorption spectrometry (Krom, 1980; John & Coletti, 2002).

- Protocol specifics for extraction
  - Extraction: 8 g (wet weight) soil in a 50 ml centrifuge tube with 40 ml 2 M KCl; shake 10 s, roll 1 h, centrifuge, filter; NH4+ quantified colorimetrically.
  - Nitrate extraction mirrors ammonium protocol, with 4 g of soil and UV 220 nm absorption for nitrate.

- Data structure and metadata
  - Identifying information includes:
    - Year and Month of measurement
    - Site name (coded: first letter indicates geology; second letter the river; followed by a number)
    - Geology category (Clay, Chalk, Greensand)
    - Variables with defined units (e.g., mineralization and nitrification rates in µg N g-1 dry weight soil day-1; various moisture, pH, and temperature fields)
  - Example fields: mineralisation, nitrification, dn.insitu.moisture, dn.sat.moisture, n2o.insitu.moisture, n2o.saturated.moisture, soil.ph, water.content, soil.temp, ammonium, nitrate.
  - Unit definitions provided for each variable (e.g., µg N g-1 dry weight soil day-1 for mineralization and nitrification; % for moisture).

- Quality control
  - Measurements validated by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Lancaster.
