# Overall sampling design

## Overview
- Measurements are paired within a column.
- At each site, 9 soil samples are collected within a 40 x 40 m transect at 20 m intervals.
- Sub-samples are stored differently depending on the analysis performed.
- Process rates are measured to correlate with functional gene copy numbers, addressing how carbon and nitrogen cycling–related microbial communities change seasonally and with geology.

## Sampling design details
- Transect design: 40 x 40 m per site with multiple sampling points (9 samples per site within the transect).
- Focus on linking process rates to microbial functional genes to understand seasonal and geological influences on carbon and nitrogen cycling.

## Measurements and methodologies
- Soil water content and soil pH measured using Rowell (1994) methods.
- Mineralization and nitrification rates determined by isotope dilution, following Kirkham & Bartholomew (1954).
- Denitrification assessed via a 15N enrichment technique with incubations of ~3 g of 15N-enriched soil in 12 exetainers (12.5 ml) at in situ temperature for 2 days.
- Nitrous oxide (N2O) production measured by Gas Chromatography with an Electron Capture Detector, following Robinson (1999) methods related to estuarine N2O sources.
- Ammonium and nitrate extracted with 2 M KCl; concentrations analyzed via colorimetric methods (ammonium per Krom, 1980; nitrate per John & Coletti, 2002) and UV absorption (220 nm) respectively.
- Specific extraction steps: about 8 g wet weight soil per tube, 40 ml 2 M KCl added, shaking, rolling for extraction, centrifugation, filtration, and subsequent colorimetric/UV analyses.

## Variables and units
- Mineralisation rate: µg N g⁻¹ dry weight soil day⁻¹
- Nitrification rate: µg N g⁻¹ dry weight soil day⁻¹
- Denitrification parameters: expressed as rates under in situ and saturated conditions (percent moisture or related units as indicated)
- N2O production: moisture-related measurements (in situ and saturated)
- Soil moisture: percentages (dn.insitu.moisture, dn.sat.moisture)
- Soil pH: pH units
- Soil temperature: °C
- Ammonium: µmol NH4⁺ g⁻¹ dry weight soil day⁻¹
- Nitrate: µmol NO3⁻ g⁻¹ dry weight soil day⁻¹

## Data provenance and quality control
- Measurements validated by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Lancaster.
- Metadata and measurement definitions provided to support data reuse and cross-study comparability.

## Identifying information and metadata schema
- Temporal data: Year and Month (with definitions for date granularity).
- Site naming: site.name encodes underlying geology and river initial (e.g., GA2 = River Avon; CW2 = River Wylye; AS2 = River Sem).
- Geology: sub-catchment geology type (Clay, Chalk, Greensand).
- Variables and units: detailed naming for each measurement (e.g., mineralisation, nitrification, dn.insitu.moisture, n2o.saturated.moisture, soil.temp, etc.) with corresponding units.
- Geolocation: latitude and longitude values for site coordinates.

## Data products and potential use
- A structured dataset enabling analysis of links between soil properties, microbial functional genes, and biogeochemical rates.
- Suitable for integration with other data to explore seasonal and geological influences on carbon and nitrogen cycling.
- Supports data-driven insights into microbial mediation of soil nutrient processes and potential comparisons across sites with different underlying geology.
