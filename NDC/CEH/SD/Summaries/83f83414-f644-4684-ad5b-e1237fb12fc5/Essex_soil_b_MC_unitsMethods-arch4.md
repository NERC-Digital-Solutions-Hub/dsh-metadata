# Overall sampling design

- Objective: examine how the functional microbial community involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling changes seasonally and with geology by correlating process rates with functional gene copy numbers.
- Sampling at each site: 9 soil samples within a 40 x 40 m transect at 20 m intervals; sub-samples stored differently depending on analysis.
- Data aim: identify relationships between measured process rates and environmental/geological context to address the study hypotheses.

## Methodologies and measurements

- Soil water content and soil pH: measured using Rowell (1994) methods.
- Mineralization and nitrification rates: determined by isotope dilution; calculations follow Kirkham and Bartholomew (1954) framework.
  - Sampling: small soil cores (0-10 cm) using 10 ml syringe-derived cores.
- Denitrification: measured with a 15N enrichment technique; rates calculated via Nielsen (1992) nitrogen isotope pairing method.
  - Incubation: about 3 g of 15N-enriched soil (40% 15N) in exetainers, incubated at in situ temperature for 2 days.
- Nitrous oxide (N2O) production: measured by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector, following Robinson et al. estuary-based approach.
  - Incubation and enrichment as for denitrification (3 g, 15N-enriched soil in exetainers, 2 days).
- Ammonium and nitrate: extracted with 2M KCl; analyses per Krom (1980) and John & Coletti methods.
  - NH4+: colorimetric analysis after extraction; 8 g (wet weight) soil per tube.
  - NO3-: UV absorption at 220 nm after extraction; 4 g (wet weight) soil per tube.
- Sample handling: extractions performed with standard lab equipment (centrifuge tubes, Whatman filters) and typical lab workflows described.

## Data and identifiers

- Identifying information fields include year, month, site name, geology, and sub-catchment information to encode location context.
- Site naming conventions:
  - First letter indicates underlying geology type: C = chalk, A = clay, G = greensand.
  - Second letter is the initial of the river name; numbers distinguish sites (e.g., GA2 = River Avon; CW2 = River Wylye; AS2 = River Sem).
  - Geology field captures sub-catchment geology type (Clay, Chalk, Greensand).
- Measured variables and units:
  - Mineralisation and nitrification rates (µg N g-1 dry weight soil day-1).
  - Denitrification and N2O production, with in situ and saturated moisture contexts (percent moisture or related units as specified).
  - In situ soil parameters: moisture (%), temperature (°C), pH.
  - Extracted NH4+ and NO3- concentrations (µmol g-1 dry weight soil day-1 for NH4+; µmol g-1 dry weight soil day-1 for nitrate).
- Quality control: measurements validated by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Lancaster.

## Quality control and data governance

- Standardized methods and references ensure comparability and reproducibility.
- Metadata richness (year, month, site, geology, river, coordinates) supports data discoverability and reuse.
- Inline notes indicate alignment with established analytical protocols and quality validation.
