# Overall sampling design

- All measurements are paired within a column.
- At each site, 9 soil samples were collected along a 40 x 40 m transect at 20 m intervals.
- From these samples, sub-samples were prepared for various analyses.
- Data collection aimed to test how the functional microbial community involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling changes seasonally and with geology.

## Objective and sampling framework

- Study aims: address hypotheses about seasonal and geological influences on microbial processes related to carbon and nitrogen cycling.
- Sampling design supports comparison across sites and time, with standardized within-site replication to capture variability.

## Identifying information and metadata

- Year and Month of measurement.
- Site naming: a short site name; encoding includes underlying geology (C=chalk, A=clay, G=greensand) and river name initials; coordinates provided for each site.
- Geology: sub-catchment underlying geology type (Clay, Chalk, Greensand).

- Detailed methodological documentation (primers, protocols, and instrument settings) supports reproducibility and traceability for monitoring purposes.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks

- Demonstrates a comprehensive suite of indicators for environmental health related to carbon and nitrogen cycling and methane dynamics.
- Emphasizes standardized protocols, extensive metadata, and primary data generation approaches that support transparency, data sharing, and governance considerations.
- Provides a model for integrating chemical, physical, and genetic data to inform policy decisions and future monitoring decisions.
