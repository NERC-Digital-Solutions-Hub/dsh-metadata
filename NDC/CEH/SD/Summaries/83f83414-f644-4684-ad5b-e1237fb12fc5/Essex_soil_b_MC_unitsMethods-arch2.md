# Overall sampling design

- Objective and scope
  - Assess how functional microbial communities involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling vary seasonally and with geology.
  - Correlate process rates with functional gene copy numbers to address specific hypotheses.

- Sampling design
  - At each site, 9 soil samples collected within a 40 x 40 m transect at 20 m intervals.
  - Sub-samples stored differently depending on the intended analysis.
  - Measurements are paired within a column to enable cross-comparison of related variables.

- Methodologies and key measurements
  - Soil water content and soil pH measured using Rowell (1994) methods.
  - Mineralization and nitrification rates determined by isotope dilution; 0–10 cm surface soils sampled with small cores (10 ml syringes) for rate calculations.
  - Denitrification measured using a 15N enrichment technique; soils enriched to ~40% 15N, incubated at in situ temperature for 2 days in exetainers (12 per test) with about 3 g soil per exetainer.
  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) production measured by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD), following established estuary-related methodology.
  - Ammonium and nitrate extracted with 2M KCl; ammonium analyzed colorimetrically and nitrate analyzed by ultraviolet absorption (220 nm). Extraction procedure involves shaking, rolling, centrifugation, filtration, and standard colorimetric/UV analyses.
  - In addition to rates, in situ and saturated soil moisture for denitrification and N2O measurements, along with soil pH and temperature, are recorded.

- Variables and units (from identifying information)
  - Mineralisation: µg N g-1 dry weight soil day-1
  - Nitrification: µg N g-1 dry weight soil day-1
  - Denitrification: (rate; context includes in situ and saturated moisture as factors)
  - N2O production: (rate; per moisture state)
  - In situ moisture (%), saturated moisture (%)
  - Soil pH (pH units)
  - Soil water content (%)
  - Soil temperature (°C)
  - Ammonium: µmol NH4+ g-1 dry weight soil day-1
  - Nitrate: µmol NO3- g-1 dry weight soil day-1

- Identifying information and metadata
  - Data include Year, Month-Year, site name (encoded with geology and river identifiers), and geology (Clay, Chalk, Greensand) as sub-catchment underlaying geology.
  - Measured variables are annotated with units and data definitions in the metadata.
  - Quality control validation performed by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Lancaster.

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Measurements undergo validation by an established monitoring agency to ensure accuracy and comparability.
  - Metadata schema supports consistent interpretation across sites and time.

- Data management and accessibility
  - Raw and processed datasets are prepared with standardized definitions to facilitate storage and sharing through appropriate data portals.
  - Emphasizes standardized methods to enable cross-study comparability and integration with other environmental datasets.

- Relevance to environmental monitoring goals
  - Provides standardized, comparable process-rate data for carbon and nitrogen cycling across sites, seasons, and geological contexts.
  - Supports assessment of environmental health indicators and policy-relevant performance through consistent data collection and documentation.
