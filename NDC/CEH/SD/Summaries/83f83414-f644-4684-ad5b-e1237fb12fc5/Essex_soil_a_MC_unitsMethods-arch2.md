# Overall sampling design

- Purpose and scope
  - Measurements are designed to test how the functional microbial community involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling changes seasonally and with geology.
  - Sampling uses a consistent, paired design within a 40 x 40 m transect to capture spatial and temporal variation.

- Sampling design and data structure
  - At each site, 9 soil samples are collected at 20 m intervals along the transect.
  - Sub-samples are prepared and stored differently depending on the intended analysis.
  - Data are organized to support hypotheses about seasonal and geological effects on microbial function.

- Identifying information and metadata
  - Temporal data: year and month (date, Month-Year).
  - Site identifiers: site.name encoded with geology and river information; includes geographic coordinates.
  - Geology type: chalk, clay, or greensand (sub-catchment geology).
  - Coordinates and site-specific context are stored for traceability and portal uploads.

- Carbon measurements (TOC)
  - TOC units: mg TOC per g soil dry weight.
  - Method: soil sub-core dried at 60°C; inorganic carbon removed with acid; TOC measured at 900°C using Shimadzu TOC-V.
  - Data contribute to understanding carbon storage and carbon cycling potential in relation to microbial activity.

- Anions and cations (water chemistry)
  - Analytes include acetate, fluoride, formate, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, sulfate, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium.
  - Units: µmol L-1 for dissolved species; 0-200 µmol L-1 calibration range for many ions.
  - Method: water samples collected from upper reach before sediment sampling; filtered (0.2 µm), stored frozen; analysed with a Dionex ICS3000 ion chromatograph using AS18 column with KOH/MilliQ eluents.
  - Data enable assessment of soil water chemistry drivers of microbial processes and nutrient availability.

- Gene abundances (microbial functional potential)
  - Target genes include 16S rRNA (bacteria) and functional genes: amoA (AOA and AOB), nirS, nirK, pmoA, mcrA.
  - Units: genes per g soil dry weight.
  - Method: DNA extraction from 0.25 g wet weight sediment; qPCR using SensiFAST SYBR No-ROX; absolute quantification against calibration curves (10^2 to 10^6 copies); primers specified per gene.
  - Data provide insight into microbial groups linked to carbon and nitrogen cycling and methane metabolism.

- Methane-related measurements
  - Methane oxidation potential (MOP) and methane production potentials (MPP H and MPP N).
  - Units: pmol g-1 soil dry weight.
  - Method: incubations with headspaces of 80% CH4 + 20% CO2 (MOP), 80% H2 + 20% CO2 (MPP H), or 80% N2 + 20% CO2 (MPP N); 3 g soil in serum bottles incubated for 9 days; headspace sampling every 3 days; CH4 quantified by GC-FID.
  - Data assess methane cycling capacity and microbial oxidation/production under different gas atmospheres.

- Data handling, quality, and outputs
  - Data are collected and transformed following standardised methods to ensure consistency and comparability.
  - Outputs are prepared in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) for communication and policy relevance.
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals to enable access and reuse by others.

- Key challenges and objectives for analysts
  - Increase the value of monitoring datasets by integrating with additional relevant data sources.
  - Improve accessibility of underlying data to support transparency, reproducibility, and broader use.
