# ecosystem function and stocks data POINT_X

- A large, semi-structured data dump describing ecosystem function, stocks, and species richness across multiple sites on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, UK. The content mixes Schedule 3 Species Rich data with GRAZING LAND records, and includes various site-level attributes, coordinates, and sampling details.
- Core elements present across records:
  - Site identifiers and location data (SiteCode, LandUse, coordinates in decimal degrees and grid references, postcodes in some lines).
  - Sample metadata (Date sampled, Number of replicates taken, in = location descriptions such as AT EAST AT, etc.).
  - Dataset type cues (Schedule number 3 Species Rich, Schedule 1 Arable, Schedule 3 “GRAZING LAND,” Schedule 1 “LAND WILTSHIRE” blocks).
  - Observed values appearing as coordinates, site descriptors, and occasionally numeric measurements (e.g., numbers of replicates, longitude/latitude pairs, grid refs).
- Temporal scope (where discernible): multiple entries dated around June 2014 (e.g., 23/06/2014, 24/06/2014, 25/06/2014, 27/06/2014).
- Notable site names recurring across the dataset: STOKEHILL (Salisbury Plain), ENFORD (Salisbury Plain), CORNBURY FARM (Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire), IMBER, UPAVON, MANOR FARM, HILL 19, UPTON, and other Wiltshire/Salisbury Plain locations.
- Data content themes:
  - Species richness (Schedule 3 Species Rich) associated with grazing land and various land uses.
  - Grazing land records (GRAZING LAND) with associated site descriptors and positions.
  - Occasional “Schedule 1” entries with land-use descriptions and location descriptors.
- Observed data quality characteristics:
  - Highly inconsistent formatting and field ordering (fields like SiteCode, LandUse, Date sampled, Number of replicates, in, etc., appear in noisy, interleaved lines).
  - Repeated values and garbled text (e.g., merged phrases, broken coordinates, stray quotes, and partial records).
  - Missing or placeholder values (numeric fields with missing digits, dots, or blank entries).
  - Mixed representations of coordinates (decimal degrees and grid references) and inconsistent use of quotation marks.
- Implications for data stewardship:
  - The dataset would benefit from a rigorous ETL process to standardize schema (e.g., separate tables for Site metadata, Sampling events, and Measurements).
  - Establish controlled vocabularies and data types for key fields (SiteCode, LandUse, Schedule type, DatasetName, Date sampled, Number of replicates, Coordinates).
  - Normalize location data (convert grid references and postcodes to a consistent coordinate system; retain both grid and geographic coordinates with clear provenance).
  - Implement robust validation rules to detect and repair corrupted lines, missing values, and inconsistent field ordering.
  - Document data provenance, lineage, and any data transformations to support auditability and reproducibility.
- Data governance and sharing considerations for Data Stewards:
  - Ensure metadata is captured to support discovery and reuse (dataset title, abstract, spatial and temporal extent, methods, licensing).
  - Clarify data sharing permissions, disclosure risks, and potential embargo periods, given references to data availability and sharing limitations.
  - Plan for ongoing updates and versioning, with a clear process for uploading cleaned datasets to the catalogue and portals.
  - Align with organizational data governance policies for handling large, heterogeneous datasets and for interoperability with other systems and formats.
- Recommended next steps for custodians:
  - Create a canonical data model for Site, Sampling Event, and Observation/Measurement; map existing lines into this model.
  - Remove duplicates and extract clean records from the noisy text, preserving provenance notes.
  - Assign stable SiteCode and Dataset identifiers; separate Schedule 3 Species Rich records from Schedule 1 Arable and other blocks.
  - Generate a metadata record describing data collection methods, units, and date ranges; include data quality notes and known gaps.
  - Load cleaned data into a central data catalogue with versioning and access controls; set up an update mechanism for future submissions.
