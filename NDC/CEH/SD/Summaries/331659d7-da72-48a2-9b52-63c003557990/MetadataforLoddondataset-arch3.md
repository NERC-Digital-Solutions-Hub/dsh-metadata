# High resolution water quality and flow monitoring data coupled with daily and storm samples from the Loddon catchment (Sept 2017- Sept 2018)

- Purpose and scope
  - High-resolution water quality and flow data from Bow Brook (headwater of the River Loddon) in a predominantly agricultural catchment, near Sherfield-on-Loddon, Hampshire.
  - Timeframe: hourly high-frequency data from 08/09/2017 to 09/09/2018; daily laboratory samples 08/09/2017 to 08/09/2018; storm (hourly) samples 11/09/2017 to 22/01/2018.
  - Supplemented by daily optical scans and storm-event sampling for comprehensive water quality assessment.
  - Data types include physical parameters (flow, depth, temperature), chemical/matrix measurements (pH, conductivity, turbidity, ammonium), UV-Vis spectral data, total suspended solids (TSS), non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC), and pesticide analyses (12 pesticides).

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Monitoring site near confluence with River Loddon, in a catchment influenced by agriculture.
  - Sampling regime:
    - High-frequency (hourly) water quality and flow data.
    - Daily lab analysis samples collected around 09:00 GMT.
    - Storm event sampling with hourly samples during rainfall periods.
  - Data gaps noted due to equipment temperature-related failures and measurement errors; turbidity measurements began on 10 October 2017 due to equipment availability.
  -storm data: dates and number of samples per storm event documented.

- Collection, laboratory, and analytical methods
  - In-field equipment and setup
    - Peristaltic pump sampling with two flow-through cells: one with TriOS OPUS UV/VIS spectrometer (200–800 nm) and one with YSI 6600 V2-2 multi-parameter sonde (turbidity, ammonium, pH, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen).
    - Sontek IQ flow gauge for flow and river height at sampling point.
    - Sondes maintained and calibrated monthly; UV-Vis cleaned weekly.
    - Data download via TriOS G2 interface.
  - Sampling regime and handling
    - Daily samples and hourly storm samples collected with two ISCO 6712 autosamplers.
    - Sample containers: 300 mL in 350 mL glass bottles (avoid pesticide sorption to plastic); initial period used plastic bottles until 9 Oct 2017.
    - Transport and storage: samples refrigerated at 4°C and analyzed within 48 hours.
  - Laboratory analyses
    - In-lab measurements: pH (Mettler Toledo), conductivity (Mettler Toledo), turbidity (Hanna HI-93703), UV-Vis absorbance, and total suspended solids (TSS) via filter weighing.
    - NPOC (non-purgeable organic carbon) measurement using Shimadzu TOC-L with acidification and purging steps; selection over total carbon due to carbonate interferences.
    - Pesticide analysis (daily and storm samples): Affinity Water Ltd. lab using Agilent 6490 LC-MS, quantifying 12 pesticides with detection limits ~0.01 µg/L.
  - Data processing and quality controls
    - Daily and storm sample handling procedures described; standard calibration and drift checks for pH and conductivity; turbidity measured with wait times to allow particle settling.
    - 254 nm spectral scans performed in-field and lab-filtered scans (0.7 µm) for UV-Vis; blanks and drift checks incorporated.
    - Pesticide data quality governed by LC-MS method and lab QA practices.

  - Data accessibility
    - Data available at the BODC/NERC Environmental Information Data Centre: https://doi.org/10.5285/331659d7-da72-48a2-9b52-63c003557990
    - Citation required when using the dataset (authors and year provided).

- Data quality, limitations, and governance
  - Missing data and gaps
    - Some samples missing due to equipment temperature issues or measurement errors; turbidity measurements started later due to equipment delay.
    - Storm optical scans have some missing dates and selective sampling within storm events due to time constraints.
  - Calibration and QA
    - Regular calibration and drift checks for pH and conductivity; turbidity measured with specified standards; spectral data drift checks via blanks.
    - Spectral data requires drift correction for optical analyses; daily and storm optical scans include blank-corrected datasets.
  - Metadata and data structure
    - Comprehensive metadata embedded in data descriptions, including units, measurement methods, and instruments used.
    - Data organized into clearly named CSV files with explicit field descriptions and units to support reuse and governance.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation
  - Enables assessment of short-term (storm events) and long-term catchment responses in agricultural contexts.
  - Facilitates integration of high-frequency sensor data with lab-based analyses for robust environmental health indicators (water quality, nutrient status, pesticide loads, and suspended solids).
  - Supports data governance best practices by providing explicit data provenance, instrument calibration notes, sampling regimes, and licensing/citation requirements.
  - Useful for evaluating data availability, interoperability, and the practicality of maintaining high-resolution monitoring networks in policy contexts, including handling data gaps, metadata completeness, and standardized reporting.
