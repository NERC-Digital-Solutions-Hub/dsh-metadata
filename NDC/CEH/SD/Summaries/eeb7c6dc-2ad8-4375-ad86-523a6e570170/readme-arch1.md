## Data Organization and Naming Conventions
- Audible data: folders named yy_mm_dd_Gamboa or yy_mm_dd_BCI, indicating date and region.
- Ultrasound data: folders named Bat_yy_mm_dd, with yy_mm_dd matching the survey start date.
- For both types, the segment yy_mm_dd corresponds to the survey start date.
