# Audible and ultrasound recordings to survey birds and bats on Barro Colorado Island and in the Gamboa forest region, Panama, January 2023

## Purpose and scope
- A dataset of acoustic recordings collected in January 2023 in Panama to trial the ability of song meter devices to record audible and ultrasound noise for surveying birds and bats.

## Devices and capabilities
- Two acoustic devices used: Wildlife Acoustics SM4 (audible) and SM4Bat (ultrasound).
- Capable of long deployments (months) with configurable sampling schedules.

## Study sites and timing
- Four sites: Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and the Gamboa Forest region.
- Recording periods around sunrise and sunset between January 21–26, 2023.
- Audible recordings typically captured in windows around sunset; ultrasound recordings spanned daylight hours with offset around sunrise/sunset.

## Data organization and metadata
- Audible recordings organized into folders named yy_mm_dd_Gamboa or yy_mm_dd_BCI.
- Ultrasound recordings organized into folders named Bat_yy_mm_dd.
- The date segment (yy_mm_dd) corresponds to the survey start date.
- Metadata documented in a Metadata.csv file.
- For a comprehensive overview of file naming, see the dataset details on the EIDC catalogue.

## Data access and documentation
- Device and product information provided (SM4 and SM4Bat links).
- Detailed dataset description and naming conventions available via the EIDC catalogue.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates practical implementation of an acoustic biodiversity monitoring workflow suitable for policy evaluation and future decision-making:
  - Use of multiple sensor types (audible and ultrasound) to capture broader biodiversity signals.
  - Structured, date-based data organization to support traceability and reproducibility.
  - Inclusion of explicit metadata to facilitate data discovery, quality assessment, and reuse.
  - Linkages to external catalogues (EIDC) to standardize documentation and interoperability.

## Considerations for implementation and governance
- Data quality and metadata completeness are critical; the presence of a Metadata.csv supports transparency but ongoing verification is important.
- Data sharing and openness may pose barriers; clear governance around access, licensing, and versioning is advisable.
- Standardization across devices and sites enhances comparability and reduces transformation effort.
- Timely updates and maintenance of metadata improve verifiability and long-term utility.
