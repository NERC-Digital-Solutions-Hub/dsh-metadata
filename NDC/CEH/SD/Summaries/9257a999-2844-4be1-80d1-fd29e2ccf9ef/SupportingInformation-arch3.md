# Exotic Plantations Increase Risk of Flooding in Mountainous Landscapes

- Overview of the dataset and its purpose
  - Used to support results of the manuscript examining how land cover affects rain-runoff response, carbon sequestration, and nutrient/sediment discharge in mountainous landscapes.
  - Focuses on ecohydrology in the Upper Nilgiris Reserve Forest, Tamil Nadu, Western Ghats, India.
  - Data collection spans 2013–2016 (with dry-season data excluded); collaboration among four research agencies.
- Data components
  - DailyRainDischarge2014to2016.csv
    - Daily rainfall and discharge for eight small catchments with varying land cover in the Upper Nilgiris during May 2014–Dec 2016.
    - Rainfall measured with tipping bucket gauges (tips per minute converted to mm).
    - Water-level data collected via stilling wells with capacitance-based loggers; discharge estimated for most stations using velocity-area methods (except unit 101, which used a weir-based approach).
  - KSatLandCovers.csv
    - Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) under major land covers (Shola, Grassland, Pine, Wattle).
    - Data collected 2013–2016 using a mini-disk infiltrometer.
- Fieldwork and instrumentation
  - Rainfall
    - Tipping-bucket, wired gauges (Rainwise) deployed on ridges and grasslands in approximately a 1x1 km grid.
    - Data logged at 1-minute intervals; retrieved biweekly.
    - Calibration: yearly calibration at dry-to-monsoon transition; fixed-volume calibration to determine mm per tip.
  - Discharge
    - Water levels recorded at five-minute intervals in 11 streams using stilling wells with capacitance probes.
    - Discharge conversion:
      - Velocity-area method for most units.
      - Unit 101 used a compound weir with standard discharge equations.
    - Catchment boundaries derived from SRTM DEM.
  - Infiltration
    - Ks measured at multiple sites under patches of land cover using a mini-disk infiltrometer.
    - GPS accuracy around ±20 m for patches with dense canopy; coordinates provided as averages.
    - Sample sites included Shola, Grassland, Pine, and Wattle.
- Calibration and methods for data quality
  - Water level recorders calibrated per manufacturer instructions.
  - Rain gauges calibrated annually using fixed volumes of water; tips/mm determined from multiple trials.
  - Mini-disk infiltrometer used according to manufacturer manual; multiple readings per sample; discard readings with air-leaks.
  - Data quality checks included cross-verification with a permanent scale (benchmark against probe placement) and parallel salt-dilution gauging (slug and constant-rate methods) for discharge QA.
- Analytical methods and data processing
  - Data imported into R and aggregated to daily time steps; analysis scripts provided.
  - Processing workflow (examples of scripts and functions):
    - Tipping Bucket Rain Gauges: tbrg_nlg.R (master), myfuncts.R (core functions), data-specific functions (e.g., tips, fix times, import, gap-fill, aggregate), and control flow for sequencing.
    - Water Level Recorders: wlr.nlg.R (master), wlr_calib.R (calibration), wlr_import.R (import/calibrate/gap-fill), wlr_null.R (insert nulls), wlr_mergenull.R, wlr_aggreg.R (output).
    - Discharge Calculations: dis.control.R (master), dis.functs.R (rating-curve calculations, flume/weir options, plotting, NA handling), stn_101.R to stn_113.R (location-specific discharge processing), Readme_discharge.md, and disch_pyg routines when applicable.
    - Rating Curve Calculations: disch_nlg.R (master), useful.functs.R (utility functions), and related plotting/management scripts.

- Context and references
  - Data collected under collaborative ecohydrology projects and aligned with standard references and equipment manuals (e.g., Rainwise gauges, mini-disk infiltrometer, Dataflow capacitive loggers).
  - Research context emphasizes biodiversity hotspots (Nilgiris, Western Ghats) and integration of land-cover effects on hydrology and sediment transport.
- Practical implications for monitoring/framework authors
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: from field deployment and calibration to QA, metadata, data processing pipelines, and open scripting for reproducibility.
  - Highlights common monitoring challenges: data gaps, access and interoperability of datasets, and the importance of robust metadata to ensure data usability and verifiability.
  - Provides a concrete example of combining multiple data streams (rainfall, discharge, infiltration) to support ecological and hydrological conclusions, along with governance considerations for sharing data and maintaining data quality over time.
