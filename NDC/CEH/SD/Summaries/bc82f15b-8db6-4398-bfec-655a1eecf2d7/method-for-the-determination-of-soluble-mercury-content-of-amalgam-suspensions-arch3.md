# Method for the determination of soluble mercury content of amalgam suspensions

## Objective
- Identify the stability of mercury amalgam in various environments (distilled water, saliva, and bacteria found in waste pipes) at two temperatures (11°C and 37°C).
- Determine absolute mercury content using ICP-MS, with validation via a rhodamine derivative mercury sensor (fluorimeter).
- Obtain measurements at multiple time points: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.

## Experimental design and environments
- Environments studied:
  - Distilled water
  - Saliva
  - Effluent waste amalgam (representing waste-processing context)
- Temperature conditions: 11°C and 37°C
- Endpoint measurements: mercury content via ICP-MS and luminescence via rhodamine-based sensor.

## Materials
- Amalgam source: 3 GS-80 spherical amalgam capsules per setup (each capsule contains Hg 456 mg, Ag 336 mg, Sn 174 mg, Cu 90 mg)
- Sample media: 100 mL per environment (distilled water, saliva, or distilled water with waste sludge)
- Additional: Duran bottles, filtration materials, and luminescence/spectrometry apparatus

## Procedures
- Distilled water
  - Triturate 3 amalgam capsules; remove amalgam spills and grind to powder.
  - Add to 100 mL distilled water; seal in a Duran bottle; incubate at 37°C or 11°C.
  - Process 3 mL of supernatant: filter; allocate 1 mL for ICP-MS and 2 mL for luminescence analysis.
- Saliva
  - Collect 100 mL saliva; centrifuge at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes; filter supernatant (5 µm).
  - Triturate 3 amalgam capsules; grind; add to 100 mL saliva; seal and incubate at 37°C or 11°C.
  - Process 3 mL supernatant: filter; allocate 1 mL for ICP-MS and 2 mL for luminescence analysis.
- Effluent waste amalgam
  - Add 3168 mg waste dental amalgam sludge to 100 mL distilled water; seal and incubate at 37°C or 11°C.
  - Process 3 mL of supernatant: filter; allocate 1 mL for ICP-MS and 2 mL for luminescence analysis.
