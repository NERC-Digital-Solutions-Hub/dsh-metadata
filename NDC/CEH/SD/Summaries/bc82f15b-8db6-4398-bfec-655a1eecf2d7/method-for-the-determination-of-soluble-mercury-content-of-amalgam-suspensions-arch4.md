# Method for the determination of soluble mercury content of amalgam suspensions

## Objective
- Determine the stability and soluble mercury content of amalgam suspensions in distilled water, saliva, and bacteria from waste pipes.
- Compare measurements at two temperatures (11°C and 37°C) over multiple time points.
- Quantify mercury using ICP-MS and validate with a rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor via fluorimetry.

## Data assets and measurements
- Primary measurements: mercury concentration from ICP-MS; luminescence/readings from rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor.
- Supporting data: sample type (distilled water, saliva, effluent waste amalgam), incubation temperature (11°C, 37°C), timepoint (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months).
- Metadata to capture: lot/batch of amalgam capsules (3 capsules per batch; composition: Hg 456 mg, Ag 336 mg, Sn 174 mg, Cu 90 mg per capsule), sample preparation steps, and volumes used for analysis (3 mL supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence).

## Experimental workflow and data collection
- Capsule preparation: triturate 3 GS-80 spherical amalgam capsules; ground spills used for experiments.
- Distilled water setup: 100 mL distilled water with ground amalgam; incubate at 11°C or 37°C; collect 3 mL supernatant for filtration and analysis.
- Saliva setup: collect 100 mL saliva, centrifuge, filter supernatant; add ground amalgam; incubate at 11°C or 37°C; collect 3 mL supernatant for filtration and analysis.
- Effluent waste amalgam setup: 3168 mg waste amalgam in 100 mL distilled water; incubate at 11°C or 37°C; collect 3 mL supernatant for filtration and analysis.

## Sample environments and preparation
- Environments studied: distilled water, human saliva, and effluent waste amalgam (bacteria in waste pipes context).
- Preparation steps include grinding amalgam spills, mixing with medium, filtration, and incubation at specified temperatures.

## Instrumentation and analysis
- Indirect mercury quantification: ICP-MS.
- Validation/alternative measurement: luminescence via rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor using a fluorimeter.

## Data timeline and sampling plan
- Timepoints for data collection: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.
- Analyses performed at each timepoint for all environments and temperatures.

## Metadata, data quality, and governance
- Essential metadata: sample type, incubation temperature, timepoint, capsule batch/composition, preparation method, filtration details, dilution/volume specifics, and instrument settings/calibration references.
- Data quality considerations: cross-validation between ICP-MS and luminescence measurements; need for calibration and controls (not detailed in the protocol but advisable).
- Data management implications: centralized recording of measurements and metadata to enable traceability across environments, temperatures, and timepoints.

## Data access, reuse, and collaboration
- Data can support comparative analyses of mercury solubility across environments and temperatures over time.
- Reproducibility relies on detailed metadata, clear documentation of batch/lots, and standardized data formats to facilitate sharing and cross-institution collaboration.
