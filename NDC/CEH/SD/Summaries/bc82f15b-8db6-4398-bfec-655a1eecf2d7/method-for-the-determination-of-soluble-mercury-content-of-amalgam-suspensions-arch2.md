# Method for the determination of soluble mercury content of amalgam suspensions

## Aim
- Identify the stability of mercury amalgam in different environments (distilled water, saliva, and bacteria in waste pipes) at two temperatures (11°C and 37°C).
- Determine absolute mercury content in solutions using ICP-MS and validate with a rhodamine derivative mercury sensor via fluorimetry.
- Collect data at multiple time points: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.

## Study design and analytical approach
- Analytical methods:
  - Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for absolute mercury content.
  - Rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor measured by fluorimeter for cross-check/verification.
- Data outputs anticipated: absolute mercury concentrations and luminescence-based readings across matrices and time points.

## Sample environments and preparation
- Distilled water
  - Materials: 3 GS-80 spherical amalgam capsules (per capsule: Hg 456 mg, Ag 336 mg, Sn 174 mg, Cu 90 mg).
  - Procedure: Triturate capsules, remove amalgam spills, grind to powder, add to 100 mL distilled water, seal in a Duran bottle, incubate at 37°C or 11°C.
  - Measurements: 3 mL of supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.
- Saliva
  - Materials: 100 mL saliva collected; 3 GS-80 capsules as above.
  - Procedure: Centrifuge saliva (10,000 rpm, 10 min), filter supernatant (5 μm), triturate amalgam, add to 100 mL saliva, seal, incubate at 37°C or 11°C.
  - Measurements: 3 mL of supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.
- Effluent waste amalgam
  - Materials: 3168 mg waste dental amalgam sludge; 100 mL distilled water.
  - Procedure: Add to water, seal, incubate at 37°C or 11°C.
  - Measurements: 3 mL of supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.

## Time points and temperature conditions
- Time points: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months.
- Temperatures: 11°C and 37°C.

## Data management and reporting
- Data workflow aligned with environmental monitoring practices:
  - Verify and quality-assure data, clean and transform datasets.
  - Present outputs in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) for policy and health-safety scrutiny.
  - Store and upload datasets to appropriate data portals for accessibility and reuse.
- Challenges and opportunities for analysts:
  - Increase value by integrating these datasets with related environmental data.
  - Improve accessibility of underlying data used to generate outputs.
