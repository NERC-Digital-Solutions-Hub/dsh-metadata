# Calibration of a Mercury (II) Sensor Using Fluorimeter with HgCl2/HgNO3 and ICP-MS Validation

- Purpose
  - Describe dataset files for calibrating a sensor for mercury(II) ions using a fluorimeter with HgCl2 or HgNO3.
  - Explore how varying sample conditions (sensor concentration, water/methanol co-solvent, and acidity) affect sensor response and calibration.
  - Enable measurement of unknown Hg(II) concentrations via a linear calibration relationship.

- Data and measurement approach
  - Fluorimeter-based calibration: luminescent response excited at 500 nm to different Hg(II) concentrations.
  - Calibration outcome: a linear relation between Hg(II) concentration and sensor luminescence, allowing quantification of unknown samples.
  - Supporting materials: calibration graphs derived from raw fluorimeter data provided in a PowerPoint file.

- Sensor and solvent conditions tested
  - Sensor concentrations varied; solvents included water with methanol as a co-solvent to aid probe solubility.
  - Acid effect assessed using nitric acid to maintain stability of HgNO3 as an analyte.
  - File naming reflects tested sensor concentration and water:methanol ratios.

- Real-sample testing
  - Dental samples (clinical and amalgam) tested using a 1 µM sensor to assess measurable responses in:
    - Saliva
    - Distilled water
    - Amalgam separator supernatant

- Validation and cross-check with ICP-MS
  - Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) data provided to:
    - Validate the sensor calibration
    - Monitor soluble mercury content in dental amalgam samples
  - Conditions for validation samples: suspensions held at either 11°C or 37°C in water and saliva
  - Data handling: supernatants filtered and measured by ICP-MS to generate reported data

- Data governance and sharing considerations (as applicable to monitoring frameworks)
  - Calibration and validation datasets are described as separate data components (raw fluorimeter data, calibration graphs, and ICP-MS measurements).
  - Notes imply the importance of metadata (sample media, solvent ratios, concentrations, temperature) for reproducibility and verification.
  - Public sharing of underlying data may be constrained by the need to accompany with metadata and provenance to ensure quality and traceability.

- Relevance to environmental health monitoring
  - Demonstrates an integrated approach to environmental mercury monitoring by combining sensor-based measurements with independent ICP-MS validation.
  - Includes real-world media (saliva, amalgam-related samples) to reflect potential exposure pathways.
  - Illustrates how method calibration, media effects, and temperature can influence data quality and interpretation in monitoring frameworks.
