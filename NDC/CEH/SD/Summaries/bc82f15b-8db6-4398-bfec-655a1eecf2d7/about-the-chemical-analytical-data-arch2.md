# These dataset files show the calibration of a sensor for mercury (II) ions using a Fluorimeter and either HgCl2 or HgNO3.

## Overview
- Purpose: calibrate a fluorescence-based sensor for Hg2+ and provide a basis to measure unknown mercury concentrations.
- Validation: use ICP-MS data to validate sensor calibration and monitor soluble mercury in dental amalgam samples.

## Methods and Experimental Conditions
- Instrumentation: Fluorimeter with excitation at 500 nm to measure luminescent response.
- Reagents: Mercury(II) supplied as HgCl2 or HgNO3.
- Sensor and solvent conditions: Tested a range of sensor concentrations and water:methanol co-solvent ratios (methanol to aid probe solubility); nitric acid tested for its effect on the stability/sensitivity of HgNO3.
- Data organization: Calibration datasets comprise raw fluorimeter measurements; corresponding calibration graphs are provided in a PowerPoint file.
- File metadata: Filenames indicate the tested sensor concentration and the water:methanol ratio.

## Calibration and Data Analysis
- Calibration approach: Establish a linear relationship between luminescent response and Hg(II) concentration to enable measurement of unknown samples.
- Outputs: Calibration graphs (linear fits) linked to each dataset.

## Real-world Samples and Media
- Sample testing: A 1 μM sensor is used to assess measurable responses to real mercury samples in different media.
- Media tested: Saliva, distilled water, and amalgam separator supernatant.

## ICP-MS Validation and Mercury Monitoring
- ICP-MS role: Validate sensor calibration and monitor soluble mercury in dental amalgam samples.
- Experimental conditions: Amalgam samples held in water or saliva at 11°C or 37°C.
- Sample processing: Supernatants filtered and measured by ICP-MS to provide reported data.

## Data Management and Accessibility
- Data formats: Raw fluorimeter data and calibration graphs (PowerPoint).
- Metadata: File naming encodes sensor concentration and solvent ratio, aiding standardization and traceability.
- Data goals: Store and upload datasets to appropriate portals and enable access to underlying data to support broader analyses.

## Environmental Monitoring Relevance
- Applies standardized calibration data to monitor mercury ion presence in environmental and human-derived samples.
- Combines optical sensing with ICP-MS validation to improve reliability for policy-relevant monitoring and health risk assessment.
