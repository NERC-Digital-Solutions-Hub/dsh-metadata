# Method for the determination of soluble mercury content of amalgam suspensions

## Aim
- Identify the stability of mercury amalgam in distilled water, saliva, and bacteria in waste pipes at 11°C and 37°C.
- Determine absolute mercury content with ICP-MS and validate with a rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor using a fluorimeter.
- Collect data at multiple time points: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.

## Experimental material and preparation
- Amalgam source: 3 GS-80 spherical amalgam capsules (per capsule: Hg 456 mg, Ag 336 mg, Sn 174 mg, Cu 90 mg).
- Procedure: amalgam spills triturated, spills removed, ground to powder.

## Common data collection approach
- For each environment, 100 mL of the specified medium is used.
- Samples are incubated at 11°C or 37°C.
- After incubation, 3 mL of the supernatant is filtered; 1 mL used for ICP-MS; 2 mL used for luminescence (fluorescence sensor).
- Timepoints as listed above; analyses include ICP-MS for mercury content and rhodamine-based luminescence for sensor validation.

## Distilled water protocol
- Amalgam powder added to 100 mL distilled water.
- Sealed in a Duran bottle and incubated at 11°C or 37°C.
- Sampling: 3 mL supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.

## Saliva protocol
- 100 mL saliva collected and centrifuged at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes; supernatant filtered through a 5 µm filter.
- Amalgam powder added to 100 mL saliva; sealed in a Duran bottle; incubated at 11°C or 37°C.
- Sampling: 3 mL supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.

## Effluent waste amalgam protocol
- 3168 mg waste dental amalgam sludge added to 100 mL distilled water.
- Sealed in a Duran bottle and incubated at 11°C or 37°C.
- Sampling: 3 mL supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.
