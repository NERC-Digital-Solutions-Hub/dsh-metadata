# Calibration of a sensor for mercury (II) ions using a Fluorimeter

## Purpose and scope
- Dataset files document calibration of a sensor for Hg(II) using a Fluorimeter with HgCl2 or HgNO3 as the mercury source.
- Explores a range of sample conditions, including sensor concentrations and water/methanol co-solvent ratios (required for probe solubility).
- Assesses the impact of acid (nitric acid) on sensor sensitivity to mercury.

## Experimental design
- Measurements: luminescent response of the sensor (excitation at 500 nm) to varying Hg(II) concentrations.
- Variations tested: sensor concentration, water-to-methanol ratio, and presence of nitric acid to stabilize HgNO3.
- Calibration outcome: a linear relationship between Hg(II) concentration and luminescent signal to enable quantification of unknown samples.
- Data presentation: calibration graphs derived from raw fluorimetry data; graphs provided in an accompanying PowerPoint file.

## Real-world samples and media
- Real-sample testing with dental context: 1 µM sensor used to probe dental clinical and amalgam samples.
- Media tested: saliva, distilled water, and amalgam separator supernatant, to evaluate measurable sensor response in different environments.

## Validation and additional measurements (ICP-MS)
- ICP-MS data provided to validate the sensor calibration.
- Used to monitor soluble mercury content in dental amalgam samples stored at 11°C or 37°C, in water and saliva.
- Supernatant from suspensions is filtered and measured by ICP-MS, with results reported accordingly.

## Data availability and interpretation
- Calibration graphs are contained in the PowerPoint file; raw fluorimeter data underpins these graphs.
- The linear calibration supports quantifying unknown Hg(II) concentrations across tested conditions and media.

## Considerations and limitations
- Methanol co-solvent is necessary for probe solubility; solvent ratio can influence results.
- Nitric acid stability considerations affect HgNO3 behavior and sensor response.
- Real-sample matrices (saliva, amalgam) may affect luminescent readouts and require validation with ICP-MS data.
