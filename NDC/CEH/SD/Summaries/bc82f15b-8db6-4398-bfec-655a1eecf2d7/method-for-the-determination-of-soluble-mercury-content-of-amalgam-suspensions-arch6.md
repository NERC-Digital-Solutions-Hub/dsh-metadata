# Method for the determination of soluble mercury content of amalgam suspensions

## Overview
- Investigates stability of mercury amalgam in distilled water, saliva, and bacteria in waste pipes at two temperatures: 11°C and 37°C.
- Absolute mercury content determined by ICP-MS; validated with rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor using fluorimetry.
- Measurements taken at multiple time points: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.

## Experimental design and samples
- Distilled water
  - Three GS-80 spherical amalgam capsules (Hg 456 mg, Ag 336 mg, Sn 174 mg, Cu 90 mg) triturated.
  - Amalgam spilled, ground to powder, added to 100 mL distilled water, sealed in Duran bottle.
  - Incubated at 37°C or 11°C.
  - Sample processing: 3 mL supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.
- Saliva
  - 100 mL saliva collected, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min; supernatant filtered (5 µm).
  - 3 GS-80 capsules triturated and added to 100 mL saliva; sealed and incubated at 37°C or 11°C.
  - Sample processing: 3 mL supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.
- Effluent waste amalgam
  - 3168 mg waste dental amalgam sludge added to 100 mL distilled water; sealed and incubated at 37°C or 11°C.
  - Sample processing: 3 mL supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.

## Data collection and measurements
- Mercury concentration data collected via ICP-MS from 1 mL aliquots per sample per time point.
- Luminescence measurements obtained using rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor ( fluorimeter ) from 2 mL aliquots per sample per time point.
- Time-series data across all environments and temperatures for each of the defined time points (1 h, 1 d, 1 w, 1 m, 3 m).

## Data processing and quality assurance
- Filtration and sample preparation steps standardized to ensure consistency across conditions.
- Parallel use of ICP-MS and luminescence methods provides cross-validation of mercury measurements.
- Clear traceability: sample type, condition (water/saliva/effluent), capsule composition, temperature, and time point documented for each data entry.

## Data products and outputs
- Dataset of absolute mercury concentrations by:
  - Environment (distilled water, saliva, effluent)
  - Temperature (11°C, 37°C)
  - Time point (1 h, 1 d, 1 w, 1 m, 3 m)
- Luminescence readings corresponding to each sample point for methodological cross-check.
- Comparative insights on mercury release/stability across environments and over time.

## Timeline and sampling framework
- Timepoints span from 1 hour to 3 months, enabling assessment of short- to long-term stability of amalgam in each environment and at both temperatures.

## Data governance and reproducibility considerations
- Detailed capsule composition and preparation steps to support replicability.
- Consistent sample processing volumes and filtration steps to ensure comparability.
- Dual-method measurement approach enhances reliability and data quality.

## Relevance to data support tasks
- Demonstrates data collection from heterogeneous sources and formats (ICP-MS and luminescence).
- Requires data validation, cleaning, and integration into a cohesive time-series dataset.
- Produces data products suitable for dashboards or reports comparing mercury release across environments and conditions, with potential for sharing early prototypes or iterative updates.
