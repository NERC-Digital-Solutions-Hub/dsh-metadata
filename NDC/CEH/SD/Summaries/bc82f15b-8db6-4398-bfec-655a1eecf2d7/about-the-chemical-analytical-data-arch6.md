# These dataset files show the calibration of a sensor for mercury (II) ions using a Fluorimeter and either HgCl 2 or HgNO 3 . A range of different sample conditions are tested, including sensor concentrations and relative proportions of water and a methanol co-solvent (required for solubility of the probe). Also tested was the ability of acid to affect the probes sensitivity to mercury as nitric acid is needed for the stability of HgNO 3 as an analyte . File names listed show the concentration of sensor and the ratio of water to methanol tested. Calibration is done by measuring the luminescent response of the sensor (exciting at 500nm) to various concentrations of Hg(II). A linear relation to increasing mercury concentration can be applied to measure unknown sample concentrations. The calibration graphs from each of the raw fluorimeter data are given in the PowerPoint file. The file showing the dental clinical and amalgam samples are tested using a 1 µM sensor to see whether a measurable response is seen to real mercury samples in different media (saliva, distilled water or amalgam separator supernatant). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) data are also given these are used to validate the sensors calibration and also to monitor the levels of soluble mercury content of dental amalgam samples held at either (11⁰C or 37⁰C) in water and saliva. The supernatant of these suspensions is filtered and measured using ICP-MS to give the data as reported.

- Purpose and scope
  - Document datasets for calibrating a Hg(II) sensor using fluorescence (excitation at 500 nm) with HgCl2 or HgNO3.
  - Explore how sensor concentration, water:methanol ratios, and acid effects influence calibration and sensitivity.

- Data types and formats
  - Raw fluorimeter data showing luminescent response versus Hg(II) concentration.
  - Calibration graphs compiled in a PowerPoint file.
  - ICP-MS data used for validation and monitoring soluble mercury in dental amalgam samples.

- Experimental conditions captured
  - Sensor concentrations and varying water-to-methanol ratios (co-solvent required for probe solubility).
  - Effect of acid on sensor sensitivity, noting nitric acid stability with HgNO3.
  - Real-sample tests using a 1 µM sensor in media: saliva, distilled water, and amalgam separator supernatant.

- Validation and cross-checks
  - ICP-MS data validate the calibration curves and quantify soluble mercury in dental amalgams.
  - Temperature conditions for samples: 11°C (11⁰C) or 37°C, in water and saliva.
  - Supernatants filtered prior to ICP-MS analysis.

- Data products and reuse potential
  - Calibrated linear relationship enables estimation of unknown Hg(II) concentrations from luminescent signals.
  - Potential to build data products (e.g., combined calibration dataset or an interpreting guide) and share calibration graphs for external use.

- Data integration and sharing considerations
  - File naming encodes sensor concentration and water:methanol ratio, aiding dataset integration.
  - Multiple data formats (raw fluorimeter data, PowerPoint graphs, ICP-MS data) require standardization for seamless reuse.
  - Cross-validation across media and conditions enhances robustness of the sensor calibration.
