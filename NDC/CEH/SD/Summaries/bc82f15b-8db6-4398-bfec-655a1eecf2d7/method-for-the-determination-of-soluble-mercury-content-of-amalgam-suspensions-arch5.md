# Method for the determination of soluble mercury content of amalgam suspensions

## Aim and scope
- Identify the stability of mercury amalgam in distilled water, saliva, and bacteria present in waste pipes, at two temperatures (11 °C and 37 °C).
- Determine absolute mercury content using ICP-MS and verify with a rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor via fluorimetry.
- Obtain measurements at multiple time points: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.

## Sample environments and preparation
- Distilled water
  - Three GS-80 spherical amalgam capsules (Hg 456 mg, Ag 336 mg, Sn 174 mg, Cu 90 mg per capsule) triturated.
  - Amalgam spills ground to powder, added to 100 mL distilled water, sealed in a Duran bottle.
  - Incubated at 37 °C or 11 °C.
  - 3 mL of supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.
- Saliva
  - 100 mL saliva collected, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min; supernatant filtered through a 5 µm syringe filter.
  - 3 GS-80 capsules triturated; amalgam spills added to 100 mL saliva; sealed in a Duran bottle.
  - Incubated at 37 °C or 11 °C.
  - 3 mL of supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.
- Effluent waste amalgam
  - 3,168 mg of waste dental amalgam sludge added to 100 mL distilled water; sealed in a Duran bottle.
  - Incubated at 37 °C or 11 °C.
  - 3 mL of supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.

## Analytical methods and timepoints
- Mercury measurement
  - Absolute mercury content determined by ICP-MS.
  - Verification using a rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor with fluorimetry.
- Timepoints for analysis
  - 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.

## Data and metadata considerations for stewardship
- Data to collect and track
  - Sample type (distilled water, saliva, effluent amalgam), environmental condition (temperature: 11 °C or 37 °C), timepoint, and replicate.
  - Mercury concentration results from ICP-MS and luminescence readings from the fluorimeter.
  - Capsule composition details and lot information; preparation steps and volumes used (e.g., 3 capsules, 100 mL volumes; 3 mL filtered supernatant; 1 mL ICP-MS; 2 mL luminescence).
  - Instrument settings and calibration context for ICP-MS and luminescence measurements.
- Metadata and provenance
  - Document sample preparation steps, processing sequence, and any deviations.
  - Capture batch, date of analysis, and personnel involved to support reproducibility and traceability.
- Data storage and sharing
  - Store datasets in a central repository with clear file naming for environment, sample type, temperature, and timepoint.
  - Use consistent units and formats (e.g., mg Hg per sample, volumes in mL, temperature in °C).
  - Include a metadata schema that links each measurement to its corresponding sample condition and preparation details.

## Quality assurance and governance considerations
- Consistency and reproducibility
  - Maintain standardized preparation steps and exact volumes across all sample types.
  - Record all QA steps and any troubleshooting or deviations.
- Data integrity and interoperability
  - Ensure alignment between ICP-MS data and luminescence results through clear linking identifiers.
  - Prepare for potential data gaps if timepoints are missed and document reasons.
- Challenges to address
  - Managing multiple environments and formats (water, saliva, sludge) and integrating results from two analytical modalities.
  - Maintaining traceability of capsules, batches, and reagents to support robust data governance.
