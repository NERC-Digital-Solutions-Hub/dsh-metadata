# Method for the determination of soluble mercury content of amalgam suspensions

## Aim
- Identify the stability of mercury amalgam in different environments: distilled water, saliva, and bacteria found in waste pipes.
- Assess at two temperatures: 11°C and 37°C.
- Determine absolute mercury content using ICP-MS and validate with a rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor (fluorimeter).
- Obtain data at multiple time points: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.

## Environments and samples
- Distilled water
- Saliva
- Effluent waste amalgam (waste dental amalgam sludge)

## Sample preparation and setup
- Distilled water
  - 3 GS-80 spherical amalgam capsules (Hg 456 mg, Ag 336 mg, Sn 174 mg, Cu 90 mg) are triturated.
  - Amalgam spills ground to powder, added to 100 mL distilled water.
  - Mixture sealed in a Duran bottle and incubated at 37°C or 11°C.
  - After incubation: 3 mL of supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.
- Saliva
  - 100 mL saliva collected and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes; supernatant filtered (5 µm).
  - 3 GS-80 capsules triturated; amalgam spills ground to powder.
  - Amalgam added to 100 mL saliva; sealed in a Duran bottle; incubated at 37°C or 11°C.
  - After incubation: 3 mL of supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.
- Effluent waste amalgam
  - 3168 mg waste amalgam sludge added to 100 mL distilled water.
  - Sealed in a Duran bottle; incubated at 37°C or 11°C.
  - After incubation: 3 mL of supernatant filtered; 1 mL for ICP-MS; 2 mL for luminescence.

## Incubation conditions
- Temperatures: 11°C and 37°C for all environments.
- Timepoints for analysis: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.

## Analytical methods
- Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine absolute mercury content.
- Luminescence detection using a rhodamine-derivative mercury sensor, analyzed with a fluorimeter.
- For each matrix and condition, measurements are taken at the specified timepoints.

## Data collection and outputs
- Mercury concentration results by matrix (distilled water, saliva, waste amalgam) under both temperature conditions.
- Temporal profiles showing mercury release/stability at 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months.
- Cross-validation between ICP-MS and luminescence sensor readings.

## GIS-relevant considerations (for data products)
- Data structure: multi-matrix, multi-temperature time-series of mercury concentrations.
- Potential representations: temporal maps/dashboards showing mercury release trends across environments and conditions; integration with sample source locations if geographic metadata are available.
- Data quality and standardization: ensure consistent units, calibration between ICP-MS and luminescence readings, and alignment of timepoints across matrices.
- Use cases: assessing environmental/risk implications of amalgam disposal in various settings; informing policy or public-facing dashboards about mercury stability over time.
