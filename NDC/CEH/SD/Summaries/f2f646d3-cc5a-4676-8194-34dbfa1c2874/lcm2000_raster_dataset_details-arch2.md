# 25m raster

## Overview
- Describes two raster datasets derived from LCM2000 land cover: a 25m raster recording the dominant land cover by LCM2000 Subclass, and a 1km raster summarised from the 25m data.
- The 25m data are stored in an efficient 8-bit integer format by scaling Subclass codes; the 1km raster expresses Aggregate class codes.

## 25m raster dataset details
- Creation method: Generated by converting land parcels from a vector dataset into a 25m grid; each 25m cell records the dominant LCM2000 Subclass at that location.
- Grid dimensions:
  - Great Britain: 24,400 columns × 48,400 rows
  - Northern Ireland: 7,600 columns × 7,200 rows
- Spatial extent and origin:
  - Great Britain lower-left corner: easting 50,000 m; northing 10,000 m
  - Northern Ireland lower-left corner: easting 180,000 m; northing 280,000 m
- Pixel size: 25 m
- Coordinate systems and datums:
  - Great Britain: British National Grid (OSGB 1936) using Transverse Mercator; Spheroid Airy
  - Northern Ireland: Irish National Grid (Ireland 1965) using Transverse Mercator; Spheroid Airy Modified 1849
- Pixel center reference: To obtain the pixel centre, add 12.5 m to the lower-left corner coordinates
- Coding: LCM2000 Subclass codes (normally floating point with one decimal) are multiplied by 10 to store as unsigned 8-bit bytes (0–255)
  - Example: Water (inland) Subclass 22.1 becomes 221 in the raster

## 1km raster dataset details
- Creation method: Summarised from the 25m raster within 1km grid cells
- Grid dimensions:
  - Great Britain: 700 columns × 1,300 rows
  - Northern Ireland: 500 columns × 500 rows
- Pixel size: 1,000 m
- Spatial extent and origin:
  - Lower-left corners for both GB and NI are at 0,0
- Coordinate systems and datums:
  - Great Britain: British National Grid; Transverse Mercator; OSGB 1936; Spheroid Airy
  - Northern Ireland: Irish National Grid; Transverse Mercator; Ireland 1965; Spheroid Airy Modified 1849
- Pixel centre reference: To obtain the pixel centre, add 500 m to the lower-left corner coordinates

## Subclass to Aggregate class mapping and codes
- The 25m raster uses LCM2000 Subclass codes; the 1km raster uses LCM2000 Aggregate class codes
- A correspondence table (Table 3) defines how Subclass codes map to Aggregate class codes for efficient storage and analysis
- The table covers a wide range of land cover types, including but not limited to:
  - Sea/Estuary (Oceanic seas), Water (inland) (Standing open water), Littoral rock/sediment (Coastal), Saltmarsh, Supra-littoral rock/sediment (Coastal)
  - Habitats such as Bog (deep peat), Dense/Open dwarf shrub heath, Montane habitats
  - Vegetation types: Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland
  - Grasslands: Improved, Neutral, Setaside, Bracken, Calcareous, Acid
  - Semi-natural and arable categories: Fen/marsh/swamp, Arable cereals/Arable horticulture/Arable non-rotational
  - Developed areas: Suburban/rural developed, Continuous urban
  - Other: Inland bare ground
- An example mapping:
  - Sea/Estuary Subclass code 22.1 (stored as 221) corresponds to 1km code 10 (Oceanic seas)
  - Water (inland) Subclass code 13.1 (stored as 131) corresponds to 1km code 8 (Standing open water)
  - Littoral rock Subclass code 20.1 (stored as 201) corresponds to 1km code 9 (Coastal)
- Encoding: Subclass codes are stored as 8-bit integers after scaling, enabling compact raster storage and cross-scale comparisons

## Notes on usage and storage
- The 25m raster captures localized dominant land-cover types, while the 1km raster provides aggregated broad classes for larger-scale analyses
- These standardized rasters facilitate time-series comparisons of environmental conditions and policy performance across Great Britain and Northern Ireland
- Data are prepared for efficient storage in raster formats and for uploading to appropriate data portals or repositories
