# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Overview
  - Establishes how Broad Habitats map to LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses and Variants (with Suclasses shown by map colours).
  - Provides the framework for standardised habitat categorisation used in monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.

- Data sources and mapping approach
  - LCM2000: Land Cover Map 2000 data based on a 25 m grid.
  - Variants, Subclasses and Target Classes reflect a crosswalk to capture detailed habitat types (e.g., Sea/Estuary, Water (inland), Littoral rock and sediment, Bogs, Montane habitats, etc.).
  - The mapping supports consistent reporting across UK countries (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland).

- Tables and what they illustrate
  - Table 5: Coverage (km2) of Subclasses from LCM2000 and Aggregate classes (bold) from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) across the UK and constituent countries.
    - Provides per-habitat area estimates from LCM2000 and field survey for England, Wales, Scotland, NI, and the UK total (e.g., Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable cereals, Improved grassland, Urban/built-up areas, etc.).
    - Highlights differences in totals between LCM2000 and FS and notes coastal coverage variability and definitional differences.
  - Table 6: LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) vs FS estimates at 95% confidence intervals for England, Wales, Scotland, NI, and GB.
    - Compares major habitat classes (e.g., Broadleaved/mixed woodlands, Coniferous woodland, Arable and horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing open water, Built up areas, etc.).
    - Shows Low/High FS estimates alongside LCM2000 figures to illustrate uncertainty and potential biases.
  - Tables 8–10: Summary correspondence matrices comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares in GB and specifically England & Wales.
    - Present results per 1000 (weighted estimates) across Broad Habitats, Target Class, Aggregate Class; include urban-generalisation considerations and bootstrapped confidence intervals.
    - Provide cross-walks of correspondences between CS2000 and LCM2000 classes at multiple aggregation levels.
  - Footnotes accompany tables to explain data sources, definitions (e.g., FS = field survey), calibration status, grid resolutions, coastline/tidal considerations, and regional survey practices.

- Key methodological notes for analysts
  - Calibration and uncalibrated data: Tables distinguish uncalibrated LCM2000 from FS calibration and CS2000 crosswalks; calibration affects comparability and interpretation.
  - Spatial units and sampling: LCM2000 statistics based on a 25 m grid; FS statistics based on 1 km squares; coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and offshore areas.
  - UK-wide and country-level reporting: Tables present totals and regional breakdowns for England, Wales, Scotland, NI, and GB to enable cross-jurisdiction monitoring.

- Relevance to Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Enables consistent, standardized representation of environmental condition over time through explicit mapping between land-cover classes and ecological target classifications.
  - Facilitates quality assurance, data cleaning, and transformation to produce clear outputs (reports, maps, charts) for monitoring environmental health and policy performance.
  - Supports storage and portal-upload practices for datasets and outputs.

- Practical implications and challenges
  - Data value enhancement: Need to combine datasets (LCM2000, CS2000, FS) with other relevant data to avoid single-use datasets and enrich analysis.
  - Data accessibility: Emphasises enabling access to underlying data used to create final outputs, improving transparency and reusability.

- Endnotes and caveats (high level)
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS are explained in the text; coastal coverage and urban generalisation introduce uncertainties.
  - Some FS or regional figures are not available (n/a) in certain tables; estimates are subject to bootstrapping and confidence interval considerations.
