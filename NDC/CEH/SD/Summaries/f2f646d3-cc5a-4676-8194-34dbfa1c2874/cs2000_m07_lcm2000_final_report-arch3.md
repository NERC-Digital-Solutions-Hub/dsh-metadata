# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Purpose of the document: to relate Broad Habitats (BHs) to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants, providing a framework for environmental monitoring and policy evaluation through linked habitat classifications.
- Structure: presents mappings where each BH is associated with a LCM2000 Target class, its Subclasses, and Variants (with descriptive map colours used for display).
- Coverage of BHs: includes a wide range of coastal, terrestrial, freshwater, and urban habitats (e.g., Sea/Estuary, Water inland, Littoral rock, Supra-littoral rock, Bogs, Fens, Montane habitats, Forests, Arable & Horticultural, Improved grassland, Urban/Built-up areas, etc.).
- Detail level: BHs are broken down into Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants to enable precise crosswalks between map products and field classifications.

## Key Mapping Structure and Examples

- Inshore Sublittoral (Sea/Estuary) -> BH 22: Subclasses Sea/Estuary; Variants = sea.
- Standing water/canals (Water inland) -> BH 13: Subclasses Water (inland); Variants = water (inland).
- Littoral and Supra-littoral types -> BHs 20, 18, 21, 19, 12, 16, etc., with Target classes like Littoral rock/sediment, Supra-littoral rock/sediment, Saltmarsh, Dune, Built-up areas, etc.
- Woodland and forest types -> BHs 1 (Broad-leaved woodland), 2 (Coniferous woodland), with Variants indicating deciduous/mixed/open plantations.
- Grasslands and heath -> BHs 5 (Improved grassland), 6/7 (Neutral/Calcareous), 8 (Acid), 9 (Bracken), etc., including montane/heath variants.
- Arable/horticultural and urban -> BHs 4 (Arable & horticultural), 17 (Built up areas/gardens), 16 (Inland rock), 18 (Supralittoral rock), etc.
- Comprehensive coverage: includes Semi-natural grassland, Dwarf shrub heath, Bog, Fen, Marsh and Swamp, Inland Bare Ground, Mountain/heath/bog, Water bodies, and various coastal/urban interfaces.
- Note: Footnotes indicate complexity in linking LCM2000 statistics to field survey counts and the influence of coastal/intertidal area definitions on totals.

## Data Coverage and Comparison

- Table 5: Coverage (km2) by Subclasses from Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) and Aggregate classes (bold) from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) across the UK and constituent countries.
  - Provides area extents for each BH-related subclass across England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and UK totals.
  - Examples (selected aggregates): 
    - Broad-leaved/mixed woodland: UK LCM2000 = 15,600 km2; FS = 15,220 km2.
    - Coniferous woodland: UK LCM2000 = 13,540 km2; FS = 14,350 km2.
    - Arable & Horticulture: UK LCM2000 = 57,630 km2; FS = 53,070 km2.
    - Improved grassland: UK LCM2000 = 59,073 km2; FS = 60,500 km2.
    - Built up areas and gardens: UK LCM2000 = 16,637 km2; FS = not available.
  - Notes: LCM2000 statistics come from a full count on a 25 m grid; FS statistics from Haines-Young et al. 2000; coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of intertidal areas; totals differ by FS population definitions and geography.

- Table 6: LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) for BHs by country vs field survey estimates at 95% confidence (GB Low/High ranges).
  - Provides calibration-style ranges comparing LCM2000 estimates to field survey estimates for each BH (e.g., Broadleaved woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & Horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Montane habitats, Inland rock, Built up areas, Supralittoral/Littoral/Seaward categories).
  - Key takeaway: there is a broad pattern of agreement with geographic variation; field survey estimates often widen the uncertainty around LCM2000 numbers, highlighting calibration needs for policy monitoring.

- Tables 8–10: Summary correspondence matrices (per 1000) comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares in GB, England & Wales, and Scotland.
  - Method: weighted estimates using strata based on 40 Land Classes; bootstrapped to derive confidence intervals.
  - Output: correspondences between LCM2000 Target Class and Aggregate class levels and CS2000 field survey classes; also includes “BHlevel” (excluding linear features) and generalised urban categories.
  - Observations:
    - Broad Habitat correspondences show substantial alignment in many BH-to-CS2000 mappings, with varied correspondence strength across specific class pairs.
    - Some categories exhibit low or zero correspondences, indicating where LCM2000 may under- or over-represent field-identified habitats, or where classification schemes diverge.
    - The matrices illustrate the complexity of translating between a 25 m resolution land-cover map (LCM2000) and field-survey grid cells (CS2000/FS), including urban generalisation effects.

- Footnotes (Tables context): 
  - LCM2000 statistics are a full 25 m grid count; FS statistics are from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS statistics are explained in the text.
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and intertidal inclusion/exclusion.
  - Total coverage depends on how 1 km square FS units are defined; some BHs are excluded in Northern Ireland.
  - Several tables include “n/a” where data are not available.

## Data Quality, Gaps and Governance Considerations

- Data gaps and accessibility:
  - Common challenges include lack of data, data access barriers, organizational silos, and gaps in metadata.
  - Sharing underlying data publicly can be a barrier to using existing datasets.
- Metadata and data transformation:
  - Inadequate metadata can hinder verification of data suitability against requirements.
  - Data formats often require effortful transformation to be usable for monitoring.
- Governance and openness:
  - Data governance processes are needed to ensure datasets meet standards, are stored and shared appropriately, and remain up-to-date.
- Calibration needs:
  - Differences between LCM2000 (remote-sensed map) and CS2000/FS (field survey) require ongoing calibration and validation to ensure monitoring indicators are robust for policy decisions.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- Cross-walk utility:
  - The mapping between BHs and LCM2000/CS2000 classes enables translating remotely-sensed habitat data into field-based habitat concepts used in policy and environment health reporting.
- Multi-scale and cross-border consistency:
  - Tables show UK-wide and country-level variations, underscoring the need for consistent cross-border methodological standards and transparent documentation of definitions.
- Validation and calibration:
  - The reported correspondences and 95% CIs highlight the importance of regular validation of land-cover products against field data for monitoring indicators.
- Coverage interpretation:
  - Large differences in area estimates between LCM2000 and FS for certain habitats suggest caution when using raw totals for policy targets; use of aggregated BHs and calibrated metrics is advised.
- Urban and coastal generalisation:
  - Generalisation of urban areas and coastal/intertidal zones impacts correspondences; monitoring frameworks should explicitly document how these areas are treated in indicators.

## Recommendations for Authors of Monitoring Frameworks

- Use BH-LCM2000-CS2000 crosswalks to:
  - Develop policy-relevant indicators that are consistent across map products and field data.
  - Validate and calibrate remote-sensing habitat classes with targeted field surveys.
- Prioritize data governance:
  - Establish metadata standards, data-sharing policies, and versioning to reduce barriers to reuse and ensure reproducibility.
- Address data gaps:
  - Identify BHs with weak correspondence or data gaps and commission targeted data collection or refinement of classification schemes.
- Communicate uncertainties:
  - Report confidence intervals and potential biases when presenting habitat area estimates or crosswalk-derived indicators.
- Harmonise scales and definitions:
  - Align grid cell definitions (e.g., 25 m vs 1 km) and coastal/intertidal inclusion to improve comparability across datasets and national programs.
- Promote transparent documentation:
  - Publish the methodology for crosswalks, calibration procedures, and the handling of urban/generalised areas to support independent review and reuse.
