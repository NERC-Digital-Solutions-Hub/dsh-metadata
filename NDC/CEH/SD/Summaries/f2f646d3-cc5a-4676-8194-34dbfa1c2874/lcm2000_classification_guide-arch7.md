# LCM2000 Final Report

- Scope and aim
  - Develop a UK-wide broad habitat (BH) framework to support biodiversity reporting under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP).
  - Map terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal Broad Habitats by linking spectral classes from LCM2000 with BHs, Target classes, and Subclasses.
  - Provide aggregate (10-class) maps and statistics for reporting, while retaining detailed BH/Subclass information for specialist use.
- Data and classifications
  - LCM2000 is a thematic, satellite-based spectral classification; BHs are broader habitat concepts and may not map exactly to spectral classes.
  - Target classes and Subclasses are defined to best fit BHs; Variants capture spectral components and changes (e.g., crops, managed vs semi-natural grasslands).
  - Map displays lean on cartographic conventions to balance reliability, pattern visibility, and practical interpretation at national/regional scales.
- Calibration and validation approach
  - CS2000 field survey data (1998–1999) used for calibration, not ground truth; it provides a detailed reference framework but has resolution differences from LCM2000.
  - 569 one-km squares were analyzed; comparisons performed at multiple thematic levels: BH level, Target class level, and Aggregate class level.
  - Calibration involved three tests:
    - Per-pixel: direct overlay differences.
    - Per-segment: dominant FS class within LCM2000 segments.
    - Per-parcel: FS parcels translated to LCM2000 labels.
- Confidence assessment methods
  - A bootstrapping method estimated 95% confidence limits for correspondence measures.
  - Analyses were stratified by GB, England/Wales, and Scotland to reflect regional variations.
- Key results: accuracy and correspondence
  - Overall correspondence (GB) at BH level (per-pixel): 54% (95% CI 53–56%); per-parcel: 62% (60–64%); per-segment: 58% (57–60%).
  - England & Wales: per-pixel 60% (58–62%); per-parcel 69% (67–72%); per-segment 64% (62–66%).
  - Scotland: per-pixel 44% (40–47%); per-parcel 48% (44–52%); per-segment 47% (43–50%).
  - Target class level shows higher correspondence: GB parcel-based ~65%; England/Wales ~73%; Scotland ~51%.
  - Reasons for mismatches include: FS higher native resolution, survey timing differences, definition differences, and MMU differences (FS >0.04 ha vs LCM2000 >0.5 ha).
- Notable habitat-specific insights
  - Woodlands
    - Broadleaved/mixed woodland align poorly in direct maps due to small patch sizes; many small woods are below LCM2000’s minimum mapping unit.
    - Coniferous woodland shows higher direct correspondence (~70%) and tends to map more consistently.
  - Arable and horticulture
    - LCM2000 estimates slightly higher overall arable share; misclassifications between arable, built-up, and grassland contribute to errors.
  - Grasslands
    - Improved grassland is robustly identifiable; distinctions between neutral, calcareous, and acid grasslands are challenging spectrally.
    - Rough/unmanaged grasslands are difficult to separate; FS often records them as improved or semi-natural differently from LCM2000.
  - Semi-natural elements and peatlands
    - Distinctions among neutral, calcareous, and acid grasslands are weak spectrally; peat depth is used as a key differentiator for bogs, but peat masks can under-represent bogs.
    - The bog class in LCM2000 is described as “Bog (deep peat)” and is sensitive to peat-depth context maps.
  - Heath, bog, and montane; inland bare ground
    - Montane habitats are rarely captured accurately due to limited field access and altitude-based rules; inland bare ground is often misclassified or included in urban contexts by FS.
    - Dwarf shrub heath and bogs are mapped differently in LCM2000 vs FS due to distinct underlying definitions and peat-depth criteria.
  - Coastal and boundary features
    - Coastal BHs (supra-littoral and littoral classes) are small and often near or below the resolution of LCM2000; many coastal features are aggregated for reporting.
    - Boundary and linear features, and rivers/streams, were not targeted as BHs by LCM2000 (excluded due to MMU constraints) and thus affect calibration outcomes.
- Change detection and learning
  - Between 1990 and 2000, landscape changes are likely small and often confounded by measurement error.
  - Satellite-only methods have limits for robust change detection; intelligent, pattern-informed approaches are recommended (e.g., leveraging FS change directions from 1990 and 1998).
  - Calibration insights help identify under- or over-estimates in 2000 and guide interpretation of observed changes.
- Practical implications for GIS work
  - Use of BH, Target class, and Aggregate class hierarchies enables both detailed GIS analyses and broad reporting.
  - Different spatial resolutions (FS vs LCM2000) and varying MMUs require careful alignment when integrating field data with map products.
  - External datasets (soil pH, peat depth, urban context maps) enhance accuracy for challenging classes (neutral vs calcareous vs acid grasslands; bogs; rough grasslands).
  - Built-up and garden areas are captured with urban-suburban differentiation, providing more nuanced urban land representations than in FS alone.
- Appendix and supplementary material
  - Appendix I provides detailed distinguishing features of Broad Habitats and explains spectral versus floristic mapping challenges, including how peat depth, pH, and context influence class distinctions.

- Overall takeaway for GIS specialists
  - LCM2000 provides comprehensive, nationwide coverage with a robust framework for BH mapping, but notable class-level and regional discrepancies remain due to resolution, spectral limitations, and differing field definitions.
  - For accurate habitat inventories and trend analysis, combine LCM2000 outputs with field data, soil/peat datasets, and region-specific calibrations; apply the 10-class aggregate for consistent reporting while preserving detailed BH-level information for advanced analyses.
