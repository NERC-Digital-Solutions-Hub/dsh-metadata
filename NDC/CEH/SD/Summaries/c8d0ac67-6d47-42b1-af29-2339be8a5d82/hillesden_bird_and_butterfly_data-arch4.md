# Bird and Butterfly abundance data from consistently surveyed agri-environmental monitoring transects at Hillesden, UK (2006-2017)

- Content and scope
  - Dataset of bird and butterfly abundance from Hillesden, UK, covering 2006–2017, with two five-year AES (agri-environmental habitat) experiments.
  - Enables analysis of ten-year interannual population trends across both AES phases and comparison with equivalent national recording schemes (BBS for birds, WCBMS for butterflies).
  - Represents a subset of the Hillesden biological survey data, restricted to transects recorded consistently (nine bird transects, seven butterfly transects) and species present on the majority of transects.
  - Data comprise maximum annual counts per transect per year, across monthly visits in the April–August window.

- Experimental context
  - Hillesden Estate in southern lowland England used to test AES effects on biodiversity, with two five-year phases (2006–2010 and 2012–2017).
  - AES treatments involved 1–5% of land converted to habitats (grass margins, wildflowers, pollen/nectar resources, wild bird seed mixtures).
  - AES implementation guided by expert agronomic and environmental advice; phase adjustments in 2011 to reflect policy changes.

- Data collection and sampling design
  - Birds: monthly breeding-season surveys on ~1 km transects along field boundaries and AES habitats; surveys after sunrise; three transects surveyed per surveyor per day; records include birds within hedge/AES areas on ~1:2000 scale maps; unsuitable conditions (heavy rain or wind) excluded.
  - Butterflies: monthly May–August surveys on 2 × 50 m transects within AES habitats plus two-minute timed observations of a 2 × 2 m quadrat at each transect end; surveys 10:00–16:00, with specified soil/temperature/sky conditions.
  - Transects filtered to those surveyed consistently across both AES phases; nine bird transects and seven butterfly transects retained.
  - Species selection based on presence on >50% of selected transects; birds counted as adults within 10 m of transects (excludes birds only seen in flight).

- Data processing and structure
  - Raw counts transformed to maximum counts per transect per year.
  - Recorded values: maximum annual counts of each species per transect per year.
  - Data structure in CSV files:
    - Hillesden_Bird_Abundance_2006-2016.csv
    - Hillesden_Butterfly_Abundance_2007-2017.csv
    - Columns: Species, SiteCode, Year, MaxCount
  - Species coding: Birds use BTO 5-letter codes; butterflies use vernacular names.

- Quality control and provenance
  - Field identification and counting conducted by experienced surveyors.
  - Locations mapped with transect IDs (butterflies) or Ordnance Survey 1:2000 maps (birds).
  - Data digitised with error checking during and after entry.

- Methods and supporting references
  - Data collection referenced to standard bird census (Bibby et al. 1992) and Hillesden AES impact studies (Hinsley et al. 2010; Heard et al. 2012; Redhead et al. 2018).
  - Experimental design and habitat treatments documented in related Hillesden publications.

- Access, origin, and funding
  - Collected under UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH); Defra-funded AES project with analytical work supported by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) via ASSIST (NE/N018125/1).
  - Data enable cross-system comparisons with national schemes and support assessment of AES outcomes on biodiversity.

- Potential uses for Data Leaders
  - Long-term trend analysis across AES phases to inform data strategy and governance for ecological monitoring.
  - Benchmarking against national schemes (BBS/WCBMS) for cross-site consistency and interoperability.
  - Evaluation of data collection protocols, metadata quality, and the value of consistent transect sampling for policy-relevant biodiversity indicators.
  - Informing prioritization of data collection efforts, gap identification, and collaboration within wider data communities of practice.
