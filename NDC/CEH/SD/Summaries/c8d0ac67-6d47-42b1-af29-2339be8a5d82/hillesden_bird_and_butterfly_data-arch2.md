Bird and Butterfly abundance data from consistently surveyed agri-environmental monitoring transects at Hillesden, UK (2006-2017)

## Overview
- Dataset of bird and butterfly abundance from Hillesden, UK, spanning 2006–2017.
- Based on field-surveyed transects, including two five-year experimental manipulations of agri-environmental habitats (AES).
- Enables analysis of ten-year interannual population trends across both AES phases and comparison with national schemes (Birds: BBS; Butterflies: WCBMS).
- Focuses on transects recorded consistently (nine for birds, seven for butterflies) and species present on the majority of transects.
- Data represent maximum annual counts per transect per year, aggregated from monthly visits during April–August.

## Experimental design and context
- Site: Hillesden Estate, southern lowland England.
- AES experiments conducted 2006–2010 and 2012–2017 to explore effects of AES on biodiversity.
- AES areas comprised 1–5% of land converted to habitats (grass margins, perennial wildflowers, nectar/pollen resources, and sown wild bird seed).
- AES management informed by expert agronomic and environmental advice; Hillesden chosen as representative of lowland England.

## Data collection and survey methods
- Birds:
  - Monthly breeding-season surveys on ~1 km transects along field boundaries.
  - Surveys conducted within four hours after sunrise; three transects surveyed per surveyor per day.
  - Detections recorded on ~1:2000 scale maps; presence near AES habitats included.
  - Surveys not conducted in heavy rain or winds > Beaufort 4.
- Butterflies:
  - Surveys on 2 x 50 m transects within AES habitats, plus two-minute timed observations of a 2 x 2 m quadrat at each transect end.
  - May–August, 10:00–16:00 GMT; conditions: minimum temperatures 13°C (sunny, >60% sky) or 17°C (cloudier), wind < Beaufort 4, no precipitation.
- Transects were filtered to ensure consistency across years:
  - Birds: 2006–2010 and 2012–2016.
  - Butterflies: 2007–2010 and 2014–2017.
- Excluded transects: those with no AES intervention or changes in AES uptake.
- Species: retained if present on >50% of selected transects across surveys; for birds, only adults within 10 m of transect recorded (not in flight).
- Data processing: raw counts converted to maximum counts per transect per year to study interannual trends.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Maximum annual counts of birds or butterflies per species per transect per year.

## Data structure and content
- Files:
  - Hillesden_Bird_Abundance_2006-2016.csv
  - Hillesden_Butterfly_Abundance_2007-2017.csv
- Columns:
  - Species: for butterflies, vernacular names; for birds, BTO 5-letter codes.
  - SiteCode: transect identifier.
  - Year: study year.
  - MaxCount: maximum annual count across monthly visits.

## Quality control
- Field identification, counting, and mapping performed by experienced surveyors.
- Locations mapped using transect IDs (butterflies) or Ordnance Survey maps (~1:2000) (birds).
- Data digitised with error checking during and after entry.

## Provenance and funding
- Collected as part of a UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology project.
- Funded by Defra; analytical work funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under ASSIST (NE/N018125/1), jointly supported by NERC and BBSRC.

## Use and comparability
- Suitable for analyzing interannual trends across two AES phases.
- Enables comparison with national schemes (BBS for birds, WCBMS for butterflies).
- Represents a consistent subset of Hillesden’s broader biological survey data, focused on long-running, consistently surveyed transects.
