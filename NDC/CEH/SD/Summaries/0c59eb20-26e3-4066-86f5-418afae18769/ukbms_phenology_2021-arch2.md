# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- It relies on volunteers and has monitored butterfly population changes across the UK since 1976, with over 2500 active sites annually.
- Data from all sampling methods are analyzed together to inform status and trends in biodiversity and policy questions.
- The monitoring framework supports multiple components and aims to provide standardized outputs for environmental health assessment.

## Data collection framework
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route line transects, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) across ~2000 sites.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits per year (min 2 in July/August); ~800 squares sampled annually.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focused on specific species.
- All data types are analyzed together to produce a unified UKBMS dataset.

## Phenology data and metrics
- Phenology refers to timing of adult butterfly flight periods across sites and years.
- Reliable phenology metrics are derived from standard transects with weekly counts; WCBS data are limited for phenology.
- Metrics include first/last recording dates, peak date and count, flight period length, mean flight date, and flight period standard deviation (synchronization), with additional handling for multi-voltine and uni-voltine species.
- For several species, separate metrics are provided for distinct flight periods (generations) where feasible; limitations arise from overlapping generations and survey timing.
- The dataset provides multiple metrics per species-site-year-brood combination, where applicable.

## Quality control
- Field data are entered on standard forms and uploaded to the UKBMS database; automated checks flag suspicious values.
- Regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation, including checks for records outside known distributions or flight periods, unusually high abundances, and first-time site records.
- Data edits are made via queries and coordination with recorders to ensure data integrity.

## Details of this data download
- The download provides phenology data for all species across all sites/years with sufficient data, in CSV format.
- Most species have data for the entire flight season; thirteen species have additional separate data for two distinct flight periods when possible.
- Key columns include site identifiers, site name, grid reference, species information (binomial and common names), year, brood, first/last/peak day and counts, mean flight date, flight period SD and range, and number of broods.
