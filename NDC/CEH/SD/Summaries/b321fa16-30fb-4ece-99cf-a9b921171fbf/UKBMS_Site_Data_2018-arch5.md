# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview and purpose
- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- It relies on volunteers to collect annual data on butterfly population status through site-based monitoring and 1km square sampling.
- The dataset is a key resource for understanding butterfly population changes and informing biodiversity policy; it covers the United Kingdom since 1976 and includes over 2,500 active sites each year.

## Data collection components
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km, ~45 minutes to 2 hours), recording all butterfly species in a 5 m band weekly from April to September (about 26 counts/year); ~2,000 sites sampled annually.
- Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or methods.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): transect methodology applied to stratified-random 1 km squares; 2–4 visits per year; ~750 squares sampled annually; designed to better sample common habitats such as farmland.

## Data and trend analysis
- Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Site indices are combined into species indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weighting to reflect the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year.
- Data from all components are integrated to estimate seasonal patterns and generate overall indices, balancing observed data with extrapolated data.

## Quality control
- Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods); regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
- Further automated/manual validation targets out-of-range ranges, records outside distribution, first-time site records, and extreme differences; corrections are made through targeted queries and coordination with coordinators or recorders.

## Data download details
- The download provides location and attribute data for UK sites monitored from 1976 to 2018; sensitive site data are excluded; delivered as a CSV.
- Key columns include: Site number, Site name, Grid reference, Easting, Northing, Length, Country, No. of sections, No. of years surveyed, First year surveyed, Last year surveyed, Survey type (UKBMS or WCBS).

## Licence and attribution
- Data are under the Open Government Licence (OGL), allowing free use with attribution.
- Reports/publications must cite the dataset with its DOI, and include the attribution: Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.
- Since 2017, submitters generally consent to open access of survey data; if historic data restrictions arise, users should contact the UKBMS team.

## Collaboration and contact details
- UKBMS partners offer guidance and interpretation of outputs and are open to collaboration, including co-authorship on publications.
