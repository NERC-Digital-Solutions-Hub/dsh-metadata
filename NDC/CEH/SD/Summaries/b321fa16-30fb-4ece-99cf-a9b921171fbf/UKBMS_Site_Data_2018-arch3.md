# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Relies on volunteers; provides annual data on butterfly population status across the UK since 1976; currently >2,500 active sites per year.
- Data support understanding of insect population changes and inform biodiversity policy questions.
- Sampling framework includes: standard Pollard walks (weekly), reduced-effort surveys for habitat-specialist species, and the Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS).

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Site indices are weighted to form species-level indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with additional weighting based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
- All counts across Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS are used to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate counts to account for gaps, with observed data given greater influence.

## Quality control
- Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker before uploading to a central database.
- Automated checks in data entry systems flag anomalies; regional transect coordinators review records.
- Additional validation checks address: records outside known distribution, outside flight periods, first-time site records, extreme or unusual abundances.
- Data edits are made through queries and coordination with recorders as needed.
