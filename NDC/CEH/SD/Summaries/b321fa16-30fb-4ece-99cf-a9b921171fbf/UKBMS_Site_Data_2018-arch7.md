# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- A UK-wide, volunteer-based monitoring program organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
- Since 1976, it collects annual butterfly population data across the UK from site-based transects and randomly sampled 1 km squares.
- Data support understanding of butterfly population changes and inform biodiversity policy; used to derive abundance indices (relative measures) across species.
- >2,500 actively recorded sites each year; results from different components are analyzed together.

## Data collection and structure
- Three components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed 2–4 km routes, 5 m wide belt, ~26 counts per year, ~2,000 sites annually.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts, or alternative methods.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–4 visits per year, ~750 squares annually.
- Data are combined to produce species-level indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
- Data cover the UK and are aggregated across all components to produce seasonal counts and broader trend indicators.

## Spatial data and attributes
- Spatial coverage includes site locations across the UK with coordinate information for GIS use.
- Data download includes:
  - Site number, site name
  - Grid reference (6-figure accuracy) and start transect coordinates (easting/northing)
  - Transect length (m)
  - Country, number of sections
  - Years surveyed, first and last year surveyed
  - Survey type (UKBMS standard transect or WCBS)
- Sensitive sites are excluded from the download.

## Quality control and processing
- Field data collected on standard forms; entered online via UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight period).
- Regional transect coordinators perform validation; continuous review during the season.
- Further automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range distributions, first-time site records, and comparability to typical site patterns.
- Corrections are made through queries and edits to the main UKBMS dataset when needed.
