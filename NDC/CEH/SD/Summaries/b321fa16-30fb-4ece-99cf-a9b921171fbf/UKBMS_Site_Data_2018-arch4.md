# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). It relies on volunteers and delivers annual data on butterfly population status across the UK since 1976.
  - It integrates multiple monitoring components to produce a single dataset used for biodiversity status and trend policy questions.

- Data content and scope
  - Provides location and attribute data for UK sites monitored under UKBMS from 1976 to 2018 (sensitive sites excluded).
  - Data are delivered as a CSV file and are open for reuse under the Open Government Licence (OGL).

- Data structure and fields (key columns)
  - Site number, Site name, Gridreference, Easting, Northing
  - Length (transect length in metres)
  - Country, No. Sections, No. Yrs surveyed
  - First year surveyed, Last year surveyed
  - Survey type (standard UKBMS transect or WCBS)

- Sampling framework and components
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km) with 26 weekly counts April–September at ~2,000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts focusing on specific species.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects; 2–4 visits per year, 750 squares annually; emphasizes common habitats like farmland.

- Data quality control and validation
  - Field data collected on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalous counts or records outside known flight periods; regional coordinators perform ongoing validation.
  - Further automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range ranges, atypical abundances, new site records; edits are made to the main UKBMS dataset as needed.

- Data processing and indices
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Collated indices for species produced with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with site-year weighting by the proportion of the species flight period observed.
  - Counts from all components are used to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps; weighting gives observed data more influence than extrapolated data.

- Licence, attribution, and reuse
  - Data downloaded under the Open Government Licence (OGL); allows free use with few conditions.
  - Must cite the dataset with the provided DOI in publications and include the attribution: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, JNCC.
  - Since 2017, submitters have agreed to data being available under OGL; historical data may have third-party IP restrictions in rare cases; notify if objections arise.

- Collaboration and contact
  - UKBMS partners offer collaboration, interpretation support, and potential co-authorship on publications arising from UKBMS data.
