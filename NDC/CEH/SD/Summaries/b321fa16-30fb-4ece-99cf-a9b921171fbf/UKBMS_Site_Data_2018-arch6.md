## About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- It relies on volunteers and conducts site-based monitoring plus random 1km square sampling to track butterfly populations across the UK since 1976.
- Data sources include: standard Pollard walks (weekly transects), reduced-effort surveys for habitat specialist species, and the Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS).
- Over 2,500 actively recorded sites are surveyed each year.
- Outputs from all components are analyzed together to understand trends and inform biodiversity policy.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- Data are expressed as abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts.
- Indices cover counts from all components (Pollard walks, reduced surveys, WCBS) to model seasonal patterns and estimate yearly population trends.
- The Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) is used to produce species indices, with site-year weighting based on the proportion of the species flight period surveyed.
- Seasonal counts are extrapolated to account for gaps in recording, with weighting giving more influence to observed data than extrapolated data.
- Data are sufficient to analyze trends in butterfly abundance and support biodiversity status assessments.

## Quality control

- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker software.
- Automated checks flag inconsistencies (e.g., unusually high counts or records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators review data for each site and conduct ongoing validation during the season.
- Additional automated and manual validation checks test for out-of-range distributions, atypical first-time site records, extreme abundances, and unusually divergent site-year patterns.
- Data edits are made following queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders as needed.
