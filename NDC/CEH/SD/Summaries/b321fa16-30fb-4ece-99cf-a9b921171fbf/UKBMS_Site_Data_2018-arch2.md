# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview and purpose
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteer data collection to provide annual data on butterfly population status across the UK since 1976.
  - More than 2,500 active sites contribute data each year; results support understanding biodiversity trends and policy questions.
  - Outputs come from combining results of different components to monitor changes in butterfly populations.

- Monitoring components
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects; record all species within a 5 m wide belt; ~26 counts per year; typically 45 minutes to 2 hours; ~2,000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or activities.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): transect methodology in 1 km squares; 2–4 visits per year (including July/August and spring); ~750 squares annually; established to sample common habitats like farmland.

- Data and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population counts.
  - Site indices are combined into species-level indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting to reflect the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year.
  - The approach uses all counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate for gaps; observed data are given more weight.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
  - Automatic checks flag data entry errors; regional transect coordinators validate records and perform ongoing checks.
  - Additional automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range records, flights outside known distribution, first-time site records, and atypical counts.
  - Data corrections are made through queries and coordination with coordinators or recorders.

- Data download details
  - This download covers location and attribute data for UKBMS-monitored sites from 1976 to 2018; sensitive sites are excluded.
  - Provided as a CSV file.
  - Columns include site number, site name, grid reference, easting/northing, length, country, number of sections, years surveyed, first/last year surveyed, and survey type (standard UKBMS or WCBS).

- Licence and attribution
  - Dataset is provided under the Open Government Licence (OGL).
  - Must include full citation with the DOI in publications; attribution statement required: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.
  - Since 2017, submitters agreed to OGL; while historic data generally available, there may be IP restrictions; authors should contact if issues arise.

- Collaboration and contact
  - UKBMS partners welcome collaboration and can contribute to interpretation, publications, and conferences.

- Analyst-focused takeaways
  - The dataset provides a long-term, standardized framework for monitoring butterfly biodiversity from multiple data collection methods.
  - Data are relative indices with processes to combine across components, enabling temporal trend analysis.
  - Quality control is layered (field forms, online validation, regional checks, automated and manual validation) to maintain dataset integrity.
  - Open licensing and explicit attribution facilitate broader data reuse and cross-dataset integration, aligning with challenges around expanding data value and accessibility.
