# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy up to 2007 for Countryside Survey.
- Tracks the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify sampling and derive national habitat estimates.
- Highlights country-specific reporting, data products, and the data governance implications for time-series ecological data.

## Context and Purpose
- Countryside Survey began with a national ecological sampling framework intended to produce representative estimates of habitat areas across Great Britain.
- A stratified, random sampling approach was essential to minimize bias and capture ecological variation across land types.
- The ITE Land Classification provides the stratification framework used across survey decades (1978–2007) to guide sample selection and reporting.

## Land Classification: Evolution and Structure
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification)
  - 32 land classes created using environmental attributes; sampling unit of 1 km squares.
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to group quadrats into vegetation-type classes; a center 1 km square classified with surrounding four squares also classified.
  - Approx. 6039 km2 classified; eight samples per class (256 total) for national habitat area estimates.
- 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
  - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (384 total) to improve estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every 1 km square in GB (All Squares approach).
  - 508 squares surveyed; added Land Cover Map; national estimates based on 1990 classification with some square reclassification.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; CS1990 adjustments)
  - Classification extended to enable Scotland-only reporting; total classes increased to 40.
- 2000 (CS2000 Revisions)
  - Adjustments to support separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland).
  - Sub-division of classes into country-unit variants; aggregation of underrepresented rump classes within each country.
  - 40 strata formed; additional squares allocated to ensure representation; upland habitat module introduced for England/Wales to improve upland estimates.
- 2007 (CS2007 Developments; Wales-focused reporting)
  - Wales-specific reporting formalized; five new country-unit classes introduced (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total of 45 strata.
  - 43 additional Welsh squares added; minimum of 6 squares in each Welsh class.
  - England adjustments made due to loss of Welsh squares; upland module expanded (30 upland squares) to improve Wales/England upland estimates.
- National estimates consideration
  - Changing land classifications affects cross-survey consistency; preferred to use the latest classification for country estimates to maintain internal consistency, while older classifications may be used for cross-survey comparability.

## Field Sampling Design and Data Collection
- Core design: stratified, random sampling using the ITE Land Classes as strata.
- Sample units: 1 km squares; historically, sampling tied to a grid framework with center squares and surrounding squares classified to stabilize strata descriptions.
- Sample sizes over time
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class) across 32 classes.
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class) across 32 classes.
  - CS1990: 508 squares surveyed; all GB squares included in revised framework.
  - CS2000: Expanded to support country-unit estimates; total country-focused samples increased; final distribution across 40–40+ strata, with Wales receiving substantial representation.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused refinements increased to 45 strata (with country-unit sub-classes); total GB sample squares adjusted to 591.
- Upland module (CS2000)
  - Added 30 squares specifically to upland and marginal upland land classes for England and Wales, improving habitat estimate accuracy in upland areas.
- Outputs and data products
  - Main reports: Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990 main report), CS2000 (UK results), CS2007 (UK results).
  - Land Classification maps and accompanying tables (e.g., land-class summaries, sampling distributions by class and country).

## Country Reporting and Comparability
- England & Wales vs Scotland: framework evolved to produce separate country estimates.
- Wales-only reporting: introduced to meet policy/legislation needs; required sub-division and reallocation of samples to ensure representative Welsh coverage.
- Cross-year comparability: national estimates depend on consistent use and documentation of the Land Classification version; crosswalks and methodological notes are essential for time-series analyses.

## Data Products and Documentation
- Key outputs include:
  - Tables detailing the number of squares by Land Class and by year.
  - Maps illustrating revised Land Class distributions and sample squares (CS2000 and CS2007 era).
  - Published reports: CS1990 main report, CS2000 UK Results, CS2007 UK Results.
- Metadata considerations
  - Documentation of Land Classification version used for estimates is critical for replication and comparability.
  - Records of class subdivisions (country-unit variants) and additional Welsh/ upland sampling are essential for proper data interpretation.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Implications
- Versioned classifications: maintain clear metadata on Land Classification versions (32, 40, 45 classes) and country-unit variants.
- Time-series integrity: ensure cross-year comparability through documentation of reclassifications and sampling frame changes.
- Country-specific data handling: manage Wales and Scotland reporting requirements, including sample allocation and class sub-divisions.
- Data archiving and provenance: preserve a record of the original sampling frames, reclassification decisions, and upland module data for reproducibility.
- Access and reuse: provide clear guidance on how to derive country-specific estimates from the Land Classification used in each survey year.

## Key Challenges and Considerations
- Incomplete alignment between evolving Land Classifications and time-series estimates.
- Ensuring adequate representation of new classes, especially in Wales, England, and uplands.
- Managing transferability and interoperability across years and across country boundaries.
- Balancing precision and practicality in sample sizes per class, particularly for minority classes.
