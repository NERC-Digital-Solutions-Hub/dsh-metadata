# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose
  - Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Demonstrates how the sampling design and land classification have evolved over 30 years to support robust trend analysis and country-specific environmental reporting.

- Core concepts
  - ITE Land Classification as the stratification basis for sampling.
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation across Great Britain.
  - Field surveys focused on vegetation, habitats, and landscape features, with sampling density and class composition adjusted over time to meet policy and regional reporting needs.

- The ITE Land Classification: origin and role
  - Classifies land based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to create homogeneous strata.
  - Early approach used centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; surrounding squares were assigned using a classification key.
  - Classification underpins the sampling framework, informing where and how many samples to collect in each land class.

- Timeline of key developments and sampling frameworks
  - 1978 (CS1978): Initial Land Classification with 32 classes derived from 1228 centre 1 km squares; each class had eight field samples (total 256 squares); four surrounding squares added per centre square to extend classification, totaling about 6039 km squares considered.
  - 1984 (CS1984): Second field survey; extended sampling to 12 km squares per land class (total 384) and retained eight squares from CS1978 per class.
  - 1990 (CS1990): All Squares Land Classification; environmental data integrated from all 1 km squares. 508 squares surveyed; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB. National estimates based on revised classification; extended to accommodate both scientific and policy needs.
  - 1998 (CS1998/CS2000 planning): Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to improve regional and local estimates; led to the need for separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and consideration of upland habitat reporting.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Introduced separate country-unit estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland) by sub-dividing classes into country-specific versions; 40 strata expanded to 40+ with 19 additional squares to ensure representation of new classes; extra sampling to balance representation across countries; uplands module added to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-focused adjustments to support Wales-only reporting post-devolution; added five new Welsh sub-classes creating 45 strata; increased Welsh sampling to ensure minimum representation in each Welsh class; some English classes retained with fewer samples due to precision concerns; overall framework adapted to produce robust Wales, England, and Scotland results.

- Wales, England, Scotland, and uplands: country-specific reporting
  - To support country-level environmental policy and legislation, the sampling framework was adapted to enable Wales-only and Scotland-only reporting.
  - Introduced country-unit versions of land classes and aggregated or subdivided classes as needed to maintain adequate sample sizes within each country.
  - Additional squares were allocated to ensure representation of new classes in each country (e.g., 19 additional in Wales; balancing adjustments in England).
  - A dedicated uplands module added 30 extra squares in upland and marginal upland areas to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates.

- Estimation approach and data usage
  - National estimates are derived from the mean habitat area per square within each land class multiplied by the total land area of that class.
  - For country estimates, sampling frames are adjusted to use country-specific class subdivisions, with aggregation where necessary to maintain sufficient sample sizes.
  - Changes in land classification impact the consistency of stock estimates; the report discusses maintaining comparability across surveys by choosing the most appropriate classification for a given reporting context (latest vs original 1990 classification).

- Key challenges and considerations for analysts
  - Achieving adequate data at local scales and ensuring representative stratification across diverse GB landscapes.
  - Managing classification changes that affect cross-survey comparability and national vs country-level reporting.
  - Allocating samples to balance representation across Welsh, English, and Scottish classes, especially after devolution and when introducing country-specific sub-classes.
  - Ensuring sufficient sample sizes in each land class to maintain precision, particularly for Wales and upland habitat estimates.
  - The evolution from 32 to 40 to 45 land classes reflects a trade-off between granularity and statistical stability across regions.

- Summary of survey scale and framework evolution
  - 1978: 256 samples across 32 land classes; use of 1 km squares as sampling units.
  - 1984: 384 samples; increased class coverage but still aligned with original framework.
  - 1990: 508 samples; nationwide alignment with a revised Land Classification and linkage to Land Cover Map.
  - 2000: 569 samples; introduction of country-unit estimates and expanded classes to accommodate England, Wales, and Scotland reporting, plus uplands module.
  - 2007: 591 samples; Wales-specific adjustments increasing Welsh class count and sample density; England classes adjusted to maintain overall precision; 45 strata in total for Countryside Survey reporting.
