# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Purpose: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners (representing CS data stewardship): CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys to maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land.
- Confidential policy serves the public interest; FOI/Environmental Information Regulations apply for release requests.

## Access and release: when and what precision is allowed
- Allowed releases without compromising confidentiality:
  - Identify whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to show which 10x10 km grid square contains each CS square.
- Precise release (six-digit grid references):
  - Only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, and only after CEH pre-processing to avoid release where possible.
  - If external release is approved, the requester must demonstrate that their data/IP confidentiality requirements are at least equal to or higher than CS data.
- Within-square data (maps of habitats, linear features) could enable location identification and are treated with the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Licensing conditions and data handling
- Licensees must:
  - Preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to approved individuals.
  - Use data for the defined project period; destroy data after licensing period ends.
  - Not release data to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
  - Not use data to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - Provide evidence of project management standards comparable to JCOP if requested.
  - For four-digit releases, comply with similar terms but without the higher IP confidentiality requirement; also must not attempt to derive precise locations.
  - Include clauses to prevent attempts to identify exact square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data; licences must be signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Pre-processing support:
  - CEH aims to assist internal CS partnership uses within reasonable timeframes.
  - External requests are considered case-by-case.
- Practical guidance:
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to using data.
  - CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, term-by-term.
