# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Overview
  - Aims to maximise utility of CS spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- Partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology CEH)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England (NE)
  - Welsh Government (WG)
  - The Scottish Government (SG)
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
  - Forestry Commission (FC)
  - Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
  - Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Circumstances for release and precision
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to show whether squares fall within predetermined areas.
  - Six-digit grid references require CEH processing to avoid release; only in very exceptional circumstances may six-digit data be provided under licence.
  - Spatial data from within survey squares could risk identifying square locations and are treated under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and access restricted to authorised individuals for the agreed purpose.
  - Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end of the period.
  - No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If required, licensees may need to show evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; license terms prohibit attempts to derive precise locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH makes exceptional release decisions on behalf of NERC.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
  - Rejections follow statutory Act and Regulations procedures; CEH provides annual reports on access requests and decisions.
  - CEH should be consulted by CS partners before committing to data covered by the policy to help define requirements and appropriate use; involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
