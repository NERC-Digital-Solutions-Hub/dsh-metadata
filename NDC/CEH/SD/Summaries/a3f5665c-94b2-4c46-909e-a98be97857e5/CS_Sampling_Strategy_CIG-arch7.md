# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field work from 1978 to 2007.
- Explains how data are stratified, collected, classified, and used to estimate national, regional, and country-specific habitat areas.
- Highlights adjustments for Wales and Scotland, and considerations for consistency of national estimates across surveys.

## ITE Land Classification: origins and concept
- The classification provides an environmental stratification of Great Britain to guide ecological sampling.
- Early work (1970s) moved from quadrats to broader land-surface classification using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) rather than species.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) helped group 1 km squares into land classes based on environmental characteristics.
- Initial framework: 1 km square sampling with a center square of a 15 x 15 km grid classified, plus a surrounding set of four squares, producing a total classified set of 6039 km squares.

## Development timeline and sampling framework

- 1978 (CS1978) - Initial Land Classification and field survey
  - 32 land classes generated from ISA; eight samples per class ( total 256 1 km squares).
  - National habitat estimates derived by: mean habitat area per class × area of that class.

- 1984 (CS1984) - Second field survey
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (384 total).
  - Estimates still based on the original 1978 Land Classification.

- 1990 (CS1990) - All Squares Land Classification and third field survey
  - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB; urban/sea corrections added.
  - 508 squares surveyed; added satellite-derived Land Cover Map linkage.
  - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- 1998 (CS1998/CS1990 revision) - Expanded and refined classification
  - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to support regional and local estimates.
  - Move toward a more comprehensive GB-wide classification (every square classified with surrogates for climatic/geologic factors).

## Separate country estimates and Wales adjustments (CS2000)

- Rationale
  - Policy and devolution needs required separate estimates for England with Wales and for Scotland.
  - Some land classes crossed country boundaries, so adaptations were needed to produce country-specific estimates.

- Key changes
  - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions (England & Wales; Scotland).
  - Aggregation of rare sub-classes within a country to maintain representation (creating 40 strata, then later adjustments to 45).
  - Additional sampling: 19 extra squares to ensure all new classes are represented in each country; further 11 squares added to balance England and Wales sampling.
  - Wales-specific adjustments: sub-division of Land Class 17 in Wales to improve Wales results; two Welsh squares replaced Isle of Man squares for country-specific reporting.
  - An upland habitat survey module added in CS2000 to improve upland estimates in England and Wales.

- Outputs
  - CS2000 total sample allocation and stratum distributions summarized in tables and maps (England & Wales combined; Scotland separately).

## Wales-focused changes and CS2007

- Welsh-only reporting need post-devolution prompted further refinements.
- Changes implemented for 2007 (CS2007)
  - Land Classes subdivided into five Wales-specific country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), increasing the number of strata to 45.
  - Additional Welsh samples: 43 more squares to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - England adjustments: no corresponding increase; two English classes (5e, 15e) end up with 4 squares per class.
  - England, Wales, Scotland sampling maps updated accordingly (Figure 6 and Figure 7).

- CS2007 sampling totals (England & Wales, Scotland)
  - England continues with substantial sampling but with some reductions in specific classes.
  - Wales shows a marked increase to improve Wales-only estimates.
  - Scotland maintains its own sampling framework within the updated regional structure.

## Uplands module (CS2000)
- An additional 30 squares placed in uplands and marginal uplands of England and Wales to improve habitat estimates in high-altitude areas.
- Supports more accurate country-based upland habitat reporting.

## How estimates are produced and considerations for consistency

- National estimates are derived by combining class-level metrics with land-class area proportions.
- Two approaches to national estimates discussed:
  - Use the latest classification to compute GB estimates (preferred for within-survey consistency).
  - Use the original 1990 Land Classification for cross-survey consistency (less preferred for GB-wide consistency across surveys).
- Table 4 (Original vs. latest classification) illustrates how sample sizes per class have changed across surveys, underscoring potential shifts in national estimates when classifications change.

## Key implications for GIS and data work

- The Sampling Strategy defines a robust, stratified sampling framework anchored in an evolving land classification system.
- GIS work relies on:
  - The 1 km square units and their land-class assignments (varied across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - Country-unit subdivisions to produce England & Wales and Scotland-specific estimates.
  - Upland module additions to enhance accuracy in highland areas.
- Data standardization and cross-survey comparability are addressed via explicit notes on classification changes and the preferred approach for national estimates.
- The series provides a historical time series of land class distributions and sampling intensities, valuable for change detection and trend analysis in habitat and land-use mapping.
