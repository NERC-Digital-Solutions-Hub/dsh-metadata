# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIROMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview and purpose
- Defines guidelines for field surveying of rural environment data in Great Britain (related to the 1976 Project 424 ecological survey).
- Aims to create a standard, comparable data baseline across 384 squares (12 from each of 32 land classes) and to assess changes over time via ground survey and aerial photography.
- Data items are chosen to be practical, compatible with previous surveys, and relevant to landscape objectives; intended to support future monitoring and partial replacement sampling.
- Emphasizes consistency, explicit recording, and the need for qualifiers when a surveyor item is atypical or doubtful.

## Field planning and logistics
- Squares are grouped into seven survey groups with teams from six ITE research stations; each square is allocated to a team, with liaison for some squares.
- Typical survey time per square is limited; prioritizes travel efficiency to avoid duplicative visits and overtime.
- Planning options include various travel/overnight arrangements to cover 1–2 squares per day or a small group per week.
- Early permissions from landowners are crucial to access all parts of a square; authorities encourage prior contact but accept formal permissions to avoid wasted work.

## Equipment
- Minimal equipment; focus is on mapping and recording rather than measurement.
- Provided items: FABs (Data Recording Booklets), 1:10,000 maps, films, field handouts, colored pens, location maps, navigation tools, ITE identity card, clipboard, pencils, weather gear, reference books, and camera.

## Suggested field procedure
- On arrival: assess access and potential problems; orient to the square.
- Seek permissions for the entire square before starting.
- Choose a route that allows full square coverage.
- After surveying: review records for omissions, ensure clear presentation, and leave time for final checks.

## Permissions
- Multiple reasons: legal access, goodwill with farmers/owners, and background information.
- Gaining permission is essential before surveying; refusals late in the process waste effort.
- Prior contact can help, but may introduce delays; a standard information handout and an ITE identity card aid the process.
- Ownership information should be updated; known owner names/addresses from prior surveys should be supplemented.

## Data recording
- The survey is primarily a mapping exercise; data are annotated on 6" (1:10,000) maps using predefined data codes.
- A coding system combines numeric codes in designated boxes to produce a compact representation of features (e.g., boundaries, habitats).
- Field decisions are made by the surveyor in the field; best judgments are recorded, with qualifiers if needed.
- Minimum mapable unit: 0.25 ha in length 0.2 km; ensure even edges/smallest corners are mapped and coded.

## The Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) and data sheets
- Each square’s data are compiled into a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB), linked to the 6" maps.
- FAB sections include:
  - Cover: series number, location, and basic metadata.
  - Ownership: land ownership, tenant vs owner, and a cooperation score for owners.
  - Farmer/Landowner Information: contextual background; interview notes are encouraged with a simple, non-intrusive approach.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: features such as cliffs, rocks, peat, erosion, water bodies, rivers, ditches, springs, levers, and shorelines.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: ground cover types, crops, heath/moorland, grasses, sedges, aquatic vegetation, and related species lists.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: woodland types, tree/shrub categories, species codes, age, density, regeneration, and related features (hedgerows, belts, plantations, etc.).
  - Boundaries: boundary types (walls, hedges, fences), descriptions, and stockproof status; mappings focus on practical boundary delineation.
  - Recreation: formal and informal recreational uses and facilities.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, uses, descriptions, and infrastructure like roads, tracks, footpaths, signs, pipelines, etc.
  - Photography: five photographs per square with precise locations and directions noted.
- The FAB is designed to accommodate combinations of codes to describe mosaic or complex unit areas; color coding is used for clarity when needed.

## Data items, categories, and codes (highlights)
- Cover types (example categories): Amenity grassland, Permanent pasture, Upland grassland, Moorland/heath, Maritime grassland, Aquatic vegetation, Fen/Bog, Crops (e.g., cereals, potatoes), Vacant/Abandoned land, Fallow land, Burnt moor, and various taxonomic groupings.
- Species and flora: extensive lists (e.g., grasses, rushes, sedges, Calluna, Molinia, various forbs) with proportion and dominance coding.
- Forestry/Woodland: categories for scattered trees, coppice, copse, line of trees, belts, hedgerows, individual trees; production categories (amenity, recreation, shelter, etc.); age coding and growth status (natural regeneration, underplanting).
- Boundaries: diverse types (mortared walls, hedges, fences, stone walls, mixed boundaries) with descriptive codes and stockproof status.
- Ownership/tenure: codes to indicate owner, tenant, and the level of cooperation or willingness to assist future surveys.
- Physiography/Inland water/Coastal: detailed codes for cliffs, rocks, peat types, erosion features, water bodies, rivers, ditches, springs, levees, shores, substrates, and related morphological features.
- Boundaries and edge coding: perpendicular boundary delineation to show spatial relationships; dotted lines used for future notes where needed.
- Colours: prescribed color schemes to represent different land-use types and curtilages on maps when coding becomes unwieldy.

## Data quality, decisions, and governance
- Field decisions should be made by the most knowledgeable surveyor on site; recording decisions must be justified or qualified if ambiguous.
- The dataset emphasizes consistency with prior surveys to ensure comparability over time.
- Documentation of changes, new features, and post-survey notes are encouraged to support transparency and future data governance.
- Updates to ownership and other dynamic attributes should be tracked and shared with the coordinating center (Merlewood) to support ongoing data integrity.

## Data storage, sharing, and provenance
- Data are compiled into FABs and associated with 6" mapping to enable spatial analysis and long-term comparability.
- After collection, batches are organized and sent to Merlewood; ideally, data are not transcribed to alternate maps unless necessary to preserve original data integrity.
- The handbook envisions an archival standard with consistent metadata (location, series number, ownership, and interview notes), enabling discoverability and reuse by future data stewards.

## Special challenges and considerations for data stewards
- Incomplete understanding of user needs: the field handbook aims to capture user-relevant data while remaining practical in field conditions.
- Interoperability and formats: data are tied to 1:10,000 maps and FAB forms; future data governance may require digital equivalents and reference schemas to ensure interoperability with other datasets.
- Timeliness and access: permissions and landowner cooperation can affect data timeliness and completeness; governance should address access controls, licensing, and provenance.
- Legacy data and updates: the document provides a framework for documenting changes over time (e.g., ownership shifts since 1977/78) to support longitudinal analyses.

## End-to-end workflow (summary)
- Prepare teams, plan square assignments, and secure permissions.
- Collect field data using standardized FABs and 1:10,000 maps; apply coding scheme to annotate features.
- Capture photography with precise geolocations and directions.
- Review and quality-check data in the FAB; ensure complete coverage and consistency.
- Transmit completed FABs to Merlewood; preserve original maps and data integrity.
- Use the assembled data for landscape assessments, baseline establishment, and future monitoring.

## Key governance takeaways for Data Stewards
- The handbook embodies an early, structured approach to data standardization, metadata, and provenance through the FAB and coding system.
- It highlights the need for consistent vocabularies, explicit field decisions, and process-oriented data management to enable reproducibility and longitudinal comparisons.
- To enhance current data stewardship, consider formalizing a digital data model, persistent identifiers for squares and features, metadata schemas, versioning, and an explicit data-sharing license regime aligned with modern standards.
