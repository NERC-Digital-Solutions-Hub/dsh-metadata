# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Purpose: establish a robust, time-series monitoring framework for UK countryside habitats to inform policy evaluation and future decisions.
  - Core method: stratified, random sampling using the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative coverage of Britain’s varied landscapes.
  - Outputs: national and country-specific habitat estimates, trends, and change statistics, published in successive Countryside Survey reports.

- Key concepts and foundations
  - Stratified sampling: divides land into discreet strata (land classes) to reduce bias and ensure representative sampling across ecological variation.
  - Classification origins: the ITE Land Classification began in the 1970s by grouping areas based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) rather than purely on species data.
  - Sampling unit: 1 km x 1 km squares; early strategy used centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares allocated to classes for classification.

- Evolution of the sampling strategy (timeline)
  - 1978 (First GB survey): 32 land classes; eight samples per class; total 256 squares; field work on vegetation and soils.
  - 1984 (Land use survey): expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); larger-scale land-use mapping incorporated.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification): classification updated to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; linked to first land-cover map.
  - 1998 (CS2000): major revision to enable separate country reporting; land classes increased to 40; sampling extended to ensure country-level estimates; new Wales and Scotland considerations introduced; separate country estimates formalized.
  - 2000 (CS2000 sampling framework): England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man addressed; more squares allocated to represent new classes; introduction of separate country units (England with Wales; Scotland) for estimates; uplands module added to improve accuracy for upland habitats.
  - 2007 (CS2007): further Wales-specific adjustments for country reporting; Welsh subdivisions created (five new country-unit classes); total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares added; England adjustments balanced the sampling design.

- Stratification, country-specific reporting, and sample allocation
  - Original 32 land classes expanded and subdivided to create country-unit variants (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to support Wales-only reporting and England-with-Wales reporting.
  - Aggregation and subdivision used to maintain adequate representation in each country, resulting in a total of up to 45 strata for CS2007.
  - Isle of Man samples removed from country estimates and replaced with additional England samples to maintain country-focused estimates.

- Uplands and additional modules
  - Uplands module (CS2000): added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland classes to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - Wales-focused enhancements: more Welsh squares and Welsh-class subdivisions to meet policy and legislative needs for Wales-only reporting.

- Data, estimates, and comparability
  - National estimates derive from class-level means scaled by the land-class area, enabling “stock” estimates of habitat features.
  - Changing land classifications across surveys affects cross-survey comparability; two approaches discussed:
    - Use latest classification for national estimates (preferred for consistency within surveys).
    - Use original classification (e.g., 1990) for cross-survey consistency, acknowledging reduced comparability across time.
  - The strategy emphasizes maintaining time-series integrity while updating classifications to reflect policy and geographic reporting needs.

- Outputs and documentation
  - Main reporting milestones include Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990 main report), CS2000 (UK results), and CS2007 (UK results).
  - Documentation provides detailed justification for sampling decisions, country-specific subdivision, and the evolution of the Land Classification system.

- Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates the value of a flexible, country-aware sampling design that can adapt to devolution and policy needs while preserving a coherent time series.
  - Highlights the importance of stratification to capture ecological diversity and avoid sampling bias.
  - Illustrates challenges of data comparability, the need for metadata and governance when classifications change, and the role of additional modules (e.g., uplands) to improve precision for targeted habitat types.
  - Underlines the trade-offs between open data, metadata completeness, and the practicalities of public sharing of datasets used for national estimates.
