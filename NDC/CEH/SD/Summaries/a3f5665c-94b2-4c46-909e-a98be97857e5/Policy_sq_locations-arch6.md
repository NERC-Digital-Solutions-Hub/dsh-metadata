# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land in the future.
- Public-interest rationale; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 via CEH.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) can be released under licence to indicate approximate square locations.
- Six-digit grid references require exceptional justification; CEH may determine pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing precise locations; very exceptional cases may allow external release if IP/confidentiality level is comparable or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and are released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## License terms and data handling
- Licensees must: preserve confidentiality, store data securely, restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need, and use data only for the agreed project.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and confirmed in writing at the end of the licence.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; location data must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.
- If requested, licensees may need evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP barriers than six-digit releases; license terms prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases according to policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; licences require sign-off by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal data-use needs (pre-processing) within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before using data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid and is negotiated case-by-case.
