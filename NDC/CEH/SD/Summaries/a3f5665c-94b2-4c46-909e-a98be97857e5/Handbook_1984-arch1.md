# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview
- A field survey program initiated from the 1976 Project 424 Ecological Survey of Great Britain to establish a baseline for land use, habitat, and landscape change.
- Builds on a multivariate land-class framework; expanded to re-visit original sites and assess changes via ground survey and aerial photography (ITE 899).
- Aims to produce consistent, compatible data across time, enabling future comparisons and targeting a range of landscape objectives.
- Emphasises practical field recording, documentation, data quality, and making datasets discoverable with metadata.

## Sampling Design and Objectives
- Sampling comprises 384 squares across Great Britain (12 per 32 land classes; 1 km x 1 km grid), with some exceptions where original squares could not be surveyed.
- Data items include land cover, land use, habitat features, and landscape characteristics aligned with previous surveys for comparability.
- Additional sampling from each land class enhances statistical confidence and supports future partial replacement sampling.

## Field Organization and Planning
- Six ITE research stations lead survey teams; each square assigned to teams with liaison from Merlewood.
- Approximately 56 squares per team; planning options consider travel, overnight stays, and efficient routing.
- Key planning considerations:
  - Avoid double-travel where possible due to cost and time.
  - Travel-based costs assumed; no overnight subsistence unless necessary.
  - Several planning configurations (single-square daily travel, two squares with one overnight, or larger blocks with periodic travel).

## Equipment and Permissions
- Minimal equipment required; focus on mapping and recording rather than on heavy measurement.
- Equipment includes FAB booklets, 1:10,000 maps, film, pens, maps, navigation gear, ITE ID card, clipboards, weather gear, reference books, and camera.
- Permissions: obtain access permissions for entire square before surveying; maintaining goodwill with landowners/farmers is essential to avoid wasted effort.
- A farmer/landowner information sheet and an ownership data sheet are used to log ownership, tenant status, and cooperation levels.

## Data Recording Framework (FAB)
- Data recording is primarily a mapping exercise on 6" (1:10,000) maps using predefined data codes; combinations of numeric codes are stored in boxes to produce alpha-numeric entries.
- Each square is documented in a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) alongside the maps; page order is flexible but all essential data must be captured.
- Decision-making is field-based; surveyors must record decisions and provide qualifiers where necessary, with emphasis on avoiding deferred choices in processing.

## Data Coding and Mapping
- Mapping units and codes are designed to be efficient and interoperable with prior surveys; a single alpha code may represent a combination of numeric codes (e.g., boundary types, cover types, and other features).
- Boundaries, land cover, and habitat features are annotated with codes on the map; specific conventions are provided for boundary marking, edge coding, and the use of colour to reduce clutter.
- Minimum mappable unit and edge considerations:
  - Minimum mapable area: 0.5 ha; minimum length: 0.2 km.
  - Ensure the smallest field corner and square edges are captured and coded in full.

## FAB Sections in Detail

- Ownership
  - Record ownership of all parts of the square; assign owner numbers to land units; include tenant vs. owner statuses.
  - Rate the owner’s cooperativeness/helpfulness on a scale (0 to 3) to inform potential future surveys.

- Farmer / Landowner Information
  - Conduct informal conversations with at least one farmer per square (preferably the principal landholder).
  - Use a non-intrusive approach; summarize conversations if necessary; connect conversation to ownership codes for future reference.

- Physiography / Inland Water / Coastal
  - Document physiographic features (cliffs, rock outcrops, peat, erosion, ground leveling, etc.) and inland water/coastal features (lakes, ponds, rivers, ditches, springs, estuaries, etc.).
  - Use a standardized code set (e.g., cliffs, peat types, river/ditch types, springs, leaks) to describe and map landscape context.

- Agriculture / Natural Vegetation
  - Capture ground cover types (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, crops) and their proportions.
  - Record crop details, livestock presence, and management practices (e.g., silage/hay, fertilization) with coded qualifiers.
  - Include height classes and species when relevant; note areas within curtilages and differentiate non-agricultural curtilages from broader land uses.

- Forestry / Woodland / Trees
  - Record woodland features, stands, coppice, scrub, belts, hedgerows, and individual trees where appropriate.
  - Use codes for cover types, species, age, proportion, and management status (unmanaged, planted, natural regeneration, underplanting, etc.).
  - Distinguish trees by height, crown cover, and dotting patterns (scattered vs. individual trees).

- Boundaries
  - Document boundary types (mortared walls, hedges, fences, stone/earth banks, gaps filled, stockproof lines, etc.) and descriptions to augment code entries.
  - Record boundary conditions and alterations (filled gaps, derelict boundaries) with qualitative notes and percentage measures where applicable.

- Recreation
  - Catalog formal and informal recreational uses and signs, including golf courses, playgrounds, parks, and other accessible lands.

- Buildings / Structures / Communications
  - Map built environments, roads, tracks, footpaths, pipelines (above ground), signs, and other infrastructure.
  - Distinguish between residential, commercial, industrial, public services, educational, religious, and institutional buildings; use color conventions to enhance readability.
  - Capture road types (tarmac, tracks, verges), footpaths (exclusive and shared), and information on barriers or access restrictions.

- Photography
  - Take five photographs per square to capture representative views; record exact photo locations and directions on the FAB front or map.
  - Prioritize viewpoints that reflect the square and its surroundings without excessive sky or extraneous landscape.

## Post-Survey Procedures and Data Management
- Upon completion, verify that all features have been recorded; avoid transposition onto new maps unless absolutely necessary.
- Notify Merlewood as batches of FAB sheets are completed; arrange timely transport of completed squares.
- Emphasize data provenance and the potential for datasets to be made discoverable with metadata.

## Practical Considerations for Analysts
- Data at the right scale and accessible storage are recognized challenges; the handbook emphasizes standardization, documentation, and cross-survey compatibility to support robust analyses.
- The coding framework is designed to unify data from multiple sources and formats, facilitating integration into larger datasets for analysis, modeling, and trend assessment.
- The methodology supports producing evidence-based insights about landscape changes, land use shifts, and habitat alterations over time, aligning with the Analyst archetype’s goals of identifying correlations, informing decisions, and predicting impacts.
