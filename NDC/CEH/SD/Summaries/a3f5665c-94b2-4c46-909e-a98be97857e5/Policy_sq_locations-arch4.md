# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and its Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserves representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and continued access to survey land.

## Conditions under which locations may be released (and precision levels)
- General access allows identification within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class or Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under license when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references are only released in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH should perform any necessary pre-processing to avoid release; exceptional release requires strong legal demonstration of equal or higher confidentiality/IP protection.
- Spatial data within survey squares could identify square locations and is subject to the same exceptional-approval terms as six-digit references.

## Specific licensing conditions
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the period.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar but less stringent IP/confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases, and include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise locations.
- If in doubt, consult CEH.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues licenses with terms signed by authorized representatives.
- CEH provides annual public-interest reports detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; other requests are dealt with case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy to help define requirements and appropriate use; involvement may be collaborative or paid.
