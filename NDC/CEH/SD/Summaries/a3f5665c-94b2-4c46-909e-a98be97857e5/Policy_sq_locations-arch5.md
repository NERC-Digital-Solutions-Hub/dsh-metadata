# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview and scope
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data remains publicly accessible.
- CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Locations are kept confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- This protects the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future access permissions from landowners.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release allowances and precision levels
- Public-use: approximate locations can be identified within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) using four-digit grid references.
- More precise use: six-digit grid references may be released under license in exceptional cases, after CEH processes the data externally to avoid releasing precise locations.
- Very exceptional access: six-digit location data may be released externally under license if the requester demonstrates legally that their data/processes carry equal or higher confidentiality than CS data; spatial data within squares carry equivalent safeguards.
- Maps of habitats or features within squares could potentially reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional release terms.

## Licensing terms and data handling
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need for the project.
- Licences are time-bound for specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at project end.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could reveal square locations.
- Data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance; prohibits attempts to identify exact locations from the data.
- If requested, licensees may need evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP restrictions than six-digit releases but still require confidentiality protections and similar licensing terms.

## Roles, governance, and oversight
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licenses with appropriate clauses.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners summarizing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH will, subject to moderate demand, support internal pre-processing analyses; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH may provide support as part of collaboration or for a fee.

## Practical guidance for data stewards
- Treat CS location data as sensitive; ensure licensing terms are followed and durations are respected.
- Maintain records of all access requests, decisions, and destruction confirmations.
- Coordinate with CEH early in the process to define requirements and ensure compliant use of data.
- For internal use, ensure timely pre-processing analyses to avoid unnecessary releases.
