# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year series tied to the ITE Land Classification.
  - Emphasises understanding how the sampling framework derives national and country-level habitat/change estimates and how it has evolved to meet policy and reporting needs.

- Core concept: stratified sampling using the ITE Land Classification
  - Stratification carves GB into discrete land classes with similar environmental characteristics to ensure representative sampling.
  - Random sampling within each class reduces bias and supports robust national estimates of habitats and land-use features.
  - Land Classification originated from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) and was refined through successive surveys.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework
  - 1978 (first survey)
    - 32 land classes derived from 1 km squares; central squares of a 15x15 km grid classified (1215 of 1228 squares).
    - Eight samples per class; total 256 squares field-surveyed.
  - 1984 (second GB land-use survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); used the 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (CS1990: all-squares land classification)
    - Expanded to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Added land-cover data via satellite imagery; results published 1993.
    - Large-scale reclassification caused only 62% correspondence with 1978 classes; non-mersistent changes treated as neighboring classes.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Addressed policy needs for separate England&Wales vs Scotland reporting.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata created; added 19 extra squares to ensure representation; upland habitat module added.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting needs led to further country-specific subdividing (creating 5 new Welsh sub-classes; total 45 strata).
    - 43 additional Welsh squares; English coverage adjusted (some classes with as few as 4 squares); Wales becomes more heavily sampled to support Wales-only estimates.
    - Maps and tables illustrate revised class structure and sample distribution by country.
  - Upland module
    - Additional 30 squares in upland/marginal upland classes to improve accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Data outputs, sampling design, and governance
  - Outputs include national habitat estimates and country-unit estimates (England&Wales; Scotland) derived from class means and class areas, with country-specific sampling frames.
  - Emphasis on maintaining compatibility and transparency across survey iterations; changes in classification affect national estimates.
  - Note on national estimates: choosing between latest country-specific classifications or a single original 1990 classification affects consistency; preference given to the latest framework within country units for survey consistency, while original frameworks offer cross-survey comparability.
  - Tables/figures track the number of squares, class distributions, and sampling rates by year and country, highlighting evolving representativeness and precision.

- Data quality, challenges, and considerations for data leaders
  - Representativeness: shifts in classification over time can distort stratum representation; the framework adapts by re-dividing/aggregating classes and adding squares.
  - Cross-country comparability: devolution and policy needs necessitated country-specific classifications and sampling, complicating national vs. country-level estimates.
  - Data standards and metadata: documentation of classification schemes, class subdivisions, and sampling allocations is essential for reproducibility and stakeholder trust.
  - Gaps and access: early limitations in covering all GB squares at uniform detail; subsequent refinements aimed to balance precision, coverage, and reporting requirements.

- Key takeaways for data leadership and strategy
  - Build a transparent data lineage: clearly document how land classifications were derived, revised, and applied across surveys.
  - Plan for policy-driven reporting needs: incorporate country-unit sub-division and targeted upland modules to ensure timely, credible estimates.
  - Maintain metadata-rich, adaptable data structures: support evolving classifications while preserving historic comparability where possible.
  - Prioritize representativeness and error control: use stratification, adequate sample sizes per class, and explicit sampling rates to manage statistical uncertainty.
  - Consider data collaboration and reuse: the Land Classification framework integrates environmental attributes and survey data, enabling cross-study utility and potential sharing with partner networks.
