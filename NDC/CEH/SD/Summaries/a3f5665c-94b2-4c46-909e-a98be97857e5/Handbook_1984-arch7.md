# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Overview
  - 1984 field handbook for the Ecological Survey of Great Britain (Project 424) to establish a quality baseline for land use and habitats.
  - Land Classes derived from a multivariate classification of 1 km squares; 384 squares surveyed in 1984 (12 from each of 32 classes) to cover Great Britain.
  - Aim: enable ground survey and aerial photography comparisons, support landscape objectives, and provide data compatible with previous surveys.

- Survey design and scope
  - Grid-based sampling: 1:10,000 maps used; 6" map annotations for each square.
  - Sampling framework: 7 groups of squares surveyed by teams from six ITE research stations; roving liaison with Merlewood.
  - Unit size and mapping: minimum mappable area ~0.5 hectare; square-level data captured with structured categories and codes.
  - Planning considerations: minimize revisits due to travel costs; multiple planning options (daily travel, overnight stays, or longer group arrangements).

- Field work and equipment
  - Equipment: FAB field recording booklets, 6" maps, film, coluored pens, navigation gear, ITE ID, clipboard, pencils, weather gear, reference books, camera.
  - Field procedure: arrive, assess access and problems, obtain permissions for the entire square, plan a route to cover the square, complete recording, and review records for omissions.
  - Permissions: secure access to all parts of the square to avoid wasted work; maintain goodwill with farmers/landowners; carry identity and use an ownership list to update contacts.

- Data recording and FAB (Field Assessment Booklet)
  - Mapping approach: annotate 6" (1:10,000) maps with coded data; use combinations of numeric codes within map boxes to represent complex vegetative and landscape features.
  - Coding structure: codes linked to an alpha/number system; linear and adjacency relationships recorded directly on the map; decisions in the field are final, with qualifying notes allowed.
  - FAB structure: each square’s data compiled into a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) with pages for:
    - Cover and series/location details
    - Ownership and tenant information
    - Farmer/Landowner information
    - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal
    - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation
    - Forestry/Woodland/Trees
    - Boundaries
    - Recreation
    - Buildings/Structures/Communications
    - Photography instructions and page references
    - Post-survey procedure notes

- Data sheets by theme (key categories and guidance)
  - Ownership
    - Record ownership of all land units within the square; mark units by owner number (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
    - Use “T” for tenant farmers and “C” for owners who changed since 1977/78.
    - Rate owner/person cooperation on a 0–3 scale to gauge willingness to assist future surveys.
  - Farmer / Landowner Information
    - Not an official questionnaire; gather background conversation data if possible.
    - Engage at least one farmer per square, ideally the primary landholder; summarize conversations if needed.
  - Physiography / Inland Water / Coastal
    - Detailed coded categories for cliffs, rock outcrops, peat, erosion, dunes, shorelines, rivers, canals, ditches, springs, levees, etc.
    - Distinctions for inland vs. coastal features; definitions for ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, and drainage signs.
  - Agriculture / Natural Vegetation
    - Cover types (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, crops, fallow, abandoned land, etc.).
    - Species-level notes for major ground cover when >25% cover; growth forms, uses (e.g., grazing, recreation), and stock types.
    - Measurements and height classes where applicable; crop specifics (barley, wheat, oats, etc.); notes on management practices (burnt moor, silage, etc.).
  - Forestry / Woodland / Trees
    - Record tree and woodland units, including cover types, density, age, regeneration, planting, belts, hedgerows, and individual trees.
    - Distinguish coppice, scrub, belts, lines, and hedges; use codes for age, proportions, and tree species.
    - Describe features such as shelter, recreation, amenity value, unmanaged areas, natural regeneration, and underplanting.
  - Boundaries
    - Document boundary types (e.g., mortared/dry-stone walls, stockproof fences), descriptions, and gaps filled to stockproof boundaries.
    - Record boundary length and associated descriptors; indicate boundaries relevant to curtilages.
  - Recreation
    - Capture formal and informal recreational uses (parks, golf courses, tennis courts, playing fields, moorland recreation, nature trails, etc.).
  - Buildings / Structures / Communications
    - Map built cover types and classify buildings by use (residential, industrial, commercial, public services, educational/cultural, religious, institutional).
    - Record new developments, derelict sites, vacant land, roads, tracks (constructed/unconstructed), footpaths, bridges, tunnels, barriers, and signage.
    - Use color coding to simplify map interpretation when possible.
  - Color conventions for coding
    - Suggested color coding: residential (yellow), agricultural curtilage (green variations), urban/curtilage with trees (green-dots), new development (orange), public/open space (purple/blue), roads (red), etc.
  - Photography
    - Take five photographs per square with viewpoints that best reflect the square; record exact locations and directions on the FAB front/back map pages.

- Post-survey procedures
  - Review data at the end of the survey day to check for omissions; avoid transposing to new maps unless necessary to prevent damage.
  - Communicate batch completion to Merlewood; arrange transportation of completed FABs as batches become available.

- Data management, compatibility, and aims
  - Data items chosen to meet landscape objectives and align with historical surveys; aim for compatibility with previous surveys (e.g., 1977/78) to enable change detection via ground surveys and aerial photography.
  - The approach emphasizes explicit field decision-making, thorough documentation, and structured coding to support GIS-based data integration and map-based visualization.

- End notes
  - The handbook provides a comprehensive, field-ready protocol for capturing landscape, vegetation, land-use, and infrastructure data across Great Britain, enabling consistent GIS-ready data products for policy, planning, and public-access visualization.
