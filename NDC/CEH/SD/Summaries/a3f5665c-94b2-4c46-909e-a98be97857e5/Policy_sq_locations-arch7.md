# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise the public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality protects scientific sampling integrity, environmental protections, and future landowner permission for surveys.
- Release requests are managed by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid square) may be released under licence to indicate which grid squares contain CS survey squares.
- Six-digit grid references (more precise locations) are only released in very exceptional circumstances, with CEH performing pre-processing analysis to avoid release when possible.
- Spatial data from within survey squares could identify square locations and is subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.
- If precise locations are essential, applicants must demonstrate that their data/IP protection levels are equal to or higher than CS data.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
- A clause prevents licensees from using data to identify exact square locations or to claim such capability.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorised personnel for the project.
- Licences are finite in period and data must be destroyed at the end; no retention for other organisational duties.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
- Potential licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP when required.
- Four-digit releases share similar licensing terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality for the intended use.
- License terms prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decision-making under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to CS location data usage; CEH may participate or provide guidance in a collaborative or paid capacity.

## Practical guidance for GIS specialists
- Plan data access early: consult CEH to understand licensing, IP requirements, and pre-processing options.
- Prefer four-digit (10x10 km) references when possible to balance utility and confidentiality.
- If precise locations are essential, prepare to demonstrate high IP/confidentiality protections and engage CEH in pre-processing.
- Ensure data storage and access are secure, with restricted, need-to-know access for licensed personnel only.
- Do not use location data to plan land visits, verify landowner compliance, or identify exact square locations.
- Consider requesting CEH assistance for data preparation to minimize the need for releasing precise coordinates.
