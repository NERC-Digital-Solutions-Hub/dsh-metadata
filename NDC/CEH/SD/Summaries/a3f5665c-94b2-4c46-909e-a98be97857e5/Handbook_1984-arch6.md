# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- A practical field data collection guide for a national ecological survey of Great Britain, built around a grid of land classes and 1x1 km squares, with 1984 field work expanding on earlier 1976–78 activities.
- Purpose: establish a quality baseline for land cover, land use and habitat data to enable comparisons with aerial photography and future monitoring.
- Outputs: coded map annotations and Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) to enable consistent recording and later data use, analysis, and potential sharing/advancement of data products.

## Key aims and context for data support

- Standardized, repeatable data collection to enable cross-square comparison and historical monitoring.
- Data items cover ownership, physical geography, vegetation/land cover, forestry, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications, and photography.
- Emphasis on self-serve data products (maps, codes, summaries) and feedback to improve outputs and data creation practices.

## Sampling design and scope

- Origin: Land Classes were created from multivariate classification of 1 km squares; 256 squares were surveyed in 1977–78 (8 per class); 384 squares (12 per class) were surveyed in 1984 across Great Britain.
- Objective: assess changes in habitats and land use by ground survey and compare with aerial photography (ITE 899).
- Plan: seven groups of survey teams from six ITE research stations; each square assigned to a team; aims to increase statistical confidence and enable partial replacement sampling in future.

## Planning and logistics

- Each square is planned for a finite survey effort; careful travel planning is emphasized to minimize duplicate visits and overtime costs.
- Three planning approaches:
  - Travel from stations for 1 square daily.
  - One night away for 2 squares (on the way out and back).
  - Two-weekly or weekly group survey for multiple squares.
- Teams manage access, permissions, and route planning to cover full square efficiently.

## Equipment

- Two categories of equipment:
  - Equipment provided to teams (FABs, maps, films, field handouts, coloured pens, navigation tools, identity cards, clipboards, pencils, weather gear, reference books, camera).
  - General field gear (as needed for recording and field safety).
- Focus on mapping and recording rather than precise measurement.

## Field procedures and permissions

- On arrival: assess access, potential problems, and area familiarity.
- Obtain permissions for whole square before surveying; ensure goodwill of landowners/farmers; permission is essential to avoid wasted work.
- Prior contact can help, but may cause delays; surveyors carry identity and project information.
- Ownership data collection: record ownership and tenant status; mark owners by unit numbers; rate owner/cooperation on a scale (0–3) to guide future engagement.

## Data recording framework (FAB) and coding system

- Survey data are mapped onto 6" (1:10,000) maps using a defined coding system; a sequence of numeric codes can be combined and represented by single alphanumeric entries.
- Field decisions are made in the field; the recorder must document uncertainties or atypical situations with qualifying notes in the FAB.
- Aims to keep data relatively compact while preserving rich contextual information through code combinations and notes.

## Field data sheets (FAB) and content

- FAB is a Field Assessment Booklet consisting of page sections that must be completed for each square:
  - Cover: completes essential identifiers (series number, location, etc.).
  - Ownership: mark ownership of land units within the square; indicate tenant vs owner; owner cooperation ratings.
  - Farmer/Landowner Information: conversational notes to provide background context; interview at least one principal landholder per square.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: codes for cliffs, rock features, peat, erosion, streams, ponds, rivers, ditches, springs, levees, and related coastal/inland physiography features.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, etc.: broad ground cover categories (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland heaths, marshes, aquatic vegetation, crops, fallow/abandoned land, species lists when cover is substantial, and animal/husbandry uses where relevant).
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: woodland and tree features, cover types, age classes, proportions, species lists, management status (unmanaged, plantation, regeneration), hedgerows, belts, scrub, coppice, and individual tree coding; notes on underplanting, natural regeneration, and re-growth after cutting.
  - Boundaries: boundary types (e.g., walls, fences, hedges, stockproof boundaries); descriptions to supplement codes; notes on gaps and boundary conditions.
  - Recreation: formal and informal recreation areas, play fields, golf courses, race tracks, educational/recreational sites, and other public access features.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, descriptions, and relationships to curtilages; roads, tracks, footpaths (exclusive and shared), barriers, signage, embankments, bridges, tunnels, pylons, and other infrastructure.
  - Photography: five photographs per square, with precise location and direction notes for each image.
  - Procedure Subsequence: post-survey checks, data integrity, and guidance on data handling; advice against unnecessary transposition of data to new maps; coordination with Merlewood (data submission and transport of FABs).
- Colour conventions are encouraged to reduce map clutter (e.g., yellow for residential buildings, green for agricultural curtilage with trees, orange for commercial buildings, etc.), and specific color schemes are provided for particular categories.

## Data coding and usage details

- Codes are applied to specific features (e.g., boundary types, vegetation types, crops, livestock types, woodland structures, and infrastructure).
- Examples include detailed vegetation and species lists (cover types and accompanying species codes), management descriptors (amenity, recreation, shelter, etc.), and proportion-based qualifiers (e.g., 25–50% of canopy cover).
- Field operators must indicate proportions, ages, and growth stages where relevant (e.g., age classes for trees; height classes for bracken and heather).
- Boundary and boundary-description coding supports complex boundary configurations (e.g., stockproof, filled gaps, derelict boundaries).
- The FAB pages include explicit instructions for how to handle complex mosaics, how to record partial or mixed cover, and how to retain map readability.

## Post-survey procedures and data management

- After surveying, sheets should be checked to ensure no feature is omitted.
- Transposing data to new maps is discouraged; maintain original maps where feasible.
- Batch submission of completed FABs to Merlewood should follow a timely schedule.
- Documentation and updates to ownership lists (from the previous survey) should be maintained.

## Photography and documentation

- Photographs are an integral, structured part of data capture; precise geo-locations and viewing directions are recorded to support later interpretation and cross-referencing with FAB data.

## Practical considerations for data use and data products

- The framework supports the creation of standardized, map-based data products that reflect land cover, land use, habitat features, and ownership/landholding context.
- The data are designed to be re-usable across time (with aerial comparison) and across regions, enabling landscape trend analyses and policy-focused insights.
- Early prototype outputs can be refined with user feedback to improve data usability and sharing within and beyond the survey teams.
