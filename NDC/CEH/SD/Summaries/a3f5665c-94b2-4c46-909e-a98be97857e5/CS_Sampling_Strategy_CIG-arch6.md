# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Document describes the evolution of the sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification used to underpin Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
  - Emphasises that the current methodology is built on decades of development and is tightly linked to earlier time-series data for detecting change.

- Core concepts guiding the approach
  - Stratified (carved-up) sampling to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage of ecological variation across Great Britain.
  - ITE Land Classification: an environmental stratification system derived from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to group land into discrete classes for sampling.
  - Use of 1 km square sampling units, with initial focus on center squares within a 15x15 km grid; early classification led to 32–40 land classes over time.
  - Necessity of random or objective selection within strata to obtain typical, unbiased samples.

- Development timeline and key milestones
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
    - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used on environmental data from 1228 central 1 km squares to define 32 land classes.
    - Final sample: 256 squares (8 per class) surveyed nationally; habitat area estimates derived by class proportions.
  - 1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (total 384 squares) using the 1978 Land Classification as the basis.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every GB 1 km square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Repeated recording of vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping; introduction of Land Cover Map linkage.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification & Fourth Field Survey)
    - Classification expanded to enable separate Scottish reporting; total classes increased to 40.
    - 569 squares surveyed; national estimates re-based on the updated classification.
  - 2007 (Revised Land Classification & Fifth Field Survey)
    - Welsh-only reporting needs prompted new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and 45 strata total.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares; England adjustments compensated for reduced Welsh sampling.
    - 591 squares surveyed; improved representation across Wales and England; Scotland continued under separate framework.

- Detailed sampling and class structure changes
  - 1978: 32 ITE Land Classes; 8 squares per class; 256 total.
  - 1984: 32 classes retained; 12 squares per class; 384 total; enlargement to improve national estimates.
  - 1990: All GB squares classified; major integration of climate/geology proxies; 508 squares surveyed; base classification adjusted for regional reporting.
  - 1998: Land Classes increased to 40 to support Scotland reporting; sample expansion to address regional policy needs.
  - 2007: Wales-specific sub-classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total 45 strata; Wales extra squares to ensure six squares per Welsh class; England adjustments to maintain precision.

- Country-specific reporting and uplands module
  - CS2000 introduced country-unit reporting (England with Wales, and Scotland) using country-specific class subdivisions and aggregations to ensure adequate representation per country.
  - An uplands module added 30 squares in upland/marginal upland areas of England and Wales to improve habitat estimates in those zones.

- National estimates and consistency considerations
  - Changing land classifications affects cross-survey comparability; 2006 scoping noted the trade-off between latest classification and cross-survey consistency.
  - National estimates can be produced using the original 1990 classification or the latest classification; the preferred approach depends on whether consistency within a survey or comparability across surveys is prioritized.
  - Tables and figures illustrate the distribution of squares by class and country over time.

- Outputs and reference points
  - Main survey reports published at key milestones:
    - CS1990 main report (1993)
    - CS2000 results for England & Wales (2008)
  - Documentation includes detailed tables of square counts, strata areas, and sampling rates across surveys and countries.
  - Further reading and acknowledgments provide context and methodological grounding for the Land Classification and sampling evolution.

- Practical implications for data support
  - The sampling framework provides a defensible, stratified approach to capturing GB-wide ecological variation, enabling robust national and country-specific habitat estimates.
  - The ongoing evolution of land classifications requires careful alignment when comparing across surveys; explicit notes are provided to guide consistent interpretation of results.
