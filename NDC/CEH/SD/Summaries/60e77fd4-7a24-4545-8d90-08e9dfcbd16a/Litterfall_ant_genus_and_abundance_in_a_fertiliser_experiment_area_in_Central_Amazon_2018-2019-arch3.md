# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

## Study area
- Conducted within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) area, KM41 reserve, ~100 km from Manaus, Brazil.
- Humid/wet climate: mean temperature ~26.7°C; ~2400 mm annual precipitation; dry season July–September; peak rainfall March–April.
- Vegetation: dense Terra Firme rainforest.
- Soils: clayey red-yellow pods and yellow latosols (geric ferrasols) with high weathering, acidity, and low nutrient fertility.

## AFEX experimental design
- Full factorial fertilization experiment with seven treatments plus a control (total of 8 treatments).
- 4 replicates per treatment, totaling 32 plots.
- Plots arranged in four independent blocks at least 250 m apart.
- Plot size: 50 × 50 m; plots ≥100 m apart.
- Treatments (as named in data): Control; nitrogen (N); phosphorus (P); cations (CAT); nitrogen + phosphorus (N+P); cat+n; cat+p; cat+n+p.
- Fertilization: annual applications, split into three applications to mitigate nutrient loss via leaching/runoff.
- Nutrients provided as follows: N (125 kg N ha−1 year−1) as urea; P (50 kg P ha−1 year−1) as triple superphosphate; K (50 kg K ha−1 year−1) as KCl; Ca (160 kg Ca ha−1 year−1) and Mg (160 kg Mg ha−1 year−1) as dolomitic limestone.

## Ant sampling and taxonomy
- Within each 50 × 50 m plot, five 1 × 1 m sub-plots were sampled (20 sub-plots per treatment; 160 total).
- Ant collection method: Winkler extractor; litter collected, placed in Winkler sacks; 48-hour extraction; ants preserved in 90% ethanol.
- Sampling years: 2018 (October) and 2019 (September) during the dry season.
- Taxonomy: identification by subfamilies and genera using Baccaro et al. (2015); species-level IDs aided by AntCat (Bolton, 2020) and INPA collections for verification.
- Data captured: richness, composition, relative abundance, and frequency of ant species in litter samples.

## Data and metadata

- Data spreadsheet: litterfall_ants.csv with fields including YEAR, BLOCK, PLOT, TRT, SUBFAMILIES, GENERA, INDIVIDUAL.
- Example structure: rows detailing year, block, plot, treatment, ant subfamily, genus, and individual counts (reflecting sampling across treatments and years).
- Data deposition: data deposited into the Environmental Information Data Center (EIDC).

## Data governance, sharing, and collaboration

- Uses established taxonomic references and online catalogs (AntCat) and cross-references with INPA collections for species-level verification.
- Data sharing through EIDC supports openness and reusability, aligning with broader data governance practices in environmental monitoring.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks

- Provides a transparent, replicable framework for evaluating nutrient addition impacts on invertebrate (ant) communities in tropical forests.
- Demonstrates a robust experimental design (full factorial, replicated blocks, standardized plot layout) suitable for informing policy decisions about nutrient management and forest health monitoring.
- Showcases end-to-end data handling: standardized collection protocols, taxonomic standardization, clear data structure, and public data sharing with metadata considerations.
- Addresses common monitoring challenges (data gaps, access, metadata quality, data transformation, and communicating complex biodiversity results) by emphasizing open data deposition, metadata, and clear reporting streams.
