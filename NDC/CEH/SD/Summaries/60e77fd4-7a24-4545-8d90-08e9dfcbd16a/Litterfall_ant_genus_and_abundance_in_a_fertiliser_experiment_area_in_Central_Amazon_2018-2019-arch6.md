Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

- Study area and climate
  - Conducted inside the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) area, KM41 reserve, ~100 km from Manaus, Brazil.
  - Humid, wet climate; mean temperature ~26.7°C; annual precipitation ~2400 mm; dry season July–Sept; peak rains March–April.
  - Vegetation: dense Terra Firme rainforest; soils are clayey red-yellow pods and yellow latosols with high weathering, acidity, and low fertility (geric ferrasols).

- AFEX experimental design
  - Full factorial fertilization with seven treatments plus control, replicated four times (total 32 plots).
  - Treatments: N (125 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as urea), P (50 kg P ha-1 yr-1 as triple superphosphate), and cations (K 50 kg K ha-1 yr-1 as KCl; Ca 160 kg Ca ha-1 yr-1; Mg 160 kg Mg ha-1 yr-1 as dolomitic limestone).
  - Plot layout: each plot 50 x 50 m, with at least 100 m between plots; four independent blocks.
  - AFEX 2.0: three annual fertilizer applications to mitigate leaching/runoff; fertilizers spread by hand during systemic walks.

- Ant sampling design and methods
  - Within each 50 x 50 m plot, five 1 x 1 m sub-plots sampled, totaling 20 sub-plots per treatment and 160 across all treatments.
  - Ants collected with Winkler extractors; litter samples placed for 48 hours, preserved in 90% ethanol.
  - Sampling years: 2018 (October) and 2019 (September) during the dry season.
  - Taxonomic work: preliminary identification by subfamily and genus using published keys; species-level IDs cross-checked with AntCat; specimens compared with INPA collections when needed.
  - Outputs include measures of richness, composition, relative abundance, and frequency by subfamily, genus, and species.

- Data spreadsheet and structure
  - File: litterfall_ants.csv (deposited in EIDC).
  - Key columns: YEAR (2018 or 2019; sampling October 2018 and September 2019), BLOCK (1–4), PLOT (1–5), TRT (treatment or combination as named in AFEX), SUBFAMILIES, GENERA, INDIVIDUAL (count per taxon per sub-plot).
  - Data describe the number of ants by subfamily and genus, across plots and treatments.

- Data product usage and availability
  - Dataset enables analyses of ant community responses to fertilization treatments, including richness, taxonomic composition, and abundance patterns.
  - Data are prepared to be explored in self-serve dashboards or reports, with guidance on interpretation and potential for further development.
  - Outputs supported by multiple data sources: taxonomic keys (Baccaro et al. 2015), AntCat (Bolton 2020), and INPA collections for verification.

- References and context
  - Includes literature on soil and forest relationships, taxonomic guides, and the broader BDFFP context and methods.
