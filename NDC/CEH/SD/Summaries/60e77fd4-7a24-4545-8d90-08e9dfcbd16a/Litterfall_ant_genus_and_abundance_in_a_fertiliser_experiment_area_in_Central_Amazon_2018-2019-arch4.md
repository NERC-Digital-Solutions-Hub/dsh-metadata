# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

## Study area
- Conducted within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) area, KM41 reserve, ~100 km from Manaus, Brazil (02°24'S, 59°52'W).
- Climate: humid/wet, mean temperature ~26.7°C, annual precipitation ~2400 mm; dry season July–September; rain peak March–April.
- Vegetation: dense Terra Firme rainforest.
- Soils: clayey red-yellow podzols and yellow latosols; highly weathered, acidic, low nutrient fertility (WRB: ferrasols).

## AFEX experimental design
- Start: March 2017; full factorial fertilization experiment.
- Treatments: seven treatments plus control, in total 8 treatments.
- Replication: four replicates per treatment; 32 plots total.
- Layout: four independent blocks, each at least 250 m apart.
- Nutrients applied: N (125 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ as urea); P (50 kg P ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ as triple superphosphate); cations K (50 kg K ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ as KCl), Ca (160 kg Ca ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ as dolomitic limestone), Mg (160 kg Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ as dolomitic limestone).
- Treatment combinations: Control; N; P; CAT (cations); N+P; cat+n; cat+p; cat+n+p.
- Plot size and spacing: each plot 50 × 50 m, with a minimum of 100 m between plots.
- Fertilization protocol: annual, delivered in three applications to mitigate nutrient leaching and runoff; applied manually along a systematic walk within plots.

## Ant sampling and data collection
- Subplots: five 1 × 1 m sub-plots per 50 × 50 m plot (total 20 sub-plots per treatment; 160 sub-plots overall).
- Sampling method: Winkler extractor to assess litter-dwelling ants.
- Sample processing: litter placed in Winkler sacks, then extracted for 48 hours; ants fixed in 90% alcohol.
- Sampling years: 2018 (October) and 2019 (September) – two dry-season samplings.
- Taxonomic approach: subfamily and genus keys (Baccaro et al. 2015); species-level identifications cross-checked with AntCat; reference specimens held at INPA.
- Data produced: community metrics including richness, composition, relative abundance, and frequency for ant species.

## Data spreadsheet and data management
- Data file: litterfall_ants.csv.
- Key columns: YEAR, BLOCK, PLOT, TRT (treatment), SUBFAMILIES, GENERA, INDIVIDUAL.
- Data structure: rows represent ant records per sub-plot per sampling event; example values show multiple entries per year, block, plot, and treatment, with subfamily and genus identifications and counts.
- Data deposition and provenance: data deposited into EIDC (electronic data/information repository); identifications based on taxonomic keys; supporting specimens stored at INPA.
- Sampling scale: 32 plots × 5 sub-plots per plot = 160 sub-plots; 2 sampling events (2018, 2019) across blocks and treatments.

## Data quality, standards and challenges (for Data Leaders)
- Standardized sampling method (Winkler extraction) and consistent annual timing.
- Taxonomic identifications rely on published keys and online catalogs (AntCat); potential species-level ambiguities addressed via reference collections (INPA).
- Metadata included (year, block, plot, treatment) facilitating cross-study comparability and reproducibility.
- Data accessibility: deposited in EIDC; need to consider discoverability and interoperability with other data systems.
- Data gaps and future use: experimental design supports analysis of fertilization effects on litter-dwelling ant communities; dataset enables analysis across treatments, spatial blocks, and temporal replicates.
