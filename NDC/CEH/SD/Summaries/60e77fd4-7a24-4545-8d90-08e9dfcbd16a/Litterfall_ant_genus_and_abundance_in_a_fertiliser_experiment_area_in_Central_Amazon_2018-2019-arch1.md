# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

## Study area and environmental context
- Located in the KM41 reserve within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), ~100 km from Manaus, Brazil.
- Tropical humid climate: mean temperature ~26.7°C; annual precipitation ~2400 mm; dry season July–September; rain peak March–April.
- Vegetation: dense Terra Firme rainforest.
- Soils: red-yellow podzols and yellow latosols; highly weathered, acidic, low fertility; WRB class ferrasols.

## Experimental design (AFEX)
- Full factorial fertilization with seven treatments plus a control, total 32 plots arranged in four blocks (at least 250 m apart).
- Treatments (N, P, and cations): N (125 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as urea); P (50 kg P ha-1 yr-1 as triple superphosphate); cations (K 50 kg K ha-1 yr-1 as KCl; Ca 160 kg Ca ha-1 yr-1; Mg 160 kg Mg ha-1 yr-1 as dolomitic limestone).
- Treatment combinations: Control; N; P; CAT (cations); N+P; CAT+N; CAT+P; N+P+CAT (8 total treatments).
- Plot size: 50 x 50 m; all plots ≥100 m apart; similar soil, vegetation, and topography across plots.
- Fertilization cadence: annual, split into three applications to mitigate leaching and runoff; fertilizers applied by hand during a systemic walk.

## Ant sampling methodology
- Within each 50 x 50 m plot, five 1 x 1 m sub-plots used for ant sampling (total of 20 sub-plots per treatment; 160 samples overall).
- Collection method: Winkler extractor; litter placed in 1 m² samples; extraction over 48 hours; ants preserved in 90% ethanol.
- Data available from two annual samplings: October 2018 and September 2019 (dry season).
- Taxonomic identification: ants grouped by subfamilies and genera using standard keys; species-level comparisons with AntCat catalog and INPA collection specimens.
- Sampling layout and sub-plot distribution visualized in figures.

## Data spreadsheet and structure
- File: litterfall_ants.csv (data described as Figure 4 in the document).
- Key columns:
  - YEAR: sampling year (2018 or 2019, corresponding to Oct 2018 and Sep 2019)
  - BLOCK: block (1–4)
  - PLOT: plot (1–5)
  - TRT: treatment (as listed in AFEX design)
  - SUBFAMILIES: ant subfamily
  - GENERA: ant genus
  - INDIVIDUAL: number of individuals
- Example entries show diverse subfamilies (e.g., Myrmicinae, Ponerinae) and genera (e.g., Crematogaster, Nylanderia, Hypoponera, Gnamptogenys).
- Data description includes how counts are organized per year, plot, and treatment.
- Data deposited in the Environmental Information and Data Center (EIDC) for discoverability and reuse.

## Analysis potential and data considerations
- Analyses enabled:
  - Assess effects of N, P, and cation additions, individually and in combinations, on ant richness (subfamilies/genera) and abundance.
  - Examine treatment-by-year (temporal) changes in community composition and species turnover.
  - Explore block effects and spatial variation within the KM41 reserve.
  - Compare functional or taxonomic groups (e.g., dominant genera) across fertilization regimes.
- Data quality and scope considerations:
  - Local-scale, plot- and block-level design; two time points limit long-term trend inferences.
  - Taxonomic resolution limited to subfamilies and genera (species-level identifications supported but not guaranteed for all entries).
  - Data integration with other AFEX datasets possible to enhance ecological inferences.
  - Accessibility is improved via deposition in EIDC with metadata for discoverability.
