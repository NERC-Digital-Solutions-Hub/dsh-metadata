# Countryside Survey 1978

## Aim and scope
- Establish a consistent, time-series ecological assessment of environments using standardized data formats.
- Enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Encourage data to be usable beyond single outputs by combining with other datasets and by ensuring underlying data are accessible.

## Who this handbook targets
- Field survey teams conducting environmental monitoring with predefined responsibilities.
- Analysts who apply topic expertise and standardized methods to produce comparable outputs (e.g., vegetation, habitat, soils, boundaries).

## Core methodology and principles
- Data collection follows established sources and quality assurance practices: verify, clean, transform, and store data appropriately.
- The approach emphasizes standardisation, reproducibility, and clear presentation (reports, maps, charts).
- Deviations from the basic method are allowed for real-world circumstances but must be documented.

## Survey design and objectives
- The objective is an ecological assessment of a 2-kilometre square sampling unit, as consistent as possible across squares.
- Sampling program within each square:
  - Five randomly located 200 m vegetation plots.
  - Five randomly located soil pits at the centers of vegetation plots.
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information captured for the entire square.
- The handbook provides keys and lists (e.g., cow/sheep information) to standardise data collection.

## Permissions and logistics
- Obtain landowner permissions before starting; aim for minimal disturbance and short visit duration.
- Record owner details and any land-use notes (e.g., what fields will be sampled for soil pits).
- Mention of using permitted fields and the need to note ownership on data sheets.

## Plot setup and location
- The main vegetation plot is 200 m and defined by five posts forming a square with diagonal strings; centre is found by a near-universal navigation method (maps, compass, and pacing).
- Plot centres are positioned to avoid linear features; if a plot falls near a feature, relocate and re-map accordingly.
- Five plots per square are marked on maps; alterations to these plots must be carefully recorded.
- Species data collection proceeds from the inner quadrat outward, noting only additional species at each step.
- In crop areas, plot completion follows edge species from hedgerows or tracks; accuracy may be limited but remains the chosen method.

## Data collection at plots
- Vegetation: record all vascular plants; restricted bryophyte and lichen lists; handle identification problems by collecting samples.
- Cover estimates: within 5% categories; avoid over- or under-estimation; target dominant species.
- Plot attribute data: slope and aspect measurements; habitat attributes recorded with notes for ambiguous categories.
- Plot description and habitat categories are detailed (e.g., woodland types, moorland, grassland, arable, hedges, boundaries, ground features, aquatic/marine habitats, and various livestock/domestic animal considerations).

## Soil pit procedures
- Soil pit located at the centre of the appropriate quadrat quadrant; adjustments if obstructions occur.
- Pit dimensions typically 45–60 cm wide and ~1 m long; dug to a horizon depth (C, Cr, or R) or 75 cm, whichever comes first.
- Horizons identified and boundaries marked; horizons described with standard data sheet fields (moisture, colour, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, soil group, parent material, etc.).
- Sampling from horizons involves collecting small samples from the surface horizon and underlying horizons as needed.
- Soil horizon data are recorded with horizon numbers, thickness, symbols, moisture status, colour, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, and other horizon features.

## Linear features and sampling
- Linear plots are not placed on the map; field-recorded positioning based on observations.
- Linear plots (10 m x 1 m) along hedges, streams, and roads are completed in direct relation to the feature.
- Species identification follows the same rules as the large quadrats; principal species are captured, with woody species within hedges documented.

## Data sheets, coding, and sketch maps
- Data sheets contain standardized fields for vegetation, soil horizons, and habitat attributes; horizon symbol, colour, structure, texture, moisture, etc., have defined codes.
- Sketch maps record crops, hedgerows, field boundaries, and habitat types; additional notes help depict the square accurately for interpretation.
- Back-of-book resources include the Land Classes framework and modifications.

## Boundaries, hedges, and boundaries-related features
- Boundaries and boundary features (walls, fences, hedges, posts, barbed wire) are categorized with detailed codes to reflect condition, construction, and management status.
- Hedges and hedgerows are documented for composition, age, structure, management, and notable features (e.g., gaps, removal, or restoration).

## Crops, agriculture, and buildings
- Document crops (arable, pasture, meadow, root crops, horticulture, etc.) and associated features (drainage, rubbish, farm buildings, enclosures, orchard, recreation areas).
- Buildings (vernacular vs non-vernacular, domestic, industrial) are classified by style, material, and function (e.g., farms, cottages, sheds, warehouses).

## Habitat and landscape typology
- Habitats and vegetation categories are used to describe dominant vegetation communities and landscape components, with emphasis on dominant species and larger patches.
- Special sections cover aquatic and marine habitats, rock and cliff habitats, and animal presence (livestock, game birds, wild mammals, birds) with guidance on evidence (droppings, tracks, direct sightings).

## Domestic animals, wildlife, and breeds
- A comprehensive framework for recording common domestic animals on the premises (e.g., sheep breeds and cattle) and associated breed sheets; practice includes field-led breed identification with photoguides if available.

## Data quality, review, and completion
- After fieldwork, verify that all sheets are completed, ensure data cleanliness, and cross-check against the kilometre-square map.
- A final check ensures nothing important is left out and the square’s representation is as complete as possible.

## Appendix highlights
- Horizon symbols, colour and texture coding schemes.
- Species and aggregates coding lists for botanicals and bryophytes.
- Guidelines for identifying key bryophytes and lichens.
- Land Class descriptions and regional variations to aid classification across different landscapes.

## Concluding note
- The handbook emphasizes a balanced approach to data collection, prioritizing completeness and interpretability while adapting to diverse field conditions.
- It provides a comprehensive framework for standardized countryside monitoring, enabling long-term ecological assessment and cross-square comparability.
