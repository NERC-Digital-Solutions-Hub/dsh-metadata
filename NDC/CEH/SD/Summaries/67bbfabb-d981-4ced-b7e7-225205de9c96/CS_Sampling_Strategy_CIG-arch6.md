# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview and purpose
- Presents the evolution of the Countryside Survey sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification over 30 years.
- Aims to provide robust, time-series habitat estimates for Great Britain by stratifying samples using an environmental land classification.

## Core concepts: stratification and data foundation
- Stratified, objective sample selection is used to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage of land types.
- The ITE Land Classification groups land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to guide sampling and enable regional or national estimates.
- Time-series value depends on consistency and linkage to previous classifications while accommodating policy-relevant country reporting.

## Timeline and key developments in land classification and sampling

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1228 squares classified).
  - Surrounding four squares per centre were also allocated to classes.
  - 256 samples (8 per class) surveyed across GB.
  - National habitat area estimates based on mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by land-class area.

- 1984 (Second field survey)
  - Sampling expanded to 12 km squares per land class (384 total); used the 1978 Land Classification for estimates.
  - Results reported in Landscape Changes in Britain.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify all 1 km squares in GB; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats plus added features.
  - National estimates now aligned with the 1990 Land Classification; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; fourth field survey)
  - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to enable Scotland reporting.
  - 569 squares surveyed; CS1990 outputs reinterpreted with the new framework.

- 2000 (Countryside Survey CS2000)
  - Need to produce separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) led to new country-unit reporting.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; class aggregation applied where necessary.
  - 40 strata expanded to 45; 19 additional squares added for Wales representation; 11 extra squares allocated to balance England and Wales sampling.
  - A dedicated uplands module added to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.

- 2007 (Countryside Survey CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements driven devolution and policy needs.
  - Wales sub-divided into five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - 43 additional Welsh squares surveyed; some English classes in Wales retained with fewer squares (4) but considered adequate for reporting.
  - England/Scotland adjustments maintained for country reporting.
  - A Wales-focused sampling map and revised country-unit framework implemented.
  - The uplands module continued to enhance estimates (additional 30 upland squares).

## Sampling design specifics
- Use of 1 km squares as the primary sampling unit; centre squares of a grid plus surrounding squares to capture local variability.
- National estimates constructed by combining per-square habitat measures with the corresponding land-class areas.
- Population of squares per class and per country adjusted across survey cycles to maintain representation and enable country-specific estimates (England with Wales, Scotland; later Wales-focused refinements).

## Outputs, interpretation, and comparability
- Outputs include time-series habitat area estimates and change statistics across surveys, supported by maps and land-class classifications.
- Note: Changing the underlying land-class framework affects cross-survey comparability; within-survey consistency is prioritized by using the latest classification for that survey while acknowledging cross-survey differences.

## Country focus and uplands emphasis
- England with Wales and Scotland reporting implemented; separate country-unit estimates enhance policy relevance.
- Wales required additional Welsh-specific classes and samples to meet Wales-only reporting needs.
- Uplands module added to CS2000/CS2007 to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

## Historical references and context
- The document traces the progression from the 1978 inception through 1987–1998 development, to the CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 frameworks.
- It situates the sampling strategy within broader methodological work on the ITE Land Classification and related ecological surveys.
