# Countryside Survey 1978 Introduction

- Purpose: Define guidelines for the field survey to obtain an overall ecological assessment of each 2-kilometre square unit; flexibility is allowed for site-specific divergences, which should be recorded.
- Objective: Achieve a consistent, comparable ecological snapshot across squares, accounting for weather, landowner constraints, and terrain.

## Survey Design and Sampling Framework

- Sampling structure per square:
  - Five randomly located vegetation plots of 200 m.
  - Five randomly located soil pits, centered on the plots.
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information captured for the whole square.
- Data capture: Progressive topics covered in the Handbook, with keys and categorizations (e.g., Cow/S sheep information) centralized for accessibility.

## Permissions and Field Access

- On arrival, obtain permission and ownership details where possible before starting.
- Emphasize short visits with minimal disturbance; use handouts only for definite official requirements.
- Record ownership information on the data sheets; note fields or boundaries used for soil pits as needed.

## Plot Location and Plot Setup

- Vegetation plot layout: five posts forming a square with diagonals to define 200 m plots; diagonals oriented at right angles.
- Plot positioning: determined by finding the nearest recognizable map point, then navigating by compass; ensure randomness and objectivity.
- Plot markings: avoid linear features on maps; if pacing leads to a feature, relocate and mark accordingly; if plots fall in the way of safety, reject.
- Documentation: five randomised plots are marked on maps; any alterations must be carefully recorded.

## Data Collection within the Plot

- Vegetation data: record all vascular plants, with bryophytes and lichens included in a restricted list; use specified aggregates and identification guidance; classify cover in 5% categories; note edge effects when plots fall in crops.
- Plot diagrams: follow provided figures for plotting and species capture; aim to identify principal species with consistent sampling.

## Soil Pit Procedures

- Soil pit location: center of the quadrat in the quarter containing face number one on the wooden square; if obstructed, move to end-of-strings positions in order (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1); if still obstructed, do not dig.
- Pit dimensions and lighting: typically about 45-60 cm wide and 60-100 cm long; dug to horizon C or R or depth 75 cm, whichever comes first; horizons marked with matchsticks or distinctive stones.
- Horizon descriptors: record horizon boundaries, color, moisture, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, and any notable features; collect soil samples from the surface horizon if appropriate.
- Documentation: complete soil data sheets with detailed horizon and sample information; include comments for interpretation difficulties.

## Linear Features and Quadrat Layout

- Linear plots: not marked on maps; field recorder sites plots in situ.
- Linear plots along hedges, streams, and roads: 10 x 1 m plots located directly on features or standard positions; main species and cover recorded as per the large quadrat method.
- Data sheets: dedicated sheets used for linear features, with location and species data aligned to the feature.

## Data Sheets, Coding and Recording

- Data sheets: vegetation, soil horizon, and related data sheets used to capture standardized information; codes for horizon symbols, color, moisture, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, and other soil attributes.
- Horizon and sample coding: predefined symbol and color keys; multiple codes possible for complex horizons.
- Species identification: curated lists of indicator species, with guidance on uncertain identifications and aggregates; inclusion of Bryophyte and lichen identifications when possible.
- Breeds and Animals: sections for domestic animals (e.g., cattle, sheep, ponies) with breed keys and notes.

## Sketch Maps, Crops, Habitats and Buildings

- Sketch maps: crops and landscape features recorded directly on map copies; write names onto maps; include hedgerows, field boundaries, and notes to aid later interpretation.
- Habitats and vegetation: categorization to reflect dominant vegetation types and landscape features; qualitative abundance notes acceptable when patches are small.
- Crops and agriculture: detailed notes on crops, horticulture, and farm features; include farmer comments where relevant.
- Buildings and infrastructure: vernacular vs non-vernacular architecture, farm buildings, roads, pylons, and other structures documented as context for habitat assessment.

## Data Validation, Completion and Quality Assurance

- Post-field checks: ensure all sheets are complete and consistent; verify species identifications where possible; rectify any omissions.
- Consolidation: clip completed sheets together for a square; cross-check maps and data to ensure no omissions.
- Land Classes: back-of-handbook provides summaries of Land Classes and modifications to aid classification and interpretation.

## Appendices and Land Classes Overview

- Horizon, color, texture, structure, and various soil descriptors: detailed coding schemes and example tables provided for consistent data entry.
- Species and aggregates: guidelines for selecting indicator species; lists of bryophytes and lichens for identification.
- Land Classes: descriptive notes and illustrative thumbnails of land classes (central south, southeast downs, plains, hills, wolds, coastal plains, etc.) to guide interpretation of landscape context within squares.

## Data Governance and Practical Implications for Data Leaders

- Standardization: the methodology emphasizes standardized data sheets, coding, and clear procedures to ensure data comparability across squares.
- Metadata and provenance: explicit steps for recording deviations, permissions, and field conditions to preserve data provenance.
- Reproducibility: detailed plotting, pit placement, sampling rules, and documentation enable reproducible data collection and subsequent analysis.
- User-oriented data products: structured data capture supports downstream analysis, reporting, and sharing with policy colleagues or partner networks.
- Data discoverability and updates: the explicit cataloging of plots, pits, habitats, and boundaries supports data discoverability and iterative updates across the survey program.
