# Countryside Survey 1978 Introduction

## Purpose and scope
- Defines guidelines for field surveys to obtain an overall ecological assessment of a 2 kilometre square sampling unit.
- Aims to be applicable across diverse terrains; records deviations when necessary.
- Data collected support a broad ecological picture, enabling subsequent analysis and data products.

## Survey design and sampling units
- Core sampling structure within each kilometre square:
  - Five vegetation plots of 200 m located randomly.
  - Five soil pits in the centers of those plots.
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information for the entire square.
- Data sheets and keys provided to standardise information (e.g., Cow/S sheep information) and ensure single, coherent data capture.

## Permissions and field access
- On arrival, obtain permission and ownership details before starting work.
- Emphasises short visit duration and minimal disturbance.
- Record owner names and estates; note that fields used for soil pits may include browning crops.

## Plot location and marking
- Plot centers determined objectively, not chosen by preference.
- Locate nearest recognizable map point, then navigate by compass; adjust pace depending on terrain.
- Plot centers marked to avoid linear features; if necessary, relocate and update maps.
- Five plots per square are pre-marked on maps; alterations must be carefully recorded.

## Data collection: vegetation plots
- Record vascular plants completely; bryophytes and lichens recorded selectively.
- Species documented progressively from inner quadrat outward; focus on dominant/indicator species.
- Cover estimates given in broad 5% categories; aim to avoid over- or under-estimation.
- If plots fall in crops or fields, sample edge vegetation and hedgerow/track species.

## Plot description and habitats
- Habitat data begin with slope measurement (highest to lowest point).
- Record aspects and other habitat attributes within the plot, marking uncertainties with notes.
- Data sheets (examples and categories) guide habitat, vegetation, and land-use attributes.

## Vegetation classification and categories
- Provides detailed categories for vegetation structure and land use (woodland, grassland, shrub layers, arable, etc.), including subcategories (hardwood, conifer, mixed, regeneration, dead trees, coppice, etc.).
- Includes agricultural and habitat descriptors (meadow, pasture, crops, fences, hedges, buildings, rubbish, etc.).
- Sketch maps should identify crops and hedgerows as well as dominant habitat types.

## Soil pits: location, description, and sampling
- Soil pit located at the centre of the quadrat; if obstructed, relocate with documented reasoning.
- Pit oriented to maximize light on one end for horizon description; typically 45–60 cm wide and 1 m long.
- Dig until a soil horizon is encountered (to ~75 cm or until horizon descriptions are complete).
- Horizons are described by a structured data sheet, including:
  - Stratum and horizon thickness
  - Colour, moisture, texture, structure
  - Stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans
  - Soil group, parent material, and any notable comments
- Collect small surface samples for horizon analysis, with rules for sampling across horizons when horizons are thin.

## Data sheets and coding
- Horizon symbols and color/mottling/texture/structure codes referenced from back-of-sheet guides.
- Detailed instructions for recording horizon boundaries, thickness, moisture, color, and other properties.
- Completion workflow: fill in stratum, horizon thickness, moisture, color, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, and comments.
- Includes specific forms for soil data and line plots, with examples (e.g., Fig. 5 / Fig. 6 references in the handbook).

## Linear features and directional plots
- Linear plots (two per feature) are 10 x 1 m and completed from hedges, streams, roads, etc.
- Site positioning along the feature is mapped and added to the data sheets and maps.
- Principal species and cover estimates recorded for hedges, streams, and roads.

## Kilometre square data and mapping
- Emphasises completing data for the entire square while allowing for practical limits.
- Sketch maps should record crops, hedges, field boundaries, and other relevant details to aid later interpretation.
- Data sheets compiled and clipped together in the evening; quality checks and data cleaning encouraged.

## Documentation, checklists, and ancillary data
- At the back of the handbook: brief summaries of Land Classes and potential modifications.
- Project checklists and equipment lists provided to ensure comprehensive field preparation and data capture.

## Species identification and aggregates
- Guidelines for identifying species and creating aggregate groups when precise identification is uncertain.
- Indicators and coding lists are provided for plant species, bryophytes, and lichens; lists include representative taxa and common aggregates.
- Specific reference tables outline indicator species and corresponding codes for later data analysis.

## Domestic animals, habitats, and buildings
- Extensive categories for domestic animals (e.g., sheep breeds, cattle, horses, pigs, chickens) and for habitats, buildings, and landscape features.
- Includes vernacular vs. non-vernacular building types, farm structures, garden and orchard features, and other human-made elements.

## Land classes and landscape context
- Notes on land classes describe broad landscape types and the variability within each class.
- Includes guidance on how to interpret and apply land classifications to field data, particularly in Scotland.
- Emphasises that land-class descriptions are guidelines to frame interpretation rather than rigid classifications.

## Conclusions and data integrity
- After fieldwork, verify that all sheets are complete and data are cleaned as much as possible.
- Ensure a balanced, practical approach to data collection rather than over-sampling any single square.
- The culmination is a comprehensive, interpretable dataset ready for ecological assessment and future data products.
