# Countryside Survey 1978

## Overview
- A field handbook defining guidelines for a nationwide ecological survey focused on 2 kilometre square sampling units.
- The methodology emphasizes flexibility to accommodate diverse terrain, with deviations documented.
- Aims to obtain an overall ecological assessment using standardized plot-based sampling and qualitative habitat information.
- Data collected feed into map-based representations and later analyses by GIS specialists and ecologists.

## Sampling Design and Coverage
- Each kilometre square is surveyed to produce a consistent ecological snapshot.
- Within each square:
  - Five vegetation plots (approx. 200 m each) are randomly located and marked.
  - Five soil pits are located in the centers of the vegetation plots.
  - Linear plots are recorded along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information is captured for the entire square.
- The approach supports combining data at different resolutions and aggregating into map-ready formats.

## Plot Location and Setup
- Vegetation plots are set up using five posts and diagonal strings to form the plot frame; diagonals are oriented at right angles.
- Plot centers are determined objectively by locating the nearest recognizable map point and navigating there with a compass.
- If navigation is difficult (open country, lack of features), fixed pacing rules are used to reach near the intended location, emphasizing randomness and avoidance of bias.
- Plots are marked on maps to avoid linear features; if a pacing line crosses a feature, relocation and map marking are performed to keep the plot representative and non-incidentally biased.
- Five randomised plots are designated on the map; any alteration requires careful documentation.

## Data Collected per Plot
- Vegetation: records all vascular plants, restricted bryophytes and lichens; cover estimates are categorized within 5% intervals. Edge vegetation and crop scenarios (e.g., sampling at field edges when crops are present) are noted.
- Species data: a complete species list is compiled for the plot where visible; for difficult identifications, specimens are collected; some species may be omitted if identification is uncertain.
- Documentation and handling: ownership information and permissions are recorded; notes are added for any problems or unusual observations.

## Plot Description and Habitats
- Slope and aspect are measured for each plot using a pole-based setup.
- A comprehensive habitat attribute list is recorded, with entries and notes for difficult classifications.
- Data sheets (illustrated in the handbook) guide the categorization of habitat types, vegetation structure, and dominant species.

## Vegetation and Habitat Coding
- Detailed, hierarchical categories cover:
  - Woodland (hardwood, conifer, mixed, regeneration, dead trees, coppice, glades, etc.)
  - Agriculture and managed landscapes (meadows, pastures, crops, orchards, farm buildings, enclosures, gardens)
  - Boundaries and roads (roads, tracks, hedges, fences, walls, gates, hedgerows, and associated vegetation)
  - Ground features (cliffs, rock outcrops, stones, peat, rivers, ponds, lakes, ditches)
  - Habitats (vegetation types and dominant plant communities)
  - Crops and horticulture (crop types and farming practices)
  - Domestic animals and buildings (animal breeds and vernacular vs non-vernacular structures)
  - Additional features (urban/rural elements, rubbish, drainage, etc.)
- A sketch map accompanies the data, with as much detail as possible about crops, hedgerows, field boundaries, and notable landscape features.

## Soil Pit Methodology
- Soil pits are central to each vegetation plot, oriented to maximize light on one end for horizon description.
- Pit dimensions typically 45–60 cm wide and about 1 m long, extending to the C, Cr, or R horizon (up to 75 cm).
- Horizons are marked with identifiers; key horizon descriptors include:
  - Moisture status, color, mottles, texture, structure, stone content, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, soil group, and parent material.
  - Presence/absence of carbonates, iron pans, earthworms; horizon boundaries traced with markers.
  - Special notes for difficult horizons and additional horizon-related comments.
- Soil sampling guidelines:
  - Collect small samples from the surface horizon (or from underlying horizons if the surface is too thin) for laboratory analysis.
  - Record horizon thicknesses along a single vertical line for irregular boundaries.

## Linear Features and Sampling
- Linear plots (2 per feature) are 10 m by 1 m and are completed along hedges, streams, and roads.
- Location is tied to the feature (hedges aligned from the center, roads along edges, streams at water edge) with permanent water preferred for streams.
- Species identification follows the same rules as the large plots, and principal species cover is estimated along the feature.

## Boundaries and Map Documentation
- Boundaries, walls, fences, hedges, and hedgerows are documented with both direct field measurements and map-based estimates where needed.
- Codes and categories are used to describe the condition, age, and structure of boundaries (e.g., old, new, derelict, hedgerow trees, wall type, etc.).
- For hedges, woody species composition is recorded with an estimate of the principal components.

## Sketch Map and Crops
- All crops and landscape features are recorded on a sketch map, preferably labelled with farmer-provided names or local designations where possible.
- Woodlands, hedgerows, and field boundaries are annotated to provide a clearer picture for later interpretation and GIS mapping.

## Domestic Animals and Buildings
- Domestic animals are identified via farmer consultation or by keys provided in the handbook.
- Breed distinctions (especially for sheep) are documented using pictures and keys. If necessary, cross-squares are used to infer breeds observed elsewhere.

## Habitats, Aquatic, and Natural Features
- Habitat categories cover vegetation types, aquatic environments (streams, ditches, pools), and marine-adjacent features when relevant.
- Special notes accompany aquatic and marine habitats to capture movement and water features.

## Data Coding, Aggregates, and Indicator Species
- The handbook provides guidelines for species identification and the aggregation of species into ecological indicators.
- Codes reference a comprehensive list of plant and animal aggregates; when species identification is uncertain, some species are excluded from indicator lists.
- A predefined set of bryophyte and lichen identifications is included, along with a list of lichens and their common groupings.

## Land Classes and Upland Descriptions
- The document includes notes and photographic references to upland land classes, describing the range of landscapes from central and southern lowlands to upland moors and coastal areas.
- Land classes cover factors such as relief, drainage, pasture vs arable balance, hedgerows, and forestry presence, to guide interpretation of landscape-scale GIS analyses.

## Equipment and Checklists
- A project checklist outlines required field equipment (surveyor poles, soil fans, clipping tools, trowels, knives, etc.) and preparation for data collection.
- Checklists emphasize data cleanliness, consistent coding, and cross-checking of sheets and maps before concluding the survey for a square.

## End-of-Survey Procedures
- After plotting and data collection, participants review all sheets for completeness and consistency.
- Data are prepared for integration into the kilometre square map, ensuring that everything is ready for GIS processing and later analysis.

## Practical Considerations for GIS Specialists
- Rich, multi-layer dataset: vegetation, soils, hydrology, boundaries, habitats, crops, and buildings, all with standardized codes.
- Emphasis on documentation of deviations, validations, and the rationale for any plot relocations or method changes.
- Data sheets and legend codes designed for GIS compatibility and downstream analytics, enabling spatial mapping and landscape-scale analyses.
- Clear guidance on data quality, sampling randomness, and reproducibility across different squares and terrains.
