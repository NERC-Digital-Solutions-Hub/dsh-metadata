# Countryside Survey 1978

- Objective
  - Provide an overall ecological assessment of a 2-kilometre square sampling unit.
  - Standardised data collection to enable comparison across squares.
  - Data types collected include vegetation plots, soil pits, linear features, and broad square-wide ecological information.

- Survey design and sampling framework
  - Five randomly located 200 m vegetation plots per square.
  - Five randomly located soil pits (center of plots) for soil horizon analysis.
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information gathered for the whole kilometre square.
  - Data harmonised with reference keys and tables (vegetation, soils, boundaries, habitats).

- Permissions and on-site logistics
  - Obtain ownership information before starting; keep visits brief with minimal disturbance.
  - Document owner names and land tenure details in the data sheets when possible.
  - For cropping areas, soil pits may be placed in farmed fields with appropriate notes.

- Plot location and establishment
  - Plot centres determined objectively, not chosen to favour particular features.
  - Locate using the nearest identifiable map point and navigate by compass; diagonals oriented at right angles.
  - Five randomly located plots marked on maps; relocate if obstructed by features or risk.
  - If a plot cannot be placed due to safety or access, record reason and move to the next arbitrary position.
  - Mark plots on maps to avoid linear features; record any relocation on the map.

- Vegetation sampling and data collection
  - Record all vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens; follow exclusion lists for uncertain identifications.
  - Estimation of cover within 5% categories; hierarchical recording when multiple layers are present.
  - If a plot lies within a cultivated field, sample from the field edge and use edge species for the plot’s vegetation description.
  - A diagram and detailed guidance (Fig. 3) illustrate the sampling scheme and species recording protocol.

- Plot description and habitats
  - Measure slope and aspect for each plot (from highest to lowest point; orientation through poles and sightlines).
  - Record habitat attributes within 50 m of the plot and note any interpretation challenges.
  - Data sheets guide entries for vegetation type, woodland structure, and other habitat features (Fig. 4).

- Vegetation and habitat classification
  - Detailed categories for vegetation types (woodland, grassland, scrub, arable, moorland, bog, etc.).
  - Woodland subcategories (hardwood, conifer, mixed, isolated trees, coppice, regeneration, dead trees, glades, hedgerows, etc.).
  - Agricultural/land-use categories (meadow, pasture, rough grazing, cereal, root crops, other arable, horticulture, farm buildings, enclosures, gardens, orchards, recreation areas, drainage, rubbish).
  - Boundaries and roads (road, track, footpath, fences, hedges, hedgerow characteristics, and stockproofing).
  - Ground features (cliffs, rocks, scree, stones/rocks, excavation/quarry, banks, wood, soil moisture and peat, streams, ponds, rivers, lakes).
  - Animals and habitats sections (domestic animals, birds, and other wildlife indicators).
  - Sketch map requirements: record crops, hedgerows, field boundaries, woodlands, and notable landscape features; annotate with notes helpful for interpretation.

- Soil pit methodology
  - Soil pit located at the centre of the quadrat in the quadrant containing face number one on the wooden square.
  - If obstruction prevents ideal placement, relocate to closest permissible position and document reason.
  - Pit orientation chosen so maximum light falls on one end; typical dimensions 45–60 cm wide by ~1 m long; reach horizon C or R, or depth ~75 cm, whichever comes first.
  - Horizons identified and boundaries marked; horizon boundaries recorded with lines or markers.
  - Soil data sheet captures horizon depth, colour, moisture, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, soil group, parent material, and additional horizon notes.
  - Collect small surface samples for horizon < 5 cm; sample from underlying horizon if needed.
  - Horizon coding and laboratory-style notes accompany the field data sheets.

- Soil data and coding
  - Data sheets specify stratum, horizon thickness, horizon symbol, moisture status, colour, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, and comments.
  - Possible need to record multiple horizon observations along a vertical line.
  - Special notes for problematic horizons (e.g., very stony horizons) and guidance on horizon boundary irregularities.

- Linear features sampling
  - Linear plots (10 x 1 m) placed along hedges, streams, and roads.
  - Conducted in a direct line from the two most widely spaced plots within the square.
  - Mark plot strings along the feature and use a 1 m staff to trace curves.
  - For hedges, sample along the hedge centerline; for roads, sample along the edge; for streams, sample along the water’s edge.
  - Include principal species cover for woody stems in hedges; apply same vegetation identification rules as in the main plots.
  - Data sheets and figures provide placement guidance (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).

- Crops, sketch maps, and field notes
  - Document agricultural crops and horticultural features; capture farmer comments on varieties and practices.
  - Sketch map should identify crops, hedgerows, field boundaries, and key landscape features; annotate directly on a photocopy for later interpretation.
  - Collect additional notes to enhance the visual and ecological picture of the square without clutter.

- Domestic animals, habitats, and buildings
  - Record domestic animals via farmer information or field keys; breed sheets and visual references assist identification.
  - Habitat categories extend to aquatic, rock, and built environments; provide context in the sketch map.

- Equipment, data management, and quality control
  - Use a comprehensive project checklist (Project 424) to ensure all tools and forms are ready (poles, sheets, compass, trowels, brushes, etc.).
  - Complete and check all data sheets for each square; ensure species identifications are robust and data are clean and consistent.
  - Make datasets discoverable with metadata and, where appropriate, upload to relevant portals.

- Land classes and regional variation
  - The handbook includes notes on Land Classes to contextualise landscapes (e.g., Central South, South-east uplands, Plain, Wolds, Uplands, Highlands, coastal areas).
  - Descriptions illustrate broad landscape characteristics, typical land use, and variation, aiding interpretation across different squares and regions.

- Conclusions and post-survey steps
  - After fieldwork, verify completeness of all sheets, collate into a single kilometre square form, and review for missing data.
  - Use land-class templates and notes to inform modular analyses and cross-square comparisons.
  - The back of the handbook provides brief summaries of Land Classes and potential modifications for future surveys.
