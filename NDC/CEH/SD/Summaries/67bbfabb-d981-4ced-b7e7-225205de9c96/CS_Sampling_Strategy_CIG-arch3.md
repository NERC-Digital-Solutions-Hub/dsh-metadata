# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview and Aim
- Documents the sampling strategy for the field survey element of Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
- Shows the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its application to successive CS surveys (1978–2007).
- Emphasizes linking sampling design to policy-relevant habitat and landscape estimates, while enabling country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland).

## Core Concepts: Stratification and Sampling Framework
- Stratified random sampling is used to ensure representative coverage across ecological land classes.
- A 1 km square sampling unit is employed, chosen to balance survey workload with ecological representativeness.
- An initial stratification framework (ITE Land Classification) groups land by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to create discrete strata.
- Early sampling relied on selecting centre squares of larger grids (15 x 15 km) and classifying surrounding squares to form a total set of classified squares for national estimates.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification
- 1970s: Grounded in vegetation classification, using environmental attributes to form land classes.
- 1978 CS: 32 Land Classes derived from ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) on 1 km squares; 8 samples per class were selected (256 total squares) for field surveys of habitat area estimation.
- 1984 CS: Emphasis shifts to land use and habitat mapping; sample size per class increased to 12 squares (total 384).
- 1990 CS: All GB squares are classified using an expanded Land Classification; 508 squares surveyed; incorporation of a Land Cover Map from satellite data; existing class structure revised to integrate all squares.
- 1998 CS: Classification expanded to 40 Land Classes to support regional and Scotland-specific reporting; survey expanded to 569 squares.
- 2000 CS: Aimed to produce separate country estimates (England & Wales; Scotland); class subdivisions and aggregations created to support country-based reporting; 40 strata adjusted to around 40–45, with additional country-specific sampling and an upland module added.

## Separate Country Estimates and Sampling Adjustments
- Introduction of country-unit estimates to meet policy and legislative needs (England with Wales; Scotland).
- Land Classes subdivided to create England-with-Wales and Scotland-specific versions; aggregation used where classes were sparse within a country.
- Additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new country-specific classes.
- Wales-specific adjustments included deeper Wales-focused sampling due to policy needs and to improve precision for Welsh-only reporting.

## Wales- and England- / Scotland-Specific Adjustments (CS2007)
- Wales required further Welsh-only sub-classes (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increased Welsh squares to improve Wales-only estimates.
- England retained most classes but some English classes (5e, 15e) had reduced square counts due to balancing precision across the UK.
- The 2007 framework produced 45 strata (up from 40) reflecting country-unit subdivisions.
- Wales received 107 total Welsh squares in CS2007 (compared to 64 in CS2000); England retained higher counts but with some reductions in specific classes.
- An updated class map (England with Wales and Scotland) reflects these changes.

## The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey: Uplands Module
- CS2000 and CS2007 include an uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland and marginal upland areas of England and Wales.
- An additional module added 30 squares placed within upland land classes to enhance statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates.

## Data and Reporting Considerations
- The strategy emphasizes aligning sample distribution with land class area to minimize statistical error in national estimates.
- National estimates must consider changes in land classification over time; the 2006 scoping study notes that shifting the classification basis affects comparability across surveys.
- Publication pathways include CS main reports and country-specific outputs (e.g., Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007).

## Summary of Key Developments by Survey Year
- 1978 CS: 256 squares (8 per 32 Land Classes); ISA-based classification; foundational stratified sampling.
- 1984 CS: 384 squares; expansion to 12 squares per class; shift toward land use and habitat mapping.
- 1990 CS: All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; introduction of satellite-derived Land Cover Map; national estimates based on revised classification.
- 1998 CS: 569 squares; Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; Scotland reporting enabled.
- 2000 CS: England with Wales and Scotland-specific country-unit estimates; 40–45 strata; upland habitat module introduced; additional country-specific sampling.
- 2007 CS: Wales-focused adjustments; five new Welsh sub-classes; 43 additional Welsh squares; overall framework increases to 45 strata; Wales sampling intensified for country-specific reporting; England and Scotland sampling adjusted accordingly; upland sampling continues.

## Implications for Monitoring Framework Authors
- Demonstrates a long-running, iterative approach to environmental monitoring design, balancing:
  - Consistency over time with evolving classifications.
  - Granularity required for country-specific policy reporting.
  - Allocation of sampling resources to underrepresented classes and upland habitats.
- Highlights the importance of stratification, representative sampling, and the challenges of data comparability across successive classification frameworks.
- Illustrates practical decisions around adding modules (uplands), subdividing classes, and increasing sample densities in targeted regions to meet policy needs.
