# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Shows the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify a national ecological sampling program in Great Britain over 30 years.
  - Emphasizes the linkage between classification, sampling design, and time-series change detection.

- Core concept: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling
  - Land Classification: environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) used to classify land into discrete classes for representative sampling.
  - Stratified, random sampling: samples drawn from each land class to ensure coverage across ecological variability.
  - Early rationale: avoid bias from purely random samples and ensure samples represent different land types and processes.

- Key methodological milestones and evolution
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - 32 land classes derived from 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid) using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to group environmental attributes.
    - Sampling: eight samples per class, total of 256 1 km squares surveyed.
    - Output: national estimates of habitat areas by class (based on class areas and mean habitat area per square).
  - 1984 (Second land-use survey)
    - Framework retained; sampling increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (total 384).
    - Focus shifted to land use, landscape features and habitat mapping.
  - 1990 (CS1990 and All-Squares Land Classification)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every 1 km square in GB (all-squares approach).
    - 508 squares surveyed; included repeat vegetation quadrats from 1978.
    - Resulted in Land Cover maps linked to the classification; later published (CS1990 main report, 1993).
    - Challenge noted: when extending to all squares, some classification correspondence with the original was only 62%, though most shifts were to neighboring classes.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Addressed policy needs for regional and separate Scotland/England/Wales reporting.
    - Developed a new Land Classification with 40 classes and enabled country-unit estimates (England with Wales, Scotland separately).
    - Adjustments to ensure adequate representation across country units; introduced class sub-division and aggregation to form 40 strata; added 19 extra squares (plus targeted sampling to Wales for country-specific reporting).
    - Added uplands module to improve estimates for upland habitats.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-specific reporting requirements prompted further refinements.
    - Created Wales-specific country-unit classes (five new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), expanding to 45 strata.
    - Additional sampling: 43 extra Welsh squares to ensure representation; two English classes (5e, 15e) left with four squares each; overall precision deemed acceptable for reporting purposes.
    - Wales and England/Scotland mappings updated; uplands module continued.

- Country-specific reporting and sampling refinements
  - Separate country estimates introduced to provide England with Wales, and Scotland, distinct reporting units.
  - Class sub-division and aggregation used to create 40 (then 45) strata tailored to country units.
  - Isle of Man adjustments: replaced two Isle of Man squares with two new England squares to avoid contributing to country-unit estimates.

- Upland and policy-focused modules
  - CS2000 introduced an uplands module (30 additional squares) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- Outputs and data products
  - Land Classification maps and revised class maps (illustrated in Figures 4–7).
  - tabular summaries of squares by class, country unit, and survey year (Tables 2 and 3; plus detailed per-class counts and sampling rates).
  - National and country-specific estimates of habitat areas derived from class statistics and square-level data.
  - Foundational references and appendices include a brief history of the ITE Land Classification (Appendix i).

- Data governance, comparability, and notes
  - Note on national estimates: changing the underlying Land Classification affects consistency of stock estimates; for a given survey, it is preferred to use the latest classification, but original classifications may be used for cross-survey comparability.
  - The document emphasizes maintaining methodological transparency and documenting changes to classification, sampling, and country-unit definitions to support time-series analysis.

- Implications for data management and leadership
  - Maintain clear data lineage: document when and why Land Classification changes occurred, and how samples map to classes across surveys.
  - Ensure robust metadata and versioning for time-series data to support country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland) and upland modules.
  - Plan for representation biases: address under-represented classes or regions (e.g., Wales, uplands) with targeted sampling to improve precision.
  - Facilitate data discoverability and reuse: preserve maps, class definitions, sample counts, and methodological notes for future analyses and policy needs.
