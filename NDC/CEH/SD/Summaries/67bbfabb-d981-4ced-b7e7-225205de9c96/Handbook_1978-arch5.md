# Countryside Survey 1978 Introduction

- Purpose and approach
  - Guidelines define the field survey methods; no rigid rules for all situations due to wide variability.
  - Deviations from the basic methodology should be recorded; otherwise, methods are straightforward and familiar to participants.
  - Objective: obtain an ecological assessment of a 2 kilometre square sampling unit in as consistent a way as possible.

- Survey design and data types
  - The programme for each square includes:
    - Five randomly located 200 m vegetation plots.
    - Five randomly located soil pits in the centres of the plots.
    - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
    - Broad ecological information for the whole square.
  - The handbook progresses through vegetation, soil, and other data; keys to information (e.g., Cow/S sheep) are provided.

- Permissions and ownership
  - On arrival, obtain ownership information before starting work when possible.
  - Emphasize brief visits with minimal disturbance.
  - Requests for information are the surveyor’s responsibility; owners’ names and farm details should be recorded at the end of the relevant sheets.
  - Cropping or land use notes (e.g., bealands for soil pits) should be documented.

- Plot location and marking
  - Vegetation plots are 200 m, marked with five posts; a compass-based navigation method is used to locate the centre.
  - The plot centre is positioned by approaching from the nearest map feature; only minor adjustments are allowed.
  - Plots are recorded on maps to avoid linear features; if a plot would fall near a linear feature, relocate and mark adjustments on the map.
  - Five randomised plots are marked on maps; any alterations should be carefully recorded.
  - Species data are recorded progressively from the inner quadrat outward; all vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens are included with specified aggregates.

- Plot data collection and habitats
  - Plot descriptions begin with slope measurement (highest to lowest point) and aspect; the height/line of sight is used to determine measurements.
  - Attributes within the plot and within 50 metres are recorded; notes are added for difficult categories.
  - Vegetation categories and habitat types are defined (e.g., woodland types, moorland, grassland, arable, hedges, boundaries, and various habitat classes).

- Soil pits and horizon descriptions
  - Soil pits are placed at the centre of the quadrat within the quarter containing face number one.
  - If obstructions prevent centre placement, move to adjacent strings and record the reason for the move.
  - Soil pits are typically 45–60 cm wide and 1 m long; depth continues until reaching a C/R horizon or 75 cm, whichever comes first.
  - Horizons are described by color, moisture, texture, structure, stone content, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, soil group, parent material, and any other notable features.
  - Sampling:
    - Collect a surface horizon sample (~200 g) or from the underlying horizon if the surface is too thin.
    - Depths and sampling rules are provided to ensure uncontaminated samples.

- Data sheets and coding
  - How to complete data sheets (vegetation and soil) with standardized fields:
    - Stratum, horizon thickness, horizon symbol, moisture status, color, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, and additional comments.
  - Horizon symbol and color codes, texture and structure codes, stone sizes and percentages, and other coding schemes are specified.
  - A detailed example of data organization is provided (including sample codes and fields for soil horizons and pit descriptions).

- Linear features and kilometric coverage
  - Linear plots are 10 x 1 m and placed on hedges, streams, and roads.
  - Data sheets for linear plots follow the same species identification rules as the large quadrats.
  - In hedges, roads, and streams, permanent water courses are recorded; ditches are included; correlations with principal species are noted.
  - The kilometre square data sheets and sketch map are used to capture broader land cover and features; all crops, hedgerows, and field boundaries should be recorded with as much detail as possible without excessive clutter.

- Boundaries and boundaries categories
  - Boundaries may be marked directly or estimated; categories include walls, fences, hedges, bank structures, hedgerow trees, and various states of maintenance or deterioration.
  - Hedge categories cover complete hedges, hedges with gaps, hedges on walls, hedgerow trees, hedgerow management, and hedgerow removal.

- Habitats, crops, and sketches
  - Habitats and vegetation are indicated on sketch maps; dominant species are identified where possible, with patches noted when abundant enough to show.
  - Crops and horticultural practices are categorized; additional farmer notes may be included.
  - Sketch maps aim to provide a detailed representation of square characteristics, boundary lines, hedgerows, woodlands, and habitat distributions.

- Domestic animals, buildings, and landscape descriptors
  - The survey records domestic animals and breeds with practical keys; breeds can be cross-checked using adjacent squares.
  - Building types and vernacular styles (local, non-local) are categorized; architecture notes may include decorative and functional features.
  - The survey includes provisions for describing the overall landscape, including notable features such as glacial landforms and rugged terrain.

- Conclusions and quality control
  - After completing plots and the kilometre square sheet, verify all sheets and clip them together; resolve any data collection issues (e.g., species identifications) to ensure clean data.
  - A back-of-book section provides brief summaries of land classes and modifications for practical use.

- Appendices and references
  - Horizon symbol legend, color, moisture, texture, structure, and related data coding tables.
  - Guidelines for species identification and aggregates, with exemplar codes for selected bryophytes, lichens, and higher plants.
  - Lists of bryophytes, liverworts, and mosses; lichen species lists for field identification.
  - Landscape land classes and notes on Ul/land classes, including a multi-class schema for Central South, Southeast downs, plains, coastal landscapes, and upland/woods typologies.
  - Project checklists and equipment lists to support field data collection and field team readiness.
