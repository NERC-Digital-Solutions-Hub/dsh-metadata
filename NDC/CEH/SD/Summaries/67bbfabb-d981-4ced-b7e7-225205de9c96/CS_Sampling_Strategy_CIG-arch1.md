# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Aims: describes the field survey sampling framework used by Countryside Survey up to 2007, grounded in the ITE Land Classification; enables national, regional, and country-specific estimates and supports time-series analysis of habitat change.

- Core concept: stratified, random sampling using the ITE Land Classification as the stratification framework to ensure samples are representative of Britain's diverse landscapes.

- Data focus for analysts: provides the methodology to assign each 1 km square to a land class, how many squares are surveyed per class, how national estimates are computed, and how classification changes affect time-series comparisons.

## Land Classification: Evolution and Foundations

- Origins: developed in the 1970s from vegetation quadrat work, scaled to 1 km squares, using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to define land classes.

- Methodology: initial use of Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to group squares into classes; each class represents similar environmental conditions and potential ecological characteristics.

- Practical outcome: a stratified sampling framework where the landscape is carved into discrete land classes (initially 32 classes in the mid- to late-1970s).

- Key rationale for stratification: to minimize sampling bias and ensure all parts of the population (land types) are represented in the survey.

## Sampling Framework by Survey Year

- 1978 (Initial National Survey)
  - Classification: 32 ITE Land Classes derived from 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1,228 centre squares classified; plus four surrounding squares per centre square).
  - Sample: eight squares per land class (total 256 squares) surveyed in one field season.
  - Output: national estimates of habitat areas based on mean area per square within each land class times the land class area.

- 1984 (Second GB Survey)
  - Expansion: sampling framework unchanged, but total squares increased by 50% to 12 squares per land class (including previously visited eight), totaling 384 squares.
  - Focus: shift toward land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
  - Change: Land Classification updated to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; some squares reassigned.
  - Sample: 508 squares surveyed.
  - Link: first Land Cover Map of GB (from satellite imagery) linked to this program.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; Fourth Field Survey)
  - Issue: need for regional (especially Scottish) reporting; Land Classification expanded to allow separate reporting for Scotland; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
  - Implication: national estimates based on a revised classification; data kept comparable through careful methodological notes.

## Separate Country Estimates and Wales/Isle of Man Adjustments

- England & Wales vs Scotland reporting: to provide country-specific estimates, the sampling framework was adapted so estimates could be produced for England with Wales and for Scotland using only squares within the respective country.

- Key changes for CS2000 (England & Wales; Scotland)
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating 40 strata from 32).
  - Aggregation of sparse classes within a country to maintain representation.
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes (minimum six squares per new class; 11 extra squares to balance between England and Wales).
  - Wales-specific refinements: sub-division of Land Class 17 in Wales to improve Wales-only reporting.
  - Isle of Man: the two previous IOM squares replaced by two new squares in England for country-unit reporting.

- Welsh adjustments for CS2007
  - Wales required more granular Welsh-only reporting; five new country-unit classes created: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w.
  - Increased total strata to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares; minimum six squares per Welsh class.
  - England retained most classes but two English classes (5e, 15e) ended with four squares each due to relative precision considerations.

- Summary of CS2000 and CS2007 sampling
  - CS2000 introduced 40 strata with additional country-unit subdivisions and more squares to improve country-specific estimates.
  - CS2007 further refined the country-unit framework and Welsh coverage to support Wales-only reporting.

## Uplands Module (CS2000)

- An additional module funded to improve habitat estimates in uplands and marginal uplands of England and Wales.
- Added 30 squares in upland-land-class areas to increase statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates when producing country-specific results.

## Outputs, Comparability, and National Estimates

- How estimates are computed: national estimates are derived by multiplying the mean habitat area per square within a land class by the land class area, then aggregating across classes.

- Time-series considerations: changes in the Land Classification over time affect consistency of national estimates; the report discusses how to maintain comparability via using the latest classification for within-survey consistency or the original classification for cross-survey comparability.

- Cross-year guidance: for GB-level consistency, the 1990 Land Classification (and its successors) can be used, but national estimates can be produced with either the latest country-specific classifications or the original 1990 framework to maintain comparability.

- Output documentation: detailed tables (e.g., CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) describe the number of squares, strata areas, sampling rates, and country-specific sampling arrangements; national estimates and country-specific reports are published in corresponding Countryside Survey volumes.

## Practical Implications for Analysts

- Data structure: analyses rely on classifying each 1 km square into a land class, and then aggregating by class area and per-square habitat metrics to estimate national and country-level totals.

- Data quality and standardization: earlier classification schemes (32 classes) were expanded to 40 and then 45 through country-unit subdivisions; analysts must account for reclassification or remapping of squares when merging across survey years.

- Data accessibility: national and country-specific reports exist for different years (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) with detailed methodology and class maps; researchers should consult these reports for exact class definitions, sampling frames, and country-specific adjustments.

- Meta considerations: when building cross-year models or comparing habitat estimates, be mindful of classification changes (e.g., class subdivisions, reassignments) and choose a consistent basis (latest within-survey vs. original) depending on the analysis goal.

## Timeline of Developments (Key Milestones)

- 1978: First GB ecological survey; 32 Land Classes; eight squares per class; center squares plus surrounding squares classified.
- 1984: 12 squares per Land Class; total 384 squares; shift toward land use and landscape features.
- 1990: All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; Land Cover Map linked.
- 1998: Land Classification expanded to 40 classes for Scotland reporting; national estimates aligned to a broader regional framework.
- 2000: CS2000 introduces country-unit estimates (England with Wales; Scotland); subdivisions and additional squares; uplands module considered for England and Wales.
- 2007: CS2007 refines Wales reporting with country-unit subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total 45 strata; Wales receives more squares; English classes adjusted to maintain precision. Wales-specific upland reporting enhancements pursued.

- Note: For consistency in national estimates, the report discusses using either the latest classification (with separate country classifications) or the original 1990 Land Classification for cross-survey comparisons.
