- The document defines coded classifications for two attribute groups used in infrastructure datasets: road/track characteristics and built-environment types, each with an associated condition.
- Road/Track Type codes:
  - 1 Major (paved)
  - 2 Major (unpaved)
  - 3 Minor (paved)
  - 4 Minor (unpaved)
  - 5 Track (unpaved)
- Road/Track Condition codes:
  - 1 Intact
  - 2 Obstructed/damaged
- Built-environment Type codes:
  - 1 Residential (permanent)
  - 2 Residential (informal/temporary)
  - 3 Industrial (i.e., hydropower)
  - 4 Municipal
- Built-environment Condition codes:
  - 1 Intact
  - 2 Obstructed/damaged

- As a data steward, you would need to ensure clear, standardized definitions and consistent use of these codes, along with robust metadata.
- Key considerations for governance:
  - Define exact semantics for each code and thresholds for "Intact" vs "Obstructed/damaged."
  - Provide a data dictionary with allowed values, definitions, and examples.
  - Implement validation to enforce valid codes and ensure both Type and Condition are captured.
  - Plan for data provenance, versioning, and update mechanisms when datasets are refreshed.
  - Address interoperability across systems and formats, including potential needs for mapping or transformation.
- Practical implications:
  - Useful for classifying infrastructure and tracking status (e.g., maintenance prioritization).
  - Enables filtering by road type/condition and built-environment type/condition for analyses and planning.
  - Be mindful of data timeliness, completeness, and potential need for additional attributes to meet user needs.
