# Type and Condition Codes for Roads and Land Use

## Overview
- Provides a coding schema to classify infrastructure features for monitoring and reporting.
- Divides data into two feature classes: roads and land-use/facilities, each with a Type and a Condition.

## Road Classification (First section)

- Type codes:
  - 1 - Major (paved)
  - 2 - Major (unpaved)
  - 3 - Minor (paved)
  - 4 - Minor (unpaved)
  - 5 - Track (unpaved)

- Condition codes:
  - 1 - Intact
  - 2 - Obstructed/damaged

## Land-Use / Facility Classification (Second section)

- Type codes:
  - 1 - Residential (permanent)
  - 2 - Residential (informal/temporary)
  - 3 - Industrial i.e. hydropower
  - 4 - Municipal

- Condition codes:
  - 1 - Intact
  - 2 - Obstructed/damaged

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- Enables standardized data capture and comparability across datasets.
- Facilitates assessment of infrastructure integrity and land-use status for environmental health monitoring.
- Highlights data governance needs (metadata, sharing, and quality assurance) and potential data quality issues (e.g., typos and inconsistent terminology).
