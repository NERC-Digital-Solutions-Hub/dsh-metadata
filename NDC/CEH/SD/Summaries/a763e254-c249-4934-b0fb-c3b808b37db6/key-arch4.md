# Type and Condition Codes for Roads and Settlements

## Overview
- Defines standardized coding schemes for two data dimensions: road/track classifications and settlement types, each with a corresponding condition indicator.
- Supports consistent data capture, metadata, and discoverability across datasets.

## Road/Track Type Codes
- 1 Major (paved)
- 2 Major (unpaved)
- 3 Minor (paved)
- 4 Minor (unpaved)
- 5 Track (unpaved)

## Road/Track Condition Codes
- 1 Intact
- 2 Obstructed/damaged

## Settlement/Area Type Codes
- 1 Residential (permanent)
- 2 Residential (informal/temporary)
- 3 Industrial (e.g., hydropower)
- 4 Municipal

## Settlement/Area Condition Codes
- 1 Intact
- 2 Obstructed/damaged

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Enables consistent interpretation of road and settlement attributes across systems.
- Highlights the need for clear metadata and data quality checks to ensure correct usage of codes.
- Supports user-focused product development through standardized categorization.

## Considerations and Next Steps
- Ensure alignment of these codes with existing data standards and user needs.
- Integrate provenance, source, timestamp, and geometry metadata to enhance discoverability and reliability.
- Plan for data quality management to address potential gaps, inconsistencies, or overlaps between datasets.
