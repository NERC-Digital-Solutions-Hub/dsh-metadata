# Road and Land-Use Type and Condition Dataset

## Overview
- Defines standardized categories for recording and monitoring environmental infrastructure and land use.
- Supports consistent data verification, cleaning, transformation, and reporting for environmental health assessment.

## Road Types and Condition
- Type codes:
  - 1 - Major (paved)
  - 2 - Major (unpaved)
  - 3 - Minor (paved)
  - 4 - Minor (unpaved)
  - 5 - Track (unpaved)
- Condition codes:
  - 1 - Intact
  - 2 - Obstructed/damaged

## Land-Use Types and Condition
- Type codes:
  - 1 - Residential (permanent)
  - 2 - Residential (informal/temporary)
  - 3 - Industrial (e.g., hydropower)
  - 4 - Municipal
- Condition codes:
  - 1 - Intact
  - 2 - Obstructed/damaged

## How Analysts Monitoring the Environment Use This
- Verify, quality assure, clean, and transform data from established sources.
- Apply standardized analysis methods to categorize environmental health against standards.
- Produce outputs in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and store/upload datasets to appropriate portals.

## Key Challenges
- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data (avoiding single-use data).
- Enabling access to the underlying data used to produce final outputs.
