# Experimental design/sampling regime

- Scope and approach
  - UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) collects butterfly counts from over 1,000 sites annually across the UK.
  - Uses standardized, repeatable sampling methods to enable year-to-year comparison and trend analysis.

- Sampling design and routes
  - All-species transects: fixed-route line transects (2–4 km) sampled weekly during suitable weather from early April to late September; data captured in a 5 m wide band along the transect.
  - Transect routes are fixed to reflect habitat types and management; route stability is essential for comparability.
  - Single-species transects follow the all-species method but focus on one or a few weeks for the focal species.
  - Timed counts and egg/larval web counts supplement transect data for particular species.

- Recording and timing constraints
  - Observations conducted between 10:45 and 15:45, under weather conditions conducive to butterfly activity (e.g., dry, Beaufort <5, minimum temperature thresholds with sunshine/overcast adjustments).
  - Weekly counts during the core flight period; typical transect visits occur within the specified daily window.

- Data collection and workflow
  - Site location data collected in the field; entered into Transect Walker software (free download) by the recorder or regional transect coordinator.
  - Data for a changed route treated as a new site; new site data are managed via the same submission process.
  - Transect Walker outputs are uploaded to an Oracle database that stores all records.

- Data types and measurements
  - Site location data include OS grid reference, transect length, and number of sections.
  - Grid references are decomposed into Easting and Northing coordinates.
  - The data record includes the site number, site name, grid reference, Easting, Northing, transect length, country, number of sections, and years surveyed.

- Quality control and validation
  - Regional transect coordinators review incoming data for their sites.
  - Data undergo automated and manual validation procedures to verify site location data and overall integrity.
  - Some site information may be incomplete; regional oversight provides initial quality checks.

- Data format and storage
  - Site location data are stored as CSV files with defined columns (site number, site name, grid reference, Easting, Northing, length, country, number of sections, number of years surveyed, first year surveyed, last year surveyed).
  - Centralized storage via an Oracle database ensures centralized access and governance of the dataset.
