# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) percentage cover of plant species on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- A dataset describing the percentage cover of plant species on saltmarsh sites in Morecambe Bay and Essex.
- Measurements taken at 1m x 1m quadrats, focusing on plant community composition.
- Collected during a field campaign in Winter and Summer 2013.
- Sites chosen to represent contrasting soil types (clay in Essex; sandy in Morecambe Bay), and differing inundation, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
- Grazing regimes differ between regions: Essex sites heavily grazed by over-wintering Brent geese; Morecambe Bay sites heavily grazed by sheep with pink-footed geese in winter; one West Plain site lightly grazed.

## Study Sites and Context
- Essex:
  - Abbotts Hall (AH)
  - Fingringhoe Wick (FW)
  - Tillingham Marshes (TM)
  - Coordinates for each site are provided.
- Morecambe Bay:
  - Cartmel Sands (CS)
  - Warton Sands (WS)
  - West Plain (WP) included in field descriptions
  - Coordinates for each site are provided.
- Sites represent two soil types (clay in Essex, sandy in Morecambe Bay) and different inundation, creek structures, and vegetation types.

## Data Collection, Sampling Design, and Variables
- Monitoring occurred as part of a general field campaign during Winter and Summer 2013.
- Primary response variable: plant percentage cover by species per quadrat.
- Data are organized in an Excel workbook with a detailed field description (per-species percentage cover and corresponding counts).
- Quadrat resolution: 1m x 1m (Quadrat numbers 1 to 22 per record).
- Locations and habitats include:
  - Habitats: Saltmarsh (SM) and Mudflat (MF)
  - Scales: A (1m), B (1–10m), C (10–100m), D (100m and up)
- Site and habitat metadata:
  - Sites: Morecambe (CS, WS, WP) and Essex (AH, FW, TM)
  - Seasons: Winter (W) and Summer (S)
  - Additional non-typical or supplementary observations: Urtica dioica (nettle; not typical saltmarsh sp), mosses, Bostrychia/Cladophora (algal associations), bare mud, litter, animal droppings, standing dead.
- Variables/parameters explicitly observed or listed as fields include many plant species (e.g., Agrostis stolonifera, Armeria maritima, Aster tripolium, Salicornia spp., Spartina spp., etc.) with corresponding percentage cover and a secondary numeric field labeled as the count for many species.

## Data Structure and Metadata
- Source format: Excel workbook.
- Key structural fields include:
  - Row Number (for original input order)
  - Season (Winter or Summer)
  - Location (Morecambe or Essex)
  - Site (e.g., CS, WS, WP; AH, FW, TM)
  - Habitat (Saltmarsh or Mudflat)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22)
  - Scale (A–D indicating spatial extent)
  - For each species: Percentage cover and, where applicable, a Number field
- Extensive list of species and associated fields (e.g., Agrostis stolonifera, Salicornia europaea, Spartina spp., Puccinellia spp., Trifolium repens, etc.) along with non-typical taxa (nettles, mosses, algae, bare mud, litter, animal droppings, standing dead).

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Documentation
- Calibration procedures: None reported.
- Statistical treatment: None reported.
- Quality control procedures: Not specified in the provided description.
- The dataset provides substantial field metadata (site coordinates, habitat, grazing regime context) to support interpretation and integration with other data layers, but explicit quality control details are not described.

## Potential Uses and Analytical Opportunities
- Compare plant community composition and species cover across soil types (clay vs. sandy) and grazing regimes (high vs. low intensity) at Essex and Morecambe Bay sites.
- Assess seasonal differences in species cover between Winter and Summer 2013.
- Model relationships between environmental context (soil type, inundation frequency, creek structure) and plant community structure.
- Analyze spatial patterns within sites using Quadrat Numbers and Scale categories to explore fine- to broad-scale variability.
- Integrate with ecosystem service considerations by linking species composition to potential services (e.g., habitat provision, carbon sequestration, erosion control) in CBESS context.
