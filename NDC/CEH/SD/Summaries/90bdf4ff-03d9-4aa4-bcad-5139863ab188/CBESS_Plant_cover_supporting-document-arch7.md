# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) percentage cover of plant species on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex.

## Overview
- Dataset records percentage cover of plant species on salt marsh quadrats (1m x 1m).
- Part of CBESS project; aims to support GIS-based visualization of biodiversity and ecosystem services.
- Field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013; staff: Hilary Ford.

## Spatial and temporal scope
- Locations:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH) – 51 47'N, 0 52'E; Fingringhoe Wick (FW) – 51 49'N, 0 58'E; Tillingham Marshes (TM) – 51 41'N, 0 56'E.
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS) – 54 10'N, 3 0'W; Warton Sands (WS) – 54 8'N, 2 48'W.
- Site characteristics:
  - Saltmarsh areas representing two soil types: clay (Essex) and sandy (Morecambe Bay).
  - Regional differences in inundation, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
  - Grazing regimes differ: Essex sites hare-grazed; Morecambe Bay sites sheep-grazed (CS, WS) with winter grazing by pink-footed geese; West Plain lightly grazed.
- Temporal coverage: Winter and Summer seasons, 2013.

## Data structure and content
- Observations:
  - Variable: Plant percentage cover by species per 1m x 1m quadrat.
  - Habitat types: Saltmarsh (SM) and Mudflat (MF).
- Sampling framework:
  - Quadrat numbers: 1 to 22.
  - Scale metadata: A = 1m; B = 1–10m; C = 10–100m; D = 100–upper limit.
  - Seasons: Winter (W), Summer (S).
  - Locations: Morecambe (M) and Essex (E).
  - Site codes: Morecambe – Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP); Essex – Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Dataset format: Excel workbook.
- Species and measurements:
  - Includes listed species (e.g., Agrostis stolonifera, Armeria maritima, Aster tripolium, Salicornia europaea, Spartina species, etc.) with per-quadrat percentage cover values.
  - Additional non-typical saltmarsh observations noted: Urtica dioica (nettle), Moss sp, Bostrychia sp./Cladophora, Algal cover, Bare mud, Litter, Animal droppings, Standing dead, etc.
  - Each species variable described as “Percentage cover of listed species” (and corresponding numeric field).

## Data quality, provenance, and notes
- Calibration procedures: None specified.
- Data checking procedures: None specified.
- Additional notes:
  - Some non-typical saltmarsh species and environmental indicators included with explicit comments.
  - Species and habitat descriptors align with salinity-marsh ecology to support GIS mapping and analysis.

## GIS and visualization considerations
- Spatially explicit: quadrat-level data enables detailed maps across sites, seasons, and scales.
- Multi-resolution capability: data supports visualization at fine (1m) to broader (10–100m) extents via scale codes.
- Rich attribute set: per-quadrat species composition enables species distribution mapping and hotspot analysis.
- Integration potential: coordinates and site metadata facilitate layering with other coastal spatial datasets (inundation, grazing, vegetation types).
