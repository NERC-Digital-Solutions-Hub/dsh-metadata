# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) percentage cover of plant species on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset measuring the percentage cover of plant species in salt marsh sites across Morecambe Bay and Essex.
- Observations are recorded at 1m x 1m quadrats.

## Dataset content
- Observed variable: plant percentage cover for a wide list of species (e.g., Agrostis stolonifera, Aster tripolium, Salicornia europaea, Spartina spp., etc.) and non-typical entries (e.g., Urtica dioica, mosses, algae, bare mud, litter, animal droppings, standing dead).
- Temporal scope: field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013.
- Data format: Excel workbook.
- Primary staff: Hilary Ford.
- Data quality notes: calibration procedures not documented; data checking procedures not documented.

## Locations and site context
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Location coordinates provided for each site.
- Habitat and soil context: Essex sites on clay soils; Morecambe Bay sites on sandy soils; differing inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
- Grazing regimes: Essex sites heavily hare- and Brent goose-grazed; Morecambe Bay sites heavily sheep-grazed with pink-footed geese in winter; West Plain lightly grazed.

## Temporal coverage and sampling
- Monitoring conducted during Winter and Summer 2013 as part of a general field campaign.

## Variables and data structure
- Dataset field descriptions include:
  - Row Number (nominal sort order)
  - Season (Winter W or Summer S)
  - Location (Morecambe M or Essex E)
  - Site (CS, WS, WP, AH, FW, TM)
  - Habitat (Mudflat MF or Saltmarsh SM)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22)
  - Scale (A = 1m; B = 1–10m; C = 10–100m; D = 100–upper limit)
  - Species columns with:
    - Percentage cover (Number)
    - Number (to accompany percentage)
- Species list includes numerous saltmarsh plants (e.g., Agrostis stolonifera, Aster tripolium, Salicornia europaea, Spartina spp.) and non-typical entries (e.g., Urtica dioica, mosses, Bostrychia sp. / Cladophora, algal cover), with some entries marked as not typical saltmarsh species.

## Data quality and notes
- Calibration procedures: None documented.
- Data checking procedures: None documented.
- Some non-typical or unidentified entries noted (e.g., Urtica dioica, mosses) and entries not always identifiable to species level (e.g., standing dead).

## Format and accessibility
- Excel workbook comprising the dataset and a separate "Dataset Field descriptions" sheet detailing the structure and fields.

## Use cases and considerations
- Suitable for analysis of plant community composition across sites and seasons.
- Enables cross-site comparisons of species cover and assessment of biodiversity within CBESS frameworks.
- Useful for exploring habitat-specific plant assemblages and grazing impacts on vegetation structure.
- Limitations to consider: lack of calibration and explicit data quality checks; potential data gaps or patchiness; extensive species list may require careful handling for analysis.
