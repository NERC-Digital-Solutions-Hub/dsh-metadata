# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) percentage cover of plant species on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset capturing percentage cover of plant species on salt marsh sites across Morecambe Bay and Essex.
- Focuses on 1m x 1m quadrats to record how vegetation is distributed within saltmarsh habitats.
- Part of CBESS efforts to understand coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services.

## Data scope and collection
- Variables observed: plant percentage cover for a wide range of species (listed in the dataset), plus non-vegetative cover categories (bare mud, litter, animal droppings, standing dead, etc.).
- Additional fields: row number, season (Winter W or Summer S), location (Morecambe or Essex), site (e.g., CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex), habitat (Mudflat MF or Saltmarsh SM), Quadrat Number (1–22), and scale indicators (A=1m, B=1–10m, C=10–100m, D=100–upper limit).
- Data type: Excel workbook.
- Calibration and formal quality control procedures are not documented (None noted).

## Locations and sampling context
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Spatial coordinates provided for each site, illustrating a coastline with two contrasting soil types and inundation regimes:
  - Essex: predominantly clay soils; hare and Brent goose grazing observed.
  - Morecambe Bay: sandy soils; intensive sheep grazing with winter geese grazing observed; variability in grazing intensity (e.g., West Plain lightly grazed).
- Sampling period: Winter and Summer 2013 as part of a general field campaign.

## Data structure and description
- Species coverage is captured with individual fields for numerous species (examples include Agrostis stolonifera, Armeria maritima, Aster tripolium, Salicornia europaea, Spartina spp., etc.), each recording either a percentage cover or a count where applicable.
- The dataset includes both typical saltmarsh taxa and a small number of non-typical/spurious entries (e.g., Urtica dioica noted as “not typical saltmarsh sp,” various mosses and algae entries).
- Scale metadata allows interpretation of quadrat sampling extent from 1m to larger areas.

## Data quality, metadata, and governance
- Primary contact for data: Hilary Ford.
- Metadata completeness: includes detailed field descriptions, site and habitat classifications, seasonal coding, and quadrat numbering.
- Notable gaps in documentation: no explicit calibration procedures or quality control steps documented.
- Data discoverability considerations: stored as an Excel workbook with extensive field descriptions; no explicit DOIs or repository/collection details provided in the summary.

## Access, reuse, and implications for data strategy
- Format and accessibility: Excel workbook format facilitates reuse but may limit long-term preservation and automated ingestion without standard metadata mapping.
- Reuse potential: rich species-level cover data across two contrasting coastal systems and grazing regimes, useful for:
  - Cross-site comparisons of plant community structure.
  - Temporal analyses across seasons (Winter vs Summer 2013) within saltmarsh habitats.
  - Linking vegetation composition to habitat characteristics, grazing pressure, and inundation regime.
- Data governance considerations for Data Leaders:
  - Ensure metadata standards are maintained and extended (e.g., persistent identifiers, versioning).
  - Consider integrating data into a broader, standardized metadata schema to improve discoverability and interoperability.
  - Assess data quality processes and implement basic QC checks for future updates.
  - Plan for data curation to preserve access to the Excel-based dataset and enable downstream analytics.

## Key implications for data strategy and next steps
- The dataset demonstrates the value of capturing fine-scale vegetation composition across well-documented sites with contrasting environments.
- To strengthen data strategy, augment metadata with persistent identifiers, data lineage, and basic QC documentation.
- Consider broader data sharing and harmonization with other CBESS datasets to reduce fragmentation and improve cross-study analyses.
