# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) percentage cover of plant species on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Measures percentage cover of plant species in 1m x 1m quadrats on salt marsh sites across Essex and Morecambe Bay.
- Part of CBESS-style monitoring to assess coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service sustainability.
- Field campaigns conducted in Winter and Summer 2013.

## Scope and Design
- Focus: plant percentage cover as the primary variable; includes both typical saltmarsh species and some non-typical taxa.
- Data format: Excel workbook with structured rows and many species columns; each row represents quadrat-level observations.

## Locations and Site Details
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM) with geographic coordinates provided.
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP) with geographic coordinates provided.
- Site descriptions: two contrasting soil types (Essex clay vs. Morecambe Bay sandy soils); differences in inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
- Grazing regimes:
  - Essex: hare-grazed sites; heavy grazing by Brent geese at AH and FW.
  - Morecambe Bay: heavy sheep grazing at CS and WS; pink-footed geese grazing in winter; West Plain lightly grazed.

## Data Collection and Structure
- Monitoring cadence: part of a general field campaign in Winter and Summer 2013.
- Observed variable: plant percentage cover per species per quadrat.
- File format: Excel workbook.
- Data structure details (representative fields):
  - Row Number (sorting key)
  - Season (Winter W, Summer S)
  - Location (Morecambe or Essex)
  - Site (CS, WS, WP, AH, FW, TM)
  - Habitat (Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22)
  - Scale (A: 1m; B: 1–10m; C: 10–100m; D: 100–upper limit)
  - Species columns with either Percentage cover or Number (e.g., Agrostis stolonifera, Salicornia europaea, Spartina spp., etc.)
  - Some non-typical or ancillary observations included (e.g., Urtica dioica, mosses, litter, animal droppings)

## Data Quality and Provenance
- Calibration procedures: None indicated.
- Statistical treatment: None indicated.
- Data checking/quality control: Not explicitly detailed in the provided metadata.

## Access, Use, and Metadata
- Dataset field descriptions exist to support data understanding and integration.
- Emphasis on storing datasets and uploading to appropriate portals; aims to enable downstream use and accessibility of underlying data.

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring Analysts
- Provides standardized, quadrat-based biodiversity data across contrasting saltmarsh environments.
- Enables temporal and spatial comparisons of plant community composition and habitat condition.
- Suitable for linking biodiversity data to ecosystem services and policy performance over time.

## Challenges and Opportunities
- Opportunity to increase data value by integrating with additional environmental layers (e.g., grazing intensity, inundation regime, soil properties).
- Need to improve accessibility and documentation of underlying data and quality assurance procedures to facilitate reuse.
