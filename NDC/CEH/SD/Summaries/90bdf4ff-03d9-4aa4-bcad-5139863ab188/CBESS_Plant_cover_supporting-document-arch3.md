# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) percentage cover of plant species on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset records plant species percentage cover on saltmarsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay as part of CBESS monitoring.
- Primary measure: percentage cover of named plant species within 1m x 1m quadrats.
- Collected during Winter and Summer 2013 as part of a general field campaign.
- Aims to inform environmental health monitoring, policy scrutiny, and decision-making; emphasizes detailed metadata to support interpretation and comparability.

## Locations and site context
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Site selection intended to represent contrasting soil types:
  - Essex: clay soils, with hare grazing; heavy grazing by Brent geese at Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick.
  - Morecambe Bay: sandy soils, intensive sheep grazing; pink-footed geese graze in winter; West Plain lightly grazed.
- Regional differences also include inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.

## Sampling design and timing
- Habitat types observed: Saltmarsh and Mudflat (with emphasis on saltmarsh vegetation).
- Quadrat-based sampling: 22 quadrats per site, each 1m x 1m (Scale categories A-D indicating spatial extent from 1m to upper limits).
- Seasons: Winter (W) and Summer (S).
- Observations reflect field campaigns conducted in Winter and Summer 2013.

## Measured variables and species
- Primary variable: percentage cover of listed plant species per quadrat.
- Broad species list includes common saltmarsh taxa (e.g., Agrostis stolonifera, Armeria maritima, Aster tripolium, Atriplex portulacoides, Salicornia europaea, Spartina spp., Saccharina spp. not typical; etc.).
- Additional non-typical or ancillary observations included:
  - Urtica dioica (nettle) - noted as not typical saltmarsh sp.
  - Moss sp, Bostrychia sp. / Cladophora
  - Algal cover, bare mud, litter, animal droppings, standing dead, and other non-plant indicators.
- For each species, fields specify either Percentage cover or Number, enabling both presence/area estimates and counts where applicable.

## Data structure and metadata
- Data are stored in an Excel workbook.
- Key dataset fields (Row Number, Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Quadrat Number, Scale) structure the data and enable cross-site comparability.
- Species columns provide either Percentage cover or Count per quadrat for each listed species.
- Metadata notes:
  - Calibration procedures: None indicated.
  - Data checking procedures: Not specified in the record.
  - Detailed field descriptions accompany the dataset to clarify variable definitions and formats.

## Data provenance and stewardship
- Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
- Data collected during a coordinated field campaign in 2013.
- Location coordinates and site design descriptions are provided to support reproducibility and contextual interpretation.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a high-resolution, species-level vegetation monitoring approach across contrasting saltmarsh habitats and grazing regimes.
- Rich contextual metadata (soil type, inundation, grazing, vegetation context) supports interpretation and policy-relevant analysis.
- Highlights the importance of comprehensive metadata, site-specific context, and clear documentation of measurement formats for monitoring governance and data reuse.
