# Clocaenog_supporting_documentation_Data series.rtf - Supporting documentation SD_Daily_automated_weather_station data_1999to2015_Clocaenog.rtf - Details of data structure

## Overview
- References two related documents: general supporting documentation for a data series and a data-structure description for the SD Daily automated weather station data for Clocaenog (1999–2015).

## What the documents describe
- A daily automated weather station data series covering 1999 through 2015.
- Detailed description of the data structure, including how data fields are organized and defined.

## GIS-relevance and use
- Provides foundational metadata and structure needed to ingest, join, and visualize the weather data in GIS workflows.
- Supports creation of time-enabled map layers and analyses of spatial-temporal weather patterns around Clocaenog.

## Key considerations for implementation
- Review the data-structure details to map each field to GIS attribute schemas (names, units, data types, handling of missing values).
- Confirm spatial context: determine exact station location coordinates if not embedded in the dataset.
- Prepare for data quality checks and data cleaning aligned with the documented structure.

## Recommended next steps
- Obtain and read both referenced documents to understand data fields, units, and constraints.
- Align the weather data schema with your GIS data models and metadata standards.
- Set up validation, provenance tracking, and documentation for end users.
