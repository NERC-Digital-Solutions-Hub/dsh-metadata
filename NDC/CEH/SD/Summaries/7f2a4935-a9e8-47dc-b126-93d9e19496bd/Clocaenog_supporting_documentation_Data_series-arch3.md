# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Purpose and scope
  - Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment in upland moorland (Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales) using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming over the next 20–30 years.
  - Established in 1998; powered by solar and wind; designed for remote operation in sensitive UK upland habitats.
  - Dominant ecosystem: Calluna vulgaris (heather) with additional shrubs and mosses; soil type: humo-ferric podzol.

- Experimental design and treatments
  - Treatments: drought and warming, each with 3 replicated plots; plus 3 control plots, giving 9 plots in total.
  - Drought treatment: annual May–September (1999–2011); since 2012: April–October; reduces annual rainfall by ~20% and excludes ~80% of rain during treatment periods due to a tipping-bucket roof sensor.
  - Warming treatment: retractable aluminum mesh curtains covering plots at night to reduce heat loss; roof retraction triggered by rainfall to protect rainfall, with wind-avoidance (>10 m/s) for curtain safety.
  - Experimental blocks and plot layout described in appendices.

- Data collection: types, methods, and frequency
  - Weather and microclimate
    - AWS meteorological data: daily measurements (1999–present) for temperature, humidity, rainfall, pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind.
    - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily soil and air temperature, soil moisture (1998–present; currently using TDR sensors since 2008).
  - Hydrology and rainfall
    - Storage rain gauge data (site-level rainfall): biweekly collection; serves as robust rainfall baseline.
    - Rainfall chemistry: biweekly samples for pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium.
    - Throughfall data (plot-level rainfall): biweekly; used to compute treatment percent-change and adjust site rainfall to plots.
    - Water table depth: biweekly measurements from 2009 onward via permeable tubes.
  - Soil and ecosystem processes
    - Soil respiration: fortnightly (1999–present) with collars; multiple measurement methods over time including LI-COR and CIRAS systems; automatic measurements from 2013–2014.
    - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): measured with static chambers on same collars (1999–2000, 2007–2009).
    - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): limited years (2002–2004, 2011) using Perspex/Li-Cor systems; adjustments made for biomass differences.
    - Photosynthesis: infrequent measurements (2001–2003) with CIRAS and leaf cuvettes.
  - Vegetation and habitat attributes
    - Vegetation survey (pin-point biomass): annually 1998–2003 and 2007–2012, plus ongoing measurements; conversion of pin hits to biomass using species-specific calibrations.
    - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometry (2001–2004; limited follow-up).
    - Phenology, growth, and pathogens: annual shoot elongation and phenophase data for C. vulgaris, V. myrtillus, E. nigrum (1999–2000, 2002, 2004, and later years).
    - Vegetation chemistry: annual carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates (green and litter).
    - Litterfall: monthly collection 1999–2002; later years less frequent; analyzed for mass and chemistry.
  - Soil and soil biogeochemistry
    - Root biomass: multiple methods and years (2003, 2004; 2008; 2011).
    - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012).
    - Nitrogen mineralisation: multiple years (1998–2004) using paired cores and KCl extracts.
    - SOM/SOC and bulk density: soil cores; depth-separated organic and mineral horizons; conversions to g m-2.
    - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers; biweekly to monthly analyses for NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, pH, NH4.

- Data processing, quality control, and provenance
  - Raw data are converted to standardized flux units (e.g., mg CO2-C m-2 h-1; µmol CO2 m-2 s-1; etc.) with explicit conversion factors.
  - Equipment updates over time and legacy methods: multiple instruments used for soil respiration (CIRAS-2, LICOR 8100, LI-COR automated systems); data processing details described in the supporting documentation.
  - QA practices: data quality checks performed visually in Excel; notes acknowledge that some legacy data may not meet current best-practice standards.
  - Metadata and storage: metadata and some datasets require direct contact with data custodians; not all data are stored in a central data hub (EIDC) yet.
  - Documentation accessibility: datasets and supporting RTF documentation exist; primary contacts for data access are Sabine Reinsch and Bridget Emmett at CEH Bangor.

- Data governance, access, and stewardship considerations
  - On-site data governance and sharing expectations: underlying data should be shared appropriately; some data may have access constraints.
  - Some data are not stored in the CEH data portal (EIDC) and require direct inquiry; ongoing data curation and standardization efforts are implied.
  - Appendix materials provide site layout, quadrat layout, and plot references to support data interpretation and reproducibility.

- Key challenges and considerations for monitoring framework authors
  - Data gaps and accessibility: intermittent data gaps due to equipment issues, theft, weather constraints; some datasets may be incomplete or temporally uneven.
  - Silos and fragmentation: data originate from multiple instruments and methods; integration requires careful metadata management.
  - Metadata quality: some datasets lack complete metadata; ongoing need to ensure provenance and measurement protocols are clear.
  - Data transformation and comparability: throughfall adjustment, unit conversions, and cross-method harmonization required for cross-year analyses.
  - Data governance and openness: balancing publicly shareable data with sensitivities and governance requirements; need for centralized data storage and standardized metadata.
