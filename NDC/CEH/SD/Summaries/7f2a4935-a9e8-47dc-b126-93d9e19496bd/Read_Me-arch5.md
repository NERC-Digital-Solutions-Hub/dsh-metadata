- Overview
  - The provided materials consist of two supporting documents for the Clocaenog data series: general supporting documentation and detailed data-structure information for the SD Daily Automated Weather Station data covering 1999 to 2015.

- Dataset scope
  - Daily observations from the Clocaenog automated weather station, spanning 1999–2015.

- Data structure details (as indicated by the title)
  - Documentation presumably describes how the data are organized, including variable definitions, formats, units, and time-stamping.
  - Likely includes metadata elements such as data provenance, file structure, and data quality indicators to support interpretation and reuse.

- Metadata and governance implications for Data Stewards
  - Enables dataset discoverability and reuse through comprehensive structure documentation.
  - Highlights the need for complete metadata: variable definitions, units, measurement methods, and data quality checks.
  - Supports data-standard alignment and cataloging in data portals.

- Data curation and sharing actions for Data Stewards
  - Review and augment metadata to ensure consistency and interoperability.
  - Ensure clear documentation of data structure for users and future maintainers.
  - Prepare and preserve the dataset for sharing, including versioning and provenance tracking.
  - Consider licensing, access controls, and appropriate use notes when cataloging or publishing.

- Practical considerations for use and upkeep
  - Address potential gaps in metadata or data structure clarity to prevent misinterpretation.
  - Maintain alignment of data formats and units across the entire 1999–2015 span.
  - Facilitate updates and future enhancements by documenting any changes in structure or definitions.
