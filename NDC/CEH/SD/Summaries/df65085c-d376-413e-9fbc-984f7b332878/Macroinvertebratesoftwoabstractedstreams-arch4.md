# Macroinvertebrates of two abstracted streams - taxon data.csv

- Overview
  - Dataset describing species-level macroinvertebrate communities from two abstracted streams in the Lowther catchment, UK, upstream and downstream of abstraction points, with supporting habitat and geographical data.
  - Includes both taxon data (species names and codes) and environmental metadata for contextual analysis.

- Data collection and provenance
  - Sampling dates: 23–24 September 2010.
  - Sampling design: 100 m reaches around abstraction points; five riffles per reach; Surber samples (0.0625 m2) collected to ~5 cm depth; three readings per position for depth and width.
  - Sample handling: field preservation in 4% formaldehyde; lab processing involved washing and identifying macroinvertebrates to lowest possible taxonomic level (usually species).
  - Taxon coding: taxon names and unique taxon codes aligned with Davies, C. & Edwards, F.K. (2011) code list; data entry validated by crosschecking with lab sheets.
  - Sample codes: waterbody (HB Howes Beck or HDB Heltondale Beck), position relative to abstraction (US or DS), replicate number (1–5).

- Data structure and content
  - Taxon dataset columns:
    - Sample identifier
    - Taxon name
    - Taxon code
    - Life stage (L, P, A, U)
    - Abundance per 0.0625 m2
  - Supporting environmental information table includes:
    - Stream name, position (US/DS), grid reference, northings/eastings, altitude, slope, distance from source, altitude of source
    - Geology codes (BGS solid/drift, NCC solid/drift)
    - Wetted width, water depth
    - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA), Habitat Modification Score (HMS), HMS class
  - Streams and context:
    - Howes Beck and Heltondale Beck; US and DS positions; grid references and detailed environmental values provided for each stream location.

- Standards, references, and metadata
  - Habitat and environment data derived using Intelligent River Network (v17); GIS-derived variables referenced to Dawson et al. (2002).
  - RHS (River Habitat Survey) methodology described by Environment Agency (2003).
  - Taxon nomenclature and codes based on Davies & Edwards (2011) code list for recording freshwater macroinvertebrates.
  - Explicit cross-referencing between field, lab, and metadata to ensure traceability.

- Quality assurance and governance
  - Data entry validated by crosschecking lab sheets with printouts.
  - Version control documented (1.0 dated 21/06/2016; 2.0 dated 22/06/2016 to support information); authors credited for various stages (sample collection, laboratory analysis, and supporting information).

- Relevance for Data Leaders
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: clear provenance, standardized taxon coding, structured metadata, and explicit validation.
  - Emphasizes data discoverability and reuse through defined column definitions, sample coding, and linkage between ecological data and environmental descriptors.
  - Highlights collaboration and documentation practices (contributor roles, references, and version history) essential for effective data governance and stewardship.

- Access and usage notes
