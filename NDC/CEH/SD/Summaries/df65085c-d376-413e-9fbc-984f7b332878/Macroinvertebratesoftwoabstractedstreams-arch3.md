# Macroinvertebrates of two abstracted streams - taxon data.csv

## Overview
- Dataset describing macroinvertebrate communities from two abstracted streams in the Lowther catchment, UK, upstream and downstream of abstraction points.
- Includes species-level taxon data and supporting habitat/geographical information.

## Data content
- Macroinvertebrate taxon data:
  - Sample identifier
  - Taxon name (as per Davies and Edwards 2011)
  - Taxon code (as per Davies and Edwards 2011)
  - Life stage (L, P, A, U)
  - Abundance (per 0.0625 m^2 Surber sample)
- Supporting environmental information (Table 1):
  - Stream name, position (US/DS), grid reference, northings/eastings, altitude, slope, distance from source, source height
  - Geology: solid, drift, NCC codes; qualitative classification
  - Wetted width, water depth
  - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) and Habitat Modification Score (HMS) with HMS class

## Study design and sampling
- Waterbodies: Heltondale Beck and Howes Beck (Cawdale Beck), both tributaries of the Lowther, within Eden catchment (Cumbria).
- Sampling dates: 23–24 September 2010.
- Sampling locations: approximately 100 m upstream and downstream of abstraction points; 100 m reach around each location.
- Reach-level measurements: water depth (cm) and wetted width (m) averaged from three readings.
- Habitat assessment: River Habitat Survey (RHS) conducted in the sampling reaches.
- Macroinvertebrate sampling: five riffles sampled per reach using Surber nets (mesh 250 μm, area 0.0625 m^2); depth of sampling ~5 cm; samples preserved in 4% formaldehyde.
- Laboratory processing: organisms identified to lowest taxonomic level possible (usually species); taxon names and codes aligned with Davies & Edwards (2011) code list; data entries validated against laboratory sheets.

## Methodology and data provenance
- Data collection: François Edwards, Peter Scarlett, Gearóid Webb (sampling); Gearóid Webb, François Edwards, Helen Vincent (lab analysis); Peter Scarlett, Gearóid Webb, François Edwards (supporting information).
- Taxonomic reference: Davies, C. and Edwards, F.K. (2011) Code list for recording the macroinvertebrates in freshwater in the British Isles.
- Data validation: cross-checks between data printouts and laboratory sheets.

## Metadata, structure, and accessibility
- Sample codes encode waterbody, position relative to abstraction (US/DS), and replicate (1–5).
- Data architecture supports linking biotic data with environmental/geographic metadata for integrated monitoring.
- Public sharing considerations acknowledged (data governance implications for sharing underlying datasets).

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a full data lifecycle for environmental health monitoring: design, field collection, lab processing, metadata enrichment, quality assurance, and presentation outputs.
- Integrates biological indicators (macroinvertebrates) with habitat assessments (RHS) and geospatial/environmental variables to inform policy decisions and future monitoring.
- Highlights practical challenges common to monitoring programs: data availability, metadata completeness, data standardization, and governance for data sharing.
