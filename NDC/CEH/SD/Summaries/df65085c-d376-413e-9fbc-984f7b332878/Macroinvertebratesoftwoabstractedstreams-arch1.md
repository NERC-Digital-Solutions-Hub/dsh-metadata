# Macroinvertebrates of two abstracted streams - taxon data.csv

## Overview
- Dataset describing macroinvertebrate communities at species level from two abstracted streams in the Lowther catchment, UK, upstream and downstream of abstraction points.
- Includes supporting habitat and geographical data to enable habitat–biota analyses.

## Data content
- Macroinvertebrate taxon dataset:
  - Columns include: sample identifier, taxon name, taxon code, life stage (L, P, A, U), and abundance (per 0.0625 m2 sample area).
  - Taxa identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level; standard taxon codes drawn from Davies and Edwards (2011).
  - Sampling design: five riffles per 100 m reach, with sampling conducted at 20 total samples (two streams × two positions (US/DS) × five replicates).
- Supporting environmental information:
  - Table of per-sample environmental variables including stream name, position relative to abstraction (US/DS), grid references, northings/eastings, altitude, slope, distance from source, height of source, geology codes (solid and drift; BGS and NCC), wetted width, depth, Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA), Habitat Modification Score (HMS), and HMS class.

## Sampling design and methods
- Study streams: Heltondale Beck (HDB) and Howes Beck (HB) in the Lowther catchment; tributaries of the Eden (Cumbria).
- Reach setup: ~100 m upstream and downstream of abstraction points; GPS coordinates recorded; 100 m reach surveyed per sampling point.
- Habitat measurement: River Habitat Survey (RHS) methodology used to assess habitat quality and modifications.
- Macroinvertebrate collection: Surber sampler (250 μm mesh; 0.0625 m2) used to sample five riffles per reach; disturbance to substrate limited to ~5 cm depth; samples preserved in 4% formaldehyde in the field.
- Laboratory processing: samples washed, macroinvertebrates identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (species where feasible); validation against laboratory sheets; taxon nomenclature aligned with Davies & Edwards (2011) code list.
- Sampling date: 23–24 September 2010.
- Sample coding: replicate numbers 1–5; coding indicates waterbody (HB or HDB), position (US or DS), and replicate.

## Variable details (taxon dataset and supporting information)
- Taxon dataset:
  - A: Sample identifier (HB/HDB, US/DS, replicate 1–5)
  - B: Taxon name
  - C: Taxon code
  - D: Life stage (L, P, A, U)
  - E: Abundance in sample (0.0625 m2)
- Supporting information (Table 1) includes:
  - Stream names and positions (US/DS)
  - Grid references, Northings, Eastings
  - Altitude, Slope, Distance from source, Height of source
  - Solid and drift geology codes (BGS; NCC)
  - Wetted width, Depth
  - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA), Habitat Modification Score (HMS), HMS class
  - For each stream, sample-specific data (e.g., US/DS coordinates and environmental values) are provided

## Data quality and provenance
- Data entry validated by cross-checking printouts with laboratory sheets.
- Taxon codes aligned with established list (Davies & Edwards, 2011).
- Methods and metadata reference established guidelines: RHS (Environment Agency) and automated extraction of environmental variables (Dawson et al., 2002).

## Potential analyses for analysts
- Examine relationships between macroinvertebrate community composition and habitat/geomorphology variables (HQA, HMS, depth, width, slope, geology).
- Compare upstream vs downstream of abstraction points and between streams to assess impact of abstraction on taxa richness and abundance.
- Develop predictive models linking environmental variables to species presence/abundance; test with replicate samples.
- Integrate taxon data with supporting environmental information to explore habitat associations and modification effects.

## Limitations and scope
- Temporal scope: single sampling window (23–24 September 2010); limits inference on seasonal dynamics.
- Spatial scope: only two streams within one catchment; results may not generalize broadly.
- Taxonomic resolution: species-level identifications where possible; some life stages or taxa may be less precisely resolved.
