# THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS - taken from Lee A. Walker, Richard F. Shore, Anthony Turk, M. Glo ́ria Pereira and Jennifer Best, The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme: Identifying Chemical Risks to Top Predators in Britain, 2008, Ambio Vol. 37, No. 6, 466-471.

- Purpose and scope
  - PBMS monitors contaminant concentrations principally in liver tissues and in addled or deserted eggs to assess toxicological risks to predatory birds.
  - Matrix choice depends on the compound’s site of toxicological significance and the bird species; rationale varied by contaminant (e.g., SGARs targeted in liver; embryotoxins in eggs).

- Sample sources and collection workflow
  - Sampling relies on the public (advertised submissions), taxidermists, and wildlife rehabilitation centers.
  - Only freeliving birds or those in captivity up to 7 days are used.
  - Submissions are packaged to ADR standards and sent by post; typical annual submissions ≈400 birds.
  - Seasonal pattern: most submissions in autumn (Sept–Oct) and early spring (Feb–Apr), representing about 60% of annual intake.

- Data captured at receipt and postmortem
  - Each bird’s details logged; carcass stored at -20°C.
  - Postmortem data collected: age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, putative cause of death; additional observations include fat reserves, moult, hemorrhaging.
  - Tissues and organs processed: whole organs excised, weighed; tissues archived at -20°C (liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, subcutaneous fat).
  - Eggs handled similarly: measured (length, breadth, weight), date and provenance recorded; contents homogenized and archived; eggshell thickness index calculated (shell weight/length×breadth).

- Core monitoring program and analyses
  - Contaminant analyses conducted on a core subset:
    - Livers from a stratified sample of sparrowhawks; livers of all herons.
    - One egg from each clutch for merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle.
    - ≈10 gannet eggs from Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig; biennial collection at colonies.
    - Livers from a stratified sample of barn owls; livers from all kestrels and red kites.
    - Analyses for PGs: PCBs (congeners, total PCBs, PCB-TEQs), organochlorine insecticides, mercury; SGARs (difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, flocoumafen).
  - Analytical work conducted by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology; methods described in referenced literature.
  - Results published annually (reports and scientific papers) and on the PBMS website; volunteer collectors receive postmortem or biometric data and a summary of contaminant levels.

- Data management, archive, and long-term value
  - Frozen archive contains samples dating back to 1968: ~17,500 tissue samples from 6,000 birds and 9,000 egg contents.
  - Archive serves as a resource for broader environmental toxicology studies and other conservation research; enables piloting and refining new monitoring approaches.
  - Used for nonchemical threat assessments (e.g., illegal trading, genetic studies of populations).

- Outputs, dissemination, and feedback
  - Core outputs include annual PBMS/Wildlife and Pollution reports and dedicated PBMS webpage with data and findings.
  - Feedback loop to volunteers is integral: individual reports or biometric data provided for submitted samples, plus summarized contaminant information when analyses are completed.

- Governance, funding, and collaboration
  - PBMS is funded by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England, Environment Agency, and the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use.
  - Acknowledges and thanks the public volunteers who submit carcasses and samples.

- Implications for data leaders
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: from field collection and metadata capture to laboratory analyses, archiving, and user-facing outputs.
  - Highlights importance of standardized metadata (e.g., EURING codes), robust archiving for long-term reuse, and feedback mechanisms to maintain stakeholder engagement.
  - Illustrates data governance across multiple institutions and funders, with emphasis on data discoverability (web presence) and transparent reporting.
