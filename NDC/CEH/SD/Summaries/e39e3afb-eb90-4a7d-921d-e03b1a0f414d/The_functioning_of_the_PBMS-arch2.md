# THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS

- The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) monitors contaminant concentrations principally in liver tissues and in addled or deserted eggs, selecting the matrix based on the likely toxicological significance for each compound and species.
- Liver is targeted for SGARs (anticoagulant rodenticides) due to their site of action; eggs are used for embryotoxins or when eggs better reflect exposure in rarer species (e.g., golden eagle, merlin) where carcass sampling is limited.

- Sampling sources and eligibility:
  - Relies on the public (advertisements) to collect and send dead predatory birds; taxidermists and wildlife rehabilitation centers also contribute.
  - Only freeliving birds or those in captivity for at most 7 days are used.
  - Approximately 400 birds submitted annually; submissions peak in autumn and early spring (roughly five months account for 60%).
  - Age distribution skewed toward juveniles (approx. 1.8:1 juvenile:adult in recent years).

- Data handling and storage:
  - On receipt, details are logged; carcasses stored at -20°C until undergo postmortem.
  - A macroscopic postmortem determines age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, and putative cause of death; additional observations include fat reserves, moult score, and presence of hemorrhaging.
  - Whole organs excised; tissues (liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, subcutaneous fat) archived at -20°C.

- Egg sampling and data:
  - Eggs are collected only by licensed collectors
