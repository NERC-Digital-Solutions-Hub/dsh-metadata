# THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS

- Purpose and scope
  - The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) tracks contaminant concentrations, primarily in liver tissues and in addled or deserted eggs.
  - Matrix choice depends on the toxicological significance of the compound and the target species.

- Sampling and data collection
  - Submissions come from the public (after advertisements), taxidermists, and wildlife rehabilitation centers; only freeliving birds or those in captivity ≤7 days are used.
  - Approximately 400 birds are submitted annually, with autumn and early spring (Sept–Oct, Feb–Apr) accounting for about 60% of submissions.
  - Eggs are collected only by licensed collectors as part of other nest studies; addled or deserted eggs are submitted.
  - On receipt, carcasses and eggs are logged and stored for further analysis.

- Data captured per specimen
  - Postmortem data include age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, and putative cause of death; common causes are road traffic accidents, other collisions, and starvation.
  - Additional observations include fat reserves, moult score, hemorrhaging; organs are weighed and some tissues archived.

- Data types and metadata
  - Tissues archived: liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, subcutaneous fat (all kept at -20°C).
  - Eggs: measurements (length, breadth, weight), date of collection, provenance, contents, development stage, and shell weight; shell thickness index calculated as shell weight/egg length.
  - Documentation accompanies samples to support provenance and context.

- Archival and storage
  - PBMS maintains a frozen archive dating back to 1968, with ~17,500 tissue samples from 6,000 birds and ~9,000 egg contents; 82% of tissue samples are from 1980 onward.
  - The archive serves as a resource for environmental toxicology studies, methodological pilots, and research on nonchemical threats.

- Analytical program and data quality
  - Core monitoring analyzes selected samples for PCBs (congeners, total PCB TEQs), organochlorine insecticides, and mercury; SGARs are analyzed in liver samples of certain species.
  - Analyses are conducted by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), with established methods described in related publications.
  - Gannet eggs are analyzed biennially; other species’ livers (barn owls, kestrels, red kites) have targeted analyses.

- Outputs and reporting
  - Results are published in annual reports, scientific papers, and on a dedicated PBMS webpage.
  - Volunteers receive postmortem reports or biometric data and, where applicable, a summary of contaminant levels for analyzed samples.

- Data governance, sharing, and stewardship
  - Data provenance is maintained through logging on receipt, sample handling, and analysis; feedback to contributors supports ongoing participation.
  - The PBMS is funded by multiple organizations (CEH, JNCC, Natural England, Environment Agency, Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use) and relies on voluntary submissions from the public.
  - The archive and dataset underpin broader environmental research, including studies beyond core PBMS activities (e.g., genetics, illegal trade, nonchemical threats).

- Stakeholders and engagement
  - Volunteers, taxidermists, wildlife centers, CEH staff, JNCC, natural England, Environment Agency, and rodenticide-use campaigners.
  - Ongoing engagement is reinforced through regular feedback and publicly available results.
