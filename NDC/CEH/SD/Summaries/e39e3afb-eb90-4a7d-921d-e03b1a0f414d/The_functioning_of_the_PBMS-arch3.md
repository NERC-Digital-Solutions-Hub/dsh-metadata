THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS - taken from Lee A. Walker, Richard F. Shore, Anthony Turk, M. Glo ´ria Pereira and Jennifer Best, The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme: Identifying Chemical Risks to Top Predators in Britain, 2008, Ambio Vol. 37, No. 6, 466-471.

## Overview
- The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) monitors contaminant concentrations in predatory birds, using tissue matrices chosen for where toxicological significance is highest (liver for many contaminants; eggs for embryotoxins).
- Matrix selection is species- and compound-specific to capture relevant toxic effects and to accommodate sampling limitations for rare species.

## Sampling and Specimen Sources
- Specimens are collected primarily via public volunteers who submit dead birds, with additional input from taxidermists and wildlife rehabilitation centers.
- Approximately 400 birds are submitted annually; submissions peak in autumn and early spring.
- Juveniles dominate the sample (about 60% in the five most recent years), with an age ratio of roughly 1.8 juveniles to adults.
- Collected carcasses are logged, stored at -20°C, and then subjected to postmortem examination.

## Postmortem Data Collection and Handling
- Postmortems determine age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, and putative cause of death.
- Additional observations include fat reserves, moult score, and presence of hemorrhaging.
- Where possible, whole organs are excised and archived; tissues (liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, subcuta
