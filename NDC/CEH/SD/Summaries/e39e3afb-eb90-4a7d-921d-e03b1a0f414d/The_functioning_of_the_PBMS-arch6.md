# THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS - taken from Lee A. Walker, Richard F. Shore, Anthony Turk, M. Glo ´ria Pereira and Jennifer Best, The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme: Identifying Chemical Risks to Top Predators in Britain, 2008, Ambio Vol. 37, No. 6, 466-471.

- Purpose and scope
  - The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) monitors contaminant concentrations primarily in liver tissues and in addled or deserted eggs, selecting matrices based on the likely toxicological significance for each compound and species.
  - Aims to understand chemical risks to top predators and to study species-specific vulnerabilities, including rare species where eggs may be the feasible monitoring medium.

- Data collection and sample types
  - Sample sources: public volunteers (responding to advertisements), taxidermists, wildlife rehabilitation centers; only freeliving or briefly captive birds are used.
  - Submissions: ~400 birds per year, with peak submissions in autumn and early spring; juveniles predominate (juveniles:adults ~1.8:1).
  - Sample types and measurements:
    - Carcasses: macroscopic postmortem to determine age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, putative cause of death; additional observations include fat reserves, moult scores, and hemorrhaging presence.
    - Organs: whole organs excised and archived (liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, subcutaneous fat) at -20°C.
    - Eggs: only licensed collectors obtain addled or deserted eggs; measurements include length, breadth, weight, contents weight, development stage, and eggshell thickness index; contents are homogenized and archived at -20°C.
  - Sampling rationale: liver analyzed for organochlorine compounds and mercury; eggs analyzed to study embryotoxic contaminants; eggs used for rare species where carcasses are scarce.

- Data management and quality assurance
  - On receipt, bird details are logged; samples stored at -20°C until examination or analysis.
  - Postmortem and egg data are standardized to support comparability across samples and years.
  - Feedback to volunteers (postmortem reports or biometric data for eggs, plus summaries of contaminant levels for analyzed samples) reinforces engagement and data collection quality.

- Core analyses, products, and dissemination
  - Core monitoring program: annual analyses of selected liver and egg samples for:
    - PCBs (35 congeners, totals, and PCB-TEQs)
    - Organochlorine insecticides
    - Mercury
    - SGARs (difвед, brodifacoum, flocoumafen, bromadiolone) in livers (sparrowhawks, barn owls, kestrels, red kites) and/or eggs (for certain species)
  - Analytical partner: Centre for Ecology and Hydrology; methods described in related literature.
  - Outputs: results published in annual reports, scientific papers, and on the PBMS website; outputs also inform broader policy and conservation discussions.
  - Data products for end users: summarized contaminant levels by sample; occasionally early prototypes and dashboards to facilitate interpretation (as part of wider dissemination and ongoing product development).

- Archive, data reuse, and wider research
  - Frozen archive: ~17,500 tissue samples from ~6,000 birds and ~9,000 egg contents, dating back to 1968; 82% of tissue samples from 1980 onwards.
  - Archive value: provides resources for environmental toxicology research, pilot testing of new monitoring methods, and studies beyond core PBMS aims (e.g., illegal trade, genetic structure in golden eagles).
  - Access and secondary use: the archive enables investigations into exposure and effects of chemicals on predatory birds and supports projects addressing nonchemical threats.

- Stakeholders, engagement, and governance
  - Participating partners include the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England, Environment Agency, and the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use.
  - Volunteer involvement is essential; collectors receive regular feedback to sustain engagement.
  - Outputs contribute to policy-relevant knowledge and conservation planning, emphasizing the need for robust data creation and dissemination.

- Challenges and considerations
  - Limited data for some species due to low population densities, requiring eggs as an alternative monitoring matrix when carcasses are insufficient.
  - Data quality depends on effective communication and standardization across diverse data collectors and submissions.
  - Ensuring outputs are widely shared and re-used remains an ongoing objective to maximize data value.

- Key references and accessibility
  - Core findings and methods are detailed in PBMS annual reports, related scientific papers, and on the PBMS website.
  - The PBMS is supported by multiple organizations and thanks the public for their ongoing contributions.
