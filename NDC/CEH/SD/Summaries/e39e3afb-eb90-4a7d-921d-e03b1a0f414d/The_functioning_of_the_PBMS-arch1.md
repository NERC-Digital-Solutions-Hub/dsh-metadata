# THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PBMS - taken from Lee A. Walker, Richard F. Shore, Anthony Turk, M. Glo ´ ria Pereira and Jennifer Best, The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme: Identifying Chemical Risks to Top Predators in Britain, 2008, Ambio Vol. 37, No. 6, 466-471.

## Overview
- Describes the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) and its purpose: identify chemical risks to top predators in Britain by monitoring contaminant concentrations.
- Uses targeted biological matrices (liver and eggs) chosen for their relevance to specific contaminants and species.
- Data are produced through a national collaboration and published in annual reports, scientific papers, and on a dedicated PBMS webpage.
- Feedback to volunteer contributors is a key component of the program.

## Sampling and Specimens
- Sample sources: the public (notably roadkill and found dead birds), taxidermists, and wildlife rehabilitation centers; only freeliving birds or those in captivity ≤7 days are used.
- Submissions: ~400 birds per year; peak submissions in autumn (Sept–Oct) and early spring (Feb–Apr), comprising about 60% of annual submissions.
- Species and age structure: includes predatory birds; age distribution shows juveniles predominate with an age ratio of juveniles:adults ~1.8:1.
- Sample handling: carcasses stored at -20°C until postmortem; all eggs collected from licensed collectors; eggs archived similarly at -20°C.

## Postmortem Examination and Data Collected
- Postmortems determine: age (EURING classification), sex, body weight, putative cause of death, fat reserves, moult score, and presence of hemorrhaging.
- Tissues and samples: whole organs excised when possible; tissues (liver, brain, kidneys, pectoral muscle, subcutaneous fat) archived in glass at -20°C.
- Eggs: measured for length, breadth, weight, date and provenance; contents homogenized and archived; eggshell thickness index calculated as shell weight (mg) / (length × breadth).

## Core Monitoring Program and Analytes
- Core analyses target contaminant groups with sampling outlined as follows:
  - Livers (stratified sample of sparrowhawks) and livers from all herons; contents of one egg per clutch from merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle eggs.
  - ~10 gannet eggs (Bass Rock, Ailsa Craig) analyzed biennially; same contaminants as above.
  - Livers of barn owls and livers of all kestrels and red kites analyzed for four SGARs: difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum, flocoumafen.
  - Contaminants include PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, PCB TEQs), organochlorine insecticides, and mercury.
- Laboratory work: analyses conducted by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology; methods described in cited references.
- Outputs: results published in annual reports and scientific papers; data also posted on the PBMS website.

## Archive, Data Use, and Feedback
- PBMS archive: frozen collection dating back to 1968, with ~17,500 tissue samples from ~6,000 birds and ~9,000 egg contents; 82% of tissue samples dated from 1980 onward.
- Archive value: supports broader environmental toxicology research, pilot testing of new monitoring methods, and studies of nonchemical threats (e.g., illegal wildlife trade, genetic structure studies).
- Feedback mechanism: volunteers receive postmortem reports or biometric data for eggs and summaries of contaminant levels for analyzed samples; essential for maintaining engagement with contributors.

## Accessibility, Collaboration, and Funding
- The PBMS is supported by multiple organizations: Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England, Environment Agency, and the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use.
- Emphasizes collaboration with the public and with research institutions; data and findings are disseminated to inform conservation and policy decisions.
- The program maintains visibility through annual reports, peer‑reviewed papers, and a dedicated webpage for ongoing access to findings.
