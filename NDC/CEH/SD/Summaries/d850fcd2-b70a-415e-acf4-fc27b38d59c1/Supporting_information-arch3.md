# Site description

- Location and site characteristics: long-term alpine research site in Gunnison National Forest, Colorado (38.978725°N, 107.042104°W); southeast-facing ridgeline at ~3540 m above sea level with ~20% slope; substrate includes Mancos shale and quartz monzonite porphyry; surface layer of loose weathered gravel; bedrock 5–10 cm below surface; sparsely vegetated (0–10% cover) during the short summer; snow typically accumulates October–melts June–July; strong west-to-east winds; avalanches rare.

- Plot design: 50 permanent plots, each 2 × 2 m, arranged in a 5 × 10 grid along the ridge axis (40° heading) with 2 × 2 m buffers, covering an 18 × 38 m area.

- Census timing and practice: annual censuses from 2014–2017 (n = 4) conducted when vegetative growth was complete and flowering occurred (late July–early August); every individual located to the nearest centimetre, given a permanent aluminium tag; species identified using RMBL Herbarium vouchers; one seedling unnamed as Indet indet.

- Demographic data collected per individual: size (maximum length and height), recruitment status (seedling vs vegetative/clonal), fecundity (number of mature floral structures), dormancy/death status, and removal of tags if no aboveground growth for >2 consecutive years or seedlings that withered in the same year.

- Microenvironmental data scope: spatial mapping of numerous belowground/aboveground factors (2 m plot corners; 10 cm interpolated grid via ordinary kriging) to capture physiography and disturbance.

- Macroenvironmental data scope: annual climate data (2013–2017) from a nearby weather station 4.5 km away; focus on total precipitation January–July.

- Functional trait data scope: ecological strategy characterization via both belowground and aboveground metrics, collected from individuals near plots to avoid disturbance.

- Data collection logistics: extensive lab and field work to measure root and leaf traits, nutrient and isotopic composition, mycorrhizal colonization, and reproductive parameters; careful sampling to minimize plot disturbance.

- Data summarization framework: integrated analyses across microenvironment, macroenvironment, vital rates, and trait data; use of PCA on standardized variables; kriging-derived environmental grids; realized niche estimation; construction of trait-neighborhood metrics; calculation of crowding, mean trait difference, and mean trait hierarchy for individuals and species; imputation for missing data where needed; careful consideration of scale and radius in neighborhood analyses.
