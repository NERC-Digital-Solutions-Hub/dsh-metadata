# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Esthwaite Water 2014 to 2018

- Purpose and scope
  - Long-term, fortnightly monitoring dataset for Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England (2014–2018).
  - Captures multiple environmental variables to support assessment of ecological health and policy performance over time.

- Variables and units (data available to download)
  - TEMP: Surface temperature, °C
  - OXYG: Surface oxygen saturation, % air-saturation
  - SECC: Secchi depth (water clarity), m
  - ALKA: Alkalinity, µg CaCO3 per L
  - pH: Acidity/alkalinity indicator
  - NH4N: Ammonium, µg N per L
  - NO3N: Nitrate, µg N per L
  - PO4P: Soluble reactive phosphate, µg P per L
  - TOTP: Total phosphorus, µg P per L
  - SIO2: Dissolved reactive silicon, µg SiO2 per L
  - TOCA: Phytoplankton chlorophyll a, µg per L
  - Note: Water samples are integrated from 0 to 5 m; measurements taken from a boat at the deepest lake buoy, or near shore when buoy sampling isn’t possible.

- Data collection regime
  - Fortnightly sampling at Esthwaite Water (2014–2018).
  - Sampling location and method:
    - Primary: buoy at the deepest part of the lake.
    - If inaccessible: samples collected near shore; surface temperature and oxygen still measured.
  - Date range: January 2014 through end of 2018.

- Data format and content
  - Data are provided in CSV format with columns:
    - Date (measurement date)
    - Description (variable name)
    - Value (measurement)
    - Sign (if value < detection limit, shows <)
    - Flag (1 = sample from buoy location; 2 = near shore)
  - Indicates not only measurement values but also detection limits and sampling context.

- Quality control and limitations
  - Current dataset is raw and has not yet undergone quality control or calibration.
  - Data quality is assured through double entry and visual checks.
  - Missing data occur due to weather conditions or staff shortages.

- Data availability and usage
  - Data are described as available to download; measurements are standardized for long-term environmental monitoring.
  - Raw dataset provides a basis for analysis, trend detection, and integration with other environmental data to support broader monitoring initiatives.

- Funding and governance
  - Collected under Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) award NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
