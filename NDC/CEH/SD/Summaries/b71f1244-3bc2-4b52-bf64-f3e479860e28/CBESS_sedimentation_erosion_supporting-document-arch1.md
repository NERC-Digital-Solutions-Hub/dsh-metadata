# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) sedimentation and erosion monitoring over saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

## Overview
- Longitudinal dataset monitoring sedimentation and erosion using surface elevation relative to a rod surface elevation table (rSET) and depths of sediment deposited above feldspar marker horizons adjacent to the rSET benchmark.

## Study Sites and Habitat Types
- Essex, UK
  - Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM)
  - Saltmarsh and mudflat habitats; soils include cohesive clays; different inundation frequencies and vegetation.
- Morecambe Bay, UK
  - Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS)
  - Saltmarsh and mudflat habitats; sandy soils; differing sediment characteristics.

## Monitoring Design and Timeline
- Monitoring period: twice over a 1-year period.
- Installations: autumn 2012.
- Instrumentation: rSET with benchmark rods driven 6–12 m into substrate; receivers attached and top of rod cemented in plastic tubes.
- Marker horizons: 50 cm x 50 cm feldspar horizons installed beyond the instrument arm; depths above horizons measured in cores.

## Measurements and Variables
- Heights measured at 9 pins (Pin 1–9) around the benchmark (four quadrants).
- Marker horizons depth recorded for Core 1–3.
- Additional notes: measurement date/time, SET number (increases landward), and readings per quadrant.

## Data Quality and Handling
- Precision: pin confidence intervals ±4.3 mm.
- Horizon data: if horizon not horizontal, mean depth estimated from three sides; cores with <1 mm sediment above horizon recorded as 0 mm; NA indicates horizon not detectable.
- GPS/Location accuracy: coordinate accuracy better than 50 mm in all directions; OSGB1936 coordinate system.
- Data recording: primarily Excel spreadsheets; some fields NA where not applicable.
- Related dataset: CBESS_gps_wave_transects for GPS coordinates.
