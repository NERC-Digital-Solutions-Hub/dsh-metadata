# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) GPS locations for instruments and features associated with wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table installations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

## Aim and scope
- Provides GPS locations and methodological details for wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table (SET) instruments in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats as part of CBESS.
- Supports inter-comparability and standardized reporting across a global network using Rod Surface Elevation Table (RSET) technology.

## Study sites and habitat contrasts
- Essex, UK: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM) representing saltmarsh with clay soils; mudflat sites with cohesive clays, mud, silt.
- Morecambe Bay, UK: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP) representing saltmarsh with sandy soils; mudflat with coarse, mobile sediments.
- Sites chosen to contrast sediment types, inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.

## Data collection and parameters
- Primary measurements: surface elevation relative to rSET instrument and depths of sediment deposited above feldspar marker horizons (marker horizons ~50 cm × 50 cm).
- Observation cadence: twice over a 1-year monitoring period; measurements taken every 3–6 months at each location.
- Instrumentation: Rod Surface Elevation Table (RSET) with multiple pins and surrounding horizon markers to enable precise elevation change measurements.

## Sampling design and procedures
- Installation: Monitoring stations installed Autumn 2012; RSET setup involves driving benchmark rods deeply into the substrate, attaching receivers, and cementing components in place.
- Observation framework: nine pins per benchmark read in all four quadrants; marker horizons installed just beyond the instrument arm reach; cores taken to measure sediment depth above horizons.
- Core processing: depths measured across cores; if horizon not horizontal, depth averaged from multiple sides; non-detect horizons recorded as 0 mm; NA indicates non-performed measurements.

## Location data and accuracy
- Coordinates for SET benchmarks provided with OSGB1936 reference and accuracy better than 50 mm in all directions.
- Locations listed for multiple benchmarks within each site (e.g., Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe, Tillingham in Essex; Cartmel, Warton in Morecambe Bay), with precise easting, northing, and elevation values.
- GPS locations of benchmarks and marker horizons are included in the associated dataset CBESS_gps_wave_transects.

## Variables and dataset structure
- Dataset fields include: Season, Location (e.g., Morecambe, Essex), Site (e.g., Cartmel Sands, Abbotts Hall), Habitat (Mudflat, Saltmarsh), Quadrat, Scale, Record, Date, Time, SET Number, Pin readings (Pin 1–9), Marker horizon depths (Core 1–3), and Notes.
- Data recording uses Excel spreadsheets; calibration with real-time Leica RTK corrections; standard references for RSET methodology cited (Cahoon et al., 2002).

## Data management and quality
- Data are collected and organized to ensure inter-site comparability and long-term monitoring viability.
- Notes captured alongside readings to document any significant factors affecting measurements.
- Data to be stored and potentially uploaded to appropriate data portals as part of standard monitoring workflows.

## References and documentation
- Rod Surface Elevation Table methodology and calibration referenced to Cahoon et al. (2002) and USGS standard resources.
- Dataset includes links and references for methodology and instrument design, with the CBESS GPS dataset serving as a companion for geolocation data.
