# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) sedimentation and erosion monitoring over saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset documenting sedimentation and erosion monitoring over saltmarsh and mudflat habitats using a rod surface elevation table (rSET) instrument.
  - Measures surface elevation relative to the rSET benchmark and depths of sediment deposited above 50 cm x 50 cm potash feldspar marker horizons adjacent to the benchmark.

- Staff responsible
  - Tom Spencer, Ben Evans

- Observation locations and site descriptions
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM)
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS)
  - Site characteristics: contrasting habitats and sediment types; Essex saltmarsh with clay soils; Morecambe Bay saltmarsh with sandy soils; mudflats in Essex (cohesive clays, mud, silt) vs. Morecambe mudflats with coarse, mobile sediments; differences in inundation frequency, creek structure, and vegetation.

- Monitoring schedule
  - Observations conducted twice over a 1-year monitoring period.

- Variables observed
  - Heights at nine pins (Pin 1–9) and horizon depths at three marker horizons (Core 1–3); accompanying notes and readings.

- Data collection procedures and instrumentation
  - Monitoring stations installed autumn 2012.
  - Rod Surface Elevation Table (RSET) used to enable inter-comparability globally.
  - Benchmarks driven into substrate (6–12 m deep) and receivers mounted; top of rod cemented in plastic tubes around benchmark.
  - Measurements taken every 3–6 months around each benchmark (nine pins in four quadrants).
  - Confidence intervals for individual pins: ±4.3 mm (Cahoon et al. 2002).
  - Marker horizons: 50 cm × 50 cm potash feldspar horizons installed just beyond instrument arm; cores cored contemporaneously; depth of sediment above horizon measured.
  - Data handling: for non-horizontal horizons, mean depth from three sides; <1 mm above horizon recorded as 0 mm; horizons not detectable recorded as NA.
  - Notes on significant factors recorded with readings.

- Geographic coordinates and accuracy
  - Coordinates of SET benchmarks provided; accuracy better than 50 mm in all directions.
  - Coordinate system: OSGB1936 (2)
