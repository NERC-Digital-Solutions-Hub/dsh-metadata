# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) GPS locations for instruments and features associated with wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table installations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

## Overview
- Describes GPS locations for instruments and features related to wave monitoring and rod surface elevation table (rSET) installations.
- Includes surface elevation relative to rSET benchmarks and sediment depth above feldspar marker horizons adjacent to rSET benchmarks.
- Staff responsible: Tom Spencer, Ben Evans.

## Study sites and habitat contrasts
- Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS).
- Habitat contrasts:
  - Saltmarsh: clay soils in Essex; sandy soils in Morecambe Bay.
  - Mudflats: cohesive clays/mud/silt in Essex; coarse, mobile sediments in Morecambe Bay.
- Essex and Morecambe Bay saltmarshes differ in inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.

## Data collected and variables
- Heights at Pin 1–9; horizon depths at Core 1–3.
- Monitoring around rSET benchmarks: measurements taken in nine pins per quadrant across four quadrants.
- Marker horizons: 50 cm × 50 cm feldspar horizons; depth of sediment above horizon measured (mm) for cores 1–3.
- Dataset fields include: Season, Location (Morecambe or Essex), Site, Habitat, Quadrat (1–22), Scale (A: 1 m; B: 1–10 m; C: 10–100 m; D: 100 m+), Record, Date, Time, SET Number, Pin readings (1–9), Marker horizon depths (1–3), and Notes.

## Instruments and procedures
- Monitoring stations installed autumn 2012.
- Rod Surface Elevation Table (rSET) used for standardized measurements; documentation referenced Cahoon et al. (2002).
- SET benchmarks driven into substrate; receivers mounted and cemented in 100 mm drain pipes around benchmarks.
- Measurements every 3–6 months over a 1-year monitoring period; coordinates with Leica GS08 GNSS (accuracy better than 50 mm; OSGB1936).
- Marker horizons installed adjacent to benchmarks; cores used to measure sediment deposition; if horizon not horizontal, depth estimated from multiple sides; non-detectable horizons recorded as NA or 0 mm when less than 1 mm of sediment deposited.

## Data quality, calibration, and metadata
- Pin measurement confidence intervals: ±4.3 mm (Cahoon 2002).
- Notes on significant factors affecting results recorded within spreadsheets.
- Calibration: Leica RTK corrections in real time (two entries).
- Data formats: Excel spreadsheets; NA values indicate non-performed measurements.
- GPS locations for benchmarks and horizons are included in dataset CBESS_gps_wave_transects.

## Locations and coordinate data
- SET benchmarks listed with precise coordinates and elevations (OSGB1936); accuracy better than 50 mm.
- GPS coordinates for benchmarks and horizons are provided in the associated CBESS GPS dataset.

## Data formats and access
- File formats: Excel spreadsheets.
- Dataset fields describe seasonal, spatial, and methodological metadata (season, location, site, habitat, quadrat, scale, date, time, SET number, pin readings, horizon depths, notes).

## References and background
- Cahoon, D.R. et al. 2002. High-Precision Measurements of Wetland Sediment Elevation: II. The Rod Surface Elevation Table. Journal of Sedimentary Research, 72(5): 734-739.
- Calibration and field procedures based on real-time Leica RTK corrections and established SET methodology.

## Potential analytic value for decision-making
- Enables cross-site comparisons of vertical marsh accretion, sediment deposition, and response to inundation regimes.
- Supports modeling of sediment dynamics in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats under varying soil types and hydrodynamic conditions.
- Provides geolocated, standardized time-series data suitable for assessing habitat resilience and informing coastal management decisions.

## Limitations and caveats
- Temporal scope: monitoring conducted twice over a 1-year period; limited long-term trend inference.
- Data gaps: NA entries indicate missing measurements; some fields not recorded or not applicable.
- Spatial scale: while high-resolution at sites, extrapolation to broader regions requires careful scaling and additional data.
