# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity; policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Why locations are confidential:
  - Preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission for future surveys.
  - Confidentiality supports continued capability to inform environmental policy.

- Release conditions and precision levels:
  - Four-digit grid references (identifying a 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing analysis by CEH to avoid release, with exceptions only if the requester demonstrates legal confidentiality/protection of IP data equal to or higher than CS data.
  - Spatial data from within survey squares could potentially identify a square and is therefore treated with the same exceptional conditions as six-digit references.
  - In exceptional cases, licensing may permit external release if needs are proven to require location data and other safeguards are in place.

- Specific licensing conditions:
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
  - End of licensing period requires written confirmation of data destruction.
  - No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
  - Data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit but do not require the higher IP confidentiality threshold; license terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from released data.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, resolves exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences, signed by an authorized senior official.
  - If access is denied, CEH follows FOI/EIR procedures.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - For internal CS partnership use, CEH aims to provide reasonable preprocessing support within moderate demand; other requests handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
