# Countryside Survey in 2007

## Data governance and purpose for Data Stewards
- Documents field methodologies and data collection for Headwaters and Pond Condition surveys within CS2007, spanning 425 headwater squares and identified ponds.
- Supports large-scale, standardized datasets intended for national biodiversity and environmental assessment.

## Data capture and standards
- Uses specialized on-site digital data entry systems to improve data quality and reduce transcription errors:
  - RAPID for River Habitat Survey (RHS) data and River Habitat data entry (RAPID is used for RHS, with validation on-site).
  - IRIS for aquatic plant (MTR-based) survey data.
- Data types collected:
  - Freshwater macroinvertebrate data (RIVPACS) with standardized sampling forms.
  - Hydromorphological and habitat data (RHS/RAPID).
  - Aquatic macrophyte surveys (MTR) with 100 m survey length; species lists and percentage cover.
  - Water quality data (pH, conductivity; SRP, TON, alkalinity from filtered samples).
- Taxonomic references and standard lists:
  - Macrophyte identification using a defined list (351 taxa); emphasis on species-level IDs where possible.
  - Rare species confirmation process with guidance on sampling and submission to experts.

## Data lifecycle and storage
- Field data are centralized through digital systems (RAPID, IRIS) and later consolidated for processing at CEH Dorset.
- Physical samples (macroinvertebrates, plant specimens) are stored in CEH facilities and couriered periodically (typically 6–8 pots per box) with standardized labeling.
- Transport documentation and safety: use of Transport Emergency (TREM) cards; formaldehyde fixatives in sample transport; proper sealing and labeling.

## Metadata and provenance
- Each data entry is linked to core identifiers:
  - CS square number, pond or headwater site code, GPS-derived NGR, date, and surveyor initials.
  - Sample areas and sampling methods (e.g., 500 m headwater reach for RHS, 5–15 m macroinvertebrate sampling area).
- Detailed field sheets and forms provide structured metadata:
  - RIVPACS Sample Area Form for macroinvertebrates.
  - RHS data entered via RAPID with sections for spot-checks, physical attributes, bank/top features, and overall site characteristics.
  - Pond Condition Survey sheets cover water quality, environmental survey, macrophyte survey, drawing/sketches, and pond mapping.

## Data quality, validation, and governance
- On-site validation and data checks:
  - RAPID and IRIS include built-in data validation; staff must complete “Check Data” to ensure completeness before leaving the site.
  - RHS data validation within RAPID to ensure no missing fields and internal consistency.
  - Field survey checklist to ensure all tasks are completed.
- Training and quality assurance:
  - All RHS surveyors hold Environment Agency RHS certification.
  - Teams rotate to maintain consistency; ~7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff.
  - Field survey checklists and sample handling protocols to minimize cross-contamination.
- Data integrity and interoperability:
  - Standardized data fields and drop-down options reduce free-text variance and improve cross-site comparability.
  - Upgrade considerations (RHS 2003 version vs 1997) with comparability maintained in RHS indices.

## Data access, sharing, and archival
- Data and samples are intended for central storage at CEH and Pond Conservation.
- Paper forms and field data are transcribed into digital databases (RAPID, IRIS) and exported to Pond Conservation for processing.
- Monthly courier process to CEH Dorset; clear labeling and tracking of samples and field sheets.
- Documentation and contact points provided for data sharing and sample processing (CEH Dorset, Pond Conservation).

## Data formats and interoperability considerations
- Use of established methods (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR) ensures compatibility with national datasets and prior Countryside Surveys.
- Taxonomic and botanical guidance aligns with national flora references; rare species handling and sample preservation instructions are provided.

## Practical considerations for Data Stewards
- Maintain rigorous metadata discipline: ensure every data point can be traced to square, pond, site, date, and surveyors.
- Enforce standardized labeling and sample tracking to enable reliable data linkage across survey years.
- Plan for data sharing pipelines with Pond Conservation and CEH, including timely dispatch and documentation of analyses.
- Monitor risk factors in data collection (e.g., incomplete RHS sections, missing environmental data) and enforce on-site validation to mitigate gaps.
- Ensure compliance with safety and environmental protocols during fieldwork and sample transport.

## Endnotes and references
- Methods and datasets align with Environment Agency River Habitat Survey guidelines (2003 version) and MTR/macrophyte protocols (Holmes et al. 1999).
- Sampling and identification guidance emphasize accurate species-level data, proper specimen handling, and rare species confirmation processes.
