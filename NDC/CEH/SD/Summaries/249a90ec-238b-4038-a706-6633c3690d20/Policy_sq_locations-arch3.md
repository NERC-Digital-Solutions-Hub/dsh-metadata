# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (Nature Environment Research Council), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why confidentiality matters
- Protects representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys’ scientific integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land.
- Public-interest rationale: confidentiality supports ongoing, reliable environmental policy informing.

## What can be released and at what precision
- Access: can determine whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances under licence; applicant must demonstrate IP/confidentiality constraints at least equal to CS data; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) can, in principle, identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-access terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed at licence end.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; if in doubt, consult CEH.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licence applicants must show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP-protection requirements than six-digit releases; licenses for spatial data/four-digit references prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and the CS partners, makes decisions on exceptional release.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with clauses reflecting policy; licences must be signed by authorised representatives.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI/Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides partners with an annual report detailing access applications and decisions.
- CEH aims to support partner organisations with pre-processing requests within reasonable timeframes; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH may assist as part of collaboration or for payment, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
- Balances utility of spatial CS data for policy monitoring with the need to protect site confidentiality and landowner goodwill.
- Highlights governance requirements: licensing, data security, time-bounded access, and end-of-licence data destruction.
- Encourages data provenance controls and pre-processing to minimize disclosure risk while enabling useful analyses.
- Underlines the importance of clear eligibility, exceptional-access criteria, and ongoing transparency through annual reporting.
