# Countryside Survey 2007

- National GB-scale field survey coordinated by Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (NERC) and Defra partners.
- Focus areas include headwaters (500 m sampling reaches) and ponds, plus integrated macrophyte and macroinvertebrate assessments, hydromorphology, and water chemistry.
- Uses standardized, auditable field protocols with on-site data capture and rigorous quality control.

## Scope and aims

- Re-survey of all CS2000 headwater squares (425) and pond-containing CS2007 squares (629) to assess biological condition and habitat characteristics.
- Headwaters: Macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS), River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology, aquatic plant community (MTR), basic water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity).
- Ponds: Macrophyte survey (MTR), environmental characteristics, water chemistry, plus pond mapping and amenity/land-use data.
- Single, national dataset using consistent methods to enable cross-site comparisons and trend analyses.

## Data collection domains and methods

- Macroinvertebrates (Headwaters)
  - Sampling area: 5–15 m continuous stretch; 3 minutes active kick-sampling plus 1 minute manual search.
  - Equipment: pond nets, sample bottles, fixative (40% formalin), labelled pots.
  - Data capture: RIVPACS Sample Area Form capturing site, date, NGR, method, width, depth, velocity, substrate, habitat types, and photography.
  - Processing: specimens preserved and transported to CEH for RIVPACS analysis; organisms not retained include fish/amphibians and certain rare taxa with live release noted.

- Hydromorphology and environmental data (Headwaters)
  - RHS (River Habitat Survey): 500 m reach centered on macroinvertebrate site; 2003 RHS protocol; field data entered via RAPID.
  - Collected on-site: site morphology, bank modifications, substrate types, vegetation, shade, water clarity, and spot-checks for each transect.
  - Data capture: RHS form entries via RAPID with validation checks; photographs and location data tied to each site.

- Water chemistry (Headwaters)
  - On-site collection of one indicative water sample per watercourse reach.
  - In-field measurements: conductivity and pH (Hanna Combi meter).
  - Filtration for SRP, TON, and alkalinity using 0.45 μm filters; samples labelled with square, date, and habitat type.
  - Sample handling and transport: pre-addressed padded envelopes; all samples tracked with standard labeling.

- Aquatic macrophytes (Headwaters MTR)
  - 100 m reach for macrophyte survey; underwater and emergent/floating vegetation identified to species where possible.
  - Abundance and percent cover recorded on a 9-point scale for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent groups.
  - Photos and careful sampling to ensure reliable identification; specimens sent for laboratory confirmation when necessary.
  - Field methods emphasize systematic, repeatable coverage and careful area estimation.

- Macrophyte data systems (IRIS)
  - IRIS software used to capture aquatic plant data in the field (MS Access).
  - Data entry includes species lists with cover categories, specimen handling for unidentified plants, and on-site data validation.
  - Page-based interface supports species addition, physical site data, and specimen management.

- Pond condition surveys (CS2007)
  - Ponds mapped and identified by mappers; one “survey pond” per square selected for condition assessment.
  - On-site steps: photograph pond, map outline, estimate pond area, draw boundary, assess drawdown, depth measurements, sediment and pond base composition, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows.
  - Hydrological and environmental data: water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity), turbidity, and environmental survey including amenity use and land-use context.
  - Macrophyte survey in 100 m pond length within pond boundary; species list to be recorded with abundance estimates and total submerged/floating/emergent cover.
  - Rare species confirmation procedures and specimen handling guidelines; plant specimens may be sent to Pond Conservation for confirmation.
  - Data capture for ponds includes pond mapping sheets and separate field sheets for water quality, environmental survey, and macrophyte survey.

## Field data capture systems and workflow

- On-site data capture
  - Use of Tablet PC-based systems: RAPID (RHS/Hydromorphology) and IRIS (aquatic plants) to minimize transcription errors and enable real-time validation.
  - Data validation: on-screen checks (Check Data) that enforce completeness and consistency before leaving site.
  - Photos: site photography with marker boards (M for macroinvertebrate, RHS, MTR) to aid relocation and future surveys.

- Data structures and forms
  - RIVPACS Sample Area Form: captures site identity, GPS/NGR, sampling method, time, habitat proportions, substrate types, water width/depth, velocity, and environmental notes.
  - RHS data entry (RAPID): Page-based input with sections for field survey details, valley form, riffles/pools, artificial features, spot-check data, and physical attributes; includes GPS readings and flags for missing data.
  - MTR macrophyte data (MTR form): species list with cover categories and area estimates; separate sections for submerged, floating, emergent plants, and overhangs.
  - IRIS plant data entry: two-page interface for species add, abundance, and site-specific physical data; specimen handling and identifications tracked.
  - Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets: three sheets capturing water quality, environmental survey, and macrophyte survey; detailed fields for boundary delineation, pole measurements, drawdown, substrate, pollution, inflows/outflows, and amenity/land-use data.

- Data governance and QA
  - Field teams: CEH-trained RHS macroinvertebrate samplers; regular team rotations to maintain method consistency.
  - Audits: ~7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff for quality and repeatability.
  - Sample transit and storage: fixed with 40% formaldehyde; samples transported with Transport Emergency Card (TREM) and CEH Dorset processing pipeline; post-survey shipment cadence monthly.

## Deliverables, sharing, and reuse

- Data sharing practices
  - On-site data capture feeds into national databases via RAPID/IRIS; data subsequently integrated into central datasets for analysis (RIVPACS macroinvertebrate assessments; RHS hydromorphology indices; MTR macrophyte status).
  - Samples and plant specimens returned to Pond Conservation and CEH Dorset for processing/confirmation; formal communications (emails) confirm shipment and contents.
  - Field sheets and photos often photocopied or exported to CEH and Pond Conservation; photos may be provided on CD or via email with square/pond identifiers.

- Outputs and products
  - Self-service data products stem from standardized forms, including RIVPACS outputs, RHS indices, and MTR macrophyte community data.
  - Ponds produce rich metadata including boundary delineation, area estimates, drawdown, sediment and base composition, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, land-use context, and amenity assessments.

## Particular challenges and considerations

- Time and data alignment
  - Significant upfront time to “understand the ask” and align data collection with wider team data considerations.
  - Patchy and diverse data types across remote and variable habitats increase coordination needs.

- Data quality and consistency
  - High reliance on standardized forms and on-site validation to minimize transcription errors.
  - Training, audits, and cross-team data checks help ensure comparability across GB squares and survey years.

- Accessibility and safety
  - Field safety considerations for headwater streams and ponds; risk assessment required prior to sampling; guidelines for high/medium risk scenarios.

- Documentation and traceability
  - Detailed labeling, GPS coordinates, and specimen management protocols ensure traceability from field collection to laboratory confirmation and national datasets.

## End-to-end summary

- The CS2007 manual prescribes a unified, field-tested protocol for assessing headwaters and ponds across GB, combining macroinvertebrate (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (RHS), macrophyte (MTR) surveys, and water chemistry into a cohesive data pipeline.
- Data are captured in real-time via Tablet PC systems (RAPID for RHS, IRIS for macrophytes) with on-site validation, ensuring high data quality and immediate availability for aggregation.
- Pond condition assessments extend across mapping, boundary delineation, physical and chemical water parameters, macrophyte communities, and socio-environmental context (land use, amenity value, and disturbances).
- The workflow emphasizes traceability, standardized taxonomy and measurement procedures, and robust QA, enabling nationwide comparability and subsequent data provisioning to conservation partners and laboratories.
