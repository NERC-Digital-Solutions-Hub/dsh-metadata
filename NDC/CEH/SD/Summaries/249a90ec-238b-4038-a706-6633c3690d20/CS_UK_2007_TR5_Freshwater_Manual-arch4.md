# Countryside Survey 2007

- A national freshwater survey across GB, integrating headwater stream and pond assessments to monitor ecological condition and nutrient status.
- Combines multiple scientific methods and data streams to produce a coherent data system for long-term biodiversity and habitat quality monitoring.

## Purpose and scope

- Headwaters: re-survey 425 CS2000 squares; 25 new headwater sampling sites; include macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (RHS), physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
- Ponds: survey 629 CS2007 squares containing ponds; include macrophyte community, pond physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
- Pond condition surveys emphasize drawing boundaries, estimating area, drawdown, sediment/pond base composition, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, and management/land-use context.

## Data systems and tools

- On-site data capture systems:
  - RIVPACS: macroinvertebrate sampling data collection and environmental data (RIVPACS Sample Area Form).
  - RHS (River Habitat Survey): hydromorphological data; field data entered via RAPID on Tablet PC; on-site validation and data checks.
  - MTR/ macrophyte survey: aquatic plant data captured with IRIS in the field; plant identification and cover estimates.
- Data integration:
  - RAPID (RHS field data entry) and IRIS (aquatic plant data entry) feed CEH databases; validation occurs in-field to minimize errors.
  - Data prepared for transfer to CEH Dorset for processing; specimens transported under defined protocols.
- Data quality and governance:
  - Standardised drop-down data entry to reduce free-text errors; on-site validation with iterative corrections.
  - QA measures include trained and certified surveyors, regular team rotations, and approx. 7% site audits by CEH staff.
  - Field survey checklists completed by both surveyors to ensure task completion.

## Design and sampling framework

- Headwaters:
  - 500 m stream reach for macroinvertebrates and RHS; 100 m aquatic plant survey stretch centered on macroinvertebrate site.
  - Sampling aims to cover major habitats proportionally; avoid spates; use standardized 3-minute kick-net sampling plus 1-minute manual search.
  - Environmental data (width, depth, substrate, velocity, etc.) captured for the full sampling area; photographs and sketched relocation aids maintained.
- Ponds:
  - Identify all ponds in square; select survey pond per square; conduct macrophyte and environmental survey, plus water chemistry where possible.
  - Detailed field procedures cover boundary delineation, area estimation, drawdown, sediment/base composition, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, land-use context, and amenity values.

## Data collection, labeling, and workflow

- Field data handling:
  - GPS-based NGR coordinates; exact date, surveyor, and square/pond identifiers recorded on forms.
  - Thorough sample labeling for macroinvertebrates and plants; multiple containers used when needed; formaldehyde fixative used for macroinvertebrate samples.
  - Transport and storage: samples shipped monthly to CEH Dorset; TREM transport card used for hazardous fixatives.
- Data entry workflow:
  - On-site data entry into RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (aquatic plants); validation checks performed before leaving site.
  - Quantity of materials and photographs logged; site environmental data forms accompanied by photographs for relocatability.

## Taxonomy, identification, and rare species

- Aquatic plants:
  - Identification to species level where possible; a 351-taxa list guides field identification and voucher specimen submission.
  - Guidance on when to send samples to labs or experts, with special attention to problematic groups (e.g., Ranunculus, Callitriche, Potamogeton, Charophytes).
  - Rare or legally protected species flagged; confirmation required with caution to minimize disturbance.
- Macroinvertebrates:
  - Standardized macroinvertebrate sampling and labeling practices to ensure comparability with historical CS2000/CS1990 methods.
- Data consistency:
  - Taxonomic standards aligned with national references, with explicit procedures for submitting unidentified material and vouchers.

## Outputs, accessibility, and use

- Data intended to feed national biodiversity and hydromorphology indices (RHS/RIVPACS/MTR outputs) and support cross-year comparability (CS2000, CS2007, and future cycles).
- On-site data validation via RAPID/IRIS improves data quality before database loading and downstream analyses.
- Data and sample handling workflows ensure traceability from field collection to CEH processing and long-term storage.

## Challenges and considerations

- Operational constraints:
  - Large field logistics, safety considerations in water/ponds, and accessibility across diverse habitats.
  - Weather and hydrological conditions (e.g., spates) can affect sampling consistency.
- Data integration:
  - Coordinating multiple data systems (RIVPACS, RHS via RAPID, MTR via IRIS) for a unified national dataset.
  - Maintaining data quality across teams with regular audits and training.
- Change management:
  - Transition to 2003 RHS protocol for comparability; training and accreditation required for all surveyors.
