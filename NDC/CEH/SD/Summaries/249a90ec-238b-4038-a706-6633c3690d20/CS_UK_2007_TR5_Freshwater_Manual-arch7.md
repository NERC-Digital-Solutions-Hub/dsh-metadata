# HEADWATERS

- Purpose and scope
  - Countryside Survey 2007 headwater component across GB.
  - Re-survey 425 CS2000 squares for headwater streams; 25 selected squares include a new headwater sampling site.
  - For headwaters, re-survey macroinvertebrate community, hydromorphological characteristics (River Habitat Survey, RHS), physical characteristics, and water chemistry; 25 squares with new headwater sites; 500 m RHS reach per site; plant survey within the RHS context.

- Core components and methods
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS): single continuous 5–15 m stream-bed sampling area; 3 minutes active sampling with pond-net plus 1 minute manual search; proportional habitat sampling; fixation with formalin; on-site data capture using RIVPACS forms.
  - Hydromorphological survey (River Habitat Survey, RHS): 500 m reach centered on macroinvertebrate site; RHS data captured in field via RAPID; 2003 RHS protocol adopted; 17-section RHS data structure; on-site validation in RAPID.
  - Aquatic plant survey (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR): 100 m reach centered on macroinvertebrate site; walk and record macrophyte species and percent cover; use pressed/preserved specimens for difficult IDs; specimen handling and lab confirmation guidelines included.
  - Water chemistry: indicative sample at each headwater site; measure pH and conductivity in field; filter 50 ml samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity; on-site filtration using 0.45 μm syring filters; detailed sample labeling and submission protocol.

- Data capture and digital tools
  - RAPID: field digital data entry system for RHS data; 500 m RHS field data captured; 17 sections across 4 pages; built-in validation (Check Data) before leaving site.
  - IRIS: aquatic plant data entry and management in the field; two-page form for plant data and site characteristics; includes specimen labeling and handling instructions; on-site validation before leaving.
  - Field survey checklists: combined A–D task checklist to ensure all components completed before departure.

- Sampling planning and site workflow
  - All 425 CS2000 squares to be re-surveyed for headwaters; 25 squares include new headwater sites to optimize sampling focus on headwater streams.
  - Headwater sampling site layout: sampling point for macroinvertebrates and chemistry positioned to maximize RHS and habitat sampling within a 500 m stretch; photographs and mapping required for relocation.

- Data quality and training
  - GE/CEH-led quality control: Environment Agency RHS accreditation held by surveyors; training in RIVPACS macroinvertebrate methods, MTR aquatic plant surveying, and chemical sampling.
  - Regular team rotation for consistency; ~7% of headwater sites audited in the field; on-site validation to minimize data transfer errors.

- Health and safety
  - Safety considerations across sampling in streams: access, water conditions, riverbed stability, livestock, and obstacles; high-risk situations may require postponement.

- Pond Condition Survey (overview and workflow)
  - Identification and mapping of ponds within each CS square by mappers; define a survey pond per square (25 m2 to 2 ha, typically water present for ≥4 months).
  - Steps for pond assessment:
    - Obtain mapped pond, identify survey pond, photograph with square reference, sketch outline, and estimate pond area.
    - Environmental assessment: record inflows/outflows, turbidity, water chemistry, and physical attributes; document surrounding land use and amenity value.
    - Macrophyte survey: full pond boundary, species list, and abundance (dominant to rare); specimen collection and lab confirmation guidelines; record submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent categories and overhang shading.
    - Data sheets: pond condition survey sheets, pond mapping sheets, and macrophyte recording sheets; packing, labeling, and transit procedures described (including TREM transport card for fixatives).
  - Data submission and turnaround: samples stored at CEH base until enough to courier to CEH Dorset; plant specimens sent for ID confirmation; monthly dispatch target.

- Equipment and logistics
  - Comprehensive field equipment and safety gear listed for both headwaters and pond surveys (nets, calipers, GPS, maps, PPE, labeling materials, fixatives, sampling pots, transport boxes, TREM cards, etc.).
  - Transport and sample handling: samples shipped in secure boxes to CEH Dorset; detailed labeling and documentation required to ensure traceability.

- Documentation and references
  - Core reference frameworks: River Habitat Survey (Environment Agency, 2003), RIVPACS macroinvertebrate methodology (Murray-Bligh et al., 1999; Holmes et al., 1999), MTR macrophyte survey protocol (Holmes et al., 1999; Stewart 2004).
  - Field forms and data schemas integrated into digital systems (RAPID for RHS, IRIS for aquatic plants, and specialized RIVPACS forms).

- End-of-survey and QA
  - Field survey check-lists completed by both surveyors together to ensure all tasks are completed.
  - Final data validation on-site via RAPID/IRIS checks before leaving the site.
  - Post-field QA includes auditing a subset of headwater sites and ensuring proper sample handling and transport.

  - Guidance and training materials linked to Environment Agency RHS manual, MTR protocols, and CEH support channels; project office contact details provided for sample submission and coordination.
