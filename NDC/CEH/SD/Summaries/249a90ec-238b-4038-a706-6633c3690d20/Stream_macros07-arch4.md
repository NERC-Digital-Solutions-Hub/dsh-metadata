# Headwater stream macrophyte data 2007 [Countryside Survey] Dataset description

## Overview
- Dataset describing headwater stream macrophytes from the Countryside Survey 2007.
- Collected using the standard Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) protocol to record presence and extent of macrophytes in a 100 m stream reach; an extended plant species checklist was used beyond typical MTR requirements.
- Data captured on tablet computers with custom software.

## Data collection methods
- Survey design follows the MTR protocol (Holmes et al. 1999).
- Focused on 100 m reach with records of occurrence and abundance (on a categorical scale) for macrophyte species.
- More extensive plant species checklist than standard MTR; data recorded digitally on tablets.
