# Headwater stream macrophyte data 2007 [Countryside Survey] Dataset description

## Overview
- This dataset describes headwater stream macrophytes from the Countryside Survey 2007.
- Collected under the Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) protocol, with an expanded plant species checklist beyond typical MTR needs.
- Data was recorded for 100 m stream reaches, using tablet computers and custom software.

## Data Collection and Methods
- Survey method: Standard MTR protocol (Holmes et al. 1999) to record presence and extent of macrophytes in a 100 m reach.
- Expanded species checklist used to capture additional plant information.
- Data capture: Occurrence and abundance recorded on tablets with custom software.
