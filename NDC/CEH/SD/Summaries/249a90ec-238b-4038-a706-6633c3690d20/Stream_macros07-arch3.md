# Headwater stream macrophyte data 2007 [Countryside Survey] Dataset description

## Overview
- Describes the Headwater streams macrophyte dataset from the Countryside Survey 2007.
- Data collected under the Countryside Survey program, © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Primary data use documented in related reports and manuals (see further information).

## Data collection methods
- Macrophytes surveyed using the standard Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) protocol, recording presence and extent of macrophytes in a 100 m stream reach.
- A more extensive plant species checklist was used than required for typical MTR purposes.
- Occurrence and abundance recorded on tablet computers using custom software.

## Dataset contents
- Table: STREAM_MACROPHYTES_07.csv
- Key fields:
  - SQUARE: 1 km square sampling site code
  - YEAR: Year of Survey
  - SITE_ID: Site identifier within the 1 km square
  - SURVEY_DATE: Date of survey
  - PLANT_NAME: Scientific name of plant
  - PROPORTION: Proportion (%) of the 100 m stretch covered by the plant
  - LC07: Land class 2007 (text)
  - LC07_NUM: Land class 2007 (numeric code)
  - EZ_DESC_07: Environmental zone description
  - COUNTY07: County (England & Wales) or Council (Scotland)
  - COUNTRY: England (Eng), Scotland (Sco) or Wales (Wal)

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates use of a standardized protocol (MTR) to enable comparability across sites and years.
- Highlights the value of an expanded species checklist alongside standard metrics.
- Emphasizes the importance of structured metadata (e.g., LC07, EZ_DESC_07, COUNTY07, COUNTRY) for data integration and reuse.
- Shows data collection via tablets with custom software to improve data capture and quality control.
- Underlines need for clear data acknowledgement and adherence to copyright and data rights.
