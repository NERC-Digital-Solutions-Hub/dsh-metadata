# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Policy specifically targets survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

## Current CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future survey access.
- Public-interest rationale supports confidentiality; requests handled under UK FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When locations may be released
- Four-digit grid references (to identify 10x10 km grid squares) can be released under licence for predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references require extremely exceptional circumstances and CEH-preprocessed analysis to avoid releasing precise locations; rarely approved, with stringent terms.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) can be used to infer square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release (licence terms)
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- At licence end, organisations must confirm destruction of location data in writing.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit but do not require the same IP confidentiality level.
- Licences include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise square locations from the data or to claim such achievement.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decisions with rationale.
- CEH aims to process internal pre-processing needs within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case handling for external organisations.
- Partners are advised to consult with CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH may assist in defining requirements or support use, potentially for collaboration or payment.
