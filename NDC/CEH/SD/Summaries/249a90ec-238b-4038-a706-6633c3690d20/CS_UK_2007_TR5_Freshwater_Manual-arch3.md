# Countryside Survey 2007 Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey

## Purpose and Scope
- Provides environmental health monitoring frameworks for policy scrutiny and decision-making.
- Focuses on headwaters and ponds within GB, integrating macroinvertebrate, hydromorphological, macrophyte, and water chemistry data.
- Aims to deliver standardized measures across multiple ecological domains to inform policy and future actions.

## Key Monitoring Measures and Data Types
- Headwaters (CS2007) elements (for all 425 CS2000 squares):
  - Macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS method) and related environmental variables.
  - Hydromorphological status of the watercourse (River Habitat Survey, RHS).
  - Aquatic plant community (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR, method).
  - Physical characteristics of the watercourse.
  - Water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity).
- Ponds (CS2007): randomly selected pond in each square with ponds (629 CS2007 squares):
  - Aquatic plant community.
  - Physical characteristics of the waterbody.
  - Water chemistry.
- Outputs and data products are designed for integration and comparison with CS2000 baselines and across survey cycles.

## Data Collection Methods and Protocols
- Headwaters sampling
  - 500 m stream stretch for RHS and macroinvertebrate sampling; fish, amphibians not targeted.
  - 100 m aquatic plant survey stretch centered on macroinvertebrate sampling point.
  - Randomly selected 25 squares are replaced with new headwater sites to optimize focus on headwaters.
- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
  - Three-minute kick-net sampling plus one minute of manual searching.
  - Sampling area is a single continuous habitat area; proportional sampling across habitats.
  - Sample handling includes immediate preservation with formalin, labeling, and on-site environmental data capture.
  - Use of standard pond-net and routine net maintenance to avoid contamination.
- Environmental data collection (RIVPACS Form)
  - Measurements include river width, depth at specified transect points, surface velocity, and substrate in full sampling width.
  - Recording of substratum types, habitat types (Pool, Run, Riffle, Slack), channel shading, and water clarity.
  - Photographs with site boards for relocation; sketch map of sampling area.
- Water chemistry sampling
  - Field measurements of conductivity and pH (on-site with Hanna meter).
  - Filtered samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity using 0.45 µm filters; labeling and shipment to CEH labs.
  - Standardized bottle handling, filtering procedures, and sample documentation.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS) data entry
  - Digital data entry via RAPID (Tablet PC) with 17 sections across 4 pages; on-site validation and data checks.
  - RHS training and accreditation required; field guidance references 2003 RHS protocol.
- Aquatic plant survey (MTR)
  - 100 m reach survey length; walk/wade through channel to record macrophyte species presence and percent cover on a 9-point scale.
  - Specimens collected for lab confirmation when necessary; rare species require careful handling and potential expert confirmation.
  - Data captured in IRIS (field data system) with validation checks.
- Field and data governance
  - On-site validation (RAPID/IRIS) to ensure completeness and consistency before leaving site.
  - Regular QA: EA RHS certification, RIVPACS/MTR training, periodic audits (~7%), field team rotations, and field survey checklists.
  - Data and samples stored at CEH bases; monthly courier dispatch to CEH Dorset for macroinvertebrates and plant specimens; TREM cards used for transport safety.

## Pond Condition Survey Protocols (CS2007)
- Pond identification and mapping
  - Mapping and recording basic pond attributes; identify one survey pond per square meeting CS2007 definition (25 m² to 2 ha; typically holds water for at least four months/year).
  - Pond boundary, area estimation, drawdown height, and proportion of water area documented.
- Water quality and turbidity
  - If feasible, turbidity estimated in situ; conduct conductivity and pH measurements; take filtered SRP/TON/alkalinity samples.
  - On-site sample labeling and secure transport to CEH laboratories.
- Macrophyte survey
  - Macrophyte survey of outer pond boundary for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species within the pond 100 m boundary.
  - Identification to species where possible; sampling and lab confirmation for difficult taxa; rare species flagged for expert confirmation.
  - Abundance estimates and percent cover recorded for each species; percentages added to total cover data (submerged, floating, emergent) and overhang.
- Habitat and land-use data
  - Recording of surrounding land use within 0–5 m and 0–100 m zones.
  - Assessment of pond amenities, public rights of way visibility, public access, and amenity use.
- Pollution and inflows/outflows
  - Document pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, and flow rates where observable.
  - Record pond management practices, livestock grazing, waterbird and fish presence, amphibians, and surrounding land use.
- Documentation and specimen handling
  - Photograph pond with square number; sketch boundary; label and preserve plant specimens (pressed, picked, or alcohol-preserved as appropriate).
  - Samples and field sheets dispatched to Pond Conservation; use standardized labeling and storage protocols.
- Data and quality controls
  - Ponds integrated with headwater surveys; standard field and lab QA; field survey checklist used to ensure task completion.

## Data Governance, Metadata and Data Management
- Digital data capture (RAPID for RHS; IRIS for aquatic plants) to minimize transcription errors and improve data quality on-site.
- Mandatory on-site data validation before leaving the site; iterative error-checking until data appear complete.
- Harmonization with CS2000 methods to enable longitudinal comparison and trend analysis.
- Clear labeling, version control, and traceability for samples and field data; prescribed handling, transport, and storage.

## Challenges and Considerations for Monitoring Framework Authors
- Data gaps and lack of timely access to data across organisations.
- Organizational silos hindering data sharing and integration.
- Barriers to publicly sharing datasets due to metadata and privacy concerns.
- Metadata inadequacy complicating verification of data adequacy.
- Data formatting and transformation requirements to integrate diverse data streams.
- Communicating complex, multi-domain findings clearly to policymakers.
- Implementing data governance to ensure datasets meet standards and remain up-to-date.

## Implications for Policy and Practice
- Provides a structured, repeatable framework for assessing environmental health across headwaters and ponds in GB.
- Enables integration of biological (macroinvertebrates, macrophytes) and physical-chemical indicators with habitat and land-use context.
- Supports evidence-based decision-making, monitoring of trends, and assessment of policy outcomes related to freshwater ecosystems.
- Demonstrates the value of digital data capture, standardized protocols, and governance to ensure data quality and accessibility for policy analysis.

## Conclusion and Key Takeaways for Monitoring Framework Authors
- The Countryside Survey 2007 manual presents a comprehensive, multi-domain monitoring framework combining RIVPACS, RHS, MTR, and pond surveys.
- It emphasizes standardized methods, on-site data validation, and robust QA to produce policy-relevant environmental health indicators.
- The document highlights the importance of metadata, data sharing, and governance to overcome barriers and enable effective monitoring for policy evaluation and future planning.
