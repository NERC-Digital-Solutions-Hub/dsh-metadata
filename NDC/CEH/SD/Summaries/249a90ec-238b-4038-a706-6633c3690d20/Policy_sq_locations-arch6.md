# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: Maximise the public benefit and utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations. The policy covers survey square location data and spatial data within squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

- Partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH) on behalf of NERC; Defra; Natural England; Welsh Government; Scottish Government; NIEA; Forestry Commission; Countryside Council for Wales; Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Why locations are confidential:
  - Protects representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveying.
  - Supported by public-interest rationale; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- When locations may be released and at what precision:
  - Four-digit grid references (identifies 10x10 km grid square) can be released under licence to show approximate locations.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise) are generally avoided; only if CEH can perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing locations.
  - Very exceptional circumstances: explicit demonstration that the external use has equal/higher IP confidentiality than CS data; in such cases location information may be released externally under licence.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, etc.) can potentially identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-terms conditions as six-digit references.

- Specific conditions of release:
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained afterward.
  - Licensee must confirm in writing that data remained secure and has been destroyed after the licence ends.
  - No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP) if requested.
  - Four-digit releases have licence terms similar to six-digit releases but without the higher IP-confidentiality requirements; a clause prevents attempts to deduce precise square locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences signed by an authorised senior official.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe for CS partnership use; external requests are handled case-by-case.
  - Prospective licensees are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use any data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may vary (collaborative effort or paid support).
