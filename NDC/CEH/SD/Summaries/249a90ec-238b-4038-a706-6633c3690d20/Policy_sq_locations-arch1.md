# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey site locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- Current CS partners:
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - The Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Why locations are confidential:
  - To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill
  - Essential for future scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permission for surveys
  - Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations

- Circumstances for release and precision:
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to show which grid squares contain CS squares
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing analysis by CEH; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may external release occur under licence
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry confidentiality; released only under same exceptional terms as six-digit references

- Conditions of release:
  - Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need
  - Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed after licensing period and written confirmation provided
  - No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations
  - Location data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance
  - If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP
  - Four-digit releases have fewer IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; four-digit data cannot be used to deduce precise square locations

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences with clauses reflecting policy; signed by authorized representatives of licensee organisations
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports decisions under Act and Regulations
  - CEH provides an annual report on release applications and decision grounds
  - CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand
  - For non-CS partner organisations, requests are case-by-case
  - Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH may assist as a scientific lead or on a collaborative or paid basis
