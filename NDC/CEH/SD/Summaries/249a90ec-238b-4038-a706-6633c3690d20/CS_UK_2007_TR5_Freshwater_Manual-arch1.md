# HEADWATERS

- Purpose and scope
  - Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) headwater component: re-survey of headwaters across GB to assess macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, hydromorphology, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - All 425 CS2000 squares are re-surveyed for headwaters; 25 squares include a new headwater sampling site to focus on headwater streams.
  - A River Habitat Survey (RHS) and RIVPACS macroinvertebrate assessment are central; aquatic macrophyte surveys (MTR) and water chemistry sampling accompany macroinvertebrate data.
  - The RHS section will be 500 m long; the aquatic plant survey (MTR) covers a 100 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate site.

- Survey design and data collection targets
  - Headwaters: in 425 squares, sample macroinvertebrate community, RHS hydromorphological characteristics, physical characteristics, and a 100 m aquatic plant survey; take a single indicative water chemistry sample per site.
  - Ponds within CS2007 squares: in 629 CS2007 squares containing ponds, randomly select a pond per square for condition assessment (macrophyte community, physical characteristics, water chemistry, and environmental survey data).
  - Spatial arrangement and relocation: sampling locations chosen to maximize habitat representation and ease future relocation; nested sampling stretches (500 m for streams, 100 m for macrophytes) centered on macroinvertebrate sampling points.

- Data collection methods and systems
  - Macroinvertebrates (RIVPACS-based): standardized 3-minute kick-net sampling plus 1-minute manual search; habitats sampled in proportion to their cover; samples fixed with formalin and stored for lab analysis; relocateable sampling area documented on RIVPACS forms.
  - Hydromorphology and environment: RHS data collected in the field; uses 2003 RHS protocol; data entered in the RAPID field system on a Tablet PC; on-site validation to ensure data quality.
  - Aquatic plants (MTR): 100 m macrophyte survey, recording presence and cover of submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species; specimen collection and laboratory confirmation for difficult taxa; plant identifications guided by a standard taxonomic list; data entered in IRIS (field data entry system) on a Tablet PC.
  - Water chemistry: field measurements of conductivity and pH; on-site filtration for SRP, TON, and alkalinity using 0.45 μm filters; sample labeling and transport to CEH laboratories.
  - Data management: on-site data validation via RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (plant survey); field survey checklists completed; data subsequently uploaded to central databases.

- Pond condition survey (CS2007)
  - Mapping and pond identification: ponds in each square identified and described on the CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet; the survey pond is selected for detailed macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry assessment.
  - Survey steps and measurements: photograph the pond; delineate outer boundary; sketch pond and estimate area; measure drawdown height; estimate current water coverage; assess sediment and pond base composition; identify inflows/outflows and their flows; assess pollution indicators (dumped waste, road runoff, other pollutants); document surrounding land use and amenity values.
  - Macrophyte survey: full pond boundary surveyed for wetland plants; species identified to as-close-to-species level as possible; abundance recorded as a percentage cover; samples collected for difficult taxa (e.g., Ranunculus, Potamogeton) and identification confirmed later; rare or legally protected species treated with caution and, if necessary, confirmation or photographs used for verification.
  - Data handling and labels: specimens labeled with CS square and pond codes; pressed or preserved according to guidelines; specimens sent to Pond Conservation; field sheets stapled and archived; transport procedures outlined (TREM card, CEH Dorset processing).
  - Documentation and QA: pond condition forms, mapping sheets, and plant data sheets compiled; quality control includes training, team rotation, audits, and field checklists; data submitted monthly to CEH Pond Conservation.

- Documentation, lab handling, and safety
  - Transport and storage: macroinvertebrate and plant samples boxed with TREM card; shipment to CEH Dorset as soon as a batch of 6–8 pots is ready.
  - Safety and health: standard field safety for water sampling and wading; pond-specific hazards highlighted (emergent plant mats, unstable bases, deep silt); two-person surveying recommended for ponds.
  - Quality control: formal training and accreditation for RHS, macroinvertebrate sampling, and MTR plant surveying; regular data audits; on-site validation before leaving survey sites.

- Key procedures and outputs
  - In-the-field data capture: RHS via RAPID; aquatic plants via IRIS; macroinvertebrates and water chemistry via standardized forms and lab workflows.
  - Data outputs: species lists and abundances for macroinvertebrates and macrophytes; environmental and habitat data (width, depth, substratum, bank features, vegetation, shading, water clarity); chemical measurements (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity).
  - Analytical framework: integration of RIVPACS (bioassessment), RHS hydromorphology indices, and MTR macrophyte-based trophic indicators to assess condition and potential drivers of change.

- Summary of intended outcomes
  - Produce nationally comparable, standardized data across GB headwaters and ponds to identify ecological condition, hydromorphological context, and nutrient status, enabling correlations, patterns, and predictive insights for management and policy decisions.
