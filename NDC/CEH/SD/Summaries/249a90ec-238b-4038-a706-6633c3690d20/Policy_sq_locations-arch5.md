# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Sets policy to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners include CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Preserve scientific integrity of the sampling and future permission to survey land.
  - Public interest rationale; requests handled under UK FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- When and how locations may be released (precision and licensing)
  - approximate locations: four-digit grid references can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing a square.
  - precise locations (six-digit grid references): released only if necessary and after CEH pre-processing to avoid release; very exceptional circumstances may allow external release if IP/confidentiality is equally or more protected than CS data.
  - spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality risks and require the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
  - four-digit releases do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases, but still subject to licence terms.

- Licensing terms and restrictions
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, stored securely, and accessible only to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
  - Licences are finite, project-specific; data must not be retained for other purposes.
  - End of licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
  - No data or derived information may be shared with third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - For four-digit releases, IP/confidentiality criteria are less stringent than for six-digit releases; users must not attempt to deduce precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with approved terms.
  - Licences must be signed by a senior person authorized to bind the licensee organization.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing analysis support within moderate demand; external requests are case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

- Practical guidance for data stewards
  - Treat survey square location data as sensitive; manage access via licensed, time-bound arrangements.
  - Document decision rationale for releases and maintain an auditable trail.
  - Ensure secure data handling, storage, and destruction procedures are in place for licensed data.
  - Coordinate with CEH for pre-processing or processing needs to avoid unnecessary data release.
  - Communicate visibility of policy and licensing requirements to data users and creators.
