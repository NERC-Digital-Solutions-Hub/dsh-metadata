# HEADWATERS

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of Countryside Survey 2007; aims to monitor freshwater health across GB using consistent data formats.
  - Headwater streams and ponds will be surveyed to assess biological condition and hydromorphology over time.

- Survey design and scope
  - Re-survey of all 425 CS2000 squares for headwater streams.
  - For each square: macroinvertebrate community, hydromorphological status (River Habitat Survey), aquatic plant community, water chemistry.
  - In CS2007 squares containing ponds: randomly selected pond surveyed for aquatic plants, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - 25 headwater sampling sites (new) chosen within 425 CS2007 squares to focus on suitable headwater streams.
  - The Countryside Survey is the only national freshwater survey with potential to cover multiple water body types across GB.

- Key elements and sequence of headwater sampling
  - Headwater sampling site within each CS2000 square spans 500 m of watercourse; aquatic plant survey covers a 100 m central stretch.
  - For 25 CS2007 headwaters: sample a different smaller watercourse site to replace CS2000 site if needed.
  - Photographs required for macroinvertebrate sampling area and RHS reaches; marker boards included for relocation.

- Data collection and methods
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS-compatible)
    - Standardized 3-minute kick-sample using a 25 cm2 pond-net (900 μm mesh) plus 1 minute of manual searching.
    - Sampling area 5–15 m long, proportional to habitat cover; avoid combining multiple distant points.
    - On-site handling: wash net between samples; retain most material; do not retain fish/amphibians/rare large specimens (return live where possible; record presence).
    - Sample area data recorded on RIVPACS Sample Area Form (width, depth, velocity, substrate, etc.).
    - On-site fixation and preservation: 40% formalin to reach ~4% formaldehyde in bag; label each sample and store in pots for transport.
    - Environmental data collected for entire sampling area (width, depth at ¼, ½, ¾; substrate; bank features; vegetation; pH and conductivity).
  - Water chemistry (headwaters)
    - Conductivity and pH measured in the field with Hanna Combi meters; field calibration required.
    - SRP, TON, and alkalinity determined from a filtered 50 mL sample; on-site filtration using disposable 0.45 μm syringe filters; sample bottles labeled with square and date; provide to CEH for lab analysis.
  - Hydromorphology and vegetation (RHS)
    - 500 m RHS survey centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site; documentation of channel features (riffles, pools, banks, vegetation, etc.).
    - Use the 2003 RHS protocol; data entered in RAPID in the field; on-site validation and data checks.
    - Data entry includes spot-checks, randomization of sample points, and relocation data.
  - Aquatic plants (MTR)
    - 100 m macrophyte survey around the macroinvertebrate center; record presence and percent cover (0–9 scale categories) for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plants.
    - Plants identified to species where possible; specimen submission for lab confirmation when needed; rare species flagged for confirmation.
    - Use mean trophic rank (MTR) framework to assess trophic status via macrophyte communities.
  - Data handling and digital tools
    - RHS data entered via RAPID (field tablet); validation checks ensure completeness before leaving site.
    - Aquatic plant data entered in IRIS (two-page form) with drop-downs to reduce errors; on-site validation before departing.
    - Macroinvertebrate and environmental data captured on RIVPACS forms; photographs required for relocation and site description.
  - Field documentation
    - Sketch maps: 50 m river reach indicating sampling area and relocation landmarks.
    - Photographs of sampling area, RHS features, and macrophyte sections; marker boards included in photos for re-location.

- Equipment, safety, and transport
  - Comprehensive field equipment lists (safety gear, nets, GPS, maps, tablets, cameras, etc.) provided per team.
  - Health and safety considerations emphasize risk assessment for each sampling site; high or multiple moderate risks may halt sampling.
  - Two-person survey teams common; standard health and safety guidelines for fieldwork with water apply.
  - Samples transported to CEH Dorset; use Transport Emergency Card (TREM) for formaldehyde-containing samples; courier arrangements and labeling strictly controlled.

- Quality control and assurance
  - All field surveyors hold Environment Agency RHS certification; trained in RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling and MTR aquatic plant surveying.
  - Regular team rotation to maintain consistency; approx. 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff.
  - On-site data validation via RAPID/IRIS; data checks completed before leaving each site.
  - Field survey checklist completed by both surveyors to ensure all tasks completed.

- Pond condition assessment (overview)
  - Nationwide pond condition included in CS2007; ponds identified and initial attributes recorded by mappers.
  - Survey pond chosen per square; includes macrophyte survey, environmental characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Two surveyors work together to minimize health and safety risks in pond environments.
  - Steps include pond mapping, boundary delineation, drawing the pond outline, estimating area, drawdown height, sediment/water depths, and recording pollution, inflows/outflows, management, and surrounding land use.

- Macrophyte survey (detailed)
  - Large species list with identification to species where possible; rare species flagged for confirmation.
  - Survey by walking/wading the outer pond boundary; use grapnel to sample submerged plants where safe.
  - Specimens collected for lab confirmation when necessary; preserved or pressed according to guidelines.
  - Data recorded on pond condition fieldsheets including overall percent cover for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species; overhang by woody vegetation.
  - Species identification support materials and specimen submission protocols provided.

- Data handling and reporting
  - Sampling data exported to Pond Conservation for processing; monthly dispatch targets.
  - Photos, plant specimens, and field sheets coordinated for shipment; standardized labeling and tracking procedures.

- References and contacts
  - References include Environment Agency guidance on River Habitat Survey, MTR macrophyte method, and prior CS methodologies.
  - Contact points provided for sample submission and project coordination.

- Overall takeaway for analysts
  - The Headwaters component provides a standardized, multi-taceted data framework (macroinvertebrates, plants, hydromorphology, chemistry) across GB headwaters and ponds.
  - Emphasizes rigorous on-site data capture, validated by integrated digital tools (RAPID, IRIS, IRIS plant system) and robust QA processes.
  - Data management, sample transport, and relocation documentation are designed to ensure comparability over time and across landscapes.
