# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim and scope
  - Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Policy only concerns survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data remain publicly accessible.

- Who the CS partners are
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
  - Defra; Natural England; Welsh Government; Scottish Government; NIEA; Forestry Commission; Countryside Council for Wales; Scottish Natural Heritage

- Rationale for confidentiality
  - Locations are kept confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Confidentiality protects scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.

- Circumstances for data release and precision
  - four-digit grid references (10x10 km square) may be released under licence to indicate general location within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - six-digit grid references (precise locations) may be released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, with CEH pre-processing to avoid disclosure, and require strong demonstration that IP data require equal or higher confidentiality.
  - spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
  - Licences are finite, tied to specific projects, and data must be destroyed at the end of the licence period.
  - No data release to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - If released, licensees must show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; a clause prevents deriving precise square locations from released data.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; sign-off by authorised representatives.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports decisions under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH may assist with pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be as a collaborator or for payment, negotiated case-by-case.
