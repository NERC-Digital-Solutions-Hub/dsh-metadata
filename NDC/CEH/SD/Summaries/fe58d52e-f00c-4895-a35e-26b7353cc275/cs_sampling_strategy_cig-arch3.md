# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Describes the Sampling Strategy for the Countryside Survey field component up to 2007.
  - The sampling framework is built around the ITE Land Classification, developed over 30 years to stratify GBR land into homogeneous units for robust ecological monitoring.
  - Aims to produce national and regional habitat estimates to support policy, planning, and decision-making.

- Core concepts and approach
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage across diverse land types.
  - Sampling unit: 1 km x 1 km squares; center square plus surrounding squares used for classification.
  - ITE Land Classification provides multiple land classes that describe environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) and underpin sample allocation.
  - National estimates are derived by combining per-square habitat measurements with the area proportions of each land class.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and subsequent multivariate classifications were used to create and refine land classes.

- Key methodological milestones by phase
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
    - 32 land classes derived from 1228 center squares; 6039 km2 classified including surrounding squares.
    - Field survey comprised 256 squares (8 per class).
    - National habitat estimates calculated by multiplying mean habitat area per square by land-class area.
  - 1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - 12 squares surveyed per land class (total 384); eight previously visited squares retained.
    - Results published later; approach still relied on the 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification and Third Field Survey)
    - Extended classification to cover all GB squares; urban/sea corrections included.
    - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of earlier habitat data collected; land-cover map linked.
    - National estimates still anchored to the 1990 Land Classification; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification and Fourth Field Survey)
    - Updated classification to enable separate Scottish reporting; Land Classes increased to 40.
    - 569 squares surveyed; ensured more comprehensive regional detail.
    - National reporting framework prepared for Scotland.
  - 2000 (CS2000: Separate Country Estimates and Further Developments)
    - Introduced separate country-unit estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) using country-specific squares.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; some aggregation to maintain representation, creating 40 strata.
    - Added 19 squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; additional balancing squares to harmonize England and Wales sampling rates.
    - Wales-specific adjustments included sub-division of key classes (e.g., Land Class 17) to improve Wales reporting.
    - An uplands module added (30 extra squares) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007: Wales-Only Reporting and Further Refinements)
    - Welsh-only reporting driven by devolved policymaking needs.
    - Land Classes subdivided into five Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - 43 additional Welsh squares surveyed to ensure adequate representation; two Welsh classes in England had reduced square counts (to 4) with acceptable precision.
    - England adjustments did not require additional English squares beyond Welsh replacements.

- Outputs and representation
  - Tables and maps illustrating the distribution of sample squares across land classes and countries (CS1978 through CS2007).
  - Comprehensive documentation of how many squares were surveyed per class, country, and survey year; details provided in accompanying tables and figures (e.g., Table 2, Table 3, Figures 4–7).
  - Presentation of national estimates and the impact of changing classifications on time-series consistency (note on the trade-off between using the latest classification for current estimates vs maintaining cross-survey consistency with older classifications).

- Country-specific reporting and the Uplands module
  - Wales required earlier and more detailed Welsh-only reporting; led to Welsh class subdivisions and additional Welsh sampling.
  - Uplands module introduced to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Considerations and notes on comparability
  - The 2006 scoping study highlighted that changing the basic classification used for national estimates affects consistency across time; two approaches exist:
    - Use the latest classification for current estimates (more consistent within a survey year and between related surveys).
    - Use the original classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - The document indicates a preference for using the latest classification for consistency within individual surveys, while acknowledging cross-survey comparability challenges.
