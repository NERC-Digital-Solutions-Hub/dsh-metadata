# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification to stratify sampling and enable national habitat estimates.
  - Emphasizes the link between a robust stratified sampling design and the ability to detect change over time.

- Core concept: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling
  - Stratified, random sampling is used to ensure samples represent different land types and ecological conditions.
  - The ITE Land Classification groups land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to form sampling strata.
  - Early approach classified a sample of 1 km squares and used surrounding squares to extend representation within each class.
  - The methodology originated in the 1970s and has evolved through successive CS surveys to improve coverage and regional specificity.

- Chronological development and key changes
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to define 32 land classes from environmental data across 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 × 15 km grid; 1 km squares classified).
    - Sampling: eight squares per land class; total of 256 squares surveyed nationally.
  - 1984 (Second GB field survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (384 total).
    - Continued use of the existing land classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
    - Expanded to classify every square in GB; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
    - Field survey: 508 squares surveyed; continued recording features from earlier survey.
    - National estimates based on the 1990 Land Classification.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; fourth field survey)
    - Land Classification updated to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
    - Results published for CS1990 and CS2000; introduced framework to estimate Scotland separately.
  - 2000 (CS2000; fifth field survey)
    - Separate country estimates formalized (England with Wales, and Scotland) using country-specific classes.
    - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions; aggregation of rare sub-classes within countries.
    - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland habitats added as a dedicated module.
  - 2007 (CS2007; sixth field survey)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements lead to Welsh-class sub-divisions (creating five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class); English representation maintained as practicable.
    - Wales-specific framework implemented to support country-unit estimates.

- How the sampling framework is implemented
  - Land Classes and country-unit frameworks
    - Land Classes sub-divided by country to support England & Wales and Scotland reporting.
    - Aggregation of under-represented classes within a country to ensure robust estimates.
  - Sample allocation and additions
    - Additional squares added to represent new country-specific classes and to improve precision for Wales and upland habitat estimates.
  - Upland module
    - An extra CS2000 module added 30 squares in upland/marginal upland classes to improve habitat estimates in those areas.

- National estimates: how they are derived
  - Estimates are based on the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - Changes in Land Classification affect national estimates; boards across surveys chose approaches to maximize consistency (usually using the latest classification for country estimates within a survey, even if it reduces cross-survey comparability).
  - The approach allows reporting at national and country levels (England with Wales, Scotland) with class-level weighting.

- Practical implications and reporting
  - The framework supports country-specific environmental reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and later Wales-only reporting needs.
  - Wales received enhanced sampling in CS2007 to provide Wales-specific estimates with adequate precision.
  - National estimates are sensitive to changes in the Land Classification; careful interpretation is required when comparing across surveys.
  - The document includes detailed tables and figures (e.g., CS2000 and CS2007 class maps, per-class sample counts) to illustrate the distribution and density of samples across land classes and countries.

- Additional context and references
  - The Sampling Strategy situates its methodology within thirty years of development of the ITE Land Classification, detailing its historical evolution, application to Countryside Survey, and the shift toward country-specific reporting needs.
