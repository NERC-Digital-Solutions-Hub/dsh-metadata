# Sampling design

- Overview of Countryside Survey soils sampling across years: 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019 rolling survey; pilot in 2018; rolling phase aims to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
- Consistency and scale: 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 sampled all 591 CS squares (not all measurements on all samples); 2019 rolling survey expands to ongoing annual sampling.
- Sample location and structure: soils sampled from CS X-plots within each CS square; 5 X-plots per square, randomly spaced; X-plots are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types; relocations occur when plots are destroyed or access is denied; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating square and repeat plot; samples from the same ID originate from the same location, typically 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.
- Sampling method: top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples) collected with a soil core (1978 used a soil pit); in 1998, 2007, and rolling survey (2018/2019–2023) cores hammered in and pulled out; full 15-cm core sometimes not possible due to stones or shallow soils; core photographs and measurements of core dimensions noted in 2007.
- Measurements and data collected: 1978 included pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI); 1990 included some soil mapping; multiple cores per X-plot across 1998, 2007, and rolling survey; various measurements per core; bulk density measured in 2007 and 2018/19–2023 (not via ISO whole-core method); full methodological details available in Emmett et al. 2008.
- Data handling and notes: samples may be homogenised before pH and LOI measurements; different years have different measurement sets; full description and implications discussed in Emmett et al. 2008.
- Statistical analysis guidance: account for land-class structure; without such adjustments, results reflect stock and change of the population rather than national estimates; with land classes, results are weighted national estimates; bootstrapping not always used; mixed models with square as a random factor recommended to account for multiple X-plots per square; design-based approach emphasizes dispersed observations to improve regional estimates; only one core per location, but CS design prioritizes broad coverage over replication per location; consult UKCEH before analysis and check CS publications listed on the CS website.
