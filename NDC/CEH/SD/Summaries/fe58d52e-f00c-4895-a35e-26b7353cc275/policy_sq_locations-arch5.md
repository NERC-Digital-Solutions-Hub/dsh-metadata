# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Aims and Scope
- Maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies to location data (four-digit and six-digit grid references) and spatial data inside survey squares; not to other CS data.

## Governance and Partners
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme.
- 2007 CS partners: NERC, UKCEH, Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Confidentiality Rationale
- Location data are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, environmental integrity, and landowner permission; protects ability to inform policy.

## Release Circumstances and Precision
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references released under license to indicate 10 km grid squares.
- Precise locations: six-digit references released only if pre-processing by UKCEH can avoid disclosure; exceptionally, external release under license if IP data require equal/higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares carry equivalent confidentiality; released only under same exceptional terms.

## Conditions of Release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to authorized individuals for the project.
- Licences are finite; data must be destroyed at project end; no third-party sharing that could reveal square locations.
- Data must not be used to plan visits or verify landowner compliance.
- Evidence of project management standards (at least JCOP) may be required.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements; must not enable deduction of precise square locations.

## Licensing and Responsibilities
- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional access and issues licenses.
- Hardcopy licenses must be signed by authorized representatives; denial follows statutory procedures.
- UKCEH provides an annual report summarising access applications and decision grounds.
- Reasonable preprocessing time by UKCEH is expected; cross-organisational requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult UKCEH before using data; involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
