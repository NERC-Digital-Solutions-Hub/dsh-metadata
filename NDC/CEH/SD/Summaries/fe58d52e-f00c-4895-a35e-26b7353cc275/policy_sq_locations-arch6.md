# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Purpose: maximise public usefulness of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of survey square locations.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Funding and program: 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.
- Partners (2007): NERC (including CEH), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
- Public interest stance: requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations may be released
- Four-digit grid references (approximate locations): may be released under a license to identify the 10 km x 10 km grid square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations): only released if UKCEH pre-processes analysis to avoid release; in very exceptional cases external release under license if IP data require equal/higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps): treated as equivalent to location data; released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- In all cases, releases are governed by licensing and confidentiality restrictions.

## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licensees must maintain data confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licenses are finite in duration, for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the license period.
- End of license: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult UKCEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit release licenses have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; users must not attempt to derive precise square locations from data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licenses containing the policy terms.
- Licenses must be signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee organization.
- If an approval is denied, UKCEH follows Act and Regulations procedures and supports the decision.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications for location data and the decision grounds.
- For practical use, internal CS partnership needs may require UKCEH pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; responses to external requests are case-by-case.
- Recommendation to consult UKCEH before committing to using data covered by this policy; consultation may help define requirements and/or support appropriate use (collaborative or paid arrangements negotiated case-by-case).
