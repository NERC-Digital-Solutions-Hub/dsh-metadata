# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies specifically to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Background and governance
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE National Capability.
- CS partners include UKCEH, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH (as relevant roles).

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Location confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and the CS partners under FOI and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access and release conditions
- Data can be released at varying precision:
  - Four-digit grid references (approximate locations) may be released under licence to identify 10 km x 10 km grid squares.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require exceptional justification; UKCEH pre-processing should be used where possible.
  - Very exceptional external releases of six-digit data require demonstration that IP data/models have equal/higher confidentiality.
  - Spatial data within squares (maps, habitats, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional-terms framework.
- Licenses are finite, for specific projects, and data must not be retained beyond the licensed period.

## Licensing terms and responsibilities
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licenses with confidentiality clauses.
- Licences must be signed by an authorised representative of the licensee organization.
- If approval is denied, procedures under FOI/EIR are followed.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with annual reports detailing access applications and decision grounds.
- Pre-processing support from UKCEH should be feasible within moderate demand; other requests handled case-by-case.
- CS partners and potential users are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to using data covered by this policy.

## Data handling and compliance
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to authorised personnel.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation of data security maintained and data destroyed.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to assess landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees may need to demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; both prohibit attempts to derive precise locations.

## For analysts: implications and actions
- Data access is controlled and traceable via formal licensing; broader public access to precise locations is restricted.
- Analysts should engage with UKCEH early to define requirements and determine whether pre-processing can address needs without exposing precise locations.
- When using four-digit releases, analysts must avoid attempting to locate exact square positions and ensure compliance with license terms.
- Anticipate potential delays or limitations when requesting high-precision location data; plan analyses around permissible data (e.g., approximate locations or aggregated outputs).
- Annual licensing activity and decisions may influence timelines for monitoring projects; maintain appropriate documentation and destruction confirmations.
