# Sampling design

- Purpose and scope: Countryside Survey (CS) soils are sampled to monitor environmental condition over time using standardized methods and to enable national-scale estimates and trend analysis.
- Timeframe and progression: sampling occurred in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019; a pilot in 2018 preceded a rolling survey starting in 2019, aiming to sample ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
- Sample size and design evolution:
  - 1978 and 1998: the same 256 CS squares were sampled.
  - 2007: soils collected from all 591 CS squares, though not all measurements were made on all samples.
  - Power analyses (Emmett et al. 2008) guided the number of samples needed to detect significant change.
- Analytical philosophy: emphasize standardized approaches and data quality for consistent national estimates of environmental stocks and changes.

## Sample location

- Within-square sampling: soils are collected from CS X-plots, with 5 X-plots randomly spaced in each CS square.
- Non-replicate nature: X-plots within a square are not replicates; they may reflect different land uses, soil types, etc.
- Relocation and repeat identifiers: some X-plots are moved or replaced due to access or destruction; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) to refer to the same location across surveys.
- Spatial context: exact sampling points within a 2 m × 2 m plot are 2–3 m apart around the plot corners.
- Documentation: reference to Emmett et al. (2008) for detailed methodology.

## Sampling

- Depth and method:
  - Top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples) are collected.
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling CS surveys use soil cores hammered in and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit to access the top 15 cm.
  - In some soils, stones or shallow depth prevent reaching full 15 cm.
- Core handling and measurements:
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements were taken for 2 of the 4 cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).
  - Rolling CS survey adopts the core-based approach established earlier.
- Multiple cores and measurements:
  - From 1998, 2007, and rolling surveys, multiple cores are taken per X-plot, with different cores subjected to different measurements.
  - Bulk density measurements occurred in 2007 and in 2018/19–2023, but not via ISO bulk density methodology (which would require an entire core).

## Measurements

- Early measurements: 1978 laboratory measurements included pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- No horizon-based chemistry: analyses are not performed by soil horizons; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
- Varied core measurements: across years, different cores carry different measurement sets; full chemical analyses by horizons are not described.
- Documentation: Emmett et al. (2008) provides full method development, power analyses, and protocols; a related report discusses implications of non-ISO bulk density methods.

## Statistical analysis

- Consideration of data structure:
  - Land class structure can influence results; ignoring it yields stock and change of the population, while accounting for it yields national estimates weighted by land classes.
- Bootstrapping: not always used in analyses of CS soils data.
- Model recommendations:
  - Use the CS structure: at minimum, apply a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for multiple X-plots per CS square.
  - Design-based vs model-based: CS’s dispersed sampling design aims to increase precision and regional coverage; spatial structure is not the primary interest.
- Practical guidance:
  - Users should consult UKCEH before analysis and interpretation.
  - Check CS publications and the CS website for existing analyses and outputs.

## Data management and access

- Data provenance and reuse:
  - Emphasized need to store and upload created datasets to appropriate portals.
  - Encouraged data combination with other relevant datasets to increase value beyond single-use outputs.
- Transparency and accessibility: enable access to the underlying data after creating final outputs to support broader scrutiny and reuse.
