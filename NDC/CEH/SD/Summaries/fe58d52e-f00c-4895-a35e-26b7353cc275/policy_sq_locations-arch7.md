# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: Maximise utility of CS spatial data for public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Program and partners: 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC. List of 2007 CS partners includes UKCEH (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology) and other UK government and non-government bodies.

## Why locations are confidential

- To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for survey integrity, environmental protection, and future access to land.
- Accessibility requests handled by UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released

- Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10 km × 10 km grid square) can be released under licence to help determine whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit (precise) locations: only released in very exceptional circumstances, after demonstrating that external analysis would carry equal or higher confidentiality protection than CS data; UKCEH may perform pre-processing to avoid external release.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality to location data and follow the same exceptional release terms.

## Specific release conditions

- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and limit access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and written confirmation provided at the end of the period.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; if in doubt, consult UKCEH.
- Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar licensing terms but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases; a clause prevents attempts to derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities and process

- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences reflecting policy terms; approvals or denials follow statutory procedures.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For practical implementation, UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes, subject to demand; other organisations’ requests are case-by-case.
- Recommendation to consult with UKCEH before using CS location data; involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case by case.

## Practical considerations for GIS specialists

- Understand the data access levels: four-digit grid references vs. six-digit precise locations, and the circumstances that justify their release.
- Plan analyses to use aggregated or pre-processed data when possible to avoid needing precise locations.
- Implement strict data governance: secure storage, restricted access, finite licensing periods, and secure destruction after use.
- Avoid attempts to infer exact locations from released data; comply with licensing restrictions and confidentiality clauses.
- If in doubt, engage with UKCEH early to define requirements and appropriate use of the data.
