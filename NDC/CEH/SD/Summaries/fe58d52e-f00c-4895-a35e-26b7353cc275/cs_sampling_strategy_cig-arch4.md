# THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

- Purpose: Document the sampling framework and development of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify and sample Countryside Survey field work up to 2007; explains how national, regional, and country-specific habitat estimates are derived from a stratified, random sample of 1 km squares.

- Core approach
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain's varied landscapes.
  - Use of the ITE Land Classification to define strata (land classes) that reflect ecological and land-use variation.
  - Estimates of habitat areas are calculated as the mean habitat area per square within a land class, multiplied by the total area of that class.

- Key concepts and methods
  - Land Classification origin: started with environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) and used indicators of ecological groups to create land classes.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used in early development to group 1 km squares into 32 classes.
  - Sampling unit: 1 km squares; sampling within each land class chosen randomly to achieve adequate representation.
  - Early sampling design: eight squares per class (total of 256) for CS1978; later CS1984 used 12 squares per class (384 total).

- Timeline of developments (sampling framework and land classification)
  - 1978 (Initial survey): ISA-based land classification; 32 classes; 8 squares per class; 6039 km² of classified squares used to estimate class areas.
  - 1984 (2nd field survey): framework retained; sample increased to 12 squares per class; total 384 squares.
  - 1990 (All Squares/Land Classification): comprehensive revision to classify every GB 1 km square; 508 squares surveyed; added Land Cover Map linkage; national estimates recalculated using the updated classification.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification): expansion to enable Scotland-only reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
  - 2000 (CS2000): adjustments for separate country estimates (England with Wales vs Scotland); subdivision and aggregation of classes to create 40 strata; added 19 extra squares to improve representation; upland habitat module introduced later.
  - 2007 (CS2007): further Welsh-only reporting adjustments; subdivision of classes into country-unit versions (England-Wales and Scotland); total strata increased to 45; additional squares allocated to Wales to ensure representation; two Welsh sub-classes added to legend; Isle of Man squares removed and replaced by England squares.

- Land classification details and country-specific adaptations
  - Original 32 Land Classes described by environmental attributes and land use.
  - Revisions expanded to about 40+ classes; later country-unit subdivisions created five new Welsh/English sub-classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) for Wales reporting.
  - By CS2007, 45 strata with Wales-focused representations; England adjustments balanced by maintaining adequate England coverage.
  - Isle of Man: previously included squares replaced with England squares for country-unit reporting.

- Country-specific reporting and sampling adjustments
  - Separate country estimates introduced to provide England-with-Wales and Scotland reporting.
  - Sampling frame adapted to ensure sufficient representation within each country unit; additional squares allocated to Wales to improve Welsh estimates.
  - Wales became the most intensively sampled country in CS2007 due to devolution-driven policy needs; England had fewer Welsh-specific squares but maintained precision in key classes.

- Uplands and data quality considerations
  - An additional uplands module in CS2000 added 30 squares within upland land classes to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
  - The document emphasizes consistency and comparability across surveys, noting that changing the basic land classification framework affects the consistency of national estimates.

  - CS1990: Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - CS2000: Countryside Survey 2000 – separate country reporting; methodology adjustments to enable country-unit estimates.
  - CS2007: Countryside Survey 2007 – UK results with Wales-only reporting and detailed country-specific framework.
  - Acknowledges earlier and later methodological papers and supporting documentation, including the interplay between land classification, sampling, and national statistics.

- Practical notes for data leaders
  - The sampling strategy relies on linking land-class-based strata to area estimates and habitat means to derive national and regional habitat stocks.
  - Changes in land classification over time can affect cross-survey comparability; alignment to the latest classification improves within-survey consistency, while consistency across surveys may favor historical classifications.
  - Data quality improvements came through increasing sample counts in under-represented classes and countries (notably Wales) and adding modules (uplands) to address specific policy-relevant estimates.
