# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the sampling design, locations, procedures, measurements, and statistical approaches used to monitor soil properties across Countryside Survey (CS) years.
  - Aims to detect significant change over time and inform methodological choices for future monitoring.

- Sampling design and timeline
  - 1978 and 1998: same 256 CS squares sampled.
  - 2007: samples collected from all 591 CS squares.
  - Rolling survey: initiated in 2018–2019, with the goal of measuring ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
  - Power analyses (Emmett et al. 2008) guided sample size decisions.

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Within each CS square, soils are sampled from 5 randomly spaced X-plots.
  - X-plots are not replicates due to varying land uses and soil types within a square.
  - Plots can be relocated over time due to destruction, access permissions, or uncertainty about the original location.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) to link repeated visits; exact sampling positions shift ~2–3 m within a permanently marked 2 m x 2 m plot.

- Sampling methods
  - Soil collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling survey (2018/2019–2023): use soil cores hammered into the soil.
  - 1978: soil pits used to collect from the top 15 cm of the profile.
  - Some cores cannot reach full depth due to stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions recorded in 2007 for select cores.
  - Rolling CS adopted the core-based approach.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990: some soil mapping activities conducted.
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling survey: multiple cores per X-plot; different cores carry different measurements.
  - Chemical analyses by horizon were not performed; samples homogenised prior to pH and LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and in 2018/19–2023 (not using ISO bulk density method).
  - A detailed methods report and implications are available (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Statistical analysis and interpretation
  - Analyses should consider land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock and change of the population, while accounting for land classes yields national estimates of stock and change.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses.
  - CS design emphasizes accounting for spatial structure: use a mixed model with square as a random factor to reflect multiple X-plots within each square.
  - Design-based perspective: a dispersed set of observations can increase overall precision and regional coverage even if only one core is taken per location.
  - For regional estimates, broad spatial dissemination of samples is advantageous.
  - Users are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and to review CS publications accessible via the CS website for context and methods.

- Data, metadata, and governance notes
  - Emphasis on transparent methodologies and references (e.g., Emmett et al. 2008) to support interpretation.
  - The rolling design and repeat identifiers necessitate careful tracking of locations and cores across years.
  - The protocol highlights the importance of clear documentation of methods, sample locations, and measurement techniques to support data sharing and reuse.
