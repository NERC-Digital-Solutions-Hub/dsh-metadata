# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Overview
- Describes the field sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007 and its evolution.
- Ties the sampling design to the ITE Land Classification, a core stratification system developed over 30+ years.
- Aims to produce robust national and country-level estimates of habitat features from a representative, stratified sample.

## Core concepts
- Stratified random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representativeness across ecological variation.
- Use of a Land Classification system to define strata (originally 32 classes, later expanded).
- Field sampling focused on 1 km squares to balance survey feasibility with ecological detail.
- National estimates are derived by combining mean habitat values per square with the area represented by each land class.

## Land Classification: evolution and role
- 1978: ITE Land Classification created from environmental attributes, producing 32 classes; base sampling used the centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid.
- 1984: Classification extended to include all 1 km squares for a broader land-use focus; sample increased to 384 squares.
- 1990: Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; 40 classes introduced; urban/sea corrections incorporated; 508 squares surveyed.
- 1998–2000: Further development to support Scotland-only and England/Wales reporting; expanded to 40 classes, then subdivided to allow country-specific estimates; regional and country-based sampling adjustments implemented.
- 2007: Welsh reporting needs drive further refinements; five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) create 45 strata; additional Welsh squares added to ensure representation; some English classes reduced in representation accordingly.
- Across revisions, the Land Classification maps underpin the stratification and allocation of survey squares.

## Sampling framework by survey year
- CS1978: 256 squares surveyed (8 per Land Class); focus on vegetation quadrats and soils; early national habitat estimates derived from class-level proportions.
- CS1984: 384 squares surveyed (12 per Land Class); framework retained but expanded sampling within classes.
- CS1990: 508 squares surveyed; Land Classification updated to include all GB squares; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; national estimates still based on the 1990 classification.
- CS2000: Sampling expanded to support separate England & Wales and Scotland estimates; introduced country-unit classifications and expanded strata to 40 (eventually 40–45) with additional squares to improve representation; uplands module added for England/Wales to improve upland habitat estimates.
- CS2007: Wales-specific reporting requirements drive subdivision of classes (five new Welsh country-unit classes) and additional Welsh squares; overall sampling adjusted to maintain accuracy across country units; upland and marginal upland sampling emphasized.

## Country-level and uplands adjustments
- Separate country estimates implemented to provide England with Wales and Scotland-specific results.
- Class sub-division and aggregation implemented to ensure adequate representation within each country unit; additional squares allocated to maintain precision across new Welsh/UK classifications.
- Uplands module introduced in CS2000 to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

## Data outputs and use
- National habitat estimates calculated as the product of mean habitat area per square and the total area of each Land Class, with adjustments for country/unit boundaries.
- Land Classification serves as the primary framework for stratification and estimation across surveys.
- Results for key CS surveys published in CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, linking to the Land Cover Map and other ecological data resources.
- Outputs include maps and tables detailing survey squares, class distributions, and sampling rates, supporting policy, planning, and environmental reporting.

## Data quality, comparability, and challenges
- Changing the underlying Land Classification affects cross-survey comparability; using the latest classification within a survey aids internal consistency, while cross-survey consistency can be enhanced by re-analysing with a common basis (as discussed in notes on national estimates).
- Early computational limits constrained full classification of all GB squares; later revisions used surrogates and neighbour-class assignments with acceptable retention of class characteristics.
- Representation imbalances emerged as classifications evolved; Wales and Scotland required targeted sampling adjustments to deliver robust Wales-only and Scotland-only results.
- Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates after CS1990; England and Wales required increased Welsh sampling to achieve adequate representation.
