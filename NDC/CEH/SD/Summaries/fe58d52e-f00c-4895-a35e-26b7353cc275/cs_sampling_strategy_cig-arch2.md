## The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose
  - Outline the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) and its evolution, tied to the ITE Land Classification, to provide a consistent, time-series basis for monitoring environmental condition and policy performance.
  - Emphasise standardized methods, quality data handling, and clear outputs (reports, maps, charts) with datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.

- Core concepts
  - ITE Land Classification
    - A stratified framework developed over time to segment Great Britain into land classes, used to ensure representative sampling across ecological types.
    - Started in the 1970s with 32 classes; expanded and revised across surveys to improve regional, national, and country-specific estimates.
  - Stratified random sampling
    - Samples are drawn within defined land classes (strata) to avoid bias and improve representativeness.
    - Sampling units typically based on 1 km square centers within a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares classified to reflect local context.
  - National estimates
    - Estimates are derived by multiplying the mean habitat area per square within a land class by the land-class area, then aggregating across classes.
    - The strategy discusses consistency across surveys when changing classifications and the option to use older classifications for cross-survey consistency.

- Chronology: Land Classification and Countryside Survey progress
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - ISA-based classification yielding 32 land classes from climate, geology, altitude, etc.
    - Sampled 8 squares per class (total 256) to estimate national habitat areas.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (total 384) to strengthen estimates.
  - 1990 CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification)
    - Expanded to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed in the field.
    - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; used revised classification for national estimates.
  - 1998–2000 (CS2000)
    - Land Classification extended to enable separate country reporting (England & Wales, Scotland) with 40 strata.
    - Introduction of country-unit versions of land classes, plus aggregation where needed; added 19 extra squares to strengthen new classes, plus upland-focused sampling.
    - Additional upland module funded to improve estimates for uplands in England and Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Welsh-only reporting refined due to devolution needs.
    - Introduction of Welsh country-unit sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expansion to 45 strata.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares to improve Wales-specific estimates; England adjusted correspondingly (some classes ended with fewer squares).
    - Revised land-class maps and a new CS2007 sampling framework reflecting England, Wales, and Scotland.

- Sampling design and allocation details
  - Global approach
    - Use centre squares from a regular 15 x 15 km grid to define strata; allocate sampling effort to ensure representation across land classes.
    - For CS1978, eight squares per class; CS1984 increased to 12; CS1990 moved to all-squares classification with selective addition for larger classes; CS2000 and CS2007 introduced country-specific subdivisions and new classes.
  - Country-specific estimates and class restructuring
    - CS2000: subdivided classes by country unit (England & Wales, Scotland) and adjusted sampling to maintain representation; added upland sampling module.
    - CS2007: added Welsh-specific sub-classes and additional Welsh squares to enable Wales-only reporting; relative sampling rates adjusted to maintain precision.
  - Uplands module
    - Extra squares placed in upland classes to boost statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

- Outputs, data handling, and monitoring implications
  - Outputs are prepared as reports, maps, and charts to illustrate habitat status and change over time.
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals to enable wider access and reuse.
  - The strategy supports topic-specific environmental monitoring while preserving a consistent, long-term framework for trend detection.

- Note on national estimates and classification changes
  - Changing the basic classification used for national estimates affects consistency of stock estimates; CS recommends using the latest classification for national estimates, while acknowledging older classifications may be used for cross-survey consistency.
  - Table and appendix content illustrate how sample sizes and strata have evolved across surveys, and how national estimates can be derived under different classification schemes.

- Practical implications for Analysts
  - The sampling framework provides a robust, time-series basis for monitoring environmental health and policy outcomes, with standardized methods enabling comparability over decades.
  - The evolution to country-specific estimates (including Wales) and upland modules reflects policy needs and devolution context, facilitating more targeted environmental reporting and decision-making.
  - There is an emphasis on data quality, reproducibility, and making underlying data accessible to support broader use and value from the monitoring datasets.
