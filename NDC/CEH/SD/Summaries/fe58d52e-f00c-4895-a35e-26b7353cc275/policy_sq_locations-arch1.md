# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Background and scope
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
- 2007 CS partners include UKCEH, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and securing permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality considered in the public interest; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how location data can be released
- Four-digit grid references (approximate locations) may be released under licence to identify CS squares within 10 km grid squares.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing by UKCEH to avoid release; only in very exceptional cases may external release be allowed under licence.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-terms release conditions.

## Specific conditions of release (licensing terms)
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and written confirmation provided at the end of the period.
- No data or derived information may be shared with third parties that could compromise square locations.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check compliance by landowners.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same high IP confidentiality; a clause prevents attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH follows FOI/Environmental Regulation procedures.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- UKCEH aims to provide reasonable preprocessing support within moderate demand; other organisations’ requests handled case-by-case.
- Partner organisations are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to CS location data use; collaboration or paid support may be negotiated case by case.
