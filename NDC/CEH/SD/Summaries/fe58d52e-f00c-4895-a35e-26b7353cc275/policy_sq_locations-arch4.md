# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and Scope
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Background and Partners
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling programme funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.
- 2007 CS partners include NERC (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Confidentiality Rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality protects future survey integrity, environmental protection, and permission from landowners.
- Requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access and Release Framework
- Approximate location can be released to identify if squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) using four-digit grid references (10 km × 10 km grid).
- Precise six-digit locations only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; UKCEH may pre-process analyses to avoid releasing locations.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, linear features) carries equivalent confidentiality and will be released under the same exceptional terms.

## Conditions of Release
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed at licence end; no retention for other responsibilities.
- No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; avoid using data to inform visits or check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.

## Licensing Details and IP Considerations
- Four-digit grid reference releases have lower IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; licensing terms differ accordingly.
- A clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from supplied data or to claim such derivations.

## Roles, Governance, and Reporting
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, approves exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- UKCEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Internal pre-processing support for CS partnership requests may be provided within moderate demand; external requests are considered case-by-case.

## Practical Guidance for Data Leaders
- Consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; may provide scientific leadership to define requirements and support appropriate use.
- Collaboration or payment for UKCEH involvement is negotiated case-by-case.
- Follow up with UKCEH regarding internal processes and compliance requirements.
