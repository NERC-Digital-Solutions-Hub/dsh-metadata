# Background

- This policy provides a standard to assess the quality of the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) as a source of scientific advice and evidence fit for purpose, aligned with government guidelines and JNCC guidance. Evidence encompasses expert opinion, data, methodologies, results, and interpretations; QA includes monitoring and auditing, guided by “Fit for purpose” and “Right first time” principles.

## NPMS objectives

- Detect changes in the quality of priority habitats.
- Understand drivers and pressures behind observed changes.
- Contribute data for the UK Biodiversity Indicator C7 (Plants of the wider countryside) by measuring changes in plant communities across important habitats.

## Quality assurance framework and EQA application

- EQA is supported by multiple publications and internal reports, including peer-reviewed articles on ecological monitoring with citizen science and NPMS design, as well as internal design and development reports.
- The NPMS QA process covers design, data collection, analysis, publishing, and reporting, with oversight by a project team and external peer review where risk warrants.

## Key QA elements and processes

- Design and sampling
  - Sample stratification and survey design developed via expert consultation and workshops.
  - Plot selection uses a regular grid of square plots and gridlines for linear plots; design is intended to be random with respect to underlying landscapes.
  - Habitat definitions developed through habitat expert peer review.
  - Target species list developed by the project with objectivity, aiming for indicators that are unbiased and fit for volunteer engagement.
- Field methods and participation
  - Field recording conducted by volunteers with varying botanical expertise; three levels of contribution; extensive guidance and training provided.
  - Formal QA of field recording is not currently part of NPMS but will be considered in the future.
- Data input, verification, and metadata
  - Online data capture ensures structured data in a spatial database.
  - Use of a species dictionary, calendar dates, map-based locations, and controlled habitat/sample terms; covers vegetation height and cover values.
  - Automated verification (e.g., geographic range checks) plus a verification system for records requiring higher botanical expertise (via BSBI-affiliated experts).
- Data publishing and transparency
  - Data from NPMS will be publicly available to enable independent review of results.
  - Analysis conducted by experienced quantitative ecologists using R; reporting through NPMS newsletters and peer-reviewed publications.
- Quality controls, uncertainty, and bias reduction
  - Outputs reviewed by scientists to ensure claims are evidence-supported.
  - Robust statistical design employed to allow estimation of uncertainty via models.
  - Biases mitigated through the study design and statistical approaches.
- Documentation, versioning, and data management
  - All design work documented; versioned outputs archived and backed up off-site per CEH’s Data Management Plan.
  - PRINCE2 project management standards followed by project managers.

## Governance, review, and transparency

- Oversight by a project Steering Group; external peer review conducted when necessary based on risk (e.g., survey design workshops).
- Uncertainty, assumptions, and limitations are clearly communicated in outputs (newsletters, reports); continuous critique from the CEH Monitoring science community is expected.
- Document tracking and version control are integral; design outputs and reports are versioned and archived with off-site backups.

## Data management, publishing, and participant engagement

- Data management plan governs handling, storage, and sharing; emphasis on open data and public access for independent scrutiny.
- Engagement of volunteers emphasized; recruitment, training, and support structures are part of ensuring data quality and participant retention.
- Remote areas and participation levels are considered in ongoing evaluation and future improvements.

## Annex 1: Methodological paper outline (NPMS)

- Introduction: context and need for structured observational plant data.
- Rationale, requirements, aims: justification for design choices and aims.
- Design: sampling framework (monad weighting, plot placement), habitat and species selection, field methods, timing, and repeat surveys.
- Maximising volunteer participation: recruitment, training, launch, and coordination.
- Discussion: initial evaluation, participation levels, coverage in remote areas, and future plans.

## Relevance for Data Stewards

- NPMS demonstrates rigorous QA and EQA integration across design, data capture, verification, analysis, and reporting, with explicit governance and version control.
- Practices to adopt or adapt:
  - Implement structured data dictionaries, controlled vocabularies, and metadata for datasets.
  - Establish online data capture with automated validation and expert verification workflows.
  - Use a robust data management plan and versioned documentation, with off-site backups and standardized project management (e.g., PRINCE2).
  - Plan for public data release with transparent uncertainty communication and independent review.
  - Maintain governance structures (steering or oversight groups) and document all QA decisions and risk assessments.
