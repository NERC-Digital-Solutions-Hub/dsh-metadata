# National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) – Quality Assurance and Evidence Quality Assurance (EQA) Policy

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a standard to assess the quality of NPMS as a source of scientific advice and evidence fit for policy use.
  - Aligns with Government and Defra guidance on scientific advice in policy making and associated QA practices.

- Key definitions
  - Evidence: includes expert opinion, data, methodologies, results, interpretations, and synthesized scientific information.
  - Quality assurance (QA): processes ensuring outputs meet quality standards, with monitoring and auditing; aims for “fit for purpose” and “right first time.”

- Objectives of NPMS
  - Detect changes in quality of priority habitats.
  - Understand drivers/pressures behind observed change.
  - Contribute data for the UK Biodiversity Indicator C7 (Plants of the wider countryside) by measuring plant community change across key habitats.

- Application of EQA to NPMS
  - Publications supporting EQA:
    - Published peer-reviewed articles (e.g., 2015 Ecological Monitoring with citizen science).
    - Articles in preparation (comparative models for plant data; design of a new UK plant monitoring scheme).
    - Other published pieces and internal/CEH reports.
  - Relevance to EQA questions:
    - Q1: Methods and publications peer-reviewed; involvement of statistical and botanical experts; field testing with volunteers; data collection and habitats defined; field recording by volunteers with multiple expertise levels; guidance and training; data input using structured spatial database; spelling out verification by botanical experts; data publishing for independent review; analysis by experienced quantitative ecologists; dissemination via NPMS newsletters and peer-reviewed outlets.
    - Q2: Governance via project Steering Group; external peer review where risk dictates; design workshops with experts.
    - Q3: Uncertainty, quality, assumptions, limitations communicated through review checks and ongoing critique from CEH Monitoring scientists; outputs reviewed to ensure evidence supports claims.
    - Q4: Bias avoidance through robust statistical design enabling uncertainty estimation in models.
    - Q5: Documentation and version control; design work tracked and archived off-site per a CEH Data Management Plan; PRINCE2-based project management standards.
  - Annex 1: Methodological paper outline for NPMS, with sections on introduction, rationale, design, volunteer participation, and discussion.

- NPMS design and data handling (GIS-relevant focus)
  - Sampling design:
    - Regular grid of square plots and gridlines for linear plots; random with respect to underlying landscape to minimize bias.
  - Habitat and target species:
    - Habitat definitions and species indicator selections developed with peer review and project team input.
  - Field data collection:
    - Conducted by volunteers with three participation levels; training and guidance provided; emphasis on scalable participation.
  - Data capture and verification:
    - Online data entry into a structured spatial database; use of species dictionaries, controlled terms, and geospatial location data.
    - Automated checks (e.g., geographic range) and expert verification for records requiring high botanical expertise.
  - Data publishing and reuse:
    - Data will be publicly available to enable independent review of results.
  - Analysis and reporting:
    - Conducted by experienced quantitative ecologists using R; reporting produced by a multidisciplinary project team (botany, statistics, communication) for researchers, volunteers, policy-makers, and the public.
  - Visualization and maps:
    - Outputs designed to communicate spatial patterns of change and habitat quality; maps and other visualizations support decision-making and monitoring.

- Governance, risk, and QA processes
  - Oversight by a project Steering Group.
  - External peer review engaged where risk warrants.
  - Uncertainty and limitations transparently communicated in outputs.
  - Document and version control:
    - All design work reported; versions archived; backups off-site; governed by a Data Management Plan and PRINCE2 standards.

- Annex 1: Outline of methodological paper (NPMS)
  - Introduction: need for structured observational plant data; comparisons with other taxa.
  - Rationale and aims: address lack of structured data; power to detect change.
  - Design: consultation, sampling framework, habitat and species selection, field methods, plot size/placement, timing and visits, relocation.
  - Maximising volunteer participation: recruitment, training, launch, coordination.
  - Discussion: initial evaluation, participation levels, remote areas, future plans.

- Implications for GIS specialists
  - NPMS relies on spatially explicit data captured on a grid-based plotting framework and gridline plots, suitable for map-based analysis and visualization.
  - Emphasis on a robust spatial database, standardized geospatial data capture, and automated geospatial quality checks.
  - Public data publication supports transparency and external validation of spatial results.
  - Clear documentation of uncertainty and limitations enhances map-based interpretation for policy, stakeholders, and the public.
