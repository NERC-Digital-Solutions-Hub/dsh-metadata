# National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS)

- A joint scheme (BSBI, CEH, JNCC, Plantlife) designed to collect statistically robust plant data in 28 NPMS habitats (grouped into 11 broad categories) to map plant distributions, monitor habitat condition, and provide evidence of environmental state to UK and national governments, with annual feedback to volunteers.
- Aims to learn where wild plants grow and how they change, assess habitat condition, and use plants as indicators of environmental health.

- Habitat and species framework
  - Record abundance of species within fixed plots across 28 fine NPMS habitats (up to 30 species per habitat) using habitat-indicator lists.
  - Where possible, identify the fine habitat; if uncertain, use the broad category list. Species lists are provided in NPMS materials.

- Survey design and plotting
  - Each kilometre square should include a minimum of 5 plots across different NPMS habitats.
  - Plot types: typically 3 square plots (5x5 m) and 2 linear plots (1x25 m); woodlands use 10x10 m squares.
  - Most plots target a single NPMS habitat; aim to place plots in different habitats within the square when possible.
  - Pre-selected plot locations are shown on the square map; if inaccessible or unsuitable, Protocol A self-selected plots can be used.
  - Special plotting rules for ponds, rivers, hedgerows, arable margins, road verges, and wetlands are provided to maximize habitat representation while ensuring safety and relocatability.

- Plot relocation and documentation
  - Plots should be easy to relocate in future years; include field sketches with compass direction and permanent features, photos (up to 2 per plot), and GPS/grid references when available.
  - If plots fall outside NPMS habitat definitions over time, continue monitoring with the appropriate NPMS species list as long as possible to capture habitat change.

- Survey levels (progression encouraged)
  - Wildflower Level: recording a subset of species.
  - Indicator Level: full set of indicator species for robust habitat assessment.
  - Inventory Level: Indicator Level plus recording all other vascular plants present.
  - Progression to higher levels is encouraged to improve data robustness.

- Data collection and entry
  - Record presence/absence of species and estimate abundance by percent cover using a standardized Domin scale.
  - Also record bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen covers; supplement with optional data (vegetation height classes, woodedness) and site attributes (aspect, slope, management, grazing intensity).
  - Additional information helps interpretation but may be optional.
  - Data should be entered online at npms.org.uk; if online entry is not possible, data can be posted using monitoring forms.

- Plot layout specifics and habitat guidance
  - Square plots: 5x5 m (woodlands 10x10 m); position plots to aid relocation; document orientation and surroundings.
  - Linear plots: 1x25 m; place along identifiable linear features; ponds are treated as linear plots if applicable.
  - Specific habitat rules for arable margins, road verges, hedgerows, standing waters, springs, flushes, and screes are provided to maximize habitat representation and safety.
  - For special habitats (e.g., rock outcrops, screes, montane habitats), follow safety guidelines and survey only accessible areas.

- Data handling, access, and support
  - Volunteers receive a map, species guides, NPMS species lists, and monitoring forms; further support and FAQs available on the NPMS website.
  - An introduction letter is available to assist with land access; volunteers should respect countryside use, safety, and landowner permissions.
  - If you cannot enter online, send forms by post to the NPMS Volunteer Coordinator.

- Access rights, safety, and responsibilities
  - Adhere to country-specific access codes (England/Wales: Countryside Code; Scotland: Outdoor Access Code; Northern Ireland: guidance by NI Environment Agency).
  - Only enter private land with permission; use public rights of way or Open Access Land where applicable.
  - Prioritize personal safety: check weather, survey with a buddy when possible, carry a mobile phone and first-aid kit, and avoid dangerous or unsafe plots.

- Habitat types (Appendix overview)
  - 28 fine NPMS habitats grouped into 11 broad categories (e.g., Arable field margins; Bog and wet heath; Broadleaved woodland; Coast; Fresh water; Heathland; Lowland grassland; Marsh and Fen; Native pinewood and juniper scrub; Rock outcrops; Upland grassland).
  - Each category includes habitat-specific guidance and example species assemblages to guide plotting and recording.

- Scoring and data interpretation
  - Domin Scale: percentage cover and individual counts are translated into a standardized score (1–10 scale for percent cover; 1–10 for individuals) to quantify abundance and cover within plots.
  - A 1x1 m area in larger plots corresponds to a 1% unit on the Domin scale; guidance exists for translating observations to scale values, including how to handle dispersed individuals and clumps.

- What happens if species are not present
  - Recording fewer target species is still valuable; absence of expected indicators can signal habitat decline or change.
  - An online facility allows recording of additional species of interest outside the target list, for broader analyses, though these feed into different aspects of the analyses than the core habitat indicators.
