# National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) Volunteer Guidance

## Overview
- NPMS is a plant recording survey focusing on designated habitats to produce statistically robust data.
- Aims: map wild plant distribution, monitor habitat condition, and provide evidence to UK/national governments; provide volunteers with annual feedback.
- Partnership: BSBI, CEH, JNCC, and Plantlife.

## How the survey works
- Targets: 28 fine NPMS habitats, which can be grouped into 11 broad categories.
- Species lists: up to 30 species per habitat (selected as indicators of habitat quality); volunteers may record all species if they wish.
- Data collection scale: minimum of 5 plots per allocated kilometre square; recommended composition is 3 square plots (5x5 m) and 2 linear plots (1x25 m); most plots are 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands).
- Data entry: enter findings online at www.npms.org.uk; if online entry is not possible, post recording forms.

## Data governance and stewardship implications
- Standardization: use NPMS habitat-specific species lists and the Domin scale for abundance.
- Metadata and provenance: capture plot location, photographs, and sketches to aid relocation and interpret changes over time; GPS coordinates supported but not a replacement for field notes.
- Data lifecycle: online submission feeds annual habitat-change reports; there is an option to record additional, non-target species online for broader analyses.
- Habitat change handling: if plots change habitat type over time, assign the current appropriate NPMS habitat list at each survey; if a plot becomes non-target (e.g., scrub), continue monitoring as long as possible to capture changes or re-entry later.

## Survey timing and frequency
- Frequency: two surveys per year (late spring/early summer and late summer).
- First year: may include an initial reconnaissance visit to locate plots.
- Long-term goal: multi-year data to assess changes; if surveying multiple squares, use alternate-year visitation if needed (minimum annual survey overall).

## Plot selection and layout
- Square plots: 5x5 m (woodlands 10x10 m). Place within habitat, ideally in different NPMS habitats per square; aim to use pre-selected plots but Protocol A allows self-selection when needed.
- Protocol A (self-selecting plots): choose representative habitats, avoid overly rich or disturbed areas unless typical of the habitat; ensure plots are relocatable.
- Linear plots: 1x25 m, covering features like arable margins, waters, rock outcrops, roads, hedgerows; start at feature-gridline intersections; include ponds as linear plots if present.
- Ponds and flushes: survey as linear plots; prioritize accessibility and centre-location when multiple.

## Data recording in plots
- Core method (uniform across plots):
  - Record species present using the relevant habitat species list.
  - Assess abundance as percent cover for each species (using the Domin scale).
  - Record percentages for bare ground, bare rock/gravel, moss/lichen, and litter.
- Optional data (encouraged when possible):
  - Vegetation height classes with scoring, woodedness (dense trees/shrubs, hedgerow, scattered, none), aspect, slope, and management indicators (e.g., grazing, mowing, ditch clearance, herbicide use).
  - Grazing intensity categories (high, moderate, low) with descriptive criteria.
- Data capture aids:
  - Field sketches and up to two photos per plot to aid relocation and illustrate changes.
  - Grid references or GPS coordinates; ensure relocation cues are clearly documented.
- Recording formats:
  - Use one NPMS survey form per plot (usable for two visits if survey occurs twice in a year).
  - Online data entry preferred; if not possible, mail Forms to NPMS Volunteer Coordinator.

## Habitat types and guidance (Appendix 1)
- Provides 28 fine NPMS habitats grouped into 11 broad categories (e.g., Arable field margins, Bog and wet heath, Broadleaved woodland, Coast, Fresh water, Heathland, Lowland grassland, Marsh and Fen, Native pinewood/juniper, Rock outcrops, Upland grassland).
- Each category contains detailed descriptions and examples to aid correct habitat identification and corresponding species lists.

## Access, safety, and responsibilities
- Access: respect countryside users; country-specific codes (England/Wales Countryside Code, Scotland Outdoor Access Code, NI guidance); private land access requires permission; NPMS provides a landowner introduction letter if needed.
- Health and safety: volunteers are responsible for their own safety; check weather, avoid dangerous sites (steep slopes, cliffs, tidal areas); work with a buddy when possible; carry a mobile phone, first-aid kit, appropriate clothing.
- Safety-centric allowances: if a plot is unsafe or inaccessible, do not survey it; withdrawal is allowed and plots may be reallocated to others.

## Data submission and contact
- Primary route: enter data online at npms.org.uk after registration.
- If online submission is not possible: post forms to NPMS Volunteer Coordinator, Plantlife, Salisbury address.
- Support: contact support@npms.org.uk for technical difficulties.

## Practical tools and documentation
- Equipment: tape measure/cord (5 m intervals), corner markers, NPMS forms, clipboard, GPS/compass, camera, pencils.
- Plot relocation: always provide compass directions, permanent features, and a sketch of plot orientation to aid future relocation.
- Photos and sketches: upload guidelines specify limits (up to two photos per plot; <5 MB each) and formatting considerations.

## Data quality, discoverability, and reuse
- Consistency: standardized species lists and recording protocols improve comparability across years and sites.
- Provenance: sketches, photos, and notes create a traceable data lineage for future researchers and data users.
- Discoverability: data collected across kilometres squares and habitats contribute to national habitat-state reporting; online portal supports open data sharing with appropriate context.
