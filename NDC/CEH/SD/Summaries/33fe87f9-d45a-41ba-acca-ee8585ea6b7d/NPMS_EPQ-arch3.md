# Background

- Purpose and QA framework
  - Establishes a standard to assess the quality of the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) as a source of scientific advice and evidence fit for policy use.
  - Aligns with Government Chief Scientific Adviser's guidelines (2010), Defra Joint Code of Practice for Research (2012), and JNCC EQA Guidance notes.
  - Evidence encompasses expert opinion, data, methodologies, results, interpretations, and meta-analyses.
  - Quality assurance (QA) emphasizes “Fit for purpose” and “Right first time,” with monitoring and auditing integral to QA.

- NPMS objectives
  - Detect changes in the quality of priority habitats.
  - Understand why changes occur by identifying pressures and drivers.
  - Contribute data for UK Biodiversity Indicator C7 (Plants of the wider countryside) by measuring plant community change across key habitats.

- Application of EQA to NPMS: Publications and processes
  - Supporting publications include peer-reviewed articles, ongoing/planned papers, and internal reports.
  - Key published material: design and implementation of plant-monitoring schemes; use of citizen science; and NPMS-specific updates.
  - Internal and external reports document development work, survey design, and cross-scheme collaborations.

- Core design and implementation elements (how QA is applied)
  - Sample stratification and survey design: Developed via expert workshop; random plot selection using regular grid and linear plot lines.
  - Habitat definitions and target species: Developed with habitat experts; species selection aimed at being unbiased to drivers while suitable for volunteer engagement.
  - Field recording and volunteer involvement: Three participation levels; training and guidance provided; formal QA of field recordings not yet in place but planned.
  - Data input, verification, and governance: Online data capture with a structured spatial database; use of a species dictionary, dates, habitat terms, and controls; verification by botanical experts; data will be publicly available for independent review.
  - Analysis and reporting: Conducted by experienced quantitative ecologists using R; results disseminated via NPMS newsletters and peer-reviewed publications.
  - Risk management and review: Project overseen by a Steering Group; external peer review when necessary (e.g., survey design); outputs checked by scientists to ensure claims are evidence-based.
  - Uncertainty, quality, and limitations: Explicitly addressed in outputs; continuous feedback from the broader monitoring science community.

- Documentation, tracking, and data management
  - Comprehensive documentation of design stages; versions archived and backed up off-site under a Data Management Plan.
  - PRINCE2 project management standard followed by project managers.
  - Annex 1 provides a methodological paper outline to further address QA gaps.

- What outputs communicate about data quality
  - Outputs (newsletters, reports) include discussions of uncertainty and limitations; designed to be transparent about assumptions and data quality.
  - Stakeholder engagement and peer input are integral to ongoing evaluation of QA.

- Annex 1: Outline of a methodological paper for NPMS
  - 1. Introduction (KJW): Lack of structured observational plant monitoring; aims to compare with other taxa.
  - 2. Rationale, requirements, and aims (KJW): Details on data gaps and power to detect change (Pescott et al. 2015).
  - 3. Design (KJW/OP): Sampling framework, habitat and species selection, field methods, plot size/placement, visits, relocation and repeat surveys.
  - 4. Maximising volunteer participation (HN): Recruitment, training, support, launch and coordination.
  - 6. Discussion (all): Initial scheme evaluation, participation levels, remote areas, future plans.

- How NPMS supports policy use
  - Aims to provide timely, quality-assured evidence on habitat changes, drivers, and overall plant biodiversity trends to inform policy decisions and UK biodiversity indicators.
  - Focuses on openness of data, governance, and robust, auditable methods to strengthen trust in NPMS outputs.
