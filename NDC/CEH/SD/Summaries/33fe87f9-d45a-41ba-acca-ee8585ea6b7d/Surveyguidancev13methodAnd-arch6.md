# 1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

- The National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) is a government-supported survey focused on recording wild plants in specific habitats to learn where they grow, how they change, and to provide evidence of habitat condition to UK/national governments. Volunteers receive annual feedback on results.
- The NPMS is run by a partnership of BSBI, CEH, JNCC, and Plantlife.

## How the NPMS survey works

- Surveys track the abundance of plants within fixed plots across 28 fine NPMS habitats, which are grouped into 11 broad NPMS categories.
- For each habitat, up to 30 target species may be recorded (depending on survey level); species lists exist for both fine habitats and broad categories.
- Aimed to produce statistically robust data on UK plant community change; plots are placed to enable robust inference over time.

## Survey requirements and data submission

- Minimum requirement: survey at least 5 plots per allocated kilometre square, ideally 3 square plots and 2 linear plots; plots are usually 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands) or 1x25 m for linear plots.
- Where possible, plots should be in different NPMS habitats; each plot stays within a single habitat.
- Data entry is online at npms.org.uk; if online entry isn’t possible, you can mail in recording forms.

## Survey timing and participation

- Surveys occur twice per year: late spring/early summer and late summer.
- In the first year, a reconnaissance visit is allowed to locate plots and become familiar with the square.
- If you survey multiple squares, you may alternate years; maximum interval between visits to any single square is five years.

## Survey levels

- Wildflower Level: record a subset of species, fewer than Indicator Level.
- Indicator Level: record all species chosen to indicate habitat quality (robust data preferred).
- Inventory Level: record Indicator Level species plus all other vascular plants in the plot.

## Plot placement and selection

- Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands); aim to place 3 plots in different fine NPMS habitats per square when possible.
- Use pre-selected plot locations on your map where they match NPMS habitats; if not available, Protocol A (self-select plots) can be used.
- Self-selected plots should represent average habitat conditions, not the most species-rich or disturbed areas; mark plots for future relocation.

## Linear plots and special features

- Linear plots are 1x25 m and target habitats like arable field margins, water features, hedgerows, etc.
- Ponds/flushes are surveyed as linear plots; if only one is present, survey that feature.
- For ponds, survey from the bank and include margins and shallow areas.

## Layout, documentation, and relocation

- Document plots with sketches, photos (up to 2 per plot), and field notes to aid relocation in future years.
- GPS coordinates are optional and serve as a supplementary accuracy aid; do not replace field notes and sketches.
- Aerial imagery and pre-selected locations may help identify survey points; if accessibility or safety prevents use of pre-selected plots, employ Protocol A or adjust as needed.

## Arable margins, road verges, hedgerows, and water bodies

- Arable margins: sample 1 m into the cultivated area from the edge; avoid perennial crops and use boundary areas when needed.
- Road verges: survey only when they align with NPMS habitats; use 25x1 m plots as appropriate.
- Hedgerows: sample 25x1 m from 1 m outside hedge center, using ground flora and shrub lists.
- Water bodies: survey from the bank; 25 m along the bank with 1 m out from the water edge; exclude highly fluctuating or artificial water bodies.

## Plot setup and field method

- Equipment: tape measure, corner markers, NPMS forms, clipboard, GPS/compass, camera, pencils.
- Square plots: position with permanent features to aid relocation; photograph and sketch the plot with orientation.
- Linear plots: establish 1 m width and 25 m length using markers; include photos and plot sketch.
- Vertical plots (rocks, screes): 2 m high x 12.5 m long, positioned along the base of rock faces to minimize risk.

## Recording and data entry

- Record species present using the habitat-specific species list; survey method emphasizes thorough search while avoiding trampling un-surveyed areas.
- Abundance is recorded as percent cover per species using the Domin scale (see table reference in the guide).
- Also record: bare ground, bare rock/gravel, moss/lichen, and litter percentages.
- Optional data to record per plot: vegetation height classes, woodedness, aspect, slope, and management signs (e.g., grazing, mowing, fertilization) with detail where possible.
- Optional grazing levels are categorized as high, moderate, or low, with corresponding descriptions.
- Upload photos and sketches to the NPMS site when possible; keep notes on plot orientation and location.

## Data forms and handling

- Use one survey form per plot; forms can be reused for two visits if both visits occur in the same year.
- Data entry is online through npms.org.uk; contact support for difficulties or mail forms if needed.

## Access, rights, and safety

- Surveyors should respect countryside users and access rights; follow country-specific codes (England/Wales: Countryside Code; Scotland: Outdoor Access Code; Northern Ireland: agency guidance).
- Only access private land with permission; otherwise stay on public paths and Open Access Land where applicable.
- Health and safety: assess weather, avoid unsafe locations (steep slopes, cliffs, tidal areas), work with a buddy if possible, carry a mobile phone, first-aid kit, proper clothing, and footwear.

## Appendix 1: Habitat types

- 28 fine NPMS habitats grouped into 11 broad categories (with examples for each category).
- Examples include: Arable field margins; Bog and wet heath; Broadleaved woodland (dry deciduous woodland, hedgerows, wet woodland); Coast (various coastal habitats); Fresh water (nutrient-poor/rich lakes and ponds, rivers/streams); Heathland; Lowland grassland; Marsh and fen; Native pinewood and juniper scrub; Rock outcrops; Upland grassland.
- Domin scale for percent cover and abundance is provided (range 1–10 for cover and abundance), with specific interpretation guidelines to translate observations into comparable data across plots and years.

## Domin Scale and interpretation

- Percent cover scale ranges from 1 to 10 (e.g., 1 = very low, up to 10 = very high coverage).
- Abundance is similarly scaled to reflect the number of individuals or clumps within the plot.
- For 10x10 m plots, 1% is equivalent to 1 m x 1 m; guidance provided for estimating small and large cover within plots.
- Practical guidance for recording sparse occurrences: even a single individual may score, and larger clumps score higher based on the area they occupy.

## Summary of data goals

- Build a long-term, nationally robust data set on plant distributions, habitat conditions, and changes over time.
- Provide end users with accessible tools (dashboards, reports) that enable self-serve exploration and analysis of habitat change and plant indicators.
- Encourage consistent data collection, quality assurance, and user feedback to improve outputs and methodologies.
