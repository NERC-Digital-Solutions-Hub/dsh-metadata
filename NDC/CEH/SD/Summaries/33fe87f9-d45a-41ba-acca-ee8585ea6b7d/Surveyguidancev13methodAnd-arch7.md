# 1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

- Purpose of NPMS: a nationwide plant-monitoring survey providing statistically robust data to learn where wild plants occur, how they change, and habitat conditions; aims to deliver annual feedback and inform government evidence on the natural environment.
- Organization: partnership between BSBI, CEH, JNCC, and Plantlife; data intended for map-based dissemination and analysis.

- GIS and data objectives for specialists:
  - Create map-based data products to show spatial distribution and habitat change over time.
  - Build time-series datasets by locating and documenting fixed plots within kilometre squares.
  - Integrate multi-resolution data, capture precise locations (GPS/grid references), and support repeated relocation and trend analyses.

- Survey design and scope:
  - 28 fine NPMS habitats, combinable into 11 broad NPMS categories; up to 30 species recorded per habitat level.
  - Three survey levels: Wildflower Level (fewer species), Indicator Level (full target indicator species), Inventory Level (Indicator Level plus all vascular plants recorded).
  - Plots:
    - Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands).
    - Linear plots: 1x25 m.
  - Sampling density: minimum of 5 plots per kilometre square; aim for 3 square plots and 2 linear plots per square, with flexibility by square characteristics.
  - Plot locations: use pre-selected plot locations on provided maps when possible; if not feasible, Protocol A (self-selected plots) to ensure representative sampling.
  - Habitat assignment: assign initial NPMS habitat per plot; habitats may change over time due to management or environmental changes, which is intended to be detected.

- Data entry and reporting:
  - Enter data online at npms.org.uk for efficient annual reporting and longitudinal analyses; offline submission available by post.
  - Supporting materials: NPMS Species List, species guide with photos/descriptions, and monitoring forms (annual and downloadable).
  - Online facility for recording additional species if target lists are not observed; still useful for broad-scale analyses.

- Plot planning and relocation:
  - Plots should be in a single habitat and as relocatable as possible; include field sketches, photos, and compass directions to aid relocation in future years.
  - Pre-selected plotting aids: gridlines on maps, up to 25 pre-selected plot locations, and optional aerial imagery to identify features and habitats.
  - Protocol A (self-select plots) emphasizes representative placement (not the most species-rich areas) and documentation to ensure future relocation.

- Data collection protocol (common to all plots):
  - Record presence of species from the relevant NPMS species list.
  - Assess abundance as percent cover for each species, following the Domin scale (used to translate cover into a standardized score).
  - Record additional metrics: bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen cover.
  - Optional observations: vegetation height classes, woodedness, aspect, slope, and management signs (e.g., grazing, mowing, hedge management), including grazing intensity categories.

- Plot layout and equipment:
  - Tools: tape measures, corner markers, NPMS forms, clipboard, GPS/compass, camera, pencils.
  - Documentation: field sketches, orientation, and up to two photographs per plot to support relocation and interpretation (photos should be <5 MB; include direction if possible).
  - GPS use: supports precision in open habitats; not a replacement for field notes and sketches.

- Special habitat considerations:
  - Arable field margins: plots extend 1 m into cultivated area; avoid perennial crops.
  - Ponds/flushes: treated as linear plots; survey the most representative area with NPMS habitat dominance.
  - Hedgerows, roads, standing waters, springs, and other features have specific plotting rules to capture layered habitat diversity.

- Access, safety, and codes:
  - Respect countryside access rights and obtain permission for private land where required.
  - Follow local codes (England/Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) and use a landowner introduction letter when possible.
  - Health and safety: assess weather, safety hazards (steep slopes, cliffs, tidal areas), survey with a buddy if possible, carry a mobile phone, and wear appropriate clothing and first-aid supplies.

- Appendix 1: Habitat taxonomy (high-level)
  - 28 fine NPMS habitats, grouped into 11 broad categories, including:
    - Arable field margins
    - Bog and wet heath
    - Broadleaved woodland (including hedgerows and wet woodland)
    - Coast (saltmarsh, dunes, shingle, machair, maritime cliff)
    - Freshwater (nutrient-poor/rich lakes/ponds, rivers/streams)
    - Heathland (dry and montane)
    - Lowland grassland (dry acid, dry calcareous, neutral damp, neutral pastures/meadows)
    - Marsh and fen (acidic and base-rich fens)
    - Native pinewood and juniper scrub
    - Rock outcrops, cliffs, screes
    - Upland grassland (montane variants)

- Domin Scale (recording framework):
  - Percent cover scale from low to high (various steps mapped to 1–10).
  - Individual counts scale for presence/abundance.
  - Guidance links cover how to translate 1x1 m, 50x50 cm, and other plot areas into percentage estimates for robust cross-year comparisons.
