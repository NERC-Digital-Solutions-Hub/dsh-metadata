# National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) Volunteer Guidance

- Purpose: The NPMS recruits volunteers to record plant species in fixed habitats to generate statistically robust data on where wild plants grow, how habitats change, and to provide evidence for government and policy through habitat indicators. Volunteers receive annual feedback on results.
- Organisers: BSBI, CEH, JNCC, Plantlife.

## How the survey works

- Habitat coverage: 28 fine NPMS habitats, which can be grouped into 11 broad NPMS categories.
- Targets: For each habitat, up to 30 species may be recorded depending on the level; species lists exist for fine and broad categories.
- Plots and sampling: Fixed plots in kilometric squares are used to detect changes over time.
  - Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m for woodlands).
  - Linear plots: 1x25 m.
  - Each km square: minimum of 5 plots (aim for 3 square plots and 2 linear plots; distribution is flexible).
  - Local accessibility and safety may affect plot choice.
- Data submission: Data entered online at npms.org.uk; paper submission is available if online entry is not possible.

## Survey timing and cadence

- Visits per square: Twice per year (late spring/early summer and late summer).
- Year 1: May include a reconnaissance visit to locate plots.
- Over time: Experience should reduce time per plot as familiarity grows.

## Survey levels (data depth)

- Wildflower Level: Record a subset of species (fewer species than higher levels).
- Indicator Level: Record all indicator species (robust data).
- Inventory Level: Record indicator species plus all other vascular plants present in each plot.

## Plot selection and layout

- Plot locations: Preferably use pre-selected plot locations shown on the map if they fall within the target NPMS habitat.
- Protocol A (self-selection): If pre-selected plots aren’t suitable, volunteers may self-select representative plots within the habitat, avoiding overly species-rich areas or obvious disturbances.
- Relocation: Always mark plots with stable features, sketches, photos, and notes to aid relocation in future years (compass direction, permanent features, etc.).
- Accessibility and safety: If a plot is unsafe or inaccessible (e.g., near cliff edges, dangerous sites), do not survey there.

## How to select linear plots and other features

- Linear plots: All linear plots are 1x25 m and target features like arable margins, water bodies, hedgerows, road verges, etc.
- Plot selection method: Use maps and aerial imagery to identify intersections with gridlines; start at the intersection and follow the feature along its length.
- Ponds/flushes: Survey as linear features; if only one is present, survey that feature and count toward the minimum.
- Special habitats: Some habitats may require plots that follow contours or adapt to irregular shapes.

## Ponds, flushes, and special surveys

- Springs and flushes: Use plots that maximize the proportion of NPMS habitat within the plot (aim for 50% or more habitat representation).
- Ensure consistent recording within the habitat area when other habitats are present.

## How to lay out plots in the field

- Tools and setup: Tape or cord (5 m intervals), corner markers, NPMS forms, clipboard, GPS/compass, camera, pencils.
- Square plots: Align with stable features when possible; document southwest corner (or chosen corner) for relocation; photograph the plot and surroundings; sketch on the survey form.
- Linear plots: Mark 1 m width and 25 m length; photograph surroundings; sketch included on the form.
- Vertical plots (rock outcrops/cliffs): 2 m high x 12.5 m long along the base of the outcrop; follow safety rules.
- Relocation aids: Include field sketches and clear notes on permanent features to return to plots accurately.

## Recording in your plots

- Common method: Use the relevant NPMS habitat species list; survey efficiently by focusing on a corner first, then expanding the search.
- Abundance recording: Estimate percent cover for each species using the Domin scale.
- Additional measurements (optional but recommended): 
  - Vegetation height classes; 5 categories with a 1–3 score representing coverage.
  - Woodedness: categories describing tree/shrub density.
  - Aspect and slope (optional).
  - Management indicators (e.g., grazing, mowing, hedge management) with intensities.
- Additional notes on grazing: Level of grazing (high, moderate, low) with descriptive signs recorded.
- Other optional attributes: Additional habitat features and land management details when known.

## Recording data and submission

- Data entry: Use the NPMS online portal; register if new, or contact support if problems occur.
- Paper submission: If needed, send forms to the NPMS Volunteer Coordinator (address provided in guidance).
- Plot data: Each plot requires a dedicated survey form; the form can be used for both visits if data are collected in both rounds.

## Access rights, responsibilities, and safety

- Access: Rights vary by country within the UK; follow national codes (Countryside Code in England/Wales, Scottish Outdoor Access Code in Scotland, NI guidance in Northern Ireland).
- Permissions: In England/Wales, enter private land only with permission; use open access rights where available; landowners can be contacted using a provided NPMS letter.
- Safety: Volunteers are responsible for their own safety; check weather ahead; avoid dangerous areas; it’s advised to survey with a buddy and carry a mobile phone, first-aid kit, and appropriate clothing.

## Appendix 1: Habitat types

- There are 28 fine NPMS habitats, grouped into 11 broad categories. If you know the fine habitat, use its specific species list; if uncertain, use the broad category’s list.
- Broad categories include examples such as Arable field margins, Bog and wet heath, Broadleaved woodland, Coast, Fresh water, Heathland, Lowland grassland, Marsh and fen, Native pinewood and juniper scrub, Rock outcrops and screes, and Upland grassland.
- Each category contains detailed descriptions and representative species lists to guide sampling.

## Domin scale and interpretation

- Domin scale (1–10) used to translate observed cover or abundance into standardized scores.
- Guidance provided in the NPMS materials explains how to interpret cover for different plot sizes (e.g., 10x10 m vs 5x5 m) and how to convert observations into Domin scores.
- For larger plots, a square meter corresponds to a proportional percent cover; scoring rules differ slightly by plot size and context.
