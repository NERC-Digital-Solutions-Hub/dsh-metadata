# National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) Guidance Notes

- Aims and purpose
  - Collect statistically robust data to map where wild plants occur, how they change, and habitat conditions
  - Use plants as indicators to inform UK/national environmental state
  - Provide participants with annual feedback on survey results
  - Run by BSBI, CEH, JNCC, and Plantlife in partnership

- Data architecture and standards (relevant to Data Leaders)
  - Habitat framework: 28 fine NPMS habitats organized into 11 broad categories; use fine habitat lists when identifiable, otherwise use broad category lists
  - Indicator framework: species lists selected as habitat indicators (positive/negative) to monitor habitat quality
  - Three survey levels: Wildflower Level, Indicator Level, and Inventory Level (progression encouraged)
  - Data capture and metadata: online entry (npms.org.uk) with photos and sketches to aid relocation and interpretation; field forms and NPMS species lists provided
  - Plot documentation: fixed plots with relocation features; GPS optional; field sketches and up to two photographs per plot to support future relocation
  - Species data: track presence and percent cover using Domin scale; additional optional attributes for context

- Sampling design and coverage
  - Plot structure and sampling
    - Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodland)
    - Linear plots: 1x25 m (used for arable margins, waters edges, hedgerows, etc.)
  - Minimum sampling targets
    - Minimum of 5 plots per kilometre square, ideally 3 square plots and 2 linear plots (configurable by square)
    - Prefer plots in different NPMS habitats; each plot stays within a single habitat
    - Include ponds/flushes where accessible; ponds count toward minimums if applicable
  - Plot selection and relocation
    - Use pre-selected plot locations on provided maps, if matching NPMS habitats
    - If pre-selected plots are unsuitable, follow Protocol A (self-selected plots) in representative areas
    - Ensure plots can be relocated in future years via stable reference features
  - Habitat-specific considerations
    - Special handling for arable margins, road verges, hedgerows, standing/flowing waters, springs/flushes, and unique linear features
    - For small or irregular habitats (e.g., springs/flushes), adjust plot shape to maximize habitat proportion within the plot

- Recording and data capture protocols
  - Species presence
    - Survey within each plot to identify present species using the habitat-specific lists
    - Inventory Level includes broader vascular plant recording beyond target indicators
  - Abundance and cover
    - Estimate percent cover for each species (Domin scale)
    - Record bare ground, bare rock/gravel, moss/lichen, and litter percent cover
  - Additional contextual data (optional but encouraged)
    - Vegetation height classes; woodedness; aspect; slope; management signs (e.g., grazing, mowing, herbicides)
    - Grazing intensity (high/moderate/low) with observable indicators
  - Survey cadence and process
    - Visit plots twice per year (late spring/early summer and late summer)
    - In year 1, an initial reconnaissance visit may help locate plots
  - Data submission and formats
    - Enter data online; register with the NPMS site; offline submission via mailed forms is possible
    - One survey form per plot; the same form can cover two visits if feasible
  - Documentation to support relocation and interpretation
    - Field sketch of plot orientation and key features; compass direction; permanent features marked
    - Up to two photos per plot with noted direction
    - GPS coordinates (hand-held) support but do not replace field notes and sketches

- Access, safety, and responsibilities
  - Respect countryside users, permissions, and environmental protection
  - Access rights differ by country within the UK; private land access may require permission
  - Safety precautions: assess weather, avoid dangerous or unstable sites, work with a buddy when possible, carry a mobile phone and first-aid kit
  - NPMS provides an introductory landowner letter to assist access if needed

- Data governance, quality, and use
  - Data are intended for long-term monitoring of habitat change and plant communities
  - Emphasis on consistency, standardization, and traceability across volunteers
  - Encourage “co-ownership” of data products and collaboration within and beyond the NPMS community
  - Data gaps and issues (e.g., data scattered across regions, varying access) are expected; users should plan for data cleaning and validation
  - Annual feedback loops to participants help improve data quality and interpretation

- Appendix highlights (habitat types and measurement scales)
  - 28 fine NPMS habitats grouped into 11 broad categories (e.g., Arable field margins; Bog and wet heath; Broadleaved woodland; Coast; Fresh water; Heathland; Lowland grassland; Marsh and fen; Native pinewood and juniper scrub; Rock outcrops; Upland grassland)
  - Example habitat descriptions and characteristic species emphasize indicator-based assessment
  - Domin Scale: percent cover scoring from 1 to 10 (and related 1–10 counts for individuals) to standardize abundance estimates
  - Size and conversion references (e.g., 1% cover corresponds to 50x50 cm in a 5x5 m plot)

- Practical guidance for field operations
  - Protocols for self-selecting plots to ensure representative sampling
  - Guidelines for locating plots relative to habitat features and accessibility
  - Methods for laying out and documenting plots to maximize future relocatability
  - Special instructions for difficult habitats (ponds, springs, screes, cliffs) and for ensuring safety at all times

- Support and contact
  - Data submission support via npms.org.uk or support@npms.org.uk
