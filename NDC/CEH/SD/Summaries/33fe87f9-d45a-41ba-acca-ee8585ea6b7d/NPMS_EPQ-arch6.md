# Background

- Purpose of the policy
  - Provide a standard to assess the quality of the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) as a source of scientific advice and evidence fit for purpose.
  - Align with Government/Defra guidance and JNCC EQA guidance.
  - Define evidence as expert opinion, data, methodologies, results, interpretations, and meta-analyses.
  - Emphasize quality assurance (QA): ensuring work is fit for purpose and aims for "right first time" (mistakes eliminated).

- NPMS objectives
  - Detect changes in the quality of priority habitats.
  - Understand why changes occur (pressures and drivers).
  - Contribute data for the UK Biodiversity Indicator C7 (plants of the wider countryside) by measuring plant community change across habitats.

- Application of EQA to NPMS: key elements and processes
  - Publications and sources supporting EQA:
    - Peer-reviewed articles, including design/implementation of plant monitoring schemes.
    - Articles in preparation on interval-censored plant data and new UK plant monitoring design.
    - Other published pieces and internal and external reports detailing NPMS design and progress.
  - QA-related questions and NPMS responses:
    - Q1 (methods and publications review): design developed with statistical/botanical experts; habitat definitions peer-reviewed; volunteer-based field methods with guidance and training; structured data input and verification; publicly available data; analysis by experienced ecologists; dissemination via NPMS newsletter and journals.
    - Q2 (appropriate level of review/QA): project overseen by Steering Group; external peer review when risk warrants it (e.g., design workshops).
    - Q3 (uncertainty, quality, assumptions, limitations): outputs checked by scientists; open to critique from the monitoring community within CEH.
    - Q4 (bias avoidance): robust statistical design enabling uncertainty estimation through models.
    - Q5 (document tracking/version control): design work documented; versions archived and backed up off-site per Data Management Plan; PRINCE2 project management standards.
  - Data publication and dissemination
    - Data will be publicly available to allow independent review.
    - Results analyzed by quantitative ecologists using R.
    - Reporting conducted by a multidisciplinary project team with botany, statistics, and communication expertise.

- Governance, review, and risk management
  - NPMS oversight by a project Steering Group.
  - External peer review used as needed based on risk.
  - Uncertainty and limitations clearly communicated through checked outputs.

- Data management and version control
  - All design outputs documented; versions archived and backed up off-site.
  - Adheres to a project Data Management Plan; project managers follow PRINCE2 standards.
  - Annex 1 outlines a methodological paper covering all NPMS aspects and invites peer review to address EQA gaps.

- Annex 1: outline of methodological paper (structure and topics)
  - 1. Introduction: need for structured plant monitoring data; to compare with other taxa.
  - 2. Rationale, requirements, aims: lack of structured data; power to detect change.
  - 3. Design: consultation, sampling framework, habitat/species selection, field method, plot design, timing, and repeats.
  - 4. Maximising volunteer participation: recruitment, training, launch, coordination.
  - 6. Discussion: initial evaluation, participation levels, coverage of remote areas, and future plans.
