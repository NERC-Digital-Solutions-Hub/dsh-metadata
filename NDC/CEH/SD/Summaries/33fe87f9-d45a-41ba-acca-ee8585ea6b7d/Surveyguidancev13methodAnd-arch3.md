# National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) Guidance Notes for Volunteers

## Aim and Purpose
- Provides statistically robust data on where wild plants grow, how habitats change, and uses plants as indicators of UK environmental health.
- Delivers annual feedback on survey results to inform policy and future decisions.
- Governed by a partnership of BSBI, CEH, JNCC, and Plantlife.

## How the survey works
- Monitor abundance of plant sets within fixed plots in 28 fine NPMS habitats (grouped into 11 broad categories).
- Up to 30 target species per habitat (selected as habitat indicators; positive or negative).
- Plots (mostly 5x5 m squares; some 1x25 m lines; woodlands 10x10 m) are located to ensure statistical robustness across the UK.
- Data collected feed into annual habitat-change analysis; species lists are provided per habitat category. Volunteers may record all species if desired.

## Survey planning and plot allocation
- Minimum of 5 plots per kilometre square, in different NPMS habitats.
  - Generally 3 square plots (5x5 m) and 2 linear plots (1x25 m) per square; location and mix adapt to square characteristics.
  - Prefer plotting in distinct fine NPMS habitats; each plot remains within a single habitat.
  - Possibility to survey accessible ponds or flushes within the square.
- Plots should be selected from pre-selected locations on the provided map when possible; self-selection (Protocol A) is allowed when pre-selected plots are unavailable or inaccessible.
- Safety and access constraints may lead to deviations from pre-selected locations (e.g., safety risks, biosecurity, access restrictions).

## Data collection and recording protocol
- Levels of survey:
  - Wildflower Level: recording a subset of species.
  - Indicator Level: full set of habitat-indicator species (preferred for robustness).
  - Inventory Level: Indicator Level plus recording all other vascular plants present.
- Plot layout and relocation:
  - Square plots: generally 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands); aim to place plots parallel to stable features to aid relocation.
  - Linear plots: 1x25 m, following identifiable linear features; include ponds/flushes as linear plots when present.
  - Special habitats (e.g., rocks, cliffs) have vertical or alternative dimensions to suit safety and habitat characteristics.
  - Sketch maps and photographic records (up to 2 photos per plot) support future relocation.
- Recording methods inside plots:
  - Identify and record species present using the relevant habitat-specific species list.
  - Estimate abundance as a percentage cover for each species (using Domin scale).
  - Record bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen cover percentages.
  - Optional but encouraged: vegetation height classes, woodedness, slope/aspect, and management signs.
- Data completeness and auxiliary data:
  - Capture as much plot location information as possible (grid reference, GPS).
  - If target species are sparse, record additional species of interest online for broader-scale analyses (not feeding directly into habitat-quality indices).
- Data submission:
  - Enter data online at npms.org.uk (registration required).
  - If online submission is not possible, data can be mailed using provided NPMS forms.

## Data management, quality, and governance
- Outputs are quality-assured and presented via reports, charts, and dashboards; underlying data should be shared appropriately.
- Metadata and data provenance are critical; plots must be relocatable across years, necessitating field sketches, photos, coordinates, and permanent features noted.
- Open data considerations: public sharing of datasets can be a barrier for some existing datasets; the NPMS framework emphasizes data governance and appropriate sharing of supporting data.

## Access, rights, and safety
- Volunteers must respect countryside access rights and local regulations across the UK (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland).
- Landowner introductions can be provided via downloadable letters to aid access; volunteers should seek permission where required.
- Health and safety guidance:
  - Check weather forecasts; avoid dangerous areas; survey with a buddy when possible.
  - Carry appropriate gear, including first-aid, maps, GPS/compass, and communications.
  - Do not survey unsafe plots (steep slopes, cliffs, tidal zones, or restricted sites).

## Appendix: Habitat types (overview)
- NPMS uses 28 fine habitats within 11 broad categories (with examples such as Arable field margins; Bog and wet heath; Broadleaved woodland; Coast; Fresh water; Heathland; Lowland grassland; Marsh and Fen; Native pinewood and juniper scrub; Rock outcrops and scree; Upland grassland).
- Each broad category has detailed habitat descriptions and corresponding species lists; these guide which indicator species to record and how to classify plots.

## Domin scale and data interpretation
- Domin scale provides percentage cover categories (and comparable abundance indicators) to standardize biometric assessments across plots and years.
- Guidance explains translating plot area percentages (e.g., 1% on a 5x5 m plot corresponds to a defined footprint) into consistent scores for analysis.
