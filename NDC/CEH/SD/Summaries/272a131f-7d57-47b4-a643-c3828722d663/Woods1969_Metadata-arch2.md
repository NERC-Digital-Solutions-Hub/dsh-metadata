# Tree, vegetation and soil information from an ecological survey of semi-natural woodlands in the English Lake District, 1969

- A survey of 48 semi-natural woodlands in the English Lake District conducted in June–August 1969, with data collected from six randomly placed 20 m × 20 m plots per site (some sites with up to eight plots).
- Aimed at describing site attributes and vegetation to support site classification, classification validation, and broader woodland monitoring efforts.

## What the dataset contains

- Vegetation data
  - Vascular plants and bryophytes recorded for ground flora within 25 cm × 25 cm sampling nests across 10 nests per plot.
- Tree data
  - Species, heights, and diameters at breast height (DBH) for trees within each plot.
- Shrub data
  - Species, heights, and DBH for shrubs within plots; includes multiple stems per clump where applicable.
- Soil data
  - Soil pH measured from the top 10 cm at 5 points per plot (nest-associated), using a glass electrode pH meter.
  - Loss on ignition analysis of bulked soil samples (550°C after drying/ sieving).
- Site attributes
  - Slope, aspect, and weather observations recorded at the time of sampling.
  - Plot location details and grid-based sampling schema (nested nests within plots).
- Data structure and fields
  - Datasets include: LAKEDISTRICTWOODS_1969_PLOTS, LAKEDISTRICTWOODS_1969_SITES, LAKEDISTRICTWOODS_1969_GROUND_FLORA, LAKEDISTRICTWOODS_1969_SoilPH, plus TREE/SHRUB records.
  - Species names standardized to Latin nomenclature (updated to follow Stace, 2010 where applicable).
  - Ground flora data capture presence/absence per nest; bryophyte data captured at quadrat or nest level depending on site.
  - Plot-level and site-level identifiers (SITE_ID, PLOT) for linkage across tables.

## Sampling design and methodology

- Study area: 48 woodlands across the Lake District, including 2 outliers.
- Plot sampling: 6 randomly placed 20 m × 20 m plots per woodland (occasionally 8 plots).
- Data collection per plot
  - Trees: DBH measurements for all trees in the plot; heights of the tallest individuals recorded.
  - Shrubs: DBH and heights for shrub individuals within the plot.
  - Ground flora: 10 nests per plot, each 25 cm × 25 cm, recording presence/absence of species.
  - Bryophytes: recorded for the whole plot or nests as applicable.
  - Soils: pH measured from top 10 cm at specified nest points; bulk soil for loss on ignition analysis.
- Temporal frame: Fieldwork conducted in June–August 1969.
- Documentation and sampling grid
  - Plot locations described with site coordinates, and a map-like description of the entire plot and nest sampling scheme.

## Data management and provenance

- Origin and development
  - Emerged from the Merlewood Programme and related to the Woodland Cards and subsequent association analyses.
  - The study validated a site-classification approach using presence/absence data with quantitative vegetation features.
  - Experience informed planning for National Woodland Surveys (1971).
- Management and authorship
  - Originator details: Woodland Ecology Section, Nature Conservancy – Merlewood.
  - Key surveyors listed; data management led by Wood, C.
  - Related publications documenting methods and analyses (e.g., Bunce & Shaw, 1973; Williams & Lambert, 1959).
- Data standards and references
  - See cross-referenced works for standardized ecological survey procedures and multivariate techniques.
  - Latin names updated to modern standards (Stace, 2010) within the dataset.

## Geographic and temporal scope

- Geographic coverage: Lake District, England.
- Temporal coverage: Field data collected during June–August 1969; location coordinates provided for sites (OS grid references).

## Relation to broader monitoring and use in environmental analysis

- Aligns with standardized woodland survey approaches and supports comparative monitoring over time.
- Provides a structured dataset for classifying woodland site attributes and assessing environmental health indicators (flora, tree/shrub structure, soil chemistry).
- Useful for integrating with other datasets to enhance analytical power and to enable broader environmental health assessments.

## Practical use for Analysts Monitoring the Environment

- Verify and quality-check environmental data from a historical woodland survey to illustrate baseline conditions and site classifications.
- Use standardized methods to categorize environmental health against standards and track changes over time.
- Link site and plot-level data with soil, vegetation, and tree/shrub measurements to build composite environmental health indicators.
- Facilitate broader data access by organizing and storing the underlying data in appropriate portals; promote data reuse by providing well-documented metadata and interlinked datasets.

## Notes on related resources and access

- Related datasets and publications provide context and methodology for similar woodland surveys (e.g., Woodland Survey of Great Britain 1971; National woodland surveys 1970–72; Earth System Data publications 2015–2016).
- The dataset includes detailed site listings and plot information, enabling site-level analyses and reproducibility of the original study.
