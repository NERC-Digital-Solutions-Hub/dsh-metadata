# OVERVIEW

- This dataset comprises two closely related experiments using similar methods: a Discrimination Ability experiment (December 2021–May 2022) and a Multiple Models experiment (October 2022–April 2023), conducted at Madingley Wood, Cambridge, UK.
- Objective: study how wild birds (primarily Great tits) learn to discriminate mimetic stimuli associated with rewards and how the presence of a second model type influences protection for certain mimics.
- Organisms and site: fieldwork with Great tits, Blue tits, and occasional mice; seven feeders arranged in the wood with motion cameras and PIT-tag data loggers to track individual birds.
- Stimulus design: 3D-printed insect-based stimuli varying in mimetic similarity; stimuli formed from endpoints and intermediates along transects, with additional extrapolations in the Two-Model experiment. Stimuli labeled by combinations of insect species contributions and variant a/b/c.
- Experimental phases:
  - Habituation: birds learned to visit feeders and flip lids to access mealworms; visual lids introduced to ensure engagement.
  - Training: birds learned to avoid unrewarding wasp stimuli (V100; and A100 in 2M) by having unrewarded meals in corresponding dishes; rewarding fly stimuli (M100) provided in fly dishes.
  - Testing: introduced novel stimuli with varying mimetic accuracy; all newly introduced stimuli were rewarded to assess discrimination and learning.
- Data collection and processing:
  - Methods: motion cameras, PIT-tag readers, periodic site visits; random configuration of stimuli per feeder/session; videos cross-referenced with PIT data where possible.
  - Data handling: data cleaned and formatted in R (v4.3.2); metadata tracked to ensure reusability and cross-referencing with the PIT-tag database.
- Data quality and accessibility:
  - Quality control included plausibility checks, codes validation, and inspection of missing data.
  - Datasets are accompanied by detailed field-specific metadata and descriptions of recorded values, with a link to the stimulus design files and digital 3D images.

- Field site and study context:
  - Location: Madingley Wood, Cambridgeshire, UK (mixed deciduous habitat with resident Great tits).
  - Feeder setup: seven feeders with a 7x7 array of 30 mm dishes, enclosed in a cage, with a PIT-tag reader at the entrance; cameras capture lid manipulation and bird visits.
- Stimulus design details:
  - Stimuli derived from scanned 3D insect images, with combinations representing percentages from two endpoints; labels indicate constituent species (e.g., M25V75) and variant a/b/c representing intraspecific variation.
  - Training and testing stimuli include flies (rewarded) and wasp-related (unrewarded) exemplars, with extrapolated phenotypes included in the testing phase for discrimination assessment.
- Experimental design considerations:
  - Discrimination Ability: single model (1M) treatment during testing; assessment of accuracy across novel mimics with varying similarity to the unrewarded wasp stimulus.
  - Multiple Models: two-model (2M) treatment; testing includes stimuli combining two model end-points and extrapolations, plus a separate non-mimetic control (M100) in training.
  - Habituation, training, and testing phases structured to quantify learning rates, discrimination accuracy, and the influence of added model diversity on protection of intermediate mimics.
- Practical challenges and limitations:
  - Cross-referencing gaps: some birds did not trigger loggers or were not clearly identifiable in video, leading to incomplete bird-level linking.
  - Timing accuracy: dish-opening times estimated when video and logger data did not align perfectly.
  - Data gaps: some feeders/feeding events removed due to insufficient data or low visitation rates; extrapolations beyond observed endpoints introduce additional uncertainty.
