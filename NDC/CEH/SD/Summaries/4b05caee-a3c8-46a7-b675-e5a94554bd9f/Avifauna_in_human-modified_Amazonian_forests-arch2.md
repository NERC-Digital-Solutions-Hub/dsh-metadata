# Supporting information for Avifauna occurrence data from a longitudinal experiment in human-modified Amazonian forests affected by the 2015-16 El Niño drought and associated fires

## Overview
- Longitudinal dataset of bird occurrence (ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS_birds.csv) collected at 36 forest plots across a gradient of prior human disturbance in the Brazilian Amazon.
- Two survey periods: 2010-2011 (≈6 years before ENSO-driven fires) and 2016 (≈12 months after fires affected half the plots).
- Part of the NERC Human-Modified Tropical Forest (HTMF) programme; data and licensing information available via the referenced DOI.

## Data and scope
- Data purpose: quantify changes in bird occurrence to assess how human- and climate-induced stressors influence tropical forest biodiversity.
- Data structure: fielded observations of bird species (seen or heard) across plots and time points, with metadata on sampling and observers.
- File: ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS_birds.csv; provides standardized, longitudinal bird occurrence records.

## Study region and disturbance gradient
- Location: Santarém/Belterra/Mojuí dos Campos municipalities, Pará state, Northeastern Brazilian Amazon.
- Environment: undisturbed primary forests with typical canopy heights 30–40 m; mean annual temperature ~25°C; mean annual precipitation ~1920 mm.
- Disturbance classes (36 plots total): undisturbed (N=10), logged (N=10), logged-and-burned (N=10), secondary forests (N=6), determined from satellite canopy disturbance (1988–2010) and fire/logging assessments.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Surveys conducted at the same 36 plots in both periods.
- Three fixed sampling points per plot along a 300 m transect: 0, 150, and 300 m.
- Bird surveys: two repetitions of three 15-minute, 75 m fixed-width point counts per plot per survey period.
- Survey window: from 15 minutes before dawn to 09:30, on days with no persistent rain or strong wind.
- Data collection: recordings made with solid-state recorders; seasonal/temporal variation minimized by rotating repetitions among catchments and plots.
- Permissions: verbal permits for private properties; official permits for protected areas (SISBIO numbers provided for 2010–11 and 2016).

## Observed and metadata fields
- Data fields (as described in Table 1): CAMP_1 (2010-11, pre-El Niño) / CAMP_2 (2016, post-El Niño); Plot code; Point; Date; Time; Observer; Family; Binomial; Auditory; Visual.
- Observers include: A. Lees, B. J. W. Davi, N. G. Moura, C. Andertti, S. Dantas, among others.
- Taxonomic reference: family classification based on Piacentini et al. (2015).

## Plot-level geographic information
- Table 2 provides plot-level coordinates and context:
  - Plot identifiers (e.g., 112_12, 112_8, 112_9, 125_9, etc.)
  - Municipality (Santarém, Belterra, Mojuí dos Campos)
  - UTM X and UTM Y coordinates (UTM zone 21M)
- Coordinates enable spatial analyses and mapping of sampling effort.

## Data access and licensing
- Data access and reuse: available via the DOI https://doi.org/10.5285/4b05caee-a3c8-46a7-b675-e5a94554bd9f
- Licensing and terms of use: detailed in the same data access resource.
