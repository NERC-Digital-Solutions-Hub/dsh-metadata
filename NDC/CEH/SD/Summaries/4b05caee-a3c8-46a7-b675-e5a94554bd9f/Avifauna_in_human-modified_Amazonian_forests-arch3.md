# Supporting information for Avifauna occurrence data from a longitudinal experiment in human-modified Amazonian forests affected by the 2015-16 El Niño drought and associated fires

## Overview
- Longitudinal dataset of bird occurrence (ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS_birds.csv) from 36 forest plots across a disturbance gradient in the Brazilian Amazon.
- Comparisons between pre-El Niño (2010-11) and post-El Niño/fires (2016) to assess impacts of human disturbance and climate-induced stress on avifauna.
- Part of the NERC Human-Modified Tropical Forest (HTMF) programme; data available via the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre with a DOI for access and reuse.

## Study region and context
- Location: Santarém/Belterra/Mojuí dos Campos municipalities, Pará state, Northeastern Brazilian Amazon.
- Environment: Lowland tropical forest, primary canopies typically 30–40 m tall.
- Experimental gradient: undisturbed, logged, logged-and-burned, and secondary forests.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Plots: 36 primary forest plots distributed across disturbance classes (10 undisturbed, 10 logged, 10 logged-and-burned, 6 secondary).
- Timing: two bird surveys in the same plots; pre-El Niño (2010–11) and post-El Niño (2016), about six years apart at the first survey and ~12 months after ENSO-related fires for the second.
- Consistency: same locations and sampling techniques used across both survey periods.

## Data collection methods
- Sampling platform: 300-meter forest plots with three fixed sampling points per plot (0, 150, 300 m).
- Survey protocol: two repetitions of three 15-minute, 75-meter fixed-width point counts per plot; conducted from about dawn to 09:30 on days with no persistent rain or strong winds.
- Data capture: birds recorded by sight and/or sound; recordings made with solid-state recorders.
- Minimizing bias: systematic rotation of repetitions between catchments and plots; explicit permits obtained from landowners; compliance with Brazilian laws and permits for protected areas (SISBIO).
- Data purpose: quantify changes in bird occurrence to evaluate how human disturbance and climate-induced stress influence tropical forest biodiversity.

## Data structure and content (ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS_birds.csv)
- Key fields (sampled): CAMP_1 (2010-11 pre-El Niño) and CAMP_2 (2016 post-El Niño); Plot code; Point; Date; Time; Observer; Family; Binomial; Auditory; Visual.
- Taxonomic and observation details: familial classification, genus/species (Binomial), and indicators for auditory or visual records.
- Metadata about field personnel: list of observers (e.g., ACL = Alex Lees; BJWD = Brad Davis; NGM = Nárgila Moura; CBA = Christian Andertti; SD = Sidney Dantas).
- Data table references: includes a detailed Table 1 describing data structure.

## Geographic coordinates and plot localization
- Plot-level coordinates provided (Table 2) as UTM_X and UTM_Y in UTM zone 21M, along with municipality information.
- Example coordinates include multiple plots across Santarém, Belterra, and Mojuí-dos-Campos, enabling spatial analyses of occupancy across the disturbance gradient.

## Data provenance, licensing, and access
- Licensing and terms of use: data accessible via the DOI provided (NERC Environmental Information Data Centre); licensing details available at the data access page.
- Data provenance: explicit description of data collection methods, survey timing, and observers; permissions and legal compliance documented for private properties and protected areas.

## Governance, quality, and intended use
- Quality and standardization: standardized survey design and identical sampling regimes across years to enable robust temporal comparisons.
- Metadata richness: comprehensive metadata including survey period, plot identifiers, coordinates, observers, and recording modalities to support data reuse and verification.
- Data sharing and governance: data disclosure and sharing are integral parts of the project, with data hosted in a recognized data centre and accompanied by detailed methodological notes.

## Funding and collaboration
- Project supported by NERC HTMF programme; additional support from Darwin Initiative, EMBRAPA, CNPq, and Formas among others.
- Collaboration across multiple institutions and country partners, with roles in study design, plot selection, data collection, and analysis.
