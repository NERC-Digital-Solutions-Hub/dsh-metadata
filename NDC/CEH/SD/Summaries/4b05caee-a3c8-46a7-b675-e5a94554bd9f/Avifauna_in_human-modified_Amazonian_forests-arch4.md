# Supporting information for Avifauna occurrence data from a longitudinal experiment in human-modified Amazonian forests affected by the 2015-16 El Niño drought and associated fires

## Overview
- Longitudinal dataset ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS_birds.csv recording bird occurrence across 36 forest plots in a gradient of prior disturbance.
- Two survey periods: 2010-11 (about six years before ENSO-driven degradation) and 2016 (about 12 months after the ENSO fires affected half the plots).
- Part of the NERC Human-Modified Tropical Forest (HTMF) programme; data collected to assess how human- and climate-induced stressors influence tropical forest biodiversity.
- Data owners and contributors: Lees, Moura, França, Ferreira, Gardner, Berenguer, Chesini, Andertti, Barlow; with specific roles in study design, plot selection, data collection, and interpretation.
- Data access and licensing information available via the DOI link provided.

## Study region
- Santarém/Belterra/Mojuí dos Campos municipalities, Pará state, Northeastern Brazilian Amazon.
- Environment: mean annual temperature ~25°C; mean annual precipitation ~1920 mm; undisturbed primary forests typically 30–40 m canopy height (emergents up to ~50 m).

## Experimental design
- 36 primary forest plots categorized by disturbance: undisturbed (N=10), logged (N=10), logged-and-burned (N=10), and secondary forests (N=6).
- Plots selected from a disturbance gradient based on canopy disturbance analyses (1988–2010) and prior field assessments of fire scars and logging.
- Two survey campaigns conducted at exactly the same plots and locations in 2010–11 and 2016.
- Each plot surveyed using identical methods across both periods to enable comparison over time.

## Data collection methods
- Faunal sampling conducted along 300-m forest plots at three sampling points per plot: 0, 150, and 300 m.
- Bird records obtained via two repetitions of three 15-minute, fixed-width (75 m) point counts per plot.
- Surveys occurred from just before dawn to 09:30, on days without persistent rain or strong winds.
- Data captured with solid-state recorders; effort rotated among catchments and plots to minimize seasonal/temporal biases in vocal activity.
- Permits: verbal permissions from landowners; surveys on private lands conducted with prior authorization; protected areas surveyed under Brazilian law and SISBIO permits (SISBIO n. 24164 and 53271 for 2010-11 and 2016, respectively).

## Data structure and coordinates
- ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS_birds.csv contains field data such as:

  - Plot code, Point, Date, Time
  - Observer identifiers
  - Family, Binomial, Auditory, Visual (taxonomy and observation modality)
- Plot-level geographic coordinates are provided (Table 2) for each plot, including Municipality and UTM coordinates (UTM_X, UTM_Y) in zone 21M.
- Data structure explanation and field definitions are described in Table 1 of the supporting information.

## Potential applications and considerations
- Use to analyze how climate-induced events (El Niño) and human disturbance impact avifauna in tropical forests, with temporal (pre- vs post-event) and spatial (disturbance gradient) dimensions.
- Useful for cross-plot comparisons of bird communities and assessing detectability biases across periods and habitats.
- Users should consult the licensing terms and citations (Lees et al. 2018; Piacentini 2015 for taxonomic references) and ensure appropriate attribution.
- Data are focused on birds and rely on audio/visual detections from fixed-point counts; interpretation should consider detectability and method consistency across surveys.
