# The purpose of the data is to compare the amount of a key pheromone between two sibling species of Drosophila.

## Objective
- Quantify and compare 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-HD) levels between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia using 15 females from each species.

## Specimens and sampling
- Strains: D. simulans a2a2b inbred line (from Tsimbazaza) and D. sechellia line 13 (from Cousin Island, Seychelles).
- Female handling: virgins isolated and kept with other females for five days until extraction.
- Sample processing: females anesthetized on ice for 10 minutes prior to extraction.

## Extraction and preparation
- Extraction solvent: >99% hexane (150 μL) in a 200 μL glass vial with glass insert.
- Procedure: vortex for 2 minutes; remove female and gently evaporate hexane with nitrogen; store vials at -20°C before shipping.
- Internal standard: resuspend extracts in 50 μL of hexane containing 10 ng/mL octadecane (C18) and 10 ng/mL hexacosane (C26).

## Analytical methods
- Instrumentation: GC with flame ionization detector (Agilent 7890), DB-1 column, splitless injector at 250 °C, helium carrier gas.
- Temperature program: 50 °C (1.5 min) → 150 °C (10 °C/min) → 280 °C (4 °C/min) with a 5 min hold.
- Data processing: ChemStation; quantify 7,11-HD by peak areas relative to internal standard (C26); identification by retention time relative to C26.
- Data format: two datasets (711HDsech.csv and 711HDsim.csv), organized by ng per sample.

## Data quality and handling
- Some samples produced no detectable 7,11-HD and were excluded from analysis.
- Quantification relies on relative peak areas to the internal standard to account for extraction/injection variability.

## Data provenance and collaboration
- Rearing/extractions performed at Stephen Goodwin's lab, University of Oxford (Deniz Erezyilmaz).
- Sample shipment to University of Groningen for GC analysis by Nicolas Dubovetsky.
