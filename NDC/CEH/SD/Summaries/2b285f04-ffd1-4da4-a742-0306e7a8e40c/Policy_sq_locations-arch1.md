# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The aim is to maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity. The policy covers survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

- Current CS partners:
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology – CEH)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England (NE)
  - Welsh Government (WG)
  - The Scottish Government (SG)
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
  - Forestry Commission (FC)
  - Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
  - Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

- Why locations are confidential:
  - To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for survey integrity, environmental protection, and future access permissions.

- When and how locations may be released (precision levels):
  - Approximate release: four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence to indicate whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Precise release: six-digit grid references require pre-processing by CEH to avoid releasing precise locations; in very exceptional cases, location information may be provided externally under licence if the requester demonstrates, legally, an equal or higher level of confidentiality for their data/IP than the CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) could be used to infer square locations and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- Specific conditions of release:
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals for the project purpose.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organisational responsibilities.
  - At licence end, licensees must confirm destruction of location data in writing.
  - No data should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements.
  - A clause prevents licensees from attempting to derive precise square locations or claiming to have done so.

- Responsibilities and process:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
  - Licences must be signed by a senior official authorized to sign for the licensee organisation.
  - If approval is denied, CEH will follow the UK Act and Regulations supporting the decision.
  - CEH will provide the CS partners with an annual report detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - Practically, CEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe for CS partnership uses; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be through collaboration or paid support, negotiated case-by-case.
