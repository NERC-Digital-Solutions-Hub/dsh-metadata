# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Essential to maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future access permissions.
- Confidentiality is in the public interest; requests handled by CEH under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Access allows identifying whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references require processing by CEH to avoid direct release; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may external release be granted under licence.
- Spatial data from within squares could reveal square locations and is treated with the same exceptional release conditions as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- End-of-licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No release to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; no use to visit CS squares or to verify landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit but do not require the same high IP confidentiality criteria; users must not attempt to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Decisions on exceptional releases are made by CEH on behalf of NERC, applying policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences containing appropriate clauses; signed by authorized senior representatives of the licensee.
- If a release is denied, CEH follows Act and Regulations procedures to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; external requests are case-by-case.

## Process and engagement for potential users
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to CS location data.
- CEH involvement may be part of collaborative work or paid; terms negotiated case-by-case.
- Pre-processing analysis by CEH is used to minimise the need for releasing precise locations.
