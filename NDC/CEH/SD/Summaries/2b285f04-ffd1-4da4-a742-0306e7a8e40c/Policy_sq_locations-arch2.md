# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim and scope
  - Maximise utility of CS spatial data for public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
  - Policy relates only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners include CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Confidentiality helps preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
  - Aims to prevent compromise of the CS survey’s capacity to inform environmental policy.

- Circumstances for release and precision level
  - Access allows identification of whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
  - For precise six-digit grid references, CEH can perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing locations; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases, location information may be released under licence.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, etc.) could be used to identify square location and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to individuals with legitimate needs under the agreed project licence.
  - Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
  - At licence end, licensees must confirm data remained secure and has been destroyed.
  - No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; if in doubt, consult CEH.
  - Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP if requested.
  - Four-digit release licences are similar to six-digit, but do not require the same high IP confidentiality criteria.
  - Licences for spatial data and four-digit references include a clause preventing attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and process
  - Decisions on exceptional release are made by CEH on behalf of NERC, applying the policy principles.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with terms reflecting this policy; licences must be signed by authorized representatives.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the UK Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - CEH aims to support internal CS partner use by enabling reasonable pre-processing analyses within moderate demand; external requests are case-by-case.
  - Partner organisations and potential data users are strongly advised to consult CEH before using any data covered by this policy. CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
