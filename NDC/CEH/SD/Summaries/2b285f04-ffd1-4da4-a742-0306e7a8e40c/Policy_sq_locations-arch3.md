# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximise public benefit of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

- Current CS partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
  - Defra
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Rationale for confidentiality
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
  - Public interest justification; handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- Circumstances and precision of release
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km area) may be released under licence to indicate approximate location.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise) require pre-processing by CEH to avoid release; very exceptional cases may permit external release under licence if IP/privacy protections are equal or higher than CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares could enable square identification and thus released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- Licensing and conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and for specific projects; data must not be retained afterward.
  - End of license: written confirmation of data destruction.
  - No sharing with third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
  - License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; signed by authorized representatives.
  - If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI/EIR procedures.
  - CEH publishes an annual report detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within the CS partnership; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Partner organisations are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH may assist as part of collaboration or for a negotiated fee.

- Practical implications for users
  - Access is restricted to protect sampling integrity and landowner cooperation.
  - Governance and licensing processes govern how, when, and under what conditions location data can be used.
