Module 2: Survey of freshwater habitats

- Purpose and scope
  - A field handbook describing the procedures for the Countryside Survey 2000 freshwater module, including sampling of aquatic macro-invertebrates, River Habitat Surveys (RHS), diatoms, chironomid pupal exuviae, and associated water chemistry.
  - Emphasises standardised, repeatable methods to support long-term ecological monitoring, trend analysis, and policy-relevant outputs.

- Data types and potential products
  - Biological data:
    - Aquatic macro-invertebrates (RIVPACS-compatible sampling with 3 minutes of pond-netting plus 1 minute of manual searching, with replicates at 10% of sites).
    - Environmental data collected alongside macro-invertebrate sampling (RIVPACS data) including width, depth, substratum, velocity, and habitat features.
    - Diatoms and chironomid pupal exuviae samples for complementary water-quality indicators.
  - Habitat and physical data:
    - River Habitat Survey (RHS) data capturing 500 m reach around the sampling site, plus 10 spot-checks along the reach, and a sweep-up of the entire 500 m.
    - Channel dimensions, banktop land-use, vegetation structure, channel vegetation types, and other features (riffles, pools, bars, banks, etc.).
  - Chemical and ancillary data:
    - Water sampling for pH, conductivity, alkalinity, soluble phosphate, trace metals, major cations, and on-site filtration protocols.
  - SERCON and policy outputs:
    - SERCON component data to assess conservation value, including planform changes, recovery from channel modifications, and naturalness of riparian vegetation and banks.
  - Outputs are intended for linkage to national inventories and conservation planning (e.g., SERCON, RHS reports, RQO mapping).

- Study design and sampling framework
  - Study units and sampling frame:
    - 1 x 1 km grid squares drawn from the ITE Land Classification System; CS1990 involved 508 squares, CS2000 expands to 568 with 30 additional squares and 2 replacement Isle of Man squares.
    - Timeseries design to maintain continuity with the CS1990 dataset; re-survey of the core 508 squares; new sites added to improve country-level estimates.
  - Re-survey plan and site selection:
    - Re-survey 1990 squares where feasible; select new squares to strengthen country-specific estimates (M) and reserve MR sites as needed.
  - Field coordination and permissions:
    - IFE surveyors coordinate with ITE base labs; landowner permissions obtained prior to sampling; formal advance letters plus verbal confirmation on sampling day.
  - Data governance:
    - Emphasis on standardisation, accuracy, and reproducibility to maintain comparability across years and sites.

- Field procedures and workflow
  - Team roles and sampling sequence:
    - Team of two: Surveyor A handles River Habitat Survey and alders/disease components; Surveyor B handles macro-invertebrate sampling, diatom sampling, pupal exuviae, chemical samples, and data recording.
    - Sequential sampling at each square: macro-invertebrates first, then River Habitat Survey environmental data, with environmental samples taken upstream of macro-invertebrate sampling where possible.
  - Sampling components per square:
    - Macro-invertebrate sampling (RIVPACS) in a single 5–15 m representative reach; three minutes active sampling plus a one-minute manual search; replicate samples at 10% of sites for quality control.
    - River Habitat Survey (RHS) covering 500 m around the sampling point, centred on the macro-invertebrate site; includes alder disease and chemical sampling; 10 spot-checks along the reach.
    - Diatom sampling near the macro-invertebrate point (within 25 m, upstream if possible).
    - Chironomid pupal exuviae sampling near the macro-invertebrate site.
  - Documentation and labeling:
    - All samples labeled with land class/square number, date, sampling type, and replicate identifiers where applicable.
    - Detailed environmental data forms completed in the field (RIVPACS sample area forms, RHS forms).
  - Sample handling and fixatives:
    - Macro-invertebrate and pupal exuviae samples fixed in 10% formalin; on-site preparation includes careful labeling, packaging, and transport in protective trays.
    - Diatom and chemical samples prepared and transported following field procedures; sample containers are robust and leak-free.
  - Equipment and safety:
    - Comprehensive equipment lists (nets, pots, fixatives, containers, field sheets, safety gear); health and safety guidance, lone worker considerations, and COSHH-compliant handling of formaldehyde.
    - Personal protective measures include life jackets when necessary, gloves, barriers, protective clothing, and emergency communication (mobile or PMR).

- Data quality assurance and training
  - Accreditation and training:
    - RHS surveyors must be accredited; RHS coordinators responsible for training and accreditation (valid for three years with refresher requirements).
    - All field teams trained in macro-invertebrate, diatom, chironomid exuviae, and chemical sampling; team rotation helps maintain consistency.
  - Replication and audit:
    - Approximately 10% replicate sampling for macro-invertebrates, environmental data, diatoms, pupal exuviae, and water samples.
    - About 7% RHS surveys audited by experienced staff; inter- and intra-operator variability assessed via replicates conducted by different surveyors.
  - Data standardisation and comparability:
    - All procedures designed to produce data compatible with RIVPACS and SERCON frameworks; emphasis on standardised field methods, consistent sampling effort, and comparable environmental measurements across sites and years.

- SERCON integration and outputs
  - SERCON framework:
    - Additional SERCON component records the extent of 500 m reach affected by planform changes, channel modification, and bank/top vegetation naturalness.
    - Sections I-IX cover planform changes, recovery from straightening/deepening, and naturalness of riparian vegetation and bank plant communities.
  - Application and reporting:
    - SERCON outputs complement RHS by providing broader conservation context; results feed into national conservation assessments and aid in river management decisions.
  - Special features and impacts:
    - Sections allow noting of special or additional features of importance, including alien species, recreational pressures, and features of interest (e.g., otter spraints, kingfisher sightings), with emphasis on how these relate to conservation value.

- Permissions, safety, and field governance
  - Landowner permissions:
    - Advance letters to landowners; field visits confirmed with landowners on sampling day; access denied partials lead to adjustments or replacement sampling.
  - Safety protocols:
    - Field safety considerations include spate conditions, lone-worker protocols, life jackets, appropriate footwear, and first-aid readiness; Leptospirosis precautions and vaccination considerations.
  - Transport and handling:
    - Secure vehicle transport for samples and reagents; formaldehyde and preservatives carried in clearly labeled containers; handling protocols to mitigate spills and fumes.

- Endnotes and appendices
  - Appendices provide detailed RHS field protocols, health and safety guidance, lone worker code, and SERCON-specific instructions.
  - Includes references to national methodology, training materials, and data management standards that underpin RHS and SERCON applications.

- Overall takeaway for data support
  - The document outlines a comprehensive, standardized, and auditable data-collection framework for freshwater habitats, designed to deliver high-quality, comparable, and policy-relevant data across years and sites.
  - It emphasizes rigorous training, quality control, robust data labeling and storage, and integration with national assessment frameworks (RIVPACS and SERCON) to maximise data utility, interpretation, and reuse for stakeholders.
