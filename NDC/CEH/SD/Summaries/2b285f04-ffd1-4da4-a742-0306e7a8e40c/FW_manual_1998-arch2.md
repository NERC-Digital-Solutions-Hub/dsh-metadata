# MODULE 2: SURVEY OF FRESHWATER HABITATS

- Purpose and context
  - Provides standardized, time-series environmental data to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Field handbook for Countryside Survey 2000 Module 2 (freshwater habitats), enabling consistent data collection, quality assurance, and data sharing.

- Aims and analyst perspective
  - Create comparable datasets from established sources, enabling scrutiny of environmental health across years.
  - Standardize data handling: verify, quality assure, clean, transform, and store datasets; present outputs via reports, maps, and charts.
  - Facilitate data accessibility by storing/uploading to appropriate portals.

- Sampling framework and scope
  - Time-series focus: re-survey of previously sampled sites with consistent methodology to enable trend detection.
  - CS2000 expands the sampling frame to include new sites for country-level estimates; total impact module covers freshwater habitats across hundreds of 1 km squares (historical CS1990: 508; CS2000 expansion to around 568 squares in CS2000 context).
  - Core components within Module 2:
    - Aquatic macro-invertebrates (RIVPACS-compatible sampling)
    - River Habitat Survey (RHS; habitat assessment)
    - Diatom sampling
    - Chironomid pupal exuviae sampling (CPET-based)
    - Ecofact macrophyte survey (up to five transects per square)
  -Environmental data collection linked to RIVPACS outputs; emphasis on ground-truthing and ground data to support modelling and policy interpretation.

- Field procedures and data collection (overview)
  - Planning and coordination
    - Fieldwork conducted by joint ITE/IFE teams; landowner permissions secured; advance maps provided.
    - Each 1 km square is targeted for a freshwater habitat assessment; new and repeat sites identified and mapped.
  - Data collection and label integrity
    - Rigorous labeling and chain-of-custody for all samples; fixed/formaldehyde preservation for macro-invertebrates and exuviae; samples stored in secure containers and stacking trays.
    - Comprehensive field forms and environmental data recording forms accompany sampling; data entered with standardized formats (e.g., square numbers, NGRs, dates).
  - Macro-invertebrate sampling (RIVPACS protocol)
    - Three-minute active pond-net sampling plus one-minute manual search; repeat sampling (10% replicate sites) for quality control.
    - Sampling area defined to cover representative habitats within the 50 m RHS reach; 1 m wide across the channel for habitat data; parallel collection of diatom and exuviae samples near macro-invertebrate site.
    - Detailed labelling, fixation (10% formalin), and transport procedures to preserve sample integrity.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - Standard 500 m reach centered on macro-invertebrate site when possible; spot-checks every ~50 m along reach; transects across channel for banktop and bankface assessments.
    - Documentation of land-use within 5 m of banktop, vegetation structure within 10 m, channel vegetation types, bank profiles, and channel features.
    - SERCON integration: additional components to assess conservation value and naturalness of vegetation and banks; extensive form-based scoring.
  - Diatoms and chironomid pupal exuviae
    - Diatom samples collected within 25 m of macro-invertebrate sampling point; CPET-based pupal exuviae sampling adjacent to macro-invertebrate site.
  - Water chemistry
    - On-site field chemical sampling with on-site filtration; preservation and labelling protocols; replicate samples at a subset of sites for quality control.
  - Ecofact macrophyte survey
    - Recording floral composition along up to five river corridor transects per square.
  - Data quality and standardization
    - Strict standardization of observers, repeatability checks, replicates, inter- and intra-operator variability assessments.
    - Approximately 7% of RHS surveys audited; ten percent of flowing water sites replicated sampling; team rotations to prevent technique drift.

- Data management, interoperability, and policy relevance
  - Outputs designed for integration with policy indicators, biodiversity action plans, and habitat/river conservation frameworks.
  - Data stored and uploaded to portals (e.g., NERC/NORA CEH) to enable reuse and transparency.
  - SERCON framework provides a structured means to compare river condition and conservation value across reaches and years.

- Particular challenges and considerations for analysts
  - Increasing the value of datasets by integrating freshwater monitoring with other data (land use, remote sensing) and ensuring underlying data are accessible to others.
  - Maintaining consistency across observers and over time to ensure robust trend analysis.
  - Balancing field workload and safety with comprehensive sampling (e.g., rainfall, spate conditions; access permissions; site selection).

- Safety, permissions, and ethics
  - Adherence to NERC/Environment Agency safety guidelines; lone-worker provisions; PPE and fixed safety equipment.
  - Prior landowner permissions and formal access procedures; protocols for when access is refused or partial.
  - Use of formaldehyde and hazardous materials managed with COSHH-compliant procedures; training and accreditations required.

- Endnote: overall value for environmental monitoring
  - The document lays out a comprehensive, standardized, multi-proxy approach to freshwater habitat monitoring that supports long-term environmental health assessment, policy evaluation, and data-driven decision making.
