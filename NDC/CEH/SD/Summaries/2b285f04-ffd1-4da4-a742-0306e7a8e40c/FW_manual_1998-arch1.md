# Countryside Survey 2000. Module 2: survey of freshwater habitats. Field handbook v.2.0.

## Purpose and context
- Documents the CS2000 freshwater module field methods used to monitor changes in countryside habitats and support policy and planning.
- Builds on earlier NERC surveys (CS1990, CS1984, CS1977/78) using the ITE Land Classification System to stratify sampling.
- Aims to provide current, ground-truth data that can be combined with satellite imagery to produce land cover maps and robust timeseries for ecological assessment and governance.
- Emphasizes standardisation of field procedures, data provenance, and the linkage between field data and national/international policy frameworks (Rio, Biodiversity, Habitats Directives, etc.).

## Sampling design and scope
- CS1990: 508 1-km squares sampled across England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man; used as the baseline timeseries.
- CS2000 plan: re-survey the same 508 squares, plus 30 additional squares to improve country-unit estimates; exclude Isle of Man sites or replace with mainland equivalents as needed.
- Overall freshwater module: 435 squares targeted for at least one component (macro-invertebrates, River Habitat Survey, diatoms, chironomid pupal exuviae); includes two types of squares (1990 repeat and new 1998 squares).
- Two-tier approach planned: field surveys (ground data) plus satellite-derived land cover mapping to connect top-down and bottom-up data streams.
- Study design emphasises standardised protocols to minimise observer-related variation and maintain consistent timeseries.

## Field organization and planning
- Field teams: IFE surveyors conduct freshwater habitat surveys; ITE provides planning and liaison; six lab-based coordinators manage site logistics.
- Scheduling: visits to each 1-km square within four weeks of predicted ITE visit when feasible; landowner notifications and permission sought prior to sampling.
- Data flow: field forms, maps, site photographs, and metadata recorded and later uploaded to data portals with proper institutional metadata.
- Equipment and logistics: detailed equipment lists (sampling gear, safety gear, labeling, containers, fixatives, photography gear, transport considerations) to ensure data quality and reproducibility.
- Permissions and access: explicit processes for obtaining landowner permission; procedures for denied access and replacement sampling sites; emphasis on courteous, professional interactions.

## Methods and data collection

### Macro-invertebrate sampling (RIVPACS framework)
- Core approach: three-minute pond-net sampling plus one-minute manual search to maximize taxa collected while maintaining comparability across sites.
- Sampling area: a single benthic habitat area within the 5–15 m target, chosen to reflect representative conditions; samples fixed in 10% formalin for later laboratory analysis.
- Replication and quality control: 10% of sites include replicate macro-invertebrate samples; field teams swap roles to test intra- and inter-operator variability.
- Environmental data: simultaneous collection of environmental data for the 50 m reach around the sampling point, including substratum, width, depth, velocity, and substratum categories; detailed field forms guide data capture.
- Labelling and storage: meticulous labeling on-site; samples stored in standard containers; formalin handling procedures to ensure safety and lab integrity.

### River Habitat Survey (RHS)
- Coverage: standard 500 m reach centered on the macro-invertebrate sampling point (or reserve points if necessary); 50 m secondary reach around sampling area captured.
- Spot-checks: 10 spot-checks at roughly 50 m intervals; standardized transects (1 m across channel; 10 m across banks) to assess flow, substrate, vegetation, land-use, and channel features.
- Channel features and land-use: detailed recording of riffles, pools, bars, bedrock, embankments, bank modifications, trees, shading, banktop land-use, and vegetation structure.
- SERCON integration: RHS forms integrated with SERCON components to assess conservation value, naturalness of riparian vegetation, and bank vegetation assemblages.
- Data outputs: structured forms and spot-check key, with emphasis on repeatability and comparability across reaches and years.

### Diatoms and chironomid pupal exuviae
- Diatoms: sampling near the macro-invertebrate site when possible, with preference for upstream collection to avoid disturbance effects.
- Chironomid pupal exuviae: CPET-based approach, collecting abundant exuviae from floating debris to assess broader water quality signals; standardized five-second sweeps and labeling.
- Handling and fixation: formalin preservation and careful labeling; samples stored in consistent trays for transport.

### Water chemistry
- One chemical sample per RHS site, collected at macro-invertebrate location and filtered on site; strict cleaning and labeling protocols for bottles and filtration apparatus.
- Sample handling emphasizes avoiding contamination, proper fixation, and chain-of-custody labeling.

### Ecofact macrophyte survey
- Recording of floral composition along up to five 10 m x 2 m transects per square to capture aquatic vegetation context as an ecosystem-level attribute.

## Data quality, training, and governance
- Field staff accreditation: RHS surveyors must be accredited; RHS coordinators supervise training and accreditation with a three-year validity and refresher requirements.
- Quality control: replicates (10% of sites) and audits (approximately 7% of RHS surveys) to monitor consistency; regular swapping of component teams to prevent drift.
- Data provenance and accessibility: emphasis on traceable data sources, metadata, and discoverability by uploading datasets to portals with detailed metadata.
- Standardization and procedures: strict adherence to field manuals, with guidance for atypical circumstances documented on maps and forms to preserve data integrity.

## Safety, compliance, and field conduct
- Health and safety: formaldehyde handling protocols, PPE (gloves, barrier creams, eye protection), life jackets, appropriate clothing, and first-aid readiness.
- Lone worker and field risk management: adherence to Environment Agency lone worker practices; TWO-person field teams recommended; risk assessments for field locations and activities.
- Permissions and conduct: landowner engagement, showing identification, and following consent procedures; refusal of access triggers defined contingency steps.
- Contaminant and disease awareness: leptospirosis awareness, vaccinations considerations, and protocols for handling sewage-contaminated sites.

## End notes and appendices
- Appendices provide detailed field protocols, SERCON integration guidance, and health and safety materials; emphasis on training, accreditation, and standardized data collection to support long-term ecological assessment and policy relevance.
