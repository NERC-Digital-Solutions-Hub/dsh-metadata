# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of survey square locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Natural England (NE), Welsh Government (WG), The Scottish Government (SG), Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), Forestry Commission (FC), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).

Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permissions to survey land.
- Requestors are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

Circumstances for release and precision
- Location data can be released to help identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Precise six-digit grid references are only provided after CEH pre-processing in most cases; very exceptional circumstances may permit external release under licence if the requester demonstrates IP confidentiality needs equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data from within survey squares could identify square locations and is subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit data.

Specific release conditions
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration for specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; cannot be used to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
- Potential licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same high IP confidentiality as six-digit releases.
- License terms for spatial data and four-digit references include a clause preventing attempts to identify precise square locations.

Responsibilities and processes
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hard-copy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under relevant Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications and decision grounds.
- CEH will endeavour to provide pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe for internal CS partnership use; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential CS data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid as negotiated.
