# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Scope and Partners
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.
- Location data confidentiality is central to preserving sampling representativeness, landowner goodwill, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.

## Confidentiality Rationale
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for ongoing surveys and credible environmental policy.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and Release Framework
- Release can identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may preprocess analyses to avoid release, otherwise exceptional approval required.
- Spatial data from within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Licensing Terms and Conditions
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite; data must not be retained after project completion, and destruction must be confirmed in writing.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Providing evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP may be required.
- Four-digit grid references under licence have less stringent IP-protection criteria; users must not attempt to derive precise locations or claim to have done so.

## Responsibilities and Governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with agreed terms.
- If a release is denied, CEH will support the decision under applicable Acts and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licensing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to offer pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe for CS partnership needs; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, depending on arrangements.
