# MODULE 2: SURVEY OF FRESHWATER HABITATS

- A field handbook for Countryside Survey 2000 Module 2 outlining standardized methods to survey freshwater habitats across 435 1-km squares in the UK.
- Modules covered: aquatic macro-invertebrates, River Habitat Survey (RHS) including alder disease and chemical sampling, diatoms, chironomid pupal exuviae, plus an ecofact-type macrophyte transect.
- Key goal: generate consistent, high-quality data to monitor changes in countryside freshwater ecosystems over time and support policy and conservation instruments.

## Data Governance and Quality

- Standardization across organisations (ITE and IFE) to ensure comparability over time and between sites.
- Accreditation and training: RHS surveyors must be accredited; field teams rotate to prevent technique drift; all staff trained for macroinvertebrate, diatom, exuviae, and chemical sampling.
- Data quality controls:
  - Approximately 10% of flowing-water sites include replicate samples (macroinvertebrates, environmental data, diatoms, pupal exuviae, water chemistry).
  - About 7% of RHS surveys audited by senior staff.
  - Emphasis on complete forms, legible entries, and traceable site references.
- Data lineage and documentation:
  - Clear site identifiers (land class/square numbers), mid-site grid references, dates, sampler names, and sampling methods recorded on field forms and maps.
  - RHS data supported by a computer database; linkage to SERCON and RIVPACS outputs.

## Data Collection Framework

- Sampling design:
  - Overarching aim to update and extend timeseries from CS1990 with CS2000, including re-sampling of core 508 squares and adding 30 new squares for country-specific estimates.
  - Two square types: repeat 1990 squares and new 1998 squares (with reserve sampling points if preferred M site is dry).
  - Total sampling targets: 435 1-km squares for module components.
- Component elements:
  - Aquatic macro-invertebrate sampling using standardized pond-net methods; 3 minutes active sampling plus manual searches.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS): 500 m channel reach centered on macroinvertebrate sampling point; includes alder disease and SERCON components; field forms capture habitat features, substrate, flow, vegetation, land-use, and structural changes.
  - Diatom sampling (within 25 m upstream of macroinvertebrate site when possible).
  - Chironomid pupal exuviae sampling (CPET-based approach) from 25 m around macroinvertebrate site to monitor water quality and habitat stress.
  - Ecofact macrophyte transects recording floral composition along stream corridors.
- Site access and permissions:
  - Permissions sought from landowners; advance letters and on-site verbal confirmation; access denials trigger adaptations (abandon or re-locate sampling).
- Data capture and labeling:
  - Use of 1:10,000 and 1:50,000 OS maps; site boards and coded labels (M for macroinvertebrate, MR for reserve, D for diatoms, C for pupal exuviae) to indicate sampling points.
  - Field forms require detailed environmental data for each sampling area (e.g., NGR, grid reference, sample date, methods, and site coordinates).

## Data Management and Metadata

- Data assets and formats:
  - Primary data captured on field sheets and maps, with digital databases supporting RHS and SERCON integration (RHS database referenced as a central data asset).
  - Standardised abbreviations and data fields (e.g., station codes, land class, sample area, river name, date, sampler names, etc.) to enable cross-site comparability.
- Sample handling and chain of custody:
  - Specimens fixed in formalin (10% final) and stored in labelled containers; preservative handling procedures and containment to ensure lab safety and sample integrity.
  - Clear labeling requirements for all containers; multiple containers used only when necessary; formalin transport and storage procedures described.
- Data interoperability:
  - RHS follows Environment Agency field guidance; SERCON integration used to assess river conservation value alongside RHS physical data.
  - Data collected are designed to be compatible with RIVPACS predictive models and downstream conservation assessments.

## Data Standards and Interoperability

- Standard field procedures and measurement protocols:
  - RHS 500 m reach with 50 m spot-checks (ten spot-checks) and sweep-up for full-length assessment.
  - Channel and bank assessments rely on Wentworth substrate categories, flow-type classifications, and standardized spot-check keys.
  - Substratum assessment, banktop land-use, riparian vegetation structure, and channel vegetation types recorded with consistent categories and abbreviations.
- Documentation and forms:
  - RHS forms (Part Three) and accompanying spot-check key; additional SERCON components and inter-reach SERCON forms for comprehensive conservation assessment.
  - Appendices provide health and safety guidelines, lone-working code, and detailed field protocols for sampling and data recording.
- Data integration and outputs:
  - RHS data serve as core physical habitat information; SERCON adds a conservation-value dimension; RIVPACS data support interpretive ecological assessments and model validation.

## Risk Management, Permissions, and Safety

- Field operations:
  - Lone-worker risk management with formal safety guidance; life jackets and protective gear recommended; mobile communications maintained; buddy-system advised.
  - Safety considerations for water activity, hazardous environments, and potential exposure to formaldehyde and sewage-impacted sites.
- Permissions and access:
  - Landowner permissions required; predefined procedures for denied access and notifications to supervisors.
- Contingencies:
  - Procedures for adverse weather, spate conditions, and non-standard river sections; non-standard reaches documented with specific guidance.

## Outputs, Applications, and Implications for Data Leaders

- Data outputs:
  - Macroinvertebrate community data; River Habitat Survey results (including alder health and chemical data); Diatom and chironomid exuviae data; macrophyte transects; SERCON scores for conservation assessment.
- Strategic value:
  - The framework supports long-term data continuity and comparability across time and across institutions.
  - Rich metadata and standardized procedures facilitate data quality, governance, and reuse for policy, habitat management, and ecological research.
- Recommendations for Data Leaders:
  - Maintain rigorous data governance: preserve timeseries integrity, ensure consistent accreditation, and enforce replication for quality control.
  - Invest in metadata richness: capture complete provenance, sampling methods, site context, and chain-of-custody details.
  - Promote data interoperability: align with RIVPACS and SERCON outputs; ensure data formats support cross-project integration.
  - Strengthen access and transparency: document data lineage, provenance, and processing steps to enable reuse by policy-makers, researchers, and partners.
