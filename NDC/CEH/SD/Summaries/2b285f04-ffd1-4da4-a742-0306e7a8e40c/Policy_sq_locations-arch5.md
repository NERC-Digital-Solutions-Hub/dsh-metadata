# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Helps maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Requests managed by CEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When locations may be released (and precision levels)
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) can be released under licence to indicate general location.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require CEH processing to avoid release; only in very exceptional circumstances may external release occur under licence.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, etc.) are treated as equivalent to location data and subject to the same exceptional-access terms.
- In exceptional cases, licensees must demonstrate that their own data/IP protections are equal or higher than CS data confidentiality.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences granted for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- End of licensing period: licensee must confirm destruction of location data.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have license terms that are similar but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases; there is a clause preventing attempts to deduce exact square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Decisions on exceptional release are made by CEH on behalf of NERC, applying the policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by an authorized representative of the licensee.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report summarising access applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to offer pre-processing support for internal CS partnership use within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partner organisations and potential CS data users are advised to consult with CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
