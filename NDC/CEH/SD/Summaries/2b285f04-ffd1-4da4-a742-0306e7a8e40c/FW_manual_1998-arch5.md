# Countryside Survey 2000. Module 2: survey of freshwater habitats. Field handbook v.2.0.

- Purpose and scope
  - Field handbook for CS2000 Module 2: survey of freshwater habitats, outlining standard procedures for data collection, sample handling, and field operations.
  - Aims to produce datasets supporting national policy, biodiversity assessments, and river habitat classification, with an emphasis on comparable, repeatable field methods.

- Datasets and data products generated
  - Macro-invertebrate data collected for RIVPACS compatibility (core biological data from 1 km squares, plus replicates).
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS) data: 500 m reach surveys, including alder disease and diagnostic chemical surveys; SERCON components where applicable.
  - Diatom, chironomid pupal exuviae, and chemical data (pH, conductivity, alkalinity, soluble phosphate, trace metals, major cations).
  - Ecofact-type macrophyte transect data (up to five 10 m × 2 m river corridor transects per square).
  - Metadata embedded in field forms and labels (site codes, square numbers, land class, sampling point identifiers, replicate indicators).

- Sampling design and timeseries
  - Countryside Survey CS1990 core: 508 one-kilometre squares sampled; 361 with aquatic macro-invertebrates; 42 previously dry squares re-surveyed; 30 new squares added for country unit estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) in CS2000.
  - CS2000 repeats and extensions:
    - Re-survey all 1990 squares (except Isle of Man replacements) to maintain timeseries.
    - Add new squares (up to 30) to improve country-specific estimates.
  - Field sequencing aims to minimize seasonal variation by surveying in consistent order with 1990 where feasible.
  - Equipment and procedures standardized to maximize inter-operator comparability and reproducibility.

- Field procedures and documentation
  - Site visits planned after ITE surveys; co-ordination by six ITE lab bases; weekly/delayed progress and access-denied reporting.
  - Two-field-scriber model (Surveyor A for invertebrates/RHS; Surveyor B for RHS environmental and diatom/pupal exuviae sampling) with defined duty distribution and replicate sampling rules.
  - Sampling area definitions:
    - Macro-invertebrate sampling: single 5–15 m stream-bed area, proportionally sampling habitats; 3 minutes active netting plus 1 minute manual search.
    - Environmental data collection: environmental parameters for the entire sampling area (width, depth, substratum, velocity, etc.).
  - Sample labeling, containers, fixatives, and transport:
    - External labels with land class/square number, date, sampler names, and sample type (first/replicate); replicate labeling for 10% sample sites.
    - Use of 1.3 L pots for macro-invertebrates; 150 ml water/sample bottles; preserved in 10% formalin as fixative (or field-fixed to target 10% formalin final concentration).
    - Samples stored in grey stacking trays; careful sealing to avoid leaks; formalin-handling precautions and COSHH adherence.
  - Field forms and mapping:
    - Maps provide macro-invertebrate sampling site (M) and reserve sites (MRn); documentation includes RHS 50 m reach around M site.
    - Use of 1:10,000 and 1:50,000 OS maps for site locations and sampling plan; field data entered on RHS forms (Part Three) and associated tables.
  - Quality control and training:
    - All RHS surveyors must be accredited; training and certification procedures defined.
    - Ten percent of flowing water sites receive replicate sampling; inter- and intra-operator variability checks; approximately 7% of RHS surveys audited by experienced staff.
  - Health, safety, and permissions:
    - Permissions: landowner consents required; procedures for denied access; contact and identification requirements.
    - Safety: PPE (gloves, barrier cream, life jackets, waders), lone worker protocols, risk assessments, and COSHH for formalin.

- Data governance, quality, and interoperability
  - Emphasis on standardization across observers and surveys to ensure data compatibility with RIVPACS and other national datasets.
  - Clear provenance, including sampling approach (A/B/C methods), dates, site codes, and replicate status, to enable traceability and audit trails.
  - Documentation of limitations and context (e.g., flow types, channel features, and SERCON attributes) to support downstream interpretation and conservation scoring.
  - Data management considerations highlighted:
    - Metadata capture via field forms; consistent coding (M, MR, etc.); standardized labeling and storage.
    - Integration with national frameworks (Rio, CBD, EU directives) through standardized RHS and RIVPACS-compatible data.
    - Explicit procedures for handling non-standard or problematic sections (e.g., non-flowing sections, dry sites, or restricted access) to preserve data integrity.

- Challenges and considerations for Data Stewards
  - Incomplete understanding of user needs and priority alignment with researchers and policymakers.
  - Ensuring timely data availability while maintaining strict quality control and accreditation requirements.
  - Achieving metadata completeness and interoperability across CS1990/CS2000 datasets and future surveys.
  - Managing data across multiple systems (field forms, map-based planning, sample containers, and laboratory data) with rigorous version control and auditability.
  - Maintaining consistent data governance includes permissions, safety, and ethics across sites and teams.

- Endnotes and appendices (data governance relevance)
  - Appendices provide health and safety guidance, lone-worker protocols, and SERCON integration guidance to standardize data collection for conservation assessment.
  - RHS manual emphasizes accreditation, field training, and standardized data capture to ensure reliability of conservation indices and habitat assessments.
  - Documentation supports a robust data lifecycle: planning, field collection, labeling, transport, storage, lab processing, QA, and archival.

- Practical takeaways for a Data Steward
  - Establish and maintain a comprehensive data dictionary linking site codes, sampling methods (M, MR, M/MR), and data fields across RHS, RIVPACS, and diatom/pupal exuviae datasets.
  - Enforce strict labeling, containerization, fixative handling, and transport workflows to ensure sample integrity and traceability.
  - Ensure accessioning and versioning of field forms and maps; capture provenance for all components of the fieldwork (square history, repeat or new squares, etc.).
  - Monitor replication and auditing processes to sustain data quality across years and across teams.
  - Align data sharing plans with national policies, ensuring metadata-rich, QA-ed datasets are discoverable and reusable for governance, policy, and research.
