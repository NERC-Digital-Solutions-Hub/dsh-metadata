# Plant cover in foredunes following hurricane Irma: large scale surveys

## Overview
- Large-scale monitoring of plant cover by species in foredunes following Hurricane Irma (Oct 2017) to inform coastal ecosystem health and restoration decisions.
- Conducted across multiple sites in the Florida (Cape Canaveral) to Georgia (Tybee Island) corridor, with development gradient representation.

## Study design and scope
- Sites: up to 28 foredune sites along the coastline between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Tybee Island, Georgia.
- Timeframe: three sampling occasions – February 2018, July 2018, and January 2019.
- Experimental setup: sites selected for accessibility and to ensure a mix of development levels; sites undergoing restoration (e.g., transplantation) re-surveyed.
- Sampling structure: at each site, three transects perpendicular to the shoreline (~50 m apart) were established; along each transect, 0.5 × 0.5 m quadrats were used at 1 m intervals from the dune crest to the upper beach.
- Re-survey approach: transects at each site aimed to be located in approximately the same areas across rounds (within ~10 m).

## Data collected and variables
- Primary metrics: plant percentage cover by species, average plant cover, and species richness per transect.
- Target species: includes Uniola paniculata (mean cover provided); data also includes a comprehensive set of other species (67 additional columns for other species).
- Structure: data tied to Sampling_date, Site, Lat, Long, Transect, and Development category.
- Development categorization (broadly defined):
  - A: low development (e.g., parks; minimal development within ~1 km; small nearby development)
  - B: moderate development (no direct development within foredune/first swale; boardwalks or low-density housing nearby)
  - C: high development (buildings directly on the beach behind dune margins)
- Data collection details: transects placed in representative locations; field observers visually estimated species cover within each quadrat; total cover is the sum of individual species covers; species richness equals the number of species observed along a transect.
- Repeated measures: efforts to reposition transects in the same areas across survey rounds; notes indicate not all sites were revisited for every sampling round.

## Data quality, checks, and metadata
- Data checks: distributions of all variables screened and cross-checked against field notebooks.
- Coding: NA indicates not applicable for a given site-variable combination; 0 indicates absence of a species or zero species richness.
- Data documentation: dataset includes file formats (Excel, CSV) and dataset field descriptions (header and description) to support interpretability and reuse.
- Geographic and temporal metadata: explicit latitude/longitude, site names, transect numbers, and precise sampling dates.

## Data formats and structure
- File formats: Excel and CSV.
- Dataset fields and descriptions: includes Sampling_date, Site, Lat, Long, Transect, Development (A/B/C with definitions), Number of species, Total.cover, Uniola_paniculata (mean cover), and extensive species columns (the dataset contains 67 additional species’ covers beyond Uniola paniculata).

## Relevance for environmental health monitoring and policy
- Provides actionable metrics (species-specific and total plant cover, species richness) across a disturbance event and post-disturbance restoration contexts.
- Enables assessment of how dune vegetation responds across development gradients and over time, informing policy decisions on coastal protection, restoration prioritization, and monitoring frameworks.
- Rich metadata (location, timing, transect design, development category) supports data integration, comparability, and longitudinal analyses, while explicit data checks enhance reliability for policy reviews.
- While data governance and sharing considerations are general challenges for monitoring datasets, this entry demonstrates a structured approach to data collection, quality assurance, and clear documentation to support transparent reporting and decision-making.
