# Plant cover in foredunes following hurricane Irma: large scale surveys

- Overview
  - Multi-site field dataset examining plant cover in foredunes following Hurricane Irma (2017).
  - Data collected on up to 28 sites across Florida and Georgia (Cape Canaveral to Tybee Island).
  - Three sampling occasions: February 2018, July 2018, January 2019.
  - Key variables: plant percent cover by species, average plant cover, species richness; total cover and species-specific columns also included (Uniola paniculata mean cover and 67 additional species columns).

- Study design and scope
  - Sites chosen in February 2018 based on accessibility and a mix of coastal development levels; some active restoration sites re-surveyed.
  - Field surveys conducted in the foredune area along transects perpendicular to the shoreline.
  - Three transects per site, with quadrats positioned at ~50 m intervals along transects.
  - Re-surveys aimed to sample approximately the same areas (within ~10 m) across timepoints.

- Data collection methods and variables
  - Sampling units: 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats along each transect.
  - At 1 m intervals along each transect, estimated visually the percentage cover of each plant species; total cover is the sum across species.
  - Species richness defined as the number of species recorded along a transect.
  - For repeated surveys, transects 1–3 remained in roughly the same locations.
  - Primary recorded variables: Sampling_date, Site, Lat, Long, Transect, Development (A, B, C with defined criteria).

- Data quality, provenance, and documentation
  - Data checks included screening distributions of variables and cross-checking with field notebooks.
  - Encoding: NA indicates not applicable; 0 indicates absence of a species or zero species richness.
  - File formats available: Excel and CSV.
  - Documentation includes clear field descriptions for dataset variables (e.g., Sampling_date, Site, Lat/Long, Transect, Development categories).

- Spatial and temporal coverage
  - Geographic scope: foredune observations between Cape Canaveral (Florida) and Tybee Island (Georgia), USA.
  - Temporal scope: three observation periods spanning roughly February 2018 to January 2019, following Hurricane Irma (October 2017).

- Development context and site classification
  - Development category definitions:
    - A: low development (minimal development within ~1 km of foredune toe; parks, minor development nearby).
    - B: moderate development (no direct foredune or first swale development; boardwalks or low-density housing on higher dune ridges).
    - C: high development (beachfront buildings directly behind dune margins).

- Staff and data stewardship
  - Staff responsible: John Griffin, Matthew Joyce.

- Data use and implications for data leaders
  - Provides a post-storm baseline for dune plant cover and species composition across development contexts.
  - Enables cross-site comparisons and assessments of recovery trajectories over time.
  - Supports data ownership and collaboration through a structured, standardized dataset with consistent metadata and explicit variable definitions.
  - Highlights practical data management considerations: multi-timepoint sampling, transect-level aggregation, and clear handling of missing or non-applicable data.

- Limitations and considerations
  - Up to 28 sites; only three sampling periods; results are contingent on spatial distribution of sites and development categories.
  - Field estimation of cover is visual and may introduce observer bias; data checks mitigate but do not eliminate this.
