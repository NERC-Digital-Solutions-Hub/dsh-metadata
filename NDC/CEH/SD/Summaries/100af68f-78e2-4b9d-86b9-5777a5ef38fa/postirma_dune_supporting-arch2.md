# Plant cover in foredunes following hurricane Irma: large scale surveys

## Study purpose and scope
- Dataset detailing plant cover by species in foredunes after Hurricane Irma, intended to support monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Focuses on standardized, comparable outputs (e.g., species cover, species richness) to assess vegetation condition and recovery.

## Location, timing, and scope
- Location: foredune areas from Cape Canaveral, Florida to Tybee Island, Georgia, USA.
- Event context: Hurricane Irma impacted the coastline in October 2017.
- Sampling rounds: February 2018, July 2018, January 2019.
- Staff: John Griffin, Matthew Joyce.

## Sampling design and sites
- Up to 28 sites along the study coastline; three transects per site.
- Transects positioned perpendicular to the shoreline at approximately 50 m intervals.
- Re-surveys included at sites undergoing active restoration (e.g., transplantation).

## Field methods and observations
- Within each transect, observations at 1 m intervals from the foredune crest to the upper beach.
- Within each 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrat, visually estimated percentage cover for each plant species.
- Total cover per quadrat equals the sum of all species’ covers; species richness equals the number of species observed along a transect.
- Revisit consistency: transects 1–3 were located in approximately the same areas (within about 10 m) across survey rounds.

## Variables observed
- Primary metrics: plant percentage cover by species, average plant cover, species richness.
- Notable species data: Uniola paniculata mean cover along each transect.
- Data structure includes 67 additional species-specific columns beyond Uniola paniculata.

## Data processing, quality assurance, and documentation
- Data checked for unusual values; NA indicates not applicable, and 0 indicates absence of a species or zero richness.
- Data stored and formatted in Excel and CSV files; field descriptions and headers documented (e.g., Sampling_date, Site, Lat, Long, Transect, Development).

## Dataset fields and development context
- Key fields: sampling_date, site, latitude, longitude, transect, development category.
- Development categories (broadly defined): A = low development (e.g., parks with little nearby development), B = moderate development (boardwalks or low-density housing nearby), C = high development (buildings directly on the beach behind dune margins).

## Access, reuse, and data stewardship
- Emphasis on quality assurance, standardised methods, and the storage/upload of datasets to appropriate portals.
- The dataset is intended to be combinable with other environmental data to enhance the value and enable broader access to underlying data used for final outputs.
