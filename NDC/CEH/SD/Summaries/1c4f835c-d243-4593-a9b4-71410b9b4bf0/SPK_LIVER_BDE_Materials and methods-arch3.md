# PBDE concentrations in livers of sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) from Britain: sampling, determination, and statistical analyses

- Overview
  - Aim: Examine PBDE concentrations in sparrowhawk livers to understand exposure across time and space, and to identify factors that explain variation in liver PBDEs and liver characteristics.
  - Source and scope: Archived livers from dead sparrowhawks collected across Britain (1998–2009; central England, east of Wales border within 250 km) for a study designed to minimize temporal and spatial confounding.

- Sampling and sample selection
  - Data provenance: Dead birds collected by volunteers and submitted to the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme; recorded provenance, collection date, age, sex, body weight, and visually assessed body condition.
  - Tissue collection and limitations: Various body tissues weighed and archived; whole liver/body weights not available for all birds due to trauma, scavenging, or non-recorded weights from taxidermists.
  - Stratified sampling: Selection aimed to be representative of eight groups defined by sex (male/female), age (adult/juvenile), and body condition (starved/non-starved); total analyzed birds = 59 (group sizes 5–11).
  - Temporal/spatial restriction rationale: Focused on 1998–2009, central England, within 250 km of the Welsh border to reduce confounding variation.
  - Missing data: Liver weights missing for some individuals; potential impacts on analyses acknowledged.

- Determination of PBDE concentrations in livers
  - Sample processing: About 1 g of liver homogenized; lipid content measured gravimetrically.
  - Analytical method: GC-MS analysis of a 30-congener PBDE suite (tri-Octa BDEs listed; BDE209 not quantified due to method limitations).
  - Instrumental parameters: Specific column and calibration setup; seven PBDE standards used for quantification.
  - Quality assurance: Eight procedural blanks per batch; blank-corrected sample concentrations; recoveries for 13 C12-labelled congeners (74.4–88.2%) used to adjust data; QC standard (five PBDEs across 2.5–250 pg/µl) analyzed with unknowns; batches accepted if QC within ±10% of expected values.
  - Detection limits: Instrument LoDs ranged (2.5 pg/µl for several congeners; 0.27–0.54 ng/g wet weight in liver); below-LoD values handled in analysis.

- Statistical analyses
  - Software and approach: Analyses conducted in Minitab 16.0; general linear models (GLM) used to test effects of age, sex, body condition, and breeding status on PBDE concentrations and liver characteristics (liver mass, liver % lipid).
  - Handling complex effects: Due to possible interactions, analyses of age and body condition on liver PBDEs performed separately for males and females.
  - Data treatment: PBDE concentrations log-transformed; liver lipid percentage arcsine square-root transformed to satisfy GLM assumptions of equal variance and normal residuals.
  - Censoring: For congeners with some nondetects, values below LoD were interpolated when the percentage of nondetects was less than 80%; this followed referenced methods to handle nondetect data.

- Data quality, metadata, and governance considerations (relevant to monitoring frameworks)
  - Importance of provenance and metadata: Detailed recording of collection date, age, sex, and body condition supported stratified analyses and interpretation.
  - QA/QC emphasis: Rigorous blanks, recoveries, and QC standards ensured data integrity; clear criteria for batch validity.
  - Handling of nondetects and transformation: Transparent approach to censored data and appropriate data transformations to meet statistical assumptions.
  - Limitations impacting monitoring: Missing liver weights for some specimens, exclusion of BDE209 quantification due to methodological constraints, and potential residual confounding despite stratification.
  - Data usability considerations: The study demonstrates the need for complete, well-documented metadata and robust QA to enable reliable interpretation for policy-relevant monitoring.

- Implications for future monitoring frameworks
  - Design recommendations: Ensure complete body weight data; consider including BDE209 with an appropriate analytical method; maintain stratified sampling to capture key biological modifiers (sex, age, condition).
  - Data governance: Maintain detailed provenance, QA procedures, and transparent handling of nondetects to support data sharing and policy use.
  - Analysis and reporting: Use GLMs or equivalent that account for interactions among biological factors; clearly document data transformations and censorship handling; provide accessible summaries (reports/dashboards) for decision-makers.
