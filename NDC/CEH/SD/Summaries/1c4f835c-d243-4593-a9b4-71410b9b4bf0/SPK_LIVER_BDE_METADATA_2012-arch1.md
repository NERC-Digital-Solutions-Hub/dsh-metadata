# Bird Data Variables and Measurements: Post-Mortem Data and BDE Concentrations

## Overview
- A dataset describing post-mortem bird measurements and contaminant concentrations.
- Key identifiers and variables include: CEH_BIRD_CODE (unique ID on receipt), SEX, AGE_CLASS, BODY_CONDITION, physical measurements, timing of death, and BDE concentrations.
- BDEs measured: BDE47, BDE99, BDE100, BDE138, BDE153, BDE154, BDE183, plus TOTAL BDEs (ng/g lipid weight).
- Units:
  - Weights (BOGY_WEIGHT_G, LIVER_WT_G): grams (g)
  - PERCENT_LIPID_IN_LIVER: percent (%)
  - BDE concentrations: nanograms per gram lipid weight (ng/g lipid weight)
- Notable data handling:
  - Not detected (ND) values for BDEs are assigned a value below the limit of detection (LoD) using the method described by Hesel.
  - Juveniles are defined as birds hatched in the current or previous calendar year.
  - STARVED body condition indicates complete lack of fat deposits or minimal fat around the heart.

## Data Usage Considerations for Analysts
- Data quality and accessibility:
  - ND handling uses Hesel method; consider this when imputing or modeling non-detects.
  - Measurements are reported per bird and include both biological (sex, age, condition) and chemical (BDEs) data, enabling exposure and risk analyses.
- Analytical options:
  - Compare BDEs by age class, sex, or body condition.
  - Normalize BDE concentrations by liver lipid percentage if exploring exposure relative to lipid content.
  - Temporal and seasonal context available via MONTH_DIED and YEAR_BIRD_DIED.
- Potential challenges:
  - Missing or ND values in several variables may require careful imputation or model handling.
  - Data are tied to a specific observational context (post-mortem birds), which may affect generalizability to living populations.
  - Juxtaposition of multiple BDE congeners (and TOTAL) suggests multivariate exposure analyses; be mindful of inter-congener correlations.
  
## Practical Notes for Analysis
- Ensure consistent interpretation of units (ng/g lipid weight) across all BDE variables.
- When using MONTH_DIED, categorize into the two seasonal windows (April–Sept, Oct–Mar) as defined.
- Use YEAR_BIRD_DIED alongside MONTH_DIED to explore temporal trends or seasonal effects in contamination.
- Consider the biological condition variable (BODY_CONDITION) when assessing relationships between health status and contaminant burden.
