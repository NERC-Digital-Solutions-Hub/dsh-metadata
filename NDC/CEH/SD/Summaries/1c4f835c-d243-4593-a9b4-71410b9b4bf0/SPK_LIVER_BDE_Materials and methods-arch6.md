# PBDE concentrations in livers of sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) from Britain

## Objective and study design
- Investigates concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in sparrowhawk livers.
- Samples archived from the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) spanning 1998–2009, focused on central England within 250 km of the Welsh border to minimise temporal and spatial confounding.
- Bird selection stratified into eight groups by sex (male/female), age (adult/juvenile), and body condition (starved/non-starved); total analyzed birds = 59.
- Aims to relate PBDE levels to biological factors and liver traits, while enabling cross-group comparisons.

## Sample collection and specimen details
- Dead sparrowhawks were collected nationwide by volunteers; provenance, date, age, sex, body weight, and body condition were recorded; necropsies performed to determine putative causes of death.
- Whole livers were not always obtained for all birds due to trauma, scavenging, or incomplete records from taxidermists.
- Archived livers were selected to limit variation and errors related to collection timing and location.

## PBDE measurement in liver tissue
- Approximately 1 g of liver was sampled per bird, homogenised, and analysed.
- Extraction, cleanup, and gravimetric determination of lipid content followed established methods; liver extracts were analysed by GC-MS.
- Targeted 30 PBDE congeners (tri-Octa BDEs listed: 17, 28, 32, 35, 37, 47, 49, 51, 66, 71, 75, 77, 85, 99, 100, 118, 119, 126, 128, 138, 153, 154, 166, 183, 190, 196, 197, 201, 202, 203).
- BDE-209 was not quantified due to limitations of the method used.
- Instrument detection limits (LoD) varied by congener; liver LoDs approximately 0.27–0.54 ng/g wet weight.
- Eight procedural blanks per batch were used; sample concentrations were blank-corrected.
- Recovery corrections applied using 13 C12-labelled congeners (recovery 74.4–88.2% range); a QC standard was analysed with unknowns to monitor performance; batches were considered acceptable if QC values were within ±10% of expected.

## Data processing and quality control
- Lipid-normalised PBDE data and liver characteristics were prepared for statistical analysis.
- Values below the LoD were treated with a method aligned with Hesel (1990, 2006) when applicable (i.e., if <80% of values were below LoD for a given congener, below-LoD values were interpolated; otherwise treated as non-detect).
- The dataset included both congener-specific concentrations and summary measures such as ΣPBDEs and liver lipid content.

## Statistical analyses
- Analyses conducted in Minitab 16.0.
- General linear models (GLMs) used to test whether age, sex, body condition, and breeding status explained variation in PBDE concentrations and liver characteristics (e.g., liver mass, liver % lipid).
- Given possible triple interactions, analyses of age and body condition on liver BDE concentrations were performed separately for males and females.
- PBDE concentrations and % lipid data were log- and arcsine-square-root transformed, respectively, to satisfy GLM assumptions (homogeneity of variance and normality of residuals).
- Handling of values below LoD adhered to the approach described above.

## Key considerations and limitations
- Some liver data (e.g., body weight, complete body condition details) may be missing or incomplete due to collection and preservation issues.
- BDE209 was not quantified, limiting full comparison with certain PBDE mixtures.
- The study focuses on a defined geographic and temporal window to reduce confounding factors, which may affect generalizability to other regions or time periods.
- Data processing and imputation decisions for non-detects can influence resulting concentration estimates and subsequent interpretations.
