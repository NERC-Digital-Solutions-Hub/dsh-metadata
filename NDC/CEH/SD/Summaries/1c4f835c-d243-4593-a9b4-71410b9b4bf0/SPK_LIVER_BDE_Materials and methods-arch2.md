# PBDE concentrations in livers of sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) from Britain

## Overview
- This study reports on the determination of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) concentrations in liver tissue from sparrowhawks collected across Britain.
- Part of the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS), with the aim of monitoring environmental chemical exposure in top predators to support long-term environmental health assessments.
- Samples from 1998–2009, central England to within 250 km of the Welsh border, were selected to minimise temporal and spatial variation and to align with prior findings that female exposure was relatively constant over this period and region.
- Birds were stratified into eight groups by sex (male/female), age (adult/juvenile), and body condition (starved/non-starved); total analyzed birds = 59.

## Methods

### Sample collection and selection
- Dead sparrowhawks were submitted by volunteers to PBMS.
- For each bird, provenance, collection date, age, sex, body weight, and body condition were recorded; a necropsy determined putative cause of death.
- Tissues were collected, weighed, and archived at -20°C.
- Whole liver weights were not available for all birds due to trauma, scavenging, or non-recorded weights from some taxidermist-supplied specimens.

### PBDE determination in livers
- About 1 g of liver was sampled from different areas to obtain a representative portion, homogenised, and weighed.
- Extraction, cleanup, and lipid content determination followed established protocols.
- PBDEs were measured by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) targeting 30 tri–octa BDE congeners (17, 28, 32, 35, 37, 47, 49, 51, 66, 71, 75, 77, 85, 99, 100, 118, 119, 126, 128, 138, 153, 154, 166, 183, 190, 196, 197, 201, 202, 203); BDE209 was not quantified due to methodological limitations.
- Instrument detection limits (LoD) ranged from 2.5 pg/µl (various tri–hexa congeners) to 5 pg/µl (Octa BDEs); corresponding average liver LoDs were 0.27–0.54 ng/g wet weight.
- Eight procedural blanks were included; sample concentrations were blank-corrected.
- Recoveries for 13 C12-labeled congeners (28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183) ranged from 74.4% to 88.2% and were recovery-corrected.
- A QC standard (encompassing tri–hepta homologue groups) was analyzed with unknowns; batches were deemed acceptable if QC values were within ±10% of expected values.

### Statistical analyses
- Analyses performed with Minitab 16.0.
- General linear models (GLM) were used to test whether age, sex, body condition, and breeding status explained variation in concentrations of individual PBDE congeners, total ΣPBDEs, or liver characteristics (e.g., liver mass, liver % lipid).
- Given potential triple interactions among age, sex, and body condition, age and body condition effects on liver PBDEs were examined separately for males and females.
- PBDE concentrations were log-transformed; liver lipid percentages were arcsine square-root transformed to meet GLM assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normal residuals.
- Values below the LoD were handled with appropriate statistical treatment; when congeners had <80% of values above LoD, below-LoD values were interpolated using methods described in the cited Hesel references.

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations for monitoring
- Some livers lacked complete body weight data, and not all livers could be weighed due to sample condition, which may affect certain mass- or condition-related analyses.
- BDE209 was not quantified due to methodological constraints, potentially underrepresenting total PBDE burden.
- The rigorous QA/QC procedures (blanks, recoveries, QC standards, and ±10% QC agreement) support data reliability for monitoring trends.
- Regional and temporal stratification was chosen to minimize confounding factors, aligning with prior work that suggests relatively stable female exposure across the studied interval and area.

## Implications for environmental monitoring and data sharing
- Demonstrates a standardised workflow for integrating predator biomonitoring with chemical residue analysis, suitable for long-term trend assessment and cross-study comparability.
- Emphasizes archiving tissues at -20°C, traceable provenance, and systematic data processing to enhance reproducibility and potential data sharing.
- Highlights ongoing challenges in maximizing dataset value by enabling access to underlying data and integrating results with broader environmental datasets.
