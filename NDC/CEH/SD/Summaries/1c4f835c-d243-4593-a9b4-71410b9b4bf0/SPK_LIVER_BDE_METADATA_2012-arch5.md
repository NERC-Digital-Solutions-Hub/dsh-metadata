# Bird Health and BDE Contaminant Dataset Variables

## Overview
- The dataset records per-bird observations including unique identifiers, demographics, body condition, post-mmortem measurements, and contaminant concentrations.
- Key measurements include liver weight, body weight at post-mortem, percent lipid in liver, and concentrations of several BDE congeners (BDE47, BDE99, BDE100, BDE138, BDE153, BDE154, BDE183) plus total BDEs.
- Units are standardized: weights in grams (g), BDE concentrations in ng/g lipid weight, and lipid percentage in percent (%).
- Temporal data include MONTH_DIED (seasonal category: April–Sept or Oct–Mar) and YEAR_BIRD_DIED.
- Not-detected (ND) values are substituted with a value below the limit of detection (LoD) using the Hesel method.
- Metadata fields include explanations, units, and notes for each variable, facilitating data interpretation and reuse.

## Data Quality and Governance Considerations for Data Stewards
- metadata completeness
  - Ensure every variable has EXPLANATION, UNITS, and NOTES populated and kept up to date
- standardization and interoperability
  - Enforce consistent variable naming, unit definitions, and category codes (e.g., Male/Female, Adult/Juvenile)
  - Maintain controlled vocabularies for SEX and AGE_CLASS
- data validation and integrity
  - Validate numeric fields (BOGY_WEIGHT_G, LIVER_WT_G, PERCENT_LIPID_IN_LIVER, BDE concentrations) for plausible ranges
  - Validate categorical fields (MONTH_DIED categories, SEX, AGE_CLASS) against allowed values
- ND handling and documentation
  - Clearly document the method for substituting ND values (Hesel) and ensure LoD is described in metadata
- provenance and versioning
  - Track data sources, methods for post-mortem measurements, and analytical methods for BDEs
  - Maintain change logs and dataset versioning to reflect updates or corrections
- data sharing and access
  - Include data usage notes, embargo considerations, and update frequency
- challenges to anticipate
  - Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities
  - Delays in obtaining data from contributors
  - Variation across systems and formats requiring interoperability solutions
  - Handling large datasets and legacy/databases requiring bespoke pipelines
  - Managing data where older databases necessitate non-interoperable approaches

## Practical Recommendations for Data Stewards
- Create and maintain a concise data dictionary aligned with this dataset, detailing each variable, its valid values, units, and data quality notes.
- Implement automated validation checks during data ingestion to flag missing, out-of-range, or inconsistent values.
- Document the ND-to-LoD substitution method prominently in metadata and ensure downstream users understand how ND values were derived.
- Standardize data submission templates to minimize variability across data sources and systems.
- Include data provenance information and update schedules to support discovery, reuse, and reproducibility.
