# PBDE concentrations in livers of sparrowhawks

## Spatial and temporal sampling design
- Archived liver samples from dead sparrowhawks collected across Britain, focused on central England, directly east and within 250 km of the Welsh border (1998–2009) to minimise temporal and spatial variation.
- Sampling aimed to represent eight groups defined by sex (male/female), age (adult/juvenile), and body condition (starved/non-starved); group sizes ranged 5–11, totaling 59 birds.

## Sample provenance and metadata
- For each bird, records included provenance, collection date, age, sex, body weight, and body condition (six-point visual scale).
- Whole liver weights were not available for all birds due to damage or non-recorded weights from taxidermists.

## Laboratory analysis and QA
- About 1 g of liver was sampled per bird, homogenised, extracted, and lipid content measured.
- PBDE analysis performed by GC-MS with a 30 m CPSIL-8 CB column; targeted 30 tri-Octa PBDE congeners (excludes BDE209 due to methodological limitations).
- Instrument detection limits (LoD) varied by congener (0.27–0.54 ng/g wet weight as average LoD); eight procedural blanks used for blank correction.
- Recoveries for labeled internal standards (13 C12‑labeled congeners) ranged 74.4–88.2% and were used to correct concentrations.
- A quality control (QC) standard comprising five PBDEs was run in each batch; batches accepted only if QC concentrations were within ±10% of expected values.

## Data handling and treatment of nondetects
- PBDE concentrations and liver lipid data were log- and arcsine-square-root transformed, respectively, to meet GLM assumptions.
- For congeners with many nondetects, values below LoD were interpolated per Hesel (1990, 2006) guidelines when less than 80% of samples were nondetects; analyses otherwise accounted for nondetects accordingly.

## Statistical analyses
- Analyses conducted in Minitab 16.0 using General Linear Models (GLM) to test effects of age, sex, body condition, and breeding status on individual PBDE congeners, total PBDEs, and liver characteristics (liver mass, % lipid).
- Given potential complex interactions among body condition, age, and sex, age and body condition effects on liver BDE concentrations were analyzed separately for males and females.
- Data handling included log-transformations for PBDEs and lodging nondetects via interpolation where appropriate.

## Additional context
- The study builds on prior work and standard methodologies for PBDE analysis and handling below-detection data, with references to Crosse et al. (2012a, 2012b) and Helsel (1990, 2006).
