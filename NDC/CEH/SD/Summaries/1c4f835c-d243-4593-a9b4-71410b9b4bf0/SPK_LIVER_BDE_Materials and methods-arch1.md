# PBDE concentrations in livers of sparrowhawks

## Study design and sample collection
- Archived livers from dead sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) collected across Britain, with a focus on central England, east of Wales border, 1998–2009.
- Sample selection aimed to minimise temporal and spatial variation; prior work suggested female exposure was largely constant over time/region.
- Birds stratified into eight groups by sex (male/female), age (adult/juvenile), and body condition (starved/non-starved); group sizes ranged from 5 to 11, total analyzed birds = 59.
- Juveniles defined as birds hatched in the current or previous calendar year; starved birds had little or no measurable fat at post-mortem.
- Not all carcasses yielded complete data (e.g., whole liver/body weights sometimes missing due to trauma, scavenging, or non-recorded weights from taxidermists).

## Laboratory analyses
- Liver sampling: ~1 g of liver taken from multiple parts to obtain a representative sample; tissues homogenised and weighed, then lipid content measured gravimetrically.
- PBDE analysis: GC-MS with a 30 m CPSIL-8 CB column; analyzed for 30 PBDE congeners (tri-Octa BDEs listed: 17, 28, 32, 35, 37, 47, 49, 51, 66, 71, 75, 77, 85, 99, 100, 118, 119, 126, 128, 138, 153, 154, 166, 183, 190, 196, 197, 201, 202, 203); BDE209 not quantified due to method limitations.
- Detection and QA: Instrument LoD ranged from 2.5 pg/µL (various groups) with average liver LoDs of 0.27–0.54 ng/g wet weight; eight procedural blanks per batch; blank-corrected sample concentrations.
- Recovery and QC: Mean recoveries for 13 C-12 labelled congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 ranged 74.4–88.2%; concentrations recovery-corrected as described; QC standard (covering tri-hepta homologues) analyzed with unknowns; batches accepted if QC values were within ±10% of expected values.

## Data processing and statistics
- Software: Minitab 16.0.
- Statistical models: General linear models (GLM) used to test whether age, sex, body condition, and breeding status explained variation in individual PBDEs, sum of PBDEs (ΣPBDEs), and liver characteristics (liver mass, % lipid).
- Stratified analysis: Because of plausible triple interactive effects of body condition, age, and sex on liver PBDEs, analyses of age/body condition effects were conducted separately for males and females.
- Data handling: PBDE concentrations log-transformed; % lipid data arcsine-square-root transformed to meet GLM assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality.
- Below-detection data: Many congeners had values below LoD; for congeners with <80% below LoD, values below LoD interpolated per Hesel methods (1990, 2006). BDE209 not quantified; other congeners treated as per standard GLM input.
