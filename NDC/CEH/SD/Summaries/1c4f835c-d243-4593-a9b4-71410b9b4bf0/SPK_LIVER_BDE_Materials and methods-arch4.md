# Determination of PBDE concentrations in livers

## Overview
- This study analyzes archived livers from sparrowhawks collected across Britain (1998–2009) to determine PBDE concentrations and associated liver characteristics.
- Sample selection aimed to minimize temporal and spatial confounding, with stratification by sex, age, and body condition, resulting in 59 birds across eight groups.

## 1.1. Sample collection
- Voluntary collection from the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme and associated records (provenance, collection date, age, sex, body weight, body condition assessed visually).
- Necropsies performed to assign a putative cause of death.
- Tissues collected, weighed, and archived at -20°C; complete liver weight available for some birds, though not all due to damage or partial submissions.
- Archived livers from birds dying 1998–2009, within central England and within 250 km of the Welsh border, were chosen to limit variation.
- Birds categorized into eight groups by sex (male/female), age (adult/juvenile), and body condition (starved/non-starved).
- Group sizes ranged from 5 to 11 birds; total analyzed = 59.

## 1.2. Determination of PBDE concentrations in livers
- Approximately 1 g of liver tissue per bird was excised from various regions, homogenized, and weighed.
- Lipid content determined gravimetrically; PBDEs extracted and cleaned up.
- Analysis by GC-MS (Thermo-Finnigan Trace) with specified column and autosampler; calibrated with seven PBDE standards (2.5–250 pg/µL).
- Targeted a suite of 30 PBDE tri-Octa congeners (17, 28, 32, 35, 37, 47, 49, 51, 66, 71, 75, 77, 85, 99, 100, 118, 119, 126, 128, 138, 153, 154, 166, 183, 190, 196, 197, 201, 202, 203).
- BDE209 not quantified due to method limitations (poor recovery).
- Instrument detection limits (LoD) ranged from 2.5 pg/µL for certain congeners to 5 pg/µL for Octa BDEs, corresponding to liver LoDs of 0.27–0.54 ng/g wet weight.
- Eight procedural blanks used; sample concentrations blank-corrected.
- Recovery for 13 C12-labelled congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 ranged from 74.4% to 88.2%; concentrations adjusted for recovery.
- QC standard (five PBDEs across tri-hepta homologues) analyzed with unknowns; batches accepted if QC within ±10% of expected values.

## 1.3. Statistical analyses
- Analyses performed in Minitab 16.0.
- General Linear Models (GLM) used to test effects of age, sex, body condition, and breeding status on PBDE concentrations, total PBDEs, and liver characteristics (liver mass, liver % lipid).
- Due to potential complex interactions, analyses of age and body condition on liver BDEs conducted separately for males and females.
- PBDE concentrations log-transformed; liver % lipid arcsine square-root transformed to meet variance and normality assumptions.
- Values below LoD were treated with interpolation for congeners where <80% of values were below LoD, following Hesel methods; the document notes some values remained below LoD.

## Data handling and quality considerations
- Stratified sampling enhances representativeness and enables exploration of interactions among sex, age, and body condition.
- Rigorous QC and blank correction procedures underpin data reliability; recovery corrections applied using isotope-labeled standards.
- Missing liver weight data for some individuals acknowledged; selection criteria aimed to minimize confounding temporal/spatial factors.
- Transformation and handling of non-detects align with standard practices for environmental contaminant data, supporting valid GLM inferences.
