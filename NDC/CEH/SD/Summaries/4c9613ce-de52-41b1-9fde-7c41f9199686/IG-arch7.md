# IG Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio that may respond to environmental changes. Include predatory taxa alongside phytophagous invertebrates to detect ecosystem responses.

## Rationale
- Ground beetles are taxonomically tractable with substantial baseline information; pitfall trapping is a well-established method with ongoing standardisation. Carabids can indicate changes in management and climate; leg-colour morphs of P. madidus may reflect climate effects; M. morio may also respond to environmental change.

## Method
- Use pitfall trapping at ECN sites to sample Carabidae and M. morio; retain adult craneflies to cross-check larval identifications (Tipulidae handled in separate protocol); measure femur length of M. morio as a climate/altitude proxy; morphs of P. madidus recorded separately.

## Equipment
- Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep.
- Protection: chicken-wire cage to reduce small-mammal captures; trap covers (pot saucers with galvanised wire).
- Preservative: blue antifreeze (undiluted) stored in 25 L drums; aliquoted into traps to a depth of ~3 cm.
- Sorting: 1 mm mesh sieve for contents; white tray for examining specimens; labelled vials with 70% alcohol, 5% glycerol, 25% water.

## Location
- Three transects within different vegetation types, including the TSS; avoid cattle access.
- 10 pitfall traps per transect, 10 m spacing between traps.
- Traps should be approached from different directions to minimise trampling; if trampling persists, move traplines but record movements and report to Central Co-ordination Unit.

## Sampling
- Traps deployed on the first Wednesday in May and emptied/replaced every two weeks for 13 sampling periods (until end of October).

## Preservative and storage
- Undiluted antifreeze poured to ~3 cm depth; replacement traps prepared with marked lids for easy exchange.
- Collected catches stored at 4°C before sorting; if sorting cannot occur within three days, samples moved to 75% ethanol.

## Sorting and processing
- Sort catches under good light; extract taxa of interest into individual labelled vials.
- Label each specimen with ECN site, trap number, and collection date; store in a storage bottle.
- Bulk catches from ten traps stored together after identification.

## Data recording conventions (data schema)
- Core measurement: ground predators (IG Protocol); data collected fortnightly across 13 periods.
- Transects: each of ten traps treated as a single sampling location.
- Key fields (per dataset entry): Trap ID, Species code, Species name, Number caught, Unit/precision codes, BRC codes; for harvestmen also femur length.
- Data keys for GIS linking: Site Identification Code (e.g., T05), Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC), Location Code (e.g., 01), Sampling Date (with time as needed).
- For harvestmen, include femur length measurements with 0.1 unit precision.

## Recording forms
- Three forms available via CCU:
  1) Species recording form (one per transect),
  2) Pitfall trap dates and quality information form,
  3) Femur length recording form for harvestmen.
- Appendix II provides examples; forms are aligned with ECNCCU data transfer standards.

## Notes on coding and standards
- Trap IDs must be unique within each ECN site (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, T21–T30 for transect 03).
- For P. madidus, record leg-colour morphs and gender using codes after the species name:
  - FR = female red legs, MR = male red legs, FB = female black legs, MB = male black legs.
- Coding follows Biological Records Centre standards (ITE Monks Wood, UK).
