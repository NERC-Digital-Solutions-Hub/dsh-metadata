# IG Protocol

- Aim
  - Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio that may respond to environmental changes.
  - Include predatory invertebrates alongside phytophagous species (e.g., moths, butterflies, spittle bugs) to detect ecosystem responses to environmental change.
  - Leverage taxonomic tractability and existing knowledge of Carabidae; monitor leg-color morphs of Pterostichus madidus; collect Mitopus morio in pitfall traps; use craneflies to cross-check identifications with larvae from soil cores.

- Rationale
  - Ground beetles are sensitive indicators of management and environmental change.
  - Pitfall trapping is a well-developed, standard method; active standardisation efforts are underway.
  - Morphological variation (e.g., leg color in P. madidus) may relate to climate; capture and record morphs separately.
  - Harvestmen (Mitopus morio) included as additional potential responders.

- Method
  - At each site, establish a pitfall trapping system adjacent to the transect sampling site (TSS) to sample Carabidae and Mitopus morio; retain adult craneflies to verify identifications against larvae from soil cores.
  - Measure femur length of M. morio as a potential climate/altitude response.
  - All carabids (not just Carabus spp.) are of interest.
  - Protocol follows the established approach developed by Dr M.L. Luff, with standardisation and quality considerations.

- Equipment
  - Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep; protective chicken-wire cage to reduce small mammal catches; trap covers from plant pot saucers and galvanised wire.
  - Optional: antifreeze preservative for sample storage (used undiluted at ~3 cm depth); pre-filled replacement traps with marked lids; storage and sorting containers.
  - Sorting: 1 mm mesh sieve; 10 cm diameter dish; labelled vials with 70% alcohol, 5% glycerol, 25% water.

- Location and sampling design
  - Three transects within different vegetation types, including the TSS; avoid cattle access.
  - Ten pitfall traps per transect, spaced 10 m apart.
  - If possible, approach transects from different directions to reduce trampling bias; if trampling is deleterious long-term, move traplines but document movements and report to Central Co-ordination Unit.
  - Sampling schedule: traps set on the first Wednesday in May; emptied and replaced fortnightly for 13 sampling periods (through late October).

- Time and sampling workflow
  - Fieldwork and collection timing coordinated with replacements; catches preserved and transported to storage for sorting within specified timeframes.
  - Sorting and identification conducted under proper conditions; ensure specimen integrity, particularly for M. morio leg measurements.

- Recording and data conventions
  - Core dataset parameters for each ECN sampling location (a transect of ten traps is treated as a single sampling location):
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date/Time (including time when applicable)
  - Core measurement: Invertebrates - ground predators
  - For each transect of ten traps: record per trap
    - Trap ID, Species code, Species name, Number caught
    - Gender and specimen-level data (where applicable)
    - For harvestmen: include femur length measurements
  - Special notes for Pterostichus madidus:
    - Record separate leg-color morph codes after the species name (FR female red legs, MR male red legs, FB female black legs, MB male black legs)
  - Data formatting and storage: follow the ECN dataset specifications; use the designated forms and recording conventions; each sampling location is defined by core measurement and trap information.

- Recording forms
  - Species recording form: one per of the three transects (example provided in Appendix II)
  - Pitfall trap dates and quality information form
  - Form for recording femur lengths for harvestmen

- Notes and coding
  - Trap IDs should be unique within an ECN site (e.g., T1–T10 for Transect 01, T11–T20 for Transect 02, etc.)
  - Follow the Biological Records Centre coding conventions for species, morphs, and gender
  - Use the standard data coding system currently used by the Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood, Abbots Ripton, Huntingdon, Cambs

- Appendix I and data management
  - Equipment sources and specifications (pitfall traps, test sieves)
  - Data transfer and dataset formats are defined in ECNCCU documentation; data submitters should consult the Data Transfer documentation and contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access

  - Ground beetles as indicators of grassland management (Supporting literature cited for context)
  - Morphology and climate-related variation in Pterostichus madidus
  - Protocols and standardisation references informing the sampling design and processing

- Summary of purpose for monitoring framework authors
  - This protocol provides a defined, standardised approach to monitor predatory invertebrates as environmental health indicators.
  - It emphasizes data quality, traceable metadata, clear recording conventions, and governance through central coordination and data transfer documentation.
