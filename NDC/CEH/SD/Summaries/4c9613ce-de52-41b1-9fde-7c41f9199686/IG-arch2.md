# IG Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio to detect potential responses to environmental changes.
- Include predatory invertebrates alongside phytophagous insects (moths, butterflies, spittle bugs) as they may amplify or indicate environmental change.
- Build on established pitfall-trapping methods and standardise procedures to enable reliable comparisons over time.

## Rationale
- Ground beetles are taxonomically tractable with a substantial information base; they have shown sensitivity to management and climate factors.
- Pterostichus madidus leg-colour morphs may respond to climate change; morphs will be recorded separately.
- Mitopus morio characteristics may reflect environmental changes and will be collected for measurement.
- The protocol follows a method developed by M.L. Luff and aligns with ongoing standardisation efforts to improve data comparability.

## Method

### Equipment
- Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter × 10 cm deep.
- Protective cage: chicken wire (≈15 mm × 20 mm mesh, ≈70 mm high) clipped to each trap.
- Covers: cheap from 5" plant pot saucers and galvanised wire to prevent flooding and interference.
- Optional: 1 mm mesh sieve for sorting, 4°C storage for samples.

### Location
- Three transects within different vegetation types, including the sampling site (TSS); avoid cattle access.
- Ten traps per transect (total of 30 traps per site) with 10 m spacing.
- If trampling impacts vegetation, move a trapline yearly but return to the original position every three years; record any movements and report to Central Co-ordination Unit.

### Sampling
- Set traps on the first Wednesday in May; empty and replace every two weeks for 13 sampling periods (through October).
- Preservative: antifreeze (undiluted) poured to ~3 cm depth in each trap; if rain dilutes, the heavier undiluted antifreeze remains at the bottom.
- Replacement traps pre-filled; when replacing, remove old trap, place new trap, ensure seating, and cover removed to container with catch.
- Catch storage: store at 4°C before sorting; if sorting cannot occur within 3 days, transfer to 75% ethanol.

### Sorting and Identification
- Sort by pouring contents through a 1 mm mesh sieve, collect preservative, then wash into a crystallising dish for examination.
- Taxa of interest moved to labelled vials with a 70% alcohol, 5% glycerol, 25% water mixture.
- Label each catch with site ID, trap number, and collection date; store catches separately by trap until post-identification bulk storage.
- For harvestmen (Mitopus morio), take care to preserve legs for length measurements.

### Time
- Fortnightly sampling from May to end of October (13 periods) per transect.

## Specification of results and recording conventions

### Core parameters (must be included for each dataset)
- Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
- Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
- Location Code (e.g., 01)
- Sampling Date/time

### Data collection for ground predators (IG Protocol)
- For each transect (ten traps), record:
  - Trap ID
  - Species code and species name
  - Number caught (and units)
  - Genus/species (and associated BRC code)
  - For individual records: gender (M/F) where applicable, femur length for harvestmen (in mm with 0.1 mm precision)
  - For harvestmen: femur length measurements

### Forms and data entry
- Three forms available from the Central Coordination Unit (CCU):
  - Species recording form (one per transect)
  - Pitfall trap dates and quality information form
  - Harvestmen femur length recording form
- Codes and morph codes:
  - Morphs for Pterostichus madidus (FR, MR, FB, MB) indicating female/male and red/black legs
- Unique trap IDs should be organized by transect (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, etc.)
- Coding conventions follow Biological Records Centre standards (ITE Monks Wood)

### Data standards and transfer
- Data submitted to ECN Central Coordination Unit (ECNCCU) with defined dataset formats (refer to Data Transfer documentation on the restricted extranet).
- Primary data management considerations include ensuring trap-level records are kept separate until after identification, then bulked for storage.
- Contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access and guidance on data handling.

## Notes
- The protocol references standard sources and prior work (e.g., Eyre et al. 1989; Terrell-Nield 1992; Thiele 1977; Luff’s method) and aligns with ongoing standardisation efforts.
