# IG Protocol

## Overview
- Aims to monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio that may respond to environmental changes.
- Also includes phytophagous invertebrates (moths, butterflies, spittle bugs) to broaden detection of environmental change.
- Ground beetles chosen for taxonomic tractability and existing data; pitfall trapping is the primary sampling method.
- Morphs of Pterostichus madidus (leg color) will be recorded separately; Mitopus morio harvestmen collected as well.
- Protocol builds on, and aligns with, established methods (notably M.L. Luff's protocol); aims for standardization and comparability over time and sites.

## Rationale and Scientific Background (Data and System Implications)
- Ground predators can act as indicators of management and environmental change; carabids sensitive to temperature and climate change may reveal shifts via morphs or abundance.
- Data collection supports long-term ecological monitoring and enables analyses of environmental responses.

## Protocol Summary (Sampling Design)
- Location: three transects near TSS (two or more vegetation types), not in cattle-access areas.
- Sampling units: 10 pitfall traps per transect, with 10 m spacing between traps.
- Transects ideally approached from different directions to reduce trampling bias; if trampling is problematic, traplines can be moved but must be recorded and reported to the Central Co-ordination Unit.
- Timing: sampling spans May to end of October; traps are deployed first Wednesday in May and emptied/replaced every two weeks for 13 periods.
- Target taxa: Carabidae (all species) and Mitopus morio; adult craneflies collected for cross-check with larvae (separate protocol for Tipulidae).

## Equipment and Setup
- Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep.
- Protective cage: chicken wire to reduce capture of small mammals.
- Covers: plant pot saucers and galvanized wire to shield from rain and birds; facilitates relocation.
- Preservation: antifreeze (blue antifreeze) added to traps at ~3 cm depth; undiluted preservative preferred; replacement traps pre-filled with marked lids.
- Storage: samples stored at 4°C before sorting; if sorting delayed beyond 3 days, samples stored in 75% alcohol.

## Sampling Procedures and Sorting (Field to Lab)
- Replacement procedure: remove old trap, insert new trap, reseat, and replace lid; keep lids with catches.
- Sorting: sieve contents through 1 mm mesh; collect preservative for reuse; rinse traps; transfer contents to a crystallising dish for examination under good light.
- Specimen handling: identify and sort taxa into labeled vials with a 70% alcohol/5% glycerol/25% water mix; special care for Mitopus morio legs for measurements.
- Labeling: label each catch with ECN site ID, trap number, and collection date; store in storage bottle.
- Recording and storage: keep trap records separate until after identification, then bulk samples from ten traps for storage.

## Data Standards, Recording, and Metadata (Core Variables)
- Core dataset for each ECN sampling location (13 periods per transect) includes:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time (with time element as needed)
- Core measurement: invertebrates – ground predators.
- Recording forms: three types (species recording per transect, trap dates/quality info, femur lengths for harvestmen).
- Taxa and morph codes (examples):
  - Pterostichus madidus leg color morphs: FR (female red legs), MR (male red legs), FB (female black legs), MB (male black legs)
- Data capture fields per trap: trap ID, species code, species name, count, gender (where applicable), morphs, femur length for harvestmen.
- Unique trap IDs: within each ECN site (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, etc.).
- Data formats and transfer: follows ECN dataset specifications; Core Measurement Code and Location Code provide site- and measurement-level context; data transfer documentation and restricted-access Site Managers’ extranet available via ECNCCU.

## Data Management, Coordination, and Documentation
- Central Coordination Unit (CCU) oversees data collection compliance and reporting of trap-line movements.
- Data transfer documentation accompanies field data; ECNCCU contact provided for access.
- Notes and guidance for data coding align with Biological Records Centre conventions (ITE Monks Wood) for consistency.
