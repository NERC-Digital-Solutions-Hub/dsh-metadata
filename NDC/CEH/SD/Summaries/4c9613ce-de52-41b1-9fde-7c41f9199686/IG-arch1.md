# IG Protocol

- Aim
  - Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record the presence and features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio, to detect responses to environmental changes. Also to sample phytophagous invertebrates (moths, butterflies, spittle bugs) as part of broad ecosystem monitoring. P. madidus leg-color morphs may indicate climate effects; M. morio femur length may vary with altitude/latitude and environmental change.

- Rationale
  - Ground beetles are taxonomically tractable and have a substantial information base; pitfall trapping is a well-established, cross-site method, with ongoing standardisation efforts. Carabids can serve as indicators of management and climate effects; some morphs and morphometrics may reflect environmental variation.

- Method
  - Ground predators sampling design
    - Location: three transects within different vegetation types, near the TSS; avoid cattle access. Ten pitfall traps per transect, spaced 10 m apart.
    - Temporal: traps set on the first Wednesday in May and emptied/replaced fortnightly for 13 periods (May–October).
    - Movement: transects should be approached from different directions to reduce trampling; if vegetation damage becomes an issue, a trapline can be moved but should be logged and returned to original position every three years.
  - Equipment
    - Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter × 10 cm deep.
    - Protection: chicken wire cage to exclude small mammals; trap covers (plant pot saucers and galvanized wire).
    - Preservation/handling: antifreeze preservative (blue antifreeze) for sampling; traps filled to ~3 cm depth; store catches at 4°C; if sorting cannot occur within 3 days, preserve in 75% alcohol.
    - Sorting: use a 1 mm mesh sieve; sort into labelled vials with 70% ethanol, 5% glycerol, 25% water; avoid damaging Mitopus morio legs.
  - Sampling and processing
    - At each sampling event, record catches by trap; preserve and label specimens with site ID, trap number, and collection date.
    - For harvestmen (Mitopus morio), measure femur length (variable with environmental factors); ensure leg measurements are taken from specimens kept for morphometrics.
    - Sorting and identification conducted under appropriate conditions; retain adult craneflies for cross-checks with larvae from soil cores (separate protocol for Tipulidae).
  - Data handling and storage
    - Keep trap records separate by trap until identification is complete; then bulk the ten-trap data for storage.
    - Store specimens in appropriate long-term storage; preserve chain of custody and sample integrity.

- Data and recording conventions
  - Core dataset identifiers (required for all ECN data submissions)
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date/time
  - Core measurement: invertebrates - ground predators (IG Protocol)
  - Data fields per transect (ten traps)
    - Trap ID, Species code, Species name, Number caught
    - For individuals: gender (where recorded), species code, and any morph or sex-specific codes as applicable
  - Harvestmen data
    - Species, number, gender, and femur length (to 0.1 mm precision)
  - Morphology codes (Pterostichus madidus)
    - FR female red legs
    - MR male red legs
    - FB female black legs
    - MB male black legs
  - Data collection forms (three types)
    - Species recording form (one per transect)
    - Pitfall trap dates and quality information form
    - Femur length recording form for harvestmen
  - Recording conventions and data standards
    - Use standardized coding from the Biological Records Centre (ITE Monks Wood)
    - Unique trap IDs within each ECN site (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, etc.)
    - Follow site-specific data transfer documentation for ECN datasets
  - Notes
    - Separate rows for morphs and gender when recording P. madidus
    - Ensure consistency with existing BRC coding and ECNCCU data formats

  - Appendix II: Example recording forms and data templates for species, trap dates, and femur lengths
  - References to foundational work on ground beetles as indicators (e.g., Eyre et al. 1989; Thiele 1977; Terrell-Nield 1992) and the ongoing standardisation of pitfall data collection

- End goals for analysts
  - Produce comparable, high-quality datasets across ECN sites to identify changes in predator communities in response to environmental changes.
  - Enable cross-site analyses of abundance, species composition, morph frequencies, and body-morphometrics (e.g., femur length) as potential climate or management indicators.
  - Ensure data traceability and reusability by adhering to documented data formats, metadata, and specimen-tracking procedures.
