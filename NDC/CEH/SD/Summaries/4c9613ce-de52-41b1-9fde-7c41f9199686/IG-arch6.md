# IG Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio as potential responders to environmental change.
- Include phytophagous invertebrates (e.g., moths, butterflies, spittle bugs) in the broader context of ecological response.
- Use a standardised, taxonomically tractable protocol to enable meaningful comparisons over time and space.

## Rationale
- Ground beetles are suitable indicators due to taxonomic clarity and existing data; pitfall trapping is well established.
- Standardisation efforts mitigate data interpretation issues; carabids have shown sensitivity to management and climate factors.
- Pterostichus madidus leg-colour morphs may reflect climate effects; morphs will be recorded separately.
- Mitopus morio (harvestman) may also respond to environmental change and is collected for measurement.

## Method

### Equipment
- Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep.
- Cage: chicken wire to reduce non-target captures.
- Cover: plant pot saucers and galvanised wire.
- Preservative: antifreeze (Blue antifreeze) stored, decanted into small bottles as needed.
- Spare traps: pre-filled with marked lids for replacement.
- Storage: traps and catches stored at 4°C; if sorting is delayed beyond 3 days, preserve in 75% alcohol.
- Sorting: sieve catches through 1 mm mesh; sort under good light into labelled vials with 70% alcohol, 5% glycerol, 25% water.
- Labeling: ECN site ID, trap number, and collection date on labels; store catches per trap until pooling after identification.

### Location
- Three transects within different vegetation types, including the TSS, avoiding cattle access.
- 10 traps per transect, 10 m spacing between traps.
- Approach transects from different directions when possible to minimise trampling; if trampling harms vegetation, move traplines but revert to original positions every three years and record movements.

### Sampling
- Start: first Wednesday in May.
- Frequency: fortnightly collections for 13 sampling periods (through end of October).
- All steps from collection to storage follow the sequence: replace traps, preserve catches, store at 4°C, then sort and identify.

## Data Recording and Formats

### Core measurements and dataset structure
- Core measurement: invertebrates - ground predators (IG Protocol).
- For each transect (ten traps) treated as a single sampling location, record fortnightly:
  - Trap ID
  - Species code
  - Species name
  - Number caught
  - Units/precision codes
  - Genus/species code (where applicable)
  - Additional data (e.g., gender, if recorded)
- Harvestmen (Mitopus morio) include femur length measurements (mm) with specified precision.
- Each ECN sampling location must include four core identifiers:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g. T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g. PC)
  - Location Code (e.g. 01)
  - Sampling Date (and time if needed)

### Recording forms
- Three CCU forms are available:
  1) Species recording form (one per transect; includes notes on leg colour morphs and gender for Pterostichus madidus)
  2) Pitfall trap dates and quality information form
  3) Form for recording femur lengths for harvestmen

### Coding and data standards
- Trap IDs must be unique within each ECN site (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, T21–T30 for transect 03).
- Morph coding for Pterostichus madidus follows BRC conventions:
  - FR = female red legs
  - MR = male red legs
  - FB = female black legs
  - MB = male black legs
- Use the standard Biological Records Centre coding where applicable.
- Data transfer formats and detailed dataset specifications are provided in the ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation (restricted extranet). Contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

## Notes
- Ensure consistent trap numbering and traceability from capture to identification.
- Maintain careful records of any changes to trap locations and rationale.
- Preserve specimen integrity for morphological measurements (especially leg morphs and femur lengths).
