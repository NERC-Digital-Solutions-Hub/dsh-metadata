# IG Protocol

- Aim
  - Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio, with optional inclusion of phytophagous invertebrates (moths, butterflies, spittle bugs) to detect environmental change.
  - Use morphometric data (e.g., femur length of M. morio) and morph colour variants to identify potential climate- or habitat-related responses.

- Rationale
  - Ground beetles are taxonomically tractable and have established protocols; they can serve as sensitive indicators of management and climate effects.
  - Pterostichus madidus leg-colour morphs may reflect environmental changes; M. morio harvestmen are included as additional potential indicators.
  - The protocol aligns with the standard method developed by Dr M.L. Luff; acknowledges known issues with trap data interpretation and ongoing standardisation.

- Method overview
  - At each site, establish pitfall trapping for Carabidae and M. morio near the TSS; retain adult craneflies for cross-checks with larvae.
  - Measure second femur length of M. morio to capture altitude/latitude effects and potential environmental responses.
  - Include all carabid beetles (not limited to Carabus spp.) in analyses.

- Equipment and setup
  - Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep; chicken-wire cage to reduce non-target captures; trap covers to prevent flooding and disturbance.
  - Location: three transects across different vegetation types, avoiding cattle access; 10 traps per transect, 10 m spacing; record any transect movement.
  - Preservative: antifreeze (undiluted) in traps; storage at 4°C prior to sorting.

- Location and sampling design
  - transects within diverse vegetation types including the TSS; record movements if necessary to minimize trampling damage.
  - Sampling window: first Wednesday in May, then fortnightly for 13 periods (May–October).

- Sampling schedule and sample handling
  - Replace traps with pre-filled, marked lids; maintain seating; store catches at 4°C before sorting.
  - If sorting not possible within three days, preserve catches in 75% alcohol to prevent deterioration.
  - Sorting workflow: sieve contents through a 1 mm mesh; recover preservative for reuse; transfer taxa to labelled vials with 70% alcohol, 5% glycerol, 25% water; maintain careful handling to avoid damaging M. morio legs.

- Sorting, identification, and specimen labeling
  - Identify and label catches by ECN site, trap number, and collection date; separate by trap before bulk storage (for later combination across traps).
  - Prioritize preserving leg features for M. morio morphometrics; record species where identification is certain.

- Data recording, coding, and core variables
  - Core dataset structure (Core measurement: invertebrates - ground predators):
    - Four key identifiers for each sampling occasion: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date.
    - For each transect (ten traps): trap ID, species code, species name, number caught, units, and relevant notes.
    - For individual records (where applicable): species code, individual gender, measurement details (e.g., femur length for harvestmen), precision codes.
  - Specifics for M. morio and morphs:
    - Record femur length (mm) with 0.1 mm precision.
    - Record leg-colour morphs for P. madidus using codes: FR (female red legs), MR (male red legs), FB (female black legs), MB (male black legs).
  - Harvestmen data and pore measurements: include separate fields for femur length as above.

- Data transfer, storage, and access
  - Data submission to ECNCCU follows defined Data Transfer documentation and ECN dataset formats (restricted access Site Managers' extranet).
  - Each ECN Site assigns its own codes for replicates across core measurements; separate records per sampling occasion; forms provided for species recording, trap dates/quality, and femur lengths.

- Data quality, governance, and documentation
  - Maintain traceability: unique Trap IDs within a site, standardized species codes, and consistent data recording practices.
  - Use designated forms for data capture (three types: species recording, trap dates/quality, femur-length recording) to ensure consistency.
  - Documentation and appendices provide equipment details, supplier information, and specimen handling procedures to support reproducibility and interoperability.

- Appendices and references (contextual)
  - Appendix I lists pitfall trap equipment details and testing sieves.
  - Notes specify data coding conventions and alignment with Biological Records Centre standards.
  - Data formats align with ECNCCU data transfer and dataset specification for the ground predator core measurement.
