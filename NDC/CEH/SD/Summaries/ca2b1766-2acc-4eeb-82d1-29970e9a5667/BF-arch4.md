# BF Protocol

- Aim: To record the phenology of spawning of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in selected ponds and ditches by counting egg masses as an indicator of population health, identify significant changes, and measure pond characteristics that may influence breeding success.

- Rationale: Frogs are indicators of habitat quality; spawning occurs in shallow water and is influenced by land conditions and water chemistry. Acidification and metal exposure are relevant stressors; spawning counts (egg masses) provide a rough, practical estimate of colony size and breeding success.

- Methods (overview):
  - Location and equipment: select one or more shallow ponds/ditches with recent breeding; use field pH meter, max/min thermometer, depth pole; attach colored thread to new spawn masses to avoid double counting.
  - Sampling schedule:
    - Start weekly checks from around the first spawning (date varies by location); aim for daily visits during spawning until eggs hatch; if daily visits aren’t possible, maintain at least weekly checks.
    - After hatching begins, continue weekly monitoring until metamorphosed frogs leave the pond or 16 weeks have passed since spawning (whichever is shorter).
  - Spawn data collection:
    - Record the date first spawn is seen; count new spawn masses since last visit; mark each new mass with thread.
    - Estimate total surface area of water occupied by spawn; estimate percentage of dead/diseased eggs.
    - If visits are infrequent and spawn masses exceed 100, rely on surface area measurement rather than counting all new masses.
    - Record the date when embryos first hatch; after hatch begins, continue daily/weekly monitoring as described.
  - Physico-chemical measurements:
    - At first spawning, collect a 250 mL water sample for baseline chemical analysis; measure pH and conductivity on unfiltered water.
    - After filtering, analyze for dissolved ions and compounds: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.
    - If unexplained high mortality occurs, take an additional sample for the same analyses.
  - Ongoing pond environment measurements (weekly): measure pH at three random positions near the edge at 50 mm depth; use a field pH meter; deploy a float-mounted max/min thermometer at 50 mm depth to record water temperature; measure water depth at the centre of the spawning area.

- Data management and specifications:
  - Data identifiers (required for all datasets): 
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date/time
  - Core measurement: vertebrates – frog spawn (BF Protocol)
    - Daily spawn monitoring during the spawning period
    - Weekly pond environment data (pH, temperature, depth)
    - Annual water chemistry determinands from the first pond sample
    - Detailed recording of key dates: first congregating, first spawning, first hatching, first metamorphs leaving
    - Variables with units and precision guidance (e.g., pH and temperature to 0.1; chemical determinands to 3 significant figures)
  - Data formats: follow ECN dataset specifications and Data Transfer documentation; data submitted to ECNCCU via restricted extranet with documented metadata.
  - Recording forms: standard field recording form available from the CCU; example provided in Appendix II.

- Practical notes:
  - Spawning dates vary by location (earlier in Cornwall, later at higher elevations); schedule should be adjusted accordingly.
  - If daily visits are not feasible, ensure as frequent visits as possible with a minimum weekly cadence during spawning and until hatch completion.

- Recording and references:
  - Recording conventions emphasize unique identifiers and consistent timing for samples and observations.
  - References and methodological context are provided to support interpretation of pond chemistry and embryo development effects.
