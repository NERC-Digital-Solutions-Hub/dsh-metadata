# BF Protocol

## Aim
- Record the phenology of spawning of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in selected ponds and ditches.
- Use the number of egg masses as an indicator of frog population health and to identify significant changes.
- Measure pond characteristics that may affect breeding success.

## Rationale
- Common frog is an ecologically important predator; breeding sites and terrestrial conditions influence populations.
- Spawn counts provide a rough estimate of colony size; monitoring focuses on accessibility of shallow water where spawning occurs.

## Method

- Overview
  - Monitor one or more shallow ponds/ditches with recent breeding activity and convenient access.
  - Daily monitoring begins at the start of spawning; weekly checks otherwise.
  - Record first appearance of spawn and subsequent changes.

- Field schedule
  - Check ponds weekly from around 1 January (adjust by local knowledge).
  - If possible, visit daily from first spawning until eggs hatch; otherwise, minimum weekly visits.

- Spawn counting and tracking
  - Count new spawn masses each visit; attach a coloured thread to each new mass to avoid double counting.
  - Estimate total surface area of water occupied by spawn if counting becomes impractical (e.g., >100 masses).
  - Record date of first spawn, dates of egg mass appearance, and date of first hatching.
  - After hatching begins, continue weekly monitoring until metamorphosed frogs leave the pond or for up to 16 weeks from first spawn (whichever is shorter).

- Mass verification and health
  - Distinguish newly deposited masses by densely packed eggs and unexpanded jelly capsules.
  - Record percentage of dead or diseased eggs.

- Metamorphs
  - Record date when newly metamorphosed frogs are first seen leaving the pond.

## Equipment
- Field-appropriate pH meter
- Maximum/minimum thermometer
- Water depth measurement pole (or a simple hand-made equivalent)

## Location
- Selected shallow ponds or wet ditches with known recent breeding, chosen for ease of frequent visits.

## Biological data collection (phenology)

- Key dates to record
  - Date frogs first congregate and begin calling
  - Date of first spawning
  - Date of first hatching
  - Date newly metamorphosed frogs first seen leaving
- Recording cadence
  - Daily records for spawn development during spawning period
  - Weekly records for pH and temperature from first spawning to metamorphs leaving
- Spawn data
  - Number of new spawn masses per visit
  - Total surface area of pond covered by spawn
  - Percentage of eggs dead or diseased
  - Identification of pond (pond ID) and sampling location details

## Physiochemical data collection

- Water sampling
  - Collect a one-time 250 mL water sample at first spawning for baseline chemical characterization
  - Analyze unfiltered water for conductivity and pH; filter for ions and dissolved constituents
  - Determinands: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon
  - If unexplained mortality occurs, take an additional sample for the same determinations
- In situ measurements during spawning window
  - Weekly pH and temperature at three random positions near the edge of the spawning area at 50 mm depth
  - Use a 50 mm depth for temperature measurements with a suitable float setup
  - Record pond water depth at the center of the spawning area

## Data specification and recording conventions

- Core data identifiers (must be included in all datasets)
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time (with time for frequent sampling)
- Core measurement: vertebrates - frog spawn (BF Protocol)
  - Annual, pond-wide monitoring with daily spawn records and weekly pond environment measurements
  - One pond water sample per site/year for chemical determinands
  - Schedule includes: dates of first congregating, first spawning, first hatching, and first metamorphs leaving
  - Data fields cover pond identifiers, sampling times, pH, conductance, alkalinity, and ion concentrations
  - Spawn-specific data include number of new spawn masses, total area covered, dead/diseased eggs, and dates related to spawn development
- Data quality and transfer
  - Recording forms and data transfer specifications are available from the ECN CCU
  - Data formats and site/location codes are documented in the ECN Data Transfer documentation (restricted extranet)
