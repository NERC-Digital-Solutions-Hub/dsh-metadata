# BF Protocol

- Aim
  - Record the phenology of spawning of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in selected ponds and ditches.
  - Use the number of egg masses as an indicator of frog population health and identify significant changes.
  - Measure pond characteristics that may affect breeding success.

- Rationale
  - The common frog is a widespread predator with breeding linked to shallow water bodies and terrestrial habitats.
  - Historical declines linked to drainage, habitat modification, pollution, and acidification effects on embryos and larvae.
  - Egg mass counts provide a rough proxy for colony size; spawning occurs in accessible, shallow water.

- Method (overview)
  - Field monitoring of designated pond/ditch sites with standardized data collection.
  - Weekly and daily observations around spawning; periodic water chemistry and physical measurements.
  - Documentation and recording conventions to support cross-site data comparability and long-term analyses.

- Equipment
  - Field pH meter and maximum/minimum thermometer.
  - Simple water depth pole and basic recording tools.
  - Materials for marking spawn masses (e.g., colored thread and bodkin).

- Location
  - One or more shallow ponds or wet ditches with recent breeding activity and feasible access for regular visits.

- Biological monitoring (spawning and counts)
  - Start monitoring when males congregate and begin calling; check ponds weekly from around January 1 (or local equivalent) and daily until first eggs hatch; if daily visits aren’t possible, aim for as frequent as feasible with a minimum weekly cadence.
  - Record the date of first spawn and count new spawn masses on subsequent visits; mark each new mass with a colored thread to avoid double-counting.
  - Estimates and observations:
    - Total surface area of water occupied by spawn masses.
    - Percentage of dead or diseased eggs.
    - After hatch, continue weekly monitoring until metamorphosed frogs are observed leaving the pond or for up to 16 weeks post-spawn.
  - Notes on spawn detection and timing are used to infer breeding success.

- Physico-chemical monitoring
  - At first spawning, collect a 250 ml pond water sample for baseline chemical analysis.
  - In unfiltered water: measure conductivity and pH; after filtration, analyze dissolved ions (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P), alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.
  - If unexplained mortality occurs, collect an additional water sample for the same chemical analyses.
  - Ongoing measurements during the spawning period:
    - pH, temperature, and water depth measured weekly at three positions near the edge of the spawning area (depth ~50 mm).
    - A field pH meter and a float-attached thermometer at 50 mm depth; record initial spawning conditions and re-check weekly.

- Specification of results and recording conventions (data capture)
  - Data are organized to support standardized datasets across ECN sites.
  - First four core identifiers for every data record:
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date/time (with time if sampling is more frequent than daily)
  - Core measurement: vertebrates – frog spawn (BF Protocol)
  - Key recorded events and dates for each pond:
    - Pond ID and dates: first seen congregating, first spawning, first hatching, first newly metamorphosed frogs leaving.
  - pond sample and measurements:
    - pH, Conductivity, Alkalinity, and ion concentrations (e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, PO4 3--P).
    - Depth at center of spawning area, minimum/maximum temperature, and pH at multiple positions.
  - Recording formats and precision:
    - Data are captured with specified coding (Site ID, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date).
    - Recording precision is defined for each parameter (e.g., temperature to 0.1°C, pH to 0.1 units, ion concentrations to appropriate significant figures).
  - Recording forms
    - A standard field recording form is provided (Appendix II) for consistency.

- Data management and accessibility (implied)
  - Data transfer documentation exists for ECN dataset formats and is available via restricted access Site Managers’ extranet.
  - Clear metadata and standardized codes facilitate cross-site comparisons and future analyses.
