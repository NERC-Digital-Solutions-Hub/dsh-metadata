# BF Protocol

## Aim
- Record the phenology of the spawning of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in selected ponds and ditches.
- Use the number of egg masses as an indicator of frog population health and monitor for significant changes.
- Measure pond characteristics that may influence breeding success to support broader ecological understanding.

## Rationale
- The common frog is a widespread predatory amphibian, with breeding in shallow water and larval development affected by land conditions.
- Historic declines linked to agricultural drainage, habitat modification, pollution, and acidification.
- Spawning and embryo development are influenced by pH, aluminum, temperature, and other factors; monitoring aims to capture sublethal and mortality risks in field conditions.

## Method

### FROG SPAWN
- Monitor selected ponds/ditches to assess spawn mass counts, surface area of spawn, and egg/mass health as a proxy for population status.
- Record physical pond characteristics that may affect breeding success.

### Equipment
- Field-ready pH meter and maximum/minimum thermometer (others as needed, e.g., water depth pole).

### Location
- One or more shallow ponds or ditches known for recent frog breeding, chosen for practical access for frequent visits.

### Biological
- Spawn timing varies by region; recording starts when male frogs congregate and calling begins.
- Visits: weekly from 1 January (adjustable by local knowledge), daily until eggs hatch if feasible; minimum weekly visits if daily are not possible.
- Data: date of first spawn, daily/weekly new spawn masses (with a colored thread attached to edges to avoid double counting), total surface area of water occupied by spawn, and percentage of dead or diseased eggs.
- After spawning, monitor until metamorphosed frogs leave the pond or up to 16 weeks from first spawn, whichever comes first.

### Physico-chemical
- At first spawning, collect a 250 ml pond water sample for baseline chemical analysis (conductivity, pH, and a suite of dissolved ions and compounds after filtration).
- If unexplained mortality occurs, collect a second sample for the same analyses.
- Weekly measurements of pH (at three positions near the spawning area, depth ~50 mm) and water temperature (via a float thermometer at ~50 mm depth).
- Depth at the spawning center is recorded weekly.

### Recording conventions and data specification
- Data are captured in formats defined for ECN Site data (ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation; restricted extranet access).
- Four core identifiers are required for every dataset entry:
  - Site Identification Code (unique ECN Site code)
  - Core Measurement Code (unique code for each core measurement)
  - Location Code (site-specific location for replicates)
  - Sampling Date/Time (date and time of data recording)
- Core measurement: vertebrates - frog spawn (BF Protocol)
  - Variables include pond ID, date first seen congregating, date of first spawning, date of first hatching, date newly metamorphosed frogs first seen leaving, and pond sample details.
  - Weekly pond monitoring includes pH and temperature; daily spawn monitoring tracks spawn counts and surface area; water chemistry results include: Alkalinity, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P, and dissolved organic carbon, with specified units and precisions.
  - Data recording fields require precision specifications (e.g., significant figures, measurement units) as defined in the ECNCCU dataset documentation.
- Recording forms
  - A standard field recording form is available from the ECNCCU; Appendix II provides an example.

## Data Standards and Governance (Implications for Data Stewards)
- Collaboration with ECN data transfer and site management teams to ensure consistent dataset formats and metadata.
- Use of unique identifiers (Site ID, Core Measurement Code, Location Code) and precise sampling timestamps to ensure traceability across sites and time.
- Documentation of methods, timings, and measurement conventions to support reproducibility and data reuse.
- Ensuring timely data upload to ECN portals and adherence to data specification documents; access to transfer documentation and support contacts is needed (e.g., ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk).
- Quality controls embedded in procedures (e.g., thread-marking of spawn masses to avoid double counting, standardized sampling depths, and repeated measurements) to improve data reliability.
- Availability of standard recording forms to promote uniform data capture and easier downstream data management.

## Endnotes
- The protocol situates frog spawn data within a broader ECN framework, linking field observations to environmental chemistry and pond ecosystem health, with explicit data structure and transfer guidelines to support consistent, auditable datasets.
