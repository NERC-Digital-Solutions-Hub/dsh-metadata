# BF Protocol

- Aim
  - Record the phenology of spawning of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in selected ponds and ditches by counting egg masses as an indicator of frog population health.
  - Identify significant changes in frog populations and measure pond characteristics that may influence breeding success.

- Rationale
  - Frogs are a representative predatory amphibian; amphibian status in Britain has declined due to drainage, habitat modification, and pollution.
  - Acidification and aluminum effects on larval stages are a long-standing concern; laboratory and field evidence links acidity to embryonic/larval stress and mortality.
  - Adult monitoring is difficult; spawning and egg masses provide a practical proxy for colony size (with assumptions about eggs per mass and sex ratio).

- Method (overview)
  - Location: one or more shallow ponds or ditches known to breed frogs, chosen for accessibility and prior breeding.
  - Monitoring frequency:
    - Weekly checks from around January 1 (or local starting date) to determine when males gather and begin calling.
    - If possible, daily visits from first spawning until eggs hatch; at minimum weekly visits when daily monitoring is not feasible.
  - Spawn tracking:
    - Record the date of first spawn appearance.
    - Daily or weekly counts of new spawn masses; mark each new mass with a colored thread to avoid double counting.
    - Estimate total surface area of water covered by spawn masses; record percentage of dead or diseased eggs.
    - If there are more than 100 masses or visits are infrequent, estimate only the total surface area covered.
    - Record the date when embryos first hatch and continue monitoring until metamorphosed frogs are seen leaving the pond or for 16 weeks from first spawn, whichever shorter.
  - Physico-chemical monitoring (at first spawning):
    - Take a 250 mL water sample from the spawning area for baseline chemical analysis.
    - Measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water; filter sample per protocol and analyze for a suite of ions and related parameters (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon).
    - If unexplained mortality occurs, take a follow-up water sample for the same analyses.
  - In situ pond environment measurements (weekly during monitoring period):
    - pH: measure at three random positions near the pond edge, at a depth of ~50 mm.
    - Temperature: use a maximum/minimum thermometer positioned at ~50 mm depth; read weekly and reset.
    - Water depth: measure weekly at the center of the spawning area.

- Equipment
  - Field-ready pH meter and a maximum/minimum thermometer.
  - Water depth measurement pole or an equivalent improvised device.
  - Materials for marking spawn masses (colored thread, bodkin needle).

- Location and site setup
  - Select ponds/ditches with recent breeding activity and easy access for frequent visits.
  - Record site-specific details and ensure repeatable sampling locations for each core measurement.

- Biological data collection (spawn and development)
  - Record-keeping timeline:
    - Date frogs first seen congregating.
    - Date of first spawning.
    - Date of first hatching.
    - Date newly metamorphosed frogs first seen leaving the pond.
  - Data collected at each sampling event:
    - Daily spawn monitoring: number of new spawn masses; total surface area of pond covered by spawn.
    - Health indicators: percentage of dead or diseased eggs.
    - If counts exceed practical limits, shift to area-based estimates.
  - Spawn mass identification: attach a colored thread to the edge of each new mass to prevent double counting.

- Physico-chemical results (at first spawning and ongoing weekly measurements)
  - Measured variables (at initial spawning for baseline; ongoing pH and temperature weekly):
    - pH, conductivity (unfiltered water)
    - Alkalinity
    - Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P
    - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
  - Depth, minimum and maximum temperatures, and pH at multiple pond positions are recorded as part of weekly pond environment data.

- Data specification and recording conventions
  - Core data identifiers (essential for all datasets):
    - Site Identification Code (unique per ECN Site)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., vertebrates – frog spawn)
    - Location Code (replicate sampling point per core measurement)
    - Sampling Date/time (including time when applicable)
  - Core measurement: vertebrates - frog spawn (BF Protocol)
    - Fields include pond ID, sampling date, dates for first spawning, first hatching, and first metamorphosed frogs leaving, counts of new spawn masses, total area covered by spawn, depth at spawn center, minimum/maximum temperatures, pH values at positions, and chemical determinands from initial water sample.
    - Measurements include pH, conductance, alkalinity, ions (and their concentrations), percentage of dead/diseased eggs, and spawn mass counts with specified precision.
  - Recording forms
    - Standard field recording form is available (Appendix II contains an example).

- References and context
  - The BF Protocol draws on cited literature concerning frog biology, breeding phenology, and the effects of pH and aluminum on amphibian development (Beattie et al.; Cooke; Cummins; others).

- Summary of purpose for analysts
  - Provide standardized, time-series data on frog spawning phenology and pond conditions to compare environmental health and policy performance across sites and years.
  - Enable data interoperability through defined core identifiers and recording conventions.
  - Facilitate broader data value by aligning biological indicators with chemophysical pond characteristics for ecological interpretation.
