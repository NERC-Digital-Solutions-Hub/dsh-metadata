# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2021

- The ninth UKCEH land cover map, LCM2021, mapping 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes derived from Biodiversity Broad Habitats (BAP). It is produced annually using automated methods to enable up-to-date monitoring of land cover and change.
- Data are organized into six geospatial datasets (Great Britain and Northern Ireland): three for GB and NI each (10 m Classified Pixels, Land Parcel products, and 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels), plus 1 km summary products. Appendix 3 lists official dataset names.

## Purpose and key concepts

- Purpose: Provide guidance on data production, validation, accuracy, and appropriate use to help users apply LCM2021 outputs in current and future work.
- Core approach: Classification Scenes combined Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images with 10 Context Rasters; classification is automatic using Bootstrap Training and a Random Forest (RF) classifier.
- Annual production aims: Improve temporal consistency, enable change detection, and distinguish real change from random classification errors as the time series matures.
- Overall accuracy: 82.6% (95% confidence interval 82.19%–82.99%) at full thematic detail.

## Datasets and data products

- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Output: per-pixel land cover class via RF with a probability/confidence band.
  - First band: UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier. Second band: associated classification probability/confidence.
  - Not generalized by the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine geometry (e.g., narrow features). Intended for specialist users aware of this caveat.
- Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework (LP Framework).
  - Purpose: provide parcel-level attributes that summarize pixel data within fixed, management-relevant units.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Rasterized version of the Land Parcel data at 25 m resolution with three bands carrying per-parcel information: dominant class (_mode), mean confidence (_conf), and purity (_purity).
- 1 km raster products
  - Summary products derived from 25 m rasters: dominant class and percentage cover for both 21 UKCEH classes and 10 aggregate classes.
  - Percentage cover values are integers; sums may not perfectly equal 100 due to rounding and boundary effects (coastal areas may sum to less than 100).
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Sentinel-2-based seasonal composites (four seasons) with spectral bands, used to drive classification.
  - Some data gaps due to clouds are handled by the classifier’s tolerance for partial spectral information.
- Context Rasters
  - 10  m context rasters (GB and NI) to reduce spectral confusion by adding terrain and proximity information (e.g., height, slope, distance to coast/roads/buildings, foreshore/tidal masks, urban masks, etc.).
- Classification Scenes and tiles
  - GB: 32 Classification Scenes using a modified 100 x 100 km OS tile grid to cover the land surface; some tiles are enlarged to accommodate sea areas and data density.
  - NI: Single 40-band classification Scene covering the Northern Ireland land mass.
- Spatial framework and MMU
  - UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework has a minimum mapping unit of ~0.5 hectares (MMU). Parcels are designed to represent discrete real-world units and typically dominated by a single land cover type.
  - This framework helps reduce classification noise and supports change detection over time.

## Production workflow and methodology

- Bootstrap Training
  - A self-starting training process that uses historic LCM data (LCM2018–LCM2020) to generate training observations automatically, reducing the need for fresh field data.
  - Training data are filtered to parcels with >80% purity and consistent class across the three previous years.
  - Bootstrap data help seed the classifier for new maps while leveraging wall-to-wall historic coverage.
- Random Forest classification
  - RF model trained on labelled parcels; 10,000 samples per class per bag with replacement to balance classes and prevent dominance by common classes.
  - Workflow uses bespoke UKCEH software integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL tools.
  - Output: 10 m Classified Pixel dataset plus parcel-level summaries.
- Validation and quality assurance
  - 35,182 validation points collected across the UK, spanning all 21 classes, from multiple sources (GB countryside survey, National Forest Inventory, Rural Payment Agency data, manual interpretation, and field points).
  - Validation indicates overall accuracy of 82.6% with a 95% CI of 82.19%–82.99%.
- Data accessibility and interpretation
  - Outputs designed to enable self-service exploration and integration into dashboards, reports, or GIS analyses.
  - Outputs are best interpreted with awareness of the MMU, branding differences between UKCEH classes and BAP Broad Habitats, and potential spectral confusion between similar habitats.

## UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP relationships

- The 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are closely related to BAP Broad Habitats but are not identical; some BAP categories are split or merged to align with remote sensing capabilities.
- Appendices provide mapping notes and guidance, including:
  - Specific class definitions and how they relate to BAP Broad Habitats.
  - Cases where UKCEH classes are subdivided to better represent landscape types (e.g., Urban vs Suburban; Heather vs Heather Grassland; Fen vs Bog vs other wetlands).
- For users requiring cross-reference, appendices detail mapping between UKCEH classes and BAP Broad Habitats (including notes on ambiguities and classification challenges).

## Dataset details and attributes (highlights)

- 10 m Classified Pixels
  - Two-band raster: class identifier and confidence/probability value.
- Land Parcel Product
  - Parcel-level attributes include:
    - gid: unique parcel identifier
    - _hist: history of class frequencies within the parcel
    - _mode: most frequent (modal) class within parcel
    - _purity: percentage of modal class within parcel
    - _conf: average confidence per pixel within parcel
    - _stdev: standard deviation of _conf within parcel
    - _agg: aggregate class identifier linking to UKCEH or BAP classes
    - _n: number of 10 m pixels intersecting the parcel
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel Product
  - Three-band rasters carrying per-parcel dominant class, mean confidence, and purity, aligned to parcel boundaries.
- 1 km products
  - Dominant cover (1 band) for UKCEH classes and for Aggregates
  - Percentage cover (21 bands for classes; 10 bands for aggregates)
  - Coarse grid-based summary suitable for broad-scale analysis and change detection.

## Practical usage considerations

- Use of 10 m Classified Pixels
  - Provides rich detail (including narrow features) but is not re-generalized to the LP Framework; suitable for specialist analyses and fine-scale mapping.
- Use of Land Parcel products
  - Provides structured, comparable units for time-series analysis and change detection, aligned with the LP Spatial Framework.
- Cross-referencing with BAP
  - When interpreting results, be mindful of the distinction between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and UK BAP Broad Habitats; consult Appendices for guidance and definitions.
- Data quality and caveats
  - Some spectral confusion is expected between spectrally similar classes (e.g., various grasslands, bogs, and heath; coastal freshwater vs saltwater in tidal zones).
  - Seasonal gaps exist in the Seasonal Composite Images, but the classifier’s multi-band setup tolerates missing data across the four seasons.
  - The accuracy metric is an average across all classes; certain classes (e.g., Neutral Grassland, Bog, Saltmarsh) may show higher or lower producer/user accuracies depending on region and context.
- Temporal use
  - LCM2021 is designed for annual updates; use Bootstrap Training and time-series interpretation to differentiate real change from random mapping noise.
