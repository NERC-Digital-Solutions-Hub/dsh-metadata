# Derwent X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) Sediment Fingerprinting

## Overview
- A dataset of sediment fingerprinting in the River Derwent Catchment, Yorkshire, UK, using X-ray diffraction (XRD) to understand mineralogical composition.
- Samples collected from multiple soil types and in-stream sediment associated with river bars and banks.
- Aim is to characterize mineral presence to support understanding of sediment sources and environmental processes within the catchment.

## Methods

- Collection
  - Grab samples collected around the River Derwent Catchment from different soil types and in-stream sediment from river bars and banks.
- Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation
  - Samples dried, sieved, and powdered.
  - Processed with a Bruker D8 XRD instrument.
- Analytical methods
  - Qualitative phases analysis performed to identify the range of minerals present in each sample.
- Nature and units of recorded values
  - CSV files contain 2 theta values and counts, enabling assessment of mineralogical composition.
- Quality control
  - XRD instrument calibrated; data provided as raw outputs not yet processed with phase tables.
- Data structure
  - CSV files include the name of each sample site; coordinates (location data) are provided for each entry.

## Data Structure and Content

- Sample site metadata
  - Includes site names such as Lower Rye upstream of Derwent confluence, Derwent U/S Rye River, Jugger Howe Soil, Boxa Woods, Spital Beck River, The Beck River, Harwood Dale, Black Beck River, Raisedale Beck, Ledge Beck, River Seph, River Seph soil, River Dewent U/S Black Beck, and others.
- Location data
  - Each site entry includes precise coordinates (X, Y) or equivalent location references.
- Coverage
  - Samples span multiple upstream, bank, and floodplain locations across the Derwent catchment and its tributaries.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Notes

- Data status
  - Raw XRD outputs are provided; they have not been processed using mineral phase tables.
- Calibration
  - The XRD instrument was calibrated, providing a quality-controlled baseline for mineralogical interpretation.
- Data integrity
  - The dataset description includes detailed site naming and coordinates, though some sections of the text contain garbled formatting; core structure and metadata are present for reuse.

## Data Management and Accessibility

- Data format
  - Stored as CSV files containing 2 theta values, counts, and site metadata.
- Metadata and storage
  - Site names and location data are included to support data discovery and integration with other datasets; data are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring Analysts

- Standardised data workflow
  - Establishes a repeatable approach: collection from defined catchment sites, standardized preparation, and raw XRD outputs suitable for subsequent quality assurance and processing.
- Data quality and transparency
  - Calibrated instruments and raw outputs enable independent verification and cross-comparison with other datasets.
- Data accessibility and reuse
  - Site-level metadata and coordinates facilitate integration with maps, reports, and other environmental datasets.
- Value for policy and monitoring
  - Provides raw mineralogical evidence needed to infer sediment sources and transport pathways, supporting monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Recommendations aligned with archetype challenges
  - Raw, well-documented datasets can be combined with additional environmental data to enhance dataset value.
  - Underlying data are exposed (raw XRD outputs and site metadata) to enable broader access and reuse by others.
