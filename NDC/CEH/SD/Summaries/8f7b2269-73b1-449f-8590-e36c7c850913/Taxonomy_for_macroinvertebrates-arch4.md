# Taxonomy for macroinvertebrates in Welsh upland rivers

- Overview
  - Datasets: 66 sites from the Welsh Acid Water Survey network (WAWS) and 44 sites from the Wye catchment.
  - Objective: capture biological responses to gradients in acidity (WAWS) and land-use intensification (Wye).
  - Focus: macroinvertebrate taxonomy and abundance across sites to support ecological analysis and trait-related insights.

- Experimental design / sampling regime
  - Spring sampling in 2012 (WAWS) and 2013 (Wye).
  - 2-minute semiquantitative kick samples collected from riffles to cover major habitats and enable site comparisons.

- Collection methods
  - Invertebrates collected with a standard kick-net (1 mm mesh).
  - Samples preserved on-site with 100% industrial methylated spirit (IMS); laboratory preservation in 70% IMS.
  - Major taxa identified and counted to species or genus where possible; at times to family or higher due to developmental stage or identification difficulty.
  - Field and lab references: Bradley & Ormerod (2002); Weatherley & Ormerod (1987).

- Fieldwork equipment
  - Kick-net and microscopes used for identification.

- Calibration
  - No calibration steps or values reported.

- Analytical methods
  - Visual identification of invertebrates.

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Abundance of invertebrates.
  - Taxonomic details recorded: class, order, family, genus, and species when available; when only family is identified, the genus field mirrors the family name.
  - Some taxa identified at coarse levels (e.g., Oligochaeta, Tricladida); NA assigned for family and genus in these cases.

- Data structure
  - Primary data: flatbed file with nine columns:
    - dataset: data set name
    - site_code: sampling site identifier
    - year: year of collection
    - class: taxonomic class
    - order: taxonomic order
    - family: taxonomic family
    - genus: taxonomic genus
    - taxon_name: finest taxonomic level available
    - abundance: taxon abundance

- Miscellaneous supporting documents
  - DURESS_CU_site_description.csv: site description file with 10 columns (site_code, Name, Eastings, Northings, Grid, Latitude, Longitude, Elevation, Survey, Catchment) providing geospatial context and campaign information.

- Quality control and metadata considerations
  - No explicit quality control steps documented.
  - Data include taxonomic and spatial context to support aggregation, mapping, and trait-based analyses, but users should consider potential gaps in taxonomic resolution and missing metadata for certain taxa.
