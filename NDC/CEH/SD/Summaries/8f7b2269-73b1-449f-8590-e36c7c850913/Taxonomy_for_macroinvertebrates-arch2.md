# Taxonomy for macroinvertebrates in Welsh upland rivers

- Overview
  - Datasets from two surveys: 66 sites in the Welsh Acid Water Survey (WAWS) network and 44 sites in the Wye catchment.
  - Aimed to capture biological responses to environmental gradients: acidity (WAWS) and land-use intensification (Wye).
  - Sampling years: spring 2012 (WAWS) and spring 2013 (Wye).

- Experimental design / Sampling regime
  - WAWS and Wye data collected to assess differences across acidity and land-use gradients, respectively.
  - Kick-sampling strategy targets riffles with 2-minute semi-quantitative samples; designed to sample major habitats and detect inter-site differences.
  - Field preservation using 100% industrial methylated spirit (IMS); lab preservation in 70% IMS.

- Collection Methods
  - Standard kick-net with 1 mm mesh; organisms identified and counted in the lab.
  - Taxonomic identification to species or genus where possible; to family or higher where development or identification was insufficient.
  - Supporting methodological references provided (Bradley & Ormerod, 2002; Weatherley & Ormerod, 1987).

- Analytical Methods
  - Visual (macular) identification of macroinvertebrates in the lab.

- Nature and Units of recorded values
  - Abundance of each taxon.
  - Taxonomic information available at multiple levels: class, order, family, genus, and finest taxon name where possible.
  - When only family-level ID was achieved, the family name is echoed in the genus field; some taxa identified to coarse levels (e.g., Oligochaeta, Tricladida) with NA for family/genus.

- Data structure
  - One flatbed file with nine columns:
    - dataset, site_code, year, class, order, family, genus, taxon_name, abundance

- Supporting documents
  - DURESS_CU_site_description.csv (site details)
  - Site description includes: site_code, Name, Eastings, Northings, Grid, Latitude, Longitude, Elevation, Survey (WAWS or Wye), Catchment

- Site description details (supporting data)
  - Provides geographic coordinates (British National Grid and WGS84), elevation, and campaign information for each site.

- Quality Control and Calibration
  - No formal calibration steps or quality control procedures documented.

- Data provenance and references
  - Field and lab methods grounded in established kick-sampling literature.
  - References linked through CEH Data Catalogue Record; links may not be guaranteed to remain active.

- Implications for environmental monitoring
  - Useful for assessing macroinvertebrate responses across acidity and land-use gradients.
  - Data are suitable for integration with other datasets to enhance monitoring value.
  - Taxonomic resolution varies; consideration needed when deriving trait- or diversity-based metrics.
