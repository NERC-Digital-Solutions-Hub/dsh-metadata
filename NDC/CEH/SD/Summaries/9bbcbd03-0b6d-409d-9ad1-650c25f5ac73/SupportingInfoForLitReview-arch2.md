# Supporting information for interpreting

- Purpose: Document the methodology and data structure for a literature review on knowledge management (KM) practices at the science-policy interface and in environmental science/management, focusing on China and global trends up to 2017.
- Data sources: Web of Science™ (WoS, All databases) and Scopus; ProQuest considered but not used for this stage due to lack of statistical analysis on annual publication counts.
- Search terms and scope: Keywords include 'knowledge exchange (KE)', 'knowledge shar*' (KS), and 'knowledge transfer' (KT); no language restrictions; all document types; publications up to end of 2017.

## Data collection and screening

- Study selection process: Remove duplicates; screen titles and abstracts to filter relevant articles.
- Retained topics: 
  - KM frameworks or practices used within/between organizations
  - Reasons for KM (evidence-based decision making)
  - How knowledge is shared (one-way vs two-way) and delivery mechanisms
  - Factors/challenges affecting KM effectiveness (e.g., psychological factors, incentives)
- Screening criteria: Separate screening tracks for science-policy interface and environmental science; screening based on topic and title relevance.
- Additional search technique: Reverse search of retained articles’ references; none contained the keywords of interest for this study.
- Publication coverage: Searches aimed to identify KM studies in two areas—science-policy interface and environmental science/management in China by December 2017.

## Data outputs and structure

- Data files described:
  1) LitReview_KMTrend_Year — annual KM publication counts (China and global)
  2) LitReview_KMTrend_CountyWoS — top 20 countries by KM publications (annual totals) from WoS
  3) LitReview_KMTrend_CountyScopus — top 20 countries by KM publications (annual totals) from Scopus
  4) LitReview_Env_China_RetainedPublication — retained KM publications in environmental management in China
- Context: The data are prepared to show KM activity over time and by geography, with a focus on environmental science/management contexts and the science-policy interface.
- Notable outcome: No publications were found that met the criteria for the science-policy interface search; consequently, no data file is provided for that category.

## Data quality, interpretation, and limitations

- Methodology: Systematic literature review employed to improve rigor and reproducibility.
- Regional definitions: China includes China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong; UK includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
- Limitations: Results reflect literature up to 2017; absence of science-policy interface publications under the defined criteria; reliance on databases available at the time; ProQuest excluded for this stage due to lack of statistical annual counts.

## Relevance for monitoring and use

- Provides standardised, auditable procedures and data structures for monitoring KM activity related to environmental science and policy interfaces.
- Enables tracking of KM publication trends over time and across major countries, supporting evaluation of policy-relevant knowledge exchange practices and environmental management scholarship.
- Highlights the importance of data accessibility and the need to integrate underlying KM datasets to enhance value and enable broader use by other stakeholders.
