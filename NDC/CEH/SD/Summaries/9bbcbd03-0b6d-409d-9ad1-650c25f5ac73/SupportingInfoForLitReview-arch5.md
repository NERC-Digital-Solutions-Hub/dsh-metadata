# Supporting information for interpreting

- Overview of the literature search and data handling used to analyze knowledge management (KM) trends related to science-policy interfaces and environmental management in China, up to the end of 2017.
- Focused on two major databases (Web of Science and Scopus); ProQuest was considered but not used for this stage due to lacking annual publication statistics.
- Keywords used: knowledge exchange (KE), knowledge shar*, knowledge transfer (KT).
- Searches covered all document types with no language restriction.

## Relevance to data stewards

- Demonstrates a structured approach to collecting, processing, and organizing bibliometric data for reuse.
- Highlights the importance of provenance, documentation, and transparency in data-driven literature reviews.
- Illustrates how data governance concepts (scope, definitions, inclusion criteria) guide reliable dataset construction.

## Data sources and collection methods

- Primary sources: Web of Science (All databases) and Scopus; ProQuest considered but not used for this stage.
- Scope: publications up to December 2017; no language restrictions; China region defined differently across datasets (China, Taiwan, HK combined in some, with UK definitions noted).
- Additional contextual citation: Zheng et al. (2018) Environmental Science & Policy.

## Data management and structure

- Data processing steps:
  - Remove duplicates across databases.
  - Screen titles/abstracts to filter relevance.
  - Retain articles that discuss KM frameworks/practices, rationale for KM, knowledge sharing/delivery, and KM effectiveness factors.
  - Conduct a backward (reverse) search of references; none matched the keyword criteria.
  - Read and analyze retained articles to identify KM activity in environmental management in China through 2017.
- Data quality control: systematic literature review employed to enhance rigor.

## Data files and contents

- LitReview_KMTrend_Year: Annual amount of KM publications globally and in China.
- LitReview_KMTrend_CountyWoS: Top 20 countries by KM publications in Web of Science (annual totals).
- LitReview_KMTrend_CountyScopus: Top 20 countries by KM publications in Scopus (annual totals).
- LitReview_Env_China_RetainedPublication: Information about retained KM publications in environmental management in China.

## Analytical approach

- Data preparation:
  - Deduplication across sources.
  - Title/abstract screening against inclusion criteria.
  - Full-text review where criteria were met.
- Inclusion criteria focused on: KM frameworks/practices, purpose of KM, knowledge sharing mechanisms, and challenges/factors impacting KM effectiveness.
- No fieldwork, experimental calibration, or measurement validation reported.

## Results reporting and transparency

- For science-policy interface searches, no data file is provided in the data repository to show results.
- For environmental management in China, a retained publication dataset is provided.
- Data sharing note: ensures reproducibility but indicates partial deposition of results.

## Context and regional definitions

- China region definitions vary by dataset (China, Taiwan, HK grouped in some analyses; UK region definitions noted as England, Scotland, Wales, NI).
- Emphasizes careful consideration of regional scope when aggregating international KM data.

## Limitations and notes

- The analysis covers publications up to 2017; more recent trends are not included.
- Dependence on WoS/Scopus may miss works indexed elsewhere; ProQuest exclusion may omit some sources with relevant insights.
- No science-policy interface data file deposited in the repository; only the environmental management in China dataset is retained.
