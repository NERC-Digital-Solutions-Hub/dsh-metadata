# Supporting information for interpreting

- Purpose
  - Describes the data collection, search strategy, screening, and data files used for the literature review on knowledge management (KM) trends (LitReview_KMTrend_*) and environmental management in China (LitReview_Env_China_RetainedPublication).

- Data sources and scope
  - Primary databases: Web of Science™ (WoS, All database) and Scopus.
  - ProQuest considered but not used at this stage due to lack of statistical analysis on annual publication counts.
  - Timeframe: articles published up to the end of 2017.
  - Geographic definitions:
    - In LitReview_KMTrend_CountyWoS, China includes China, Taiwan, and UK includes England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland.
    - In LitReview_KMTrend_CountyScopus, China includes China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong; UK includes England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland.

- Search strategy
  - Keywords used: 'knowledge exchange (KE)', 'knowledge shar*' (KS), and 'knowledge transfer' (KT).
  - Search scope: all document types with no language restriction.

- Screening and selection process
  - Remove duplicates between databases.
  - Titles and abstracts screened for relevance.
  - Full-text review retained if at least one topic is discussed:
    - KM frameworks or practices within/between organisations.
    - Reasons for KM (e.g., evidence-based decision making).
    - How knowledge is shared and delivered (one-way or two-way; e.g., expert systems).
    - Challenges/factors affecting KM effectiveness (e.g., psychological factors, incentives).
  - A reverse search of retained articles’ references was conducted; none included the keywords.

- Data quality and limitations
  - No publications were found that matched the science-policy interface KM search; consequently, no data file is provided for those results.
  - Additional contextual information points to a related paper for environment-policy KM in China (Zheng et al., 2018).

- Data management and structure
  - The dataset consists of four files:
    - LitReview_KMTrend_Year: annual amount of KM publications in China and globally.
    - LitReview_KMTrend_CountyWoS: in WoS, total KM publications (searched years) per country (top 20).
    - LitReview_KMTrend_CountyScopus: in Scopus, total KM publications (searched years) per country (top 20).
    - LitReview_Env_China_RetainedPublication: retained KM publications related to environmental management in China.
  - Methodological approach: systematic literature review to improve rigor of search results.
  - Data handling: duplicates removed; titles/abstracts screened; full texts reviewed based on relevance criteria.
