# Supporting information for interpreting

## Objective and scope
- Describes the data collection and analysis procedures used to interpret knowledge management (KM) literature related to the science-policy interface and environmental science/management, focusing on China and global trends up to 2017.

## Data sources and search strategy
- Databases used: Web of Science (All) and Scopus; ProQuest considered but not used for the statistical stage because it does not provide annual publication counts.
- Keywords: "knowledge exchange" (KE), "knowledge shar*" (KS), "knowledge transfer" (KT).
- Coverage: all document types, no language restriction, up to end of 2017.
- Geographic definitions (vary by database): China includes China, Taiwan, Hong Kong; UK includes England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland.
- Screening workflow: remove duplicates; screen titles/abstracts; retain for full-text review if discussing KM frameworks/practices, reasons for KM (evidence-based decision making), how knowledge is shared/delivered, or challenges/factors affecting KM effectiveness.
- Additional search step: reverse search of retained articles; none found that matched criteria.

## Science-policy interface results
- No publications matched the science-policy interface criteria; consequently, no data file is provided for this category.

## Environmental science and management results (China)
- The literature identified through the above searches was refined to identify KM publications relevant to environmental management in China.
- Retained publications are compiled in LitReview_Env_China_RetainedPublication.

## Data structure and datasets
- Four data files:
  - LitReview_KMTrend_Year: annual amount of KM publications in China and globally.
  - LitReview_KMTrend_CountyWoS: in Web of Science, annual KM publications by country (top 20).
  - LitReview_KMTrend_CountyScopus: in Scopus, annual KM publications by country (top 20).
  - LitReview_Env_China_RetainedPublication: retained KM publications focusing on environmental management in China.
- Notes on data interpretation: country groupings are defined as above for the respective databases.

## Analytical methods and quality control
- Methodology: systematic literature review to enhance rigor.
- Steps: remove duplicates, screen titles/abstracts, apply predefined screening criteria, read full texts to determine relevance to KM practice in environmental management or science-policy interface, and perform reverse citation checks.

## Findings and limitations
- Science-policy interface: no eligible publications found; no data file produced for this category.
- Environmental management in China: exists as retained publications (specifics not detailed in this document).
- Limitations: data limited to publications up to 2017; some datasets rely on specific database definitions and country groupings; ProQuest not used for statistical outputs.
