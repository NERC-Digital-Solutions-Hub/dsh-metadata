# Supporting information for interpreting

- Purpose
  - Describes the methodology and data structure for interpreting KM (knowledge management) literature trends, focusing on science-policy interface and environmental management in China, using a systematic literature review.

- Data sources
  - Databases used: Web of Science™ (All databases) and Scopus. ProQuest was considered but not used for this stage because it does not provide statistical analysis on annual publications.
  - Scope includes articles up to end of 2017; no language restriction applied.

- Search strategy
  - Keywords: 'knowledge exchange' (KE), 'knowledge shar*' (KS), 'knowledge transfer' (KT).
  - Coverage: all document types.
  - Geography and country definitions:
    - China: China, Taiwan, Hong Kong.
    - UK: England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland (and broader UK groupings as noted in WoS).
  - Separate searches and merging were performed for science-policy interface and environmental science/management.

- Screening and selection process
  - Duplicates removed; titles and abstracts screened for relevance.
  - Full-text review retained articles if they addressed:
    1) KM frameworks/practices within/between organizations,
    2) rationale for KM (evidence-based decision making),
    3) how knowledge is shared/delivered (e.g., one-way vs two-way, via expert systems),
    4) challenges/factors affecting KM effectiveness (e.g., incentives, psychological factors).
  - Reverse citation search conducted; no additional relevant articles found.
  - Retained articles analyzed to determine KM practices in environmental management in China by December 2017.
  - Note: For science-policy interface, no publication matched the criteria; no data file for this subset.

- Data structure and contents
  - Four data files:
    1. LitReview_KMTrend_Year — annual KM publication counts for China and globally.
    2. LitReview_KMTrend_CountyWoS — top-20 countries by total KM publications (World) across searched years, from Web of Science.
    3. LitReview_KMTrend_CountyScopus — top-20 countries by total KM publications (World) across searched years, from Scopus.
    4. LitReview_Env_China_RetainedPublication — retained KM publications specifically in environmental management for China.
  - Nature of data: literature-review counts/records suitable for aggregation and mapping trends by year and by country.

- Quality control
  - Systematic literature review used to enhance rigor and reproducibility of search and screening.

- Context and references
  - Additional contextual information cited: Zheng Y, Naylor LA, Waldron S, Oliver DM. Knowledge management across the environment-policy interface in China: what knowledge is exchanged, why, and how is this undertaken? Environmental Science & Policy, 2018.

- Limitations and notes for GIS use
  - Data are aggregated at country level (not sub-national), limiting fine-grained spatial analysis.
  - Results up to 2017; may not reflect more recent trends.
  - No data file provided for science-policy interface results; only environmental management in China is retained.
  - Definitions of countries/regions differ between databases and need harmonization when mapping.
