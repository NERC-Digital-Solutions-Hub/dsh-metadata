# Supporting information for interpreting

- Systematic literature review of knowledge management (KM) trends related to science-policy interface and environmental science/management.
- Timeframe and scope: articles published up to the end of 2017; searches used two main databases and considered a third, with no language restriction and inclusion of all document types.

## Data sources, search strategy, and scope
- Primary databases: Web of Science (WoS, All databases) and Scopus; ProQuest considered but not used for this stage due to lack of statistical data on annual KM publications.
- Keywords: "knowledge exchange" (KE), "knowledge shar*" (KS), and "knowledge transfer" (KT).
- Targeted topics: KM practices at science-policy interfaces and KM within environmental science and management.
- Geographic scope definitions: China in WoS includes China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong; in Scopus, China includes China, Taiwan, and UK includes England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland.

## Data collection and screening process
- Deduplication of results across databases.
- Title and abstract screening to filter relevance.
- Full-text review retained articles that address:
  - Types of KM frameworks or practices used within/between organizations.
  - Rationale for KM (e.g., evidence-based decision making).
  - How knowledge is shared and delivered (one-way or two-way; via systems).
  - Challenges/factors affecting KM effectiveness (e.g., psychological factors, incentives).
- Reverse citation search performed; none of the retrieved articles matched the criteria based on keywords.
- No publications identified for the science-policy interface matching the criteria; therefore, no corresponding data file is provided for this category.

## Data structure and outputs
- The dataset comprises four files:
  1. LitReview_KMTrend_Year – annual KM publication counts globally and for China.
  2. LitReview_KMTrend_CountyWoS – top 20 countries by KM publications per year (WoS).
  3. LitReview_KMTrend_CountyScopus – top 20 countries by KM publications per year (Scopus).
  4. LitReview_Env_China_RetainedPublication – retained KM publications in environmental management for China.

## Data quality and methodology
- Approach: systematic literature review to enhance rigor and reproducibility.
- Fieldwork, laboratory instrumentation, and calibration steps: not applicable (N/A).

- Note: For science-policy interface, no data file is provided due to absence of qualifying publications within the search criteria.
