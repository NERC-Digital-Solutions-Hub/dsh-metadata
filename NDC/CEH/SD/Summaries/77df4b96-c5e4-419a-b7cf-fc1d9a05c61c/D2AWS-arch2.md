## Variables in dataset
- DATID: Data set identification record number.
- NO_REC: Number of recordings used to establish the values.
- REC_TIME: Date of reading (DD-MM-YYYY).
- REC_HOUR: Hour of reading (0–23).
- SOL_RAD: Solar radiation (W/m^2).
- AIR_TEMP: Air temperature (°C).
- DEP_TEMP: Temperature depression (°C) — dry-wet bulb difference.
- WIND_VEL: Wind velocity (km/h).
- WIND_DIR: Wind direction.
- RAINFALL: Rainfall (mm).

## Data quality and gaps
- There are missing values; reasons unknown due to historic nature.
- QA procedures for the dataset are not documented.

## Implications for monitoring and use
- Suitable for assessing historical environmental conditions and comparing with standards over time.
- Requires cleansing, quality assurance, and potential standardisation before integration with other datasets.
- Should be stored in appropriate data portals/datasets to enable broader access, as per monitoring best practices.
