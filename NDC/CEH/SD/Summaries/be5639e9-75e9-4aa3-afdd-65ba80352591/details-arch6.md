## Data description
- Location: Abandoned village of Buryakovka, Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine
- Coordinates: 51.38269 N, 29.924879 E (WGS84)
- Equipment: A single Wildlife Acoustics SM3 Songmeter
- Recording setup: On an overgrown unpaved road near abandoned houses; near deciduous trees
- Recording span: One continuous 12-hour recording on 25/06/2015 (12:00–24:00)
- Annotation: Manually annotated by a single expert using Raven Pro
- Data formats: Stereo WAV files sampled at 48 kHz
- Dataset size: Five WAV files included
- Annotations: Five corresponding text files (same base names as the WAV files); annotations only on channel one

## File structure and formats
- WAV files: Five stereo audio files at 48 kHz
- Annotation files: Five text files (tab-separated), same naming as corresponding WAV files
- Annotation content: Tables with columns including:
  - Begin Time (s) and End Time (s): start and end of each vocalisation tag
  - Low Freq (Hz) and High Freq (Hz): frequency range of the vocalisation
  - Sound category 1: tag/category for the vocalisation
  - Additional information: contextual notes (e.g., low-level vocalisation)
  - Channel: annotations made on channel one

## Annotation details and data quality
- Method: Manual annotation by a single expert
- Tools: Raven Pro used for tagging; tags can be imported into Raven Pro for analysis
- Scope: Annotations cover time, frequency, and categorical labels for vocalisations
- Channel specificity: Annotations apply to channel one of the two stereo channels

## Potential uses for data support
- Studying bird vocalisation activity in a high-contamination/unique environment (Chernobyl Exclusion Zone)
- Integrating with other environmental or ecological datasets for broad policy or conservation analyses
- Creating data products for end users (e.g., dashboards or reports) to explore vocalisation patterns
- Reuse and sharing: clear citation via DOI and Raven Pro compatibility promotes reuse and integration into broader datasets

## Considerations for reuse and provenance
- Provenance: Data collected in 2015 with a single annotator; detailed time, frequency, and category annotations provided
- Accessibility: Hosted via NERC EIDC with clear citation
- Limitations: Annotations limited to channel one and performed by one expert; potential for further labeling or cross-validation by additional experts
- Citation guidance: Attribute to Kendrick et al. (2018) and the DOI when using the data in analyses or publications
