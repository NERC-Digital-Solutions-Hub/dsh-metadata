# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope: Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field surveys, culminating in the 2007 methodology. Emphasises the link between sampling design, land classification, and the ability to produce national and country-specific habitat estimates for Great Britain.

- Core concept: Stratified, random sampling anchored by a land-class framework. Sampling units are 1 km squares chosen to be representative of land classes, enabling robust estimates of habitat areas and changes over time.

- Why stratification matters: Stratified sampling reduces bias from extreme variability and ensures representation of different ecological land types (and, later, country-specific units), improving precision of national and regional estimates.

- Historical progression of the Land Classification and sampling:
  - 1978 (Initial survey): 32 ITE land classes derived from environmental attributes; centre 1 km square classified, plus four surrounding squares; total of 6039 km squares classified; eight samples per class (256 total) for national habitat estimates.
  - 1984 (Second field survey): framework reused; 12 squares per class (384 total); national estimates still based on the 1978 classification.
  - 1990 (All Squares classification; CS1990): expanded to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed; incorporation of satellite-derived Land Cover Map; results published later; national estimates aligned with the new, broader classification.
  - 1998 (Revised classification; CS1990 updates): Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; support for Scotland-only reporting introduced; national estimates aligned with the updated framework.
  - 2000 (CS2000; separate country estimates): framework adapted to produce England & Wales vs. Scotland country units; land classes subdivided and re-allocated into country-specific variants; 40 strata (later 45) with added squares to ensure adequate representation; uplands module added to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - Wales-focused adjustments: increased Welsh sampling to enable Wales-only reporting; added new country-unit class subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); more Welsh squares allocated; some English classes adjusted due to Welsh sampling changes.
  - 2007 (CS2007; devolution refinements): Wales reporting formalised with further class subdivisions and sampling (total of 45 strata); additional Welsh squares; adjustments to English strata to maintain balance; Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country unit.

- Data and outputs:
  - Series of national and country-specific estimates across surveys (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - Documentation of class descriptions, maps, and sampling distributions (Figures and Tables referenced throughout).
  - Appendices provide a brief, detailed history of the ITE Land Classification development and its application.

- National estimates and methodological notes:
  - Changing the underlying Land Classification affects comparability of national estimates; for consistency, national estimates are best derived using the latest classification, while earlier surveys used the original 1990 framework.
  - The CS2000 and CS2007 adjustments explicitly address country-level reporting (England & Wales, Scotland) and Welsh-specific reporting, respectively, impacting how results are interpreted and compared over time.

- Governance and data stewardship implications:
  - Provenance and versioning: clear documentation of which Land Classification version was used for each survey and how class definitions changed over time.
  - Metadata and lineage: maintaining crosswalks between classifications across years to support longitudinal analyses.
  - Country-specific reporting: handling devolution-driven splits requires careful data management to ensure transparent, reproducible country estimates.
  - Data updates: upland modules and additional sampling require ongoing governance around updating datasets, maps, and associated estimates.
  - Documentation availability: substantial methodological detail is captured in main reports (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) and accompanying appendices; ongoing data custodians should preserve this context for interpretation and reuse.

- Appendix and further reading:
  - The document includes a detailed appendix with a brief history of the ITE Land Classification, and extensive references to methodological developments and reporting on Countryside Survey results.
