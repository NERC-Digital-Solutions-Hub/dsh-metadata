# A1.1. Soil Core Sampling Protocol for X-Plots

## Overview
- Standardised soil sampling procedure for environmental monitoring across 120 squares (X-plots) to support data quality, comparability, and policy-relevant analysis.
- Includes equipment, core-specific sampling methods, composite sampling, storage, and dispatch to labs, with notes for quality assurance and traceability.

## Equipment
- Electric Cold Box (kept cool via vehicle charger); mains charger for accommodation
- Field tools: 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs of pliers, mallet, regular trowel, long thin trowel, notebook & pen, parcel tape
- Spare cores and a pack with:
  - X-plot packs with cores, end caps, labelled bags
  - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots
- Packaging: sample bags and mail bags for each core type

## Sampling procedure (per X-plot)
- Location: take cores approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat; perform in every X-plot (5 sampling locations per square including a composite).
- For each X-plot, collect four cores (and four sample bags) in the following order:
  - Core C: BLACK, 15 cm long × 5 cm diam
  - Core F: SHORT WHITE, 8 cm long × 4 cm diam (keep litter layer intact)
  - Core N: LONG WHITE, 15 cm long × 4 cm diam
  - Core P: LONG GREY, 15 cm long × 4 cm diam (must be right way up with bevelled end on soil surface)
- Core collection steps:
  - Clear surface vegetation
  - Insert pipe upright; cut bottom edge with knife if needed
  - Push pipe into ground to full depth; place grey plastic plate on top
  - Hammer to level with soil surface; if depth insufficient, move sampling point and record the change
  - If pipe breaks, use a spare pipe
  - Remove pipe carefully to avoid soil loss; scrape exterior of pipe
  - Cap ends of pipe as samples are retrieved; seal the sample bags
- Composite soil sample (for the square):
  - 8–10 sub-samples collected with the long thin trowel along the 5 m quadrat boundary to a depth of 15 cm
  - Place sub-samples into a single bag, fill to the top white panel
  - If depth or depth uniformity is insufficient, collect more sub-samples until the bag is full
  - If issues arise (vegetation, cow pat, boulder), move to a more sensible location and record the problem
- If any issues arise, record a note in the envelope attached to the sample

## Composite sampling details
- Move vegetation as required to access the soil surface
- Use the long thin trowel to form a 15 cm depth square (width of trowel)
- Leverage soil and collect into the labelled bag
- If ground is very stony, relocate and document the reason

## Soil sample storage and dispatch
- Core C (BLACK): store in its bag; after all black cores for a square, aggregate in a spare plastic bag; store in a cardboard box in the vehicle; keep cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator
- Core F (SHORT WHITE): bag with other short white cores from the square; store in cool box; after all five samples are collected, place in the CEH Lancaster mailbag, seal, and post promptly
- Core P (GREY): bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in cool box; after all five samples are collected, place in the CEH Lancaster mailbag, seal, and post promptly
- Core N (WHITE): bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in cool box; after all five samples are collected, place in the CEH Bangor mailbag, seal, and post promptly
- Soil Sample Bag: place in the cool box immediately; send to CEH Lancaster as soon as possible
- Posting rules:
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If last post is not feasible on Thursday, place in cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post on Fridays
  - If local post boxes don’t accept the package, use a convenient Post Office
  - Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Office locations

## Data quality and data access considerations (Analysts Monitoring the Environment perspective)
- Ensures standardized, repeatable sampling locations, depths, and core types to enable consistent, comparable datasets over time.
- Detailed recording of any sampling issues (unusual vegetation, obstacles) supports data provenance and error tracking.
- Clear labeling, sealing, and storage rules facilitate traceability from field collection to lab analysis and data portals.
- Composite sampling protocol provides a representative bulk sample while allowing integration with core-specific analyses.
- Storage and posting workflows ensure timely delivery to regional coordinators and laboratories (CEH Lancaster/Bangor), supporting timely data readiness for environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
