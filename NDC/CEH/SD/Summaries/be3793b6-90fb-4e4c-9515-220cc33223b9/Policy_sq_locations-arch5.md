# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- CS partners include CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled by CEH under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release and precision levels
- Location data can identify whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone); four-digit grid references may be released to show the 10x10 km grid square.
- Six-digit (precise) locations are only released in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may process requests to avoid releasing locations.
- Spatial data inside squares (e.g., habitat maps) could also reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional access terms as six-digit data.
- If exceptional release is approved, license terms must reflect confidentiality and usage restrictions; four-digit releases have lighter IP/confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- Upon licence expiry, organisations must confirm destruction of location data.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project-management standards equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have terms similar to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality threshold.
- Licensees must not attempt to derive exact locations from the data or claim they have done so.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licenses with appropriate clauses.
- Licences require sign-off by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to offer reasonable pre-processing analysis support within moderate demand; other organisations’ requests are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to work with CS location data; CEH involvement may be direct or advisory and negotiable by case.
