# Sampling design

## Overview
- Soils were sampled in Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
- 256 squares sampled in 1978/1998; all 591 CS squares sampled in 2007, with not all measurements on all samples.
- Power analyses conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sampling framework and locations
- Sampling targets CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 x-plots randomly spaced.
- x-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses, soil types, etc.
- Some plots relocated over time due to destruction, access denial, or relocation uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Samples from a location come from the same site (within ~2–3 m), around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot at each sampling location.

## Sampling method and depth
- Top 15 cm of soil sampled (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998/2007 used a soil core hammered into the soil and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit with soil from the top 15 cm.
- Stones or shallow soils occasionally prevented full core collection.
- In 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were recorded for some cores.

## Measurements and lab analyses
- 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (as detailed in Table 1).
- No chemical analyses by soil horizons; samples were homogenised before pH and LOI.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method).
- Data table (Table 1) lists measurements such as pH, LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, etc. Some measurements were taken across all 591 squares; others only for the original 256 squares or specific x-plots.

## Statistical analysis and interpretation
- Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock and change of the population, while including land classes yields weighted national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses.
- CS design emphasizes dispersion rather than detailed spatial structure; a mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to handle multiple x-plots per square.
- For regional estimates, widespread sampling improves precision and coverage.
- Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review published CS work available on the CS website.

## Data availability and limitations
- Some measurements/data were released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.
