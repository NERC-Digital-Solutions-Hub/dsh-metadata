# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- The policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data remains publicly accessible.
- The aim is to maximise public interest utility while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity, which are essential for sampling representativeness, scientific integrity, environment protection, and ongoing landowner permission.

## CS Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Confidentiality rationale
- Location confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release and precision levels
- Access may reveal whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) at coarse resolution.
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit grid references are released only when absolutely essential; external requests may require pre-processing by CEH to avoid releasing precise locations.
- In VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, location information may be released externally under licence if the requester proves that their data/IP protections are equal or higher in confidentiality than the CS data.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) can similarly identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional access terms.

## Specific release conditions
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are granted for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licence.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm in writing that data was secure and destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check compliance by landowners.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; both types include restrictions preventing reverse identification of exact square locations.

## Roles, governance, and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hard-copy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with the required confidentiality clauses.
- Licences must be signed by an authorised senior signatory from the licensee.
- If approval is denied, the decision follows the Act and Regulations processes to support the outcome.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications for location data and the grounds for decisions.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing needs within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; external requests are considered case-by-case.
- Prospective users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to work with data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
