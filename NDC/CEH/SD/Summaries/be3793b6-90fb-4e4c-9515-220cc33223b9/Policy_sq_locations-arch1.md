# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy to maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Current partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey access and permissions.
- Public interest rationale; handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Access supports identifying which survey squares fall into predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must show that related data/assets have equal or higher confidentiality protection; CEH can perform pre-processing to avoid releasing exact locations.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) can potentially reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed at the end of the licensing period.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP-confidentiality threshold of six-digit releases; still, users must not derive precise locations or claim to have done so.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, approves exceptional releases and issues hard-copy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision rationale.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; external requests are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to CS location data work; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid and negotiable.

## How to engage
- Contact CEH to discuss needs and feasibility of using location data.
- For internal CS partnership use, CEH aims to offer timely pre-processing analysis; external requests evaluated individually.

## Practical implications for analysts
- Access to precise location data is restricted and granted via licensed, case-specific arrangements.
- When possible, use pre-processing analysis to answer questions without exposing exact locations.
- Plan for potential delays and required governance steps; ensure compliance with confidentiality requirements and JCOP-aligned standards.
- Maintain clear provenance, licensing terms, and destruction confirmations at project end.
