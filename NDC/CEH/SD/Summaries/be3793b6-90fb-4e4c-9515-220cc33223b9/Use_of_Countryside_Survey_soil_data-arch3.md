# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Overview
- Documents the sampling design, sampling processes, measurements, and statistical analysis considerations for CS soils in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
- Includes power analyses to determine sampling requirements for detecting significant change.
- Aims to support policy scrutiny, monitoring decisions, and future evaluation of environmental health measures.

## Sampling design
- Soils sampled in three years: 1978, 1998, 2007.
- 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to 591 squares.
- Power analyses determined the number of samples needed to detect significant change (see Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sample location and repeat identifiers
- Soils sampled from CS x-plots: five x-plots per CS square, randomly spaced.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses, soils, etc.
- Some plots relocated over time due to land use changes or access issues.
- Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1); samples with the same ID come from the same location, though actual sampling points are ~2–3 m apart around a 2 m x 2 m marked plot.
- Relocation and access issues affect the continuity of exact sampling points across years.

## Sampling methods
- Sampling depth: top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998/2007 used soil cores hammered in and extracted; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Stones or shallow soils could prevent full core collection.
- In 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were recorded for some cores (black cores, N mineralization cores).

## Measurements (by year and core handling)
- 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores carried different measurements (Table 1).
- No chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 (not by ISO bulk density method due to practical constraints).
- Data structure includes varied measurements across cores and plots; full details listed in Table 1 and associated reports.
- Some measurements datasets restricted: data for certain measurements released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).

## Measurements in 2007 (examples)
- pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, %C, %N, Bulk density, Core dimensions, Photograph, Depth of organic layer, Hand texture, Soil moisture, Olsen P, Metals, Mineralisable N, among others.
- Some measurements available for all 591 squares; others limited to original 256 squares or subsets of x-plots within squares.

## Data handling, metadata, and release
- Metadata quality varies; older datasets may have incomplete metadata, complicating verification and reuse.
- Some datasets require aggregation or weighting by land class structure to produce national estimates.
- Data structure is complex due to multiple cores per square and disparate measurements; users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and review existing CS publications and the CS website for data usage guidance.
- Some data are restricted and released only after the November 2009 Soils Report.

## Statistical analysis guidance
- Analyses must account for land class structure to avoid biased stock/change estimates.
  - Ignoring land classes can yield population-level stock/change results rather than national estimates.
- Mixed models recommended: include square as a random factor to reflect multiple x-plots per CS square.
- Design considerations: CS uses dispersed observations; when regional estimates are needed, widespread sampling improves precision and coverage.
- Bootstrapping not universally applied; consult CEH and related CS publications for appropriate methodologies.

## Practical implications for monitoring framework authors
- Emphasizes the importance of:
  - Establishing a repeatable sampling framework across years with clear repeat identifiers.
  - Planning sampling density and power to detect changes over time.
  - Ensuring data are accompanied by robust metadata and governance to enable reuse.
  - Clearing pathways for data sharing while balancing access constraints and release timelines.
- Highlights the necessity of integrating data governance, metadata standards, and clear communication of complex results for policy-relevant monitoring.
