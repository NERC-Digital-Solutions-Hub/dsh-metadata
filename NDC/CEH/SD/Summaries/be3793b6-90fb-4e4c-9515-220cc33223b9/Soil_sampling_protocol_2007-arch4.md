# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Overview for data leaders: The section lists equipment and materials required to collect and transport soil core samples from X-plots, ensuring samples remain cool and properly labeled for subsequent data management, storage, and dispatch.
- Equipment and purpose:
  - Electric Cold Box (kept cool by vehicle power) and mains charger for accommodation
  - Tools: 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs of pliers, mallet, regular trowel, long thin trowel, parcel tape, spare cores
  - Documentation and packaging: notebook & pen, 1 pack for the appropriate square with X-plots cores, end caps, labelled bags, stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots
- Data implications:
  - Clear mapping between physical samples and digital records via precise labeling and packaged bags
  - Ensure materials support consistent data collection workflows and traceability

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Overview: Describes how soil cores are sampled and positioned relative to the center quadrat in each X-plot, with procedures to handle issues and maintain data quality.
- Core types and positions:
  - Core C (Black): 15 cm long, 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the center quadrat corner
  - Core F (Short White): 8 cm long, 4 cm diameter; 15 cm east of the Black core; leaves litter layer intact
  - Core N (Long White): 15 cm long, 4 cm diameter; 15 cm south of Core C (30 cm from south corner)
  - Core P (Long Grey): 15 cm long, 4 cm diameter; 15 cm west of Core C; right orientation with bevelled end on soil surface
- Sampling process:
  - Collect 4 cores per X-plot, with 5 sampling locations per square
  - Use labeled bags; place caps on ends; seal samples
  - Record any problems (e.g., vegetation, roots, boulders) in the envelope
  - Maintain careful technique to prevent soil loss, especially in dry/sandy soils
- Composite soil sample:
  - 8–10 sub-samples along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat; depth 15 cm
  - Fill a bag to the top white panel; if short, collect more samples
  - Bag is sealed in double bags and labeled
- Data implications:
  - Precise spatial references and core identifiers enable accurate geospatial and depth-related data linking
  - Documentation of anomalies ensures data quality and transparency for future analysis

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Overview: Procedures for storing, batching, and preparing samples for transport to labs, with per-core handling rules.
- Core storage by type:
  - Core C (Black): stored in its own bag; later grouped with other black cores in a spare bag; kept cool in a box, away from direct sunlight until regional transfer
  - Core F (Short White): placed with other short white cores in a larger bag; stored in the cool box; post with CEH Lancaster
  - Core P (Grey) and Core N (White): stored with their respective groups; ready for mailing to CEH Lancaster or Bangor
  - Soil Sample Bag: stored in the cool box; posted to CEH Lancaster
- Mail & dispatch:
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If last post day is Thursday for posting, wait until Monday; do not post on Friday
  - If local post boxes cannot accommodate, use a Post Office; verify post offices via OS maps or Road Atlas
  - Samples are posted in mailbags labeled for the designated CEH lab location

# Data management and governance implications for Data Leaders

- Standardization and traceability:
  - Use consistent core labeling, bags, and mailbags to maintain a clear chain of custody and enable reliable data integration
- Metadata and documentation:
  - Capture precise spatial references, core type, depth, position relative to center quadrat, and any field notes about issues
  - Record anomalies (vegetation, roots, rocks) to support data quality assessments
- Data quality and integrity:
  - Follow strict procedures to minimize sample loss or misidentification; have spare cores as contingency
  - Composite sampling and depth consistency are essential for comparable data across squares
- Storage, discoverability, and stewardship:
  - Maintain organized storage by core type with cooling and proper labeling to ensure easy retrieval
  - Timely dispatch and clear mailing instructions support timely data availability for analysis
- Collaboration and coordination:
  - Documentation and standardized procedures facilitate cross-team use and potential replication or expansion across networks
- Potential risks and mitigations:
  - Risk of mislabeling or lost samples: enforce labeling discipline and use spare materials
  - Delays in posting: adhere to posting windows and plan logistics with post office options

# End notes

- The procedures emphasize meticulous labeling, sampling at defined locations, careful field technique to preserve sample integrity, and timely, well-documented posting to laboratories, all of which are critical for reliable data capture, management, and downstream analysis.
