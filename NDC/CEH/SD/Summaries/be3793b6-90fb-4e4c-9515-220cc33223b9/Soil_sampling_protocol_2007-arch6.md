## A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Sampling location: approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot; five sampling locations per square.
- If issues arise (e.g., large roots, unusual vegetation), note in the envelope (e.g., “1st soil core taken 1 m E of centre quadrat”) and adjust minimally to achieve a homogeneous location.
- Core-taking procedure (for each core):
  - Use the correct labelled bag for the X-plot; clear surface vegetation.
  - Insert pipe upright; cut bottom edge with knife; push into soil through roots.
  - If ground is very stony, move sampling point and record.
  - Push pipe to stand upright; place grey plastic plate on top and hammer until core is level with surface.
  - If insufficient depth, move point and repeat; use spare pipes if needed.
  - Remove pipe carefully to avoid soil loss; scrape exterior of pipe.
  - If needed, cut bottom end of core to level with pipe end; seal ends with caps; return to plastic bag.
  - Repeat for each centre quadrat in the square (5 sampling locations per square).

- Core types and locations:
  - Core C: BLACK, 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter; 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner.
  - Core F: SHORT WHITE, 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter; 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact.
  - Core N: LONG WHITE, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter; 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from south corner).
  - Core P: LONG GREY, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter; 15 cm west of the black core; oriented with bevelled end on soil surface.

- Composite soil sample (120 squares only):
  - A single bag containing 8–10 sub-samples from along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat.
  - Sub-samples collected with the long thin trowel, 15 cm depth; 8–10 sub-samples with at least 2 on each side of the quadrat.
  - Sub-samples placed into the same bag; fill to the top white panel; seal and, if needed, place in another bag.

- Troubleshooting: move vegetation if needed; record problems in envelope or notes.

## A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Storage after collection (per core):
  - Core C (BLACK): bag individually, then with other black cores in a spare plastic bag; store in cardboard box in vehicle; cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator.
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): bag with other short white cores; store in cool box; after all 5 samples, place in CEH Lancaster mailbag, seal, and post ASAP.
  - Core P (GREY): bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; after all 5 samples, place in CEH Lancaster mailbag, seal, and post ASAP.
  - Core N (WHITE): bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; after all 5 samples, place in CEH Bangor mailbag, seal, and post ASAP.
  - Soil Sample Bag (composite): store in cool box; post to CEH Lancaster as soon as possible.

- General posting/storage notes:
  - Post samples as soon as possible.
  - If last post Thursday is missed, place in cool box over weekend and post Monday; do not post on Friday.
  - If local post boxes cannot take packages, use a Post Office.
  - Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Offices.

- Data/custody considerations:
  - Ensure proper labeling and bagging to maintain traceability.
  - Maintain consistent storage and dispatch pathways to avoid cross-contamination and ensure timely delivery to CEH labs.
