# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise the public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## CS partners (current)
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Preserve future survey capability, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and permission from landowners.
- Confidentiality policy is in the public interest.

## When locations may be released (and at what precision)
- Public access can identify whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to indicate the 10x10 km grid containing a square.
- Six-digit grid references: only in very exceptional circumstances; require CEH to undertake pre-processing to avoid release, unless the requester demonstrates IP confidentiality equivalent to CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats/linear features) carry similar confidentiality and are released only under exceptional terms identical to six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals for approved purposes.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- Post-license, data must be destroyed; licensees must confirm destruction in writing.
- No third-party release that could compromise square locations; if in doubt, consult CEH.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same IP confidentiality as six-digit releases; users must not attempt to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with clauses reflecting this policy.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised official from the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows the Act and Regulations to support the decision.
- CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH will, subject to moderate demand, provide necessary pre-processing support within the CS partnership; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Organisations and potential users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may be direct or consultative, with potential payment or collaboration negotiated case-by-case.
