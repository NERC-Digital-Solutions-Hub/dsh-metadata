# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and securing future landowner permission for surveys.
- Public-interest rationale: requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release levels
- Location data can be released at varying precision:
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence to identify affected grid squares.
  - Six-digit precise locations require demonstration that pre-processing analysis cannot be performed by CEH; extremely exceptional circumstances may allow external release under licence.
  - Spatial data within survey squares could reveal square locations and is treated with the same exceptional constraints as six-digit data.

## License terms and obligations
- Licensees must:
  - Preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
  - Use licences for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed or confirmed destroyed at licence end.
  - Not release data or images that could compromise square confidentiality; not be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.
  - Provide evidence of project management standards (at least JCOP) if required.
  - For four-digit releases, prevent attempts to identify square locations from the data.
- No third-party release that could compromise confidentiality.

## Licensing process and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; decisions signed by a senior authorising official.
- If approval is denied, decisions follow the UK Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- Reasonable pre-processing support may be provided by CEH within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before committing to using data under this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, with case-by-case negotiation.
