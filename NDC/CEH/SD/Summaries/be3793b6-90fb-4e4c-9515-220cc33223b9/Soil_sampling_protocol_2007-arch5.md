# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Electric Cold Box to be kept cool by charging whenever the vehicle is driven (connected to the vehicle lighter socket)
- Mains charger provided for use in accommodation
- Additional equipment and supplies:
  - 2 knives
  - 2 plastic plates
  - Hammer
  - 2 pairs of pliers
  - Mallet
  - Regular trowel
  - Notebook & pen
  - Long thin trowel
  - Parcel tape
  - Spare cores
- Pack for the appropriate square containing:
  - X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags
  - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

Data stewardship considerations:
- Ensure equipment lists and pack contents are captured as part of dataset provenance.
- Track any equipment issues or substitutions during fieldwork to preserve data quality and traceability.

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Cores taken at approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot of every square
- If problems arise or comments are needed (e.g., large tree roots, 1 m east of centre quadrat), place a note in the envelope
- If vegetation or obstructions (cow pat, boulder, etc.) affect sampling, move to a more homogeneous location and record the problem
- Core handling sequence for each core:
  - Use the correct labelled bag for the X-plot; locate 4 cores and 4 sample bags
  - Clear surface vegetation and plant material
  - Cut around the bottom edge with knife; push pipe upright into soil
  - Place grey plastic plate on top; hammer until the core is level with the soil surface
  - If depth is insufficient, move sampling point and start again; use spare pipes as needed
  - Twist/pull pipe free carefully to avoid losing soil; use trowel to prevent soil loss
  - Scrape/remove soil lumps from pipe exterior
  - Trim bottom end if needed to level with pipe end
  - Repeat for each centre quadrat in each X-plot (total of five sampling locations per square)
- Core types and locations:
  - Core C: BLACK, 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter — 15 cm south of the centre quadrat
  - Core F: SHORT WHITE, 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter — 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact
  - Core N: LONG WHITE, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter — 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from south corner)
  - Core P: LONG GREY, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter — 15 cm west of the black core; right way up with bevelled end on the soil surface
- Each core is placed into its respective labelled bag and returned to the plastic bag

Data stewardship considerations:
- Record exact core type, core ID, and spatial relationships between cores for each square and X-plot.
- Capture any anomalies or deviations from the procedure to support data quality assessment.

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- After collection, store cores as follows:
  - Core C (BLACK): store in its bag; once all black cores for a square are collected, store together in a spare plastic bag; keep in a cardboard box in the vehicle, cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): place in its bag with other short white cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples are taken, place in mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster, seal and post promptly
  - Core P (GREY): place in its bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples are taken, place in mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster, seal and post promptly
  - Core N (WHITE): place in its bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples are taken, place in mailbag labeled for CEH Bangor, seal and post promptly
- Composite soil sample bag:
  - Place in the cool box immediately; as soon as possible place in mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster and post
- Posting guidelines:
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If not possible to post by last post on Thursday, place in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post on Fridays
  - If nearest post boxes do not accept packages, use a convenient Post Office
  - Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Offices

Data stewardship considerations:
- Capture precise sample IDs, bag labels, and destination labs (CEH Lancaster, CEH Bangor) to ensure traceability and correct data routing.
- Record posting deadlines and any delays, enabling audit trails and timeliness metrics.
- Ensure storage conditions (cool box, protection from sunlight) are documented as part of sample metadata to support data quality and reproducibility.
