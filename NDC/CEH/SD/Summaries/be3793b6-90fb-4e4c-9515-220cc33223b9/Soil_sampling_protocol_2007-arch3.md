# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Purpose: Support field soil sampling across X-plots, with four cores per square and a composite soil sample, plus proper storage, handling, and dispatch to regional laboratories.
- Key logistical items: Electric Cold Box (powered via vehicle lighter socket), mains charger for accommodation, labelled packs for  X-plots (cores, end caps, bags), stamped/Addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots, and notes/notebook for field records.
- Personal and field tools: 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pliers, mallet, regular and long thin trowels, parcel tape, spare cores, notebook and pen, long thin trowel, spare bags, and appropriate packaging for sample transfer.

## Soil core sampling overview

- Sampling plan: Collect cores from five soil sampling locations per square (center quadrat and four surrounding points) to form a composite dataset; 120 squares in total.
- Problem reporting: If sampling issues arise or unusual vegetation/obstructions are encountered (e.g., large roots, cow pat, boulder), record the problem in the envelope with a brief note.

## Specific core sampling procedures

- Core C: BLACK core (15 cm long, 5 cm diameter)
  - Location: 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner.
  - Handling: Use the black core for distance reference; place in a labelled plastic bag for each X-plot.
- Core F: SHORT WHITE core (8 cm long, 4 cm diameter)
  - Location: 15 cm east of the black core.
  - Handling: Do not disturb the litter layer; cap ends after sampling; seal in its bag.
- Core N: LONG WHITE core (15 cm long, 4 cm diameter)
  - Location: 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner of the centre quadrat).
  - Handling: Cap ends; seal in its bag.
- Core P: LONG GREY core (15 cm long, 4 cm diameter)
  - Location: 15 cm west of the black core; ensure correct orientation with bevelled end on the soil surface.
  - Handling: Cap ends; seal in its bag.

- Composite soil sample
  - Location and method: Collect 8–10 sub-samples along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat to a depth of 15 cm using the long thin trowel; place all sub-samples into a single plastic bag up to the top white panel.
  - Depth and coverage: Ensure a representative composite by sampling around the quadrat on at least two sides, filling the bag to the indicated level.
  - Problem reporting: Record any issues or deviations in the envelope.

- General core handling
  - Clean cores of surface material; record any difficulties with depth or ground conditions.
  - If a core pipe is damaged, replace with a spare pipe provided.
  - Ensure cores are kept whole and free from soil loss at ends; use trowel to assist removal as needed.

## Core labeling and storage instructions

- Labeling: Each core (C, F, N, P) must be placed in its own labelled bag; composite sample stored in a larger bag with other samples from the same square.
- Temporary storage: Store cores in a cool box as you complete sampling for the square; avoid direct sunlight.

## Soil sample storage and dispatch (A1.1.4)

- Core C (BLACK): Store in its bag; once all BLACK cores for the square are collected, keep together in a spare bag; place in the vehicle in a cardboard box; keep cool until return to regional coordinator.
- Core F (SHORT WHITE): Place in its bag with other white cores from the square; store in the cool box; after all cores for the square are collected, send via mailbag to CEH Lancaster.
- Core P (GREY) and Core N (WHITE): Place respective cores in their bags with other long-grey/long-white cores from the square; store in the cool box; post to CEH Lancaster for P and CEH Bangor for N.
- Composite soil sample bag: Place in the cool box immediately; post to CEH Lancaster as soon as possible.

## Posting and transport logistics

- Posting timeframe: Post samples as soon as possible; if last post on Thursday is not feasible, place samples in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday; do not post on Fridays.
- Post office considerations: If nearby post boxes cannot accept packages, use an alternative Post Office; consult OS map data or Road Atlas to locate Post Offices.
- Destination routing: Lancaster shipments typically for F, P, and the composite sample; Bangor shipment for N; ensure accurate labeling and separation by destination.

## Data quality and governance notes (relevant to monitoring-framework perspective)

- Documentation and traceability: Problems and deviations must be documented in envelopes; strict labeling and organization of cores by type and square to maintain traceability.
- Data integrity: Use of sealed bags and controlled storage in a cool box reduces degradation; orientation and handling instructions prevent sample mix-ups.
- Data availability and sharing: The procedure implies sharing core samples with regional laboratories (CEH Lancaster, CEH Bangor) and maintaining organized shipment records for audit and future data use.
- Metadata considerations: While not explicit, the process includes multiple data points (location coordinates relative to center quadrat, core type, sampling depth, date/time, and notes on field conditions) that should be captured and linked to the samples for future analysis.
- Barriers and mitigations: Emphasis on timely posting, proper packaging, and documented notes are designed to mitigate data gaps, mislabeling, and delays that could affect data quality and timeliness.
