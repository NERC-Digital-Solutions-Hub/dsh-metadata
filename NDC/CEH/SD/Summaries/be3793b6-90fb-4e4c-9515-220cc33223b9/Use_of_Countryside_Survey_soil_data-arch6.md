# Sampling design

- Overview
  - Soils sampled in the Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998 and 2007.
  - 256 squares sampled in 1978 and 1998; 591 CS squares sampled in 2007.
  - Not all measurements were made on all samples; power analyses used to determine sample numbers (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots; five x-plots per CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses/types.
  - Some x-plots relocated over time due to destruction, access, or uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Locations across years refer to the same area but are typically 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

- Sampling procedure
  - Soil sampled from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrates).
  - 1998 and 2007 used a hammered soil core; 1978 used a soil pit.
  - In some soils full cores could not be collected due to stones or shallow depth.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements were taken for 2 of the 4 cores.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements (Table 1).
  - No chemical analyses by horizon; samples homogenised before pH/LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO full-core method).
  - A full methods report exists (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Data structure and analysis considerations
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock/change estimates, while including them yields weighted national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping not universally applied.
  - Recommend mixed models with square as random factor to handle multiple x-plots per CS square.
  - Only one core per location; design-based CS approach favors dispersed, widespread sampling for regional precision.
  - Users should consult CEH before analysis and review CS publications (listed on the CS website).

- Data availability and notes
  - Table 1 lists measurements per core; data release notes indicate that certain measurements are released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).
  - Measurements include: LOI, pH (in water & CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, etc.
  - Coverage varies: some measurements available across all 591 squares; others limited to original 256 squares.
