# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aim: maximise utility of CS spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves the representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission from landowners.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released (precision)
- Access may indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references released only in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may preprocess to avoid release; external release requires proof that the IP/confidentiality of the data is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares could identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained to fulfil other responsibilities.
- At licensing end, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and was destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan/visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, evidence of project management standards (at least JCOP) may be requested.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria.

## Licences and use terms
- Four-digit grid reference licences align with the same framework but are less restrictive than six-digit releases.
- Licences include clauses preventing attempts to derive precise square locations or claim to have done so.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; sign-off by a senior authorised official.
- If approval is denied, processes follow the Act and Regulations to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS partnership uses, CEH will endeavour to provide pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe, subject to moderate demand; other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement is not guaranteed but can help define requirements and support appropriate use (collaboration or paid).

## Practical guidance for data support work
- Plan data access and licensing early; ensure handling complies with confidentiality and destruction requirements.
- Consider pre-processing or analysis to minimize need for releasing precise locations.
- Coordinate with CEH/NERC governance for exceptions and licensing timelines.
- Maintain clear documentation of data provenance, license terms, and destruction confirmations.
