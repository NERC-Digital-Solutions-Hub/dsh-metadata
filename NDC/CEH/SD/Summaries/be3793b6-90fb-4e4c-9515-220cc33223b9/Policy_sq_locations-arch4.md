# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protects representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Safeguards scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Confidentiality deemed to be in the public interest; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release permissions and precision levels
- General access can show whether squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit (precise) grid references require pre-processing by CEH; very exceptional cases may allow external release under licence if the requester demonstrates IP confidentiality at least equal to CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, etc.) can similarly be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
- Four-digit releases include safeguards to prevent deriving precise locations and identifying squares.

## License terms and restrictions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed after the licensing period ends, with written confirmation.
- No data or images should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP criteria than six-digit releases; all releases prohibit attempts to identify square locations.

## Roles, governance, and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases according to this policy.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report summarising access requests, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; external requests are case-by-case.
- Organisations are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be pursued as part of collaboration or paid arrangement, negotiated case-by-case.
