# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Outlines the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
  - Emphasises a time-series, standardized approach to monitor environmental condition and policy performance across Great Britain (GB).

- Core methodology: the ITE Land Classification
  - Uses a stratified, random sampling design based on the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative sampling across diverse landscapes.
  - Stratification aims to avoid bias and capture environmental variation (altitude, geology, climate, landform, land use).

- Historical development and key surveys
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - 1 km squares as sampling units; centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid classified.
    - 8 samples per Land Class; total of 256 squares surveyed.
    - Estimations of habitat areas derived from class proportions and per-square means.
  - 1984 (Second survey)
    - 12 squares per class; total 384 squares surveyed (plus previous sites).
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Extended classification to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB (from satellite data).
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Updated classification to support separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland).
    - Sub-divided classes and rebalanced sampling to improve representation; introduced separate country units and additional upland sampling module.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Further adjustments to support Wales-only reporting (Welsh-specific class sub-divisions; increased Welsh sampling).
    - Created 45 strata (up from 40) to accommodate country-specific reporting; implemented additional Welsh squares and refined Wales sub-classes.
    - England had some reductions in per-class samples; overall precision deemed acceptable.

- Country-specific reporting and uplands module
  - Separate country estimates introduced to provide England & Wales vs Scotland results.
  - Wales-specific class sub-divisions and extra Welsh samples to improve Wales reporting accuracy.
  - Uplands module added (CS2000 and beyond) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- How estimates are produced
  - National estimates: sum across Land Classes of (mean habitat area per square in class × total GB area of that class).
  - Country estimates: use country-unit classes with adequate representation; additional targeted sampling ensures reliable Wales and Scotland outputs.
  - Note on consistency: different national classifications can affect across-survey comparability; the 2006 scoping study recommends using the latest classification for internal consistency, while acknowledging cross-survey comparisons may prefer the original classifications.

- Outputs and data handling
  - Outputs include reports, maps, and charts; data are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
  - Emphasis on maintaining a usable time-series dataset to monitor change in environmental features over time.

- Appendix and historical context
  - Provides a brief history of the ITE Land Classification, detailing the evolution from 32 classes (1978) to 40 classes (1990), then to 45 classes (2000), with Wales/Scotland-specific adaptations (2007).
