# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Electric Cold Box (kept cool by charging via vehicle lighter socket)
- Electrical mains charger for accommodation
- 2 knives
- 2 plastic plates
- Hammer
- 2 pairs of pliers
- Mallet
- Regular trowel
- Notebook & pen
- Long thin trowel
- Parcel tape
- Spare cores
- 1 pack for the appropriate square containing:
  - X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags
  - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Cores taken approximately 15 cm S of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot of every square
- If problems arise or comments are needed, note in the envelope (e.g., “large tree roots - 1st soil core taken 1 m E of centre quadrat”)
- If vegetation unusual (cow pat, boulder, etc.), move minimum distance to obtain a homogeneous location and record the problem
- For each core:
  - Use the correct labeled bag for the X-plot; locate 4 cores and 4 sample bags
  - Clear surface of vegetation/fresh plant material
  - Insert pipe upright with bevelled end on soil surface; cut around bottom edge; cut vertically through roots
  - Push pipe firmly into ground until upright
  - Place grey plastic plate on top and hammer to level with soil surface
  - If insufficient depth, move sampling point and record as above
  - If pipe breaks/distorts, use spare pipe
  - Twist/pull pipe free carefully to avoid losing soil from ends
  - Scrape/remove lumps from exterior of pipe
  - If needed, cut bottom end of core to level
  - Repeat for each centre quadrat in each X-plot (total of five soil sampling locations per square)

- Core types and locations:
  - Core C: BLACK, 15 cm long × 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of centre quadrat corner
  - Core F: SHORT WHITE, 8 cm long × 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact
  - Core N: LONG WHITE, 15 cm long × 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the black core
  - Core P: LONG GREY, 15 cm long × 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm west of the black core; kept right way up with bevelled end on soil surface

- All samples are taken in 120 squares
- One composite soil sample (8–10 sub-samples, depth 15 cm) fills the plastic bag up to the top white panel
  - Sub-samples collected with long thin trowel along the 5 m quadrat boundary, evenly around the sides
- If problems occur, note in envelope; adjust location to obtain homogeneous samples

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- After collection, return all 4 cores to the vehicle and store as follows:
  - Core C (BLACK): store in its bag; when all black cores for a square are collected, store together in a spare plastic bag; store in a cardboard box in the vehicle; keep cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): place in its bag, with other short white cores from the square; store in cool box; after all 5 samples are taken, place in mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster and post as soon as possible
  - Core P (GREY): place in its bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; after all 5 samples are taken, place in mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster and post as soon as possible
  - Core N (WHITE): place in its bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; after all 5 samples are taken, place in mailbag labeled for CEH Bangor and post as soon as possible
- Soil Sample Bag (composite sample): place in the cool box immediately; as soon as possible place in mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster and post
- Posting:
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If not postable by the last post on Thursday, place in cool box over weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post on Friday
  - If nearest post boxes cannot take these packages, use a convenient Post Office (check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Offices)
