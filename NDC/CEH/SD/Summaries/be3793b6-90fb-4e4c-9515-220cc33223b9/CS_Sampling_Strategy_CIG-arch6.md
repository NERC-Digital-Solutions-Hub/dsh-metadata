# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- A long-running framework for field surveying across Great Britain, built on the ITE Land Classification to stratify samples and enable national and country-level habitat estimates.
- Emphasizes the need for representative, stratified sampling and for linking ecological classification with survey data to detect change over time.

## Key concepts

- Stratified sampling to minimise bias and ensure representation of different land types and environmental conditions.
- ITE Land Classification: a hierarchical classification of GB land based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) used to define sampling strata.
- Sample unit: 1 km x 1 km squares, selected as centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares added to classify and expand data coverage.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used in early development to form land classes based on vegetation associations; later adaptations relied on environmental surrogates for full GB classification.
- Field survey components evolved over time (vegetation quadrats, soils, habitat mapping, land cover) and fed into national estimates of habitat areas.

## Evolution of the Land Classification and Sampling Framework

- 1978 (Initial Survey)
  - ISA-based land classification produced 32 classes from environmental data across a central set of 1,228 squares.
  - 8 squares per class surveyed (256 total); eight samples per class formed the basis for national habitat area estimates.
  - Outputs used to estimate national habitat areas as mean habitat per square times land-class area.

- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Expanded sampling to 12 squares per land class (384 total), still using the 32-class framework from 1990 data.
  - Focus shifted toward land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; urban and sea corrections added.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of earlier vegetation quadrats and expanded feature recording.
  - Publication of Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; Fourth Field Survey)
  - Classification extended to enable Scotland-only reporting; land classes increased to 40.
  - 569 squares surveyed; national estimates aligned with revised classification.
  - Outputs focused on separate reporting units for Scotland and broader UK results.

- 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000)
  - Further refinement to enable separate country estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland), driven by policy needs.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating more strata, about 40 total, then expanded to 40+).
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of the new classes; targeted upland habitat sampling introduced (uplands module).

## Country-specific Estimation and Upland Module (CS2000)

- Separate country estimates were implemented for England with Wales and Scotland, with adjustments to classification and sampling to maintain representation within each country.
- Class sub-divisions and aggregations created 40 strata; additional squares ensured minimum representation across new classes.
- Wales saw targeted expansion:
  - Welsh-only reporting necessitated new Welsh sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increased Welsh sample squares to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - Isle of Man samples removed from country estimates and replaced with additional England squares.
- An uplands module added 30 extra squares in upland and marginal upland areas of England and Wales to improve accuracy for upland habitat estimates.

## Sampling Framework and Outputs in CS2007

- 2007 Adjustments for Wales-only reporting
  - Five Welsh sub-classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45 (from 40).
  - Wales gained 43 additional squares to ensure representation across new classes; minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - England saw no compensatory increase; two English classes (5e, 15e) retained only 4 squares per class, deemed acceptable for reporting purposes.
- The revised land-class maps for England with Wales and Scotland are provided to reflect country-specific sampling frameworks.
- Summary data presented in CS2007 tables show the distribution of survey squares by class and country, with total survey squares across GB and per-country breakdowns.

## Outputs, Estimation Approach, and Data Considerations

- National estimates are calculated as:
  - For each land class: mean habitat area per square in the class × total area of that class.
  - Aggregated across classes to yield country and GB estimates.
- Output formats include habitat area estimates, land-class maps, and tables detailing the number of survey squares and sampling rates by class and country.
- Note on classification changes:
  - Switching land classifications across surveys affects consistency of national estimates.
  - CS1990 vs. CS2000/CS2007 approaches discuss using the latest classification for country estimates to enhance internal consistency, even though comparisons across surveys may be impacted.
- Wales-specific reporting and England’s adjustments reflect policy and devolved governance needs post-1998 and post-devolution.

## Practical Implications for Data Support

- Data management needs to track:
  - Classification version used for each survey and its impact on estimates.
  - Country-unit allocation and sub-division/aggregation of land classes.
  - Addition/removal of survey squares and their distribution across classes and countries.
- Ensuring comparability across years requires clear documentation of:
  - Which Land Classification version is used for estimates.
  - How country-specific sampling is implemented and how new subclasses are represented.
- Outputs require careful linkage between raw survey data, land-class maps, and estimation formulas to reproduce national and country-level Habitat estimates.
