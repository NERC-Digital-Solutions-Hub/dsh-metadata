# A1.1.1. Equipment and Soil Core Sampling Procedures

## Purpose and scope
- Field collection of soil cores across 120 squares, with five soil sampling locations per square (four individual cores plus one composite sample) to support soil analysis and GIS-based mapping.

## Equipment
- Electric Cold Box (kept cool by charging from vehicle lighter socket)
- Electrical mains charger for accommodation
- 2 knives; 2 plastic plates; Hammer; 2 pairs of pliers; Mallet
- Regular trowel; Long thin trowel; Notebook & pen
- Parcel tape; Spare cores
- Pack for X-plots including:
  - X-plot cores, end caps, labelled bags
  - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

## Core sampling procedure and core types
- Core C: BLACK, 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter
  - Locate 15 cm south of the corner of the centre quadrat (useful tip: black core length is 15 cm)
  - Place into plastic bag and seal
- Core F: SHORT WHITE, 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - 15 cm to the east of the black core
  - Leave litter layer intact
  - Cap ends after sampling; seal in bag
- Core N: LONG WHITE, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner of the centre quadrat)
  - Cap ends; seal in bag
- Core P: LONG GREY, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - 15 cm west of the black core
  - Ensure correct orientation with bevelled end on soil surface
  - Cap ends; seal in bag

## Sampling locations per square
- Five sampling locations per square:
  - Four individual cores (C, F, N, P)
  - One composite soil sample collected across the 5 m quadrat boundary

## Composite soil sample collection
- Composite sample fills the plastic bag up to the top of the top white panel
- 8–10 sub-samples collected with the long thin trowel to a depth of 15 cm
- Sub-samples taken along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, evenly distributed
- If issues (unusual vegetation, cow pats, boulders), move sampling point and record problem
- Bag the composite sample in a sealable bag (and then in a second bag if required)

## Sample storage and dispatch
- After collecting all cores for a square, store as follows:
  - Core C (BLACK): place in its own bag; once all black cores for the square are collected, store together in a spare plastic bag; keep in a cardboard box in the vehicle, cooled and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): bag with other short white cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples are collected, place in mailbag for CEH Lancaster and post promptly
  - Core P (GREY): bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples are collected, place in mailbag for CEH Lancaster and post promptly
  - Core N (WHITE): bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples are collected, place in mailbag for CEH Bangor and post promptly
  - Soil Sample Bag (composite): place in the cool box immediately; then in mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster and post promptly
- Posting schedule and guidance:
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If last post on Thursday is required, place samples in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post on Fridays
  - If nearest post boxes cannot take the packages, use a convenient Post Office
  - Check OS map data or Road Atlas to locate Post Offices

## GIS and data considerations
- Capture precise spatial identifiers for each sample:
  - Square and quadrat references, core type, and sampling location
  - Depth and orientation information (especially for Core P)
  - Any deviations or problem notes (to be documented in accompanying envelope)
- Ensure consistent labeling and packaging to maintain traceability of samples across locations
- Data quality: verify correct core assignment to each location and follow-up on any sampling issues to maintain dataset integrity for map-based visualization and analysis
