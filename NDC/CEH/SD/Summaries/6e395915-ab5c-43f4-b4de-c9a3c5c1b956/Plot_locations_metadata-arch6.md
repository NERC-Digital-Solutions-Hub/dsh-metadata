# Plot_locations_metadata.rtf

- Purpose: Metadata for Plot_locations.csv, which holds the locations of sampling sites.
- Experimental design: three 75 m transects, 20 m apart across a hillslope perpendicular to the river Hiraethlyn; along each transect, four boreholes drilled to bedrock; some locations have a second borehole labeled 'new' (not different from 'old').
- Collection methods: coordinates collected with a handheld Garmin GPS device.
- Nature and units of recorded values:
  - Latitude and Longitude captured in degrees, minutes, seconds and converted to decimal degrees.
  - Coordinates also provided as six-figure Ordnance Survey National Grid references.
- Data structure: Plot_locations.csv consists of 8 columns:
  - Name: site identifier
  - Latitude: decimal degrees
  - Longitude: decimal degrees
  - Date: date of measurement
  - Time: time of measurement (GMT)
  - Easting: British National Grid Easting
  - Northing: British National Grid Northing
  - ODN: elevation in metres above Ordnance Datum Newlyn
- Projection guidance:
  - Longitude/Latitude should be displayed using GCS_WGS_1984 (WKID: 4326, EPSG).
  - Easting/Northing should be displayed using OSGB1936 British National Grid (WKID: 27700, EPSG).
- Visualization note: An image (courtesy Welsh Government) illustrates correct site locations.
- Data quality and reuse considerations:
  - Ensure the base map and coordinates use the correct projection to display sites accurately.
  - The dataset supports cross-referencing site identifiers with coordinates, dates, times, and elevations for analysis and self-service exploration.
