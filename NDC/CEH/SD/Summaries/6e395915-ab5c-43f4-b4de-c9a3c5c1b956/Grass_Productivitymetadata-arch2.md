## Study and sampling design
- Experimental unit: 1 x 1 square metre quadrats.
- Nine quadrats were sampled; within each quadrat, five 10 x 10 x 10 cm swards were extracted, one per treatment (Control, Water, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Nitrogen+Phosphorus), yielding 45 swards in total.
- Treatments (n = 9 replicates per treatment across quadrats): 
  - Control (initial biomass cut)
  - Water (de-ionised water)
  - Nitrogen (150 kg N/ha)
  - Phosphorus (30 kg P/ha)
  - Nitrogen + Phosphorus (150 kg N/ha + 30 kg P/ha)

## Application details
- Nutrient solutions: 
  - Nitrogen source: ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3)
  - Phosphorus source: sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4)
- Application volume: 20 millilitres per sward.
- Application dates: first on 18/08/2016; second on 24/09/2016.
- Sampling schedule: First_cut biomass measured on 23/09/2016; Second_cut biomass measured on 23/10/2016.

## Collection and processing methods
- Harvest: swards cut to 1 cm height, collected in pre-weighed bags.
- Fresh weight: recorded in the field.
- Drying: samples oven-dried at 80°C for 24 hours, then reweighed to determine dry weight.
- Field conditions prior to weighing: swards were soaked to field capacity and kept in a glasshouse at 16°C day / 10°C night.
- Instrumentation: balances (calibrated monthly by lab technicians); oven for drying.

## Data and units
- Primary output: grams of dry weight per 100 cm2 (g/100 cm2).
- Recorded fields per data row:
  - Transect – Number of transect
  - Row – Number of row
  - Treatment – Water, N, P, N+P, or Control (initial biomass cut)
  - First_cut – biomass in g/100 cm2 on 23/09/2016
  - Second_cut – biomass in g/100 cm2 on 23/10/2016

## Data quality and provenance
- Data provenance notes:
  - Location references: see Plot_locations.csv for row and transect locations; Plot_locations_metadata.rtf describes Plot_locations.csv
  - Precise locations identified by Cage coordinates
- Calibration and quality control:
  - Balances calibrated monthly by laboratory technicians
  - No additional quality control steps documented (Quality Control: NA)

## Additional context for analysis
- Data structure supports comparing the effects of nutrient amendments (N, P, N+P) and water on grass productivity over two harvest periods, relative to an initial biomass control.
- Designed to support standardized, location-based environmental monitoring with replicates across nine quadrats, enabling temporal assessment of treatment effects.
