# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- Coordinated and funded by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Relies on volunteers for data contribution.
- Provides annual data on butterfly population status from a wide-scale, site-based monitoring program.
- Sampling framework includes standard transects, wider countryside surveys, and targeted single-species surveys.
- Monitors butterfly populations across the UK since 1976, with over 3,000 actively recorded sites per year.

## Data collection methods
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) from April to September; ~5 m recording band.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (min 2 in July/August); ~800 squares per year.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species.

## Nature of data and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative, not absolute) derived from counts across sites.
- Site indices represent a constant proportion of true population; detectability varies by species.
- Collated indices created with Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) methodology (2016) and weighted by the proportion of the flight period surveyed per site/year.
- All counts from Pollard walks, WCBS, and other surveys inform seasonal patterns and gaps are extrapolated; observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

## Quality control
- Field data entered on standard forms, uploaded to UKBMS database; online checks and the Transect Walker tool flag potential errors.
- Regional transect coordinators review records; continuous validation throughout the season.
- Additional automated/manual validation checks for out-of-range distributions, atypical flight periods, new site records, extreme values.
- Corrections made via queries and discussions with coordinators/recorders as needed.

## Data download details
- Annual collated indices of abundance for species with sufficient data from 1976–2023 (earlier years may lack indices for some species).
- Data provided as a CSV file with columns:
  - SPECIES_CODE, SPECIES, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, N_SITES, COLLATED_INDEX (log10, scaled so average = 2), YEAR_RANK, TIME_PERIOD, COUNTRY.
- Includes taxonomic references for species check.

## Licence and attribution
- Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use and reuse.
- Must cite the dataset with the specified DOI in any reporting; include the attribution: Contains UKButterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.

## Collaboration and contact details
- UKBMS Partners offer guidance on dataset use and interpretation; open to collaboration and co-authorship on publications.
