# Tarland Burn Water Chemistry and Discharge Dataset (2000-2010)

## Aim and Context
- Part of a long-running Scottish Government funded catchment study (~15 years) in the Tarland catchment, the uppermost tributary of the River Dee (NE Scotland), examining diffuse pollution, river morphology changes, habitat and biodiversity, and flood mitigation.
- Focuses on using routine monitoring and experimental study data to assess water quality, habitat, biodiversity, and pollutant impacts over time.

## Data Coverage
- Mean daily flow (m3/s) and water chemistry data for Tarland Burn, 2000–2010.
- Measured water chemistry determinands (units mg/l): Total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), Total phosphorus (TP), Particulate phosphorus (PP), Nitrate-N (NO3-N), Ammonium (NH4-N), Suspended sediments (SS).
- Derived nutrients: Dissolved organic N (DON) = TDN − (NO3-N + NH4-N); Dissolved organic P (DOP) = TDP − MRP; Particulate N (PN) = TN − TDN; Particulate P (PP) = digest-derived PP.

## Sampling and Sampling Schedule
- Location: Coull site, Tarland Burn near catchment outlet.
- 2000–2003: Grab samples weekly; some daily sampling during rainfall events.
- February–March 2004: Daily samples via autosampler (ISCO 3700).
- April 2004–May 2005: Daily sampling with autosampler; increased frequency to every 4 hours during storm events.
- After June 2005: Sampling reduced to more infrequent and irregular intervals.

## Sample Collection and Handling
- Auto-sampler placed in a wooden shed under tree shade; not refrigerated.
- Samples transported in cool boxes to the laboratory; collected on 5–14 day intervals initially, with 4-hour storm-event intensification during autosampling periods.

## Analytical Methods
- Filtration: Unfiltered samples split; 0.45 µm filters used for filtrates.
- Suspended solids (SS): Gravimetric measurement on air-dried filters.
- Nutrients (filtrate): Colorimetric analysis (NO3-N, NH4-N, Molybdate Reactive P) using San++ analyzer within 24 hours.
- Digestion: Automated persulphate/UV digestion for TDN, TDP, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC); unfiltered samples digested manually (persulphate autoclave) to yield NO-N and MRP.
- Calculations: DON and DOP derived from digested vs. filtered results; PN and PP derived from total and dissolved pools.

## Discharge Data and Processing
- Discharge calibration: Burn stage height calibrated against discharge using velocity-area profiling across the channel at 60% depth.
- Velocity measurements: Conducted with a propeller device (Valeport).
- Stage height logging: 1-minute resolution; 15-minute summary data.
- Daily flow: Calculated with a day defined as 9:00 a.m. to 8:45 a.m., aligned to Met Office rainfall data.

## Data Management and Outputs
- Data collected and analyzed using standardized procedures; outputs typically presented in clear formats such as reports, tables, and figures, suitable for monitoring environmental health and policy performance.
- While not explicitly stated for storage in this dataset, the protocol emphasizes verification, quality assurance, and preparation of data for sharing and portal upload as part of ongoing monitoring responsibilities.
