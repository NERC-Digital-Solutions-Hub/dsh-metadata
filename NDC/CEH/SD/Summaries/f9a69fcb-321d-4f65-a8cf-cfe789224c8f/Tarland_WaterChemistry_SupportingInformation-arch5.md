# Tarland catchment water quality and discharge dataset (2000-2010)

## Overview
- The Tarland catchment is part of a long-running Scottish Government funded program (about 15 years), making it one of the UK’s most extensive catchment case studies.
- It is the uppermost tributary of the River Dee (NE Scotland) and experiences pressures from diffuse pollution, altered river morphology, and a rural community with many private septic tanks.
- Regular routine spatial monitoring combined with experimental studies investigates water quality, habitat and biodiversity, diffuse pollution impacts, and flood mitigation.

## Data scope
- Dataset covers mean daily flow (m3/s) and water chemistry data for the Tarland Burn, collected 2000–2010.
- Measured water chemistry determinands and units:
  - Total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) — mg/L
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) — mg/L
  - Total phosphorus (TP) — mg/L
  - Particulate phosphorus (PP) — mg/L
  - Nitrate (NO3-N) — mg/L
  - Ammonium (NH4-N) — mg/L
  - Suspended sediments (SS) — mg/L
- Sampling location: Coull, near the catchment outlet (WGS84 57.111, -2.810; OSGB 351050, 802540).

## Sampling methodology
- Water sample collection:
  - Weekly grab samples from 2000–2003.
  - February–March 2004: daily samples using autosampler (ISCO 3700).
  - April 2004–May 2005: daily sampling with autosampler, increased to 4-hourly during storm events.
  - Post-June 2005: more infrequent, irregular sampling.
  - Autosampler housed in a wooden shed, not refrigerated; samples collected 5–14 day intervals and transported immediately to the laboratory in cool boxes.
- Sample handling note: after collection, samples were analyzed following specified laboratory workflows (see “Laboratory analysis”).

## Laboratory analysis
- Filtration and SS: Subsamples filtered through pre-weighed Whatman 0.45 µm cellulose acetate filters; SS determined gravimetrically from the filters.
- Colorimetric analyses: Filtrates analysed for NO3-N, NH4-N, and molybdate reactive P (MRP) within 24 hours.
- Digestion and further analyses:
  - Unfiltered samples digested by persulphate autoclave to digest N and P forms, followed by NO-N and MRP analyses within ~4 weeks.
  - Automated persulphate/UV digestion procedures for total dissolved N (TDN), total dissolved P (TDP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
- Derived parameters:
  - Dissolved organic N (DON) = TDN − (NO3-N + NH4-N)
  - Dissolved organic P (DOP) = TDP − MRP
  - Particulate N (PN) and Particulate P (PP) calculated from unfiltered sample digestion values (e.g., PN = TN − TDN). PN and PP are based on digestion-derived values from the unfiltered sample; PP calculations are implied by particulate fractions.

## Discharge data
- Discharge calibration:
  - Burn stage height calibrated against discharge using velocity-area profiling across the channel at 60% depth.
  - Velocities measured with a propeller (Valeport).
- Data logging:
  - Stage heights logged at 1-minute intervals; mean daily flow derived from these data.
  - A day is defined as 9:00 AM to 8:45 AM to align with Met Office rainfall data.

## Context and aims of the dataset
- The dataset supports long-term assessment of diffuse pollution, river morphology changes, habitat and biodiversity, and flood mitigation strategies within the Tarland catchment.
- Emphasizes linking land management practices to water quality outcomes and understanding seasonal to event-driven nutrient and sediment dynamics.
