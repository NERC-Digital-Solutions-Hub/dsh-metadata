# Tarland Burn water chemistry and discharge data (2000-2010)

## Aim and context
- Part of a Scottish Government funded research program spanning ~15 years, making Tarland catchment one of the UK’s longest-running comprehensive catchment case studies.
- Focused on investigating water quality, habitat and biodiversity, diffuse pollution impacts, and flood mitigation in the Tarland Burn, the upper tributary of the River Dee in NE Scotland.

## Data coverage
- Mean daily flow (m3/s) and water chemistry data for Tarland Burn, collected between 2000 and 2010.
- Determinands measured (units are mg/L): Total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), Total phosphorus (TP), Particulate phosphorus (PP), Nitrate (NO3-N), Ammonium (NH4-N), Suspended solids (SS).
- Sampling site: Coull, near the catchment outlet (WGS84 57.111, -2.810; OSGB 351050, 802540).

## Sampling design and schedule
- 2000–2003: Weekly grab samples, with some daily sampling during rainfall events.
- February–March 2004: Daily samples collected using an autosampler (ISCO 3700) housed in a shed; not refrigerated.
- April 2004–May 2005: Autosampler set to daily sampling, with increased frequency (every 4 hours) during storm events.
- After June 2005: Sampling became more infrequent and irregular.

## Sample handling and laboratory analysis
- Filtration: Aliquots filtered through pre-weighed Whatman 0.45 µm filters; SS determined gravimetrically from air-dried filters.
- Analysis of filtrates: Colorimetric determination of NO3-N, NH4-N, and MRP (molybdate reactive phosphorus) using a San++ analyzer.
- Dissolved and total measurements: TDN, TDP, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analyzed after automated persulphate/UV digestion.
- Unfiltered samples: Manually digested (persulphate autoclave) to digest all N and P forms, then analyzed for NO-N and MRP.
- Calculations:
  - Dissolved organic N (DON) = TDN − (NO3-N + NH4-N)
  - Dissolved organic P (DOP) = TDP − MRP
  - Particulate N (PN) = TN − TDN
  - Particulate P (PP) = TP − TDP (PN and PP taken from the digest value of the unfiltered sample)

## Discharge data and data processing
- Stage height calibrated against discharge using velocity-area profiling across the channel at 60% depth.
- Velocities measured with a propeller device (Valeport).
- Stage heights logged as 1-minute means; daily flow calculated with a day defined as 9:00–08:45 local time to align with Met Office rainfall data.

## Site metadata
- Sampling location: Coull, near Tarland Burn outlet.
- Geographic coordinates: WGS84 57.111, -2.810; OSGB 351050, 802540.
- Context: Part of a long-term program addressing diffuse pollution, hydrology–chemistry linkage, and flood mitigation within the Tarland catchment.

## Data quality and limitations
- Autosampler not refrigerated in the early phases; potential sample preservation concerns.
- Sampling frequency varied over time, with irregular efforts after mid-2000s, introducing gaps and potential bias in trend analyses.
- Detailed methodology and standard procedures reported, supporting quality and comparability, but some metadata gaps (e.g., full QA/QC procedures beyond described methods) are not specified.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates integration of hydrological and chemical monitoring over a long time span to inform environmental health assessments.
- Provides a comprehensive dataset framework including site-specific metadata, standardized laboratory methods, and transparent calculations for dissolved and particulate nutrient fractions.
- Highlights common monitoring challenges faced by practitioners: data gaps, variable sampling intensity, data governance considerations, and the need for clear metadata to enable reuse and verification.
