# Element and radionuclide concentrations in wildlife (including representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants) and associated soils from forests in north-east England, 2015-2016

## Overview
- Dataset of stable element concentrations, radionuclide activity (K-40, Cs-137), and concentration ratios (CRs) across a wide range of flora and fauna and soils.
- Targets representative terrestrial species of the ICRP RAPs to support environmental protection framework development.
- Data cover soil, water, vegetation, fungi, invertebrates, small mammals, and amphibians collected between March 2015 and October 2016.

## Study sites and sampling design
- Sampling locations: Holystone Woods (NGR 3940 6030) and Kielder Forest (NGR 3760 6010); additional material from Spadeadam Forest (north-east Cumbria).
- Main study areas: Holystone (~0.06 km2) and Redesdale/Kielder (~0.16 km2), with diverse soil types and forest structure (coniferous, peat soils, purple moor grass, heather).
- Sampling dates span 2015–2016; GPS locations recorded with ~5 m accuracy.
- Species and sample types include soil, water, wild grasses, trees, herbaceous plants, shrubs, fungal fruiting bodies, earthworms, bees, wood mice, bank voles, roe deer, common frogs, frogspawn, European toads, and roe deer tissues.

## Data collected and structure
- Data components across 42 workbooks:
  - Sample information workbooks (n=4): species, sampling site/location, unique codes, mass metrics (FM/DM/AM), dimensions, and preparation/analysis notes.
  - Stable element concentration (FM) workbooks (n=15): concentrations and LODs in fresh mass for vegetation and tissues of roe deer, common frogs (and frogspawn), and wood mice; water concentrations; whole-organism FM concentrations for several taxa; notes.
  - Stable element concentration (DM) workbooks (n=9): concentrations in dry mass for soil, vegetation, and tissues; ash mass for some samples; whole-organism DM for some taxa.
  - Radionuclide data workbooks (n=6): activity concentrations for K-40 and Cs-137 (FM/DM or both) with two-sigma errors and MDAs; Cs-137 concentration ratios.
  - Stable element concentration ratios (whole-organism FM) workbooks (n=8): CRs for bees, roe deer, earthworms, common frogs, European toads, bank voles, wood mice, grasses and trees.
- Focused measurements:
  - Radionuclides: K-40 and Cs-137 activities; elemental CRs relative to soil or water; Cs-137 tissue-based CRs where applicable.
  - Elements: broad suite analyzed via ICP-MS; additional iodine data using specialized digestion/extraction.
- Tissue and organism representations:
  - Roe deer, wood mice, bank voles, common frogs, European toads, bees, earthworms, grasses, pines, and other vegetation.
  - Whole-organism estimations for certain species based on measured tissues (bone, muscle, liver, thyroid etc.) and established mass fractions.

## Laboratory methods and quality assurance
- Stable elements:
  - ICP-MS analysis with multiple modes (collision-cell He, STD, H2-cell); internal standards (Ge, Rh, Ir); external multi-element calibration.
  - Digestions: acid digests (HNO3/HF/HClO4) and alkaline extractions (TMAH) with QA via SRMs (NIST) and blanks.
- Iodine analyses:
  - Alkaline (TMAH) and acidic digestions; specific iodine calibration and internal standards; caveats about dissolution efficiency, especially for pine heartwood cores.
- Gamma analyses:
  - K-40 and Cs-137 activity measured using hyper-pure Ge detectors; MDA-based reporting; decay-corrected to sampling day; QA with replicate analyses and proficiency testing.
- Samples processed at UKCEH and University of Nottingham; use of standard reference materials and documented digestion/extraction procedures.
- Data quality:
  - Detection limits reported as 3× standard deviation of blanks; some samples reported as <LOD.
  - Quality control includes replicated analyses, blanks, proficiency schemes, and use of SRMs.

## Calculations and data interpretation
- Whole-organism concentrations:
  - Roe deer: composed of estimated bone, muscle, liver, and thyroid (and gonads for frogs) masses; whole-body concentrations derived from measured tissues and established mass fractions.
  - Wood mice: whole-organism estimates based on bone, muscle, liver, and thyroid (iodine) when available.
  - Frogs and toads: tissue-based estimates (bone, muscle, liver, gonads, kidney/spleen/lung) with gut and thyroid data where possible; muscle and gonads used for frogs in some cases.
  - Bank voles: whole-organism concentrations from bone and muscle estimates plus liver and other tissues where available.
  - Bees and earthworms: whole-organism analyses conducted directly.
- Concentration ratios (CR):
  - CR wo-soil: whole-organism concentration (FM) divided by soil concentration (DM or FM depending on dataset) for each species/tissue.
  - CRs to water for frogspawn; CRs to other matrices as appropriate.
- Data completeness:
  - If a tissue element was not detectable in all tissues, LODs used; if a 10%+ contribution came from sub-LOD tissues, a published approach for reporting a “less than” value was used.
- Data accessibility:
  - Data organized in 42 workbooks with detailed metadata enabling cross-linking of species, site, tissues, and analytical results.

## Data use, context, and intentions
- Supports ICRP RAPs and broader environmental protection modeling by providing transfer parameters and site-specific data for forest ecosystems.
- Enables assessment of element and radionuclide transfer through terrestrial food webs and habitat matrices.
- Facilitates future meta-analyses and parameterization of environmental risk assessment tools.
