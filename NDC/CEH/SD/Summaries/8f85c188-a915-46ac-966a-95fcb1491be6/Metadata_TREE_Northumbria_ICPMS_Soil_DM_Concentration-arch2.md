# TREE_Northumbria_ICPMS_Soil_DM

## Overview
- Data dictionary for a soil ICP-MS dataset, associated with UKCEH/Northumbria sampling.
- Captures sample identifiers, site, sampling date, and concentrations of multiple elements.
- All concentration measurements are in milligrams per kilogram dry mass (mg/kg DM).

## Data quality, standards, and provenance
- Data should be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed prior to use.
- Prepared for presentation in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and for storage/upload to appropriate portals.
- Dataset aligns with standard environmental monitoring practices to enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Reusability and access
- Designed to enable reuse by others, with standardized field names and explanations.
- Facilitates integration with other datasets for enhanced value (e.g., combining with related environmental data).

## Notes and caveats
- Some field explanations contain inconsistencies (e.g., repetitive or incorrect descriptions associated with certain elements). Users should verify and correct metadata during data QA prior to analysis.
- While the structure supports broad, standardised analyses, careful data cleaning is advised to ensure accurate element labeling and unit consistency across the dataset.
