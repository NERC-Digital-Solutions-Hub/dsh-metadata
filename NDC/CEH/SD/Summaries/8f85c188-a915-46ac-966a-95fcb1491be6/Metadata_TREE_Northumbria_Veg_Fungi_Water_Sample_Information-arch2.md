# TREE_Northumbria_Veg_Fungi_Water_Sample_Information

## Purpose
- Defines the data schema for recording sample information related to vegetation, fungi, and water in the Northumbria TREE monitoring context.
- Captures taxonomic identifiers, sampling details, and analytical metadata to support environmental health assessments over time.

## Data Fields and Descriptions
- Latin_Species_Name: Latin taxonomic name of the species.
- Common_Species_Name: Common name of the species.
- Site: Sampling site.
- Date_Sample_Collected: Date the sample was collected.
- Sampling_Location_Or_National_Grid_Reference: Sampling location or National Grid Reference (NGR).
- CEH_Sample_Code: CEH (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) sample code associated with the sample.
- CEH_Sample_Description: Description of the CEH sample.
- Sample_Fresh_Mass_kg: Fresh mass of the sample (in kilograms).
- Sample_Dried_Mass_kg: Dry mass of the sample (in kilograms); not applicable for water samples.
- General_Notes: General notes related to the sample.
- Sample_Preparation_And_Analysis_Performed: Details of sample preparation and analyses conducted.

## Units and Reference Information
- Mass fields: Sample_Fresh_Mass_kg and Sample_Dried_Mass_kg use kilograms (kg).
- NGR: Stands for National Grid Reference.

## Data Handling and Quality
- Data should be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed from established sources.
- Analyses should follow standardized methods to produce outputs (e.g., categorizing environmental health against standards).
- Datasets should be stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to ensure traceability and accessibility.

## Practical Implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Enables consistent cross-site and temporal comparisons of vegetation, fungi, and water samples.
- Supports linking biological observations with sampling metadata for robust environmental health assessments.
- Facilitates data sharing and access to underlying data, aligning with the goal of increasing dataset value and transparency.
