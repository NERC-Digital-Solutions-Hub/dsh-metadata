# Element and radionuclide concentrations in wildlife (including representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants) and associated soils from forests in north-east England, 2015-2016

## Aim and policy relevance
- Provides environmental health measures by reporting stable element and radionuclide concentrations across a range of biological and environmental matrices.
- Targets RAPs (ICRP) to contribute to environmental protection frameworks and support development of monitoring parameters for policy evaluation and decision-making.

## Study design and sampling sites
- Two forests in north-east England: Holystone Woods and Kielder/ Redesdale (with Spadeadam area), sampled 2015–2016.
- Main sampling areas defined (Holystone ~0.06 km2; Redesdale ~0.16 km2) with some additional samples from Spadeadam.
- GPS locations recorded; sampling included a variety of habitats within and around forest stands.

## Sample types and collection
- Soils, waters, vegetation (grasses, trees, herbaceous plants, shrubs), fungi, earthworms, bees, small mammals (wood mice, bank voles), amphibians (common frogs, frogspawn, European toads), and large mammals (roe deer).
- For each taxon, detailed metadata collected (sampling site, NGR, sample mass, dimensions where recorded; sometimes additional notes).
- Tissue types and whole-organism approaches defined for calculating concentrations.

## Analytical methods and processing
- Stable elements: ICP-MS analysis following acid digestion; multiple instrumental modes (He-cell, STD, H2-cell) with internal standards; alkaline (TMAH) extractions to determine iodine where applicable.
- Radionuclides: gamma analysis for K-40 and Cs-137 using high-purity germanium detectors; counting-error estimates and minimum detectable activity (MDA) reported.
- Specific digestion protocols:
  - Soil: acid digestion with HNO3, HF, HClO4; TMAH extraction for comparison.
  - Vegetation and plant tissues: acid digestion (HNO3) and sometimes microwave-assisted TMAH digestion; internal reference materials used for QA.
  - Animal tissues: microwave-assisted acid digestion with HNO3 and H2O2; TMAH extraction for certain tissues; ashing for some samples.
  - Water: filtration and acidification prior to ICP-MS/OES analyses.
- Quality assurance: use of SRMs (e.g., NIST references) to verify digestion and analysis; participation in proficiency testing; blanks and replicate analyses included.

## Calculation methods: whole-organism concentrations and concentration ratios
- Whole-organism concentrations estimated for roe deer, small mammals, and amphibians by aggregating tissue concentrations and tissue masses (bone, muscle, liver, kidney, thyroid, gonads where relevant).
- For Cs-137, muscle concentrations used as proxies for whole-organism values in some cases, following established conventions.
- Concentration Ratios (CR) calculated as whole-organism concentration relative to soil or water concentrations; CRs reported based on FM, DM, or AM as appropriate for each organism and tissue type.
- For some taxa and tissues, if data were below detection in contributing tissues, LOD-based or “less than” values applied; CRs summarized accordingly.

## Data products and structure
- Dataset compiled into 42 workbooks, organized as:
  - Sample information workbooks (n=4): species, sample descriptions, site, locations, masses, dimensions, metadata, pH/LOI/depth, etc.
  - Stable element concentration (FM) workbooks (n=15): concentrations and LODs in mg/kg FM for vegetation and animal tissues; whole-organism concentrations in mg/kg FM for certain species; water concentrations in mg/L.
  - Stable element concentration (DM) workbooks (n=9): concentrations in mg/kg DM for soil, vegetation, and animal tissues; some whole-organism concentrations in mg/kg DM/AM for certain species.
  - Radionuclide data workbooks (n=6): activity concentrations for K-40 and Cs-137; CRs based on FM/DM/AM where applicable.
  - Stable element Concentration Ratios (whole-organism FM) workbooks (n=8): CRs by taxon (bees, roe deer, earthworms, common frogs, European toads, bank voles, wood mice, and plants/tungi like pines and grasses).
- Data coverage includes soil, water, plants, fungi, invertebrates, amphibians, small mammals, deer, and bees, with tissue- and whole-organism-level concentrations and CRs.

## Data quality, standards, and governance
- Rigorous QA through SRMs, method validation, and inter-laboratory proficiency participation.
- Detailed documentation of sample preparation, digestion methods, and analysis parameters to support reproducibility.
- Clear reporting of detection limits (LOD) and handling of non-detects; explicit notes on samples with partial data.
- Data are structured to enable transparent traceability from site sampling through tissue selection to final concentration values and CRs.
- Data sharing and openness are embedded in the dataset design, with comprehensive metadata and standardized reporting to facilitate reuse in monitoring frameworks.

## Data access, usability, and governance implications for monitoring frameworks
- Comprehensive, multi-taxa, multi-matrix dataset aligned with ICRP RAP concepts, suitable for informing environmental protection policies and model parameterization (e.g., transfer to RAPs and CR development).
- The dataset demonstrates the importance of harmonized metadata, standardized sample descriptions, and clear tissue-level attribution to enable cross-study comparisons and meta-analyses.
- Highlights challenges relevant to monitoring frameworks: data gaps across taxa or tissues, need for consistent data governance, access to large multi-source datasets, and the balance between public data sharing and data sensitivity or quality control.
- The framework used here (selection of RAP species, tissue pooling, and whole-organism estimation procedures) provides a model for integrating complex field data into policy-relevant indicators and decision-support tools.
