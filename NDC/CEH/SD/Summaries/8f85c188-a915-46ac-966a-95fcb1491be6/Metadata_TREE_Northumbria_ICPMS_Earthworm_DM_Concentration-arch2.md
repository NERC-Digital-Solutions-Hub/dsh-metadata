# TREE_Northumbria_ICPMS_Earthworm_DM_Concentration

## Overview
- Dataset measuring element concentrations in earthworms from Northumbria using ICP-MS.
- Concentrations are reported on a dry mass basis (mg/kg DM).
- Includes species information, sampling metadata, and sample identifiers.

## Data content and structure
- Taxonomic and sample metadata:
  - Latin_Species_Name
  - Common_Species_Name
  - Site
  - Date_Sample_Collected
  - CEH_Sample_Codes
  - CEH_Sample_Description
  - Notes
- Measured elements (concentration variables, all in mg/kg DM):
  - I, Li, Be, Na, Mg, Al, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Cs, Ba, Tl, Pb, U
- For each element: explanatory text and units are provided within the dataset description.

## Purpose and use
- Supports environmental health assessments by providing standardized, comparable concentrations of multiple elements in a terrestrial bioindicator (earthworms).
- Enables monitoring over time and across sites to evaluate pollution and ecological impact.
- Aligns with standardised data practices: data verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and clear presentation.

## Data quality, standards, and processing
- Data are described with explicit metadata fields (species, site, sampling codes, notes) to support reproducibility.
- Intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
- Typical processing goals include verifying data integrity, applying standardised analysis methods, and producing clear outputs (reports, maps, charts).

## How this fits the Analyst Monitoring the Environment archetype
- Provides a consistently formatted dataset suitable for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Reflects standardised approaches, explicit data provenance, and readiness for quality assurance and archiving.
- Supports enabling access to underlying data and integrating with other monitoring datasets for broader assessments.

## Challenges and considerations
- Large, multi-element dataset requires careful QA to ensure comparability across elements and samples.
- Integration with other data sources (e.g., site characteristics, additional bioindicators) to maximise dataset value.
