# TREE_Northumbria_ICPMS_Toad_FM_Concentration

## Overview
- Dataset documenting concentrations of multiple elements in toad tissue, reported as mg/kg fresh mass (FM).
- Captures specimen and sampling context alongside a broad suite of elemental measurements to support environmental health assessment and policy monitoring.

## Data contents and structure
- Metadata fields
  - Latin_Species_Name, Common_Species_Name
  - Site, Date_Sample_Collected
  - CEH_Sample_Code, CEH_Sample_Description
  - Fresh_Mass_Ash_Mass_Ratio
  - Notes (toad preparation, with no separate tissues prepared)
- Measurements (all mg/kg FM)
  - I, Li, Be, Na, Mg, Al, P, K, Ca, Ti, V
  - Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Cs, Ba
  - Tl, Pb, U

## Sampling, preparation, and scope
- Sample context includes species identification, sampling site, collection date, and UKCEH sample coding/description.
- Whole-body toad samples used for fresh mass measurements; ash-mass ratio provided.
- Notes indicate preparation details were recorded, with separate-tissue preparations not performed.

## Data quality and presentation
- Data are from established sources; undergo verification, quality assurance, and cleaning.
- Presentations likely in standard formats (reports, maps, charts) and aligned with environmental health indicators.
- Datasets stored in appropriate data portals for accessibility and reuse.

## Intended use and interpretation
- Supports consistent reporting of environmental health indicators over time.
- Enables scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance across sites and dates.
- Facilitates integration with other monitoring data to enhance value beyond single-use datasets.

## Challenges and opportunities
- Increasing dataset value by linking to related environmental data (e.g., co-occurring contaminants, habitat factors).
- Improving access to underlying data to promote transparency and secondary analyses.
