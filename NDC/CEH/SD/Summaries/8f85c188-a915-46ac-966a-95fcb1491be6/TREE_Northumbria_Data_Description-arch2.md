# Element and radionuclide concentrations in wildlife (including representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants) and associated soils from forests in north-east England, 2015-2016

## Aim
- Document stable element concentrations, radionuclide activity (K-40 and Cs-137), and concentration ratios (CRs) in a range of wildlife and soils to support ICRP RAP-based environmental protection frameworks.
- Provide data in a standardized format for scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Store and prepare datasets for upload to appropriate data portals and enable reuse by others.

## Study sites and sampling design
- Sampling locations: Holystone Woods (main area) and Kielder Forest (main area within Redesdale; also Spadeadam Forest) in north-east England.
- Main study areas: Holystone (~0.06 km²) with mixed conifer understory; Redesdale/Kielder forest (~0.16 km²) dominated by Sitka spruce with peat soils; additional sampling in Spadeadam.
- Biological targets aligned with ICRP RAPs; sampling included both main areas and surrounding forest for some species.
- Field sampling period: March 2015 – October 2016.
- Sample types: soil, water, grasses, trees, herbaceous plants, shrubs, fungi, earthworms, bees, wood mice, bank voles, roe deer, common frogs, frogspawn, and European toads.
- Metadata collected: GPS locations (accuracy ~5 m), site descriptions, sample masses, and animal dimensions where recorded.

## What was measured
- Stable elements: concentrations in soil, water, vegetation, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrate tissues (FM, DM, AM as applicable).
- Radionuclides: activity concentrations of K-40 and Cs-137 in applicable media and tissues.
- Concentration ratios (CRs): ratios comparing whole-organism concentrations to soil or water concentrations, on fresh mass (FM) or dry mass (DM) bases as appropriate.
- Whole-organism concentrations: estimated for select mammals and amphibians using tissue-specific measurements (e.g., bone, muscle, liver, kidney, thyroid, gonad) per established approaches.

## Samples and tissues collected
- Soil and water for chemical and radionuclide analyses.
- Vegetation: grasses, trees (pine heartwood cores, branches, needles), herbaceous plants, and shrubs.
- Fungi and fungal fruiting bodies.
- Invertebrates and vertebrates: earthworms, bees (Bombus spp.), wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), bank voles (Myodes glareolus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), common frogs (Rana temporaria) and frogspawn, European toads (Bufo bufo).

## Analytical methods
- Stable element analysis: ICP-MS on digested samples; acid digestion for soils and vegetation; alkaline (TMAH) extractions for selected components; internal standards and external multi-element calibrations; quality control with reference materials and SPC procedures.
- Radionuclide analysis: gamma analysis using hyper-pure germanium detectors for K-40 and Cs-137; decay-corrected activities; detection limits (MDA) applied.
- Sample preparation specifics:
  - Soils: air-dried, LOI, pH; ICP-MS after acid digestion (HNO3, HF, HClO4) with optional TMAH extraction.
  - Vegetation and animal tissues: microwave-assisted acid digestion (HNO3, H2O2) with additional TMAH extraction for certain elements; bone and tissue samples prepared for tissue-specific analysis.
  - Water: filtration, acidification, and ICP-MS/OES analyses.
- Data quality: use of SRM/NIST reference materials; blanks and replicates; proficiency testing participation; reporting of LODs and MDA values.

## Whole-organism concentrations and tissue-based calculations
- For roe deer and small mammals/amphibians, whole-organism concentrations derived from measured tissue concentrations using established mass-fraction contributions (bone, muscle, liver, kidney, thyroid, gonad, etc.).
- Cs-137 treated with muscle as a proxy for whole-organism concentration in some cases, per prior methodology.
- When tissues were not detectable or undissolved residues were present, LODs used; if the estimated contribution from below-LOD tissues was ≥10%, whole-organism value reported as “less than” the LOD.
- For bank voles and common toads, data did not require manipulation for whole-organism calculations in some cases; for others, specific tissue combinations were used.

## Data structure and outputs
- Total of 42 workbooks organized as:
  - Sample information workbooks: species, site, location, sample codes, sex, masses, dimensions, notes, and sample preparation details.
  - Stable element concentration (FM) workbooks: FM concentrations for vegetation and tissues of roe deer, common frogs (and frogspawn), wood mice; water concentrations; whole-organism FM concentrations for several taxa.
  - Stable element concentration (DM) workbooks: DM concentrations for soil and vegetation; tissues of roe deer, common frogs, wood mice; AM concentrations for European toads and bank voles; whole-organism DM for bees and earthworms.
  - Radionuclide data workbooks: Cs-137 and K-40 activity concentrations by media/tissue; MDA notes and concentration ratios (CRs) where applicable.
  - Stable element concentration ratios (FM-based) workbooks: CRs for bees, roe deer, earthworms, common frogs, European toads, bank voles, wood mice, grasses, pines, and herbs/shrubs.
- Data provenance and documentation include site coordinates, sampling depth, sample preparation methods, and assay methods.
- References and methodological context provided to support transfer parameters and environmental monitoring interpretation.

## Use and relevance for environmental monitoring
- Supports the ICRP RAP-based environmental protection framework by providing transfer parameters and site-specific data for forest ecosystems.
- Enables assessment of environmental health and policy performance over time through standardized, QA-checked datasets.
- Data are structured to be integrated with other environmental datasets and to enable cross-site and cross-species comparisons.
- Findings inform modeling of radionuclide and stable element transfer in terrestrial biota, with emphasis on representative RAP species and key exposure pathways.
