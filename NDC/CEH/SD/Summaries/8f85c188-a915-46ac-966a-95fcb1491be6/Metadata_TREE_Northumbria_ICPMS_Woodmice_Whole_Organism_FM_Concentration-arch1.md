# TREE_Northumbria_ICPMS_Woodmice_Whole_Organism_FM_Concentration

## Overview
- Metadata and variable definitions for a dataset of elemental concentrations (ICP-MS) in wood mice, measured as whole-organism, fresh mass (FM), from Northumbria.

## Sample and species metadata
- Latin_Species_Name: Latin name of the species.
- Common_Species_Name: Common name of the species.
- Site: Sampling site.
- Date_Sample_Collected: Date the sample was collected.
- CEH_Sample_Description: UKCEH sample description.
- Notes: Notes relating to tissues used to calculate wood mice whole-organism concentrations.

## Concentration variables (elements)
- The dataset includes concentration columns for a wide range of elements, each reported as mg/kg of whole-organism fresh mass (FM).
  - I_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Iodine)
  - Li_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Lithium)
  - Na_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Sodium)
  - Mg_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Magnesium)
  - Al_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Aluminium)
  - P_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Phosphorus)
  - K_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Potassium)
  - Ca_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Calcium)
  - Ti_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Titanium)
  - V_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Vanadium)
  - Cr_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Chromium)
  - Mn_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Manganese)
  - Fe_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Iron)
  - Co_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Cobalt)
  - Ni_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Nickel) [note: some values may be reported as "<" indicating below reporting limit]
  - Cu_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Copper)
  - Zn_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Zinc)
  - As_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Arsenic)
  - Se_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Selenium)
  - Rb_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Rubidium)
  - Sr_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Strontium)
  - Mo_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Molybdenum)
  - Ag_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Silver) [note: some values may be reported as "<" indicating below reporting limit]
  - Cd_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Cadmium)
  - Cs_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Cesium)
  - Tl_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Thallium)
  - Pb_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Lead)
  - U_mg_kg_whole_organism_FM (Uranium) [note: some values may be reported as "<" indicating below reporting limit]

- Notable data conventions:
  - "<X" markers indicate concentrations below the reporting limit for the corresponding element.
  - All concentration values are expressed in mg/kg on a fresh mass (FM) basis for the whole organism.

## Data structure and notes
- Units for most concentration fields: mg/kg (fresh mass, whole organism).
- Some non-concentration fields list units as n/a or include explanatory notes (e.g., tissue calculation notes).
- The dataset emphasizes whole-organism concentrations rather than tissue-specific measurements.
