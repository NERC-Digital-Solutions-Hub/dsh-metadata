# Element and radionuclide concentrations in wildlife (including representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants) and associated soils from forests in north-east England, 2015-2016

## Overview
- A dataset describing stable element concentrations, radionuclide activity (K-40 and Cs-137), and stable element concentration ratios (CRs) in wildlife, soils, and associated matrices.
- Targets representative terrestrial species per ICRP Reference Animals and Plants (RAPs) to support environmental radiological protection assessments.
- Data collected 2015–2016 from two forests in north-east England to inform environmental transfer parameter development and RAP-based frameworks.

## Study sites and sampling design
- Locations: Holystone Woods and Kielder Forest in north-east England; additional samples from Redesdale and Spadeadam areas near Kielder.
- Main sampling areas:
  - Holystone: about 0.06 km², mixed coniferous plantation with diverse understory.
  - Kielder (Redesdale region): about 0.16 km², Sitka spruce-dominated with peat soils; part of Spadeadam Forest sampled.
- Sampling areas were mapped with GPS (≈5 m accuracy); sampling occurred March 2015–October 2016 (with intensive activities in Aug 2015 for many species).

## Sample types and organisms
- Matrices and species sampled:
  - Soil and water
  - Vegetation: grasses, trees, herbaceous plants, shrubs
  - Fungi and fungal fruiting bodies
  - Invertebrates and vertebrates: earthworms, bees, wood mice, bank voles, roe deer
  - Amphibians: common frogs, frogspawn, European toads
  - Roe deer and other small mammals to support whole-organism transfer assessments
- Tissue and sample details:
  - For mammals and amphibians: tissues such as liver, kidney, thyroid-containing tissue, gonads, muscle, bone; whole-organism concentrates estimated from measured tissues
  - For plants and fungi: multiple components (e.g., pine needles, branches, heartwood cores, various herbaceous species)
  - For invertebrates and other animals: body masses, dissections, and selected tissues where applicable

## Measurements and analytical methods
- Stable elements:
  - Analysed in soils, vegetation, animal tissues, water, and fungi
  - Techniques: ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) with collision-cell and other modes; internal standards included Ge, Rh, Ir
  - Alkaline (TMAH) and acid digestions used; QA with certified reference materials and external standards
- Radionuclides:
  - K-40 and Cs-137 activity concentrations measured
  - Gamma analysis using hyper-pure germanium detectors; activity concentrations reported in Bq per kg dry mass (DM) or fresh mass (FM); MDA-based reporting for non-detects
- Data handling and reporting:
  - Concentrations reported with detection limits; results below detection reported as <LOD
  - Concentrations presented as mg kg-1 FM/DM/AM or mg L-1 for water; activity concentrations as Bq kg-1 DM/FM
  - Multiple analytical modes and quality checks, including proficiency testing participation

## Data products and structure
- 42 workbooks distributed across six data groups:
  - Sample information workbooks (n=4): species, sample descriptions, site and location, sample IDs, sex, FM/DM/AM, dimensions, notes, and sampling details (pH, LOI, depth)
  - Stable element Concentration (FM) workbooks (n=15): concentrations and LODs in mg kg-1 FM for vegetation and tissues; FM values for whole-organism components (roe deer, common frogs, wood mice); water concentrations in mg L-1
  - Stable element Concentration (DM) workbooks (n=9): concentrations and LODs in mg kg-1 DM for soil, vegetation, and tissues; AM values for European toads and bank voles; whole-organism DM for bees and earthworms
  - Radionuclide data workbooks (n=6): radionuclide activity concentrations for K-40 and Cs-137 (FM/DM) with two-sigma counting errors and MDAs; Cs-137 concentration ratios (CRs) based on FM/DM
  - Stable element Concentration Ratios (whole-organism FM) workbooks (n=8): CRs for Bees, Roe deer, Earthworms, Common frogs, European toads, Bank voles, Wood mice, and plant matrices (grass, pine needles, heartwood cores, etc.)
- Content coverage:
  - Tissue- and organism-level concentrations
  - Soil and water baselines
  - CRs comparing whole-organism concentrations to environmental media (soil or water)
  - Metadata describing sampling site, sample IDs, and analytical notes
- Documentation and references:
  - Detailed methodologies, digestion and analysis protocols, and QA procedures
  - References to ICRP RAPs, transfer parameter literature, and methodological standards
  - Acknowledgements for fieldwork, analysis, and funding (TREE project, RATE programme)

## Calculations and interpretation notes
- Whole-organism concentrations:
  - For roe deer: combined estimates from bone, muscle, liver, kidney, thyroid, and other tissues to approximate whole-body content
  - For wood mice: total bone and total muscle estimates plus liver and thyroid (for iodine) used to estimate whole-organism concentrations
  - For common frogs: muscle, bone, liver, gonads used to estimate whole-organism concentrations
  - For European toads: bone, muscle, liver, thyroid tissue used where possible
  - For CRs: calculated as concentration in whole-organism or tissue divided by concentration in soil or water (FM or DM basis as specified)
- Data handling for non-detects:
  - If a tissue contributes ≥10% to the total body content with below-LOD values, report as a <LOD-based value
  - If contribution is <10%, the estimated whole-organism concentration is treated as a reasonable approximation
- Specific limitations:
  - Iodine analysis in some tissues via TMAH extraction may underestimate total I, especially in pine heartwood cores or coarse samples
  - Some samples were not analysed; dataset includes notes indicating “No analysis conducted”
  - Complete dissolution challenges in certain tissues (e.g., bone-containing animal tissues) during digestion

## Data quality, accessibility, and use
- QA and provenance:
  - Use of certified reference materials (e.g., NIST standards) and participation in proficiency testing
  - Documentation of sample preparation, digestion methods, and analytical conditions
- Accessibility:
  - Data organized into structured workbooks designed for reuse in transfer-parameter modelling, RAP-based radiological protection assessments, and environmental monitoring
- Potential uses for analysts:
  - Derivation and validation of ICRP RAP transfer parameters for forests and temperate ecosystems
  - Modelling of radionuclide and stable-element uptake across trophic levels
  - Assessment of spatially-resolved concentration patterns and CRs in NE England forest ecosystems
