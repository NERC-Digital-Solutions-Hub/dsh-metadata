# TREE_Northumbria_Soil_Sample_Info

## Overview
- A structured soil-sample information schema used in environmental monitoring (Northumbria region, CEH context).
- Supports standardized data capture, quality assurance, and transformation to enable monitoring over time.
- Intended for storage and upload to appropriate data portals and for use in reports, maps, and charts.

## Data fields (with descriptions and units)
- CEH_Sample_Description: CEH sample name (no units)
- Site: Sampling site (no units)
- National_Grid_Reference: National grid reference of soil sampling site (no units)
- Date_Sample_Collected: Date sample collected (no units)
- CEH_Sample_Code: CEH sample code related to soil sample (no units)
- pH: pH of soil sample (no units)
- LOI: LOI of soil sample (no units)
- Soil_Sampling_Depth_cm: Soil sampling depth in cm (centimeters)
- Mass_Fresh_Soil_kg: Fresh mass of soil sample in kilograms (kilograms)
- Mass_Dry_Soil_kg: Dry mass of soil sample in kilograms (kilograms)

## Data quality and provenance
- Data are intended to be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed as part of standard monitoring workflows.
- Clear definitions and explanations accompany each field to support consistent interpretation.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to facilitate access and reuse.

## How it supports environmental monitoring
- Captures essential site, sample, and analytic variables (location, date, pH, LOI, depth, and masses) for time-series analysis.
- Enables standardised reporting, mapping, and policy performance assessment across monitoring programs.

## Challenges and opportunities for analysts
- Increase dataset value by integrating with complementary data sources (e.g., other environmental indicators).
- Improve accessibility of underlying data used to generate final outputs for broader scrutiny and reuse.
