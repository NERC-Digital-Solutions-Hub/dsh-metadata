# TREE_Northumbria_ICPMS_Frog_mg_per_tissue_FM_Concentration

## Purpose and scope
- Dataset documenting concentrations of multiple elements in total frog tissue (fresh mass) from Northumbria, enabling environmental health monitoring and assessment of policy performance over time.
- Supports scrutiny of contaminant exposure in amphibians and standardised reporting across sites and dates.

## Data content and structure
- Key identifiers and context:
  - Latin_Species_Name, Common_Species_Name
  - Site, Date_Sample_Collected
  - CEH_Sample_Code, CEH_Sample_Description
  - Tissue (type of frog tissue sampled)
- Measured concentrations (mg per total frog tissue fresh mass, FM) for a wide range of elements, including:
  - I, Li, Be, Na, Mg, Al, P, K, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Mo, Ag, Cd, Cs, Ba, Tl, Pb, U
- Notes on data values:
  - Some entries use a “<” marker to indicate concentrations below detection limits.
  - Some fields may be n/a (not applicable) or contain descriptive text rather than numerical data.

## Data quality, provenance, and handling
- Sourced from established monitoring activities (UKCEH/CEH sample codes and descriptions).
- Data undergo verification, quality assurance (QA), cleaning, and transformation before analysis.
- Outputs are prepared in standard formats (reports, maps, charts) and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Analytical use and reporting
- Enables standardized comparisons of environmental metal burdens in frogs over space and time.
- Supports development of environmental health indicators and policy performance reviews.
- Facilitates visualization and dissemination through maps, charts, and formal reports.

## Challenges and opportunities
- Enhancing dataset value by integrating with other environmental data (e.g., water, soil) and broader ecological datasets.
- Increasing accessibility to underlying data for transparency, reproducibility, and secondary analyses.
