# TREE_Northumbria_ICPMS_Toad_AM_Concentration

## Purpose and scope
- Standardised record of elemental concentrations in toad ash mass samples using ICP-MS.
- Supports monitoring of environmental health by providing comparable, ash-mass–based concentration data.

## Key fields and metadata
- Species information: Latin_Species_Name, Common_Species_Name.
- Sampling and sample identifiers: Site, Date_Sample_Collected, CEH_Sample_Code, CEH_Sample_Description.
- Sample processing and notes: Fresh_Mass_Ash_Mass_Ratio, Notes (preparation details).
- Concentration measurements (mg/kg on ash mass): I_mg_kg_AM, Li_mg_kg_AM, Be_mg_kg_AM, Na_mg_kg_AM, Mg_mg_kg_AM, Al_mg_kg_AM, P_mg_kg_AM, K_mg_kg_AM, Ca_mg_kg_AM, Ti_mg_kg_AM, V_mg_kg_AM, Cr_mg_kg_AM, Mn_mg_kg_AM, Fe_mg_kg_AM, Co_mg_kg_AM, Ni_mg_kg_AM, Cu_mg_kg_AM, Zn_mg_kg_AM, As_mg_kg_AM, Se_mg_kg_AM, Rb_mg_kg_AM, Sr_mg_kg_AM, Mo_mg_kg_AM, Ag_mg_kg_AM, Cd_mg_kg_AM, Cs_mg_kg_AM, Ba_mg_kg_AM, Tl_mg_kg_AM, Pb_mg_kg_AM, U_mg_kg_AM.
- Units and basis: Concentrations are in milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) on ash mass.

## Data quality and presentation
- Data are intended to be verified and quality assured as part of standard environmental monitoring workflows.
- Outputs are designed for clear presentation in reports, maps, and charts.

## Data management and accessibility
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to enable access to the underlying data used for final outputs.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring aims
- Provides a consistent format to evaluate environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Aligns with standardised approaches to data handling, analysis, and reporting for monitoring programs.

## Challenges and opportunities for analysts
- Increase dataset value by integrating these concentrations with additional environmental data.
- Improve accessibility of underlying data used to generate final outputs for broader use and scrutiny.
