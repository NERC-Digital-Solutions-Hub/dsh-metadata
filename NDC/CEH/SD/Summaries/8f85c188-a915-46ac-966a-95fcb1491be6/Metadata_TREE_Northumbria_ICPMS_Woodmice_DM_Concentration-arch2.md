# TREE_Northumbria_ICPMS_Woodmice_DM_Concentration

## Purpose and scope
- A multi-element concentration dataset for wood mice (Mus musculus) tissues from Northumbria, measured via ICPMS.
- Supports environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessment over time.
- Metadata and concentration data are structured for standard reporting and potential integration with other datasets.

## Dataset contents and metadata
- Species identifiers: Latin_Species_Name, Common_Species_Name
- Sampling context: Site, Date_Sample_Collected
- Sampling metadata: CEH_Sample_Codes, CEH_Sample_Description
- Biological sample details: Tissue, Fresh_Mass_Dry_Mass_Ratio
- Measurements: Concentrations given as I_mg_kg_DM and multiple other element columns (Li, Na, Mg, Al, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Cs, Ba, Tl, Pb, U) with units mg/kg dry mass
- Data flags: Detection-limit markers (<) used in several columns; some elements have two-part indicators (e.g., Sr_mg_kg_DM_1 and Sr_mg_kg_DM_2)
- Tissue-specific notes: No data for Hind Leg Bone and woodmouse 8 liver; some entries state “Tissue containing thyroid” where data are not available

## Data quality, processing and outputs
- Data verification, quality assurance, cleaning and transformation are applied to align with standard monitoring practices
- Analyses follow standardised methods to categorize or interpret environmental health metrics
- Outputs are presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts)
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for access and reuse

## Data gaps and caveats
- Notable missing data: Hind Leg Bone and woodmouse 8 liver
- Recurrent note: data are unavailable when tissue types are thyroid-containing for certain elements

## Access, sharing and value
- Emphasises enabling access to underlying data and combining with other relevant datasets to increase value beyond single-use outputs
