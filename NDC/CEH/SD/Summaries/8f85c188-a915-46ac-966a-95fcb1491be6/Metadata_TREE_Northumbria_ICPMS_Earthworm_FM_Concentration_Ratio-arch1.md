# TREE_Northumbria_ICPMS_Earthworm_FM_Concentration_Ratio

- Overview
  - A dataset describing concentration ratios of multiple elements in earthworms relative to the dry mass of surrounding soil.
  - The ratio is intended to quantify uptake/accumulation of elements by earthworms from soil, using fresh earthworm mass divided by soil dry mass.

  - Units and explanations
    - Most concentration ratio fields list Units = n/a
    - Explanations specify: “I Concentration Ratio (Fresh Mass Earthworm (wholebody) divided By Dry Mass Soil)” (and similarly for other elements)

- Calculation details
  - Concentration Ratio definition: Fresh Mass Earthworm (whole body) divided by Dry Mass Soil
  - U_Concentration_Ratio appears with two columns labeled 1 and 2, where 2 is described as the U Concentration Ratio; 1 is labeled as n/a

- Data quality and consistency considerations
  - The dataset metadata contains several typographical inconsistencies and odd formatting (e.g., “MnConcentration Ratio” phrasing, minor header typos, and inconsistent naming).
  - Many fields list units as n/a; actual units may be missing or unspecified.
  - The U_Concentration_Ratio has a two-part schema that may require clarification.
  - The presence of a paired “Co_Located_Soil_Sample_Used_To_Calculate_Concentration_Ratio” enhances traceability between earthworm and soil measurements but requires careful alignment.

- Potential uses and analyses
  - Compare element-specific accumulation ratios across species (Latin/Common names), sites, and collection dates.
  - Identify elements with consistently high or low uptake relative to soil concentrations.
  - Explore correlations between soil concentration and earthworm concentration ratios, accounting for site-level factors.
  - Build predictive models of uptake based on soil chemistry, species, and site metadata, subject to data quality and completeness.

- Practical considerations for analysts
  - Validate and clean the data to resolve typos and standardized variable naming.
  - Confirm units and ensure correct pairing between earthworm and soil samples using the co-located soil sample field.
  - Handle the two U_Concentration_Ratio columns appropriately to avoid misinterpretation.
  - Consider data provenance (CEH sample codes and descriptions) to track sample history and metadata.
