# Element and radionuclide concentrations in wildlife (including representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants) and associated soils from forests in north-east England, 2015-2016

## Aim and scope
- Presents data on stable element concentrations, radionuclide activity (K-40 and Cs-137), and concentration ratios (CRs) across soils, water, vegetation, fungi, invertebrates, and representative RAP species.
- Targets terrestrial species of the ICRP RAPs to inform environmental protection frameworks.

## Study area and sampling design
- Sampling sites: Holystone Woods and Kielder Forest (main areas); additional sampling in Redesdale and Spadeadam Forest, north-east England.
- Main study areas: Holystone (~0.06 km2) and Redesdale (~0.16 km2) with varied soils; sampling sites mapped by NGR and GPS (~5 m accuracy).
- Sampling period: March 2015 to October 2016.
- Sample types and scope: soils, water, grasses, trees, herbaceous plants, shrubs, fungi, earthworms, bees, wood mice, bank voles, roe deer, common frogs, frogspawn, European toads.

## Species and samples collected
- Terrestrial wildlife and soils from representative RAPs and ecosystems.
- Tissue and whole-organism samples collected and prepared for analysis, with special attention to mass, dimensions, and tissue-specific contributions to whole-organism concentrations.

## Laboratory methods and data processing
- Stable element analysis:
  - ICP-MS with collision/reaction-cell options (He-cell, STD, H2-cell); internal standards Ge, Rh, Ir; multi-element calibration standards.
  - Sample digestion: primarily acid digestion for vegetation and animal tissues; TMAH alkaline extraction for select elements; two digestion approaches (acid and TMAH) for iodine considerations.
  - Units: mg kg-1 (FM, DM, AM as applicable) and mg L-1 for water.
- Radionuclide analysis:
  - Gamma analysis using hyper-pure germanium detectors; activity concentrations reported as Bq kg-1 dry mass (DM) or fresh mass (FM) with two-sigma errors and minimum detectable activity (MDA).
- Data quality and reporting:
  - QA procedures included use of standard reference materials, blanks, and proficiency testing; LODs reported; notes on incomplete digestion or low dissolution in some samples.
  - Iodine determined using specific matrices (TMAH) with attention to recovery and calibration.
  
## Whole-organism concentration calculations
- For roe deer and small mammals, total concentrations estimated from analyzed tissues (bone, muscle, liver, kidney, thyroid, gonad, etc.) using site- and animal-specific mass estimates.
- For amphibians (frogs, toads) and invertebrates (earthworms, bees), whole-organism concentrations derived from tissue data or bulked samples where appropriate.
- Cs-137 assumed muscle-equivalent for whole-organism activity; where tissues under detection limits contributed ≥10% to total content, results flagged as “less than” values.
- CRs calculated relative to soil or water concentrations; for plants and fungi, CRwo-soil values estimated per tissue/component; for RAP pine, CRwo reflects trunk geometry per ICRP 2008.

## Data structure and contents
- Total datasets: 42 workbooks, categorized as:
  - Sample information (n=4): species, sampling site/location/NGR, sample codes, sex, FM/DM/AM where recorded, animal dimensions, preparation notes, soil depth, pH, LOI.
  - Stable element concentrations (FM) (n=15): concentrations and LODs in vegetation and tissues of roe deer, common frogs (and frogspawn), wood mice; water concentrations in mg L-1.
  - Stable element concentrations (DM) (n=9): concentrations and LODs in soil, vegetation, and tissues; AM reported for European toads and bank voles; DM values for whole-organism in bees and earthworms.
  - Radionuclide data (n=6): radionuclide activities for K-40 and Cs-137 (FM/DM or both) with two-sigma errors and MDAs; Cs-137 concentration ratios (CRs) based on FM/DM.
  - Stable element concentration ratios (FM) (n=8): CRs for bees, roe deer, earthworms, common frogs, European toads, bank voles, wood mice, and plant groups (wild grasses, pines, herbaceous plants, and fungi).
- Data coverage: soil, water, vegetation, fungi, invertebrates, small mammals, and large mammals; includes both fresh and dry mass bases, with tissue-specific contributions and CRs.

## Outputs and potential use
- Provides parameter-rich input for ICRP RAP-based environmental transfer modelling and risk assessment.
- Enables cross-taxa comparisons of metal and radionuclide uptake and informs data-driven environmental protection decisions.
- Supports meta-analyses and model validation efforts in terrestrial biota radiological protection.
