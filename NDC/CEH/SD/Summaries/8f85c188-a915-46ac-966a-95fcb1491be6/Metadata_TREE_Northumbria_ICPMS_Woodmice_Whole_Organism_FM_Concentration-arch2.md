# TREE_Northumbria_ICPMS_Woodmice_Whole_Organism_FM_Concentration

## Purpose and context
- Dataset documenting concentrations of multiple elements in wood mouse whole-organism tissue (fresh mass) using ICP-MS.
- Aimed at environmental monitoring to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Data scope and key fields
- Taxon and sampling identifiers: Latin_Species_Name, Common_Species_Name, Site, Date_Sample_Collected.
- Sample metadata: CEH_Sample_Description, Notes (tissues used to calculate whole-organism concentrations).
- Concentration data: I_mg_kg_whole-organism_FM and a wide suite of element-specific columns (Li, Na, Mg, Al, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Cs, Ba, Tl, Pb, U) all in mg/kg (fresh mass).
- Special markers: <I, <Ni, <Ag, <U indicate less-than values for the corresponding concentration columns, with explanations in metadata.

## Data quality, processing, and standardization
- Data are verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed.
- Analyses follow standardized methods producing outputs such as concentration values relative to environmental standards.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for access and reuse.

## Outputs and usage
- Enables consistent comparison of environmental exposure across sites and time.
- Supports assessment of environmental health against standards and policy performance.

## Accessibility and data sharing considerations
- A key challenge is increasing dataset value by linking with other relevant data sources.
- Emphasis on enabling access to the underlying data used to produce final outputs.

## Notable conventions and notes
- Concentrations reported as mg/kg fresh mass.
- Notes clarify tissues used to derive whole-organism concentrations and interpretation of less-than values.
