# TREE_Northumbria_ICPMS_Earthworm_DM_Concentration

- Overview
  - A metadata/dictionary-style dataset describing concentrations of multiple elements in earthworms, measured by ICP-MS and expressed on a dry mass basis (mg/kg_DM).
  - Associated with Northumbria/UKCEH sampling, including species, site, sample codes, and descriptive notes.
  - Intended for sharing, discovery, and reuse within data catalogs, with attention to governance and data quality.

  - Data interpretation notes
    - Each element concentration is stated as milligrams per kilogram dry mass (mg/kg_DM).
    - Some field explanations in the source text may contain typographical inconsistencies (e.g., Tl_mg_kg_DM_). Data stewards should harmonize field names and ensure consistent metadata terminology.

- Metadata/documentation considerations for Data Stewards
  - Data standards alignment
    - Ensure consistent naming for species, site, sample codes, and descriptions.
    - Confirm all element fields use mg/kg_DM and that units are standardized across the dataset.
  - Provenance and traceability
    - Link CEH_Sample_Codes to the underlying UKCEH sampling event records.
    - Maintain clear notes on sampling context and any UK origin details.
  - Data quality and validation
    - Validate numeric concentration values and handle any missing or zero values appropriately.
    - Check for and resolve any typographical quirks in field names (e.g., stray underscores) to maintain interoperability.
  - Metadata completeness
    - Ensure Latin and Common species names are present and consistent.
    - Verify Site and Date_Sample_Collected fields provide sufficient context for discovery and re-use.
  - Update and sharing considerations
    - Document data processing steps (quality assurance, cleaning, transformations) if applied.
    - Establish clear update pathways to reflect new data in portals/catalogues and to respect any sharing restrictions or embargoes.
  - Interoperability and accessibility
    - Prepare a controlled vocabulary for sites and species to enable cross-dataset discovery.
    - Align with broader data governance practices to facilitate integration with other Northumbria/UKCEH datasets.

- Key governance actions for effective stewardship
  - Create or enforce a data dictionary alignment across datasets to prevent inconsistent field names and units.
  - Implement metadata templates capturing essential fields (species, site, date, sample codes, descriptions, notes, element concentrations with units).
  - Establish data quality checks for element concentration ranges and unit consistency.
  - Maintain traceability to CEH sample codes and provide clear update mechanisms for revised data.
  - Document any data sharing constraints and ensure they are reflected in catalog metadata and access controls.

- End-to-end considerations
  - Beginning: Collect and record accurate metadata for species, site, date, and sample identifiers; ensure units are mg/kg_DM for all concentrations.
  - Middle: Quality assure concentration data across all listed elements; harmonize field names and resolve any data format inconsistencies.
  - End: Upload to relevant data portals/catalogues, with accompanying metadata and documentation of any processing steps or embargoes, and prepare for future updates.
