# Column heading explanations and materials and methods for: Spatial radionuclide deposition data from the 60 km area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant: results from a sampling survey in 1987

## Context and objectives
- Dataset collected to enable long-term monitoring and contamination mapping of the 60-km zone around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP).
- Data describe surface soil contamination by radionuclides and in situ gamma dose rates, using a standardized radial sampling network established in 1987.
- Measurements are intended to support environmental health assessments and policy-relevant monitoring over time.

## Sampling design and field methods
- Radial network covering 60 km from ChNPP, with sampling points every 10° (from 10° to 360° clockwise).
- Distances from ChNPP: 5, 6, 7, 8.3, 10, 12, 14.7, 17, 20, 25, 30, 37.5, 45, 52.5, and 60 km (total planned points: 540).
- Geo-referencing performed using maps and topography.
- At 489 of 540 selected points (all except swamps, rivers, and lakes), soil samples were collected.
- Soil sampling: 14 cm diameter corer, 5 cm depth; at each site, five sub-samples collected in an envelope sampling design (about 5–10 m between points); five cores combined to form a site sample; samples kept intact during transport.
- Dose rate measurements: equivalent dose rate in air measured at 1 m above ground at each site.

## Laboratory analysis and isotopes measured
- One soil sample per site analyzed in a 1 L Marinelli container using high-purity germanium gamma spectroscopy (GEM-30185 ORTEC) with ADCAM-300, reporting results at 68% confidence.
- Additional four cores from each site sent to other laboratories in the Soviet Union (data for these cores not available in this dataset).
- Leaching test for exchangeable Cs: 100 g soil digested with 1 M NH4OAc solution (pH 7) at 1:5 solid-to-liquid ratio; shake 1 h, settle ~1 day, filter, analyze extract for exchangeable Cs-134+Cs-137.
- Reported radionuclide densities (Bq m^-2) include 95Zr, 95Nb, 106Ru, 134Cs, 137Cs, 144Ce, and the exchangeable fraction of 134+137Cs; dose rate in air (mR h^-1) at 1 m height.
- Units and column definitions provided (e.g., Bq m^-2, mR h^-1, degrees, kilometers, dates).

## Data calculation, quality, and reporting
- Contamination density expressed as Bq m^-2, with 1 Ci km^-2 equating to 37 kBq m^-2.
- Measurements reported with 68% confidence intervals; relative uncertainties for each nuclide are provided (e.g., Cs-137, Cs-134, etc.).
- Uncertainty for estimating a site-average contamination from a single 0.015 m^2 soil core can be up to ~50%.
- Date of gamma measurement corresponds to the date of analysis, with samples analyzed within ~1.5 months of collection.

## Data handling, notes, and limitations
- Empty cells indicate data not available (e.g., certain measurements or missing values).
- One site’s core data are included for analysis, while data from the remaining cores were not available in this publication.
- Data describe measurements taken at the date of sampling and are intended to support interpretation of spatial deposition patterns and long-term monitoring.

## Relevance for monitoring and use
- Provides standardized, geo-referenced measurements suitable for time-series comparisons and integration with other environmental datasets.
- Focus on both total radionuclide deposition and the exchangeable fraction, supporting interpretation of mobility and potential bioavailability.
- Methodology and measurement uncertainties documented to facilitate quality assessment, replication, and data integration into monitoring portals.
