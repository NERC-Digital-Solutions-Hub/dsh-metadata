# Column heading explanations and materials and methods for: Spatial radionuclide deposition data from the 60 km area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant: results from a sampling survey in 1987

- Objective
  - Enable long-term monitoring and contamination mapping of the 60-km zone around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) through a radial sampling network established in 1987.
  - Provide data products (dose rates and radionuclide contamination densities) to support data use and interpretation.

- Sampling design and fieldwork
  - Radial network of points every 10° (10° to 360° clockwise) at distances of 5, 6, 7, 8.3, 10, 12, 14.7, 17, 20, 25, 30, 37.5, 45, 52.5 and 60 km (540 planned points; 489 sampled).
  - Geo-referenced using maps and topography; sampling excluded points in swamps, rivers, and lakes.
  - Soil sampling at each site using a 14 cm diameter, 5 cm deep corer; five sub-samples per site collected within ~5–10 m (envelope sampling design).

- Data collection and analysis (measurements)
  - Dose rate in air measured at 1 m height above ground at each sampling site.
  - One soil sample per site analyzed for gamma-emitting radionuclides; other four cores sent to different Soviet laboratories.
  - Radionuclide analysis performed with a high-purity germanium detector (GEM-30185 ORTEC) and ADCAM-300 multichannel analyser; 68% confidence level.
  - Exchangeable Cs-134+Cs-137 measured via leaching: 100 g soil with 1 M NH4OAc (pH 7), shake 1 h, rest 1 day, filter, analyze with Gedetector.

- Radionuclide data and units
  - Measured densities of soil contamination (Bq/m^2) for: Zr-95, Nb-95, Ru-106, Cs-134, Cs-137, Ce-144 (with 68% confidence uncertainties).
  - Exchangeable fraction: density of Cs-134+Cs-137 in exchangeable form (Bq/m^2).
  - Data include the date of gamma activity measurement (within ~1.5 months of collection).
  - Relationship between discrete sample and site-average uncertainty: approximately up to 50% for site-average estimates (Khomutinin et al., 2019).

- Data reporting and interpretation notes
  - Empty cells indicate data not available.
  - Reported values correspond to the measurement date; samples analyzed within 1.5 months of collection.
  - Area represented by one sampling core is 0.015 m^2 (used to convert activity concentrations to densities).

- Instrumentation and data provenance
  - Primary measurements: GEM-30185 ORTEC gamma spectrometer with semiconductor detector.
  - Data processing via Gedetector for exchangeable cesium measurements.
