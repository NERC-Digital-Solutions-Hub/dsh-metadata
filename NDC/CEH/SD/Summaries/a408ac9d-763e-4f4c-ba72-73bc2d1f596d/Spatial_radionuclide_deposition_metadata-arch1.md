# Spatial radionuclide deposition data from the 60 km area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant: results from a sampling survey in 1987

## Overview
- Aimed to enable long-term monitoring and contamination mapping of the 60-km zone around ChNPP.
- Establishes a radial sampling network of 540 points (sampling every 10° from 10° to 360°; distances: 5, 6, 7, 8.3, 10, 12, 14.7, 17, 20, 25, 30, 37.5, 45, 52.5, 60 km).
- 489 of the 540 points were actually sampled (some points excluded due to swamps, rivers, and lakes).
- Data described include gamma radionuclide concentrations, dose rates, and derived soil contamination densities with uncertainties.

## Sampling design and field methods
- Radial sampling network referenced against ChNPP with geo-referencing based on maps/topography.
- At each site, soil was collected from five nearby points using envelope sampling (approx. 5–10 m between points); cores kept intact during transport.
- One 14 cm diameter, 5 cm deep core per site analyzed; the remaining four cores sent to different Soviet laboratories (data not available).
- Sampling area per core: 0.015 m², used to compute contamination density (Bq m⁻²) from activity concentrations.
- Date of gamma measurement recorded; some sampling sites were water bodies with no sampling.

## Measurements and laboratory methods
- Gamma activity measured with a high-purity germanium detector (GEM-30185 ORTEC) and ADCAM-300, reporting results at 68% confidence.
- Analyzed radionuclides: 95Zr+95Nb, 106Ru, 134Cs, 137Cs, 144Ce; and exchangeable 134Cs+137Cs.
- Other cores analyzed by Gedetector; specifics for those results are not provided.
- Dose rate in air measured at 1 m above ground (Exposure_dose_rate_mR/h).

## Data included in the dataset
- Dose rate in air at 1 m height (mR/h) and date of gamma measurement.
- Soil contamination densities (Bq m⁻²) for:
  - 95Zr, 95Nb
  - 106Ru
  - 134Cs
  - 137Cs
  - 144Ce
  - Exchangeable 134Cs+137Cs
  - Each with associated relative uncertainty (68% confidence interval).
- Units and conversion notes:
  - 1 Ci km⁻² = 37 kBq m⁻²
  - Data points reported with 68% confidence; uncertainties may be up to ~50% for site-wide averages from a single core (per cited work).
- Empty cells indicate unavailable data.
- Instrument information: GEM-30185 ORTEC gamma spectrometer (two possible configurations noted) with results at 68% CL.

## Data quality, limitations, and context
- Uncertainty in site-mean estimates can be large when derived from a single soil core.
- Some cores’ data are not accessible (data for four cores per site were not reported here).
- Measurements were conducted within 1.5 months of sample collection, reflecting a near-term post-collection analysis window.
- Focused on the 60-km zone around ChNPP to support long-term monitoring and spatial deposition mapping.

## Uses and implications
- Provides a historical, spatially resolved dataset suitable for environmental radioactivity studies, exposure assessment, and calibration/validation of contamination models.
- Can inform emergency response planning and long-term environmental surveillance in similar settings.
