# Spatial radionuclide deposition data from the 60 km area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant: results from a sampling survey in 1987

## Overview
- Presents dose-rate and soil contamination data collected in 1987 for the 60-km zone around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) to enable long-term monitoring and contamination mapping.
- Establishes a radial sampling network to support environmental health monitoring and policy assessment.
- Key measured quantities include dose rate in air at 1 m height and soil densities of various radionuclides, with associated uncertainties.
- Data are reported as densities (Bq m^-2) and dose rates (mR/h), with 68% confidence intervals; some data gaps and limitations are noted.

## Sampling design and collection methods
- Radial network: sample points every 10° around the ChNPP, at radii of 5, 6, 7, 8.3, 10, 12, 14.7, 17, 20, 25, 30, 37.5, 45, 52.5 and 60 km (540 potential points; 489 actually sampled).
- Georeferencing performed using maps and topography.
- In swampy, river, and lake areas, sampling did not occur at certain points.
- At each site, soils were collected with a 14 cm diameter, 5 cm deep corer; five sub-samples (envelope design) were taken within ~5–10 m of each other and combined to represent the site.
- Dose rate in air was measured at 1 m above ground at each sampling point.

## Analytes, measurements, and data structure
- Analytes analyzed per site: gamma-emitting radionuclides 95Zr+95Nb, 106Ru, 134Cs, 137Cs, 144Ce; exchangeable 134Cs+137Cs form.
- One soil sample per site analyzed in a 1 L Marinelli container using a high-purity germanium detector (GEM-30185 ORTEC) and ADCAM-300; results reported at 68% confidence level.
- Other four cores were sent to different laboratories in the Soviet Union; data for these cores are not available.
- A 100 g aliquot was leached with 1 M NH4OAc at pH 7 to determine the exchangeable Cs-134+Cs-137 fraction.
- Contamination density calculated from measured activities using 1 Ci km^-2 = 37 kBq m^-2, accounting for the sampled area (0.015 m^2 per site).
- Reported measurements include: dose rate in air (mR/h), date of gamma activity measurement, densities of contamination for 95Zr, 95Nb, 106Ru, 134Cs, 137Cs, 144Ce (with uncertainties), and density of exchangeable 134+137Cs (with uncertainties).
- Data availability: measurements date to the sampling date (samples analyzed within ~1.5 months of collection); empty cells denote missing data.

## Data quality, uncertainties, and limitations
- Uncertainties: radionuclide activity concentrations reported with 68% confidence; site-average uncertainty can be as high as ~50% (per referenced methods).
- Missing data: some cores from other laboratories are not available; some isotopes or measurements are not reported for certain sites (empty cells).
- Sampling limits: cannot sample in certain water-borne locations; long-term interpretation requires caution due to temporal proximity to the 1987 event and limited replication.
- Metadata availability: explicit explanations accompany many fields; however, some data gaps and provenance details are limited by the original study context.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy use
- Demonstrates a structured, geometry-based approach to environmental monitoring that supports long-term contamination mapping and dose assessment.
- Provides a baseline dataset with spatial coverage suitable for evaluating deposition patterns and informing emergency response planning and post-accident health risk assessments.
- Highlights data governance considerations relevant to monitoring frameworks: multi-lab data origins, partial data availability, and the need for clear metadata and data-sharing practices to enable reuse and transparency.
- Typical challenges echoed in monitoring programs: data gaps, access to all contributing datasets, and barriers to sharing datasets publicly; underscores the importance of QA, documentation, and standardized reporting to enhance policy-relevant analysis.
