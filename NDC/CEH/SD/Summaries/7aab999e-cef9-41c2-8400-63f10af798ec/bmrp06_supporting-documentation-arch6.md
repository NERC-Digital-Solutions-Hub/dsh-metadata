# Theoretical model of exploitative leadership in collective violence

## Overview
- A theoretical model of leadership in warfare by exploitative individuals who reap benefits from conflict while avoiding costs.
- Extends the hawk-dove model to pairwise group interactions where a randomly chosen leader influences the group’s tactics (aggressive vs. peaceful).
- Allows unequal sharing of fitness payoffs: leaders may gain a larger share of benefits or bear a smaller share of costs than followers.
- Shows how such leadership can explain the evolution of severe collective violence in certain animal societies.

## Data generation and inputs
- Based on a Mathematica script (text format) that implements the theoretical model.
- Data produced through simulations of group encounters where an individual is chosen as leader and followers are the rest of the group.

## Analytical methods
- Model structure: pairwise encounters between groups of size n; leader decides hawk or dove tactics.
- Payoffs: total group payoffs align with the classic model, with added unequal sharing (leaders vs followers) for benefits and costs.
- Predictions: extreme intergroup aggression evolves when initiators can trigger whole-group conflicts and gain disproportionate benefits or incur lower costs.
- Implication: destructive warfare can result from the decoupling of leaders from the costs they incite.
