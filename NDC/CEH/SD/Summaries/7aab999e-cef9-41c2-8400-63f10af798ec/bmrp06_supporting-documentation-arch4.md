# Theoretical model of exploitative leadership in collective violence

## Overview
- A theoretical model of leadership in warfare by exploitative individuals who benefit from conflict while avoiding costs.
- Extends the classic hawk-dove model to pairwise group interactions where a randomly chosen leader influences group strategy (aggressive hawk vs. peaceful dove).
- Allows unequal sharing of fitness payoffs, enabling leaders to gain a larger share of benefits or incur lower costs than followers.
- Demonstrates how such leadership can explain the evolution of severe collective violence in some animal societies.

## Model and methods
- Pairwise encounters between groups of size n; a leader is randomly selected, followers form the rest.
- The leader decides the group’s tactic (hawk or dove) through disproportionate influence.
- Payoffs mirror the classic model but include asymmetrical sharing: followers’ share of benefits is reduced; leaders’ share of costs is reduced.
- Key prediction: extreme intergroup aggression evolves when initiators can mobilize the whole group and gain disproportionate benefits or bear lower costs than others.

## Key insights
- Destructive warfare can arise from decoupling leaders from the costs they incite.
- The model accounts for scenarios where a subset of members can trigger broad conflicts, with leaders benefiting more or bearing fewer costs relative to followers.
