# Theoretical model of exploitative leadership in collective violence

- Purpose: A theoretical model of leadership in warfare by exploitative individuals who reap benefits from conflict while avoiding costs, extending the hawk-dove framework to intergroup pairwise encounters.

- Core idea: A randomly chosen leader can influence group behavior, choosing aggressive (hawk) or peaceful (dove) tactics; leaders may obtain a larger share of benefits or incur lower costs than followers, enabling leadership to steer collective outcomes.

- Key finding: Extreme intergroup aggression can evolve when initiators can trigger group-wide conflicts and gain disproportionately from fighting or incur fewer costs, effectively decoupling leadership costs from the costs they incite.

- Scope of application: Demonstrates how destructive warfare can arise from leadership dynamics that separate leaders from the consequences of their actions within the group.

- Data and structure overview (from a stewardship perspective):
  - Data type and format: Mathematica-based theoretical model saved as a text script.
  - Data file: BMRP06_01_theoretical_model_collective_violence (single .txt file containing the model and results).
  - Inputs and outputs: Parameters and analytical methods yield results and plots illustrating model behavior; outputs are derived from simulations/analyses rather than empirical datasets.

- Access, licensing, and citation:
  - License: Open Government Licence v3.
  - Citation requirement: Johnstone, R.A.; Thompson, F.J.; Cant, M.A. (2022). Theoretical model of exploitative leadership in collective violence. NERC Environmental Information Data Centre. (Model). DOI provided.
  - Access options: Mathematica script; if no Mathematica, can run via Wolfram Cloud (free tier for non-organizational use).

- Quality control and reproducibility:
  - Quality checks: Script was checked for coding errors; results plotted to visualize outcomes and check for inconsistencies.
  - Reproducibility considerations: Requires Mathematica or Wolfram Cloud to execute; provenance provided via citation and file naming.

- Metadata and documentation considerations for data stewards:
  - Document purpose, model assumptions, parameters, and expected outputs to support reuse.
  - Provide a data dictionary or metadata describing each parameter, its role, and acceptable ranges.
  - Include instructions for running the model, interpreting outputs, and replicating figures.
  - Consider exporting results to interoperable formats (e.g., JSON/YAML for metadata, CSV/TSV for tabular outputs) to complement the primary Mathematica script.
  - Ensure licensing and attribution are clearly stated in repository metadata and README.

- Governance and archiving implications:
  - Because this is a theoretical model rather than a raw empirical dataset, ensure clear versioning and changelog for model updates.
  - Store the script and any generated results together with a README detailing usage, assumptions, and limitations.
  - Provide a stable DOI or persistent identifier if possible to facilitate long-term access and citation.
