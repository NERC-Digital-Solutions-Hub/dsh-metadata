# Theoretical model of exploitative leadership in collective violence

## Overview
- A theoretical model of leadership in warfare by exploitative individuals who reap benefits from conflict while avoiding its costs.
- Extends the classic hawk-dove model to pairwise group encounters where a randomly chosen leader decides whether the group adopts aggressive (hawk) or peaceful (dove) tactics.
- Incorporates unequal sharing of fitness payoffs: leaders can obtain a larger share of benefits or bear a reduced share of costs compared to followers.
- Demonstrates how such leadership can explain the evolution of severe collective violence in certain animal societies.

## Analytical methods
- Pairwise group encounters with groups of size n.
- Leader is randomly selected; the leader’s choice dictates group tactic (hawk or dove) through their disproportionate influence.
- Payoffs mirror the classic hawk-dove model but include unequal sharing: followers’ share of benefits is reduced; leaders bear a reduced share of any costs.
- Predictions: extreme intergroup aggression evolves when initiators can mobilize the whole group and gain disproportionate benefits or incur lower costs than others.
- Implication: destructive warfare can arise from leaders’ decoupling from the costs they incite.

## Outputs and predictions
- The model yields theoretical conditions under which high aggression emerges at the group level.
- Highlights the role of leadership and payoff sharing in driving collective violence dynamics.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring analysts
- Demonstrates a standardized, reproducible modeling approach with explicit data structure (text file) and transparent methodology.
- Emphasizes replication, quality checks, and clear outputs (plots) that align with core monitoring practices.
- While focused on collective violence, the framework illustrates how leaders influence group-level decisions and how payoff structures can be altered, a conceptizable analogue for environmental management and governance where leadership and cost-benefit allocations shape collective outcomes.
