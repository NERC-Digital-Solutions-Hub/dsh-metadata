# Theoretical model of exploitative leadership in collective violence

## Overview
- Presents a theoretical model of leadership in warfare by exploitative individuals who gain from conflict while avoiding costs.
- Extends the classic hawk-dove model to pairwise group interactions where a randomly chosen leader can steer the group toward aggressive (hawk) or peaceful (dove) tactics.
- Allows unequal sharing of fitness payoffs, so leaders can obtain larger benefits or incur lower costs than followers.
- Demonstrates how such leadership can explain the evolution of severe collective violence in certain animal societies.

## Model and Assumptions
- Encounters are pairwise between groups of size n; a leader is randomly selected within a group.
- The leader’s influence determines whether the group adopts hawk or dove tactics.
- Fitness payoffs for the group mirror the classic model, with added flexibility for unequal sharing:
  - Followers receive a reduced share of benefits from fighting.
  - Followers bear higher costs relative to the leader; the leader’s cost share is reduced.
- Key predictions:
  - Extreme intergroup aggression evolves when a subset of group members can initiate conflicts affecting the entire group and initiators gain disproportionate benefits or incur lower costs.
  - Destructive warfare can result from leaders becoming decoupled from the costs they trigger.

  - Software requirements: Mathematica (2022) or run via Wolfram Cloud (free tier for non-organizational use).

## Running and Reproducibility
- Quality control: script checked for coding errors; results plotted to visualize and check for inconsistencies.
- Reproducibility notes:
  - If you lack Mathematica, use Wolfram Cloud to execute the script.
  - The approach is theoretical/simulation-based rather than empirical data analysis.

## Practical Relevance for Analysts
- Provides a formal framework to analyze how leadership structure and unequal payoff sharing can drive collective violence.
- Useful for exploring scenarios and predictions about when exploitative leadership leads to high aggression.
- Can inform data-driven extensions by simulating outcomes and guiding hypotheses for empirical testing with real-world data.
