# Theoretical model of exploitative leadership in collective violence

- Purpose and scope
  - A theoretical model of leadership in warfare by exploitative individuals who reap benefits from conflict while avoiding costs.
  - Extends the classic hawk-dove model to pairwise interactions between groups, where a randomly chosen leader influences whether the group adopts aggressive (hawk) or peaceful (dove) tactics.
  - Allows unequal sharing of fitness payoffs, enabling the leader to obtain a larger share of benefits or pay a reduced share of costs.
  - Explains how extreme levels of intergroup violence can evolve in certain contexts.

- Methods
  - Analytical extension of hawk-dove to pairwise group encounters with group size n.
  - In each encounter, a leader is randomly selected; the rest are followers.
  - The leader’s decision governs group tactics, via their disproportionate influence on group behaviour.
  - Payoffs are equivalent to the classic model but include unequal sharing: followers receive a reduced share of benefits; leaders bear a reduced share of costs relative to followers.

- Key predictions
  - Extreme intergroup aggression evolves when a subset of group members can initiate conflicts affecting the whole group and initiators gain disproportionate benefits or incur lower costs.
  - Destructive warfare can result from the decoupling of leaders from the costs they incite.

- Quality control
  - The script was checked for coding errors.
  - Results were plotted to visualize outcomes and check for inconsistencies.

- Data structure
  - The work is a Mathematica script stored as a text file.
  - Data is contained in one text file: BMRP06_01_theoretical_model_collective_violence.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks (for the archetype)
  - Illustrates how theoretical models can be encapsulated as data-enabled tools for policy evaluation and scenario analysis.
  - Highlights data governance considerations: reproducibility, metadata, and sharing of outputs.
  - Demonstrates the importance of documenting data structures, access rights, and licensing to support transparent monitoring and decision-making.
