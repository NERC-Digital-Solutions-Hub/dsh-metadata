# The Ribble/Wyre observatory: Major, minor and trace elements in rivers draining from rural headwaters to the heartlands of the NW England historic industrial base

## Aim and scope
- Establish a basin-wide monitoring framework to demonstrate environmental condition in a consistent, time-series format.
- Use data to assess environmental health and policy performance across rural headwaters to urban/industrial influence in the Ribble and Wyre basins.
- Emphasize standardized data collection, QA, and clear outputs (reports, maps, charts) for ongoing scrutiny and decision-making.
- Seek to increase the value of monitoring datasets and enable access to underlying data for broader use.

## Study area and basins
- Ribble and Wyre basins in northwest England, with areas of 1133, 231, 136, and 314 km2 (Ribble, Douglas, Darwen, Wyre respectively).
- Landscape includes upland moorlands, valleys with grassland and dairy farming, and urban/industrial cores in the Ribble catchment.
- Soils: predominantly deep loams; significant peat and peaty loams; geology largely carboniferous with Triassic sandstones in parts.
- Land use transitions from rural uplands to urban/industrial towns (e.g., Accrington, Blackburn, Burnley, Wigan) near the Ribble’s lower reaches; Wyre more rural with Garstang as a notable town.
- Hydrology ranges from flashy upland rivers to groundwater-dominated lowland rivers; reservoirs contribute to flow regimes in several catchments.

## Monitoring design and site selection
- Basin-wide assessment used field surveys and GIS data on geology, relief, agriculture, point sources, septic tanks, and population.
- 26 monitoring sites selected to cover a wide range of rural, agricultural, and urban/industrial settings.
- Catchment characterization used FEH CD-ROM v3.0 to estimate catchment area and mean altitude.
- Population and sewage inputs (STW) identified as key controls on water quality; septic tanks significant in rural areas.
- Flow regimes varied by catchment; high flows at Ribble and Calder; reservoirs could influence sediment suspension.

## Main sampling program and site categories
- Main stem (Ribble):
  - Upper to lower: R4 near Gisburn (rural upper Ribble), R5 near Great Mitton (downstream of Clitheroe but upstream of major urban inputs), R7 at Ribchester (downstream of industrial inputs but upstream of tidal estuary).
- Ribble tributaries:
  - Hodder (rural signal) and Calder (urban/industrial signal) plus Darwen and Douglas (major tributaries with mixed impacts).
- Hodder tributaries: Dunsop at Dunsop Bridge; Loud near confluence; lower Hodder.
- Calder: Pendle Water at Barrowford; Colne at Barrowford; Calder at Altham Bridge; Hyndburn Brook at Hyndburn Bridge; Calder at Whalley.
- Douglas: Yarrow near Chorley; Douglas at Adlington, Standish, Parbold; Tawd at Hoscar; Eller Brook at Briars Lane; Douglas at Grimshaw Green.
- Darwen: Roach Bridge near the tidal limit.
- Wyre: Tarnbrook Wyre at Stoops Bridge; Marshaw Wyre at Marshaw Bridge; Wyre at Abbeystead Weir; Wyre at Garstang Bridge; Calder at Calderbridge (Wyre side); Brock at Bilsborough; Wyre at St Michaels (downstream limit).
- Overall: 26 sites capturing upland to lowland, rural to urban/industrial transitions across both basins.

## Sampling and analytical methods
- Sampling frequency: fortnightly for the first year, then monthly.
- Field methods: sampling at bridges using weighted polypropylene samplers; measure water temperature; record weather, field conditions, and water height.
- Sample types and preservation: major solutes, pH, Gran alkalinity, trace metals (including high Al and Fe), mercury, chlorophyll; preserved and stored in appropriate bottles; protection to avoid contamination.
- Laboratory analyses and parameters:
  - Major solutes, pH, Gran alkalinity, conductivity, DOM absorbance at 340 nm.
  - Nutrients: soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), ammonium-nitrogen (NH4N), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), dissolved hydrolysable phosphorus (DHP).
  - Mercury: total Hg measured after preservation.
  - Trace metals: Al, Fe, and a suite of others by ICP-OES/MS.
  - Anions: chloride, nitrate, sulfate by ion chromatography.
  - Organic and nitrogen forms: dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), organic nitrogen by difference.
- Filtration and preparation: filtration of samples for dissolved/particulate distinction; acidification (1% nitric acid) for metal analyses; strict handling to minimize artefacts.
- Instruments and accreditation: ICP-OES for major elements; ICP-MS for trace metals; IC for major anions; TOC analyzer for DOC/TDN; UV-Vis for absorbance; mercury analysis by cold-vapour fluorescence; methods largely ISO 17025 accredited; internal QC, certified references, and proficiency testing used.
- Data nuance: "dissolved" fraction includes some colloidal material; effort to avoid filter overloading; references acknowledge colloidal contributions in similar rivers.
- Flow-based concentration context: use Environment Agency gauging data to estimate average concentrations at low and high flows by ranking site data in flow order and taking bottom/top 10% of flow values (nearest gauge used if needed).

## Data handling and interpretation
- EpCO2 calculations derived from pH and Gran alkalinity; higher/lower EpCO2 reflect gas exchange with the atmosphere.
- Data treatment for non-detects: values kept as measured (not rounded or substituted), to minimize artefacts in averages and trend analyses.
- Emphasis on linking chemical signals to catchment controls: urban/industrial inputs, rural/agricultural inputs, septic tanks, and sewage treatment works.

## Outputs, quality assurance, and data value
- Outputs intended as clear formats like reports, maps, and charts to communicate environmental condition and policy performance over time.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals, aligning with standard environmental monitoring practices.
- QA framework includes instrument calibration, QC samples, certified reference materials, and regular proficiency testing, supporting data reliability for long-term monitoring.
- Acknowledges broader challenges and opportunities:
  - Increasing the value of datasets by integrating them with other data sources.
  - Ensuring broad access to underlying data to enable reuse and scrutiny.

## Key points for analysts monitoring environmental health
- A comprehensive, multi-site approach across rural to urban gradients in two major NW England basins.
- Standardized, repeatable sampling and advanced laboratory analyses to characterize major, minor, and trace elements, nutrients, and organic matter.
- Integration of hydrological context (flow regimes and reservoir effects) to interpret concentrations and loadings.
- Strong emphasis on data quality, traceability, and accessibility to support ongoing environmental assessment and policy evaluation.
