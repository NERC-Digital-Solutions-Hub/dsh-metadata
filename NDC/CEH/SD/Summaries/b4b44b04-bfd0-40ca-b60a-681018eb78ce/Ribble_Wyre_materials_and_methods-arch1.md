# The Ribble/Wyre observatory: Major, minor and trace elements in rivers draining from rural headwaters to the heartlands of the NW England historic industrial base

- Scope and purpose
  - Longitudinal study of major, minor, and trace elements in rivers draining rural headwaters to industrial heartlands in NW England (Ribble and Wyre basins).
  - Aimed at identifying natural versus anthropogenic controls on water quality and informing models of transport and impact.

- Study area
  - Ribble basin: includes upland acid moorland to urban/industrial lower reaches; conurbations around Calder, Darwen, Douglas; main tributaries include Hodder.
  - Wyre basin: moorland upper region with low population density and lowland agricultural input; Garstang sits on the main stem.
  - Geology and soils: predominantly Carboniferous rocks; soils mainly deep loams with peat components; presence of Triassic sandstones in lower parts.
  - Hydrology: highly variable flow regimes; highest flows in Ribble and Calder; reservoirs influence residence times in some tributaries.

- Monitoring design
  - 26 sites selected after basin-wide assessment using GIS/field data (geology, relief, agriculture, point sources, population).
  - Catchments span rural, agricultural, and urban/industrial settings; septic tanks and significant sewage treatment works present.
  - Population and point sources identified as key controls on water quality; flow regimes range from upland flashy to groundwater-dominated lowlands.

- Site layout by river system
  - Main Ribble stem: R4 (Gisburn, upper), R5 (Great Mitton, mid), R7 (Ribchester, lower).
  - Ribble tributaries: Hodder (R1 Dunsop; R2 Loud; R3 lower Hodder); Calder (C1 Pendle Water Barrowford; C2 Colne Barrowford; C3 Altham Bridge; C4 Hyndburn Brook; C5 Whalley); Douglas (D1 Yarrow; D2 Adlington; D3 Standish; D4 Parbold; D5 Tawd at Hoscar; D6 Eller Brook; D7 Grimshaw Green); Darwen (R8 Roach Bridge).
  - Wyre system: W1 Tarnbrook Wyre; W2 Marshaw Wyre; W3 Wyre Abbeystead Weir; W4 Wyre Garstang Bridge; W5 Calderbridge; W6 Brock at Bilborough; W7 Wyre St Michaels.

- Sampling and analysis
  - Sampling frequency: fortnightly for the first year (from 18 February 2008), monthly thereafter.
  - Sample collection: at bridges using weighted polypropylene samplers; in-field measurements include water temperature, weather, and water height.
  - Analytes and measurements: major solutes; pH; Gran alkalinity; trace metals (including Al and high Fe); mercury; chlorophyll; suspended sediment; conductivity; absorbance at 340 nm (DOC proxy); SRP; NH4-N; total dissolved phosphorus (TDP); dissolved hydrolysable phosphorus (DHP); total Hg (T-Hg); major cations and anions; dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN); organic nitrogen inferred from TDN minus inorganic N.
  - Laboratory methods: acidification and preservation protocols; filtration and digestion steps; ICP-MS (trace metals), ICP-OES (major elements), IC (anions), TOC analyser (DOC/TDN), colorimetric methods for nutrients, CVF for Hg, QA/QC with standards and proficiency testing; ISO 17025–accredited methods where possible.
  - Data processing: flow-adjusted concentrations computed using low and high flow percentiles (bottom/top 10%) from Environment Agency gauging data; EpCO2 calculated from pH and Gran alkalinity; recognition that dissolved datasets include colloidal contributions.
  - Data handling notes: non-detect values not rounded or capped to avoid artefacts; filtering artefacts acknowledged; careful management of potential measurement artefacts from colloids and sample handling.

- Data quality and interpretation
  - Calibration and QA: batch-based calibration with standards; internal QC samples; certified reference materials; proficiency testing (Aquacheck); most analyses conducted under ISO 17025 accreditation.
  - Data interpretation considerations: dissolved metal fractions may include colloids; previous work indicates significant colloidal-bound metals in similar rivers; potential influences of residence time and upstream inputs on observed concentrations.

- Relevance for analysis
  - The dataset supports exploring correlations between land use, population density, wastewater inputs, flow regime, and water quality (major ions, nutrients, metals, carbon species).
  - Enables development of predictive models for transport and fate of nutrients and metals under varying hydrological conditions (low vs high flow).
  - Provides a framework for assessing anthropogenic versus natural controls and for informing environmental management decisions.

- References and context
  - Incorporates methodological and interpretive guidance from prior work on filtration artefacts, colloidal metals, alkalinity and EpCO2 calculations, and standard QA practices in environmental analysis.
