# The Ribble/Wyre observatory: Major, minor and trace elements in rivers draining from rural headwaters to the heartlands of the NW England historic industrial base

## Overview
- A study of major, minor, and trace elements in rivers draining from rural headwaters to industrial heartlands in NW England, focusing on the Ribble and Wyre basins.
- Examines how land use (rural, agricultural, urban/industrial) and population influence water quality and element fluxes.
- Establishes an extensive, long-term monitoring framework across a range of catchments and hydrological conditions.

## Basins and catchment characteristics
- Ribble Basin areas: 1133 km2 (Ribble), 231 km2 (Douglas), 136 km2 (Darwen), 314 km2 (Wyre).
- Geology and soils: predominantly Carboniferous rocks; lower Wyre with Triassic sandstones; soils include deep loams, peat, and peaty loams.
- Land use gradient: upland acid moorland to rural grassland and intensive dairy farming; urban/industrial conurbations in lower Ribble and Calder areas.
- Hydrology: highly variable flow regimes from wet upland rivers to groundwater-dominated lowland streams; significant reservoirs and sewage treatment works influence flow and sediment dynamics.
- Human influence: population and sewage infrastructure (STWs, septic tanks) are key controls on water quality across catchments.

## Monitoring design and site selection
- Basin-wide assessment used GIS, geology, relief, agriculture, point sources, and population to select 26 monitoring sites.
- Catchments cover rural, agricultural, and urban/industrial settings; monitoring accounts for significant STWs and rural septic inputs.
- Aims to capture flow variability and sewage/industrial influence on water quality across scales.

## Site descriptions and river coverage
- Main stem sites representing upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Ribble.
- Ribble tributaries monitored: Hodder (rural signal), Calder (urban/industrial signal), Darwen, Douglas (industrial/agricultural mix).
- Hodder: three sites along upland to lower reach.
- Calder: five sites along rural to urban/industrial gradient.
- Douglas: seven sites spanning upper moorland to tidal reach (including tributaries and main-stem).
- Darwen: single site near tidal limit of non-tidal stretch.
- Wyre: seven sites along upland to lowland sequence, including confluences with Calder and Brock near Garstang.

## Sampling and analysis methodology
- Sampling frequency: fortnightly for the first year (from Feb 18, 2008), then monthly.
- Field sampling: water collected at bridges with weighted samplers; in-field measurements included water temperature, weather, and height.
- Analyte suite: major solutes, pH, Gran alkalinity; trace metals (Al, Fe, and others), mercury; chlorophyll; suspended sediment.
- Sample handling: unfiltered and filtered portions preserved; metals samples acidified; mercury fixed with HCl; protection from contamination during transport.
- Laboratory analyses: 
  - pH, conductivity, alkalinity by standard titration and conductometry.
  - DOC (absorbance at 340 nm) and TDN via TOC-chemistry with chemiluminescence for nitrogen.
  - SRP and ammonium by colorimetric methods; TDP after autoclave oxidation (persulphate) to quantify all dissolved phosphorus forms; DHP estimated as difference between TDP and SRP.
  - Mercury determined by cold-vapour fluorescence after digestion.
  - Major cations and anions by ICP-OES and ion chromatography, respectively.
  - Trace metals by ICP-MS, with both dissolved and total fractions considered (acknowledging colloidal contributions).
- Quality control and accreditation:
  - Instruments calibrated with standards; samples reanalyzed if exceeding calibration range.
  - QC with internal standards, certified references, and proficiency testing; methods largely ISO 17025 accredited.
- Data handling and interpretation:
  - Flow-based concentration estimation using Environment Agency gauging data to derive low-flow and high-flow averages (top/bottom 10% flows).
  - EpCO2 (excess partial pressure of CO2) calculated from pH and Gran alkalinity to assess carbon dynamics relative to atmospheric equilibrium.
  - Care taken not to round or omit values below detection to minimize artefacts in averaging.
  - Acknowledgement that “dissolved” metal fractions may include colloidal material; efforts made to avoid filtration artefacts.

## Data relevance for data leadership and system thinking
- Demonstrates comprehensive, multi-site data collection across a spectrum of land uses, aligning with the Data Leaders emphasis on understanding the whole data system and user needs.
- Reflects need for clear metadata, standardized methods, and QA/QC to ensure data discoverability, comparability, and usability for policy colleagues and partners.
- Highlights challenges of integrating disparate data sources (urban, rural, industrial inputs) and accounting for temporal variability and flow conditions in deriving meaningful indicators.

## Key considerations and takeaways
- Population and sewage infrastructure are major controls on water quality across large basins.
- Urban/industrial inputs markedly affect certain tributaries (e.g., Calder), while upland moorland signals persist in rural tributaries (e.g., Hodder, Yarrow).
- The study emphasizes the importance of robust, standardized analytical methods, careful sample handling, and accreditation to ensure data quality across long-term monitoring.
- Flow-contextualized interpretation (low vs. high flow) is essential for accurately assessing concentrations and environmental impact.
