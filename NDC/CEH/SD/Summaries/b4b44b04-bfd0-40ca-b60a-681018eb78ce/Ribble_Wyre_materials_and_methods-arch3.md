# The Ribble/Wyre observatory: Major, minor and trace elements in rivers draining from rural headwaters to the heartlands of the NW England historic industrial base

- Purpose and context
  - Establishes a basin-wide observatory in the Ribble and Wyre basins to monitor major, minor, and trace elements across rural, agricultural, and urban/industrial influences.
  - Aims to inform environmental health assessments to scrutinise policy, evaluate decisions, and guide future management.

- Monitoring framework and site selection
  - 26 monitoring sites chosen to span rural upland, agricultural, and urban/industrial settings, including main stems and key tributaries (Hodder, Calder, Douglas, Darwen) and the Wyre.
  - Site selection driven by GIS data on geology, relief, land use, point sources (sewage works, septic tanks), and population; catchments cover diverse flow regimes (upland flashy vs. groundwater-dominated lowland).
  - Represented inputs from significant sewage treatment works and rural septic systems; downstream inputs reflect urban/industrial activity and reservoir influences.

- Descriptions of monitoring components and river segments
  - Main stem: upper, middle, and lower Ribble (R4, R5, R7) capturing rural headwaters to tidal estuary influences.
  - Tributaries: Hodder (rural signal), Calder (urban/industrial influence with converging inputs), Douglas (industrial/agricultural mix), and Darwen (industrial towns to estuary).
  - Wyre: upland tributaries (Tarnbrook Wyre, Marshaw Wyre) and lowland sections leading to Garstang and the estuary, with multiple monitoring points along main stem and tributaries.

- Sampling and analysis program
  - Sampling frequency: fortnightly for the first year (starting Feb 18, 2008), then monthly.
  - In-field measurements: water temperature, weather, water height; samples collected from bridges using calibrated samplers.
  - Laboratory analyses: broad suite including pH, Gran alkalinity, conductivity; major cations/anions; dissolved and particulate trace metals (ICP-MS, ICP-OES); mercury (cold-vapour fluorescence); DOC and TDN; SRP, NH4-N; TDP and DHP; chlorophyll; BDOC proxies; and absorbance at 340 nm.
  - Special handling: filtered/unfiltered fractions for metals; strict contamination controls for trace metals and mercury; samples stored in cool, dark conditions; prompt analysis or preserved samples to minimize deterioration.
  - Data quality and validation: instrument calibration with standards; use of internal QC samples, certified reference materials, and proficiency testing; ISO 17025-aligned methods where applicable.
  - Flow context: concentration estimates adjusted using Environment Agency gauging data to reflect low/high-flow conditions (bottom/top 10% flows); where gauges were unavailable, surrogate gauges used.

- Data interpretation and methodological notes
  - Excess CO2 partial pressures (EpCO2) derived from pH and Gran alkalinity to assess carbonate chemistry dynamics.
  - Acknowledges limitations in distinguishing truly dissolved vs colloidal metal fractions; notes that filtration does not fully separate these fractions and that colloidal-associated metals can be significant.
  - Non-detects were handled without rounding or substitution to avoid artefacts in averages; data interpretation emphasizes hydrological controls and transport processes.

- Implications for monitoring framework design
  - Demonstrates the value of a basin-scale, gradient-spanning monitoring design to detect impacts from rural to urban/industrial activities.
  - Highlights the importance of a comprehensive analytical suite to capture chemical, nutrient, and carbon dynamics across diverse catchments.
  - Emphasizes rigorous QA/QC, data governance considerations, and transparent documentation to support policy scrutiny and decision-making.

- Relevance to policy and governance
  - Provides a framework for assessing how urbanization, wastewater inputs, and agricultural practices influence water chemistry from headwaters to estuaries.
  - The approach supports evidence-based management of nutrient loads, metal contamination, and broader river ecosystem health, while acknowledging data interpretation challenges and the need for accessible, well-documented datasets.
