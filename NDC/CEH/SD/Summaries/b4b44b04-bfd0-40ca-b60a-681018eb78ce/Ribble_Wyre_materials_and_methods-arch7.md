# The Ribble/Wyre observatory: Major, minor and trace elements in rivers draining from rural headwaters to the heartlands of the NW England historic industrial base

- Objective and scope
  - Establish a basin-wide observatory to measure major, minor, and trace elements in rivers draining rural headwaters to NW England’s historic industrial heartlands.
  - Integrates field surveys, GIS data, and comprehensive chemical analyses to understand spatial and temporal patterns in water quality.

- Study area: The Ribble and Wyre Basins
  - Two primary NW England basins studied: Ribble (incl. Douglas and Darwen) and Wyre, with areas of 1133, 231, 136, and 314 km² respectively.
  - Descriptions include diverse land uses: upland acid moorland, rural/village areas, and urban/industrial conurbations (e.g., Burnley, Blackburn, Wigan, Garstang).
  - Geology mainly Carboniferous rocks; lower Wyre and western Ribble edge show Triassic sandstones and minor Permian mudstones.
  - Hydrological regime spans wet upland flush flows to groundwater-dominated lowlands; reservoirs influence siltation and water chemistry.

- Monitoring network and site selection
  - 26 sites selected after basin-wide assessment using field data and GIS layers (geology, relief, agriculture, point sources, population).
  - Catchments cover a range of rural, agricultural, and urban/industrial settings; septic tanks and STWs are significant inputs.
  - Use of FEH CD-ROM v3.0 for catchment area and mean altitude statistics.
  - Sampling sites categorized by river system: main stem, Ribble tributaries, Hodder, Calder, Douglas, Darwen, and Wyre, with representative upper/mid/lower reach points and urban/industrial inputs.

- Site-by-site overview (representative examples)
  - Main stem: R4 Gisburn (upper Ribble), R5 Great Mitton (mid Ribble), R7 Ribchester (lower Ribble, near estuary).
  - Hodder: R1 Dunsop Bridge, R2 Loud, R3 lower Hodder (R1–R3 capture upland to downstream signals).
  - Calder: C1 Pendle Water at Barrowford, C2 Colne at Barrowford, C3 Calder at Altham Bridge, C4 Hyndburn Brook, C5/R6 Calder at Whalley.
  - Douglas: D1 Yarrow, D2 Adlington, D3 Standish, D4 Parbold, D5 Tawd at Hoscar, D6 Eller Brook, D7 Douglas at Grimshaw Green.
  - Darwen: R8 Roach Bridge (lower non-tidal Ribble estuary).
  - Wyre: W1 Tarnbrook Wyre, W2 Marshaw Wyre, W3 Wyre at Abbeystead Weir, W4 Wyre at Garstang Bridge, W5 Calder at Calderbridge, W6 Brock at Bilsborough, W7 Wyre at St Michaels.
  - Overall, sites span upland moorland to lowland agricultural and urbanized zones, including tidal influences.

- Sampling and analysis
  - Sampling frequency: fortnightly in year 1 (from 18 Feb 2008), then monthly.
  - Sample collection and in-field measurements: water temperature, weather/field conditions, water height.
  - Analytes and sample types:
    - Major solutes, pH, Gran alkalinity; trace metals (Al, Fe, etc.); mercury; chlorophyll.
    - Suspended sediment gravimetrically; conductivity.
    - Dissolved/organic carbon analyses (DOC, NPOC); total dissolved nitrogen (TDN); organic N; nutrients (SRP, NH4-N, TDP, DHP).
    - Major cations/anions (via ICP-OES and ion chromatography); dissolved and total Hg (via ICP-MS and CVF).
  - Filtration and handling: filtered/unfiltered aliquots prepared and stored to minimize degradation; steps taken to avoid contamination.
  - Instrumentation and QA: analyses performed with calibrated ICP-OES/MS, IC, TOC, and spectrophotometric methods; QA includes internal QC, certified reference materials, and proficiency testing; ISO 17025 accreditation emphasis.

- Data treatment and flow context
  - Flow context: site concentrations adjusted using Environment Agency gauging data to reflect low-flow and high-flow conditions; top/bottom 10% flow subsets used to estimate representative concentrations.
  - Excess partial pressures of CO2 (EpCO2) calculated from pH and Gran alkalinity, enabling interpretation of carbon dynamics.
  - Handling of non-detects: values below detection were not rounded or substituted to avoid artefacts in averages.
  - Acknowledges complexity of dissolved metals, where filtration may include colloidal forms; notes that metals can be partly colloidal/particulate in rivers.

- GIS and data products implications
  - The dataset supports map-based visualizations of spatial patterns in major/minor/trace elements across catchments with distinct urban, agricultural, and rural signals.
  - Spatial layers include site locations, catchment boundaries, hydrological flows, land use, and inputs from point sources (STWs) to support GIS-driven analyses.
  Potential products:
  - Spatial maps of element concentrations by site and over time (with flow-adjusted metrics).
  - Links to land use, population density, and point-source inputs to explore drivers of water quality.
  - Temporal trend maps highlighting seasonal and flow-related variability.

- Limitations and data quality considerations
  - Distinction between truly dissolved vs. colloidal metal forms; filtration artefacts and potential underestimation of dissolved metals discussed.
  - Some sites lack nearby gauging data, requiring surrogate flow estimates; high inter-site flow correlations support method, but uncertainties remain.
  - Data interpretation acknowledges complex hydrology (upland vs. lowland, reservoir influences, diurnal/seasonal changes).

- References and methodology validation
  - Cited methodological references cover filtration artefacts, standardization of alkalinity measurements, titanium in rivers, and interrelationships of trace elements, underpinning analytical approaches and QA practices.
