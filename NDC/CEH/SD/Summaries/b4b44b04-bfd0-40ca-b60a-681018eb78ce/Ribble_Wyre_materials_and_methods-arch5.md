# The Ribble/Wyre observatory: Major, minor and trace elements in rivers draining from rural headwaters to the heartlands of the NW England historic industrial base.

## Overview
- Large-scale river monitoring program in the Ribble and Wyre basins in northwest England.
- Aims to quantify major, minor, and trace elements across rural headwaters to industrially influenced systems.
- 26 monitoring sites selected to capture diverse catchment settings (rural, agricultural, urban/industrial).

## Study Area and Basins
- Ribble Basin: includes upper rural moorland and lower urban/industrial conurbations; tributaries include Hodder, Calder, Darwen, Douglas.
- Wyre Basin: largely rural upland moorland with a low-population lowland area and one market town; main stem and several tributaries monitored.
- Geology and soils described (carboniferous rocks; Triassic sandstones; peat and various loams) with transitions from upland to lowland environments.

## Monitoring Design
- Basin-wide assessment conducted using field surveys and GIS (geology, relief, agriculture, point sources, population).
- Catchment areas estimated with FEH CD-ROM v.3.0.
- 26 sites cover a range of hydrological regimes (upland flashy rivers to groundwater-dominated lowlands) and significant sewage treatment works and septic tank inputs.

## Site Categorisation and Selection
- Main stem monitoring at three reach points representing upper, middle, and lower river sections (R4, R5, R7).
- Ribble tributaries: Hodder (rural and rural-urban signals) with three sites (R1, R2, R3) and immediate downstream signal to Ribble.
- Calder: urban/industrial influence with multiple points (C1–C5; includes Barrowford, Colne, Altham Bridge, Hyndburn Brook, Whalley).
- Douglas: seven sites (D1–D7) spanning upland to tidal influence, with varied industrial and agricultural inputs.
- Darwen: single monitoring point near tidal Ribble estuary (R8) capturing urban-industrial influence.
- Wyre: seven sites (W1–W7) from upland moorland to non-tidal downstream limits, including Abbeystead, Garstang, and Garstang inputs.

## Sampling and Analysis
- Sampling frequency: fortnightly for the first year (from 18 February 2008), monthly thereafter.
- Field methods: sampling at bridges using weighted bottles; in-field temperature, weather, and water height notes.
- Analytes collected: major solutes, pH, Gran alkalinity; trace metals (Al, Fe, other metals), mercury; chlorophyll; dissolved and particulate fractions considered.
- Sample handling: dark storage at ~4°C; filtration of samples in the lab; acidification of sub-samples for metals; preservation steps to minimize deterioration.
- Laboratory analyses and instruments: 
  - ICP-OES (ICP opt. emission spectrometry) for major cations/anions.
  - ICP-MS for trace metals.
  - IC (ion chromatography) for Cl−, NO3−, SO4^2−.
  - UV-Vis spectrophotometry for DOC absorbance at 340 nm.
  - TOC analyzer for dissolved organic carbon and TDN (with pre-acidification and autosampler processing).
  - Fluorometric mercury determination after digestion.
  - Phosphorus analyses: SRP, TDP, DHP via autoclave digestion with persulphate oxidant for breakdown of dissolved organic forms.
- Data derivations: dissolved and particulate fractions noted; org-N calculated as TDN minus inorganic N (NH4+ NO3−).
- Flow context: site concentrations contextualized using Environment Agency gauging data to estimate low- and high-flow condition means; some sites used nearest gauges as surrogates when gauges absent.
- EpCO2: calculated from pH and Gran alkalinity to assess carbon dioxide partial pressures relative to atmospheric equilibrium.

## Quality Assurance and Data Integrity
- Calibration against standard solutions; top-standard dilution for values above calibration range.
- Validation through internal QC samples, certified reference materials, and regular proficiency samples (Aquacheck Ltd).
- Methods aligned with ISO 17025 accreditation where applicable.
- Acknowledgement that “dissolved” metals may include colloidal material; efforts made to avoid filtration artefacts by preventing filter overload.

## Data Context and Considerations for Use
- Data provide comprehensive chemical profiles across rural, agricultural, and urban/industrial catchments, enabling investigation of point sources, land-use effects, and hydrological controls on water quality.
- Some sites lack direct flow gauges; surrogate gauges used; flow relationships observed as strongly correlated between sites.
- Emphasis on differentiating rural upland signals from urban/industrial influences through multi-site, longitudinal measurements.
- Data include both inorganic and organic water quality parameters, with derived metrics such as DHP and EpCO2 to support integrated biogeochemical analyses.
