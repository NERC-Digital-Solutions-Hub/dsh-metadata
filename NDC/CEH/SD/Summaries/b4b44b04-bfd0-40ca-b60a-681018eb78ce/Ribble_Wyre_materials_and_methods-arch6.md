# The Ribble/Wyre observatory: Major, minor and trace elements in rivers draining from rural headwaters to the heartlands of the NW England historic industrial base

## Overview
- Large-scale study of major, minor, and trace elements in rivers across the Ribble and Wyre basins in NW England, linking rural headwaters to urban/industrial heartlands.
- Aims to understand how geology, land use, population, and effluent inputs shape water chemistry and sediment dynamics.

## Monitoring network and catchments
- Basin-wide assessment identified 26 monitoring sites across diverse settings (rural, agricultural, urban/industrial).
- Catchments surveyed for geology, relief, agriculture, septic and wastewater inputs, and population; flow regimes range from flashy upland streams to groundwater-dominated lowland rivers.
- Site groupings:
  - Main stem: three sites (R4 Gisburn, R5 Great Mitton, R7 Ribchester) representing upper, mid, lower reaches.
  - Ribble tributaries: Hodder (R1–R3), Calder (C1–C5, plus C6 in Wyre context), Darwen (R8), Douglas (D1–D7).
  - Wyre: seven sites (W1–W7) spanning upland to lowland with synergies around Garstang and downstream confluence.
- Use of FEH CD-ROM v.3.0 to estimate catchment areas and mean altitude; exploration of sewage works and septic inputs as major influences in rural areas.

## Sampling and analyzed parameters
- Sampling cadence: fortnightly for the first year, then monthly; sampling from bridges with a weighted sampler.
- Data collected:
  - Major solutes, pH, Gran alkalinity
  - Trace metals (including Al, Fe) at higher concentrations
  - Mercury, chlorophyll
  - Suspended sediment (gravimetric)
  - Dissolved and total phosphorus species (SRP, TDP, DHP)
  - Ammonium-N (NH4-N)
  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Total Dissolved Nitrogen (TDN)
  - Organic N (org-N derived from TDN minus inorganic N)
  - Major cations/anions (e.g., Cl, NO3, SO4) via ICPOES and IC
  - Titanium studied for colloidal/particulate forms
  - Dissolved and total Hg using cold-vapour fluorescence
- Sample handling: cold storage (~4°C); filtration for many analyses; acidification of metals samples; protection of metals/mercury bottles from contamination; SRP measured same day to avoid deterioration.

## Analytical methods and QA/QC
- Instruments:
  - ICP-OES for major elements
  - ICP-MS for trace metals
  - IC for major anions
  - TOC analyzer for DOC and TDN; chemiluminescence for TDN
  - Cold-vapour fluorescence for mercury
- Quality assurance:
  - Regular calibration with standard solutions
  - Reanalysis of samples above calibration range
  - Use of internal QC materials, certified references, and proficiency testing (Aquacheck)
  - ISO 17025 accreditation alignment
- Data treatment specifics:
  - Excess partial pressures of CO2 (EpCO2) computed from pH and Gran alkalinity
  - Flows used to estimate low/high concentration scenarios: using Environment Agency gauging data; bottom/top 10% flow subsets
  - For some sites without gauges, nearest available gauge used as surrogate
  - Acknowledgement that many measured “dissolved” metals include colloidal fractions; filtration performed carefully to minimize artefacts
  - Detection-level non-detects not rounded or substituted to avoid artefacts in averages

## Data treatment and interpretation
- Data processed to relate river chemistry to catchment characteristics, land use, and population pressures, including urban/industrial inputs and septic/treatment works.
- Distinctions made between upland/moorland signals and lower-river signals influenced by urbanization and industry.
- Consideration of in-river processes and retention, highlighted by the focus on Ti and colloidal phases and the potential for significant within-river retention.

## Data challenges and considerations
- Time required to fully understand the “ask” in broader data contexts (integration with other datasets and stakeholders).
- Handling patchy or heterogeneous data formats across sites and methods.
- Accessing data from multiple systems (catchment, treatment works, flow gauges) and reconciling differences.
- Communicating complex, multivariate chemistry in actionable forms.
- Ensuring outputs are widely shared and reused; promoting outputs to maximize impact.

## Outputs and potential data products
- Comprehensive baseline dataset across 26 sites and multiple determinands spanning rural to urban-influenced environments.
- Potential for dashboards and self-serve reports enabling exploration of spatial and temporal trends in major/minor/trace elements, nutrients, and organic matter.
- Data can support assessments of anthropogenic impact, nutrient cycling, sediment dynamics, and the effectiveness of wastewater and land-use management.
- Framework supports linking water chemistry to catchment attributes (area, altitude, population, sewage inputs) for policy and management applications.
