# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The Countryside Survey sampling framework is a long-running effort to obtain representative ecological data for Great Britain by using an environmental stratification system called the ITE Land Classification (ILC).
- It relies on stratified random sampling to ensure national, regional, and country-level estimates of habitats and land-use features are robust and comparably derived across surveys.

## Core concepts and approach

- Stratification: Land is divided into discrete strata (land classes) so sampling covers the full range of ecological conditions.
- ITE Land Classification (ILC): A multivariate system that groups land by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.). Originated in the 1970s with 32 classes; expanded over time (40, then 45+ classes) to improve representativeness and enable country-specific reporting.
- Sampling units: 1 km square units were chosen as the basic field-sampling unit; for each central square, four surrounding squares are also allocated for classification and sampling.
- Data handling: Classifications are linked to mapped environmental data; results are presented as national estimates derived from mean habitat areas per square times the land class area, with ongoing attention to data provenance and metadata.

## Historical development and key surveys

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
  - 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid) classified; 1228 centre squares (plus surrounding squares) used for classification.
  - 256 squares surveyed (8 per land class) to establish national habitat area estimates.
  - Output: early national estimates and maps describing land classes (Table 1; Figure 1).

- 1984 – Second GB survey
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (384 total), including eight previously visited squares.
  - National estimates still referenced the 1978 Land Classification framework.

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to cover all GB squares (All Squares approach); urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of the 1978-1984 features; first Land Cover Map linked to the program.
  - Results published in CS1990 main report.

- 1998–2000 – Revisions for regional detail and Scotland reporting (CS2000)
  - Land Classification extended to classify every GB square; 40 land classes retained but with updated surrogates for climate/geology/physiography.
  - Separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) introduced to improve country-specific policy relevance.
  - Framework adjustments included subdividing classes for country units, aggregating small rump classes, and adding 19 extra squares to ensure new classes are represented, plus 11 more to balance England and Wales.
  - Uplands module added (30 additional squares) to improve accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - Summary tables/maps (Table 2; Figure 5) document the distribution and sampling rates.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) and Wales-focused reporting
  - Wales-specific reporting needs driven by devolution; Wales required more dedicated sampling to support Wales-only estimates.
  - ILC subdivided into country-unit versions (5 new Welsh-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), increasing strata to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares; England did not receive additional Welsh squares, though two English classes (5e, 15e) have only 4 squares each.
  - Revised maps (England/Wales/Scotland) and detailed tables (Table 3) show the 2007 sampling framework and counts (and 2000 comparisons).
  - Wales and upland sampling adjustments improved precision for country-specific habitat estimates.

## Data structure, outputs, and comparability

- National estimates: Derived from mean habitat area per square within each land class multiplied by the land class area; changes in classification impact cross-survey comparability.
- Consistency guidance: Where possible, national estimates favor the latest Land Classification to reflect current understanding, while presenting cross-survey consistency considerations (see Note Regarding the Creation of National Estimates).
- Tables and figures: The document provides detailed tables of square counts by class and country (Tables 1–4 in various sections) and maps illustrating the Land Classification and sample squares (Figures 1–7).

## Country-specific and upland considerations

- England, Scotland, Wales
  - CS1990–CS2000 adjustments introduced separate country estimates by subdividing land classes into country-unit versions and increasing sample representation per country.
  - Wales required additional Welsh-specific classes and more Welsh sample squares (leading to Wales being the most intensively sampled of the three).
- Uplands module
  - An extra sampling module in CS2000 added 30 upland squares to better estimate upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Practical implications for analysts

- The sampling strategy provides a robust framework for detecting change over time and for generating country-specific environmental statistics, while balancing geographic coverage with the practical limits of fieldwork.
- Analysts should be mindful of classification changes when comparing national estimates across surveys; documentation advocates using the latest classification for current estimates but notes cross-class comparability challenges.
- The approach emphasizes traceability (documented history of classifications, sampling frame changes, and country-specific adjustments) and data discoverability (maps and tables detailing classifications and sampling).
