# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Documents the evolution of the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) field surveys, tying current methodology to 30 years of development of the ITE Land Classification.
  - Aims to provide representative, change-detectable estimates of habitat and landscape features across Great Britain, enabling policy-relevant insights and regional/country-level reporting.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to avoid bias by dividing GB into discreet strata (Land Classes) based on environmental attributes.
  - ITE Land Classification: a hierarchical system created from environmental variables (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to stratify the landscape.
  - Sample unit: initially a 1 km square; classification applied to squares, with surrounding squares assigned using the ISA-based key.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used historically to form and describe land classes; later classifications refined with expanding data and computing power.

- Timeline of key developments
  - 1978 (CS1978)
    - First GB field survey using a 1 km square sampling framework.
    - 32 Land Classes; eight samples per class; total 256 squares surveyed.
    - Estimates of habitat areas: derived from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class times the total area of that class.
  - 1984 (CS1984)
    - Second field survey; 12 km squares per class; total 384 squares.
    - Used the original 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (CS1990)
    - All GB squares reclassified into a revised Land Classification to cover the full GB grid.
    - 508 squares surveyed; added repeat quadrats and land-use data; aligned with the first Land Cover Map of GB.
    - National estimates based on the 1990 Land Classification; set the stage for regional/local reporting.
  - 1998 / CS2000 planning
    - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to support Scotland reporting; began addressing country-specific estimates.
    - CS2000 introduced separate country-unit estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) and required adjustments to sampling to maintain representation.
    - Additional sampling: 19 more squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; further adjustments to maintain even sampling across countries.
    - An uplands module was added to improve accuracy for upland habitats.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-focused reporting needs led to sub-dividing Land Classes into country-unit versions (creating five new Welsh sub-classes) and increasing the Wales sample.
    - Wales gained a total of 43 additional squares; England adjustments were made to maintain overall precision.
    - Final framework included 45 strata (increasing from 40) with Wales receiving enhanced representation; total sampled squares for GB (England & Wales) rose to 569 (CS2000) and 591 (CS2007).
    - Wales-only sampling intensified to support Wales-specific environmental policy and legislation reporting.

- Numbers and coverage at a glance
  - Sample squares (GB total by survey)
    - CS1978: 256
    - CS1984: 384
    - CS1990: 508
    - CS2000: 569
    - CS2007: 591
  - Land Classes
    - 1978: 32 classes; stratified sampling across GB.
    - 1990: Land Classification expanded; all GB squares classified; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
    - 1998/2000: classes expanded to 40 (with separate Scotland reporting); preparation for country-unit estimates.
    - 2000/2007: further subdivisions to support England with Wales and Scotland country-unit reporting; total strata adjusted to 40→45.
  - Country-unit reporting
    - England with Wales and Scotland reporting introduced to improve country-specific environmental policy support.
    - Wales-specific adjustments required additional Welsh squares and Welsh sub-classes.
  - Uplands module
    - An extra sampling module added to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.

- Method for national estimates
  - Early method: mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - With classification updates: national estimates aligned to the latest Land Classification, while “country-unit” estimates use squares within the respective country.
  - Note on consistency: changing the underlying Land Classification affects cross-survey comparability; the report discusses balancing consistency with the need for country-specific classification alignment.

- Wales, Scotland, and uplands considerations
  - Wales-only reporting requirements drove sub-classification and increased Welsh sampling in 2007.
  - Scotland reporting had been established earlier; subsequent changes ensured Scotland-specific estimates remained robust.
  - An uplands module (30 additional squares) was added to bolster statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

- Additional context and references
  - The document includes a historical appendix outlining the development of the ITE Land Classification and its applications across CS2000 and CS2007.
  - Acknowledges methodological guidance and statistical input to support robust, policy-relevant outcomes.

- Outputs and implications for data use
  - Produces a set of habitat and landscape estimates at national and country-unit levels, enabling trend analysis and policy assessment.
  - Supports self-contained, country-specific reporting frameworks (especially for Wales and Scotland) while maintaining a coherent national methodology.
  - The evolving sampling framework reflects balancing data richness, representativeness, and the practicalities of cross-country environmental monitoring.
