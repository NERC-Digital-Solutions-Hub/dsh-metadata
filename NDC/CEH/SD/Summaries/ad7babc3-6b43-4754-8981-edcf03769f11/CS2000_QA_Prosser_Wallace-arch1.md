COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Aim and scope
- Objective: quantify accuracy and reliability of CS2000 field recording and mapping, assess plot relocation efficiency, evaluate concordance with QA assessments, analyze potential observer bias, and relate findings to CS1990.
- Scope: QA on a subsample (38 of 519 squares in 1998), resurvey of one quarter per square (234 species plots across nine plot types), plus landcover and boundary mapping, and change detection.

## Methods (how the QA was conducted)
- Sampling and re-survey
  - 38 squares selected; in each, one quarter resurveyed.
  - 234 plots analyzed from different plot types; markers, sketch maps, photos, and metal detectors used to relocate plots and buried plates.
  - Plate/plot relocation categorized into four performance groups and compared against 1990 CS locations.
- Measurements and comparisons
  - Species records: concordance (presence/absence) and percent cover estimates compared between CS2000 and QA.
  - Landcover mapping: comparison of primary codes, secondary landcover codes, and boundary codes; assessment of changes since 1990.
  - Hedge diversity and arable margins: evaluation of hedge plots and arable plots for species and change recording.
  - Change analysis: evaluation of how well changes since 1990 were recorded and interpreted.
- Annex B includes dates and efficiency measures; primary methods rely on field-based codes and subsequent QA assessment.

## Key findings

### Plot relocation and plate recovery
- Relocation success
  - For CS2000 (210 plots): 60% relocated accurately; ~25% relocated approximately; ~15% not adequately relocated.
  - Overall plate/plot recovery: 69.3% of plates located; 23.3% of 1990 plates recovered; 40-45% could be considered near-correct relocations when counting multiple categories.
  - 8-year relocation feasibility: relocation eight years on is about as feasible as after 12 months, but the process yielded some systematic misplacements (e.g., wrong bank/side of features).
- Implications
  - Plot relocation and plate-mark accuracy are major sources of non-concordance and potential bias in subsequent analyses.

### Species concordance and recording accuracy
- Overall accuracy
  - CS2000 species records: ~73% initially concordant with QA; ~2% non-concordances due to real management/seasonal changes.
  - The QA generally confirmed that 1990 CS survey accuracy was comparable when adjusted for plot relocation issues.
- Change in species lists
  - QA consistently produced longer species lists per plot than the original CS2000 survey (CS2000 v QA increases around 13-14%), similar to prior QA patterns (1991 and 1998 QA exercises showing ~13% rises).
  - The magnitude of increase in QA lists across plot types was broadly consistent with plot-type performance in DECORANA ordination analyses.

### Vegetation cover (percent cover)
- Cover estimates
  - Overall agreement between CS2000 and QA on cover values was good, though several species (notably grasses) showed differences.
  - Specific notable differences (significant in paired tests): Holcus lanatus (p ≈ 0.029), Dactylis glomerata (p ≈ 0.005), Anthoxanthum odoratum (p ≈ 0.040), Eriophorum vaginatum (p ≈ 0.018).
  - For several common grasses, cover disagreements were common but not universally biased toward either method.
- Overall: species-cover concordance about 74.4% when both surveyors and QA recorded the same species at the same location.

### Landcover mapping and boundary coding
- Primary land cover codes
  - High concordance between CS2000 and QA for primary codes: overall agreement about 87.5% (excluding BAP codes).
  - BAP codes showed lower concordance (about 77.4%), reflecting broader habitat-class differences.
- Boundary and land features
  - Primary boundary features: overall concordance around 92% (code concordance about 93%), with some misclassification (e.g., hedges mis-ticked as boundaries, or changes not checked for current presence).
  - Hedge形 and boundary shape: boundary shape codes and hedge codes had moderate concordance (boundary shapes ~67.5%; hedge shape code usage limited success with some omissions).
  - Boundary height and stockproof condition: high efficiency (boundary height ~74%, stockproof ~75%), with overall combined boundary-related concordance around 89-93%.

### Change in land use and land cover
- Change detection
  - Overall change concurrence between CS2000 and QA: about 51.4%.
  - Change not noted by CS2000: ~33.9%.
  - Change recorded but not substantiated by QA: ~14.7%.
  - Conclusion: a substantial proportion of real changes since 1990 may have been missed, and QA suggests cautious interpretation of reported changes without validation from multiple data sources.

### Hedge diversity plots
- Hedge diversity (H plots)
  - QA identified more species in hedge plots than CS2000, with overall total species recorded by QA higher.
  - Total hedge species across 19 samples: 124 species; 74.2% overall agreement; 77.4% surveyor efficiency.
  - Hedge plots showed relatively higher omissions, indicating these features require careful cross-checking.

### Arable plots
- Arable margins
  - Only five arable plots; concordance was very poor.
  - Seasonal differences and limited familiarity with ruderal species contributed to mis-recordings.
  - Recommendation: consider two well-spaced visits for future arable margin plots.

### Overall ordination and bias
- DECORANA axis changes
  - No significant directional bias detected between CS2000 and QA across plot types or landclasses.
  - Some axis-score shifts occurred due to location/orientation or cover mis-matches, but mean axis scores showed no significant difference between CS2000 and QA overall.

## Conclusions and implications for data use
- Overall data quality
  - Major components (plot relocation, landcover mapping, and boundary codes) show substantial reliability and consistency with QA findings.
  - The mapping/landcover and boundary coding generally performed well, with high concordance, while changes over time require cautious interpretation due to partial concordance and potential omissions.
- Key cautions for data users
  - Plot relocation and plate recovery introduce considerable potential for error in time-series analyses; consider adjusting analyses for relocation accuracy and potential mis-location bias.
  - Change detection should be treated with caution; many observed changes may reflect coding or recording discrepancies rather than real landscape change.
  - Arable margins require additional sampling effort to improve reliability.
- Data management and future improvements
  - Permanent marking and more robust relocation protocols improve long-term comparability.
  - Enhanced capture of hedge and boundary details, improved identification aids for grasses and under-recorded species, and systematic checks for seasonal effects would improve QA outcomes.
  - Maintaining metadata on data provenance, surveyors, and QA assessments enhances future re-use and interpretability.
