# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- The document provides detailed methodologies for field data collection, data coding, sampling, photography, GPS data capture, and post-survey data handling within the CS2000 framework.
- It emphasizes standardisation, traceability, and integration with other datasets (e.g., satellite-based land cover) to support national policy objectives and ecological monitoring.

## Plant and Mosses/Lichens Coding System

- Presents extensive abbreviations for plant groups (e.g., Ferns, Forbs/Woody Species, Mosses/Lichens) with mappings to full scientific names.
- Examples show how abbreviations correspond to genus/species (e.g., Athy fil to various ferns, Dryo fil to Dryopteris or other species; numerous species pairings and alternative codes).
- Aimed at consistent field annotation, mosaic coding, and translation between CS codes and broader habitat categories.

## Section 10 – Sampling

- Three types of sampling in CS2000:
  - Soil sampling (field surveyors)
  - Calluna sampling (field surveyors)
  - Freshwater biota sampling (accredited IFE staff)
- Soil sampling purpose:
  - Baseline, nationally distributed soil data for indices of soil biological activity and diversity.
  - Five replicate soil samples per 1 km square, collected from the centre plot (2 x 2 m) of each X-plot.
  - Three cores per sampling location: one long black pipe (15 cm) and two short white pipes (8 cm) to depths >5 cm; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing.
  - Emphasis on rapid processing for short shelf-life samples; precise labeling and packaging.
- Calluna sampling:
  - Collect current year’s growth (CYG) shoots from Calluna vulgaris throughout each square.
  - Target 30–50 g fresh weight; random sampling from multiple Calluna plants.
  - Samples sealed, labeled, and posted to ITE Merlewood; despatching procedures clarified.
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Coordinated with IFE; specialized field surveyors may operate in squares concurrently with CS2000 teams.
- Background goal:
  - Establish baseline soil and biotic data to support long-term soil sustainability assessments and nitrogen deposition studies (Calluna foliar nitrogen focus).

## Section 11 – Photography

- One camera per team; initial stock of films with replenishment claimed via T&S forms.
- Photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and not too distant.
- Each photo must clearly display square and plot numbers on a marker board; framing guidelines provided to ensure informative composition.

## Section 12 – Procedures After Survey

- Post-survey data quality checks:
  - Review data sheets for omissions; avoid ad hoc transposition unless necessary.
- Handling and transport:
  - FABs (Field Assessment Books) and samples should be transported to ITE Stations promptly.
- Emphasis on maintaining data integrity and provenance throughout the handover process.

## Annex 1 – Collecting GPS Data

- Step-by-step guidance for GPS data collection:
  - Battery power checks, satellite availability, PDOP monitoring (aim for PDOP < 6 for good accuracy).
  - Recording stationary positions (plots) and moving features (boundaries) with explicit file naming.
  - Custom file naming: each plot/feature record uses a square-plot identifier (e.g., 501X4.PSE or 501F1.MOB).
  - Sampling rate and logging procedures are specified; how to start/stop logging and interpret time stamps.
- Practical tips:
  - Ensure clear sky view, manage obstructions, and adapt antenna placement if necessary.
  - Use the attribute reference list/sheet to quickly locate plot IDs.
  - Battery charging procedures and almanac updates are described to maintain GPS readiness.

## Attribute Reference Materials

- Includes an attribute reference list and sheet to quickly map coded attributes (e.g., plot IDs, features) to their corresponding CS2000 entries.
- Provides shortcuts for efficiently navigating plot identifiers during data entry.

## Overall Implications for Analysts

- The handbook codifies standardized data capture, labeling, and storage to enable reliable cross-square comparisons and time-series analyses.
- It ensures robust metadata, provenance, and interoperability with satellite-derived land cover data.
- It highlights critical operational considerations: data quality checks, timely shipping of samples, and coordination across institutions (ITE, IFE) for comprehensive environmental monitoring.
