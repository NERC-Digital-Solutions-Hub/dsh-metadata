# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose for GIS specialists
  - Standardizes field data collection to produce GIS-ready, time-series datasets linking ground-truth observations with map outputs.
  - Supports policy-relevant reporting through integrated field data, base maps, theme maps, and habitat classifications.
  - Emphasizes a rigorous, codified workflow that enables spatial analyses across years and scales.

- Data structure, coding, and GIS integration
  - Core data captured in Field Assessment Books (FABs) paired with enlarged 1:10,000 base maps; outputs feed into mapping and change-detection processes.
  - Extensive coding scheme for vegetation, species, and habitat features; hierarchical, codified data enabling mapping, querying, and longitudinal comparisons.
  - Distinguishes mosses/lichens, forbs/woody species, and higher plant taxa with standardized lookups and notes on common and survey-specific codes.
  - Documentation supports linking FABs to base maps, theme maps (Physiography, Agriculture/Vegetation, Forestry, Boundaries, Buildings/Infrastructure), and Broad Habitat (BAP) maps.

- Sampling framework and square-level design
  - CS2000 revisits a core set of squares from CS1990 and adds new squares to strengthen stratification by country and land class.
  - Five soil sampling locations per square, with standardized center-plot sampling within X-plots across all squares.
  - Time-series continuity emphasized: sampling order and square selection designed to maintain comparability with prior years.

- Field procedures and equipment
  - Field work requires landowner permissions; on-site verification and documentation of access constraints.
  - Equipment distribution centralized; surveyors carry FABs, 1:10,000 maps, GPS, aerial photographs, field markers, and measurement tools.
  - Emphasis on field safety, plot marking, traceability, and efficient logistics to minimize revisits.

- Data capture and coding structure (FAB)
  - FABs use primary/secondary codes to describe area, line, and point features; vegetation and boundary types; species presence and cover (5% and 25% thresholds).
  - Codes organized into broad thematic groups (e.g., cover types, species, boundaries, buildings, roads).
  - Special survey codes (601–699) cover features outside standard codes; supports cross-temporal mapping.

- Vegetation recording specifics
  - Multiple plot types and nested sampling for vegetation inventories, with standardized forms listing 200 common species and space for unlisted taxa.
  - Standardized 5% cover categories; canopy and sub-canopy layers recorded; bryophytes/lichens have restricted lists with specific cover values.
  - Field procedures emphasize consistency with prior CS surveys to support time-series analyses.

- Mapping new squares and change mapping (CS1990/CS2000 approach)
  - For new squares, document stock and composition within the square; field judgment guides final coding with aerial guidance.
  - For changes in old squares, focus on change since 1990, using two broad habitat concepts:
    - Mappable Broad Habitats (Mappable BAPs): features where precise, CS1990-style coding tracks changes.
    - Plottable Broad Habitats (Plottable BAPs): upland/enclosed landscapes tracked with broader habitat mapping and additional plots (U plots).
  - Outputs include changes on theme maps and updates to BAP maps; procedures cover re-numbering, mosaics, and unchanged extents with new BAP codes.

- Plots and plot types for vegetation data collection
  - Areal plots (200 m2) with nested 4 m2 inner plots; Y plots, U plots, X plots (200 m2 with nested subplots), B plots (boundaries), A plots (arable margins), H/D plots (hedgerows and diversity), S/W plots (streams/waterside), R/V plots (roadsides/verges).
  - Plot relocation, recording, and permanent marking standardized (plates, GPS, photographs) to ensure repeatability.

- GPS data collection and Annex
  - Annex 1 outlines GPS data collection for precise relocation of permanent plots and alignment with GIS datasets.
  - Step-by-step procedures cover satellite checks (PDOP targets < 6 for 3D fixes), stationary vs moving feature logging, file naming conventions, and data rate settings.
  - File naming requires square number and plot identifier (e.g., 501X4.PSE); mobile feature files use descriptive codes (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
  - Guidance on overcoming obstructions, using aerial extenders, and entering plot IDs via the Magellan keypad.

- Practical GIS takeaways for field data
  - A rigorous, code-driven workflow supports robust GIS integration and time-series analyses.
  - Clear linkage among FABs, base maps, theme maps, and BAP maps; explicit distinction between Mappable vs Plottable Broad Habitats and their plotting strategies.
  - Detailed, extensible coding scheme with primary/secondary codes, percentage covers, and use-type attributes designed for querying and longitudinal comparisons.
  - Precise field protocols for plot placement, relocation, marking, and data capture to ensure spatial consistency across survey years.

- Photography and post-survey procedures
  - Photography required for every vegetation plot to document appearance and location relative to landmarks; one camera per team with initial film stock and a standardized labeling protocol.
  - Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and visible in photos; square/plot numbers displayed on a marker board.
  - Post-survey checks include verifying data sheets, avoiding unnecessary transcription, and transporting FABs/samples to ITE stations promptly.
