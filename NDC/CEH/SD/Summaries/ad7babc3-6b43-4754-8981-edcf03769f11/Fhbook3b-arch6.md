# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Provides standardized guidelines for data collection, mapping, and vegetation sampling across Britain to produce robust, comparable, policy-relevant time-series data.
- Aims to support national-scale indicators on biodiversity, land use, and landscape features through repeatable field procedures and standardized data formats.

## Data Collection Framework
- Data types and structure designed to enable change detection and trend analysis over time.
- Field activities organized around square-based sampling (1 x 1 km): includes a mix of old (revisiting 1990 squares) and new squares.
- Plots and sampling schemes:
  - X PLOTS: large plots (200 m²) with nested sub-plots.
  - Y PLOTS: smaller 2 m × 2 m plots (habitat-spanning).
  - U PLOTS: unenclosed 2 m × 2 m plots.
  - B PLOTS: boundary plots at field edges.
  - A PLOTS: arable field margins.
  - H PLOTS: hedgerow plots; D PLOTS: hedgerow diversity plots.
  - S/W PLOTS: streamside and waterside plots; R/V PLOTS: roadside and verge plots.
- Each plot includes header context, species checklists (~200 common species plus Latin names for unlisted species), cover estimates, and precise location data with GPS where applicable.

## Data Coding and Taxonomy
- Extensive crosswalk of species abbreviations and codes (e.g., Athy fil, Dryo fil) mapped to full scientific names.
- Separate sections for different taxa (forbs/woody species; mosses/lichens) with standardized coding to support consistent data entry and aggregation.
- Emphasis on avoiding over-coding, using primary/secondary codes, and linking map features to data recording forms.
- Mapping uses standardized codes on 1:10,000 base maps; historical boundaries marked with 999; new boundaries coded as 888.
- Annexes and sheets provide guidance for permissions, ownership, and background context to support data attribution and provenance.

## Field Procedures and Data Capture
- Planning and permissions:
  - Landowner consent required; advance letters and on-site confirmation.
  - Access refusals lead to square abandonment or partial data collection with notes.
- Data recording framework:
  - Field Assessment Books (FABs) used; data recorded in a standardized format to minimize bias and omissions.
  - Emphasis on clear, unambiguous mapping and habitat coding to support long-term comparability.
- Planning and logistics:
  - Six teams manage approximately 95 squares each; coordination of leave, travel, and coverage tailored to minimize omissions.

## Sampling Activities
- Soil sampling (Section 10.)
  - Five replicate soil samples per 1 km square, collected in X PLOTS.
  - Three cores per centre (2 × 2 m) per X-plot using specific pipe configurations (black long pipe and white short pipes).
  - Samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing; strict packaging and posting procedures to preserve sample integrity.
- Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling (Section 10.9–10.10)
  - Collect current year growth (CYG) shoots for nitrogen deposition analysis.
  - Random sampling across Calluna plants; 30–50 g fresh weight per sample; careful packing and timely dispatch to ITE Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11)
  - Conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff in coordination with CS2000 field teams.

## Photography and Documentation
- Photography: one camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks.
- Reference features: obvious, unique, permanent features near plots to aid relocation and interpretation.
- Plot labeling: photographs include square/plot identifiers on a visible board; framing guidelines to minimize sky and maximize plot context.

## Procedures After Survey
- Post-survey data quality checks: review data sheets to ensure no omissions; avoid post-hoc transcription unless necessary.
- Transport FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly to preserve data integrity.

## GPS Data and Management (Annex)
- Detailed steps for collecting and managing GPS data:
  - Ensure adequate satellite visibility (minimum four satellites; aim for PDOP below 6 for 3D fixes).
  - Record stationary positions (plots) and moving features (boundaries) with standardized file naming.
  - File naming convention uses square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE); mobile features get appropriate tags (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
  - Specific logging procedures, data rates, and attribute selection to accurately capture plot geometry and features.
- Battery management, almanac updates, and handling obstructions (e.g., tall vegetation) are addressed.
- An attribute reference sheet assists rapid selection of plot IDs and features during data capture.

## Data Products and Outputs
- Goal is production of standardized, high-quality, time-series data products that are directly usable for policy-relevant analyses and reporting.
- Data products integrate field observations, mapping changes, broad habitat reporting, and plot-based measurements to support biodiversity and land-use indicators.

## Summary
- The CS2000 Field Handbook provides a comprehensive, standardized framework for data collection, coding, mapping, sampling, and post-survey handling across Britain.
- It emphasizes data quality, comparability over time, and integration with policy-relevant indicators through meticulous procedures for plots, sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater), photography, GPS data, and data governance.
