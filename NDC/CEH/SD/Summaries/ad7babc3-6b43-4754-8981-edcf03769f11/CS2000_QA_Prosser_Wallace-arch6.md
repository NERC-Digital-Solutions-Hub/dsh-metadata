# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose of QA: assess consistency and reliability of CS2000 field work across a sample of squares, quantify accuracy of field recording and change statistics, and relate findings to the 1990 CS survey.
- Scope: QA on 38 of 519 squares from CS2000; resurvey of one quarter per square; total of 234 plots across nine plot types; comparison with CS2000 and with prior QA (1991 for CS1990).

## Aims
- Quantify accuracy of field recording in CS2000 and comment on change statistics.
- Examine plot relocation efficiency.
- Explain differences in recording via observer error, plot location/relocation, plot type, management, and season.
- Relate CS2000 findings to CS1990 QA results.

## Methods and Scope
- Selection: 38 squares (one quarter resurveyed); 34 squares also in 1990 CS; plots include quadrats, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, hedge plots.
- Relocation approach: locate buried plates marking quadrats; assess effectiveness eight years later; compare with 1991 QA.
- Data collection: 234 plots per square; three main types (X, Y, U) plus others; coding system for land cover, boundaries, and changes.
- Analysis: compare CS2000 vs QA (TI vs T2) for species; assess cover values; use DECORANA ordination to evaluate directional bias; assess mapping concordance across primary codes, BAP codes, and boundary features.

## Key Findings

- Plot relocation efficiency
  - 86.7% of full searches successfully relocated plots.
  - CS2000 surveyors precisely relocated 60% of 1990 plots; about 25% relocated more or less; roughly 15% inadequately relocated.
  - Small U plots were the most difficult (23% failure).
  - QA assessors located 69.3% of plates; overall relocation reliability eight years on comparable to 12 months after burial.
  - Overall interpretation: 60% accurate relocation, ~25% relocated with caveats, ~15% inadequately relocated; some relocating errors included misplacing plots on the wrong side of boundaries or stream banks.

- Species concordance
  - Across ~6000 original CS2000 records in 210 plots, initial concordance (species present in both times) ~71%; 2% non-concordances due to real management/seasonal changes.
  - QA found: mean number of species per plot CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4, indicating longer species lists in QA (likely due to more thorough searching); overall efficiency similar to CS1990 QA.
  - Plant species mis-matches analyzed and attributed to mis-location, mis-identification, overlooked species, or orientation errors.

- Vegetation cover
  - Comparison of cover for the 30 most frequent species showed several significant differences (e.g., grasses often driving mismatches); some differences attributed to season.
  - Overall cover agreement for key species generally reasonable; some species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum) showed significant or notable differences.
  - For land-use sample points, overall concordance ~63% (lower for some commonly misidentified grasses); certain species (e.g., Lolium perenne) showed high agreement, others lower due to misidentification or seasonality.
  - The general pattern: cover judgments were reasonably consistent but with species-specific discrepancies.

- Changes in frequency of the most prevalent species
  - Approximately 35% of mis-matches were due to overlooked species; distribution of mis-matches varied by plot type.
  - DECORANA ordination (Axis 1) showed that, despite plot-level discrepancies, overall shifts between CS2000 and QA were not biased directionally.
  - Ranking of species by frequency broadly similar between CS2000 and QA, with some well-known biases (e.g., mosses often overlooked; Poa trivialis over-recorded when any Poa present).
  - Table-based analyses indicate proportionate mis-matches distributed across plot types; overall impression: many discrepancies cancel at larger scales but remain notable at specimen level.

- Hedge diversity and land-use mapping
  - Land-cover mapping used primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes; overall concordance for primary land-cover codes ~88%; BAP codes ~77%; primary boundary codes ~85% (overall boundary concordance ~92% when including boundary features).
  - For hedge shapes and boundary features, agreement varied: hedge shape codes ~67.5% concordance; boundary height ~89.2% concordance; stockproof condition ~83.8%.
  - Mis-matches often due to new codes or changes in hedges/boundaries since 1990, or occasional omission of boundary codes.
  - BAP classifications showed some systematic discrepancies (e.g., mixing dwarf heath areas) and some room for updating boundaries to reflect habitat distribution.

- Change in land-use and boundary changes
  - Change concordance (CS2000 vs QA) was 51.4%; change not noted by CS2000 ~33.9%; changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors ~14.7%.
  - Indicates substantial proportion of landscape changes since 1990 may have been missed or not adequately recorded by CS2000; most of the discrepancy arises from differences in coding and interpretation at the time of survey vs QA.

- Arable plots
  - Very small sample (five plots); concordance between CS2000 and QA was extremely limited (about 30.6% agreement).
  - Seasonal effects and unfamiliarity with ruderal species contributed to low agreement.
  - Recommendation: two visits per arable margin plot to improve reliability.

- General mapping and boundary coding
  - Primary boundary coding showed strong concordance; a few recurring mis-matches (e.g., code 323, mixed hedge) and occasional noting of non-existent features.
  - Hedge shapes and boundary changes show that some “afterthought” coding occurred; overall, most boundary measurements were robust but some changes were missed or misinterpreted.

## ORDINATION AND MEAN AXIS CHANGES

- No directional bias detected between CS2000 and QA
  - Axis 1 mean scores: CS2000 387.8 vs QA 392.0; ANOVA p-value 0.847 (no significant difference).
  - Plot-type specific mean axis changes generally non-significant; changes largely reflect location/orientation and cover-mismatch issues rather than systematic bias.
- Plot classes grouped by landclass (LC, LG, MA, UP) show no significant time-by-landclass interaction, supporting lack of directional bias across landtypes.

## Overall Conclusions

- Mapping and boundary coding are broadly robust between CS2000 and QA, with high concordance for primary land-cover codes (≈88%), BAP codes (≈77%), and boundary features (≈92% overall code concordance; primary boundary codes ≈85%).
- Change detection between CS2000 and QA shows substantial room for improvement; about half of changes recorded matched QA, while a sizable portion were not noted or not substantiated, indicating potential under-recording of landscape change.
- Plot relocation reveals considerable variability; while relocation is generally feasible, eight-year-latency introduces challenges, and some plots cannot be relocated with confidence.
- Species recording is broadly reliable but exhibits notable discrepancies at the plot level due to mis-location, mis-identification, overlooked species, and seasonal effects; overall, QA replicates the general ordering of species abundance seen in CS2000.
- The arable margin plots require more intensive sampling (more visits) to achieve reliable results.
- Overall, for data use and interpretation, CS2000 outputs are largely reliable for mapping and habitat classification, but caution is warranted for change statistics and finer-scale species/cover determinations; the plot data remain the more reliable basis for evaluating long-term change.
