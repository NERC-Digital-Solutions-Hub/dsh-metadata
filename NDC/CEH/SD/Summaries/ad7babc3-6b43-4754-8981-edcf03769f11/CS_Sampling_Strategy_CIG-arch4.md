# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: describes the field survey sampling framework used for Countryside Survey up to 2007 and its evolution through successive refinements of the ITE Land Classification.
- Core idea: use a stratified, random sampling approach based on an environmental Land Classification system to ensure representative coverage of Great Britain’s ecological variation and to support national, and later country-specific, habitat estimates.

## Key Concepts

- Stratified sampling: divides land into discreet strata to avoid bias and ensure all parts of the population are represented.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental-based classification originally developed in the 1970s to stratify GB land into land classes; uses environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to group areas with similar ecological characteristics.
- Sampling units: 1 km square centres used for classification; the sample for surveys is drawn from these strata, sometimes with surrounding squares included depending on the survey design.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA): multivariate method used to group squares into land classes.
- Data aims: produce national and later country-specific estimates of habitat areas; link field observations with land-class areas to estimate totals and changes over time.

## Evolution of the Land Classification and Sampling Framework

- 1978 (Initial GB survey)
  - Land Classification: 32 classes derived from environmental attributes.
  - Sampling: eight 1 km squares per class (total 256 squares) surveyed in the field.
  - National estimates: calculated as the mean habitat area per square within each class multiplied by the area of each class.

- 1984 (Second GB survey)
  - Sampling increased: 12 squares per land class (384 total).
  - Land Classification remained the 32-class system; estimates reused the 1978 classification framework.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
  - Expanded to classify every GB 1 km square (more comprehensive baseline).
  - Surveyed 508 squares; repeated vegetation quadrats from 1978, added land-cover mapping (first Land Cover Map).
  - National estimates based on revised 1990 Land Classification.

- 1998–2000 (Developments for CS2000)
  - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to enable separate Scottish reporting.
  - Separate country estimates introduced: England & Wales vs Scotland (based on country units).
  - Classification updates required adjustments to sampling distribution; added new squares to improve representation of new classes.
  - 1990 classification continued to be used for cross-survey consistency, but CS2000 moved toward country-specific stratification.

- 2007 (Developments for CS2007)
  - Wales-focused reporting required further adjustments.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (England & Wales) creating five new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w; total strata increased to 45.
  - Additional Welsh sampling: 43 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of Welsh classes; some English classes retained lower sample counts (two classes with as few as 4 squares).
  - England adjustments: no corresponding increase in English squares; still acceptable precision per scoping study.
  - Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country unit in terms of proportion of land area sampled.

## Sampling Framework and Country-Level Adjustments

- England & Wales vs Scotland (country units): CS2000 introduced country-unit estimates with separate sub-classifications for each country unit, resulting in 40 strata; CS2007 expanded to 45 strata due to Welsh subdivisions.
- Uplands module (CS2000): additional sampling (30 squares) in upland areas to improve habitat estimates in upland regions of England and Wales.
- Wales-only and Wales-focused reporting: significant reallocation of sampling to Wales to enable Wales-only environmental reporting.

## Data Management and Implications

- Data assets: Land Classification maps, square-level survey data, and country-unit estimates; ongoing updates and re-classifications affect comparability.
- Consistency considerations: Changing the basic classification impacts cross-survey consistency; for within-survey national estimates, using the latest classification is preferred, but cross-survey comparability can favor using the original or earlier classifications.
- Documentation: extensive acknowledgments and references accompany the methodology; evolution of classifications is well-documented (including cross-referencing with past CS reports and the Land Classification history).

## Implications for Data Leaders

- Strategic value: the ITE Land Classification serves as a foundational data asset for ecological surveying, enabling robust stratified sampling and reliable habitat abundance estimates.
- Governance needs:
  - Versioning and provenance: track classification versions used in each survey to ensure reproducibility and clear comparability.
  - Metadata and documentation: maintain detailed records of class definitions, subdivisons (e.g., 5w, 5e), and country-unit adjustments.
  - Cross-border alignment: manage Wales, Scotland, and England/Wales reporting requirements as devolution evolves.
- Data quality and coverage:
  - Ensure adequate representation of small or underrepresented strata, particularly in Wales and upland regions.
  - Plan for data updates that reflect classification changes while preserving historical comparability for trend analyses.
- Collaboration and dissemination:
  - Coordinate with national partners (policy bodies, environmental organizations) to support country-specific environmental reporting.
  - Use the Land Classification as a basis for clear, actionable habitat and land-use statistics.
