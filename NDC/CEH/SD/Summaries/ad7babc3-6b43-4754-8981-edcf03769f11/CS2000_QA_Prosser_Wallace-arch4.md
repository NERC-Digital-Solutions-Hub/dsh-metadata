# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose: Assess consistency and reliability of the CS2000 field programme to measure data quality across a large, multi-recorder survey.
- Scope: QA on 38 of 519 squares (selected from 1998 data); resurvey of 234 species plots across nine plot types; comparison with CS2000 original data and prior CS1990 QA.

## Aims and Context for Data Leaders

- Quantify field recording accuracy and change statistics (CS2000 vs QA).
- Examine plot relocation efficiency and errors (location/orientation, plot type, management/season effects).
- Relate CS2000 findings to CS1990 to understand improvements or persistent issues.
- Provide an objective assessment of mapping, land cover coding, and boundary features, including hedge/wall attributes.

## Methods and Scope

- Sampling: 38 squares (out of 519); one quarter of each square rerecorded; some squares also compared with 1990 QA samples.
- Plots: 234 plots across main plot types (quadrats, X/Y/U plots, road verges, streamsides, arable margins, etc.).
- Plate/plot relocation: assessed recovery of buried plates and precise relocation; used sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors.
- Data elements: species records, percent cover, land-use mapping, boundary features, hedge shapes, and change recording.

## Key Findings

- Plot relocation
  - Recovery rate: 86.7% of plots and plates were relocatable; 60% accurately relocated, ~25% roughly relocated, ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - Y-plots (habitat plots) were most difficult (23% failure).
  - Compared with CS1991 QA (87.1%), CS2000 relocation is broadly comparable in efficacy after eight years.
  - Assessors located about 69.3% of plates; overall, relocation success estimated around 40–45% (depending on category inclusion).

- Species concordance
  - Approx. 71% of original species records were confirmed by assessors.
  - About 2% non-concordances due to real management/seasonal changes.
  - Overall field recording accuracy estimated at ~73%, close to the CS1990 figure when accounting for changes in plot location.

- Vegetation cover estimates
  - For the 30 most frequent, six species showed significantly different cover levels between surveyors and assessors (some likely seasonal effects).
  - Cover agreement improved overall compared with CS1990; notable differences remained for several grasses.
  - Some species showed consistent over- or under-estimation tendencies (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum).

- Direction of vegetation change
  - DECORANA axis shifts between time-one and time-two were generally insignificant, indicating no directional bias.

- Land-cover mapping
  - Codes categorized as primary, secondary descriptive, and cover codes.
  - Concordance: Primary land-cover codes 88%; BAP codes 77%; primary boundary codes 85%; principal qualifying land-cover codes 73%; species awarded cover codes 63%.
  - Overall primary land-cover agreement: 87.5% (including BAP) vs. 91.6% concordance (excluding BAP); maps fairly robust, with some systematic misclassifications (e.g., some grasses mislabeled as nearby habitat types).

- Recording of change
  - Change concordance between CS2000 and QA: 51.4% overall.
  - Change not noted by CS2000: 33.9%; changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors: 14.7%.
  - Indicates many real changes since 1990 may have been missed or misrecorded; reliance on map strings for change was common and areas of potential mis-coding identified (e.g., hedge types).

- Hedge diversity (hedge plots)
  - Total plots analyzed: 19; total species recorded: 124; common species: 92.
  - Agreement: 74.2% overall; surveyor efficiency: 77.4%.
  - Mean species per plot: CS2000 5.16 vs QA 5.89 (higher QA due to more thorough searching).

- Arable plots
  - Only five plots; concordance very poor, likely affected by seasonal timing and limited familiarity with ruderal species.
  - Recommendation: consider at least two visits per future arable-margin plots to improve reliability.

- Frequency changes of prevalent species
  - Mis-matches common among grasses and mosses; Poa trivialis often over-recorded; several grasses under-recorded (e.g., Agrostis capillaris, Elymus repens, Arrhenatherum, Cynosurus).
  - Seasonal shifts and plot-location/orientation errors contribute substantially to mismatches.

- Species cover at land-use sample points
  - Overall cover-concordance 74.4%; some species (e.g., Lolium perenne) show good agreement; others (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata) show weaker agreement due to seasonal timing and identification challenges.
  - Omission/addition patterns reflect seasonal management and identifying cover bands.

- Boundary features and hedge coding
  - Primary boundary codes concordance: 85%; boundary code concordance: 92%.
  - Hedge shapes (Code 374-380) had limited success; many hedges were captured under broader hedge codes (e.g., box-shaped hedge).
  - Hedge boundaries and stockproof status showed high concordance (boundary height 89.2%; stockproof 83.8%).

- Change in land use and coding
  - Level of concordance for change coding remains moderate to low in places; surveyors often retained original CS1990 codes or failed to add new change codes.
  - Indicates a need for clearer guidelines and perhaps more rigorous field verification when recording changes.

## Implications for Data Strategy and Governance

- Data reliability is generally strong for mapping and primary codes, with high concordance and minimal directional bias between CS2000 and QA.
- Significant opportunities to improve: 
  - Location/orientation accuracy and plate/plot relocation methods, especially for small or linear plot types.
  - Capture and verification of changes over time, including explicit documentation of real changes vs. coding corrections.
  - Seasonal effects and observer differences in species identification and cover estimation; consider standardized timing windows or multiple visits.
  - Arable-margin plots require additional visits and training due to low concordance.
- Data management takeaways for data leaders:
  - Emphasize robust metadata and provenance to document changes, observer identity, timing, and plot relocation status.
  - Ensure clear, scalable coding schemes for land cover, hedges, boundaries, and hedge/wall conditions; revisit coding schemas that proved brittle (e.g., hedge codes).
  - Invest in reproducible QA workflows to quantify observer effects and to benchmark against prior surveys (CS1990) for continuity.

## Overall Assessment

- CS2000 field data quality demonstrates substantial reliability in mapping and boundary coding, with reasonable species recording accuracy and cover estimation.
- Key weaknesses center on plot relocation precision (especially for small plots), detection/recording of changes, and arable/ruderal plant identification under limited sampling.
- The QA confirms that, while improvements over prior surveys exist, ongoing enhancements in standardization, metadata, and repeat visits are needed to strengthen long-term data reliability for data-driven decision-making.

## Recommendations (Actionable for Data Leaders)

- Strengthen plot relocation protocols:
  - Increase emphasis on permanent markers or more precise geolocation methods; improve documentation of plot location to support exact replication.
- Standardize change recording:
  - Develop clearer guidelines and training for identifying real ecological change vs. coding changes; consider mandatory cross-checks for potential changes.
- Enhance arable-margin data collection:
  - Plan multiple visits across seasons; improve training for ruderal and sorghum-like species identification; increase sample size if possible.
- Improve metadata and data governance:
  - Attach detailed provenance, observer IDs, season, plot-type, and location accuracy to each record.
  - Maintain versioned codes and audit trails for land-cover, boundary, and hedge classifications.
- Apply QA feedback to data products:
  - Use QA metrics to prioritize data cleaning, re-surveys, and targeted training in identified weak areas.
- Foster data-sharing and comparability:
  - Align CS2000 data schemas with prior CS1990 data and future surveys to facilitate longitudinal analyses and communities of practice.
