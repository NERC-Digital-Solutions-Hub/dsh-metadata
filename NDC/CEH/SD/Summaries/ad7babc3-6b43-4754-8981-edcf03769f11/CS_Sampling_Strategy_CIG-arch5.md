# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework for Countryside Survey GB from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes a stratified, representative sampling approach to enable robust national and country-specific estimates of habitat and land-use features.
- Highlights updates to classification schemes, reporting units (England, Scotland, Wales), and the need for time-series comparability.

## Core concepts for data governance
- Stratified random sampling to minimize bias and ensure representative coverage of diverse land types.
- Use of the ITE Land Classification to carve GB into discrete strata (land classes) based on environmental attributes.
- Expansion from centre-square classifications to include surrounding squares for each centre to form a robust sample frame.
- Data lineage and versioning: Land Classification evolved across surveys (32 → 40 → 45 classes) with reclassification of squares and the need to map between versions for consistent temporal comparisons.
- Metadata implications: documentation of changes in classification, sampling design, and country-specific sub-division essential for correct interpretation and reuse.
- Data provenance and publication: results published per survey (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) with explicit methods and classifications guiding national estimates.

## Land Classification Development timeline
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification): 32 classes; centre-square method; 8 squares per class (256 total); baseline for estimating habitat areas.
- 1984 (2nd Field Survey): 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of 1978 classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification): expansion to classify all 1 km squares in GB; 508 squares surveyed; integration with Land Cover Map; results published in CS1990 main report.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification for CS2000): classification extended to enable Scotland reporting; 40 classes; adjustments to sampling to support country-specific estimates; separate country estimates introduced.
- 2007 (Developments for CS2007): Wales-only reporting requirements drive further subdivision into country-unit classes (five new Welsh sub-classes); total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares added; England adjustments made due to loss of Welsh samples.

## Sampling framework across surveys
- 1978: 256 samples across 32 land classes; stratified random framework designed to be representative of GB.
- 1984: expanded sampling within each class to 12 squares; ongoing use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990: “All Squares” approach; 508 squares; revised to include urban/sea corrections; Land Classification aligned with broader policy needs.
- 2000 (CS2000): refined country-unit framework (England with Wales, Scotland separately); added 40 strata; included upland habitat module; more squares allocated to ensure adequate representation across classes.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-focused reporting needs driven new class subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and overall 45 strata; Wales received 107–112 squares across the updated framework; England retained adjustments to maintain balance; detailed maps and tables provided for revised distribution.

## Country estimates and data governance implications
- Introduction of separate country-unit estimates due to devolution and policy needs (England with Wales vs Scotland; later Wales-only framing).
- Classification changes over time necessitate careful cross-walks between original and revised Land Class maps to ensure consistent national estimates.
- England, Scotland, and Wales each have distinct sampling distributions and reporting requirements, impacting data management, version control, and interoperability of time-series datasets.
- Isle of Man adjustments included replacing legacy samples to maintain country-unit integrity; underscores need for clear documentation of non-GB components in a data stewarding context.

## Uplands module
- CS2000 included an uplands module with 30 additional squares placed in upland/marginal land classes to improve habitat estimates in higher elevations.
- Aimed at increasing statistical accuracy for upland habitat figures within country-specific reporting.

## Data access and publication
- Results associated with each survey published in companion reports (CS1990 main report, CS2000, CS2007 UK results, etc.), reflecting evolving classification schemes and sampling designs.
- Data stewardship considerations include ensuring that reused data can be traced to the correct Land Classification version, survey year, and country unit, with clear methodological notes on any reclassification or sampling adjustments.

## Additional notes
- The document provides a detailed historical rationale for methodological changes, including implications for national estimates, class representation, and cross-year comparability.
- Emphasizes the importance of transparent documentation when data classifications evolve, to support robust governance, sharing, and long-term usability.
