# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Provides standardized, time-series field data collection to monitor environmental condition, biodiversity, and policy relevance.
- Aligns field data with national and international biodiversity assessments and supports integration with remote sensing.
- Emphasizes consistency, traceability, and efficient data transfer to central databases and monitoring portals.

## Flora and Nomenclature Coding
- Contains extensive, standardized nomenclature for plants (ferns, forbs, mosses/lichens) with coded references.
- Includes mappings and crosswalks to scientific names (e.g., Cardamine hirsuta/flexuosa) to ensure consistent data entry and later processing.

## Data Structure and Plot Framework
- Field data collected on a time-series basis using a structured plot system (e.g., CS2000 CS1990 lineage) to capture changes in vegetation and habitat.
- Emphasizes mapping change, broad habitat reporting, and plot-based data collection across upland and lowland contexts.
- Annexed materials provide base maps and habitat maps to support change detection and mosaic classifications.

## Sampling Types and Protocols
- Three main sampling types:
  - Soil sampling: five replicate cores per 1 km square X-plot, analyzed for pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals, soil fauna, and microbiology; samples shipped to ITE Merlewood.
  - Calluna sampling: collects current-year growth (CYG) shoots for foliar nitrogen analysis to assess deposition impacts; strict packaging and dispatch procedures.
  - Freshwater biota sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff, coordinated with field teams.

## Soil Sampling Protocol
- In each 1 km square X-plot, five soil samples are collected from the centre plot (2 x 2 m) using three cores (one long black pipe and two short white pipes).
- Detailed step-by-step collection, sealing, labeling, and rapid transport requirements to ensure sample integrity.
- Emphasis on documenting precise sampling locations and preserving sample quality during transit.

## Calluna Sampling and Nitrogen Deposition
- Collects CYG Calluna vulgaris shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from various plants within the square.
- Samples must be dried slightly if too wet, sealed, labeled, and dispatched promptly to Merlewood for analysis.
- Aims to use foliar nitrogen concentrations to infer regions with nitrogen deposition exceeding critical loads.

## Freshwater Sampling
- Conducted by IFE staff in collaboration with CS2000 coordinators.
- Coordination ensures sampling occurs contemporaneously with terrestrial surveys to enable integrated environmental assessments.

## Equipment, Labeling, and Packaging
- Equipment distributed to field teams includes cool boxes, trowels, knives, measuring tapes, and special piping for soil cores.
- Each envelope, bag, and pipe is uniquely labeled with square and plot identifiers to ensure traceability.
- Standardized packing procedures enable reliable mail-back of samples and data sheets.

## Photography and Documentation
- Teams photograph vegetation plots using assigned cameras; films and prompts emphasize permanence and obvious reference features.
- Photos must clearly show square and plot numbers and be positioned to maximize useful reference features for future re-visits.

## Procedures After Survey
- Post-survey data checks and verification are essential to ensure completeness and accuracy.
- Original FABs (Field Assessment Books) should be preserved; data may be transposed only if necessary due to damage or loss.
- Arrangements are made to transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

## GPS Data Collection and Annex Guidance
- Annex 1 provides comprehensive steps for GPS data collection, including ensuring adequate satellite visibility (PDOP < 6), stationary vs. moving position logging, and file naming conventions.
- Each plot or feature has a unique data file name (e.g., 501X4.PSE), enabling precise relocation and data management.
- Guidance covers battery management, almanac updates, data logging procedures, and error minimization strategies.

## Outputs and Relevance for Environmental Monitoring
- The integrated data framework supports trend analysis, policy appraisal, and biodiversity assessments under national strategies.
- Standardization enables linking field observations with remote sensing-derived land-cover data and other datasets.
- Emphasizes time-series integrity, cross-year comparability, and robust data provenance for long-term environmental monitoring.
