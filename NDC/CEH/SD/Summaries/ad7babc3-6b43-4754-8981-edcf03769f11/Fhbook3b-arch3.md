# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Outlines sampling, data capture, and field methods used in CS2000 to support soil, vegetation, and freshwater monitoring.
- Emphasizes standardized procedures to ensure comparability over time and across squares, with coordination between CS2000 field teams, ITE Merlewood, and the Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE).
- Includes guidance on data capture, handling, storage, and subsequent data management and analysis.

## Section 10 - Sampling
- Three types of sampling within CS2000:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by accredited IFE staff)
- Background and purpose:
  - Establish baseline soil quality with indices of soil biological activity and diversity to inform policy and site sustainability assessments.
  - Provide nationally spatially referenced soil data from the same 1 km squares used in earlier surveys to support time-series analyses.
- Soil sampling design and targets:
  - Five replicate samples per 1 km square for soil chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and soil microbiological status.
  - Samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing and storage.
  - Each set comprises three cores taken with plastic piping (two short white pipes and one long black pipe) from the center plot of the X-plot, positioned relative to the north corner (15 cm north, east, and west points).
  - Ensure rapid handling for short-shelf-life components (white pipes) via mail to ITE Merlewood; longer samples stored in the vehicle until collected.
- Calluna sampling:
  - Collect current year’s growth (CYG) from Calluna vulgaris within each square (within plots or elsewhere but inside the square).
  - Sample 30–50 g fresh weight, random selection from multiple Calluna plants.
  - If needed, allow drying post-collection before sealing; dispatch via internal routes (reporting-in to ITE or posting to ITE Merlewood) with receipts claimed on travel and subsistence forms.
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Conducted by trained IFE staff; CS2000 field coordinators coordinate scheduling to avoid conflicts and ensure proper timing with field teams.
- Documentation and handling:
  - All samples labeled, bagged, and mailed with appropriate envelopes and pipes, following strict packaging and labeling instructions.
  - Samples stored in a cool box or designated container until dispatch.

## Section 11 - Photography
- Equipment:
  - One camera per team; initial stock of film; additional film purchased and claimed via T&S forms.
- Objective:
  - Photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and context relative to landmarks.
- Reference features and composition:
  - Choose obvious, unique, and permanent reference features.
  - Include square and plot numbers on a board placed at the edge of the plot, preferably covering the marker plate.
  - Frame plots so up to half the frame shows the plot with clear reference features; avoid excessive sky to optimize light readings.
- Standards:
  - Examples of correct and incorrect photography practices provided at Field Training Course.

## Section 12 - Procedures after Survey
- Data verification:
  - After each day, review data sheets to ensure no features are omitted.
  - If necessary, data may be transposed onto fresh maps and forms, but this should be a last resort and only in cases of damage or loss of the original maps.
- Data transport:
  - FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE Stations as soon as possible.

## Annex 1 - Collecting GPS data
- Purpose:
  - Enable precise plot relocation and time-series consistency; ensures accurate spatial referencing for all plots and features.
- Battery power and satellite checks:
  - Ensure external power connections are secure; verify at least four satellites with a PDOP ideally below 6 (good 3D accuracy).
  - Maintain battery power and use spare battery as needed.
- Recording stationary vs moving positions:
  - Stationary positions: record at plot locations.
  - Moving features (e.g., new boundaries): log from start to end of the feature.
- File naming and data management:
  - Each plot or feature requires a unique data file named with square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE); new features use a specific coding (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
  - Use a 15-second logging rate for consistency; select the correct plot ID quickly via an attribute reference sheet.
- Logging operations:
  - Start/stop logging using the device interface; monitor time, elapsed time, and longest continuous logging periods.
- Handling obstructions and equipment tips:
  - If the view is obstructed, adjust antenna height temporarily to achieve better sky visibility.
  - Use Magellan keypad for entering numbers and letters; backspace with CLEAR.
- Recording stationary plot positions:
  - Place GPS in a clear area with minimal obstructions; allow 3–5 minutes of logging if the sky is unobstructed.
- PDOP guidance:
  - Aim for PDOP levels below 6 for robust 3D positioning; higher PDOP reduces accuracy.
- Data integrity and references:
  - An almanac update occurs automatically if out-of-date.
  - Attribute reference list and sheets provide quick access to plot identifiers and feature IDs for efficient data entry.
- Data management overview:
  - Annex includes crosswalks to map CS1990 to CS2000 codes, supporting coherent time-series analyses and integration with back-end databases.
