# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

- The document outlines the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007, detailing how the sampling strategy evolved over 30 years and how the ITE Land Classification underpins habitat and land-use monitoring.
- It emphasizes linking sampling design to policy-relevant environmental indicators and change detection, ensuring compatibility with predecessors while meeting ongoing needs.

## Purpose and Context

- Provides a narrative of how Countryside Survey sampling has been developed to detect change and inform policy, with the ITE Land Classification acting as the stratification backbone.
- Stresses the need for representative sampling across Britain, enabling national and country-specific estimates (England with Wales, Scotland, Wales) and later upland habitat focus in England and Wales.

## Key Concepts: Stratified Sampling and Land Classification

- Stratified, random sampling is used to avoid bias and ensure representativeness across ecological variation.
- ITE Land Classification system partitions land into discrete classes (originally 32, later expanded to 40–45 with country-specific subdivisions) to stratify sampling.
- Environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) drive class definitions; the approach anticipates complexity beyond simple geographic stratification.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification

- 1970s: Early development in the Lake District; Quadrat-based vegetation concepts scaled to land areas; use of Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to group environmental attributes into land classes.
- 1978: GB-wide survey used a 1 km square sampling unit; centre squares of a 15x15 km grid classified (1228 squares) with four surrounding squares allocated to classes; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class).
- 1984: Land use and habitat mapping emphasized; sample size increased by 50% (12 squares per class); continued use of 1978 classification for national estimates.
- 1990: CS1990 linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; all GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; added urban/sea corrections; expanded to use land-class surrogates for regional estimates.
- 1998–2000: New land classification to enable Scotland-only reporting; 40 classes; separate country estimates introduced; 40 strata formed, with additional squares to improve representation.
- 2007: Wales-only reporting requirements led to Wales-specific class subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and 45 strata; 43 extra Welsh squares added; England classes adjusted to compensate for Welsh additions; upland habitat module added to improve country-specific accuracy.

## Sampling Framework by Survey (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007)

- CS1978:
  - 8 squares per Land Class; total of 256 squares.
  - Field survey focused on vegetation quadrats and soils; habitats mapped.
  - National estimates derived from mean habitat area per square multiplied by land-class area.
- CS1984:
  - 12 squares per class; total 384 squares.
  - Expansion to land-use and landscape features; estimates continued to rely on 1978 classification for consistency.
- CS1990:
  - All GB squares classified with a revised Land Classification; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Repetition of 1978 vegetation quadrats; inclusion of the first Land Cover map linkage.
- CS2000:
  - Expanded to address policy needs for separate England, Scotland, and Wales estimates.
  - Land Classification updated; introduction of country-unit versions of classes; 40 strata redefined to 40+ via sub-division/aggregation.
  - Additional uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
- CS2007:
  - Wales-focused reporting requirements drove further Welsh class subdivisions (five new Welsh classes) and increased Welsh sampling (minimum 6 squares per new class).
  - England Wales Scotland country framework revised; total Welsh squares increased to support Wales-only reporting; England sampling adjusted accordingly.
  - Wales-specific maps and class structures implemented to support policy-relevant Wales-only estimates.

## Country-Specific Reporting and Uplands Module

- Separate country estimates introduced to provide England with Wales, Scotland, and Wales-specific results, addressing devolved policy needs.
- Wales required additional Welsh-only classes and more squares to achieve adequate precision for Wales-only reporting.
- An uplands module (CS2000) added 30 squares in upland areas to bolster habitat estimates where country-level reporting could be under-sampled without it.

## Outputs, Data, and National Estimates

- Outputs include habitat-area estimates, change indicators, and country-level results, presented in reports and maps (e.g., CS1990 main report, CS2007 summary, and associated figures/tanles).
- National estimates require careful consistency across land-class classifications; the report discusses how changing classifications affects comparability and recommends using the latest classification for internal consistency while noting cross-survey comparability considerations.
- Tables and figures summarize sample numbers, strata areas, and sampling rates by survey and country unit, illustrating the evolving sampling intensity and coverage.

## Relevance to Monitoring Frameworks

- Demonstrates how a monitoring framework can balance long-running time-series data with evolving classification schemes and policy needs.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - A robust, stratified sampling design anchored to a consistent environmental classification.
  - Transparent adaptation to devolved governance structures (England, Scotland, Wales) and upland priorities.
  - Clear documentation of sampling changes, class definitions, and national vs. country-level estimation approaches to maintain data integrity and policy relevance.
- Identifies data governance considerations indirectly, including maintaining representative data coverage, updating classifications, and ensuring outputs support decision-making across multiple government layers.
