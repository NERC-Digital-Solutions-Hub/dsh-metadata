# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview

- Field handbook for CS2000 detailing standardized data collection across GB, including soil sampling, Calluna sampling, freshwater sampling, photography, GPS data collection, and post-survey procedures.
- Emphasizes data standardization, traceability, timely sample handling, and integration with laboratory analysis (ITE Merlewood) and external partners (Institute of Freshwater Ecology).

## Sampling Types and Protocols

- Three main sampling types:
  - Soil sampling (CS2000 field surveyors)
  - Calluna sampling (CS2000 field surveyors)
  - Freshwater biota sampling (accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff)
- Goal: establish national, spatially referenced baseline data to support soil quality and biodiversity monitoring.

## Soil Sampling Details

- In each 1 km square, five replicate soil samples collected from X-plots (centered 2 x 2 m plots) for chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiology.
- Sample handling:
  - Three cores per centre plot using specific pipe sizes (long black pipe; two short white pipes); samples posted to ITE Merlewood; chemistry samples sent by car/coord in batches.
  - Quick processing for short-duration analyses (fauna and microbiology) due to short shelf-life.
- Procedure per square:
  - Locate north corner of centre plot; sample 15 cm north, then 15 cm east, then 15 cm west of the first point.
  - Use prescribed pipes and aluminum plates; hammer to drive pipes; extract soil; seal and label; post promptly.
- Equipment distribution: items marked with * distributed to each team; items marked with # distributed per square; rest standard CS2000 equipment.

## Calluna Sampling Details

- Collect Calluna vulgaris foliage to assess foliar nitrogen concentrations as an indicator of nitrogen deposition.
- Sampling:
  - In every 1 km square with Calluna, collect current year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants.
  - Seal and label samples; if wet, allow to dry slightly before sealing; despatch to ITE Merlewood promptly or via station reporting.

## Freshwater Sampling

- Conducted by IFE staff in coordination with CS2000; sampling occurs concurrently with field surveys as arranged with regional coordinators.

## Data Capture and Documentation

- Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) used to record mapping, plots, vegetation data, and supplementary data; ensure data are neat and unambiguous.
- Photographs accompany each vegetation plot to document appearance and position; capture features that are obvious, unique, and permanent; label photos with square/plot numbers and reference features.
- Post-survey data handling:
  - Read and verify data sheets daily; avoid transcription unless necessary due to damage; transport FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.

## Photography Guidelines

- One camera per team; initial film stock provided; use print film to photograph every vegetation plot.
- Reference features should be clearly visible, permanent, and near the plot; position marker boards with square/plot numbers in frame; avoid excessive sky.

## GPS Data Collection and Annex

- Annex 1 provides GPS data collection procedures:
  - Ensure sufficient satellite visibility (minimum four satellites; aim for PDOP < 6).
  - Record stationary positions (plots) and moving features (boundaries) with defined file naming conventions (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4).
  - Maintain dedicated data files for each plot/feature; select appropriate attribute codes; log time and status during collection.
  - Battery management, almanac updates, and PDOP guidance described; guidance for extending antenna to overcome obstructions.
- File naming and attribute options are specified to ensure traceability and consistency across surveys.

## Data Quality, Governance, and Logistics

- Emphasis on standardizing procedures to maintain time-series integrity and enable reliable longitudinal analysis.
- Clear guidance on equipment distribution, labeling, and sample packaging to minimize loss and mislabeling.
- Coordination with external laboratories (ITE Merlewood) and freshwater specialists (IFE) for timely processing and storage of samples.

## Post-Survey Procedures

- Ensure data sheets are complete and accurate; avoid unnecessary re-entry of data unless essential.
- Organize and transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly to maintain sample integrity and data quality.

## Annexes and Supporting Tools

- Annex 1: Collecting GPS data (step-by-step operational guidance).
- Reference materials for GPS equipment, file naming, and attribute coding to support standardized data capture and future data integration.

## Outputs and Usage

- Generates a national, spatially referenced data framework for soil chemistry, soil fauna, microbiology, Calluna foliar nitrogen, and freshwater biota.
- Data intended for policy support, biodiversity and soil health monitoring, and integration with broader landscape analyses.
