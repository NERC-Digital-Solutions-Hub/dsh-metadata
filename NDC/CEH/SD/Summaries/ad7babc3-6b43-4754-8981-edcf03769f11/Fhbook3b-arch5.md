# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview for Data Stewards
- The handbook documents standardized field sampling and data capture for CS2000, including soil, Calluna, and freshwater sampling, photography, GPS data collection, and post-survey procedures.
- Aims to enable consistent, traceable data collection across GB, with data stored, transported, and ready for analysis by ITE Merlewood and partners.
- Emphasizes metadata, sample transport logistics, and reproducibility to support long-term biodiversity and land-use analyses.

## Sampling framework and types
- Three sampling types:
  - Soil sampling: five replicate soil samples per 1 km square (within X-plots), used for chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiological status.
  - Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen concentration studies to assess nitrogen deposition impacts; collects current-year growth (CYG) from Calluna vulgaris.
  - Freshwater sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff in coordination with field teams.
- Soil sampling framework:
  - Five soil cores per square location: center plot and four surrounding points (as per protocol).
  - Samples distributed to ITE Merlewood for processing and storage; short-lived samples posted promptly; longer samples collected by regional coordinators.
- Calluna sampling framework:
  - Collects 30–50 g of CYG shoots from Calluna vulgaris plants, within the square, and ships promptly to ITE Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Conducted concurrently by IFE staff; planning coordinated with CS2000 field coordinators.

## Equipment, packaging, and distribution
- Equipment elements:
  - Cool box, trowel, long blade knife, measuring tape, lump hammer, aluminum plate, steel/plastic sample containers, end caps, and labeled bags.
  - Envelopes and bags distributed per ITE square and plot numbers; mobile file naming for new features.
- Packaging and labeling:
  - Large plastic bags labeled with ITE square numbers; five SAEs per square; pipes and end caps organized by square/plot numbers.
  - Envelope contents organized so packages fit standard post boxes; all items tracked by location (square and X plot numbers).
- Logistics and submission:
  - Postage receipts claimed on T&S forms; calls for prompt despatch to Merlewood for soil and Calluna samples.
  - Samples stored in car boot cool box or cardboard boxes until courier drop-off or mail.

## Detailed sampling procedures
- Center plot sampling (2 x 2 m) in each X-plot:
  1. Identify center plot north corner; mark spot 15 cm north; clear vegetation as needed.
  2. Take first soil sample with long black pipe; core to >5 cm; insert, drive with hammer to level of soil surface; remove soil; bag and label; store for transport.
  3. Take second soil sample 15 cm east of first using a short white pipe; follow same steps; cap ends; bag and label; position in envelope for posting.
  4. Take third soil sample 15 cm west of first using a white pipe; follow same steps.
  5. Seal envelope; store in cool box; post when feasible.
  6. Repeat for all center plots in every X-plot (total of five soil sampling locations per square).
- Documentation and notes:
  - Write location specifics on notes inside bags; include any notable roots or obstructions.
  - Maintain a clear chain of custody through packaging and labeling.

## Calluna sampling procedure
- Within every square where Calluna vulgaris occurs:
  - Collect current year's growth (CYG) from multiple plants; random sampling across area.
  - Weigh 30–50 g fresh weight; place in provided bag; seal and label; if very wet, air circulate before sealing.
  - Send sealed samples to ITE Merlewood via posted envelope or transport through research station.

## Freshwater sampling coordination
- CS2000 field surveyors and IFE staff may sample in the same square; coordination ensures appropriate timing and access.

## Photography (Section 11)
- Each vegetation plot photographed using team cameras; print film preferred; photographs document general appearance and reference features.
- Reference features should be obvious, unique, permanent, and visible in future visits.
- Each photo must display square and plot numbers on a provided board, placed at the plot edge; ensure legible labeling and minimize sky in frame.

## Procedures after survey (Section 12)
- End-of-day data integrity checks:
  - Review data sheets to ensure no features are omitted.
  - Transposing data to fresh maps/forms is discouraged unless necessary due to damage or loss of originals.
- Logistics:
  - FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE Stations promptly.

## Annex 1 - Collecting GPS data
- Battery power and satellite checks:
  - Ensure GPS has sufficient satellites (PDOP ideally below 6 for accurate 3D fixes).
  - If obstructed, elevate antenna; ensure a clear line of sight to satellites.
- Static vs moving data collection:
  - Stationary positions: record at plot locations for fixed features.
  - Moving features: log along the entire feature from start to end.
- File naming and data management:
  - Each plot/feature requires a unique GPS data file named with square and plot identifiers (e.g., 501X4.PSE or 501F1.MOB for new features).
  - Use 15 options for feature attributes to categorize new features according to theme.
- Logging and data capture:
  - Set sampling rate to 1 second; start/stop logging with clear prompts.
  - Maintain separate traces for time, elapsed time, and longest run.
- Power management:
  - Charge batteries fully; manage external power or spare batteries; keep a note of almanac status.
- Attribute reference and sheet:
  - Quick-key reference to plot IDs (e.g., X1, D1, Y1, etc.) to expedite data entry.

## Data structure, codes, and documentation (context for Data Stewards)
- The handbook uses structured parcel and plot coding to link map features to data entries, with cross-references to old parcel codes and new parcel prefixes for changes.
- GPS data and photography are integrated into the dataset with standardized file naming, metadata, and reference identifiers to support reproducibility across years and teams.
- Metadata, sampling history, and QA steps are implied through procedures, forms (FABs), and post-survey checks, enabling data lineage and policy-relevant analyses.

## Practical considerations and challenges for data governance
- Ensuring timely collection and shipment of soil and Calluna samples to ITE Merlewood; tracking parcels and shipments is critical.
- Maintaining consistent GPS data quality across teams and years; PDOP monitoring and equipment handling are essential.
- Coordinating field photography and ensuring consistent labeling and referencing across plots and years.
- Preserving data integrity after survey, avoiding unnecessary transposition, and safeguarding original records.
- Managing complex coding schemes and reference lists for taxa, habitats, and features to support cross-year comparability and integration with other datasets.
