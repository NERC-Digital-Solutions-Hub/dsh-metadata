# Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy Supporting documentation for data

- Purpose and scope
  - A collaborative project (CINAg) between China and the UK to optimise farm practices and soil management for more effective use of nitrogen sources and to reduce environmental Nr losses.
  - Aims to deliver holistic indicators of soil health and nutrient use efficiency (NUE), informed farm practices, and knowledge transfer to Chinese farmers via the Science and Technology Backyard programme.
  - Four work packages: WP1 fundamental understanding of N cycling; WP2 novel N technologies; WP3 improved agronomic practices; WP4 predictive capacity and knowledge exchange.

- Monitoring indicators and approach for policy and decision-making
  - Develop novel NUE indicators integrated with real-time physical/chemical soil metrics to assess soil health and guide management.
  - Test and refine indicators through field experiments and multi-site farm platforms to support sustainable intensification.
  - Emphasis on data quality, openness and governance to enable transparent decision-making and replication.

- Study design and data sources (locations and platforms)
  - Four UK farm platforms (North Wyke, Harpenden, Henfaes Farm, Easter Bush) used for inorganic fertilizer and digestate experiments (2016–2017); EB and HA also contribute 2017 grassland trials.
  - Cross-UK soil Sampling in 2018 across nine sites with diverse land uses (Scotland, Wales, England) to compare soil health and aboveground biomass.
  - Site characteristics include soil types, textures, mean annual temperature and precipitation, and land-use diversity to support broad applicability.

- Experimental information and treatments
  - 2016 inorganic fertilizer grass trials at NW, HF, EB with a complete randomized block design; treatments include Urea (U), Urea with inhibitor (IU), Ammonium-nitrate (AN), and controls; P, K, S applied per guidelines.
  - 2017 digestate trial on winter wheat at NW and HF; five treatments (digestate with/without inhibitors, acidified digestate with/without inhibitor, and control); target N rate ~190 kg N ha-1 from digestate with site-specific adjustments.
  - 2018 UK-wide sampling across multiple land uses to measure biomass and soil parameters, with some sites tied to the UGRASS project data.

- Protocols and data processing framework
  - Clear separation of protocols for WP1 (fundamental measurements) and WP2 (on-field technological applications) with same-day, site-wide sampling where possible; harvests aligned to peak biomass.
  - Yields and biomass
    - Grass yields (dry matter, CP, ME, NDF, ADF, etc.) measured across sites; digestate and inorganic fertilizer plots sampled for yield and quality.
    - Wheat yields (grain, straw) and components (TGW) measured; N content derived from laboratory analyses.
  - Nitrogen metrics
    - Plant N content, N offtake, NUE (NUEc for crop, NUEg for grain) calculated from harvested biomass and N content; adjustments for digestate and fertilizer types.
  - Greenhouse gases
    - Ammonia (NH3) emission measurements via wind tunnels and passive samplers; cumulative NH3 emissions calculated per plot.
    - Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions measured with manual and automatic chambers; fluxes calculated per standard methods; cumulative fluxes modeled with Bayesian/MCMC approaches.
  - Soil sampling and analyses (WP1 and WP2)
    - Topsoil cores (0–15 cm) and deeper layers (up to 30 cm) with standardized coring; extracts and analyses for NH4+, NO3-, amino acids, peptides, mineralisable N; DOC/TDN measurements; soil microbial biomass (MBC/MBN); aggregate size distribution; soil texture; moisture and SOM; pH and EC; base cations; total C/N; total P; POXC; P fractions (CE, Olsen, acetic acid extractable P); DNA/N genes via qPCR (nifH, amoA, nirK/nirS, nosZ, ureC); microbial diversity (16S rRNA and ITS sequencing); soil infiltration and water release curves.
  - QA/QC and data handling
    - Use of standardized QA/QC protocols, reference standards, and LIMS for data management; multi-lab collaboration with cross-checks; detailed protocols for sample handling, storage, and analysis; MCMC/Bayesian methods for flux estimation; data compiled in Excel with subsequent statistical processing in R.
  - Data outputs and dissemination
    - Outputs include yields, N content, NUEs, NH3/N2O emissions, soil nutrient pools, DOC/TDN, microbial and genetic indicators, soil physical properties, and hydrology-related measurements.
    - Project publications and a project webpage provide access to datasets and study results; data sharing is aligned with open data norms where feasible.

- Governance, data sharing, and policy-relevant implications
  - The project emphasizes transparent data management, metadata clarity, and sharing of underlying datasets to support governance and policy evaluation.
  - Outputs are designed to inform farm-management decisions and broader policy on nitrogen efficiency and environmental protection, with pathways to translate findings to farmers in China and the UK.
  - Recognizes challenges common to monitoring frameworks: data gaps, data access timeliness, organizational silos, metadata inadequacies, data transformation burdens, communication of complex results, and establishing robust data governance to ensure data quality and longevity.

- Practical takeaways for monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation
  - Establish holistic NUE indicators that integrate real-time soil health metrics with agronomic outcomes.
  - Design multi-site, multi-year monitoring to capture variability in N cycling, emissions, and soil properties across land uses and soil types.
  - Ensure standardized sampling protocols, transparent QA/QC, and open data practices to enable comparability and policy scrutiny.
  - Leverage integrated data products (reports, charts, dashboards) to communicate complex results clearly to policymakers, practitioners, and the public.
  - Build capacity for translating scientific indicators into practical guidelines for farmers and stakeholders, including knowledge transfer programs.
