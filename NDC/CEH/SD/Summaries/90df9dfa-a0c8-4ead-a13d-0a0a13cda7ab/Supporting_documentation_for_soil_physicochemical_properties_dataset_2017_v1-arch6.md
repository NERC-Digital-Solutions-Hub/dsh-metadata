- How to use the data
  - Assess treatment effects on soil physicochemical properties by depth and over time (T1 vs T2).
  - Compare effects of digestate, including with nitrification inhibitor, against control.
  - Examine relationships among chemical, biological (MBC/MBN), and physical (texture, aggregates) properties.
  - Integrate with other CINAg datasets for broader analyses of soil health and nutrient dynamics following organic fertilizer applications.

- Data quality and notes
  - The dataset is structured with explicit column headers describing the variable and units.
  - Missing data and formatting should be checked in preparation for analysis; ensure date formats and depth categorizations are consistent.
  - The documentation provides the data structure mapping to facilitate joining with other supporting CINAg data series.
