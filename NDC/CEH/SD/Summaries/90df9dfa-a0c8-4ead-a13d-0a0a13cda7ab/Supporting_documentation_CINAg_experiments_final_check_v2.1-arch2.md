# Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy Supporting documentation for data

## Aim and scope
- Develop data-driven indicators of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and combine them with real-time physical/chemical soil metrics to assess soil health and guide sustainable crop production.
- Use these indicators in on-field experiments and farm platforms to support sustainable intensification.
- Translate findings to Chinese farmers via the Science and Technology Backyard model.
- Structure: WP1 (N cycling fundamentals), WP2 (novel N technologies), WP3 (improved agronomic practices), WP4 (predictive capacity and knowledge exchange).

## Project and participating organizations
- Core collaboration among UK institutions: Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), Rothamsted Research, Bangor University, Bangor CEH, and partner universities.
- New addresses for some collaborators in Spain and the UK.
- Project webpage: www.rothamsted.ac.uk/international/china/cinag
- Publications arising from the datasets include assessments of fertiliser types on grassland and digestate processing for nitrogen loss mitigation.

## Experimental platforms and UK-wide sites
- Four UK farm platforms for 2016–2017 experiments: North Wyke (NW), Harpenden (HA), Henfaes Farm (HF), Easter Bush (EB).
  - Locations: NW (Devon), HA (Herefordshire), HF (North Wales), EB (Edinburgh area).
  - 2016 inorganic fertiliser experiments on grassland; 2017 digestate experiments on winter wheat; 2017 additional grassland trials at EB and HA.
- 2018 UK-wide soil sampling across nine sites with at least two land uses per site (Scotland, Wales, England), including Parsonage Down, Silwood, Harpenden, Broadbalk, Park Grass, and others.
- Site characteristics captured: soil type, texture, mean annual temperature, and mean annual precipitation.

## Meteorological and site data
- NW and HF: daily rainfall and daily mean/min/max temperatures; soil moisture sensors for water-filled pore space (WFPS) at shallow depth.
- EB: soil temperature and WFPS measured with handheld probes; long-term data from the Easter Bush measurement station (air temperature, soil temperature, rainfall at 30-min intervals).

## Experimental design and treatments
- 2016 inorganic fertiliser experiments (grass): complete randomized block design at NW, HF, EB with four treatments plus controls.
  - Treatments: Urea (U), Urea with urease inhibitor (IU), Ammonium nitrate (AN), Control.
  - All plots received P, K, S per guidelines; plots subdivided for NH3 flux, N2O flux, and biomass yield/quality measurements.
  - EB 2016 had different subplot dimensions; EB 2017 used a 20 m x 20 m grid with random treatment allocation.
- 2017 digestate experiment (winter wheat): complete randomized block design at NW and HF with five replicates per digestate treatment and a control; treatments included: Digestate (Dig), Digestate + DMPP (nitrification inhibitor), Acidified digestate (Dig+Acid), Acidified digestate + DMPP, Control.
  - Target N application rate: 190 kg N ha-1 as digestate; applications occurred in March–April 2017.
- 2018 UK-wide sampling: soil and aboveground biomass measurements across nine sites with varying land uses.

## Protocols and data processing
- Distinct sampling protocols for WP1 (soil/plant metrics linked to fertiliser events) and WP2 (treatment-specific measurements) with standardized scheduling and harvests.
- Yields and biomass measurements:
  - Grass: dry matter yields (t ha-1), crude protein, metabolisable energy, fibre metrics, and digestibility (D value); harvests aligned to plant peak biomass.
  - Winter wheat: grain and straw yields, moisture content, and total N; NUEc (crop NUE) and NUEg (grain NUE) calculations.
- Nitrogen metrics:
  - Nitrogen content in herbage derived from crude protein; N-offtake calculated from yields.
  - NUE equations account for N applied versus uptake in the crop versus controls.
- Greenhouse gases:
  - Ammonia (NH3) emissions measured with wind tunnels; flux calculations based on concentration differences, air flow, and trap data; cumulative NH3 emissions computed via area under the curve.
  - N2O emissions measured with static manual and/or automatic chambers; fluxes calculated per chamber method and modeled as cumulative fluxes using a lognormal Bayesian approach (MCMC with JAGS).
  - EB NH3 fluxes estimated using the FIDES inverse dispersion model.
- Soil sampling and analysis (WP1 and WP2):
  - 0–15 cm topsoil and deeper cores collected with standardized corers; samples stored appropriately for subsequent analyses.
  - Soil nitrogen metrics: NH4+, NO3-, amino acids, peptides, mineralisable N; DOC and TDN; DON derived by difference.
  - Soil microbial/biogeochemistry: microbial biomass C and N (MBC/MBN); aggregate size distribution; soil texture; soil moisture and soil organic matter (LOI); pH and electrical conductivity; base cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg); total C and N; total P.
  - P pools: citric acid extractable P, acetic acid extractable P, Olsen-P; P data processed with calibration curves and matrix corrections.
  - DNA and nitrogen-cycle genes: DNA extraction; qPCR for nifH, amoA (AOB/AOA), nirK/nirS, nosZ (I and II), ureC; sequencing for OTUs and microbial diversity; diversity indices (Shannon, Richness).
  - Soil properties: dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) measured in KCl extracts; soil water infiltration and water release curves (HYPRO/WP4 equipment) with modelling for hydraulic parameters.
- QA/QC and data management:
  - Routine QA/QC with standards, blanks, and reference soils; duplicate samples; data validated by multiple team members.
  - Data compilation in Microsoft Excel; LIMS processing for select analyses; cross-site data harmonization to enable integrated analysis.
- Appendices and references:
  - Detailed data tables for fertilizer applications, harvests, and site-specific designs; additional methodological references and model descriptions.

## Key measurements and indicators
- Plant production and quality: yield, protein content, metabolizable energy, fibre metrics, and digestibility.
- Nitrogen dynamics: NUE (crop and grain), N content and offtake in forage or grain, inorganic N in soils (NH4+/NO3−), dissolved organic N, mineralisable N.
- Gas emissions: NH3 and N2O fluxes (spatially and temporally resolved) with cumulative flux estimates.
