# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim
- Maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.

## Scope and governance
- Managed by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
- Future approvals/denials documented; annual reporting of access applications and decision justifications provided to CS partners.
- Reasonable pre-processing support by UKCEH may be provided within CS partnership; other requests handled case-by-case.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for ongoing surveys and informed environmental policy.

## When locations may be released and precision level
- Four-digit grid references (approximate location within 10 km grid) may be released under licence.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) may be released only in very exceptional circumstances, with pre-processing by UKCEH preferred to avoid release.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit references.
- If precise release is considered, the requesting organisation must show that its data/IP protection is equal to or higher than CS data protection.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals for the agreed purpose.
- Licences are finite; data must not be retained after project end; written confirmation of destruction required.
- Data must not be shared with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; not used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same IP confidentiality level as six-digit releases; a clause prevents attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and procedures
- CS data owners decide on exceptional releases; UKCEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, procedures under the Act/Regulations are followed.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual summary of access applications and decision grounds.
- To aid practical use, CS partners are encouraged to consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; collaboration or paid support can be negotiated case-by-case.
- Internal pre-processing support should be prioritized within moderate demand; external requests are assessed individually.
