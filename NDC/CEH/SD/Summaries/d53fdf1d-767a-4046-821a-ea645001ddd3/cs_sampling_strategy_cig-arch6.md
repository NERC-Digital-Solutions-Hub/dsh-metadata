# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the sampling strategy and the ITE Land Classification used to underpin the Countryside Survey (CS) field surveys in Great Britain, from 1978 through 2007.
- Describes how stratified random sampling and environmental land classifications are used to produce national, regional, and country-specific habitat estimates and to enable time-series analysis of change.
- Explains how classifications and sampling were adapted to accommodate devolution (England, Wales, Scotland) and country-specific reporting, including upland habitats.

## Core concepts and methodology
- Stratified sampling basis:
  - The population (GB land) is stratified by ITE Land Classification, which groups land into classes with similar environmental characteristics.
  - Within each class, samples are drawn randomly to ensure representativeness and to avoid bias that could arise from purely simple random sampling.
- Unit and framework:
  - Field sampling uses 1 km square units; early approach focused on central squares with surrounding squares allocated to each classification to capture local variability.
  - Data collected from squares (habitat, vegetation, land use, etc.) are used to estimate national and class-level characteristics.
- National estimates:
  - Estimates of habitat areas are derived by multiplying the mean habitat area per square within a class by the total area of that class, then aggregating across classes.
- Data products:
  - Land Classification maps, class-specific summaries, and time-series habitat estimates underpin policy-relevant reporting and ecological assessments.

## Timeline of key developments
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey):
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to define 32 land classes from data across 1228 central 1 km squares.
  - Eight samples per land class (256 squares total) for national estimates.
- 1984 (Second Field Survey):
  - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - National estimates still anchored to the 1978 Land Classification.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey):
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; urban/sea corrections added.
  - 508 squares surveyed; results used for CS1990; land cover mapping linked (First Land Cover Map of GB).
  - Leads to integration of a more comprehensive GB-wide classification for regional/local estimates.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification for CS1990 → CS1998):
  - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; framework adjusted to improve regional reporting (notably Scotland).
- 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000, CS2000):
  - Emphasis on separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); land classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating 40 strata).
  - Additional squares allocated to ensure representation of new or altered classes; introduction of upland habitat module for England and Wales to improve upland estimates.
  - Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country; Isle of Man samples removed from country estimates.
- 2007 (Countryside Survey 2007, CS2007):
  - Wales-only reporting further formalized; five Welsh sub-classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to reflect country-specific conditions.
  - 45 strata (up from 40); 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure minimum representation; some English classes reduced to maintain balance.
  - Revised country maps and sampling framework to support Wales-focused reporting while maintaining England/Scotland comparability.

## Sampling design specifics and data handling
- Stratification and representation:
  - The ITE Land Classification forms the backbone of stratification to capture ecological and geographical variation across GB.
  - Countries are treated as distinct reporting units (England with Wales, Scotland) with class sub-divisions and occasional aggregations to maintain adequate sample sizes per country.
- Sample allocation and growth:
  - Early surveys used around eight squares per Land Class; later surveys increased per-class sampling (e.g., CS2000 and CS2007) to improve precision, particularly for country-specific estimates.
  - Wales required additional sampling and sub-classifications to enable Wales-only reporting; adjustments made to class definitions and allocations to maintain balanced representation.
- Handling changes in classification:
  - Changing the Land Classification across surveys affects the comparability of national estimates.
  - Prefers using the latest classification for country estimates within a survey period, but recognizes cross-survey consistency benefits when using the original 1990 classification for national estimates.
- Data outputs and representation:
  - Tables and figures (e.g., sample-square counts by class and country) accompany the reports.
  - Data support for national, regional, and country-level habitat area estimates, with explicit notes on data comparability and classification versions.

## Country reporting and upland focus
- England, Wales, Scotland:
  - The sampling framework evolved to support England & Wales and Scotland country units, with targeted sub-divisions and aggregations to ensure robust estimates per country.
  Wales received particular emphasis from CS2000 onward, including Welsh-only sub-classes and a dedicated upland habitat module in the CS2000 plan.
- Upland habitats:
  - An additional module in CS2000 placed more sampling emphasis in upland and marginal upland areas to improve habitat estimates where reporting is country-specific.

## Data products and practical implications for data support
- Potential data products:
  - Time-series dashboards showing habitat area by Land Classification class and by country, with clear metadata on the classification version used per survey.
  - Change-detection reports highlighting shifts in class-area or habitat extent across CS surveys.
  - Exportable datasets of class definitions, sample-square allocations, and habitat estimates by class, year, and country.
  - Maps and shapefiles of revised Land Classification frameworks for each survey year, including Wales- and Scotland-specific versions.
- Considerations for data integration:
  - When aggregating across CS years, align classification versions to maintain comparability.
  - Document country-unit reporting adjustments (e.g., Wales-specific classes) to avoid misinterpretation of trends.
  - Maintain linkage between Land Classification results and habitat estimates to support reproducibility of annual national estimates.

## Challenges and considerations highlighted
- Representativeness and data balance:
  - Ensuring adequate representation of all land classes, especially after classification splits for country reporting (notably Wales), required additional squares and class subdivisions.
- Comparability across years:
  - Changes in Land Classification between surveys create challenges for year-to-year comparisons; careful handling of classification version is essential.
- Devolution and reporting needs:
  - Growing demand for country-specific results necessitated subdivision and reallocation of samples, with trade-offs in precision for some classes.
- Outputs and dissemination:
  - Emphasis on producing self-explanatory outputs (maps, class-level summaries, and habitat estimates) to support policy and public reporting, while acknowledging potential limitations in cross-year consistency.
