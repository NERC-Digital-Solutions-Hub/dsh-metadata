# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy used by Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification, a stratified framework to ensure representative sampling of Great Britain’s countryside.
  - Combines stratified random sampling with standardized field data collection (vegetation, soils, land cover, habitats) to enable national, regional, and country-specific estimates.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified sampling: divide land into discrete strata (ITE Land Classes) to reduce bias and improve representativeness.
  - ITE Land Classification origins: initiated in the 1970s, using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to classify land into 32 classes, with quadrat-based vegetation data adapted to 1 km square sampling.
  - Use of Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) in early development to group land into classes; subsequent revisions expanded the classification and its geographical applicability.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification
  - 1978 (initial land classification): 32 classes derived from 1 km squares classified from a 15 x 15 km grid (center squares) with surrounding squares allocated to classes; 6039 km² represented; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class).
  - 1984: sampling expanded to 384 squares (12 per class) to support land-use and habitat mapping; results published later.
  - 1990: all GB squares reclassified; land-cover mapping integrated; 508 squares surveyed; original 1984 data revisited; CS1990 results published in 1993.
  - 1998/CS2000: land classification updated to allow Scotland-only reporting; class count increased to 40; separate country estimates introduced; new squares added to rebalance representation; a dedicated upland module was planned/implemented for England and Wales.
  - 2007/CS2007: Wales-only reporting necessitated further adjustments; land classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating additional Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares added; some English class counts adjusted due to Welsh subdivisions; a revised England-Wales/Scotland framework is used for sampling maps and estimates.

- Survey-by-survey framework and sampling scales
  - CS1978: base framework with 256 squares (8 per class) across 32 classes; national estimates computed from mean habitat area per class times land-class area.
  - CS1984: increased sampling to 384 squares (12 per class); continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - CS1990: all GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; addition of land-cover mapping; results published in CS1990 main report (1993).
  - CS2000: formal introduction of separate country estimates; 40 strata; class sub-divisions into country units; 19 additional squares to ensure adequate representation; upland habitat module added to improve accuracy for upland estimates.
  - CS2007: Welsh-specific reporting drive; creation of 5 new Welsh sub-classes; 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation; some English class counts reduced but deemed to have acceptable precision; Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country in relative terms; upland module continues to support England and Wales estimates.

- Separate country estimates and data governance implications
  - Country-level estimates require country-specific stratification and sampling (England with Wales, Scotland separately).
  - Classification changes impact comparability of national estimates across surveys; guidance favors using the latest classification for consistency within a survey while noting cross-survey comparability challenges.
  - Documentation of land-class version, class definitions, and sampling configurations is essential for data stewardship, reproducibility, and user understanding.

- Upland module and additional data collection
  - CS2000 included an upland/marginal upland module (30 extra squares) to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
  - This supports more robust country-based reporting for upland habitats.

- Outputs, references, and data provenance
  - Across surveys, outputs include land-class maps, stratified sample square lists, and habitat/land-use statistics used for national and country-specific environmental reporting.
  - Notable notes emphasize the need for consistent national estimates while accommodating evolving land-class frameworks; changes are documented to maintain traceability and data usability.

- Practical implications for data stewards and governance
  - Maintain detailed metadata on land-class definitions, versioning, and country-unit subdivisions.
  - Ensure dataset schemas capture class codes, country assignments, sample-square identifiers, and upland module flags.
  - Provide provenance trails linking national estimates to the corresponding land-class framework and survey year.
  - Communicate changes in classification and sampling design to data users to preserve interpretability and comparability across time.
