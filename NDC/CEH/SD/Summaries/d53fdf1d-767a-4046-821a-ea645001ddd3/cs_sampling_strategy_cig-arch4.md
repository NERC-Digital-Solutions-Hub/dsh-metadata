The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007 and how it evolved from the ITE Land Classification.
- Emphasizes a time-series approach to detect ecological and habitat change across Great Britain.
- Links sampling design to a layered land-classification framework to ensure representative, stratified sampling.

## Core concepts for data strategy
- Stratified random sampling to avoid bias and ensure all parts of the landscape are represented.
- Use of ITE Land Classification as the primary stratification framework, based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- 1 km square sampling units, with a central square plus surrounding squares to build the classified framework.
- National estimates derived from class-level means and land-class areas; aims for comparability across surveys.

## Evolution of the Land Classification and Sampling Framework

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid).
  - Classified 6039 squares (centre plus surrounding) and surveyed 256 squares (8 per class).
  - National habitat estimates calculated from mean habitat area per square within each class.

- 1984 – Second field survey
  - Sampling increased to 12 km squares per land class (384 total), expanding coverage.
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey
  - Land Classification updated to classify every 1 km square in GB; urban/seA corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; full data collection repeated for existing features plus initial vegetation quadrats.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification and fourth field survey
  - Classification extended to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
  - Results published in CS1990 follow-ups and related analyses.

- 2000 – Developments for Countryside Survey CS2000
  - Move toward separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) with country-specific reporting.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata expanded to 40–45 depending on subdivision and aggregation.
  - Additional 19–43 squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new classes, with targeted distribution across England, Wales, and Scotland.
  - An uplands module added to improve habitat estimates for upland areas in England and Wales.

- 2007 – Developments for Countryside Survey CS2007 (Welsh-only reporting)
  - Wales designated for country-specific reporting; Wales sampling increased to 6+ squares per Welsh class (5 new Welsh classes created: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Framework expanded to 45 strata; 43 extra Welsh squares added; England did not receive additional Welsh squares in compensation (some English classes remained with 4 squares).
  - Revised land-class maps issued for England with Wales and for Scotland to reflect country-specific reporting needs.

## Sampling design and data balance

- Stratification and sampling
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representation across diverse land forms and uses.
  - 1 km squares as the basic sampling unit; centre square plus surrounding squares used to define and assign land classes.
- Class numbers and representation
  - 32 original classes (1978) expanded over time to 40, then further refined for country-specific reporting (up to 45 strata/land classes).
  - Additional squares were allocated to address under-representation in newer classes and to ensure robust country-level estimates.
- Country-specific reporting
  - CS2000 introduced separate country-unit estimates; classes subdivided by country (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w for Wales).
  - Aggregation rules applied where a country had very few squares in a class to maintain stable estimates.
- Uplands module
  - Dedicated sampling to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Data quality, comparability, and interpretation

- Representativeness and precision
  - The sampling framework aims to minimize bias and ensure representative coverage across GB landscape types.
  - Under- or over-representation of certain land classes addressed by subdividing classes and adding targeted sample squares.
- Reclassification and continuity
  - Reclassification of squares across survey iterations can affect comparability; chosen approaches aim to balance within-survey consistency with cross-survey comparability.
  - The 2006 scoping study notes that switching land-class schemes affects large-scale stock estimates; recommendations favor using the latest classification for within-survey estimates and the original for cross-survey comparability.
- National estimates
  - National habitat estimates are derived from class means and land-class areas; transparency about classification changes is essential for interpretation.
- Documentation and references
  - Extensive documentation accompanies the methodology, including historical appendices and a broad bibliography to support methods and interpretation.

## Appendix (brief history)
- Appendix I provides a condensed history of the ITE Land Classification and its application to successive Countryside Surveys, outlining the progression from 32 to 40–45 classes and the evolution in sampling strategy across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
