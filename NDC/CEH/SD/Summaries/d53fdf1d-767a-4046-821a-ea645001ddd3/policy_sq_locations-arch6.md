# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.

## Background and governance
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE National Capability (award NE/R016429/1).
- Original CS partners: NERC (via UKCEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys, environmental integrity, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality is in the public interest; requests are handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify which 10 km × 10 km grid square a CS square falls in.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references require pre-processing analysis by UKCEH; in very exceptional cases, external release under licence may be allowed if the requester demonstrates that their data/IP carries equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality considerations and follow the same exceptional-terms framework as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release (licence terms)
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration and for specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality level; license terms prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and processing
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Decisions, including grounds, are documented and reported annually to CS partners.
- UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- CS partners and other potential users are encouraged to consult UKCEH before committing to data use; UKCEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for users
- Consult UKCEH early to help define requirements and determine appropriate level of data access and support.
- Understand that approvals, licences, and potential UKCEH involvement depend on case-specific risk and confidentiality considerations.
