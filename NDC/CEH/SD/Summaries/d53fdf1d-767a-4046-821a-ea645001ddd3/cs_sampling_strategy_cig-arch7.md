# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Outlines the sampling framework and land classification system underpinning Countryside Survey field surveys through 2007.
  - Connects long-term time-series data with its ITE Land Classification origins, emphasizing comparability across surveys.

- Core concept: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling
  - Uses a stratified, random sampling design to ensure samples represent the landscape’s ecological and land-use variation.
  - The Land Classification groups land into defined classes (initially 32, later expanded) based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate).
  - Field sampling unit is a 1 km square; Centre square selected within a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares classified to assign class for each sampled site.
  - Eight samples per class in CS1978; later surveys increased to 12 per class (CS1984) and then adjustments for all-squares classification (CS1990).

- Timeline of the sampling framework and land classification evolution
  - 1978 (Initial): 32 ITE Land Classes; sampled 256 squares (8 per class) using centre-square approach.
  - 1984 (Second land-use survey): sampling increased to 12 squares per class (total 384); continued use of original 32 classes.
  - 1990 (All Squares land classification; CS1990): classification revised to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; linked with Land Cover Map from satellite imagery; results published in CS1990 main report.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; CS1990 updated): GB-wide classification expanded to 40 classes; groundwork laid for Scotland-only reporting.
  - 2000 (CS2000): introduced country-unit estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland) through sub-division and aggregation of Land Classes; added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation; upland habitat module added for better England/Wales upland estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Welsh-only reporting requirements prompted further refinements; created country-unit versions for several classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); increased Wales sampling to guarantee minimum representation; some English classes (5e, 15e) reduced to four squares per class due to balance considerations; overall extension to 45 strata.

- Separate country estimates and Wales-specific developments
  - CS2000 changes enabled reporting by country units (England with Wales; Scotland) by subdividing/aggregating Land Classes and adjusting sampling to maintain representation.
  - Wales received a focus in sampling; dedicated Welsh classes introduced (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); additional Welsh squares added to ensure at least six squares per Welsh class.
  - England/Wales adjustments did not always warrant increasing English squares; some classes in England retained relatively small sample counts but judged adequate for reporting purposes.

- Upland and habitat-focused enhancements
  - CS2000 included an uplands module to improve statistical precision for upland habitats in England and Wales, addressing under-sampling due to country-based reporting needs.

- National estimates and data consistency
  - National estimates are calculated using class-level means multiplied by class area, based on the Land Classification.
  - Changing land classifications across surveys can affect the comparability of stock estimates; a 2006 scoping study notes that consistency favors using the latest classification for within-survey estimates, while 1990-style classifications are more consistent across surveys.
  - The document provides cross-walks and notes on how to compare estimates when classification schemes change.

- Outputs and references
  - Each survey (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) produced main reports detailing methodology and habitat estimates.
  - The document includes extensive bibliographic references and an appendix outlining the historical development of the ITE Land Classification.

- Practical implications for GIS and map-based data products
  - Land Class maps underpin spatial stratification and sampling design, facilitating geospatial modeling and change detection over time.
  - The shift to country-unit classifications and Wales-focused classes affects how GIS analysts aggregate or disaggregate habitat estimates by country.
  - Upland and Wales-specific modules add targeted spatial data layers for more precise country-level and habitat-specific analyses.
  - When using multi-era datasets, careful alignment of classifications or cross-walks is essential to maintain comparability of spatial estimates across surveys.
