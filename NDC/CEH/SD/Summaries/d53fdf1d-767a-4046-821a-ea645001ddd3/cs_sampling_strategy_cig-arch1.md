# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Describes the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify field samples for Countryside Survey from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes building a time-series capable sampling framework that is linked to landscape classification and habitat/dataset estimation across Great Britain.
- Core method: stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation; field surveys conducted on 1 km squares, with additional surrounding areas.

## Core Concepts
- Stratified sampling to avoid bias and ensure representation across different land types and ecological processes.
- Land Classification (ITE Land Classification) basis for strata, linking environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to ecological differences.
- Field sampling units evolved from 1 km squares (center of 15×15 km grids) to more expansive integration as data and computing capabilities expanded.
- National estimates are derived by combining class-level habitat metrics with the total area of each land class.

## Development Timeline and Key Changes

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification and First Field Survey
- ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data of 1 km squares (centre squares of 15×15 km grid from GB).
- Surrounding four squares per centre square also classified, giving a total of 6040 squares classified conceptually; practical survey focused on 8 km squares per land class.
- 256 squares surveyed nationally (8 per class) to estimate habitat areas by class.

### 1984 – Second Field Survey
- Sampling increased within each class: 12 km squares per land class (total 384).
- Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- Change statistics between 1978 and 1984 published.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990) and Third Field Survey
- Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB (all 1 km squares) using surrogates for climate, geology, etc.
- 508 squares surveyed; repeat measurements of earlier vegetation data and habitat mapping included.
- Satellite-derived Land Cover Map linked to programme.
- Result: 62% correspondence with original 1978 classes; some squares reclassified, affecting representation in subsequent analyses.

### 2000 – Developments for CS2000 (Separate Country Estimates)
- Need to produce separate England & Wales versus Scotland estimates; some classes under-represented under the all-squares approach.
- Major changes:
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions (creating 40 strata from 32).
  - Class aggregation in countries to maintain representation.
  - Additional squares added (19) to ensure adequate representation of new classes; further 11 squares allocated to balance England vs Wales sampling.
  - Wales-specific sub-division of Land Class 17 to refine Wales results.
  - Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates; replaced with new England squares.
- An uplands module added to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.

## Wales and Uplands Focus (CS2000)
- Wales received targeted sampling and later Wales-only reporting considerations.
- Uplands module added to improve precision for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## CS2007 – Wales-Only Reporting Adjustments
- Wales required dedicated Wales-only results after devolution and policy needs.
- Welsh-Land Classes refined into five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w (in addition to 40 previous strata, total 45).
- 43 additional Welsh squares allocated; minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class.
- Some English classes (5e, 15e) reduced to 4 squares, deemed acceptable per scoping studies; no additional Welsh English compensation.
- England- and Scotland-focused sampling maps updated accordingly.

## Outputs and Representation
- Tables and figures illustrate sample distribution and land-class maps across years (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
- CS2007 table (Table 3) summarizes the numbers of sample squares by class and country; maps (Figures 4–7) visualize revised land classes and sampled squares.
- Note on national estimates: Changing classifications across surveys affects cross-survey consistency; preference for current classification when reporting country-level estimates, but historic consistency considerations are acknowledged.

## National Estimates and Methodological Notes
- National estimates are produced by combining mean habitat per square within each Land Class with the total area of that class.
- The 2006 scoping study discusses implications of changing land classifications for consistency of GB estimates.
- Table 4 provides historical numbers of squares per class under the Original (1990) Land Classification for comparison across surveys.

## Key Takeaways for Data-Driven Analysis
- The Countryside Survey employs a robust, evolving land-class stratification system to enable time-series ecological estimates at national and country levels.
- Stratified random sampling within land classes mitigates bias and supports change detection across decades.
- Adaptations to sampling frameworks reflect policy needs (e.g., country-specific reporting for England/Wales and Scotland) and evolving data capabilities (e.g., all-squares classification, upland modules, and Wales-specific subdivisions).
- Data outputs are designed to be compatible with spatial datasets (e.g., Land Cover Maps) and allow calculation of national estimates by combining class-area with mean square values.
