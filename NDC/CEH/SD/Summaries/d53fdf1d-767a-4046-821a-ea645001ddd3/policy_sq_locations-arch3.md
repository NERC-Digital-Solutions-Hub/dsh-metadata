# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview and scope
- Aims to maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Program funding: 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE.
- 2007 CS partners include NERC (through CEH), Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Confidentiality protects representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners, which are essential for survey integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest justification for confidentiality; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release standards
- Location release depends on level of precision and approved purpose:
  - Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify the 10 km x 10 km grid containing each CS square.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations): released only if UKCEH can perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing precise locations; exceptional external release considered only if necessary and with strong confidentiality protections.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps): could be used to identify square locations and is subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit data.
- Very exceptional circumstances: external release may occur if the requesting organization demonstrates in legal terms that its IP data has equal or higher confidentiality/protection than CS data, preventing sharing with UKCEH for processing.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must:
  - Preserve confidentiality; store data securely; restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Obtain licences for finite periods tied to specific projects; destroy data at project end; no retention for other duties.
  - Not release data to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
  - Not use data to plan visits to CS squares or check landowner compliance.
  - Provide evidence of project management standards (at least equivalent to JCOP) if required.
  - For four-digit releases, follow similar licensing terms but without the higher IP confidentiality requirements; prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations.
- Licences and approvals are issued by UKCEH on behalf of NERC; annual CS partner reports will outline applications and decisions.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CS data ownership and decision-making on exceptional releases rest with UKCEH, applying stated principles.
- UKCEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate confidentiality clauses; licences require sign-off by a senior authorised official.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH will follow FOI/EIR procedures to support the decision.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report on access requests and decision grounds.
- For internal CS partnership use, UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within feasible timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
- Recommendation to consult with UKCEH before committing to using CS location data; collaboration or payment arrangements may be negotiated.
