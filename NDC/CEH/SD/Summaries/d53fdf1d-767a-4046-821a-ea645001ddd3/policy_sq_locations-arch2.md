# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Purpose: maximise public interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Programme and partners: 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (UK-SCaPE National Capability); original partners include NERC, CEH (UKCEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and ongoing access to survey land.
- Requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations can be released (and precision levels)
- Allowed releases (with licences):
  - Four-digit grid references (identifies 10 km x 10 km grid square) may be released under licence to support approximate location awareness.
- More precise releases:
  - Six-digit grid references (precise location) are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must be pre-processed by UKCEH to avoid need for release, or the requester must demonstrate that their data/IP is equally or more confidential than CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, linear features) could identify a square and are subject to the same exceptional-circumstances requirements as six-digit data.
- Licences for four-digit releases have specific terms to prevent locating exact squares.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensee obligations:
  - Preserve confidentiality; store data securely; restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project need.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
  - End of licence period: confirm in writing that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
  - No disclosure to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult UKCEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit vs six-digit terms:
  - Four-digit releases have license terms similar to six-digit but do not require the highest IP confidentiality level.
  - A clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from the released data.

## Responsibilities and process
- Decision-making:
  - UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions according to this policy.
  - UKCEH issues hardcopy licences and ensures clauses reflect policy; licences require sign-off from an authorised senior person.
  - If approval is denied, UKCEH follows FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
- Reporting and support:
  - UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - Approvals require reasonable expectation that UKCEH can perform necessary pre-processing within a reasonable timeframe; moderate demand considered.
  - Requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Guidance for users:
  - CS partner organisations and potential data users are strongly advised to consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data.
  - UKCEH involvement may vary (collaborative effort or paid); arrangements negotiated case-by-case.
