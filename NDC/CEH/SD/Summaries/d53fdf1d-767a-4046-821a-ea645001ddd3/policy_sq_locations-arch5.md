# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to CS survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Rolling program funded by NERC; key organisations involved include UKCEH, Defra, NE, devolved administrations, and other CS partners.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, environmental policy relevance, and permission to survey land.

## When and how locations may be released
- Approximate locations (identify if squares fall within predefined areas) can be released using four-digit grid references (10 km x 10 km grid).
- Precise six-digit grid references require pre-processing analysis by UKCEH to avoid release; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases, location data may be released under licence if the requester proves IP data has equivalent or higher confidentiality needs.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry the same confidentiality considerations and may be released under the same exceptional terms.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project access.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- Upon licence end, licensees must confirm data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; use must not facilitate visits or landowner compliance checks.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same IP confidentiality level; license terms include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Licensing and responsibilities
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences.
- Licences must be signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee organization.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH supports the decision under Act and Regulations procedures.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe for CS partners; requests from other organizations are case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult with UKCEH before using data; UKCEH may assist as part of collaboration or for paid support, negotiated case-by-case.

## Engagement and governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Emphasises strong data governance around restricted location data, licensing, and secure handling.
- Supports documenting and justifying data releases, processing steps, and destruction confirmations.
- Highlights the need for standardized pre-processing to avoid unnecessary disclosure while enabling legitimate research.
- Encourages collaboration with a scientific lead at UKCEH to define requirements and support appropriate use.
- Stresses public-interest balance: data utility for policy and research versus confidentiality and future survey integrity.
