# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk of compromising future surveys and site anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Funded for 2018/2019–2024 by NERC as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for ongoing surveys, environmental protection, and permissions.
  - Public-interest rationale; handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI and Environmental Information Regulations.

- When and how locations can be released
  - Approximate locations: four-digit grid references (10 km × 10 km grid) released under licence.
  - Precise locations: six-digit grid references released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; UKCEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality; released under same exceptional terms.

- Conditions of release
  - Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate needs.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed upon licence end.
  - No release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; not to inform or plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
  - May require evidence of JCOP-equivalent project-management standards for licensees.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP requirements than six-digit releases; license clauses prohibit attempting to derive precise locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides exceptional releases and issues licences; signs licences with authorised individuals.
  - If approval is denied, decision supported by FOI/Regulations procedures.
  - UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications and decision grounds.
  - To support practical use, UKCEH may assist with pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframe; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to CS location data use; collaboration or payment arrangements may apply.

- Practical guidance for data leaders
  - Align access controls with data governance: minimise exposure, require secure handling, and enforce finite licensing.
  - Consider pre-processing options to reduce need for releasing precise locations.
  - Maintain clear documentation of licensing terms, data handling, and destruction confirmations.
  - Engage with UKCEH early to define requirements and potential support.
