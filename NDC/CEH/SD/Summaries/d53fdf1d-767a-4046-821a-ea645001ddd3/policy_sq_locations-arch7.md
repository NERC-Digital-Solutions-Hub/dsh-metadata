# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Sets rules for access to CS survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Public access applies to all CS data except survey square locations and interior square spatial data.

## Scope and governance
- Funded for 2018/2019–2024 by NERC (UK-SCaPE National Capability).
- CS partners include UKCEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.
- UKCEH decides on exceptional releases under the policy and issues licences; annual reporting to CS partners.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Location data kept confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects the integrity of the sampling strategy, environment, and future access permissions.
- Requests for information handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations can be released
- General access: identify if survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) using approximate locations.
- Four-digit grid references (10 km x 10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references (precise) require UKCEH processing to avoid disclosure; in very exceptional cases, may be released externally under licence if the requester demonstrates that their data are equally or more confidential than CS data.
- Spatial data from inside squares (habitats, linear features) can potentially identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit coordinates.
- Four-digit releases have a less stringent IP/confidentiality threshold than six-digit releases, with licensing terms reflecting this difference.
- A clause in licensing prevents users from attempting to derive precise square locations or asserting they have done so.

## Release conditions and data handling
- Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and access-restricted to authorized individuals for the project.
- Licences are finite; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities after the project ends.
- End-of-licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and were destroyed.
- Data must not be shared with third parties in ways that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- For four-digit releases, IP confidentiality criteria are less stringent than for six-digit releases; users must not derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities and administration
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report summarising licence applications and decision grounds.
- UKCEH aims to support internal processing needs within the CS partnership; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partnership organisations are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data.
- UKCEH may provide scientific support as part of collaboration or for a negotiated fee.

## Practical implications for GIS Specialists
- Access to precise square locations is tightly controlled; four-digit releases are possible under licence, while six-digit releases require exceptional justification.
- For project planning, consider using four-digit data and processed analyses to avoid needing exact locations.
- Pre-processing analysis by UKCEH is preferred before external release to minimise disclosure risks.
- Ensure strict data governance: secure storage, restricted access, finite licensing periods, and post-project destruction.
- Engage with UKCEH early to define requirements, potential data processing, and licensing feasibility.
