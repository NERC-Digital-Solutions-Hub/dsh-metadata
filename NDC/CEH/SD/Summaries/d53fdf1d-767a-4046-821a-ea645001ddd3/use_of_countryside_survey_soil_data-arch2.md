# Sampling design

## Purpose and scope
- Countryside Survey (CS) soil sampling occurred in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019, with a rolling approach starting in 2019 to measure about 100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
- Power analyses (Emmett et al. 2008) guided the number of samples needed to detect significant change.
- A pilot survey occurred in 2018; the rolling survey aims to monitor trends over time.

## Sampling frame and plot layout
- Soils are sampled from CS X-plots, with five X-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differences in land use and soil types.
- Some plots are relocated over time due to destruction, access denial, or uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) referring to square 2, repeat plot 1.
- The location typically remains within a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot, with samples taken about 2–3 m from the original corners.

## Field sampling methods and depth
- Soils are collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples); 1998, 2007, and the rolling 2018/2019–2023 survey use soil cores. In 1978 a soil pit was used to access the top 15 cm.
- In some plots, full 15 cm depth isn’t achievable due to stones or shallow soils.
- In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were made for 2 of the 4 cores sampled.
- The rolling CS survey adopted the core-based sampling method.

## Measurements and laboratory processing
- 1978: laboratory measurements were limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1998, 2007, and rolling survey: multiple cores were taken per X-plot; different cores have different measurements.
- Bulk density measurements occurred in 2007 and again in 2018/19–2023, but not via the ISO whole-core bulk density method.
- Samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements, and no chemical analyses are performed by soil horizon.
- In 2007, some measurements were not conducted on all samples; core photos and measurements were taken on selected cores (two of the four).
- A detailed methods report is available (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Statistical analysis and data interpretation
- Analyses should consider the CS structure and land-class effects; ignoring land class can yield stock/change of the population rather than national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not consistently used; a mixed-model approach with square as a random factor is recommended to account for up to five X-plots within each square.
- CS design emphasizes dispersed observations; only one core per location is typical, but widespread sampling improves regional precision.
- For regional estimates, design-based approaches with dispersed sampling are advised.
- Users should consult UKCEH prior to analysis and interpretation and review CS publications for context (listed on the CS website).

## Data management and references
- Key references: Emmett et al. 2007 (method development, power analyses, protocols) and Emmett et al. 2008 (Countryside Survey Soils 2007 report).
- The dataset involves multiple years with varying measurements and sampling coverage; users should verify year-specific methodologies when analyzing data.

## Practical implications for analysts
- Expect non-uniform measurement coverage across years and plots; verify which measurements exist for each core/year.
- Account for non-replicate X-plots and potential relocation when aggregating data.
- Apply mixed-model approaches with square as a random factor to reflect the hierarchical sampling structure.
- Consider land-class structure to produce national estimates rather than unweighted population stocks.
