# Countryside Survey Soils

- Purpose and scope
  - Long-term environmental health monitoring of soils to inform policy scrutiny, evaluation, and future decisions.
  - Rolling survey aims to measure ~100 squares each year for five years before repeating, following pilot in 2018.

- Sampling design
  - Historical sampling years: 1978, 1998, 2007; rolling survey began in 2019.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to 591 CS squares.
  - Power analyses conducted to determine sample sizes needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Soils sampled from CS X-plots within each CS square; 5 X-plots per square.
  - X-plots are not replicates; they may represent different land uses and soil types.
  - Some plots relocated over time due to destruction, access permission, or uncertainty in original location.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating square, repeat plot, and position; eventual sampling around a permanently marked 2 m x 2 m plot.
  - Exact sampling points shift ~2–3 m within the plot area as needed.

- Sampling method
  - Top 15 cm of soil sampled (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998/2007/rolling survey use hammered soil cores; samples extracted from cores.
  - 1978 used a soil pit to access top 15 cm.
  - Stone-rich or shallow soils can prevent full 15 cm core collection.
  - Core photographs and dimensions were recorded in 2007 for some cores; rolling survey adopted this approach.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978 laboratory measurements: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990: partial soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998/2007/rolling: multiple cores per X-plot; different cores yield different measurements.
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and in 2018/19–2023; not using ISO bulk density method.
  - Full methodological implications and descriptions provided in Emmett et al. 2008.

- Statistical analysis and interpretation
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock/change of the population rather than national estimates.
  - If land classes are included, results are weighted to yield national estimates of stock and change.
  - Bootstrapping not consistently applied in soil data analyses.
  - Recommend a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for multiple X-plots per CS square.
  - For CS-style designs, spatial structure is not the primary interest; a dispersed observation strategy can improve precision and regional coverage when estimates are required.
  - Users are advised to consult UKCEH before analysis and interpretation and to review publications that already exploit the data.
