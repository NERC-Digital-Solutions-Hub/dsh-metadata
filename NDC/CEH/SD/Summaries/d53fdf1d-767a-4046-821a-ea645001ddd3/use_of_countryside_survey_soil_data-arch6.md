# Sampling design

- Overview
  - Soils were sampled in the Countryside Survey (CS) across years 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 sampled all 591 CS squares, but not all measurements were made on all samples.
  - Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).
  - A pilot survey occurred in 2018, with rolling surveying starting in 2019 to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.

- Sample location and repeat structure
  - Soils are sampled from CS X-plots, with 5 X-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to varying land uses, soil types, etc.
  - Some plots are relocated over time due to destruction, access denial, or certainty of original location.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1: square 2, repeat plot 1); samples with the same identifier come from the same location, though exact sampling points are typically 2–3 m apart within a permanently marked 2 m x 2 m plot.

- Sampling procedure
  - Top 15 cm of soil is sampled (8 cm for invertebrate samples) in most years; 1978 used a soil pit for the top 15 cm.
  - In 1998, 2007, and the rolling 2018/2019–2023 survey, soils were collected with a soil core hammered in and pulled out.
  - In some soils, full 15 cm could not be collected due to stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were made in 2007 for selected cores.

- Measurements and lab methods
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1990: some soil mapping occurred.
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling survey: multiple cores per X-plot with different measurements on different cores.
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and in 2018/19–2023, but not using ISO bulk density method due to practical constraints.
  - A detailed description of methods and implications is provided in Emmett et al. (2008).

- Data structure and analysis considerations
  - Statistical analyses should consider the land class structure; ignoring it yields stock/change of the population rather than national estimates weighted by land classes.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses.
  - The CS design typically uses a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for up to five X-plots per square.
  - Unlike some monitoring programs, CS often uses a dispersed set of observations (not a single core per location); this can increase overall precision and regional coverage for estimates.
  - Users are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications listed on the CS website for prior analyses.
