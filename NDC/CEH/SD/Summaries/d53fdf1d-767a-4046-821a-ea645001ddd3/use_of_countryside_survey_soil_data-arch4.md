# Sampling design

- Overview
  - Countryside Survey (CS) soils were sampled in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 sampled all 591 CS squares but not all measurements were made on all samples.
  - Power analyses (Emmett et al. 2008) informed the number of samples needed to detect significant change.
  - A pilot survey occurred in 2018; 2019 marked the start of a rolling survey aiming to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.

- Sampling framework
  - Soils are sampled from CS X-plots, with 5 X-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - X-plots are not replicates; they may represent different land uses or soil types.
  - Some X-plots are relocated due to land use changes, access issues, or uncertainty in original location.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1), referring to square 2, repeat plot 1.
  - Re-sampling occurs within ~2–3 meters of the original 2 m x 2 m permanent plot corners.

- Sample locations and handling
  - Samples from the top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - In 1998, 2007, and the rolling CS survey (2018/19–2023), core sampling was used; in 1978, a soil pit was used.
  - Occasionally full 15 cm cores could not be collected due to stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were recorded in 2007 for some cores.

- Sampling method
  - Rolling survey method established in 2019; methodology evolved from earlier core-based approaches.
  - In some years, only partial core measurements were feasible; homogenisation occurred before pH and LOI analyses.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling survey: multiple cores per X-plot; different cores carry different measurements.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and 2018/19–2023 (but not via ISO whole-core method).
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples are homogenised prior to pH and LOI.
  - 2007 included core photographs and measurements for 2 of the 4 cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).
  - A full description of methods and implications is detailed in Emmett et al. 2008.

- Data quality, structure and analysis guidance
  - Analyses should consider land class structure; ignoring it yields stock/change of the population, while including it yields national estimates weighted by land classes.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used across CS soils data analyses.
  - The CS structure should be accounted for; at minimum, use a mixed model with square as a random factor to reflect multiple X-plots within each square.
  - Design-based approaches (where spatial structure is not the primary interest) benefit from dispersed sampling to improve precision and regional coverage.
  - When using CS data for national or regional estimates, broader sampling design improves precision; advise comparing with existing publications.

- Practical guidance and governance
  - Users should consult UKCEH before analysis and interpretation.
  - Check CS publications that exploit the data, with references listed on the CS website.
