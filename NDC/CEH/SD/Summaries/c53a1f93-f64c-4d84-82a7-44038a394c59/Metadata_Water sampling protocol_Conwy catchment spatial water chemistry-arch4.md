# Routine Conwy carbon catchment water sampling protocol

## Purpose and scope
- Describes routine field sampling of water chemistry for Conwy carbon catchment monitoring.
- Collects both filtered and unfiltered water samples, records in situ measurements (conductivity, temperature, pH), and notes weather/observations.
- Emphasizes sample traceability, proper labeling, and data/office workflow to support data quality and discoverability.

## Equipment
- Fieldsheet and site checklists
- For each sample point:
  - 1 x 500 ml jar
  - 2 x 125 ml jars
  - 1 x 60 ml mason jar
  - Labeling: project name, site name, trip number, date
- Sampling aids: pole sampler, bucket sampler on rope
- Filtration: 0.45 µm, 47 mm cellulose nitrate filter papers; 2 x filters; 2 x syringes (one for salt water, one for freshwater)
- Measurement: mercury thermometer; Hanna meters for pH and EC (HI98130 and HI98129)

## Sampling method
- Rinse 500 ml jar three times with water; fill completely underwater to minimize air bubbles.
- Repeat rinse/fill with 125 ml jar; for hard-to-reach sites use pole/bucket sampler.
- Filter preparation: place fresh filter paper; rinse syringe 3x in water; filter through with 30 ml of water from syringe.
- Rinse 60 ml jar with 30 ml filtered water; fill completely with filtered water, minimizing air.
- Repeat filtering for the second 125 ml jar.
  - Note: if time is limited, filtration can be performed in the laboratory the following day.
- In situ measurements: insert Hanna meters and mercury thermometer into water; record conductivity, temperature, and pH.
- If access is difficult, use bucket sampler to position instruments.
- Maintain one syringe/filter set exclusively for salt water work.
- Record stage board depth at Dolgarrog and Cwm Llanerch; use comments box for weather and other observations (past 24 hours).

## Sample handling and data labeling
- Use two Lancaster sample information sheets (one for filtered, one for unfiltered) with sites, collection date, and batch number.
- Print two copies of each information sheet (yellow and white).
- Pack in a box with all filtered and unfiltered samples (125 ml jars) and yellow information sheets; add packing material to prevent movement.
- Label the box with the trip number using the provided sample box labels.
- Email the Lancaster sample sheets to CHEM@wpo.nerc.ac.uk.

## Office activities and data management
- Update the Conwy monitoring sites and dates Excel spreadsheet with sampling date/time details.
- Photocopy the field sheet and file:
  - Original filed in Dave N's cabinet (Conwy C Catchment field sheets originals)
  - Photocopy filed in the “C Catchment field sheet photocopies” folder
- Prepare Lancaster sample information sheets (filtered and unfiltered) with relevant site, date, and batch number.
- Print two copies of each information sheet (yellow and white).
- Pack into a box as described above; label with trip number.
- Email Lancaster sample sheets accordingly.

## Quality, governance, and data integrity notes
- Ensures clear labeling, sample tracking, and traceability from field to office data systems.
- Supports data discoverability by organizing field sheets, information sheets, and Excel/site tracking records in defined locations.
- Allows for laboratory filtration if field time is constrained, providing flexibility while maintaining data integrity.
