# Routine Conwy carbon catchment water sampling protocol

- Objective: Standard protocol for routine water chemistry sampling in the Conwy carbon catchment to ensure consistent data collection, labeling, and handling for subsequent analysis and data management.
- Version and authorship: Version 1, dated 19/09/2008, authored by Annette Burden.

## Equipment needed
- Fieldsheet (checklist on reverse)
- For each sample point:
  - 1 x 500 ml jar
  - 2 x 125 ml jars
  - 1 x 60 ml mason jar
  - All clearly labelled with project name, site name, trip number, and date
- Sampling aids:
  - Pole sampler (for high flows)
  - Bucket sampler on a rope
- Filtration and preservation:
  - 0.45 µm, 47 mm cellulose nitrate filter papers
  - 2 x filters and 2 x syringes (one each for saltwater and freshwater)
- Instrumentation:
  - Mercury thermometer
  - Hanna Combo pH and EC meters (HI98130 and HI98129)

## Sampling method (where possible)
- Rinse and fill:
  - Rinse the 500 ml mason jar cap and rinse jar 3 times in the water; fill completely with minimal air bubbles (cap underwater if possible).
  - Repeat with the 125 ml mason jar.
- Alternative collection: if jars cannot be submerged, use pole or bucket sampler to collect.
- Filtration:
  - Place fresh filter paper in the filter; rinse syringe 3 times in water, then rinse filter with 30 ml of water from the syringe.
  - Rinse the 60 ml jar with 30 ml filtered water; fill completely with filtered water while minimizing air.
  - Repeat filtering for the second 125 ml jar.
  - If field time is limited, filtering can be performed in the laboratory the following day.
- In-field measurements:
  - Insert Hanna meters and mercury thermometer into the water at the sampling point; record conductivity, temperature (digital and mercury), and pH.
- Special handling:
  - Use bucket sampler to place instruments where water is hard to reach.
  - Reserve one syringe and filter set exclusively for saltwater work.
  - Read and note the stage board depth at Dolgarrog and Cwm Llanerch.
  - Use the comments box to record weather in the last 24 hours and any other observations.

## Data capture and QA
- Ensure proper labeling and sample integrity to support data quality and traceability.
- Maintain separation of saltwater and freshwater workflows for filtering materials.

## Office data management and sample tracking
- Update records:
  - Add sampling date and times to the Conwy monitoring sites and dates Excel spreadsheet.
- Documentation and filing:
  - Photocopy the field sheet; file the original in Dave N's cabinet and keep photocopies in the designated folder.
- Sample tracking sheets:
  - Prepare two Lancaster sample information sheets (one for filtered, one for unfiltered waters) with relevant sites, collection date, and batch number.
  - Print two copies of each information sheet on yellow and white paper.
- Sample packaging and labeling:
  - Pack filtered and unfiltered samples (125 ml jars) with yellow information sheets in a plastic bag if leakage is possible.
  - Add packing material to keep bottles stable; if space allows, fill the box with the next batch.
  - Label the box with the trip number using the sample box label document.
  - Email the Lancaster sample sheets to CHEM@wpo.nerc.ac.uk.
- File organization location references:
  - Conwy monitoring sites and dates: G:\PROJECTS\Conwy Carbon catchment (C03637 T9)\Procedures\Sites\
    Conwy monitoring sites and dates.xls
  - Field sheets originals: Dave N's filing cabinet (Conwy C Catchment field sheet originals)
  - Field sheet photocopies: C Catchment field sheet photocopies folder on Annette's desk shelf
  - Sample tracking sheets: G:\PROJECTS\Conwy Carbon catchment (C03637 T9)\Sample tracking\Lancs sample info sheets

## Notes
- If time is constrained in the field, filtration can be performed later in the laboratory.
- All equipment and samples must be clearly labeled to maintain data integrity and traceability across sampling events.
