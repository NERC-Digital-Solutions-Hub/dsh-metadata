# Routine Conwy carbon catchment water sampling protocol

- Purpose and scope
  - Routine water chemistry sampling in the Conwy carbon catchment.
  - Collect in-field measurements (conductivity, temperature, pH) and prepare samples for laboratory analysis.
  - Detailed handling to ensure samples are properly labeled, tracked, and transported.

- Equipment required
  - Field sheet (checklist)
  - For each sample point: 1 x 500 ml jar; 2 x 125 ml jars; 1 x 60 ml mason jar (all labeled with project name, site, trip number, date)
  - Sampling aids: pole sampler (for high flows), bucket sampler on a rope
  - Filtration: 0.45 µm, 47 mm cellulose nitrate filter papers; 2 filters and 2 syringes (one set for salt water, one for freshwater)
  - Instrumentation: mercury thermometer; Hanna combo pH and EC meters (HI98130 and HI98129)
  - Documentation: fields sheets, Lancaster sample information sheets (for filtered and unfiltered waters), “sample box label” template
  - Miscellaneous: packing materials to prevent movement, plastic bags for leak risk, access to a computer/Excel for data entry

- Sampling procedure (field)
  - Rinse 500 ml mason jar three times in the water; fill completely underwater and cap underwater to exclude air.
  - Repeat with the 125 ml mason jar; if water cannot be reached underwater, use the pole or bucket sampler.
  - Filter process: place fresh filter paper; rinse syringe three times in water and filter through with 30 ml of water from syringe.
  - Rinse the 60 ml jar with 30 ml filtered water; fill the 60 ml jar with filtered water, minimizing air.
  - Repeat filtering for the second 125 ml jar.
  - Note: if time is limited, filtering can be performed in the laboratory the following day.
  - In-situ measurements: insert Hanna meters and mercury thermometer; record conductivity, temperature, and pH.
  - If access is difficult, use the bucket sampler to position instruments in water.
  - Allocate one syringe and filter set exclusively for salt water work.
  - Record depth at Dolgarrog and Cwm Llanerch (stage board).
  - Use the comments box for weather conditions in the last 24 hours and any other observations.

- Sample handling and labeling
  - Ensure all bottles and information sheets are clearly labeled with project name, site name, trip number, and date.
  - Prepare for two sample streams (filtered and unfiltered) with corresponding Lancaster information sheets.

- Office activities and data management
  - Update the Conwy monitoring sites and dates Excel spreadsheet with sampling date and times.
  - Photocopy the field sheet; file the original in Dave N’s cabinet and store photocopies in the designated folder.
  - Create two Lancaster sample information sheets (filtered and unfiltered) with site details, collection date, and batch number; print two copies each (yellow and white).
  - Pack samples into a box: include all 125 ml jars (filtered and unfiltered) and yellow information sheets; protect contents to minimize movement.
  - If space allows, add the next batch to the same box.
  - Label the box with the trip number using the sample box label document.
  - Email the Lancaster sample sheets to CHEM@wpo.nerc.ac.uk

- Documentation and workflow notes
  - Use dedicated folders and labels for organization and traceability.
  - Maintain clear records of field observations and sample handling steps to support data integrity and future analysis.
