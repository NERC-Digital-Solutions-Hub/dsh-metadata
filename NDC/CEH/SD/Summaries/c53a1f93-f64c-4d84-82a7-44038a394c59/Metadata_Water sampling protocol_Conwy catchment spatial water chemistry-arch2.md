# Routine Conwy carbon catchment water sampling protocol

- Purpose: Standardized routine water chemistry sampling to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time, ensuring consistent data quality and compatibility with monitoring records.

## Equipment needed
- Fieldsheet (checklist on reverse)
- For each sample point:
  - 1 x 500 ml jar
  - 2 x 125 ml jars
  - 1 x 60 ml mason jar
  - All clearly labelled with project name, site name, trip number and date
- Field sampling aids:
  - Pole sampler (may be needed if flows are high)
  - Bucket sampler on a rope
- Filtration and lab prep:
  - 0.45 µm 47 mm cellulose nitrate filter papers
  - 2 x filters and 2 x syringes (one set for salt water, one set for freshwater)
- Instrumentation:
  - Mercury thermometer
  - Hanna HI98130 (pH and EC) and HI98129 meters
- Documentation and packaging:
  - Lancaster sample information sheets (for filtered and unfiltered waters)
  - Sample box labels and packing materials
  - Instructions and logs for office filing

## Sampling method (where possible)
- Rinse the 500 ml mason jar by removing cap and rinsing 3 times in the water; fill completely, cap underwater to exclude air.
- Repeat the procedure with the 125 ml mason jar.
- At sites where mason jars cannot be submerged, rinse and fill using the pole or bucket sampler.
- Prepare filtration:
  - Place a fresh filter paper in the filter.
  - Rinse the syringe 3 times in water, then rinse the filter with 30 ml of water from the syringe.
- Rinse the 60 ml jar with 30 ml filtered water, then fill completely, minimizing air.
- Repeat the filtration procedure for the second 125 ml jar.
  - If field time is limited, filtering can be performed in the laboratory the following day.
- Place the Hanna meters and mercury thermometer into the water at the sampling point and record:
  - Conductivity
  - Temperature (digital and mercury)
  - pH
- Use bucket sampler to place instruments if the site is difficult to reach the water from shore.
- Keep one syringe and filter set exclusively for salt water work.
- Read and note the stage board depth at Dolgarrog and Cwm Llanerch.
- Use the comments box to record weather in the previous 24 hours and any other observations.

## In-field measurements and observations
- Conductivity, temperature (digital and mercury), and pH readings at the sampling point.
- Record any notable site conditions or anomalies in the comments.

## Office activities and data management
- Update the Conwy monitoring sites and dates Excel spreadsheet with date/time of sampling.
- Photocopy the field sheet and file:
  - Original filed in Dave N’s cabinet (Conwy C Catchment field sheets originals)
  - Photocopy filed in the folder on Annette’s desk (‘C Catchment field sheet photocopies’)
- Complete two Lancaster sample information sheets (one for filtered, one for unfiltered waters) with relevant sites, collection date, and batch number.
- Print two copies of each information sheet (one yellow, one white).
- Pack filtered and unfiltered samples (125 ml jars) into a box with yellow information sheets (place in a plastic bag if leaks possible).
- Label the box with the trip number using the sample box label document.
- Email the Lancaster sample sheets to CHEM@wpo.nerc.ac.uk.

## Packaging, labeling and transport
- Pack bottles securely to prevent movement in transit.
- If there is space, fill the box with additional batches to maximize efficiency.
- Ensure the box is clearly labeled with trip number and contents.
