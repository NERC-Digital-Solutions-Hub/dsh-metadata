# Routine Conwy carbon catchment water sampling protocol

- Purpose: Standard operating procedure for routine water chemistry sampling in the Conwy carbon catchment, including field sampling and associated office/data-management tasks. Measures include conductivity, temperature (digital and mercury), and pH; filtration and sample handling are specified.

## Equipment needed
- Fieldsheet (checklist on reverse)
- For each sample point:
  - 1 x 500 ml
  - 2 x 125 ml
  - 1 x 60 ml mason jar
  - All clearly labelled with project name, site name, trip number and date
- Field tools:
  - Pole sampler (may be needed if flows are high)
  - Bucket sampler on a rope
- Filtration and sampling supplies:
  - 0.45 µm, 47 mm cellulose nitrate filter papers
  - 2 x filters and 2 x syringes (one set for saltwater, one for freshwater)
  - Mercury thermometer
  - Hanna combination pH and EC meters (HI98130 and HI98129)
  
## Sampling method (where possible)
- Rinse and fill containers:
  - Rinse 500 ml mason jar 3 times in water; fill completely, cap underwater.
  - Repeat for 125 ml mason jars.
  - If jars cannot be submerged, use pole or bucket sampler.
- Filtration steps:
  - Place fresh filter paper; rinse syringe 3 times in water, then pass 30 ml water through filter.
  - Rinse the 60 ml jar with 30 ml filtered water, then fill completely (minimize air).
  - Repeat filtering for the second 125 ml jar.
  - Note: filtering can be done in the laboratory the following day if time-limited.
- In-situ measurements:
  - Insert Hanna meters and mercury thermometer into the water; record conductivity, temperature, and pH.
  - If difficult to access water, use bucket sampler to place instruments.
- Special notes:
  - Keep one syringe and filter set exclusively for saltwater work.
  - Read and note the stage board depth at Dolgarrog and Cwm Llanerch.
  - Use the comments box for weather-related observations and any other notes.

## Data capture and field records
- Record on-site measurements:
  - Conductivity, temperature (digital and mercury), pH
  - Depth readings at specified sites
  - Weather conditions and recent observations in the comments
- Sample labeling and tracking:
  - Ensure all samples are clearly labeled with project, site, trip, date, and batch information
  - Use two Lancaster sample information sheets (one for filtered, one for unfiltered waters) with relevant site, date, and batch numbers
- Data transport:
  - Update the Conwy monitoring sites and dates spreadsheet with sampling dates and times
  - Photocopy the field sheet and file both original and copy in designated locations

## Office activities and data/administration workflow
- Documentation and filing:
  - Enter sampling date/time into the Conwy monitoring sites and dates Excel file
  - Photocopy and file the field sheet; store original in the specified file cabinet and photocopy in the designated folder
- Sample tracking and information sheets:
  - Prepare two Lancaster sample information sheets (filtered and unfiltered) with site and batch details
  - Print two copies on yellow paper and two on white paper
- Sample packaging and labeling:
  - Pack filtered and unfiltered samples (all 125 ml jars) with yellow information sheets
  - Use packing material to prevent movement; if space allows, top up with the next batch
  - Label the outer box with trip number using the sample box label template
- Communications:
  - Email the Lancaster sample sheets to CHEM@wpo.nerc.ac.uk

## Relevance to GIS Specialists
- Data elements for mapping and analysis:
  - Site names, sampling dates, trip numbers, depths, and weather observations
  - On-site measurements: conductivity, pH, temperature
  - Batch numbers and sample tracking information for linking chemistry data to locations
- Data quality and workflow:
  - Standardized sampling procedures and labeling support consistent, audit-friendly data for spatial analysis
  - Clear documentation and archiving facilitate integration of chemistry data with GIS datasets and monitoring site maps
- Data management:
  - Structured office processes (spreadsheets, field sheets, and information sheets) enable reliable data merging and geospatial visualization of water chemistry across sites and times
- Practical considerations for GIS users:
  - Ensure metadata (site, date, depth, weather) is captured to enable temporal and spatial analyses
  - Maintain linkages between field samples and GIS-ready records through standardized labeling, batch numbers, and documentation.
