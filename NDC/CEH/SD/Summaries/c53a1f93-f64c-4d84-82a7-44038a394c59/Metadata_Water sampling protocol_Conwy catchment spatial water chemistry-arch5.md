# Routine Conwy carbon catchment water sampling protocol

## Overview
- Routine protocol for collecting water chemistry samples in the Conwy carbon catchment (Version 1, 19/9/2008).
- Documented by Annette Burden; locations and file paths provided for storage and reference.

## Data Produced and Metadata
- Samples collected and labeled with: project name, site name, trip number, date.
- Sample types and containers: 500 ml, 125 ml (two), 60 ml mason jars per site.
- Measured parameters (in-field): conductivity, temperature (digital and mercury thermometer), pH.
- Additional observations: stage board depth at Dolgarrog and Cwm Llanerch; weather comments (current and previous 24 hours).
- Metadata artifacts: field sheets, Lancaster sample information sheets (two: filtered and unfiltered waters), sample tracking spreadsheet (Conwy monitoring sites and dates.xls), and sample box labels.

## Data Collection Procedures (Sampling Method)
- Jar preparation: rinse jars (3x) and fill completely underwater when possible to avoid air bubbles.
- Filtration: place fresh filter paper, rinse syringe and filter, and filter samples (use separate syringe/filter sets for saltwater vs freshwater).
- Water handling: rinse jars with filtered water, fill to capacity, minimize air; if water access is difficult, use pole or bucket sampler.
- Instrument deployment: place Hanna meters and thermometer in water to record conductivity, temperature, and pH.
- Documentation: record stage depth at specified sites; use comments box for weather and other observations.
- Time management: if time is limited, filtration can be performed in the laboratory the following day.

## Data Management, Storage, and Archiving
- Office tasks to support data governance:
  - Record sampling date/time in the Conwy monitoring sites and dates Excel spreadsheet.
  - Photocopy and file the field sheet (original filed in a designated cabinet; photocopy stored in a separate folder).
  - Prepare two Lancaster sample information sheets (one for filtered, one for unfiltered), with site, collection date, and batch number; print duplicates (yellow and white).
  - Pack and label samples in a box with packing materials; label with trip number using standardized sample box label.
  - Email Lancaster sample sheets to CHEM@wpo.nerc.ac.uk.
- Storage locations and references:
  - Field sheets and related documents stored on G: drives and specific subfolders.
  - Sample tracking and site-date records maintained in the specified Excel workbook.
  - Sample box labeling and information sheets use predefined templates and folder paths.

## Quality Assurance and Control
- Field sanitation and sample integrity steps: thorough rinsing of containers, underwater filling, and proper filtration protocol to minimize contamination.
- Use of separate equipment for saltwater vs freshwater to prevent cross-contamination.
- Recording both digital and physical (mercury) temperature measurements enhances data comparability.
- Time lag option acknowledged: field filtration can occur the following day in a laboratory if necessary.

## Access, Sharing, and Communication
- Primary data sharing pathway: email Lancaster sample sheets to the designated CHEM address for processing.
- Data discoverability relies on structured filing in identified network drives and standardized forms (field sheets, Lancaster sheets, and the Excel log).

## Risks, Limitations, and Considerations
- Data completeness may be impacted by field time constraints or difficult sampling sites.
- Multiple data formats and storage systems (field sheets, info sheets, Excel logs, physical sample boxes) require careful synchronization to maintain data integrity.
- Potential for outdated or mismatched metadata if consistent updating processes are not followed.

## Recommendations for Data Stewards
- Ensure consistent metadata capture across all field sheets and information sheets (site, date, trip, batch, depth, weather).
- Standardize naming conventions and storage paths to improve findability and interoperability across projects.
- Maintain version-controlled data artifacts and routine backups of both digital and physical records.
- Implement centralized validation checks to align field data with the corresponding information sheets and Excel logs.
- Promote a unified data portal or repository approach to replace or augment scattered network drives and paper copies, reducing fragmentation and improving discoverability.
