# Routine Conwy carbon catchment water sampling protocol

## Overview
- A version 1 protocol for routine water chemistry sampling in the Conwy carbon catchment.
- Provides standardized equipment, sampling methods, and office workflows to ensure data quality, traceability, and support for monitoring and decision-making.

## Equipment
- Fieldsheet (checklist on reverse)
- For each sample point:
  - 1 x 500 ml jar
  - 2 x 125 ml jars
  - 1 x 60 ml mason jar
  - All clearly labelled with project name, site name, trip number, and date
- Sampling aids:
  - Pole sampler (for high-flow sites)
  - Bucket sampler on a rope
- Filtration and liquids:
  - 0.45 µm, 47 mm cellulose nitrate filter papers
  - 2 x filters and 2 x syringes (one set for salt water, one for fresh water)
  - Mercury thermometer
  - Hanna combo pH and EC meters (HI98130 and HI98129)
- Additional: packing materials and reference documents for field and office use

## Sampling method
- Jars:
  - Rinse 500 ml jar three times in the water; fill completely underwater to minimize air bubbles.
  - Repeat with the 125 ml jar.
  - If underwater filling isn’t possible, use pole/bucket sampler; rinse the 60 ml jar with 30 ml filtered water before filling.
- Filtration:
  - Insert fresh filter paper; rinse syringe three times in water and filter through with 30 ml water from the syringe.
  - Rinse the 60 ml jar with 30 ml filtered water; fill completely with filtered water, minimizing air.
  - Repeat filtration for the second 125 ml jar.
  - If time-constrained, filtration can be performed in the lab the following day.
  - Maintain one syringe and filter set exclusively for salt water work.
- In-field measurements:
  - Insert Hanna meters and mercury thermometer into water; record conductivity, temperature (digital and mercury), and pH.
  - Record stage board depth at Dolgarrog and Cwm Llanerch.
  - Use the comments box for weather and other observations.
- Special considerations:
  - Use bucket sampler for hard-to-reach sites.
  - Ensure proper labeling and separation of saltwater vs freshwater sampling components.

## Field data capture and sample handling
- Weather and sampling conditions documented in the comments box.
- Collect and note depth measurements where required.
- Maintain strict labeling and tracking of samples to ensure traceability.

## Office/administrative workflow
- Update databases:
  - Add sampling date/time to the Conwy monitoring sites and dates spreadsheet.
- Documentation and filing:
  - Photocopy the field sheet; file original in designated location and store photocopy in the specified folder.
- Sample tracking and information sheets:
  - Fill two Lancaster sample information sheets (one for filtered, one for unfiltered waters) with site, date, and batch number.
  - Print two copies of each info sheet (one yellow, one white).
- Sample packaging and labeling:
  - Pack filtered and unfiltered samples (125 ml jars) with yellow info sheets in a box; add packing material to prevent movement.
  - Label the box with the trip number using provided labels.
  - Email Lancaster sample sheets to CHEM@wpo.nerc.ac.uk.
- Data and sample management:
  - Maintain organized sample boxes and ensure information sheets accompany samples to preserve chain-of-custody and data integrity.
