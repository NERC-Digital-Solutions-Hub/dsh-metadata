# Tyn y Fron: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

- Purpose and scope
  - Field notes documenting ongoing monitoring of tensiometers and overland flow (OLF) traps, including sensor status, maintenance actions, data integrity, and operational challenges from 2005 to 2009.

- System components and data flow
  - Instruments and setups
    - Tensiometers at multiple plots (e.g., Plot 3.1, 3.2, 3.3) at depths of 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm.
    - OLF traps with tipping buckets, float switches, and associated data loggers (Delta-T) and Tinytag sensors.
    - Pumps, gutters, and associated wiring/cabling; occasional damage from wildlife or weather.
  - Data collection and logging
    - Regular data downloads from Delta-T loggers and Tinytags.
    - Occasional gaps or corruption in data (e.g., storm-related electrical surges causing nonsensible readings; battery failures; logging stops).
    - Calibration and reinstallation activities noted to ensure data continuity and accuracy.
  - Metadata and context
    - Frequent notes on maintenance timing, weather events, animal interference, and physical condition of equipment (e.g., batteries, tubing, reed switches, grounding).

- Data quality and integrity issues
  - Equipment and environmental disruptions
    - Storms causing electrical surges leading to nonsensical sensor readings across multiple devices (May 2005).
    - Water ingress in pits and gutters from rainfall; pump batteries depleting; gutters blocked by debris (worms, sediment).
    - Wildlife interference (sheep, voles, birds, foxes) causing physical damage to cables, tubes, and housings.
  - Sensor-specific problems and data gaps
    - Tensiometer degassing and occasional misreadings; some 10 cm/30 cm/50 cm sensors missing or displaced.
    - Delta-T logging intermittently losing data or reverting to default programs; battery/connectivity issues.
    - Tinytag data gaps or damage (e.g., battery failures, data offloading issues, connection problems leading to missed tips).
    - Reed switches and tipping bucket mechanisms requiring recalibration or replacement after faults.
  - Data cleaning practices and caveats
    - Periods of “ignore tips” during suspected disturbances or maintenance windows.
    - Cross-referencing across multiple sensors to verify events (e.g., rainfall-driven tip counts vs. Delta-T records).
    - Frequent need to re-calibrate sensors and replace damaged components to restore data quality.

- Maintenance actions and governance
  - Routine and corrective maintenance
    - Degassing of tensiometers; reinstallation or repositioning after movement or damage.
    - Battery replacements for Delta-T and Tinytag units; checking and re-seating connections.
    - Repaired or replaced tubing, reed switches, sump covers, and OLF gutter components.
    - Recalibration of tipping buckets and tensiometers following faults or after significant rainfall events.
  - Infrastructure improvements
    - Enlarged trenches and deeper pits to handle drainage; added protective measures against wildlife damage (lawn edging, plastic covers).
    - Replaced and recalibrated tensiometers across plots; updated sensor placements where necessary.
  - Data handling practices
    - Documentation of maintenance actions tied to data quality issues (e.g., data to be ignored during certain times, known disturbances).
    - Attempts to recover data after outages by re-downloading, replacing faulty Tinytags, and aligning program configurations with field conditions.
    - Explicit notes on data recovery efforts and limitations (e.g., data not recoverable from certain periods, or program defaults interfering with logging).

- Data leadership insights and recommendations for data systems
  - Robust fault tolerance and redundancy
    - Field data systems require resilient power supplies, reliable communication between loggers, and redundant pathways to minimize data loss during storms or battery failures.
  - Comprehensive metadata and governance
    - Maintain detailed maintenance logs, disturbance windows, and anomaly notes to contextualize data, enabling accurate interpretation and secondary analyses.
  - Standardization and interoperability
    - Consistent labeling of plots, depths, and sensor types; standardized calibration procedures; uniform handling of “ignore tips” periods across datasets.
  - Data quality as a core deliverable
    - Regular cross-validation across multiple sensors (tensiometers, Delta-T, Tinytags) to confirm events and detect sensor drift or failures.
  - Proactive maintenance planning
    - Schedule routine checks aligned with seasonal weather patterns; preempt wildlife protection measures; ensure spare parts and replacement units are readily available.
  - Lessons for scale and networks
    - Field networks spanning multiple plots and devices benefit from centralized data governance, standardized SOPs, and collaborative practices to reduce duplication of effort and improve data discoverability and usability.
