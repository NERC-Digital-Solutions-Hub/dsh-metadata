# Penllywn: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

## Overview
- Long-running field monitoring log (2005–2009) of tensiometers and overland flow (OLF) traps across multiple plots.
- Primary data types: tensiometer readings, OLF tipping bucket tips, Delta-T logger data, and TinyTag data; supplemented by routine measurements (pits, gutters, leaf collectors).
- Purpose: document installation, maintenance, data quality issues, and corrective actions to support reliable data collection and interpretation.

## Data collection components and data flow
- Instruments involved:
  - Tensiometers (multiple depths; e.g., 10 cm, 50 cm)
  - OLF tipping buckets and associated gutters
  - Delta-T temperature/logging system
  - TinyTag data loggers
  - Permeameters and leaf collectors in some plots
- Data collection activities:
  - Installation, degassing, recalibration, battery changes, desiccant monitoring
  - Regular data downloads and clock checks; some periods of data loss or corruption
  - Calibration events for tipping buckets; alignment of channels and reed switches
- Data quality notes:
  - Frequent observations of data gaps, clock drift, and mislogged tips
  - Some data flagged as test runs or to be discarded (“ignore tips” windows)
  - Occasional requirement to rewire or replace loggers and sensors to restore data flow

## Key data quality issues and causes
- Power and hardware failures:
  - Battery depletion (big batteries, Delta-T batteries) causing logger downtime
  - Desiccant or desiccant-related logging issues; clock resets
  - External power vs. internal power mode affecting Delta-T and loggers
- Sensor and mechanical problems:
  - Pumps and wiring failures; clogged or blocked pumps; gunk in gutters
  - Reed switches, connections, and channel misconfigurations leading to incorrect tipping data
  - Tipping buckets sticking or double-logging tips; miscalibrations requiring recalibration
- Environmental and biological interference:
  - Storm events causing electrical surges or transient data anomalies
  - Water ingress into pits; vole damage; sediment blocking gutters and OLF components
  - Grass, leaves, and debris affecting trench integrity and sensor exposure
- Data integrity and logging issues:
  - Clocks drifting, data downlinks not matching actual events, and data needing reformatting
  - Data flagged as unreliable or brand-new installation periods requiring verification
  - Occasional need to disregard tip data during calibration or maintenance windows

## Data management and quality assurance practices
- Maintenance and calibration routines:
  - Regular degassing and recalibration of tensiometers; replacement of batteries and desiccants
  - Rewiring, recalibration, and fine-tuning of delta-T and tipping bucket connections
  - Physical maintenance: cleaning gutters, replacing sump covers, repairing elbows and tubing
- Data handling and validation:
  - Downloading data biweekly or more frequently during maintenance windows
  - Cross-checking Delta-T, tensiometer and tipping bucket outputs; ensuring channel mappings are correct
  - Marking and excluding data during known faulty periods (e.g., test runs, timing discrepancies)
- Documentation and governance:
  - Detailed, time-stamped field notes documenting issues and actions
  - Plot-specific labeling and consistent notation of equipment (e.g., plot numbers, sensor IDs)
  - Recommendations to ignore or flag certain data segments for quality control

## Notable patterns, challenges, and recommendations
- Recurrent reliability challenges:
  - Recurrent battery/power issues and pump/wiring faults driving data gaps
  - Channel misconfigurations and reed-switch problems necessitating re-wiring and re-calibration
- Data quality improvement strategies:
  - Implement robust power solutions (e.g., reliable external power where feasible)
  - Routine, scheduled maintenance with proactive component replacements (batteries, desiccants, gaskets)
  - Automated health checks and flagging of outages to minimize data loss
- Operational guidance for data support:
  - Establish clear data quality flags for outages, calibration periods, and maintenance windows
  - Maintain biweekly or more frequent data downloads to minimize data loss and ensure timely quality checks
  - Maintain a standardized protocol for ignoring or including data during known anomalies or test phases

## End-of-record highlights and actionable takeaways
- 2007–2009 period involved frequent logger and sensor issues (Delta-T, reed switches, tenths of tensio meters) requiring multiple repairs and recalibrations.
- Common corrective actions included replacing batteries, rewiring connections, degassing tensiometers, recalibrating tipping buckets, and upgrading or re-routing components.
- Documentation consistently emphasized careful data hygiene: ignore tips during scripted test times, verify clock synchronization, and verify data integrity before analysis.
- Final notes indicate transitions to updated configurations (e.g., installation of alternative tensiometer depths and new gutter/tipping bucket configurations) to improve data reliability.
