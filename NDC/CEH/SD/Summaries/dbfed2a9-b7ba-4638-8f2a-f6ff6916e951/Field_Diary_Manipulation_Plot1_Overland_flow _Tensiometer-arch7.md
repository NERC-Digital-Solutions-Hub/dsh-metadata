# Rhos1: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

## Overview
- Field notes documenting maintenance, testing, and data issues for tensiometers and Overland Flow (OLF) traps at Rhos1.
- Includes observations on sensor behavior, environmental conditions, equipment repairs, calibration, and data handling practices.

## Instrumentation and data types
- Tensiometers deployed at plots with multiple depths (e.g., 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm).
- OLF traps with related gutters, holes, and pumps; includes reed switches and tipping buckets.
- Data loggers and sensors referenced include Delta-T loggers, tinytags, and battery/desiccant maintenance.
- Data elements recorded: sensor readings, tipping events, data downloads, calibration results, and battery/desiccant status.

## Field conditions and data quality issues
- Storm events and electrical surges linked to nonsensical or strongly altered sensor readings.
- Moisture and desiccant issues affecting data accuracy; occasional data degradation attributed to moisture in loggers.
- Frequent field problems: traps/ponding in pits, gutters blocked by debris (e.g., dead worms), water-filled pits, reed switch faults, pump failures, and valve/float switch sticking.
- Occasional data segments marked as unreliable or to be ignored due to field interventions or equipment faults.
- Regular environmental disturbances: grass growth, trench work, and sediment sampling impacting sensor access and data collection.

## Maintenance, troubleshooting, and calibration activities
- Regular degassing, vent checks, grass cutting, and cleaning of gutters/vents.
- Battery replacements and desiccant changes; some loggers noted as needing new desiccant or power issues.
- Reed switch repairs/replacements and recalibration of tipping buckets; some plots required tubing/elbow adjustments or new pumps.
- External interventions to restore flow/pump function and recalibrate tipping buckets; calibration details documented (including specific tip counts).
- Destructive sampling and trenching noted alongside equipment work; some tips data marked as ignore during certain time windows.
- Data handling includes downloading data and verifying sensor performance; calibration sheets referenced for accuracy checks.

## Data management practices observed
- Use of comment boxes and timestamps to indicate data validity; explicit notes to ignore certain tips or data windows.
- Frequent cross-checks between field actions and data logs to distinguish genuine signals from artefacts caused by maintenance.
- Documentation of equipment status changes (batteries, desiccant, reed switches) and their impact on data continuity.
- Final entries consolidate tensiometer locations and serial numbers, linking field notes to instrument identity.

## GIS implications and recommendations
- Data should be quality-checked for storms/electrical surges, moisture effects, and equipment faults before GIS visualization.
- Maintain metadata on maintenance events, calibration activities, and data validity windows to explain temporal gaps or anomalies in maps/time-series.
- Integrate notes on sensor depth, plot IDs, and equipment IDs to support accurate spatial-temporal analysis.
- Flag data segments to caution against misinterpretation during periods of known issues (e.g., post-storm anomalies, ignored tips).

## Appendices / end notes
- Ends with a record of tensiometer locations and depths, including serial numbers (e.g., M1.1 at 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm; M1.2; M1.3) with associated values or statuses noted during 2008–2009 observations.
