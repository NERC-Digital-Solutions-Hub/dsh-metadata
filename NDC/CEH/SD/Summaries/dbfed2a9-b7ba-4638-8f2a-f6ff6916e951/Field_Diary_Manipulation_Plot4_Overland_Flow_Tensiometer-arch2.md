# Penllywn: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

## Summary at a glance
- Document detail of field monitoring of tensiometers and overland flow (OLF) traps across multiple plots from 2005 to 2009, including installation, maintenance, calibration, and data logging activities.
- Recurrent data quality issues: storms causing sensor spikes, battery failures, logging clock/device desynchronisations, and occasional data gaps or misrecorded tips.
- Frequent maintenance actions: degassing tensiometers, recalibration, battery and desiccant changes, pump and wiring fixes, gutter and trap cleaning, trenching, and grass cutting.
- Notable challenges: water in pits, vole damage to materials, tangled wiring, reed switches and channel problems, and occasional double tipping or miscalibrated tipping buckets.
- Data handling practices: indications to ignore certain tips or time windows during noisy periods; biweekly to periodic downloads; ongoing data cleaning and reconfiguration of equipment to improve reliability.
- End state (2009): upgrade and reconfiguration of tensiometer deployments (M4 plots) with multiple depth placements (10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) and ongoing attention to equipment integrity and data integrity.

## Monitoring setup and data flow
- Equipment and measurements:
  - Tensiometers at multiple depths and OLF tipping buckets (tipping bucket setups) across plots (e.g., Plot 1–4 variants).
  - OLF traps with associated gutters, pumps, and tinytags to log sub-surface water events.
  - Delta-T loggers and Tinytags used for data logging; occasional clock and wiring issues.
- Data handling:
  - Regular data downloads from loggers; data quality checks and calibration as part of routine maintenance.
  - Instructions within notes to ignore tips during certain periods (e.g., calibration, data glitches, or during/after maintenance).
  - Data storage and portal upload implied as a routine practice for dataset management.

## Data quality: issues and remedies
- Environmental and equipment-related disruptions:
  - Storm events causing electrical surges and nonsensical readings (19/07/05).
  - Battery depletion, dead desiccants, and loggers stopping or mislogging data (e.g., 28/01/06, 22/03/08, 09/01/09).
  - Clock drift, misaligned Delta-T timings, and reassignments of channels due to wiring or reed switch faults (various 2006–2007 entries).
- Sensor and hardware faults:
  - T/B (tipping bucket) slider or magnet issues, reed switches failing, and loose/tangled wiring requiring reconfiguration (2006–2007).
  - Pumps failing or becoming blocked, gutters clogged with debris, and pit waterlogging requiring drainage.
  - Debris and vole damage affecting OLF gutters and wiring, necessitating repairs and protective measures.
- Calibration and validation:
  - Regular degassing of tensiometers and calibration of tipping buckets (2006–2009).
  - Delta-T and tensiometer recalibrations following identified faults or after hardware replacements (2006–2009).

## Maintenance actions and procedures
- Degassing and calibration:
  - Routine degassing of tensiometers; rechecking 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm probes.
  - Tipping bucket calibration and adjustments to avoid double tipping.
- Power and sensors:
  - Battery changes for Delta-T loggers and pumps; desiccant replacement; addressing battery low warnings.
  - Replacement of reed switches, wiring rewiring, and logger replacements as needed.
- Mechanical and physical upkeep:
  - Pump replacements and wiring repairs; gutter cleaning and covers replacement to prevent vole damage.
  - Grass cutting around cages, trench digging above plots, enlarging pits where necessary.
  - Replacing and resealing OLF gutters, sump covers, and plastic connectors; adjusting/tidying plumbing for flow.
- Data integrity measures:
  - Scheduling downloads biweekly or as needed; marking periods to disregard data during testing or calibration windows.
  - Reassigning data channels and re-downloading after hardware changes to ensure continuity.

## Common problems and troubleshooting themes
- Electrical and data logging:
  - Dodgy connections and faulty wiring causing data gaps or clock misalignment.
  - Delta-T logger channel and trip switch issues; occasional need to rewire channels to fix incorrect tip counts.
  - External power vs. internal power supply instability affecting logging reliability.
- Water management and pit integrity:
  - Pits filling with water; pumps failing or becoming blocked; need for descaling, pipe adjustments, and replacement.
  - Drainage and gutter issues leading to standing water and potential data loss during calibration windows.
- Physical and environmental interference:
  - Vole damage to wiring and gutter components; protective covers and re-anchoring required.
  - Debris, algae in OLF connectors, and occasional mud or silt affecting flow and readings.
- Data interpretation cautions:
  - Frequent notes to ignore certain tips or data during specific periods due to calibration, testing, or known issues.
  - Occasional data anomalies deemed “strange data” requiring further scrutiny (e.g., 30/06/08).

## Data management implications for analysts
- The logs illustrate a rigorous but manual maintenance regime essential to ensuring long-term data quality and continuity.
- Analysts should:
  - Be aware of and account for documented periods of data exclusion or suspect measurements.
  - Track sensor deployments and hardware changes to interpret data continuity and potential biases.
  - Apply standardized quality checks, including degassing, calibration, and battery/desiccant status, when interpreting time series data.
  - Recognize the value of regular data downloads and proper data storage to enable cross-year environmental health assessments.

## Timeline highlights
- 2005:
  - Initial installation of tensiometers; early data quality issues after storm events.
  - Early troubleshooting of logger readings and trap functionality; several notes to disregard data during certain periods.
- 2006:
  - Ongoing maintenance: battery changes, desiccant checks, degassing, calibration, and pump repairs.
  - Recurrent problems with data logging synchronization and sensor wiring; multiple notes on recalibration and channel fixes.
- 2007:
  - Increased attention to Delta-T logging reliability; multiple incidents of battery failures and data gaps.
  - Reconfiguration of channels and enhanced calibration efforts; some “ignore tips” periods during calibration.
- 2008–2009:
  - Continued field maintenance, with more extensive reconfiguration of plots (notably M4 series) and multiple depth deployments (10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm).
  - Ongoing replacement of gutters, covers, and tensio components; emphasis on ensuring stable long-term data collection and integrity.

## Endnotes and ongoing considerations
- The documentation underscores the need for robust data management, including:
  - Clear guidelines on when to ignore data during maintenance or calibration.
  - Regular hardware checks and timely replacement of failing components to maintain data integrity.
  - Documentation of equipment changes to support downstream analysis and comparability across years.
