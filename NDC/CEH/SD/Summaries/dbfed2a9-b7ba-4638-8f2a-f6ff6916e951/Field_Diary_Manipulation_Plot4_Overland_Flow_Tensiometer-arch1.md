# Penllywn: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

## Overview
- Field monitoring notes for tensiometers and OLF (overland flow) traps, spanning 2005–2009.
- Instruments involved: tensiometers at various depths (10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm), OLF tipping-buckets, Delta-T loggers, tinytags.
- Purpose: capture soil water status and overland flow dynamics; document installations, maintenance, data issues, and calibration.

## Timeline Highlights
- 2005
  - Installation of tensiometers; initial data downloads; early readings inconsistent due to a storm-related electrical surge.
  - De-gassing, wiring changes, and early maintenance activities recorded.
- 2006
  - Ongoing troubleshooting of loggers, pumps, and hoses; batteries and desiccants replaced; desiccant and degassing routines emphasized.
  - Multiple occurrences of pumps failing or becoming blocked; tipping-bucket calibration and detector wiring issues noted.
- 2007
  - Frequent data logging problems: clock drift, mislogged tips, channel mismatches, and battery-related outages.
  - Rewiring and recalibration efforts; several tips logged incorrectly due to reed-switch/connector issues; some data flagged as test runs or required discarding.
  - Increased emphasis on verifying data integrity during downloads and after hardware changes.
- 2008
  - Delta-T logger issues and power supply changes; some data gaps due to battery and external power transitions.
  - More systematic calibration of tipping buckets; replacements of reed switches and wiring; addressing vole/animal disturbances and gutter blockages.
  - Improvements in maintenance cadence: degassing, calibrations, and periodic system checks; some data anomalies still noted and flagged.
- 2009
  - Continued maintenance and calibration; notes reference ongoing checks for plot integrity (M4.1–M4.3) and detector performance.
  - Specific updates to equipment configurations at plots, including final notes on tensiometer depths and installation status.

## Sensor & Data Quality Issues
- Data anomalies following storm events; electrical surges corrupt logger readings.
- Tipping bucket data occasionally not logged due to reed-switch or channel wiring problems; need for re-calibration and re-wiring.
- Delta-T loggers suffered battery/connection issues, clock drift, and occasional loss of external power reliability.
- Pits filled with water due to pump failures or blockages; calibration data affected by poor drainage.
- Algae and debris in sensor ports; sediment and vole damage observed in pits/gutters; blockages in tubes and downpipes.
- Double tipping and mis-tipped events; occasional misalignment of channels requiring reassignments.
- Regular need to ignore data during known test periods and maintenance windows; documentation of these windows in logs.

## Maintenance, Repairs & Operational Practices
- Routine degassing of tensiometers and desiccant/battery checks; frequent recalibration of sensors.
- Pump replacements and wiring fixes; reed switch replacements; detector/tipping-bucket reattachments.
- Cleaning and maintenance of gutters, vents, and downpipes; addressing blockages and sediment buildup.
- Calibration activities for tipping buckets; troubleshooting and re-seating tensiometers; replacing batteries and cables as needed.
- Proactive data hygiene: marking data to ignore during maintenance, cross-checking against downtime logs, and updating logger configurations.
- Environmental safeguards: addressing vole damage, sheep interference, and ensuring proper enclosure of logger/wiring to reduce interference.

## Data Management, Metadata & QA Considerations
- Importance of detailed metadata: timestamps, calibration events, battery status, Desiccant changes, and maintenance notes.
- Downloads regularly logged; need to flag and document suspect periods (test runs, mislogging, or blocked data).
- Documentation mentions referential diagrams (book/diagrams) and the need to keep datasets discoverable with clear provenance.
- Emphasis on reproducibility: align channel configurations, keep track of any reassignments, and note data quality assessments and corrections.

## Environmental & Operational Challenges
- Weather-driven issues: storms causing data anomalies and physical damage; wet pits and rising water levels complicating data capture.
- Biological/animal disturbances: vole activity and occasional sheep interference impacting wiring and sensors.
- Accessibility and hardware durability: frequent blockages, mud, and debris affecting pumps and tubing; ongoing need for robust protection and maintenance planning.
- Data management burden: large, long-running datasets with diverse sensor types require careful QA and consistent documentation to remain usable for analysis.

## Implications for Data-Driven Analysis
- Expect and plan for data gaps and quality issues; design analyses to handle missing or flagged data.
- Implement strict QA pipelines: verify sensor integrity, channel mappings, and calibration status before analysis; use ignore- windows as documented.
- Track maintenance and sensor health as key covariates (battery level, desiccant status, pump health, clogging events) to explain data variability.
- Maintain rich metadata to enable reproducibility and audit trails for any correlations or predictive modeling.
- Consider redundancy and preventive maintenance (backup loggers, spare pumps, protected wiring) to improve data continuity.

## Current Status (as of 18 Aug 2009)
- Plots and sensors labeled M4.1, M4.2, M4.3 with a mix of 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm tensiometers.
- 50 cm tensio deployment noted in M4.3; ongoing attention needed to ensure data reliability across plots.
- Documented ongoing calibration checks, data integrity reviews, and maintenance interventions to sustain data collection and quality.
