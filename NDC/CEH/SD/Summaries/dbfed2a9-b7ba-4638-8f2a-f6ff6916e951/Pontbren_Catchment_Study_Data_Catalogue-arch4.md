# Pontbren Database Catalogue

- Documents instrumentation and data produced across Pontbren study sites, including borehole logging, N-probe data, streamflow measurements, and related field records. 
- Presents site-specific equipment, drilling methods, borehole logs, grid references, datum levels, lithology descriptions, completion details, sampling intervals, and appendices with flow gauging and calibration notes. 
- Aims to support data discoverability, provenance, and interpretation, with emphasis on metadata richness and site-level context to enable cross-site analyses.

## What this document covers

- Equipment and methods used for borehole investigation, including drilling rigs, augers, drill rods, and log sheets.
- Site-specific borehole records (NP20–NP23) including location, grid references, datum levels, depth measurements, lithology descriptions, and borehole completions.
- Field documentation practices and data-presentation conventions (e.g., borehole log structure, sampling intervals, and depth references).
- Streamflow gauging data (Appendix D), detailing flow metered estimates with timestamps, site identifiers, and measured values.

## Specific data content in this excerpt

- Equipment & Methods
  - Drilling and sampling setup: hand auger, AQ drill rod/guide tube, pneumatic hammer, Atlas Copco RAB tools.
  - Borehole logging practices: field sheets with site name, grid reference, datum level, thickness, depth, description, and completion details.
  - Example sites and logs:
    - NP20 NP21 NP22 at various sub-sites around Llanfair Caereinion and Rhos/Tree areas.
    - NP23 (COED CWM-Y-LLWYNOG, Llanfair Caereinion) with field notes on soil descriptions and lithology.
  - Descriptions typically include soil colors, textures (silty clay, clay, gravel content), mottling, depth to interfaces, and different completion materials (e.g., aluminium access tubes).
  - Logs document samples collected at various depths (e.g., 0.25–1.50 mBGL), datum levels, and materials encountered (humic soils, clay, gravels, sandstone/mudstone fragments).

- N-probe and groundwater context
  - N-probe entries linked to specific manipulation plots and edge-of-wood sites with depth intervals and soil descriptions.
  - Depths and lithologies captured in detail, providing a basis for groundwater and soil moisture interpretation.

- Appendix D: Streamflow gauging sites
  - Compiled flow metered spot measurements with start/finish times and measured flow values.
  - Site references include multiple locations (Sites 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, etc.), with numerous date-time pairs and flow estimates (ls-1).
  - Data include both short-duration measurements and longer intervals, illustrating calibration and cross-checking with other flow estimation methods.

## Data structure, metadata, and quality

- Each borehole log is tied to a precise grid reference, datum level, and recorded depths, with detailed lithology descriptions to support interpretation and calibration needs.
- Logs include explicit completion details (e.g., aluminium access tubing diameter), sample intervals, and depth ranges, enabling reproducibility and cross-site comparisons.
- Streamflow appendices provide time-stamped, site-specific flow measurements for calibration and validation of hydrological models.
- The documentation style emphasizes contextual notes (soil types, rooting, presence of peat or organic layers) to inform data quality assessment and interpretation.

## Data Leaders takeaways and actions

- Governance and provenance
  - Maintain and expand metadata linkage between borehole NP numbers, site locations, grid references, and datum levels to ensure traceability.
  - Preserve the detailed borehole log structure (thickness, depth, lithology, completion details) to support re-use and cross-site synthesis.

- Data quality and calibration
  - Use the logs and accompanying notes to inform calibration of groundwater and soil moisture sensors, ensuring site-specific conditions are reflected in analyses.
  - Integrate streamflow metered measurements with other hydrological data (Starflow, weirs) for robust cross-validation and low-flow reliability assessment.

- Discoverability and reuse
  - Ensure borehole logs (NP20–NP23) and associated site logs are indexed with consistent terminology and linked to corresponding manipulation plots and land-use treatments where relevant.
  - Archive field sheets and Appendix D measurements in a centralized, queryable repository with clear access rules and versioning.

- Collaboration and network sharing
  - Align metadata schemas with wider data networks to facilitate cross-site collaborations and data sharing across partners.
  - Document field issues, calibration updates, and sensor changes in Field Diaries or equivalent logs to support ongoing data quality improvements.
