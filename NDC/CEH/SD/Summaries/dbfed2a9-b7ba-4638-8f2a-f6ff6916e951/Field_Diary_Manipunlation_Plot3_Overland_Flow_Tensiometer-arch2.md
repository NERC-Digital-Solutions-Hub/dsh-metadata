# Tyn y Fron: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

## Overview
- Field notes documenting tensiometer and overland flow (OLF) trap monitoring, maintenance, and data management from 19/07/05 onward, covering routine checks, repairs, and data issues across multiple plots and depths.
- Focus on data quality, sensor reliability, and challenges affecting environmental monitoring outputs.

## Monitoring components and setup
- Tensiometers deployed at multiple depths (10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) across plots.
- OLF traps with tipping buckets and associated instrumentation (float switches, reed switches, tinytags).
- Data loggers and sensors referenced: Delta-T loggers, Tinytags, TinyTag/reed switch configurations, and desiccants for sensors.
- Regular field activities include degassing tensiometers, recalibrations, battery changes, and wiring repairs.
- Data management activities include data downloads, noting gaps, and marking periods to ignore due to sampling or instrument issues.
- Maintenance events frequently documented alongside plot numbering (Plot 1, Plot 2, Plot 3) and subplots (e.g., 3.1, 3.2, 3.3).

## Data quality and issues
- Weather events (storms) coincide with non-sensible readings across multiple sensors, attributed to electrical surges or flooding in pits.
- Data gaps and lost data common due to:
  - Pump/battery failures and power interruptions (e.g., Delta-T battery issues, monthly downloads; data missing around late 2005 and 2006).
  - Logging software resets or default programming after hardware changes.
  - Tinytag/Tipping Bucket (TB) calibration or operational issues (reed switches, tubing detachments, calibration updates).
  - Delta-T not logging or misrecording tips, requiring re-downloads and recalibrations.
- Sensor and infrastructure problems leading to spurious or irregular data:
  - Tensiometers and OLF cages becoming waterlogged or filled with sediment.
  - Tubing detachments, submerged tensiometer probes, and bent/twisted sensors.
  - Pits flooding due to heavy rainfall or overtopping of trenches.
- Data during rainfall events noted as unreliable and often marked to be ignored or carefully reconciled with calibration data.

## Field maintenance and actions
- Routine degassing and reinstallations of tensiometers; replacement of damaged or missing tensio units; reinstallation after issues.
- Electrical maintenance:
  - Replaced big batteries, adjusted connections to prevent intermittent power loss, and corrected damaged connections on Delta-T loggers.
  - Periodic re-sent logger programs, and re-calibration when batteries or desiccants are replaced.
- OLF-specific maintenance:
  - Repaired or replaced tipping bucket components, reed switches, and tubing; reinforced gutter covers to prevent water ingress and sediment infiltration.
  - Recalibrations and recalibrations of tipping buckets across plots; treated warnings to ignore tips during sampling or maintenance windows.
- Structural and environmental mitigation:
  - Enlarged trenches, deeper pits, and new sump arrangements to manage water and sediment.
  - Protective measures against wildlife (vole damage, fox/badger activity) including gutter repairs, covers, and plastic/worked edging.
  - Periodic reinstallation of tensiometers across plots when components were displaced or damaged.
- Data integrity steps:
  - Cross-checking Delta-T logs with tipping bucket tips, recalibrating when necessary.
  - Replacing Tinytags when data were not recording correctly; cross-checking with local calibration plots.

## Wildlife and environmental challenges
- Wildlife interference includes vole gnawing on wires, chewing cables, bird damage to gutter covers, and nests within gutters or soil pits.
- Sheep trampling around cages causing ground and equipment disturbance.
- Fox/Badger activity potentially creating gaps under fences or ripping protective covers, prompting reinforcement and blocking measures.
- Weather-related challenges include heavy rainfall causing pit flooding, overtopping trenches, and overland flow that can overwhelm traps and pumps.

## Data management and logging notes
- Recurrent need to download and verify data due to intermittent logging, default programs, or corrupted files.
- Observations that data should be reviewed after rainfall events to confirm sensor behavior and correct for anomalies.
- Documentation frequently records “ignore tips” windows during sampling, maintenance, or calibration periods to avoid misinterpretation of transient data.
- Transition between equipment and software (e.g., laptops with different programs) occasionally caused data recording issues.

## Plot-specific observations
- Plot 3 faced recurring issues with 50 cm tensiometers and occasional missing 3.1 measurements; cage movement and water exposure required reinstallation.
- Plot 2 and Plot 3 frequently encountered TB-related problems (blockages, rockers, and sediment accumulation) necessitating pump checks and calibration.
- 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 required periodic replumbing, gutter repairs, and sensor replacements to maintain data integrity.
- Periodic confirmation that "all pits OK" or "all traps OK" was contingent on maintenance outcomes and weather events.

## Key takeaways for analysts monitoring the environment
- Sensor reliability is highly susceptible to weather, wildlife, and power stability; robust QA processes are essential to distinguish true hydrological signals from instrument-induced artifacts.
- Regular, documented maintenance and calibration cycles are critical to minimize data gaps and ensure data continuity (degassing, recalibration, battery management, and component replacements).
- Data interpretation must account for known disruption windows (storms, maintenance, sampling periods) and be validated against cross-sensor checks (Delta-T vs. tipping bucket data).
- Wildlife management and infrastructure protection significantly impact long-term data quality; proactive mitigation strategies are necessary to reduce data losses.
- The dataset spans multiple years and plots, illustrating the need for systematic data logging, consistent metadata capture, and clear notes on when data should be treated as unreliable or omitted due to maintenance or environmental disturbances.
