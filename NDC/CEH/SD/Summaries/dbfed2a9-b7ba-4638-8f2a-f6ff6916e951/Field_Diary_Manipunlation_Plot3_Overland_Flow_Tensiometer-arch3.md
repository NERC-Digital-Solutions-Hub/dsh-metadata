# Tyn y Fron: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

## Overview
- Longitudinal field log (2005–2009) documenting maintenance, troubleshooting, and data collection across tensiometers and OLF (overland flow) traps.
- Focus on monitoring soil water status and hydrology in experimental plots; highlights practical challenges to data quality and continuity.
- Records reveal extensive hands-on activity: installation, degassing, recalibration, re-installation, and ongoing data downloads.

## Data collection and equipment
- Instruments involved:
  - Tensiometers at multiple depths (notably 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) across plots.
  - OLF traps with tipping buckets; associated sensors (float switches, reed/tiny tags).
  - Delta-T loggers, Tinytags/TinyTag sensors, and general data loggers.
- Activities and routines:
  - Regular degassing, wiring checks, and sensor reinstallation when needed.
  - Periodic calibration, battery changes, and replacement of faulty components.
  - Data handling included downloading data, noting missing intervals, and cross-checking readings between devices.
- Field conditions and maintenance events frequently disrupted data (e.g., battery failures, cable damage, animal interference, weather-related flooding).

## Data quality issues and incidents
- Sensor/system faults and anomalies:
  - 19/07/05: Storm event caused electrical surge; all sensors produced nonsensical, identical readings.
  - Recurrent issues with Degassed tensiometers, Delta-T logging stoppages, and Tinytag malfunctions.
- Data gaps and losses:
  - Multiple instances of data gaps due to battery depletion, data download problems, and equipment blocking (e.g., gutters filled with debris).
  - Periods where data labeled as "ignore tips" during maintenance or sampling events.
- Equipment damage and environmental challenges:
  - Animals (sheep, voles, mice, badgers) damaging cables, gutters, and housing structures; nests in gutters.
  - Cages and tensiometer cages moved or damaged; some tensiometers temporarily missing.
  - Waterlogging and flooding in pits; trench overtopping and soil intrusion affecting OLF and TB readings.
- Data integrity efforts:
  - Frequent recalibration and repurposing of components after faults.
  - Cross-validation of tipping-bucket tips with Delta-T and Tinytag readings; recalibration of tipping buckets when discrepancies arose.
  - Documentation of events to inform data interpretation (e.g., “ignore tips” windows during maintenance or high-water events).

## Data management practices and governance
- Emphasis on meticulous field notes to support data interpretation and reproducibility.
- Regular data cleaning and maintenance procedures (degassing, battery replacement, tubing/tubing connections, reed switch checks).
- Documentation of anomalies and corrective actions to contextualize datasets (e.g., noting times to disregard data, calibration updates, and equipment replacements).
- Metadata challenges implied:
  - Complex multi-sensor setup across depths and plots increases metadata needs (sensor type, depth, plot, calibration date, battery type, data logger version).
  - Occasional data loss and equipment changes underline the necessity for clear, standardized metadata and change logs to ensure data traceability.

## Challenges and implications for monitoring frameworks
- Practical challenges:
  - Field data are highly susceptible to weather, wildlife, and equipment wear-life, necessitating robust redundancy and rapid maintenance capabilities.
  - Data integrity requires continuous calibration, verification across multiple devices, and explicit handling of gaps and anomalies.
- Implications for data governance in monitoring frameworks:
  - Importance of comprehensive metadata, calibration and maintenance logs, and standardized data quality checks.
  - Need for transparent handling of missing data and clearly defined protocols for when to ignore or correct data.
  - Value of documenting field-level contingencies to support policy decisions based on environmental health measures.

## Key takeaways for policy-oriented monitoring
- Establish proactive maintenance schedules and redundancy to minimize data gaps.
- Implement standardized, machine-readable metadata schemas capturing device specifics, calibration history, and anomaly annotations.
- Define clear data quality rules and anomaly-handling procedures to ensure data used for decision-making are trustworthy and reproducible.
- Ensure data governance supports open sharing where feasible, with appropriate context provided by field notes and metadata.
