# Introduction to the DATABASE Catalogue

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the Pontbren Database and its instrumentation.
  - Provides a structured, consistent data catalogue to support scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Emphasises data verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and standardized outputs (tables, maps, charts).
  - Encourages data stewardship, with datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

- Data architecture and accessibility
  - Data organized into directories with descriptions of folder contents where needed.
  - Quality assured data accompany each data point with QA codes (see Appendices).
  - Most data provided as .txt files, typically split into six-month blocks; file names indicate collection dates.
  - Appendices provide supplementary information useful for data users.

- Quality assurance and metadata
  - Standard QA coding system (Appendix A) to flag data quality and issues (good quality, calibration issues, logger failures, etc.).
  - Appendices include borehole logs (Appendix B) and neutron probe logs (Appendix C) to support interpretation.
  - Field diaries document data issues and site-specific notes.

- Calibration and site-specific context
  - Some datasets require calibration for site-specific analyses (e.g., Starflow streamflow with manual spot measurements; site-specific linear calibrations).
  - Catalogue includes infrastructure details (instrument locations, site figures) to aid interpretation and replication.

- Data types and coverage
  - Automatic Weather Station (AWS): continuous atmospheric measurements (daily and 10-minute averages; sensor additions post-2009).
  - Bowl study site: runoff and soil water tension data; includes drainage areas, measurement methods, and QA considerations.
  - Groundwater: borehole height and temperature data with barometric pressure correction.
  - Hillslope study site: runoff, drain/overland flow, tensiometers, and shelterbelt overland flow data.
  - Llyn Hir study site: soil water tension data.
  - Land use manipulation plots: data from replicated treatments (Grazed, Ungrazed, Trees); tensiometer and overland flow data.
  - Neutron probe soil moisture: soil profile moisture data with calibration details.
  - Rain gauge data: tipping bucket and storage gauge data across sites.
  - Field diaries: documents with site issues and data notes.
  - Streamflow: Starflow (bed-mounted Doppler) at most sites; alternative methods at others; site-specific calibration parameters provided.

- Notable data considerations and limitations
  - Patchy data due to field issues (rodent damage, calibration constraints, evaporation effects).
  - Water depth below weirs treated as no-flow; explicit notes on sampling frequencies and equipment.
  - Data designed for integration with other datasets to enhance analyses of environmental health and flood risk.

- Structure and contents highlights
  - Structured sections for AWS, bowl site data, groundwater, hillslope data, Llyn Hir, land-use plots, neutron probe data, rain gauges, Field Diaries, and Streamflow.
  - Calibration and site-specific parameters (e.g., Starflow calibration table).
  - Appendices covering QA coding (Appendix A), Borehole logs (Appendix B), and Neutron probe logs (Appendix C).

- Practical use for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Enables standardized, verifiable, and reusable environmental data for longitudinal monitoring.
  - Facilitates cross-dataset analyses with consistent data structures, QA metadata, and calibration details.
  - Supports data sharing and portal deposition to promote broad access and scrutiny of environmental health and policy outcomes.
