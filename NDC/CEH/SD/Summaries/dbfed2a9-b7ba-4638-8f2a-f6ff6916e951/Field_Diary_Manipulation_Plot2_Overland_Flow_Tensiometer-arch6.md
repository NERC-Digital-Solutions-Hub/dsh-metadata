# Rhos2: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

## Purpose and scope
- Field notes documenting visits to monitor tensiometers and OLF (open lysimeters) across plots.
- Covers equipment setup, data logging, maintenance activities, data quality issues, and responses to environmental and wildlife impacts.
- Timeframe spans from 2004 to 2009, with extensive daily/weekly observations, calibrations, repairs, and data sanity checks.

## Equipment and measurements
- Tensiometers at multiple depths (notably 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) across plots.
- OLF (open lysimeter) traps/pits with tipping buckets and associated pumps.
- Data loggers and sensors: Delta-T loggers, Tinytag, TinyTag readouts, reed switches, and associated wiring.
- Supporting infrastructure: OLF gutters, sump covers, trenching, vent checks, desiccants, and battery systems.
- Periodic data checks include degassing, calibration, and data downloads; some data streams flagged as unreliable or require recalibration.

## Data quality issues and anomalies
- Storm events causing widespread non-sensible readings across all sensors, attributed to electrical surge in loggers.
- Recurrent issues with patchy data, double tipping, and tips not aligning with actual events (necessitating data flags to ignore or disregard tips during certain periods).
- Intermittent data loss or corruption due to damaged wiring, chewed connections, or degraded components (e.g., delta-T reed switches, buoy/tipping bucket connections).
- Data gaps from pump failures, blocked pipes, and water in traps (e.g., trap 1 full of water due to battery/pump issues; subsurface flow indications).
- Occasional misalignment of telemetry (e.g., 1-minute vs. 10-minute measurements) requiring recalibration and reconfiguration.
- Specific episodes prompting caution: widespread “ignore tips” notes, and entries documenting “double tipping” and “tips not right” until recalibration or replacement is completed.
- Wildlife-induced data integrity risks (vole activity) leading to frequent electrical/wiring damage and data disruption.

## Maintenance actions and data hygiene practices
- Re-installation of tensiometers at specified depths after losses or poor readings; degassing and recalibration of tensiometers.
- Replacement of tensiometers (e.g., Plot 3 10 cm tensio) and replacement of damanged sensors due to wear or depth issues.
- Electrical and wiring repairs: changed wiring, replaced reed switches, corrected connections, chewed-wiring repairs, and protection measures for wires and tubes.
- Equipment and data hygiene: replacement of desiccants in loggers, battery changes for Delta-T and OLF systems, calibration of tipping buckets, reseating and re-installing tensiometers, and recalibration of TinyTag/TinyTag interfaces.
- Structural and drainage improvements: trenching above OLF traps to divert water, enlargement of pits to handle higher volumes, replacement of gutter covers, and installation of protective housings for pipes and cables.
- Continued data-quality checks: routine data downloads, cross-checks between plots, notes on data that should be disregarded, and periodic confirmations of system health (pump operation, battery charge, and sensor functionality).

## Wildlife and environmental impacts
- Vole activity identified as a major ongoing risk, with multiple notes indicating extensive runways above OLF gutters and widespread damage to wires and sensors.
- Wildlife and weather-related events (storms, animals entering manipulation areas) necessitated protection measures, trenching, and structural adjustments to reduce data disruption.
- Instances of vegetation growth and grass cutting affecting sensor cages and access, sometimes followed by degassing or recalibration.

## Data products and outputs
- Field notes serve as a qualitative record of sensor health, data reliability, and maintenance history to inform data cleaning and later analysis.
- Occasional explicit guidance to ignore or disregard certain data periods (tips) due to calibration or hardware issues.
- Data health snapshots include counts of sensors replaced, pumps repaired, and refits to maintain continuity of time-series data.
- End-state data glimpses (as of 18/08/09) show ongoing measurements across plots (M2.1, M2.2, M2.3) with recorded values for tensiometer depths and related sensors.

## Current status and implications for data
- By mid-2009, multiple sensors remain in use with continued maintenance and recalibration, but data quality is intermittently compromised by environmental and wildlife factors.
- Ongoing need for robust cable/wire protection, wildlife deterrence, and periodic recalibrations to ensure data integrity across tensiometer depths and OLF systems.
- The dataset remains active, with recorded values continuing across plots and depths, though certain periods require exclusion or careful interpretation due to identified issues.
