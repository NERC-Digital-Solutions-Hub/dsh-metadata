# Penllywn: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

- Overview
  - Field monitoring at Penllywn focusing on tensiometers and overland flow traps (OLF) across multiple plots.
  - Timeframe spans the mid-2000s to late-2000s, documenting installations, loggers, maintenance, data downloads, and issue logs.
  - Instrumentation includes tensiometers at various depths, OLF traps with tipping buckets, pumps, gutters, leaf/soil collectors, and data loggers.

- Measurements and instrumentation
  - Tensiometers deployed at multiple depths (e.g., 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) with periodic degassing.
  - OLF traps equipped with tipping buckets, sump tubes, and associated plumbing; loggers track tipping events.
  - Data streams include tensiometer readings, tipping bucket counts, pump status, battery levels, desiccant status, and calibration notes.
  - Data management practices cover logger clock synchronization, channel mappings, and calibration/verification of tipping buckets.

- Data quality, issues, and anomalies
  - Storm events and electrical surges triggered nonsensical sensor readings; such periods are flagged or ignored.
  - Frequent blockages, water in traps/pits, and pump failures leading to data gaps or unreliable measurements.
  - Equipment reliability issues: leaking batteries, desiccants, reed switch failures, wiring faults, and clock resets on loggers.
  - Calibration and data integrity concerns: occasional double tipping, incorrect tip counts, and data mis-timing requiring rechecks.
  - Environmental interferences: ves220 wildlife (vole) damage, trench and gutter blockages, and debris affecting sensors.
  - Data handling practices include discarding data during known faults, marking calibration runs, and re-calibrating/tuning equipment as needed.

- Maintenance, troubleshooting, and actions taken
  - Routine degassing of tensiometers, battery replacements, and desiccant replenishment.
  - Pump maintenance: replacements, wiring repairs, replacements of sump ends, and re-seating downpipes.
  - Tipping bucket and reed switch repairs: recalibration, channel reassignments, and wiring rewiring to correct logging.
  - Physical repairs: gutter covers, downpipes, trench enlargement, cage stabilization, and protection against vole damage.
  - Data hygiene measures: documenting calibration events, downloading data on a regular schedule, and applying exclusion rules for fault periods.

- Data governance and management considerations
  - The logs illustrate substantial data quality management needs: clear criteria for excluding faulty periods, explicit calibration and maintenance records, and thorough metadata.
  - Recurrent issues highlight the importance of robust, fault-tolerant instrumentation and detailed documentation to ensure policy-relevant analyses are reliable.
  - Wildlife and environmental wear underscore the need for durable infrastructure and ongoing maintenance plans.
  - The frequent need to ignore or flag data during faults demonstrates the necessity for transparent data provenance and governance to support downstream decision-making.

- Takeaways for monitoring framework design
  - Real-world monitoring requires proactive data quality protocols, including fault logging, exclusion criteria, and calibration traceability.
  - Metadata about equipment status, maintenance actions, and environmental disturbances is essential for interpreting long-running datasets.
  - Design considerations should include redundancy, easier fault detection, and clear procedures for data cleaning and reporting to support policy insights.
