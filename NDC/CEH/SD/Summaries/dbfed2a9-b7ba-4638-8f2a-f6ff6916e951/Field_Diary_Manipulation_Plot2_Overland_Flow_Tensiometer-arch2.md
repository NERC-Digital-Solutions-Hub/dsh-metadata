# Rhos2: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

## Overview
- Longitudinal field notebook recording tensiometer and OLF (open-filter/related) monitoring across plots from 2004 to 2009.
- Focuses on data quality, sensor maintenance, calibration, and field operations to support reliable environmental monitoring outputs.

## Data Quality Issues and Anomalies
- 19/07/05: All sensors produced identical non-sensible readings after a storm; attributed to electrical surge in loggers; observed across multiple manipulation plots.
- 2006-2008: Recurrent periods of dubious data (e.g., double tips, erratic readings) linked to line wiring, chewed wires (vole activity), faulty reed switches, and desiccant/logger issues.
- 23/03/08 and 27/03/08: Calibrations and data recording gaps due to calibration problems and chewed wiring; significant data loss before remediation.
- 18/03/08 onward: Widespread issues with pit pumps, float switches, delta-T logger connections, and communication between sensors and loggers.
- 15/04/08–30/04/08: Periods flagged to ignore tips during troubleshooting; unresolved wiring and sensor depth variations noted (e.g., tensiometer depths in plots 2.2 and 2.3).
- 2009: Replaced several tensiometers and re-calibrated/redirected logging channels due to persistent non-optimal readings; some components (e.g., TinyTag) removed or relocated due to failures.

## Maintenance, Calibration, and Field Procedures
- Regular degassing of tensiometers and vent inspections; reinstalled tensios at specified depths (often 10 cm) after loss or damage.
- Widespread hardware replacements: batteries (Delta-T loggers, OLF pumps), desiccants, reed switches, float switches, and tensiometers (including 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm variants).
- Rewiring and repair tasks: changed wiring, replaced sump pipes, resealed connections, and replaced or reinstalled tensiometers after damage.
- Sensor and pump maintenance: pump replacements in OLF traps, clearing gutters, addressing blocked tubes, and recalibrating tipping buckets (TB) and TinyTags to correct data anomalies.
- Sediment and soil sampling activities noted (e.g., sediment trap removal) with occasional “tips” observations to be disregarded during certain periods.
- Field modifications to address hydrological issues: trenches dug above OLF traps to divert surface water; enlarging pits to accommodate pumps; installation of new gutter covers and trench maintenance.
- Sheep, vole, and wildlife interactions documented (e.g., sheep grazing near manipulation area; vole damage leading to recurrent wiring and sensing issues).

## Site Challenges and Impacts on Data
- Hydrological disturbances: storm events causing sensor anomalies; pump battery outages leading to water-filled traps and data gaps.
- Biotic interference: voles causing widespread wiring damage and repeated need to shield or replace equipment.
- Physical environment: trenches, erosion, and grass growth affecting sensor exposure and data integrity; ongoing maintenance to ensure proper burial depth and shielding.
- Field operations: occasional access limitations and notes on “tips” timing to avoid data misinterpretation during maintenance windows.

## Data Management and Documentation Practices
- Data downloads and periodic data quality checks are routinely documented; “ignore tips” periods embedded in notes to avoid misinterpretation during maintenance.
- Cross-referencing internal notes (e.g., “Notes from Alex” on sediment sampling) indicating collaborative field support.
- Commitment to recording detailed timestamps, depths, and calibration actions to support traceability and future data cleaning.
- Emphasis on maintaining datasets for portal upload and standardised reporting formats, aligning with environmental monitoring aims.

## End-State and Key Takeaways
- Persistent hardware and environmental challenges necessitated ongoing maintenance, replacements, and recalibrations across multiple years.
- In 2009, targeted replacements and recalibration efforts aimed to stabilize readings (tensiometers, loggers), though vole-related and wiring issues remained prominent threats to data continuity.
- The notes collectively illustrate the importance of robust data verification, redundancy, and transparent documentation to sustain reliable environmental monitoring outputs despite logistical and ecological challenges.
