# Introduction to the DATABASE Catalogue

- Describes the Pontbren Database catalogue, including instrumentation, data organisation, QA codes, and metadata to support discovery, storage, and reuse.
- Data are organized into site- and data-type folders (e.g., AWS, Bowl study site, Groundwater boreholes, Hillslope, Llyn Hir, Land use plots, Neutron probe, Rain gauges, Streamflow, Field Diaries) with descriptive folder metadata and logically named subfolders.
- Emphasises QA codes and provenance, recording QA status and calibration notes to aid interpretation and reuse; aims to support up-to-date, quality-assured data.

## Purpose, scope and governance

- Aims to ensure datasets meet standards, are stored and shared effectively, and are readily discoverable and usable.
- Reflects governance practices for organisations/networks with large datasets; guidance/tools are informed by data creator/sharer and data user needs.
- Highlights updating mechanisms, reporting limitations, and adherence to sharing constraints.

## data structure and organization

- Data grouped by data type and site (e.g., AWS, Bowl, Groundwater boreholes NP20–NP23, Hillslope, Llyn Hir, Land use plots, Neutron probe, Rain gauges, Streamflow).
- Within folders, data are arranged into logically named subfolders (e.g., Bowl runoff, Bowl tensiometers, Groundwater boreholes, etc.).
- QA-labeled data are integrated in the hierarchy; site figures and instrument layouts support interpretation; references to tables/figures aid context.

## Quality assurance and metadata

- Appendices describe QA coding system (Appendix A) with meanings for multiple data types (tensiometers, rain gauges, Starflow, groundwater, weirs, etc.).
- QA codes range from good quality (e.g., Code 1x) to issues (e.g., 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x) and instrument-specific faults (x0–x9).
- QA documentation captures problems like partial data capture, sensor miscalibration, calibration issues, or instrument damage; site-specific calibration notes (e.g., Starflow, neutron probe moisture conversions) are recorded and updated.

## Data content by site and dataset

- AWS: minute-scale data with daily/10-minute averages, including radiation, temperature, humidity, etc.; occasional sensor replacements noted.
- Bowl study site: runoff data (weirs, tipping buckets) and tensiometers at multiple depths; sampling frequency changes and data gaps noted.
- Groundwater: five boreholes with Diver transducers; barometric compensation; height and temperature readings; sampling frequency changes recorded.
- Hillslope study site: overland flow traps, tensiometers, and tree shelterbelt data; patchiness and rodent-related issues noted.
- Llyn Hir: tensiometers at several depths; initial 10-minute sampling later 15-minute intervals.
- Land use manipulation plots: four plots, three replicates, treatments (Ungrazed, Trees, Grazed); tensiometers and overland flow data; plot layouts and treatments documented.
- Neutron probe: soil moisture across multiple site types; readings to ~120 cm; calibration details included.
- Rain gauges: tipping bucket/storage gauges across sites; data reported as mm/day and storage in mm.
- Field Diaries: contextual notes on site/instrument issues.
- Streamflow: multiple gauging sites with Starflow where applicable; site-specific calibration curves relating Starflow to manual measurements; low-flow data may be unsuitable for calibration.
- Appendix D provides extensive streamflow gauging site flow metered measurements with start/finish times and flow estimates (raw and site-specific calibrations).

## Instrumentation and site overview

- Site figures and instrument layouts contextualise readings (Pontbren sites, Bowl instrumentation, Hillslope instrumentation).
- Instruments include weirs, tipping buckets, pressure transducers, tensiometers, neutron probes, rain gauges, Starflow meters, and borehole loggers.
- Documentation covers installation details, array configurations, sensor depths, sampling rates, and calibration procedures.

## Documentation, updates and accessibility

- Datasets are described with folder descriptions, file naming conventions, and metadata to aid reuse.
- Field diaries and appendices provide QA details and context for data curators and users.
- Emphasises updating datasets and uploading to relevant portals with rich metadata to support discoverability and reuse.

## Challenges and governance considerations for data stewards

- Incomplete understanding of user needs can hinder usability.
- Data timeliness and metadata completeness (standards, calibrations, QA) are critical.
- Interoperability challenges due to diverse systems and formats; legacy datasets may require bespoke integration.
- Handling large data volumes and updating legacy databases may necessitate bespoke approaches.
- Routine capture and maintenance of field notes and QA codes to support provenance and reproducibility.
- Ongoing maintenance: refresh QA coding, keep calibration parameters current, and retain site-specific calibration notes (e.g., Starflow, neutron-probe conversions).
