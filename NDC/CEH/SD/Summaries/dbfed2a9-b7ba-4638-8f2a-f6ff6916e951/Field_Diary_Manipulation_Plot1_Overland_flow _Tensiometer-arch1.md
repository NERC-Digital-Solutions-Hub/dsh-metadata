# Rhos1: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

## Overview
- Chronological field notes from Rhos1 detailing tensiometers and Overland Flow Traps (OLF) maintenance, calibration, data collection, and data quality issues from 2005 to 2009.
- Entries include testing, degassing, sensor checks, battery changes, desiccant replacement, and various repairs to keep monitoring equipment functional.
- Tips or data points were edited from raw data files; many entries include comment boxes indicating questionable or discarded data.
- Emphasis on practical challenges affecting data quality and interpretability (storms, moisture, electronics, connections).

## Data collection and structure
- Records are date-stamped narratives describing specific actions, plot references (e.g., Plot 1, Plot 2, Plot 3), and equipment (OLF traps, tipping buckets, tensiometers at multiple depths: 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm).
- Frequent notes about degassing tensiometers, re-installations, and recalibrations of tipping buckets (TBs).
- Data integrity notes appear throughout (e.g., data to be disregarded during certain times; potential reed switch or logging issues).
- Descriptive references to hardware being tested or adjusted (batteries, desiccant, wiring, reed switches, pumps, gutters, covers, vent status).

## Data quality issues and cleaning notes
- Tips and readings were edited from raw data; some periods explicitly marked to be ignored (e.g., during storms, when sensors behaved erratically).
- Weather and electrical phenomena (storm events) linked to nonsensical readings across multiple loggers.
- Moisture-related problems noted (desiccant moisture, logger moisture effects) and subsequent corrective actions.
- Specific calibration and sensor orientation issues identified (e.g., reed switches recording incorrectly when oriented wrongly; certain tips not logged).
- Variability in tensiometer readings attributed to installation conditions (ground level height differences across depths).

## Field maintenance and operational issues
- Recurrent maintenance tasks:
  - Degassing and re-installation of tensiometers; adjustments at specified depths.
  - Replacing or repairing OLF tipping buckets, pump components, float switches, and reed switches.
  - Cleaning and clearing gutters, trap holes, and trenches; removing vegetation and debris.
  - Battery changes (including external batteries for pumps and Tinytag data loggers) and desiccant replacement.
  - Destruction or damage events (vole damage, broken nets, bent frames) with subsequent repairs.
  - Calibration activities and hardware checks (calibration sheets referenced).
- Structural and environmental challenges:
  - OLF trap holes filling with water; blocked gutters requiring intervention.
  - Pumps and floats occasionally failing or sticking; reed switch glitches affecting tip data.
  - Described interventions to prevent data loss (e.g., recalibrations, replacing problematic components, guarding against moisture).

## Calibration and measurements
- Calibration notes include specific tipping bucket counts and sequences (e.g., TB1: 20,5,5,5,5; TB2: 6,6,7,7,7; TB3: 7,7,8,8,7) and periodic recalibrations (noting times and results).
- Calibration checks often tied to ensuring correct tip counts and verifying loggers record tips reliably.
- Records document continued measurement of tensiometers at multiple depths (M1.1, M1.2, M1.3; at 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) with occasional updates on their functioning and position.
- Notable entries describe issues where calibrations indicated faulty readings (e.g., reed switch problems) and subsequent recalibration of affected TBs.

## Data handling and metadata
- Logs frequently mention data downloads and cross-referencing with calibration sheets; references to Tinytag data and external battery configurations.
- Frequent directives to ignore certain data windows and to verify data integrity during post-processing.
- Final entries include explicit notes on removing tensiometers and recording their serial numbers and locations for traceability.

## Notable events and interventions (by theme)
- Storm and electrical effects: multiple instances where readings become sensible again after logger interventions; data flagged as unreliable during or after events.
- Sensor and switch failures: reed switch misalignment, stuck float switches, and TBs not recording correctly; multiple rounds of recalibration and hardware replacements.
- Maintenance campaigns: systematic updates to batteries, desiccants, covers, gutters, and pit structures; trench enlargement and protective measures against animal damage.
- Data validation efforts: regular checks for tip recording accuracy, calibration calibration sheets, and notes to disregard questionable tips.

## Implications for data analysis
- Expect substantial data cleaning needs due to edited tips, sensor anomalies, and period-specific exemptions.
- Multi-depth tensiometer data may require alignment corrections where height differences and installation issues affected readings.
- Data integration across plots and years will need careful handling of:
  - Periods flagged as unreliable or discarded
  - Recalibration events and hardware changes
  - Metadata documenting battery changes, desiccant status, reed switch orientation, and pump configurations
- Clear provenance and metadata are essential to interpret long-term trends given the field-maintenance-driven data edits.
