# Rhos1: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

## Overview
- Field notes documenting tensiometers and overland flow (OLF) traps at Rhos1 from 2005 to 2009.
- Describes routine maintenance, troubleshooting, calibrations, and data-related decisions impacting data quality and usability.

## Data quality, metadata and governance implications
- Data edits and data quality flags: tips recorded in raw files sometimes edited or marked as invalid; notes specify when data should be disregarded (e.g., during maintenance or anomalies).
- Sensor and system reliability challenges: storms or electrical events causing nonsensical readings; moisture in loggers affecting desiccant; reed switch faults; pump and float switch failures.
- Data gaps and obstacles: traps/pits becoming full of water or clogged gutters; vole damage to hardware; blockages requiring cleaning or repair.
- Calibration and validation burden: frequent recalibrations of tipping buckets; cross-referencing with tinytag and delta T logs; documenting calibration results and issues.
- Metadata and provenance needs: extensive intervention logs (dates, actions, observed issues) essential to interpret measurements; ongoing need to link maintenance events to data quality assessments.
- Implications for governance: demonstrates necessity for clear SOPs, consistent metadata capture, QA/QC processes, and data versioning to support data sharing and policy-relevant analysis.

## Equipment, maintenance and operational practices
- Tensiometers: deployed at multiple depths (e.g., 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm); regular degassing, re-installations, and corrections after issues; grass cutting and site maintenance to ensure measurement integrity.
- OLF traps and tipping buckets: numerous maintenance actions including pump repairs/replacements, reed switch checks/replacements, valve and drain adjustments, and calibration updates.
- Power and sensors: battery replacements, desiccant changes, desiccant/moisture management, and external power supplementation where needed.
- Physical site management: trench widening, pit enlargement, vole damage mitigation (covers, boxes), gutter repairs, and network-wide voltage/battery management.
- Documentation and traceability: frequent notes on which data should be ignored and why, alongside hardware changes and calibration events to maintain traceable data lineage.

## End state and key takeaways for monitoring frameworks
- By 2009, field operations show ongoing maintenance and calibration with documented sensor statuses and serial numbers (e.g., M1.1, M1.2, M1.3) for tensiometers.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Robust QA/QC logs that tie data points to maintenance and calibration events.
  - Comprehensive metadata to enable data usability despite frequent field interruptions.
  - Clear procedures to handle and annotate data during known issues (e.g., “ignore tips” periods, sensor recalibrations).
  - Provisions for hardware reliability, redundancy, and rapid repair to minimize data loss.

## Notable extractable outcomes for policy-oriented monitoring design
- Emphasizes need for standardized metadata schemas capturing equipment status, interventions, environmental conditions, and data edits.
- Underlines the value of explicit data provenance to support credible decision-making and transparent data sharing.
- Demonstrates real-world challenges in maintaining long-term environmental monitoring networks and the resulting implications for data governance, accessibility, and interpretation.
