# Tyn y Fron: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

- A longitudinal field log (2005–2009) detailing field visits to monitor tensiometers at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depths and Overland Flow (OLF) tipping buckets, along with Delta-T and Tinytag loggers.
- Objectives reflected in the notes: attach/degass sensors, download data, maintain equipment, record environmental events, and troubleshoot data anomalies.

## Overview of activities and equipment

- Sensor types and roles:
  - Tensiometers at 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm depths for soil water tension.
  - OLF tipping buckets (TBs) with Delta-T and Tinytag loggers for overland flow measurements.
  - Reed switches, pump sump systems, and chemi-battery-powered loggers (Delta-T, Tinytag).
- Data collection and maintenance patterns:
  - Regular degassing, recalibration, battery replacements, and occasional cable/tubing repairs.
  - Data downloads frequently noted; occasional gaps and periods marked as data to be ignored (e.g., during testing or suspected misreads).
  - Frequent field notes documenting hardware issues, weather impacts, and logistics (grass cutting, trench work, wildlife impacts).

## Key data quality challenges observed

- Weather and environmental disruption:
  - Storm events causing sensor readings to become nonsensical.
  - Heavy rainfall leading to flooded pits and overland flow, complicating interpretation.
- Hardware and data integrity issues:
  - Delta-T and Tinytag logging problems (batteries, connectors, default/incorrect program states).
  - Tensiometer/tipping bucket hardware faults: tubes dislodged, reedswitch failures, penny/nut glue on components, and cables damaged by wildlife.
  - Pits often full of water or blocked gutters; sediment buildup in traps affecting tipping buckets.
- Data gaps and reliability:
  - Recurrent data gaps or data download issues (e.g., 27/11/05 gap, 5–7/12/05 missing, data lost during battery/connection problems).
  - Periods where tips were to be ignored due to calibration/calibration-related issues or during sediment sampling.
- Wildlife and terrain factors:
  - Vole, fox, and badger activity causing damage to tensiometers, gutter covers, cables, and trench integrity.
  - Gaps under fence lines and damaged lawn edging contributing to uncontrolled water ingress or equipment exposure.
- Maintenance complexity across plots:
  - Three plots (3.1, 3.2, 3.3) requiring ongoing repair and reinstallation of tensiometers; confusion over which tensio is present in certain plots due to prior replacements.

## Temporal progression of notable issues and responses

- 2005:
  - Initial storm-related data anomalies; multiple re-installations and degassing activities.
  - Several instances of sensor/logger data gaps and hardware misreads noted.
- 2006:
  - Ongoing loggers and trench maintenance; repeated battery changes; troubleshooting of Delta-T and OLF systems.
  - Frequent cleaning, vent checks, and recalibration; calibration notes tied to tipping buckets.
- 2007:
  - Intensified maintenance due to equipment aging, reed switch glitches, and sediment issues; several entries document replacement and recalibration of components.
  - Data integrity periods affected by battery failures and environmental disturbances.
- 2008:
  - Major wildlife interference (voles, birds) and vandalism-like damage; gutters damaged; trenches enlarged; frequent replacement and recalibration of tensiometers.
  - Notable data irregularities in Delta-T and Tinytag readings; several “ignore tips” windows and recalibration events.
  - Efforts to shore up installation, cover gutters, and stabilize data collection across plots.
- 2009:
  - Continued system checks, re-calibrations, and data integrity assessments; improvements noted in some loggers but other units still exhibited intermittent issues.
  - Final notes emphasize ongoing need for monitoring equipment integrity and addressing drainage and wildlife-related damage.

## Implications for data analysis and interpretation

- Data quality is highly contingent on field conditions and hardware reliability; significant data cleaning and flagging are required.
- Correlations between soil water tension, OLF events, and rainfall are confounded by:
  - Frequent data gaps, misreads during storms, and periods of deliberate data exclusion.
  - Variability in sensor integrity due to wildlife interference and equipment wear.
- Cross-plot comparisons require careful metadata on:
  - Sensor depths, exact plot configurations, calibration dates, and any replacements.
  - Events triggering data suppression (e.g., calibration, sediment sampling, or sensor faults).

## Recommendations for data handling and future fieldwork

- Data quality flags:
  - Implement explicit quality flags for each sensor reading, noting storms, battery changes, and known faults.
  - Mark data during periods labeled “ignore tips” or known calibration/calibration-related anomalies.
- Hardware resilience:
  - Strengthen wildlife protection (gutter covers, fencing, wire protection) and secure cabling to prevent damage.
  - Regular battery health monitoring and a pre-storm readiness check to minimize post-storm data gaps.
- Data management:
  - Maintain a detailed event log aligned with data timestamps (rainfall, pump downtime, recalibrations) to aid post hoc interpretation.
  - Ensure consistent labeling of sensor configurations across plots and document any replacements with clear metadata.
- Analytical approach:
  - Treat data as multi-source, with synchronization challenges across Delta-T, Tinytag, and tensiometer datasets.
  - Focus analyses on periods of stable hardware operation and use flagged periods to assess potential biases.
