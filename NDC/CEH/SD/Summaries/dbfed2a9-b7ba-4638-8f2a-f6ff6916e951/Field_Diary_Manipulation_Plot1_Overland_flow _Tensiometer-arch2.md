# Rhos1: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

- Overview
  - Longitudinal field log documenting maintenance, calibration, and data integrity activities for tensiometers and overland flow (OLF) traps across multiple plots (Rhos 1).
  - Equipment involved includes Delta-T loggers, tensiometers, OLF traps, tipping buckets, reed switches, float switches, pumps, batteries, desiccants, and tinytags.
  - Data management emphasis: raw data often edited (tips removed or annotated), with comment boxes noting data quality issues or corrective actions.

- Data and Measurements
  - Recurrent testing and degassing of tensiometers; changes in readings frequently tied to field interventions or environmental events.
  - Storms and electrical disturbances occasionally yield nonsensical or unstable sensor outputs across multiple loggers; re-calibration and re-installation followed.
  - OLF traps frequently experience waterlogging and gutter blockages (e.g., by leaves, worms), affecting water flow and tipping-bucket readings.
  - External sampling and sediment collection occur (e.g., trenching, soil sampling) with notes that certain tip data may be affected or should be disregarded during those periods.

- Calibration, Validation, and Data Integrity
  - Regular calibration of tipping buckets; adjustments noted (e.g., spacing of tips, reed switch orientation) due to misreads or double tipping.
  - Several instances of misrecorded tips due to reed switch orientation, magnet placement, or faulty wiring requiring re-calibration or part replacement.
  - Data flagged as suspect during certain windows (e.g., “ignore tips between” specific times); calibration sheets referenced for verification.
  - Tinytag logging introduced or adjusted at multiple points; occasional need to install external batteries or re-route connections for reliability.

- Maintenance and Field Procedures
  - Routine tasks: degassing tensiometers, cutting grass, clearing gutters, replacing desiccants, changing batteries, repairing or replacing pumps, and replacing faulty components (float switches, reed switches, fuses, nuts, and connectors).
  - Structural and envelope maintenance: repairing pit covers, enlarging trenches, installing sump covers, and protecting equipment from vermin damage.
  - Operational adjustments: re-inserting tensioon heads, re-calibrating TBs, replacing tubing and elbows, and relocating or realigning OLF components to ensure flow paths remain functional.
  - Documentation practices: extensive in-field notes with timestamps, plot identifiers, and explicit commands to disregard certain data segments during maintenance windows.

- Data Management and Accessibility
  - Data quality is actively managed through inline commentary in the field notes (e.g., “Tips should be disregarded,” “ignore data between collected in the morning,” “Calibration sheet” references).
  - Data are downloaded and cross-checked in situ; updates to hardware and software configurations are logged to support traceability.
  - Regular updates to sensor health and plot status are recorded to support downstream analysis and quality assurance.

- End-of-Period Observations and Implications
  - The dataset reflects substantial ongoing maintenance requirements to preserve data integrity in field conditions, with weather, biological factors, and hardware wear repeatedly impacting measurements.
  - For analysts monitoring environmental health, the notes illustrate:
    - The necessity of robust data cleaning protocols and explicit documentation of data exclusions.
    - The value of calibration records, equipment inventories, and maintenance logs to support long-term trend analyses.
    - The importance of clear data provenance when integrating environmental datasets from multiple monitoring components.
  - Recommendations evident from the log:
    - Maintain and periodically review calibration sheets; ensure reed switch orientations are documented and standardized.
    - Continue routine sensor maintenance (batteries, desiccants, seals, covers) and implement quicker cross-checks after storm events.
    - Continue annotating data with reasons for edits or exclusions to enable transparent, reproducible analyses and facilitate sharing through monitoring portals.
