# Rhos2: Notes from field visits for tensiometers and OLF

- A longitudinal field notebook of field visits (2004–2009) documenting tensiometer and OLF (open liquid flow) system maintenance, data issues, and operational responses across plots.
- Emphasizes hands-on maintenance, data quality challenges, and adaptation to environmental interference (weather, wildlife) to keep a complex monitoring setup functioning.

## Overview of systems and activity

- Systems tracked:
  - Tensiometers at multiple depths (10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) across plots.
  - OLF (open liquid flow) trapping and associated sensors (tipping buckets, pumps, float switches, reed switches, tinytags).
- Activities documented:
  - Sensor degassing, vent checks, and depth verification.
  - Battery changes, desiccant replacement, and general power management.
  - Cable, pipe, and component repairs (pipes, sump repairs, gutter covers, wiring).
  - Data logger maintenance and recalibration (Delta-T loggers, Tinytags, TinyTags, reed switches, and calibration notes).
  - Physical interventions to manage drainage and water flow (trenches, widening pits, diverting water above OLF gutters).
  - Routine field tasks (grass cutting, weed control, litter removal) and observational notes (vole activity, sheep, thistles).

## Key data quality issues observed

- Recurrent non-sensible readings across sensors attributed to storm-related electrical surges affecting loggers.
- Data gaps and unreliable readings due to:
  - Pump failures, battery failures, and desiccant depletion.
  - Water in traps/pits and gutter blockages, causing data discrepancies or unusable periods.
  - Vole damage to wires, pipes, and gutters leading to intermittent or lost data.
  - Reed switch/wiring problems and chewed cables causing loss of tip data or misrecorded tips (double tipping, tips recorded at incorrect times).
- Calibration and data integrity challenges:
  - Occasional double tips, miscalibrations, and need for recalibration of tipping buckets and tensiometers.
  - Intermittent Tinytag and Delta-T logger issues requiring data exclusion windows ("ignore tips" periods) and cross-checks with hardware changes.
  - Notes indicating data requiring “ignore” periods or exclusion due to sensor problems, moisture, or wiring faults.
- Metadata and governance implications:
  - Frequent notes about confirming which data are trustworthy, which tips to disregard, and which sensors should be considered faulty.
  - Explicit recording of hardware changes and maintenance to support future data interpretation and quality assurance.

## Maintenance and operational actions

- Sensor and data hardware maintenance:
  - Regular degassing and vent checks; reinstalled tensiometers at various depths; multiple tensio replacements (10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm).
  - Replacement of OLF components: sump covers, detectors, tipping buckets, and related tubing.
  - Battery management and replacement of big batteries; desiccant changes and wiring repairs.
  - Replacement and calibration of reed switches, float switches, and associated wiring (including addressing chewed wires by voles).
  - Recalibration and reinstallation of tensiometers and delta-T devices; resetting tiny tags and clocks.
- Structural and drainage interventions:
  - Trenches dug to divert surface or subsurface water away from OLF traps and troughs.
  - Enlarged pits for housing pumps; repaired or replaced gutters and trench covers to reduce water ingress.
  - Installation of protective measures (covers, guards) to mitigate vole and weather impacts.
- Data handling and cleaning:
  - Periodic data downloads, time synchronization, and recalibration due to erroneous data.
  - Documentation of reliable vs. suspect data periods; explicit flags to ignore certain data or tips.
  - Cross-plots and cross-sensor checks to ensure consistency across depths and loggers.

## Data management implications for monitoring frameworks

- Demonstrates the need for robust data governance when field-logged environmental data are collected with multiple heterogeneous sensors and prone to environmental interference.
- Highlights importance of:
  - Comprehensive metadata (sensor depths, calibration status, maintenance events, and known data gaps).
  - Protocols for flagging and excluding suspect data, plus clear documentation of when and why exclusions occur.
  - Redundancy and resilience in sensor networks (e.g., multiple sensors, backup loggers, and protective cabling) to mitigate wildlife and weather-related failures.
- Shows long-term maintenance requirements and iterative learning to improve data quality, including preemptive measures (vole-proofing, weatherproofing) and rapid response to hardware failures.

## Recent observations and measurements (selected highlights)

- 2008–2009 notes reflect extensive troubleshooting and hardware updates in response to recurring faults (e.g., pump failures, chewed wiring, and delta-T/tipping bucket calibration issues).
- Specific operational updates:
  - March 2008: vole activity identified as a major problem; recommendations for diverting OLF water and protecting wiring.
  - Early 2009: issues with T1.10 (non-working) and 2.30 (sensor wiring/dessicant concerns); reallocation to alternate logger channel; tensiometer replacements (2.50, 3.30) as needed.
- Latest measurements (from 2009 data excerpt):
  - M2.1: 10 cm = 180, 30 cm = 388, 50 cm = 210.
  - M2.2: 10 cm = 230, 30 cm = 238, 50 cm = 255.
  - M2.3: 10 cm = 179, 30 cm = 216 (noted with asterisk), 50 cm = 213.
- Overall trajectory shows continued data collection with ongoing hardware refreshes and careful data cleaning due to environmental and wildlife challenges.
