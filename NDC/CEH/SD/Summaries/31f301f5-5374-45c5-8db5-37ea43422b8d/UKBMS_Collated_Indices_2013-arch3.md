# Experimental design/sampling regime

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) collects data from over 1,000 sites annually across the UK, primarily using fixed-line transects ("Pollard walks") to enable year-to-year comparability.  
- All-species transects involve recording butterflies along a fixed route, typically 2–4 km long, divided into habitat/management sections, with ~26 counts per year from April to September. Counts occur only under suitable weather (clear, dry, wind < Beaufort 5, temperature thresholds with sunshine or overcast conditions).  
- Single-species transects follow the same methodology but focus on one focal species for one or more weeks during its flight period.  
- Additional methods include timed counts (abundance over a set period/area) and egg/larval web counts in suitable habitats.

- Transect data are collected on standard forms and entered into Transect Walker software, either directly by the recorder or by a regional transect coordinator. Regional coordinators consolidate data, which are then uploaded to an Oracle database.

- Transects are selected to sample habitat types and management activities evenly; routes are fixed to maintain comparability across years.

- Data quality and validation occur at multiple stages, including automatic checks in Transect Walker and regional/ automatic/manual validation procedures to flag unusual counts, out-of-range records, records outside normal flight periods, first-time site records, and extreme abundances.

- The data flow supports later statistical analysis to derive site and national indices, feeding into annual updating of national indicators.
