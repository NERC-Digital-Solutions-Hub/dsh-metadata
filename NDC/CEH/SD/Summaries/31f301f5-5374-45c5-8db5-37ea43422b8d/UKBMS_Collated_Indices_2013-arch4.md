# Experimental design/sampling regime

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) collects data from over 1,000 sites across the UK annually.
- Core methods include all-species transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route line transects, recorded weekly under suitable weather, with transects designed to sample habitat types and remain fixed year to year for comparability.
  - Typical transect length: 2–4 km; 45 minutes to 2 hours to complete; divided into habitat/management sections.
  - Counts cover all butterfly species within a fixed 5 m wide band along the transect, from early April to late September (ideally 26 counts per year).
  - Weekly counts occur within specified weather windows: check times between 10:45 and 15:45, with conditions such as dry weather, Beaufort wind < 5, and temperature thresholds (≥13°C with ≥60% sunshine, or ≥17°C if overcast).
- Alternative/ supplemental methods include:
  - Single-species transects (same methodology as all-species but focused on one focal species for one or more weeks).
  - Timed counts (abundance of a focal species over a set period and area).
  - Egg/larval web counts (counting eggs or larval webs in suitable habitat for specific species, e.g., Marsh Fritillary).
- Data collection and flow:
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms.
  - Records are entered into Transect Walker (free software) by the recorder or regional transect coordinator.
  - Transect Walker files are uploaded to an Oracle database housing all records.
  - Each transect coordinator assembles data for all sites within their region after each monitoring season.

- Data collection constraints and considerations:
  - Transects are fixed to enable year-to-year comparability.
  - Weather and time windows are strictly enforced to ensure consistent sampling conditions.

- Key implications for data governance:
  - The design supports spatially representative sampling across habitats and management types.
  - Data are structured to support subsequent statistical analysis and national-scale indices.
