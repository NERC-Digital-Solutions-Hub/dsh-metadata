- Environment and platform
  - R version: 3.5.3 (2019-03-11)
  - OS: Windows 10 x64 (64-bit)
  - Locale: English (United Kingdom) for collation, ctype, monetary, and time; numeric in C
  - Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64
- Base and attached packages
  - Base attached: grid, stats, graphics, grDevices, utils, datasets, methods, base
  - Other attached (representative): openxlsx, sets, dplyr, changepoint, zoo, lubridate, tseries, ggplot2, shinycssloaders, shinyjs, shiny
- Namespaces loaded (examples of dependencies)
  - Packages and dependencies such as zip, Rcpp, pillar, compiler, later, xts, tools, digest, jsonlite, lattice, tibble, gtable, pkgconfig, rlang, crosstalk, curl, yaml, stringr, htmlwidgets, DT, tidyselect, glue, R6, TTR, purrr, magrittr, scales, promises, htmltools, quantmod, assertthat, mime, xtable, colorspace, httpuv, labeling, quadprog, stringi, lazyeval, munsell, crayon
- Purpose in context
  - Demonstrates that the application and analysis routines for environmental monitoring were tested with a standard set of data manipulation, time-series, visualization, and web-delivery packages to ensure compatibility and reproducibility of outputs.

- Key takeaways for monitoring practice
  - Verification across a robust ecosystem of R packages supports data cleaning, time-series analysis, and clear outputs (reports, charts, and interactive elements).
  - Emphasizes the importance of using established sources and standardized tools to generate transparent environmental health outputs.

- Purpose in context
  - Confirms compatibility of the same environmental monitoring application with an updated set of R packages and newer versions to support data processing, visualization, and web delivery.

- Key takeaways for monitoring practice
  - Updated package ecosystem maintains capability for data manipulation, time-series analysis, export, and interactive presentation.
  - Maintains alignment with UK English locale settings and Windows platform, ensuring consistency in data formatting and reporting across environments.
  - Highlights ongoing importance of using well-supported packages (e.g., dplyr, ggplot2, zoo, tseries, changepoint, shiny) to generate transparent, reproducible environmental health outputs.
