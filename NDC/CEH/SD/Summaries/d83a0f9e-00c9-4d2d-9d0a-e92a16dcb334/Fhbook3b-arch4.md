# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Provides national-time series field survey protocols for vegetation, soils, and freshwater biota to inform policy and biodiversity indicators.
- Emphasizes standardized data collection, coding, and QA to ensure comparability across observers, plots, and survey cycles.
- Supports integration of plot- and map-based data (including BAP frameworks) for policy reporting.

## Purpose, scope, and data governance
- Update and extend national land-use datasets as time-series to monitor ecological change and link to policy frameworks.
- Maintain core time-series by re-surveying core squares and adding new ones, with standardized data quality control.
- Establish robust data pipelines, metadata, and discoverability (format, quality, metadata, updates) to support national reporting and networks.

## Data architecture: plots, data types, and mapping
- Plot types covering diverse habitats:
  - X PLOTS: large 200 m2 plots with nested 4 m2 subplots for detailed data.
  - Y PLOTS, U PLOTS, B PLOTS, A PLOTS, H PLOTS, D PLOTS, S & W PLOTS, R & V PLOTS: variously sized and targeted to capture habitat, boundaries, hedgerows, streams, verges, and arable margins.
- Data captured includes: species lists, cover estimates, plot locations, GPS coordinates, and map-based feature changes.
- Two broad habitat concepts for change detection:
  - Mappable Broad Habitats (broad categories)
  - Plottable Broad Habitats (finer categories requiring additional plots)
- Change handling links field forms to BAP maps; changes may affect parcel codes or require new parcels.

## Permissions, access, and field logistics
- Permissions are mandatory; landowner contact and background materials prepared in advance.
- Clear relocation and marking rules in case of changes or access issues; emphasis on goodwill and accurate ownership records.
- Equipment provisioning and safety responsibilities defined; standardized field procedures for efficient surveying.

## Data recording, codes, and quality assurance
- FABs (Field Assessment Booklets) form the core data collection tool; standardized coding and mapping boxes.
- Consistent taxonomic framework (nomenclature aligned with standard references; optional post-survey conversions).
- Detailed plot-level sheets with nested plots, species recording, and GPS data where possible.
- Change detection rules: document changes with new parcel numbers and appropriate codes; reflect mergers/splits on data forms and theme maps.
- QA emphasizes observer training, field-handbook adherence, and cross-checks between FABs and maps.

## GPS data collection and annex guidance
- Annex 1 provides step-by-step GPS data collection to ensure precise relocation and improved time-series integrity.
- Procedures cover satellite checks, stationary vs moving logging, file naming conventions, data-rate settings, and handling PDOP (accuracy) considerations.
- File naming requires square ID and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE) for traceability; feature-based files use distinct identifiers.
- Tips on maintaining data quality, including ensuring clear sky views and minimizing obstructions.

## Photography, documentation, and reference features
- Cameras provided to document vegetation plots; films replenished as needed.
- Photographs should clearly show plot position relative to obvious, permanent reference features; include square/plot identifiers on a visible board.
- Photography standards aim to capture representative plot appearance and facilitate future relocation.

## Sampling programs and coordination with external bodies
- Three sampling domains:
  - Soil sampling and Calluna (soil chemistry, soil fauna, microbial status)
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by Institute of Freshwater Ecology)
- Soil sampling in every X-plot within 1 km squares: five replicate samples per square; details on collection depth, pipes, packaging, and shipping to ITE Merlewood.
- Calluna sampling to assess foliar nitrogen as a potential indicator of nitrogen deposition; standardized collection, drying, labeling, and shipping.
- Coordination with IFE for freshwater work; scheduling and timing aligned with field teams.

## Post-survey procedures and data delivery
- After each survey day, data sheets must be checked for omissions; avoid excessive re-drafting unless necessary.
- FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE stations promptly.
- Final data integrity relies on timely data transfer, consistent coding, and preservation of original forms.

## Taxonomy, data quality, and feature recording
- Emphasis on consistent taxonomy and careful handling of difficult identifications; genus-level entries permitted when necessary.
- Bryophyte and lichen recording is selective with defined scope; other taxa may be excluded to maintain standardization.
- Detailed guidance on recording new features and linking to GPS and FABs for traceability.

## Key considerations for Data Leaders
- Build robust, standardized data pipelines across plots, fields, and surveyors to ensure cross-time comparability.
- Balance time-series continuity with enhanced spatial resolution via Plottable vs Mappable habitats to support biodiversity policy programmes.
- Implement stringent access permissions and data governance to minimize data loss and field inefficiencies.
- Leverage integrated mapping, plot data, and QA processes to support national policy reporting, including biodiversity action plans and environmental indicators.
- Invest in observer training and cross-checks between FABs and maps to maintain data quality and consistency over time.
