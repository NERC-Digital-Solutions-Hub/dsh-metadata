# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year continuum of developing the ITE Land Classification.
  - Emphasises that the current methodology is inseparable from its predecessors and that understanding earlier concepts is essential.

- Core concept: stratified sampling and the ITE Land Classification
  - Stratified, random sampling is used to avoid bias and ensure samples are representative of ecological variation across Great Britain.
  - The ITE Land Classification provides the stratification framework, grouping land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to capture ecological differences.

- Origins and evolution of the ITE Land Classification
  - Began in the 1970s with the Lake District work, using vegetation quadrats and Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to classify land into environmental types.
  - 1 km squares were chosen as sampling units for national scale surveys, with centres of 15 x 15 km grids used for initial classification (1228 centre squares; expanded to 6039 squares with surrounding squares).
  - 32 Land Classes were defined initially, each described by average environmental characteristics.
  - Over time, the classification was revised to improve regional and policy relevance, while maintaining comparability with earlier surveys.

- Survey milestones and corresponding sampling frameworks
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification and first field survey)
    - Used ISA-based 32 classes with eight samples per class (256 total) drawn from classified squares.
    - National habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class times the class area.
  - CS1984 (Second field survey)
    - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (384 total); relied on 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
    - Land Classification extended to classify every GB square; urban and sea corrections applied.
    - 508 squares surveyed; included repeat vegetation quadrats from 1978 and new data.
  - Between 1990 and 2000
    - Significant refinement of the Land Classification to enable regional and local estimates; some squares changed class, reducing exact correspondence with the original 1228-squares framework.
  - CS2000 (Fourth field survey)
    - Introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) by subdividing classes into country-unit versions and aggregating where necessary to ensure adequate representation.
    - 40 strata created; added 19 new squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; uplands habitat module added for England and Wales to improve upland estimates.
  - CS2007 (Fifth field survey)
    - Wales-only reporting recognized as a priority; adjusted land classes to create five new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expanded Wales sampling to ensure at least six squares per Welsh class.
    - England classes 5e and 15e remained with reduced representation (four squares) but considered acceptable per scoping studies.
    - Overall set expanded to 45 strata; 43 additional squares surveyed in Wales; England sampling unchanged in number of additional squares.

- Practical data outputs and representation
  - Across surveys, tables summarize the number of sample squares by Land Class and country, illustrating how sampling effort is distributed to achieve country-specific estimates.
  - Figures map the revised Land Class frameworks and sample locations, reflecting ongoing adjustments for Wales and Scotland reporting.

- National estimates and data consistency
  - National estimates are calculated as the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - Changing the basic Land Classification across surveys affects GB-wide estimates; two approaches are noted:
    - Use the latest classification for GB consistency (which can complicate cross-survey comparability).
    - Retain the original classification for cross-survey comparability (less consistent with current data structure).
  - The document provides detailed tabular comparisons showing how sample sizes per class evolved under different classifications.

- Uplands and country-specific reporting
  - An uplands module was introduced to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.
  - Wales was given particular attention for Wales-only reporting, prompting sub-division and augmentation of Welsh data to ensure robust Wales-specific estimates.

- Summary of methodological trajectory
  - Early reliance on a fixed 32-class Land Classification derived from a limited sample of squares, expanded over time to include all GB squares and country-specific reporting.
  - Progressive adaptations to improve regional and policy relevance, including separate country estimates, Wales-only reporting, and upland modules.
  - Ongoing balancing act between classification stability for longitudinal analysis and the need for finer, country-specific granularity.

- Key implications for data leaders
  - Data strategy should favour a stable yet adaptable classification framework with clear documentation of changes and their impact on time-series analyses.
  - When planning longitudinal data products, consider implications of reclassification on comparability and establish guidelines for cross-survey consistency.
  - Ensure robust metadata and provenance to support country-specific reporting (England with Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only outputs) and future policy needs.
  - Maintain transparency about sample allocation, strata definitions, and sampling rates to facilitate auditability and external validation.
  - Foster cross-team collaboration to align ecological sampling with policy requirements and to manage evolving data products (e.g., upland modules and country-specific estimates).
