# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on and integrates with the ITE Land Classification, a stratification system used to ensure representative samples across Great Britain.
  - Aims to support national, regional, and country-specific estimates of habitats and land use through stratified, random sampling and robust data collection.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representativeness and reduce bias.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) define land classes used to allocate samples.
  - National estimates are derived by combining average habitat area per square within each land class with the total area of that class (and repeating this across time-series).

- Early development and the sampling framework
  - 1978 (CS1978): Introduced the ITE Land Classification with 32 classes derived from 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1,228 classified; plus four surrounding squares). 256 squares sampled (8 per class) for vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
  - 1984 (CS1984): 2nd field survey increased samples to 12 squares per class (384 total). Used the 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (CS1990): All-Squares Land Classification implemented; 508 squares surveyed. Introduction of Land Cover Map (from satellite data) and repetition of the 1984 quadrat dataset. Classification revised to cover every GB square, though with conservative updates.

- Developments and improvements to the land classification
  - 1998 (CS1990→CS2000): Land Classification extended to classify every GB square using surrogates for climatic, geological, and physiographic factors. Classification changes led to some reallocation of squares; some classes under-represented in the new scheme.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Emphasis on separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) and the need for adequate representation across countries. Framework changes included sub-dividing land classes into country-unit versions, aggregating sparse classes, and adding squares to ensure coverage of new classes. A uplands module was added to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
  - Wales-focused considerations: Wales required more Wales-only reporting; adjustments created additional Welsh classes and increased Welsh sampling to support country-specific estimates.

- Separate country estimates and sampling adjustments
  - England with Wales and Scotland were treated as distinct country units for reporting.
  - Land Classes were subdivided into country-unit variants (creating new sub-classes) and, where necessary, re-aggregated within each country.
  - Additional squares were allocated to ensure representation of new or redefined classes in each country; Isle of Man sampling squares were replaced to maintain country-focused reporting.

- 2007 adjustments and Wales-specific reporting
  - To support Wales-only reporting, five Welsh country-unit sub-classes were introduced (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), expanding strata to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional sample squares; England did not receive compensatory increases in all cases.
  - Some English classes ended up with as few as four squares, but scoping work indicated this was acceptable for reporting purposes.
  - The revised land-class maps reflect England with Wales and Scotland for CS2007 sampling.

- Uplands module (CS2000 onward)
  - An additional module placed 30 squares in uplands and marginal uplands to improve statistical precision for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales where separate country estimates were required.

- Outputs and data considerations
  - National estimates are computed using class-level means multiplied by class land area, with time-series consistency considerations when classifications change.
  - The document notes potential comparability issues when switching between land classifications (e.g., 1990 original vs. latest classification) and recommends using the latest classification for within-survey consistency.
  - Detailed tables (e.g., Tables 2–4 and Tables summarizing squares per class and per survey) document the numbers of squares, strata, and sampling rates across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, including country-specific breakdowns and the evolving sampling framework.

- Summary timeline of key milestones
  - 1978: 32 Land Classes; 256 squares sampled; national estimates via class-area method.
  - 1984: 384 squares; increased per-class sampling; continued use of 1978 classification for estimates.
  - 1990: All-Squares Land Classification; 508 squares; alignment with Land Cover Map data; broader GB coverage.
  - 1998: Revised Land Classification with Scotland reporting; 40 classes; 569 squares surveyed.
  - 2000: CS2000; country-unit reporting introduced; 40 strata expanded to 45; upland module added; Wales-focused adjustments.
  - 2007: CS2007; Wales-specific country-unit sub-classes implemented; 43 additional Welsh squares; adjustments to England classes; expanded Wales sampling for Wales-only reporting.
