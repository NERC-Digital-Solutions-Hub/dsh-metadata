COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

Overview
- Purpose: Assess consistency and reliability of the fieldwork in the Countryside 2000 survey to ensure data quality for discovery and use.
- Scope: QA on 38 of 519 squares (selected) with one quarter re-surveyed, covering 234 species plots across nine plot types.
- Focus areas: Relocation efficiency, species concordance, vegetation cover estimates, bias in habitat-change detection, and comparability with CS1990.

Methodology (Key points)
- Plot relocation: Buried plates used to relocate plots; relocation performance compared to CS1990 and prior QA exercises.
- Species records: 6000+ original/QA records analyzed to assess concordance; assessors distinguished management/seasonal effects from recording errors.
- Vegetation cover: Visual cover estimates (>5% for dominant species) compared between CS2000 surveyors and QA assessors.
- Land-use and land-cover mapping: Comparison of primary codes, descriptive/landscape codes, and boundary features; Annex details protocol and codes.
- Change assessment: Evaluation of changes recorded between CS2000 and QA, and attribution of observed changes to real change vs. recording artefacts.
- Plot types: Quadrats, X/Y/U plots, road verges, streamsides, hedges, arable margins, etc., with attention to plate/plot relocation and boundary markers.
- Data collection and documentation: Annexes outline formal procedures for replication and QA measurement; results tabulated by square and plot type.

Key QA Findings
- Plot relocation efficiency
  - 86.7% recovery rate for full plot relocation; eight-year relocation comparable to 12-month relocation in prior QA.
  - CS2000 surveyors precisely relocated 60% of CS1990 plots; ~25% relocated acceptably; ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - Y-plots (habitat plots) hardest to relocate (higher failure rate).
  - Overall, 9 of 14 plates recovered; total estimated plot relocation success approximately 40–45% for exact plate recovery, with broader location overlap higher.
- Species concordance and records
  - Mean species per plot increased from original CS2000 to QA (CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4 across all plots); many increases attributed to longer species lists produced by QA assessors.
  - For all plots, CS2000 QA concordance of species presence: ~71% confirmed by assessors; ~2% non-concordances due to management/seasonal changes.
  - When considering all plots, efficiency of recording equates to about 87–90% for various plot groups, with clear differences by plot type.
  - Key mis-match types: overlooked species (largest single contributor to mis-matches ~14–40%), mis-identifications (notably grasses), orientation/location errors, and occasional over-zealous or incorrect recording.
  - Some species-level frequency changes were substantial, with notable discrepancies in mosses and certain grasses; under- or over-recording tended to cluster by species group and plot type.
- Vegetation cover estimates
  - Overall cover values showed substantial agreement for many species, but certain grasses (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum) exhibited significant cover differences between CS2000 and QA; some differences linked to seasonality.
  - For several common species, cover concordance remained reasonable (e.g., Lolium perenne), while other taxa showed poorer agreement.
- Direction of vegetation change
  - DECORANA axis scores showed no significant directional bias between CS2000 and QA; axis shifts largely attributable to location/orientation and cover-mismatch issues rather than real directional change.
- Land-cover and boundary mapping
  - Primary land-cover codes: high concordance overall; excluding BAPs, 91.6% concordance; BAP codes added 77.4% concordance; overall primary land-cover agreement ~87.5%.
  - Boundary features: high concordance for boundary-related codes; primary boundary concordance ~92.0%; overall boundary feature concordance ~67.5% due to omissions and hedge-wall coding nuances.
  - Hedge codes (Annex): hedge shapes/new codes had limited success; many hedges coded under a single code (374) and several omissions occurred.
- Boundary/land-use change
  - Change concordance was relatively low: overall change concurrence ~51.4%; substantial portion of change not noted by CS2000 or not substantiated by QA assessors.
  - Many changes noted by CS2000 were not confirmed as real changes by assessors, indicating potential misinterpretation or coding issues; a proportion of actual changes since 1990 may have been missed.
- Arable plots
  - Very limited arable plots in the sample; concordance was poor, likely due to seasonal variation and lower recorder familiarity with ruderal/arable taxa; suggests the need for multiple visits for arable margin plots.
- Overall data quality indicators
  - Change coding and recording show room for improvement; but mapping and primary habitats show strong agreement, indicating robust baseline data for many components.
  - No overall directional bias detected in mean axis scores; but plot-type and land-class differences exist in axis scores, reflecting sampling and recording challenges.

Data Governance Implications for Data Stewards
- Provenance and traceability
  - QA demonstrates the necessity of documenting field methods, plate/plot locations, and changes to boundary/habitat codes for future data users.
- Data quality controls
  - Evidence supports maintaining permanent plot markers or more robust relocation marks to improve long-term comparability.
  - Standardized coding and cross-checks are essential to minimize mis-identifications, location/orientation errors, and overlooked species.
- Metadata and documentation
  - QA outcomes should be archived with the primary CS2000 data, including QA concordance metrics, plot- and plot-type-specific biases, and change-record conventions.
- Interoperability and updating
  - Given the observed changes since 1990 and the seasonality effects, update workflows should capture timing of surveys and align cover classification with standard bands across time.
- Data sharing and usability
  - Provide access to QA metrics (concordance rates, axis-score changes, boundary and land-use concordances) to aid users in assessing reliability for analyses over time.

Recommendations for Data Stewards
- Strengthen geospatial and boundary practices
  - Improve placement/marking of plot corners and plates; maintain updated sketch maps and photographs to facilitate relocation.
- Enhance data coding discipline
  - Standardize coding for plant taxa, boundary types, hedge shapes, and land-use changes; minimize OOV (out-of-vocabulary) or ambiguous codes.
- Expand arable plot sampling
  - Include more arable margin plots with well-timed visits to reduce seasonal mis-match and improve concordance.
- Document and communicate QA results
  - Publish QA metrics alongside the CS2000 dataset; include plot-type-, land-class-, and species-level concordance data to inform users about reliability and limitations.
- Ongoing monitoring and iteration
  - Use QA findings to refine field protocols (e.g., for color/seasonal effects on cover estimates) and to improve future surveys’ consistency and comparability with past data.
