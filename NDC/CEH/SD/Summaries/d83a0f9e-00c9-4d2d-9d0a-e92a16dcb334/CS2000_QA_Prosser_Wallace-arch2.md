# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Aim and scope
- Assess consistency and reliability of the Countryside 2000 field programme due to multiple recorders and surveyors.
- Focused QA on 38 of 519 squares from 1998, with one quarter of each square resurveyed (234 plots across nine CS2000 plot types).
- Evaluated: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, reliability of percentage cover estimates, bias in detecting habitat change, comparability with CS1990, land-use mapping accuracy, and recording of changes.

## Methods and scope
- Selection: 38 squares, with 34 previously included in 1990 CS sub-sample; seven main plot types analyzed as quadrats and linear plots.
- Plot relocation: buried metal plates marked in 1990; relocation attempted eight years later using sketch maps, photographs, and detectors.
- Data collection and coding: standard CS2000 procedures, including land-use mapping and boundary coding; Annex A/B protocols referenced.
- Change assessment: evaluation of changes in land cover and boundary features since 1990, distinguishing real change from coding or recording differences.

## Key QA findings

### Plot relocation
- 86.7% of searches recovered full plots; 60% accurately relocated; ~25% relocated approximately; ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate recovery by QA assessors: 69.3% of plates found; total potential recovery estimated around 40–45% (range depending on category). For CS2000, several plots/plates were found in close proximity to earlier positions, illustrating relocation challenges after eight years.

### Species concordance and recording accuracy
- Approximately 6,000 records across 210 plots showed:
  - About 71% of records confirmed as present in resurvey; 2% non-concordant due to management/seasonal changes.
  - Initial CS2000 recording accuracy estimated around 73%, similar to 1990 CS (adjusted for plot relocation issues).
- Overall mean species per plot increased in QA compared with CS2000:
  - CS2000 mean: ~17.9; QA mean: ~20.4 (roughly a 2–3 species difference per plot).
- Larger discrepancies often linked to plot location/orientation rather than survey effort alone.

### Vegetation cover
- QA typically produced longer species lists; some notable cover differences:
  - Holcus lanatus: CS2000 mean 10.2 vs QA 7.2 (significant at p = 0.029).
  - Dactylis glomerata: CS2000 9.3 vs QA 5.9 (p = 0.005).
  - Anthoxanthum odoratum: CS2000 6.7 vs QA 3.6 (p = 0.040).
  - Eriophorum vaginatum: CS2000 23.3 vs QA 11.8 (p = 0.018).
- For several species, differences reflected seasonal timing and plot location rather than fundamental recording bias.

### Land-cover mapping
- Primary land-cover codes: high concordance between CS2000 and QA.
  - Overall primary land-cover agreement: 87.5% (including BAP codes; excluding BAP codes, concordance rises to 91.6%).
  - BAP (broad habitat) codes: 77.4% concordance.
  - Land-use primary boundary codes: substantial concordance (92.0% for code concordance; total boundary concordance around 85.0%).
- Mapping of land-cover changes since 1990 shows challenges:
  - Change concordance: 51.4% overall.
  - Change not noted by CS2000: 33.9%.
  - Change recorded but not substantiated by assessors: 14.7%.
  - Conclusion: many changes since 1990 may have been missed; CS2000 changes tended to rely on field coding, with assessor verification highlighting gaps.

### Hedge diversity and boundary features
- Hedge-diversity plots (H plots) showed relatively high total species counts and recorded a notable proportion of “overlooked” species.
  - Total hedge species recorded: 124; common species 92.
  - Overall agreement: 74.2%; surveyor efficiency: 77.4%.
- Primary boundary features and land-use boundary coding
  - Primary boundary code concordance: high (92.0% for code concordance; total boundary concordance ~85.0%).
  - Boundary shape and hedge codes (annexed codes 374–380) had mixed success; some mis-matches related to changes in hedge/wall condition and the presence/absence of boundaries.

### Arable plots
- Only five arable plots were evaluated; results were inconclusive.
  - Concordance between CS2000 and QA was very poor, likely reflecting seasonality and lower familiarity with ruderal/arable weed communities.
  - Recommendation: consider multiple visits to arable margins to improve reliability.

### Changes in overall ecosystem metrics
- DECORANA ordination indicated no directional bias in changes between CS2000 and QA across plot types and land classes.
- When aggregating across plot types, axis-1 changes were not systematically biased, although individual plots varied due to localization, recording, and cover-rating differences.

## Implications for environmental monitoring

- Strengths
  - High accuracy in land-cover and boundary coding, with concordance comparable to or better than previous QA exercises.
  - Overall approach demonstrates robust standardization and the value of QA in validating large-scale environmental monitoring.
  - No evident directional bias between original surveys and QA results; changes observed are largely consistent with natural variability or measurement error.

- Limitations and caution
  - Plot relocation and accurate plate/plot localization remain challenging over multi-year intervals; relocation efficiency affects concordance and change detection.
  - Species lists tend to be longer in QA, with some systematic mis-recording linked to plot location/orientation and seasonal timing.
  - Change detection between 1990 and 1998 shows substantial gaps; many changes may be missed in field coding, underscoring the need for meticulous change verification.
  - Arable margin plots require more intensive sampling to achieve reliable results.

## Recommendations for monitoring practice

- Enhance plot relocation protocols and documentation to reduce location/orientation errors, including explicit handling of linear plots and boundary-sharing plots.
- Maintain standardized training and field handbooks to minimize mis-identification and mis-location-related discrepancies.
- Improve capture of changes by incorporating more explicit change-capture procedures and cross-verification between surveyors and assessors.
- Increase sampling intensity for arable margins and hedgerows to better reflect seasonal dynamics and species turnover.
- Ensure robust data management and access to underlying data to facilitate cross-analysis and reproducibility.

## Data quality and archiving

- The QA exercise provides a comprehensive benchmark for the reliability of CS2000 data across plot relocation, species recording, vegetation cover, land-cover mapping, and boundary coding.
- Results support continued use of CS2000 outputs for environmental health and policy evaluation, with attention to the identified sources of error and the recommended improvements.
- Data and protocols (including Annex A/B references) support future monitoring cycles and comparative analyses with subsequent surveys.
