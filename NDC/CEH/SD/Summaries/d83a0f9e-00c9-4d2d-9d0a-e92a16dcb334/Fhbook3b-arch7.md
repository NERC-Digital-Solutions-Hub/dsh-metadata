# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Purpose: define standardized, time-series, map-based data products describing land use, habitats, vegetation and landscape features across GB; emphasizes field standardization, data quality, and GIS integration.
- Scope: builds on CS1990; fixed 1x1 km squares; GB-wide sampling (568 squares); outputs support policy frameworks (Biodiversity Action Plans, Habitats/Species Directives) and UK/EU biodiversity indicators.

## Sampling design and field operations
- Six ITE Research Stations coordinate field teams; each team surveys ~95 squares; typical square survey ~4 days.
- Sampling plan emphasizes continuity: re-sampling old squares to maintain time series; adding new squares to cover new classes; upland expansion.
- Sampling grid uses class-based stratification with ongoing quality control to reduce observer variation.

## Data collection framework and outputs
- Core components: mapping, plots recording (vegetation), and sampling.
- Mapping: de novo mapping for new squares; map-change only for previously surveyed squares; reports align with broad habitats and biodiversity frameworks.
- Output structure: three mapping levels (Mappable Broad Habitats and Plottable Broad Habitats), thematic OS map layers, data-recording forms, and BAP maps for habitat translation.
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB): consolidates data and maps for each square, including ownership, physiography, land use, plots, boundaries, buildings, roads, recreation, and universal codes.
- GIS relevance: standardized codes, parcel linking, and relocation coordinates to enable change detection and spatial integrity over time.

## Mapping, data recording and GIS integration
- Mapping uses standard codes on enlarged 1:10,000 maps; primary (dominant) codes first; custom codes allowed only with notes.
- Aerial imagery available to aid identification; API conventions exist but field judgment is primary.
- Parcels and changes: parcel codes link CS1990 FABs; “New Parcel Numbers” use alpha prefixes (e.g., P, A, F, B, S) and are updated on maps and data forms.
- Change-detection: old squares use CS1990-based broad habitats (Mappable vs Plottable) with upland often Plottable plus U plots.
- Ponds: optional ponds maps for lowerland squares; ponds tracked against 1990 baselines.

## Plot types and vegetation data
- X plots (Wally plots): 200 m2 with nested 4 m2 inner plot; five nested plots per square; relocation via metal plates; permanent marking.
- Y plots: 2 m x 2 m plots; five plots per square; relocation protocols.
- U plots: unenclosed plots; up to 10 per square; 4 m2 plots; distributed across broad habitats.
- B plots: boundary plots (200 m2) for vegetation change along field boundaries.
- A plots: arable field margin plots (100 x 1 m) extending into fields; no permanent marking required.
- H plots: hedgerow plots (10 x 1 m); record species and canopy; two plots per square when hedgerows present.
- D plots: hedgerow diversity plots (30 x 1 m); woody species inventories.
- S & W plots: streamside and waterside plots (10 x 1 m); additional water-side sub-plots.
- R & V plots: roadside and verge plots (10 x 1 m); verge-type adaptations; additional plots when verge width > 2 m.
- Location rules emphasize: distances between plots, alignment with land features, and avoidance of new plots near existing plots.

## Vegetation recording and species data
- Species recording: standard forms list ~200 common species; record present species and nested plot; estimate cover in 5% classes; add unlisted species with Latin names.
- Bryophytes and lichens: restricted lists with prescribed cover classes.
- Data quality: cross-checking between observers, notes for ambiguous identifications, consistency with prior CS datasets.

## Data products and outputs for GIS
- Core GIS outputs: time-series of land cover and landscape features; broad habitat maps aligned with BAP frameworks; plot-level vegetation data (upland/enclosed gradients).
- Documentation tools: FABs, theme maps, BAP maps, and data-recording forms for traceability and auditability.
- Relocation and change-tracking: robust parcel-numbering and relocation markers (metal plates, GPS, photographs) to maintain spatial integrity across years.

## Field procedures, permissions and logistics
- Planning: flexible scheduling to minimize travel; survey old squares in the same sequence as 1990 where possible.
- Permissions: obtain landowner consent prior to fieldwork; procedures for refusals and partial access with guidance on continuing or replacing squares.
- On-site workflow: assess square on arrival; confirm access; plan route for full coverage; ensure records are complete and reviewed.

## Equipment and field readiness
- Equipment provisioned for field teams; emphasis on care and accountability; safety and field recording supplies (FABs, GPS, maps, camera, markers, etc.).
- Equipment distribution: some items allocated by regional coordinators; safety documentation maintained.

## Special sampling components (Soil, Calluna, Freshwater)
- Soil sampling (Section 10.2–10.7): five replicate soil samples per 1 km square, collected from X-plots; three cores per X-plot; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing; detailed field procedures and packaging included; samples mailed in prescribed envelopes/containers.
- Calluna sampling (Section 10.8–10.10): foliar nitrogen sampling to identify regions with nitrogen deposition exceeding critical loads; collects CYG shoots (30–50 g) from Calluna vulgaris plants within squares; samples despatched to ITE Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11): coordinated with Institute of Freshwater Ecology; concurrent with CS2000 fieldwork; IFE staff may work in squares.
- Despatch and handling: clear instructions for labeling, packaging, and posting samples; receipts and reimbursement procedures.

## Photography
- One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks.
- Reference features: obvious, unique, permanent, and viewable in future visits.
- Labeling: include square and plot numbers on a visible board in each photo; composition guidelines to avoid excess sky.

## Procedures after survey
- Post-survey data checks: read data sheets to ensure no features are omitted; avoid transcription-only corrections unless necessary.
- Transportation: arrange timely transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations.

## Annexes and GPS data
- Annex 1: GPS data collection guidance (battery power, satellite checks, PDOP targets, stationary vs moving logging, file naming conventions, etc.).
- GPS data management: standardized file naming (square + plot id), handling of almanac updates, and strategies to minimize obstruction and datum errors.
- Additional references: guidance on maps, nomenclature, universal codes, and pond/reference datasets.

## Common GIS challenges and considerations
- Proactive standardization to minimize observer variation; rely on a comprehensive field Handbook.
- Integrating data from multiple sources/resolutions; harmonizing with satellite imagery and ground-truthing.
- Managing large/complex datasets via modular plot types and structured FABs for GIS-ready attributes.
- Ensuring precise plot relocation over time via metal plates, GPS, and detailed notes to support reliable change detection.
