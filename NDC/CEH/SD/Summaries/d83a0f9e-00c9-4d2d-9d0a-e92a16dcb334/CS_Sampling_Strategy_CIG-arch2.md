# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and baseline
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification, first used in 1978 to stratify a national field sample.
  - Emphasises stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage and enable time-series analysis of environmental change.

- Core concepts and motivation
  - Stratification (strata) to reduce bias and capture ecological variability across different land types.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) define land classes used for sampling.
  - Use of 1 km square sample units; centre square as the primary sampling unit with surrounding squares assigned to classes for classification consistency.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) as a multivariate method to group land into environmental classes.

- Historical evolution of the Land Classification and sampling framework
  - 1978 (Initial Survey)
    - ISA-based classification created 32 land classes from 1 km squares (centre of a 15 x 15 km grid).
    - Sample: eight squares per class (256 squares total) surveyed for vegetation and soils.
  - 1984 (Second land-use survey)
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total).
  - 1990 (All-Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Included integration with the first Land Cover Map derived from satellite data.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; CS1998/CS1990 updates)
    - Enhanced framework to enable Scotland-only reporting; land classes increased to about 40.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Scoping and adjustments for policy relevance; introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland).
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata created with class aggregation where needed.
    - 19 additional squares added to ensure adequate representation; upland habitat module introduced to improve England/Wales upland estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-specific reporting formalised; Welsh sub-divisions created (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure six squares per Welsh class.
    - England adjustments: some English classes reduced in per-class square counts but overall precision deemed acceptable.
    - Wales gains additional representation while Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates.
    - Output remains compatible with prior series for trend analysis while enabling Wales-only and England-with-Wales reporting.

- Land Classification and sampling framework details
  - Land Classes
    - Original 32 classes (1978) described by environmental characteristics (e.g., undulating country, coastal plains, mountain bogs, arable land).
    - Subsequent expansions increased to around 40 classes by 1990 and up to 45 classes by 2007, with country-unit subdivisions for England, Wales, and Scotland.
  - Sample design per survey
    - 1978: 8 squares per class; total 256 squares.
    - 1984: 12 squares per class; total 384 squares.
    - 1990: all GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed.
    - 2000: 40 strata; country-unit subdivisions created; additional upland squares added for improved precision.
    - 2007: 45 strata; Welsh class sub-divisions; 43 Welsh extra squares; England class adjustments to maintain reporting precision.
  - Country-unit reporting
    - Distinct England-with-Wales vs Scotland estimates; Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates and replaced within England.
    - Wales-specific adjustments increased Welsh sampling to support Wales-only reporting.

- Uplands module
  - CS2000 introduced an uplands module with 30 extra squares in upland/marginal areas of England and Wales.
  - Purpose: improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in country-specific reporting.

- Outputs, data, and interpretation
  - Outputs are generated by applying the mean habitat area per square within each land class to the land-class area (i.e., area-weighted national estimates).
  - Results include maps, tables, and the Countryside Survey main reports; national estimates align with historical classifications to support time-series analyses.
  - Data integration across survey years required careful handling due to evolving Land Classification; the report discusses approaches to maintain consistency for GB-wide estimates and country-specific reporting.

- Key considerations for analysts
  - Changes in the Land Classification across surveys affect national estimates; consistency strategy preferred for GB-wide analyses while allowing country-specific comparability.
  - The framework supports long-term trend analysis but requires careful mapping between different classifications (e.g., 1990 vs 2000 vs 2007) to ensure comparability.
  - Emphasis on expanding dataset value through country-unit reporting and, later, through upland modules to improve precision in policy-relevant outputs.
