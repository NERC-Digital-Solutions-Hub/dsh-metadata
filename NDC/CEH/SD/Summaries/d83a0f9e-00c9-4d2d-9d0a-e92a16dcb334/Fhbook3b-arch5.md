# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview for Data Stewards
- Standardizes data capture for land cover, vegetation, and landscapes across Great Britain as part of the CS2000 field survey series.
- Aims to support policy, biodiversity action plans, and trend analyses through high-quality, comparable, and well-documented data.
- Emphasizes data governance, metadata, traceability, and long-term data usability across large, multi-year datasets.
- Integrates data from three sampling streams (soil,Calluna, freshwater) collected in collaboration with ITE and IFE, ensuring consistency in coding, formats, and documentation.

## Data Governance, Metadata, and Change Tracking
- Establishes a structured, codified data model linking data collection forms (FABs), plots, and theme maps for full traceability and reproducibility.
- Tracks changes between CS1990 and CS2000, including new parcel numbers and commentary on updates to features or boundaries.
- Prioritizes data quality control, observer consistency, and standardization to minimize inter-observer variation across years.
- Supports longitudinal analyses by maintaining system for change tracking, gap handling, and clear documentation of atypical cases.

## Sampling Framework and Scope (Contextual Summary)
- CS2000 expands time-series sampling across standardized 1 x 1 km squares, with a focus on land cover, landscape features, and vegetation dynamics.
- Involves multiple field teams and coordination with research stations to ensure representative coverage and consistent methodologies across England, Scotland, Wales, and adjacent areas.
- Sampling strategies include maintaining continuity with previous surveys, representing new land-cover classes, and addressing upland and boundary considerations.

## Planning, Site Visits, and Logistics
- Flexible scheduling for field teams with emphasis on minimizing redundant visits and optimizing travel efficiency.
- Seasonal consistency by returning to squares in a consistent sequence to preserve time-series integrity.
- Proximity-based sampling for new squares to neighboring known land-cover types to maximize survey efficiency.

## Equipment, Data Handling, and Documentation
- Central provisioning of field equipment (GPS, FABs, maps, plotting tools, etc.) with clear responsibilities for care and reporting damage.
- Data capture emphasizes neat, legible records linked to unique square and parcel identifiers; standardized forms and plots designed for traceability.
- Documentation includes mapping, plotting, and vegetation recording aligned with theme maps to support coherent data governance.

## Field Procedures and Data Capture

### Soil Sampling (Section 10.11 and related)
- Purpose: national soil baseline data for indices of soil biological activity, diversity, and chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals).
- Sampling design: within each 1 km square, five replicate soil samples from centre plots (X-plots) across cores and depths, processed at ITE Merlewood.
- Equipment: plastic pipes (long black for chemistry, short white for fauna and microbiology), aluminium plates, trowels, jams, and labelled envelopes for shipping.
- Procedure (center plot, 2 x 2 m): locate North corner, sample 15 cm north with long black pipe, then two additional samples 15 cm east and 15 cm west from the first position; post samples in labelled envelopes; keep samples in a cool box; ship promptly.
- Documentation: record precise locations, parcel IDs, and any field notes about conditions (e.g., roots, dense vegetation).
- Despatch: ship white pipes (short) and bags in SAEs to Merlewood; keep chemistry pipes for regional collection.

### Calluna Sampling (Section 10.9–10.10)
- Objective: assess foliar nitrogen concentrations to infer regions with nitrogen deposition relative to Calluna vulgaris critical loads.
- Sampling within squares: select current-year growth (CYG) shoots from Calluna vulgaris plants; collect 30–50 g fresh weight; seal and label bags; allow slight air exchange if wet.
- Despatch: either despatch from the ITE research station or post directly to ITE Merlewood; obtain receipts for reimbursement.

### Freshwater Sampling (Section 10.11 and Section III)
- Coordination with Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff; sampling occurs concurrently with ITE activities.
- IFE coordination ensures sampling in appropriate time windows and locations within squares.

### Photography (Section 11)
- One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and context relative to landmarks.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and distinctive; each photo includes square/plot identifiers on a board in frame.
- Framing guidance emphasizes including plot markers and features while avoiding excessive sky.

### Procedures After Survey (Section 12)
- Post-survey data checks: review data sheets for omissions; avoid re-transcribing data unless necessary due to damage or loss.
- Transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly to maintain data integrity.
  
## GPS Data Collection (Annex 1)
- Detailed, step-by-step GPS data collection procedures to ensure accurate geolocation for plots and features.
- File naming: create square-plot-specific names (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to clearly identify the square and feature.
- Data logging: stationary plotting and boundary recording with explicit steps for starting, stopping, and saving logging data.
- Battery, almanac, and PDOP considerations to ensure reliable positioning (PDOP ideally below 6 for 3D fixes).
- Handling obstructions: strategies to improve signal acquisition (repositioning, aerial extension) and best practices for entering and navigating attribute codes.
- Attribute reference sheet: quick-mapping of plot identifiers (e.g., X1, D1, S1, W3) to specific codes for efficient data entry.

## Annexes, Supporting Elements, and Data Scope
- Annexes include GPS data collection guidelines, pond mapping references, and vegetation/land-use code keys to support longitudinal comparability.
- Emphasizes compatibility with prior data and long-term datasets, including pond surveys and Lowland Pond Survey mappings.
- The handbook provides explicit protocols for data capture, coding, change-tracking, and mapping, enabling robust governance of large-scale ecological data suitable for policy support and scientific analysis.

## Key Takeaways for Data Stewards
- Ensure consistent, well-documented data capture across soil, Calluna, and freshwater sampling streams.
- Maintain traceable data lineage through linked FABs, plots, and theme maps; document all changes and updates.
- Adhere to standardized field procedures, GPS data practices, and photographic documentation to support reproducibility and future comparability.
- Manage data quality proactively with clear roles, equipment provisioning, and timely transport of samples and FABs to central facilities.
