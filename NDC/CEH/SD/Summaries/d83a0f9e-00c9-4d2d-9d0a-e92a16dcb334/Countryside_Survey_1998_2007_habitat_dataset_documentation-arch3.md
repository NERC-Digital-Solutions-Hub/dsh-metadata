# Countryside Survey mapped estimates of Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1998 and 2007

## Overview
- National estimates of Broad Habitat percentage change for Great Britain between 1998 and 2007, calculated using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Estimates are summarized by Broad Habitat (1-17) and by Land Class.
- Mapping methodology described in Maskell et al., 2008; Barr, 1998.

## Data content and scope
- File: CS98_07_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp details.
- Provides percentage increase or decrease of area by Broad Habitat across 17 categories.
- Columns include LC2007 (ITE Land Class), LC2007_COD, SURVEY (years), and 17 habitat-type percentage change fields (Column1–Column17).
- Habitats span from Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodland to Urban, plus intermediate categories like Coniferous Woodland, Grasslands, Heath, Wetlands, Rivers/Streams, Montane, Inland Rock, etc.

## Methodology and provenance
- Estimates derived from the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Mapping methodology described in Maskell et al., 2008; Barr, 1998.
- National estimates generated from Countryside Survey field data (1 km squares) with statistical treatment described in Scott, 2007 (CS Technical Report No.4/07).

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates linking field-mmapped habitat change to national-scale indicators.
- Illustrates data provenance, classification schemes, and how to standardize changes over time.
- Highlights data governance considerations: metadata availability, reproducibility, sharing, and required acknowledgements.

## Practical notes for implementation
- Ensure proper citation and acknowledgement when reusing.
- Review supporting documentation for metadata quality and methodological details (Maskell 2008; Scott 2007).
- Plan for data alignment with other datasets if integrating across classifications or time periods.
