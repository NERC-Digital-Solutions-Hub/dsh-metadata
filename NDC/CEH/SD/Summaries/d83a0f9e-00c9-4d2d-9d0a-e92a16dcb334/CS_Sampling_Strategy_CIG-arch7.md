The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

Overview
- Describes the evolution and rationale of the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field work up to the 2007 survey.
- Emphasises that the current methodology is built on a 30-year lineage of land classification and stratified sampling, and remains tightly linked to its predecessors.
- Highlights the role of spatially explicit, map-based stratification (ITE Land Classification) in designing representative samples and deriving national estimates.

Land Classification and Stratification
- ITE Land Classification: a key environmental stratification system developed to partition Great Britain into discrete strata for ecological survey.
- Origin: from environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) applied to 1 km squares; initial 32 classes created using Indicator Species Analysis on a subset of squares.
- Purpose: ensure samples reflect the diversity of landforms and land-use types, reducing bias inherent in purely random sampling.
- Classification evolution: progressively expanded and refined to cover all GB squares, with adjustments to match new data and policy needs.

Sampling Frameworks by Countryside Survey (CS) Year
- CS1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - Used ISA-based 32 land classes.
  - Sampled 8 squares per class across 256 squares, selecting center squares and surrounding four squares to form representative strata.
  - National estimates for habitat areas derived by class means times class land area.
- CS1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Increased sample to 12 squares per class (384 total).
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification and Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to cover all 1 km squares; introduced urban and sea corrections.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats from 1978 plus new features recorded.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; national estimates still based on the revised 1990 classification.
- CS1990 Developments (Classification Refinement)
  - Recognized need for finer regional/local estimates; attempted to classify every GB square using surrogates for major climatic, geological, and physiographic factors.
  - When re-classifying, some squares changed class; overall class characteristics remained stable, but distribution across classes was affected.
- CS2000 (Separate Country Estimates and Expansion)
  - Responded to policy needs for England & Wales vs Scotland reporting; introduced country-unit versions of Land Classes and 40 strata.
  - Added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation across new classes; added 11 more to balance England/Wales representation.
  - Wales-specific refinements: Land Class 17 subdivided in Wales to improve Wales estimates; Isle of Man samples replaced to avoid affecting country-unit estimates.
  - Included an uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
- CS2007 (Welsh-only Estimates and Wales-specific Adjustments)
  - Aimed to deliver Wales-only reporting; introduced five new country-unit subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increased Wales sampling.
  - Expanded to 45 strata; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure minimum representation per Welsh class.
  - England adjustments limited; some English classes retain lower sampling (e.g., 4 squares) but justified by scoping studies.
  - Wales uplands module retained; class map updated for England, Wales, and Scotland.

Uplands and National Estimates
- Uplands Module (CS2000+): added 30 squares specifically in upland and marginal upland areas to improve precision of upland habitat estimates within country units.
- National vs country-specific estimates: ongoing balance between using a single GB classification for national estimates and country-specific classes for country reporting; consistency vs comparability considerations are acknowledged.

Data, Outputs, and Interpretation
- Outputs are map-based and rely on the ITE Land Classification to define sample strata and weight estimates.
- National estimates are derived from class-level statistics and land-area proportions, with careful attention to changing classifications over time.
- The report notes that changing the underlying Land Classification can affect the comparability of national stock estimates; the preferred approach for consistency is to use the latest classification for GB-wide estimates while acknowledging historical classifications for trend interpretation.

Notes on Methodology and History
- The strategy emphasizes stratified, random sampling to capture ecological and land-use variability across GB.
- It documents iterative refinements reflecting policy needs (Scotland-only, Wales-only reporting) and practical constraints (ample representation across newer classes, upland coverage).
- Tables and figures document the evolving class maps and sample square distributions across CS years and country units.
