# Dataset Documentation for 'Countryside Survey mapped estimates of Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1998 and 2007'

- Scope and purpose
  - National estimates of Broad Habitat percentage increase or decrease between 1998 and 2007.
  - Estimated using the 2007 ITE Land Classification; results summarized by Land Class (ITE LC2007).
  - Methodology and mapping references include Maskell et al. 2008 and Barr 1998.
