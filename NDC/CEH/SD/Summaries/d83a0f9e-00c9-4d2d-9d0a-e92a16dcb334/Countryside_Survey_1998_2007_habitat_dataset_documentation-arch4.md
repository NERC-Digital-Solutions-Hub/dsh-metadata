# Countryside Survey mapped estimates of Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1998 and 2007

## What is this dataset?
- National estimates of the percentage change in Broad Habitat area for Great Britain between 1998 and 2007.
- Estimates are summarized by ITE Land Class 1 (17 Broad Habitat types).
- Data product: CS98_07_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp (vector shapefile).
- Each habitat’s change is provided as a percentage, across the Land Classes (LC2007) with descriptive labels (LC2007_COD). The dataset is organized by the 17 Broad Habitat types (listed as Column1 through Column17) such as Broadleaved Woodland, Coniferous Woodland, Arable and Horticulture, Grasslands, Wetlands, Water bodies, Urban, etc.

## Data contents and structure
- Fields described:
  - LC2007: ITE Land Class code (number)
  - LC2007_COD: ITE Land Class description (text)
  - SURVEY: Years of survey (text)
  - Column1 … Column17: Percent increase or decrease for each of the 17 Broad Habitat types, with specific habitat mapping (e.g., Broadleaved/Mixed/Yew Woodland; Coniferous Woodland; Boundary and Linear Features; Arable and Horticulture; etc.)
- Purpose: Provide national-scale change in habitat area over the 1998–2007 period, enabling trend analysis and comparison across habitats.

## Methodology and provenance
- Based on the 2007 ITE Land Classification (Bunce et al., 1996; 1981; 2007) and Countryside Survey methodologies.
- Mapping methodology described in Maskell et al., 2008; Barr, 1998.
- Derived from Countryside Survey field mapping and 1 km square sampling; national estimates are generated from these data.
- Supporting and methodological references available in the cited publications and the Countryside Survey project materials.

## Licensing and reuse
- Open Government Licence.
- Citations required: full dataset citation (authors, year, title, data centre DOI) on all copies/publications.
- Acknowledgement language required: Countryside Survey data owned by NERC CEH; Countryside Survey © (copyright held by CEH/NERC).

## Practical considerations for Data Leaders
- Use cases:
  - Assess data availability and coverage for habitat change at national scale.
  - Identify data gaps or granularity issues (e.g., need for higher-resolution data or more recent updates).
  - Support co-ownership and cross-team data products by aligning with user needs (policy colleagues, planners).
  - Inform data quality assessments through documented methodology and provenance.
- Data quality and standards:
  - Depends on ITE Land Classification 2007 and Countryside Survey field methods; references provide methodological context.
  - Data is provided as a shapefile with clearly defined habitat-change fields and standardized habitat categories.
- Collaboration and reuse:
  - Encouraged to cite sources and acknowledge data owners; open license facilitates sharing across networks and with stakeholders.
  - Useful for cross-network data assembly, biodiversity monitoring, and policy evaluation, with potential to coordinate alongside other Countryside Survey outputs.
