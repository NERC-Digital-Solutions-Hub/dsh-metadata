# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its use to stratify field sampling for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
  - Emphasizes that the current methodology is built on 30 years of development and remains tied to earlier approaches, enabling detection of change over time.
  - Aims to produce robust, representative national and country-level estimates of habitat and land-use features.

- Core concept: stratified sampling via the ITE Land Classification
  - Stratification divides GB into discrete land classes (initially 32, later expanded to 40, then 45 with Wales integration).
  - Use of objective, stratified random sampling to avoid bias and achieve representative coverage across ecological variation.
  - Initial central unit approach: 1 km squares (with surrounding 4 squares classified for context) to create a manageable, representative sample.

- Development history of the ITE Land Classification
  - 1978: First GB-wide stratified sampling using 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes; 1 km squares used as sampling units; eight samples per class (total 256 squares).
  - 1984: 2nd field survey; sample size increased by 50% (12 squares per class; total 384).
  - 1990: All GB squares classified (CS1990); introduced Land Cover Map linkage; 508 squares surveyed; aim to classify every square in GB with revised surrogates; results published as CS1990 main report.
  - 1998/CS2000: Land Classification extended to cover every GB square with major surrogates recalibrated; national estimates adjusted to enable separate England+Wales and Scotland reporting; increased to 40 classes; additional samples added for better country-specific estimates; uplands module added in CS2000 to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - 2007/CS2007: Wales-only reporting needs led to further refinements; Wales-specific sub-divisions added (creating new classes for country units: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 45 strata overall; additional Welsh squares (43) and adjustments to ensure Wales representation; English classes retained but with some reductions in sample in a few classes.

- Data design and sampling framework
  - Sampling units: 1 km squares across GB; center squares classified with surrounding squares to preserve spatial context.
  - Classification lineage: ITE Land Classification underpins sampling strata; updated across surveys to reflect policy needs and data realism.
  - Country-specific reporting: framework evolved to produce England+Wales and Scotland estimates; Isle of Man samples migrated to align with country reporting requirements.
  - Upland focus: CS2000 introduced an upland habitat module to strengthen estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- Data processing and national estimates
  - National estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per square within a land class with the land class’s total area.
  - Changes in land classification require careful handling to maintain cross-survey consistency; a 2006 scoping study notes that different classification choices affect GB stock estimates.
  - Documentation and transparency are emphasized for method changes, data lineage, and comparability across survey years (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).

- Country and class structure and representation
  - England, Scotland, and Wales are treated as separate country units, with sub-divided land classes to improve country-specific precision.
  - Isle of Man squares were replaced to support country-unit reporting (and to maintain representative coverage).
  - Wales required particular attention due to its dominance in Land Class 17 and to support Wales-only reporting.

- Documentation, references, and access
  - Acknowledgements, further reading, and an extensive appendix (Brief History of the ITE Land Classification) accompany the report.
  - The strategy is linked to a lineage of main reports documenting CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 results.
  - The report provides figures and tables detailing class descriptions, sampling frames, and number of squares by survey year.

- Practical implications for data stewardship
  - Maintain versioned Land Classification maps and metadata for each CS year (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007) and document any reclassifications.
  - Preserve data lineage from environmental attributes to land classes to habitat estimates; ensure reproducibility of national estimates.
  - Manage country-unit splits and class sub-divisions to support England+Wales and Scotland reporting; track changes in sampling rates and square counts per class and per country.
  - Record the upland module addition (CS2000) and its impact on habitat estimates; ensure documentation for downstream analyses and policy reporting.
  - Ensure accessibility of key outputs (maps, tables, and main reports) and maintain clear cross-references between classifications and national estimates to support longitudinal analyses.
