# Dataset Documentation for 'Countryside Survey mapped estimates of Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1998 and 2007'

- Purpose
  - Provides national estimates of Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1998 and 2007, derived using the 2007 ITE Land Classification. Summarized by Land Class 1 (ITE LC2007).
  - Supports understanding of how Broad Habitats have expanded or contracted over the period to inform policy and environmental management.

- Data product
  - CS98_07_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp (shapefile) containing national percentage change estimates for Broad Habitat types (Habitats 1–17), aggregated by Land Class.

    - LC2007_COD (text): Land Class code
    - SURVEY (text): Years of survey (from/to)
    - Column1 (number): Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland — % change

    - Column15 (number): Montane — % change
    - Column16 (number): Inland Rock — % change
    - Column17 (number): Urban — % change

- Scope and methodology
  - Estimates are national, showing percentage increase or decrease for each Broad Habitat (Habitats 1–17) between 1998 and 2007.
  - Based on the 2007 ITE Land Classification (LC2007) and linked to Land Class descriptions and mappings from Bunce et al. and related works.
  - Mapping methodology described in Maskell et al. (2008) and Countryside Survey habitat mapping methodologies (1998; 2007).
  - National estimates generated from the Countryside Survey sampling framework (1 km squares) as described in Scott (2007).

- How this data can be used (data products and applications)
  - Build dashboards or reports showing historical change in Broad Habitat areas across Great Britain.
  - Enable self-service exploration of habitat change by habitat type and land class.
  - Support policy analysis and environmental planning by quantifying shifts in woodland, grassland, wetland, urban, and other habitat types.
  - Combine with other Countryside Survey data for trend analyses, scenario planning, or visualization of regional differences.

- Notes for data use
  - Outputs are presented as percentage changes by habitat type and Land Class; users should consider the underlying spatial and temporal sampling design (1 km squares) when interpreting results.
  - Outputs may depend on the LC2007 classification alignment; ensure consistent classification in any cross-dataset analyses.
