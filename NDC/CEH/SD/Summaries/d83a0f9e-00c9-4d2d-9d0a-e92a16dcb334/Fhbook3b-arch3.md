# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Purpose and scope
- Establishes site-specific environmental health monitoring through soil, vegetation (Calluna), and freshwater sampling.
- Provides nationally distributed, spatially referenced data to enable baseline assessment, trend detection, and policy-relevant analysis.
- Describes sampling design, field procedures, data recording, sample handling, and post-survey workflows to ensure comparability and data integrity.

## Sampling types and aims
- Soil sampling: national baseline dataset on soil chemistry, soil fauna diversity, and soil microbiological status from the same 1 km squares used in earlier surveys.
- Calluna sampling: collect foliar nitrogen (CYG shoots) to identify regions with nitrogen deposition exceeding critical loads for Calluna vulgaris, enabling deposition-response analyses.
- Freshwater sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff in coordination with CS2000 field work, to align freshwater biota data with terrestrial monitoring.

## Soil sampling protocol
- Five replicate soil samples per X-plot in each square (centered within plots), collected for soil chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals) and soil fauna diversity/microbiological status.
- Sampling location: centre plot of each X-plot, 15 cm north of the north corner; additional samples at 15 cm east and west for a total of five locations per square.
- Sample handling: three cores per center plot using designated black and white pipes; samples posted to ITE Merlewood in labeled envelopes; rapid processing for short-lived analyses when applicable.
- Documentation: fill labels clearly, include location notes for any deviations (roots, obstacles), and maintain chain-of-custody via pre-labeled packaging.

## Calluna sampling protocol
- Within squares containing Calluna vulgaris, collect current year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants, ensuring random sampling across the area.
- Packaging and drying: seal in provided bags, allow air circulation if samples are wet, and despatch to ITE Merlewood with receipt for postage.
- Rationale: supports establishment of nitrogen deposition indicators through foliar chemistry in GB.

## Freshwater sampling protocol
- Managed by IFE staff in collaboration with CS2000 coordinators; sampling occurs concurrently with terrestrial survey in selected squares.
- Aims to integrate aquatic biota data with land-based monitoring for comprehensive environmental health assessment.

## Equipment, packaging, and logistics
- Equipment and consumables are allocated to regional teams; required items include cool boxes, trowels, probes, pipes (black and white), aluminum plates, and sealable bags.
- Packaging specifics: envelopes and bags are pre-labeled with square and plot identifiers; pipes are color-coded (black for soil core, white for shorter soil cores); materials organized to fit postal constraints.
- Documentation: team members complete detailed notes on sampling locations and any anomalies; envelopes and bags are mailed to ITE Merlewood with proper traceability.

## Data recording, sampling workflow, and data management
- Field data sheets (FABs) accompany samples; each plot/feature is carefully labeled and logged with plot IDs and parcel information.
- Recording procedures emphasize accuracy, consistency, and traceability (center plot coordinates, sampling depths, and any deviations).
- Post-survey workflow emphasizes timely return of FABs and samples to ITE/field stations; data verification and minimal re-entry to preserve time-series integrity.

## GPS data collection and Annex 1 guidance
- GPS data collection is standardized to ensure accurate georeferencing of plots and features.
- Key steps include: verifying satellite availability (minimum four satellites; aim for PDOP below 6), recording stationary vs moving positions, and creating plot-specific data files named with square/plot identifiers (e.g., 501X4.PSE).
- Logging controls: start/stop logging, monitor elapsed time, and ensure proper shutdown and battery management; keep GPS almanac up-to-date automatically when possible.

## Photography and documentation
- One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to capture general appearance and landmark references.
- Include square and plot identifiers on a reference board visible in each photo; aim for clear, well-composed shots with key features in view and limited sky exposure.

## Procedures after survey
- Conduct a rigorous review of data sheets to ensure no omissions.
- Avoid post-hoc transcription unless essential (only if maps or forms are damaged); organize transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

## Supporting context and governance
- The handbook supports standardized methods for long-term environmental monitoring across GB, with attention to data quality, comparability across years and sites, and clear procedures for data handling and sample management.
- It provides the operational backbone for integrating field data into time-series analyses and policy-relevant indicators.
