# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Standardizes current ecological data collection across Great Britain to monitor land cover, habitat change, and biodiversity indicators; supports policy, biodiversity action plans, and time-series analyses.
  - Aims to link field data with remote sensing and produce structured data products for policy, planning, and conservation.

- Sampling framework and planning
  - Core sample of 508 squares; CS2000 expands to 568 squares with country-specific adjustments, new and replacement squares.
  - Six field teams; ~95 squares per team; typical field time of about four days per square; upland squares added to strengthen representation.
  - Planning emphasizes alignment with prior surveys, neighbor-based surveying for new squares, and consistent sequencing for old squares.

- Planning site visits and logistics
  - Guidance on team flexibility, travel planning, and minimizing site revisits; no overtime pay (time-off-in-lieu considerations).
  - Scheduling aims for consistency with previous surveys and efficient resource use.

- Equipment and field gear
  - Clear provisioning and safety guidance; essential tools include FABs, GPS, maps, aerial photos, compasses, plotting gear, survey markers, and cameras.
  - Emphasis on careful handling and loss prevention.

- General field survey procedures
  - Old squares focus on changes since 1990; new squares inventory stock within the square.
  - Rapid condition assessment, permissions, route planning, and post-survey review to ensure completeness.

- Permissions and access
  - Landowner consent required for all surveys; proactive communication and goodwill maintenance.
  - If access is denied, predefined steps determine relocation, partial surveying, or abandonment of parts.
  - Landowner details recorded to facilitate future surveys.

- Data recording and mapping structures
  - CS1990/CS2000 data framework comprises mapping, plots/vegetation recording, and sampling.
  - Time-series mapping: focus on change in old squares; de novo mapping in new squares; integration with prior maps.
  - Outputs align with broad habitat frameworks for Biodiversity Action Plans (BAP) and include specific plot-level data in upland vs. lowland contexts.

- Mapping techniques and codes
  - Detailed field coding system for features (areas, lines, points) describing land cover, vegetation, boundaries, buildings, and infrastructure; mix of alpha-numeric codes; guidance on unique codes and multi-code descriptions.
  - Aerial photography conventions guide usage when ground truth supersedes historic API signals.
  - Boundary and boundary-condition coding and representation on maps.

- Ponds, broad habitats, and plots
  - Annexed notes on pond mapping and interpretation within CS2000 contexts.
  - Distinction between Mappable Broad Habitats (for change detection) and Plottable Broad Habitats (finer-scale plotting in unenclosed landscapes).
  - Procedures for translating 1990 CS codes to current BAP maps and annotating changes.

- Plot types and vegetation recording (core data products)
  - X PLOTS (Large, 200 m2): core vegetation plots with nested subplots.
  - Y PLOTS (Small, 4 m2): baseline vegetation plots for monitoring changes.
  - U PLOTS (Unenclosed, 4 m2): added to sample unenclosed habitats.
  - B PLOTS (Boundary, 200 m2): boundary vegetation monitoring.
  - A PLOTS (Arable margins, 100 x 1 m): arable weed communities at field edges.
  - H PLOTS (Hedgerow, 10 x 1 m): hedgerow vegetation plots.
  - D PLOTS (Hedgerow diversity, 30 m): woody species diversity within hedgerows.
  - S & W PLOTS (Streamside/W agents, 10 x 1 m): vegetation along watercourses.
  - R & V PLOTS (Roadside and Verge): roadside/verge vegetation.
  - Data capture uses standardized forms; species presence and 5% cover bands; nested plotting records which subplot observed in; bryophytes and lichens tracked with predefined lists.

- Vegetation recording methods
  - Standard recording sheets with top 200 species, unlisted species, and plot geometry sketches.
  - Edge effects and relocation rules for plots in crops; 5% cover bands; dedicated rules for trees/overhanging vegetation.
  - Aggregation rules for uncertain identifications; predefined bryophyte/lichen lists with cover values.

- Data quality, training, and change management
  - Emphasis on standardization and quality control to ensure time-series comparability; field judgment and consistent coding are critical.
  - Annex covers GPS data collection to improve plot relocation and long-term data integrity.

- Outputs, documentation, and annexes
  - Outputs include OS base maps (1:10,000), thematic maps (Physiography, Agriculture/NATVEG, Forestry/WOODLANDS, Boundaries, Buildings/Coast/Recreation), BAP maps, FABs, and historical CS1990 sheets.
  - Annexes cover pond data, GPS data collection, and plotting/dot-grid overlays.
  - Provides guidelines for unique vs. standard codes and parcel renumbering.

- Endnotes and context
  - CS2000 aims to deliver current, comparable national datasets to support policy, biodiversity action plans, and sustainable development indicators.
  - Advocates a two-tier approach, balancing ground-truth field data with remote sensing/land cover mapping for robust change detection.

- Section 10 – Sampling (highlights)
  - Three sampling types: soil, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling (the latter managed by IFE).
  - Soil sampling: five replicate samples per square; three cores per X-plot; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing; standardized field procedures and packaging.
  - Calluna sampling: within squares with Calluna vulgaris, harvest current year’s growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g) for nitrogen- deposition analyses; careful drying/packing and dispatch to ITE Merlewood.
  - Freshwater sampling: coordinated with IFE staff; timing arrangements with coordinators.

- Section 11 – Photography
  - One camera per team; photographs of every plot with reference features that are obvious, permanent, and visible across visits.
  - Photos labeled with square/plot numbers; composition guidelines to include plot and reference features; avoid excessive sky.

- Section 12 – Procedures after survey
  - Post-survey data checks to ensure no omissions; limited data transposition only if essential; arrange quick transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations.

- Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data
  - Step-by-step instructions for GPS power, satellites, stationary vs moving logging, file naming (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501 plot X4), sampling rate, and feature recording.
  - Emphasizes maintaining data quality with PDOP targets (<6 for good 3D fixes), dealing with obstructions, battery management, and almanac updates.
  - Provides an attribute reference sheet to quickly select plot IDs and features.
