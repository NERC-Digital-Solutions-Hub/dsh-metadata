# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Purpose and scope
- Updates and extends CS1990 methodologies for collecting, recording, and analyzing data on land use, land cover, and vegetation across Great Britain.
- Aims to produce current time-series datasets to monitor changes, support ecological classification, and inform policy objectives.
- Emphasizes standardization, quality control, and the integration of field data with remote sensing; enables both policy indicators and ecological research.

## Sampling types and design
- Three main sampling types:
  - Soil sampling (Section 10.7 onward): five replicate soil samples per 1 km square X-plot, analyzed for chemistry, fauna, and microbiology; processed at ITE Merlewood.
  - Calluna sampling (Section 10.8–10.11): foliar nitrogen sampling to assess deposition risks; random selection of current-year growth within sampled areas; samples despatched to ITE Merlewood.
  - Freshwater biota sampling (Section 10.11 onward): conducted by IFE staff concurrently with CS2000 fieldwork; coordination with CS2000 coordinators.
- Background rationale links soil quality to broader environmental assessments and critical loads for Calluna vulgaris.

## Equipment and field logistics
- Comprehensive equipment kit includes FABs (Field Assessment Booklets), GPS, maps, safety gear, cameras, marking plates, and more.
- Some items are distributed to teams in a structured manner (marked with * or # in the handbook); standard CS2000 equipment accompanies the kit.
- Emphasis on traceability, gear handling, and minimizing delays through effective coordination with landowners and occupiers.

## Field procedures and data collection
- Soil sampling procedures (center plot approach in each X-plot):
  - Identify center plot corner, mark points 15 cm north and two additional 15 cm offsets (east and west).
  - Use long black pipe for the first core; two white short pipes for subsequent cores; package, label, and post promptly to ITE Merlewood.
  - Record any notable site conditions, and transport samples with appropriate containment.
- Calluna sampling protocol:
  - Within every square containing Calluna vulgaris, collect 30–50 g of current-year growth; seal and despatch promptly to ITE Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Coordinated timing with IFE staff to avoid conflicts; monitor scheduling and field log.

## Data recording, mapping, and plot framework
- Data organized around three core elements: mapping, vegetation plots, and sampling.
- Plot types (examples):
  - X plots: core 2 m x 2 m plots for soil sampling centers.
  - Y plots, U plots, B plots, A plots, H and D plots: varied vegetation sampling grids and boundary/edge sampling to capture habitat heterogeneity.
  - S/W/R/V plots: streamline riparian, road verge, and habitat-adjacent sampling.
- Relocation and data integrity:
  - Permanent markers and field plates ensure plot relocation across survey years.
  - Data capture aligned with broad habitat categories and plot-level details for robust time-series analyses.
- Documentation and reporting:
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) standardize data entry, coding, and reporting; strict page completion and coding order to ensure data quality.

## Photography and imagery
- One camera per team; initial film stock provided; additional films claimed via T&S.
- Photos should document every vegetation plot, with reference features that are obvious, permanent, and visible in future visits.
- Each image must include square/plot identifiers on a label board; composition aims to show the plot and reference features clearly.

## Procedures after survey
- Daily data review to ensure no features are omitted.
- Transcription to fresh maps is discouraged but allowable if necessary due to damage; otherwise data should remain on original forms.
- Arrangements for returning FABs and samples to ITE stations should be made promptly.

## GPS data collection and management (Annex 1)
- Step-by-step guidance for battery checks, satellite availability (minimum four satellites; PDOP ideally below 6), stationary vs moving log modes, and file naming.
- Custom file-naming scheme: each plot/feature gets a unique file name combining square number and plot/feature ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE; 501F1.MOB for a new feature).
- Recording pace and data logging:
  - Set sampling rate to 1 second; start/stop logs carefully; monitor time stamps and data consistency.
- Handling obstructions and hardware tips:
  - If obstructed, elevate the antenna; ensure clear sky view for accurate readings.
- Attribute reference and shorthand:
  - Use the attribute reference sheet to quickly select plot identifiers; enables rapid, accurate GPS tagging.

## Annexes and supplementary content
- Detailed GPS data collection procedures, including almanac management (automatic updates) and troubleshooting PDOP.
- Guidance on GPS data file management, categories of features, and reference coding schemes to support consistent metadata across survey years.

Note: The document also includes extensive, specific lists and coding schemes for mosses/lichens and vascular plants, as well as comprehensive instructions for GPS data handling and FAB management, all designed to ensure rigorous, repeatable, and nationally comparable field data collection.
