# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Overview
  - A QA study of CS2000 fieldwork to assess consistency and reliability across the major field components, acknowledging variation due to many recorders, despite training and supervision.
  - Sampled 38 of 519 squares; one quarter of each selected square resurveyed, recording 234 plots across nine plot types.

- Aims
  - Quantify field-recording accuracy and change statistics.
  - Examine plot relocation efficiency (plates and plots).
  - Explain differences via observer error, plot location/orientation, plot type, management, and season.
  - Relate CS2000 findings to CS1990 performance.

- Methods and scope
  - QA involved relocation tests, species concordance checks, and assessments of vegetation cover, landuse mapping, and boundary features.
  - Plots and plates were relocated using original maps, photographs, and detectors; detailed annexes specify protocols.
  - Data types analyzed: species lists, cover estimates, landcover codes, boundary features, and observed changes since 1990.

- Key findings

  - Plot relocation and plate recovery
    - 86.7% of 210 plots were satisfactorily relocated; ~60% relocation exact, ~25% approximate, ~15% not adequately relocated.
    - Plate recovery by CS2000 surveyors was 60% exact; assessors achieved ~69.3% recovery; total approximate recovery around 40–45%.
    - Eight-year relocation proved feasible but with more challenges than the 1991 QA of CS1990 (87.1%).
    - Small habitat plots (Y-plots) were the most difficult to relocate.

  - Species concordance and recording accuracy
    - About 6000 records across 210 plots; 71% of records confirmed by assessors; 2% non-concordances due to real management/seasonal changes.
    - Overall initial recording accuracy estimated at ~73%, with most discrepancies tied to plot location/orientation and sampling differences.
    - CS2000 vs QA showed that QA often produced longer species lists; same assessor pool used in 1991 and 1998 QA, implying similar survey efficiency.

  - Vegetation cover estimates
    - For the 30 most frequent species with appreciable cover, several grasses showed significant differences between CS2000 and QA (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum), likely influenced by season and identification.
    - Overall, cover agreements were reasonable across many species; some notable mismatches existed, but many high-cover grasses showed consistent results.

  - Change direction and ordination (DECORANA)
    - Direction of vegetation change between original survey and assessment was generally unbiased; DECORANA axis shifts were not directionally biased when analyzed by plot type and landclass.
    - Mean axis scores CS2000 vs QA were not significantly different, indicating no systematic bias.

  - Landcover mapping and code concordance
    - Landcover codes grouped into primary, secondary, and cover codes; high agreement overall.
    - Primary landcover codes: ~88% concordance; BAP codes ~77%; primary boundary codes ~85%; overall primary landcover agreement ~87.5%.
    - Hedge-related mapping (H plots) showed some under-recording and a notable portion of changes not captured.

  - Recording of change (since 1990)
    - 177 change instances analyzed; 16.4% reflect observer errors or omissions in 1990 codes.
    - Overall change concurrence: 51.4%; change not noted by CS2000: 33.9%; change recorded but not substantiated by assessors: 14.7%.
    - Substantial portion of real changes since 1990 may have been missed; plot data deemed more reliable for evaluating change than CS2000 strings alone.

  - Hedge diversity and arable plots
    - Hedge diversity: 124 total species recorded; 92 common; overall concordance 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%; mean species per hedge plot 5.16 (CS2000) vs 5.89 (QA).
    - Arable plots: only five plots; concordance was very poor, likely due to seasonal effects and lower familiarity with ruderal species; recommendation for two visits per plot in future arable margins.

  - Boundary features and codes
    - Boundary height and stockproofness codes showed high concordance (around 83–92% depending on measure); occasional misclassification of hedge shapes and wall conditions noted.
    - Some inconsistencies attributed to differences in interpretation of hedge/wall codes and the application of new codes.

- Overall assessment and implications
  - CS2000 fieldwork demonstrated substantial reliability comparable to the CS1990 QA benchmarks, with robust performance in plot relocation, species recording, and landcover coding.
  - Primary data strengths: plot relocation feasibility across eight years, strong code concordance for primary landcover and boundaries, and generally good cover agreement for many common species.
  - Limitations and improvement areas: location/orientation errors as major sources of mis-match; under-recording or over-recording of certain grasses and common species; incomplete detection of change since 1990; limited arable margin data due to small sample.
  - Mapping and change detection are generally reliable, but change detection in particular requires cautious interpretation; outputs should leverage plot data for robust long-term change assessment.
  - Recommendations for future work: enhance plot location accuracy, consider more repeated visits for arable margins, and refine boundary/hedge coding practices to reduce misclassification; ensure more effective communication of changes back to data users to promote reuse and understanding.
