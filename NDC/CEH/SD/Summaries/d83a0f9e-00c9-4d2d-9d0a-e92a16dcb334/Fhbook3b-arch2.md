# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose
  - National field surveys to monitor land use, landscape features, vegetation, and ecological change over time.
  - Builds on CS1990; CS2000 introduces structured, repeatable time-series data for policy, biodiversity actions, and sustainable development indicators.
  - Emphasizes standardised field recording, data quality control, and linking ground data with remote sensing to enhance pattern detection.

- Aims for analysts
  - Produce consistent, comparable datasets across years to assess environmental health and policy performance.
  - Deliver data in formats suitable for government, NGOs, and researchers; enable time-series analysis and trend detection.
  - Link field data with satellite imagery and generate land cover maps for ground-truthing and broader projection.

- Sampling framework and survey design
  - CS1990 core sample of 508 1-km squares; CS2000 revisits these and expands sampling.
  - Six ITE research stations; each team surveys ~95 squares; planning targets of four field-days per square.
  - Refinements: subdividing Land Classes by country variants, adding squares for new classes, replacements where coverage is lacking, and a new uplands module adding 30 squares.
  - Target GB sample of 568 squares (new/replacement included); re-survey old squares to preserve time-series.
  - Emphasis on consistent, standardised observer procedures to improve statistical accuracy.

- Planning, logistics and data integrity
  - Flexible planning; minimize unnecessary revisits; permissions secured before fieldwork.
  - Seasonal consistency: re-survey old squares in the same order as 1990; schedule new squares near neighbours when possible.
  - Quality control as a core objective to reduce recording variability and maintain reliability.

- Equipment and field operations
  - Comprehensive equipment, safety provisions, and site-appropriate gear.
  - Field Assessment Books (FABs) as primary data collection tool; accuracy and organisation critical for later analysis.
  - GPS, maps, aerial photographs, and calibrated measurement tools standard.
  - Clear guidelines on permissions, ownership, and access logistics.

- Permissions and access
  - Access to all parts of a square requires landowner or agent consent.
  - Early notification letters accompany on-site verification; follow-ups may occur.
  - If access is refused for all/part of a square, fieldwork may be adjusted or abandoned with replacements to maintain random sampling integrity.
  - Documentation of land ownership and updates if ownership or tenancy changes.

- Data recording: FAB structure and mapping
  - Three primary mapping objectives:
    - Map changes (using CS1990 baseline) and report by broad habitat categories.
    - Report results by broad habitats for Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) with robust estimates.
    - Plottable vs. Mappable Broad Habitats to accommodate upland vs. lowland mapping constraints.
  - New mapping approach:
    - In new squares, detailed coding of features (area, line, point) with alpha-numeric codes to save space.
    - In old squares, use CS1990 codes as baseline, identify changes, and create new parcel entries or lines for significant changes; maintain traceability to original features.
    - BAP maps translate CS1990 codes to broad habitat categories; link field changes to BAP classification.
  - Ponds are recorded and tracked with attention to changes from the 1996 Lowland Pond Survey definitions.

- Broad habitat framework and upland vs. lowland
  - Mappable Broad Habitats (Mappable BAPs): discrete, mappable habitats (e.g., woodland, boundaries, arable lands, improved grassland) for 1998 mapping.
  - Plottable Broad Habitats (Plottable BAPs): habitats that are diffuse/gradient-based (e.g., montane, supra-littoral, dune/slack mosaics); monitored via plot data and broader habitat mapping.
  - Time-saving mapping in Plottable BAPs to allow more plots and baseline data for future monitoring.

- Plot types and vegetation sampling
  - X PLOTS – LARGE (200 m2)
    - Primary vegetation mapping with nested subplots (4 m2 inner plot, etc.); permanent markers; detailed relocation methods; serial species monitoring.
  - Y PLOTS – SMALL (4 m2 total)
    - Five plots per square in new squares; across diverse land covers to sample semi-natural vegetation changes.
  - U PLOTS – UNENCLOSED (2 x 2 m)
    - Introduced in 1998 for unenclosed habitats; up to 10 plots per square depending on Plottable Broad Habitats.
  - B PLOTS – BOUNDARY (200 m2)
    - Vegetation at field boundaries (hedges, walls, fences); prioritised if multiple elements exist.
  - A PLOTS – ARABLE FIELD MARGIN (100 x 1 m)
    - Monitor arable weed communities at field margins near boundaries.
  - H PLOTS – HEDGEROW (10 x 1 m)
    - Two plots per square where hedges exist; relocated as needed in old squares.
  - D PLOTS – HEDGEROW DIVERSITY (30 m hedgerows)
    - Baseline woody species diversity; all woody species recorded; extended to 30 m with additional endpoints.
  - S & W PLOTS – STREAMSIDE (10 x 1 m)
    - Along streams/rivers/ditches; include water-edge and buffer vegetation; relocation and annual updates aligned with other plots.
  - R & V PLOTS – ROADSIDE & VERGE (10 x 1 m)
    - Vegetation along transport routes; verge types categorized; road type considerations; relocation/verification procedures described.
  - General rules
    - Standard recording sheets; top 200 species plus space for unlisted species; 5% cover steps; nested plots and mosaics documented.
    - Permanent markers and GPS enable repeatability and relocation accuracy.
    - Special provisions for cropped plots and old vs new squares.

- Vegetation recording and species data
  - Standardised 200-species list for common herbs, grasses, and bryophytes; unlisted species recorded with Latin names where possible.
  - Allowable species combinations manage identification uncertainty; combinations listed.
  - Bryophytes and lichens from predefined lists with specific cover values.
  - Plot-level data includes nested plots with Q and S columns to indicate presence/cover; 5% cover steps.
  - Consistency with prior CS surveys; note on complex mosaics and aggregation rules.

- Data quality, reporting, and change interpretation
  - Emphasis on consistent, comparable data across years; standardisation reduces observer bias.
  - Change interpretation relies on field-based judgment; multiple illustrations for change allowed; ensure logical links between maps and data entries.
  - Pooled outputs: broad habitat summaries, plot-level vegetation changes, and boundary/mosaic changes aligned with BAP categories.

- Annexes and tools
  - Annex 1: Collecting GPS data—equipment and procedures for precise relocation and mapping.
  - Guidance on field coding, boundary types, and coding conventions.
  - Guidance for aerial photograph interpretation (API) with caveats about relying on API without ground-truthing.

- Enduring themes for analysts
  - A robust, standardised framework for monitoring environmental change over time using repeated, comparable field data.
  - A dual mapping strategy combining high-resolution plot data with broader habitat categories to support policy and biodiversity indicators.
  - A data-centric approach emphasizing reproducibility, traceability (parcel numbers, codes, BAP translations), and accessible underlying data for users beyond field collectors.

- Section 10 – Sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater)
  - Soil sampling: five replicate samples per 1-km square (from the same squares used in 1978) to assess soil chemistry, soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status; samples sent to ITE Merlewood.
  - Sampling design: three cores per X-plot; standardized collection and packaging; rapid processing for some samples; detailed field procedures documented.
  - Calluna sampling: assess foliar nitrogen in Calluna vulgaris to infer nitrogen deposition; standardized collection from current year growth; samples mailed to ITE Merlewood.
  - Freshwater sampling: IFE-accredited staff may sample in squares concurrently with CS2000 teams.
  - Equipment/distribution: specific packaging and shipping protocols; field teams receive and use designated items; detailed envelope/pipe logistics.

- Section 11 – Photography
  - One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks.
  - Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and visible; photos include square/plot identifiers on a marker board; composition guidelines to optimize informative content.

- Section 12 – Procedures after survey
  - Review data sheets daily to ensure no features are omitted; transcription to fresh maps only if data damage requires it.
  - Transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

- Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data
  - Step-by-step GPS usage: battery/power checks, stationary vs moving position logging, file naming conventions, sampling rate settings, and plot naming.
  - Guidance on achieving good PDOP (<6), dealing with obstructions, and using the Magellan keypad.
  - Recording stationary positions requires clear unobstructed sky views for 3–5 minutes; file naming encodes square and plot IDs for traceability.
