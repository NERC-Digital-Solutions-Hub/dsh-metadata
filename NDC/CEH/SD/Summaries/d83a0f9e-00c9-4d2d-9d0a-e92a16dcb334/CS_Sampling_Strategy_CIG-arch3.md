# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Establishes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
  - Builds on a 30-year time series designed to support environmental policy, monitoring change, and decision-making.
  - Emphasizes representativeness through stratified, random sampling and a robust environmental land classification.

- Core concepts: stratified sampling and land classification
  - Uses stratification to ensure samples represent different land types and ecological conditions.
  - ITE Land Classification (LC) provides discrete land classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
  - Early versions used 32 LC classes; later updates expanded to 40 and then 45 classes to improve country- and Wales-specific reporting.
  - Sampling units are 1 km squares (field survey units); a centre square plus surrounding squares are included for classification.

- Estimation approach
  - National habitat estimates are derived by combining:
    - The proportion of the GB land area accounted for each LC class.
    - The mean habitat area per square within each class.
  - This enables national, regional, and country-specific estimates (England, Scotland, Wales), facilitating policy-relevant reporting.

- Chronology of CS surveys and LC developments
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey)
    - ISA-based classification into 32 LC classes from environmental data for 1 km squares.
    - 8 squares per class sampled (total 256) across GB; focus on vegetation quadrats and soils.
  - CS1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - 12 squares per LC class (384 total); expanded survey scope to land use and habitat mapping.
  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
    - LC revised to classify every 1 km square in GB; urban and sea corrections applied.
    - 508 squares surveyed; added Land Cover Map linkage; preserved data from 1984 survey.
  - CS2000 (Revised LC & 4th Field Survey)
    - LC expanded to enable Scotland-only reporting; 40 LC classes.
    - Implemented separate country estimates by subdividing LC classes into country-specific versions; added 19 extra squares to ensure representation; 4 additional squares allocated in some classes to maintain precision.
    - Included a Wales-focused upland habitat module (see below).
  - CS2007 (Revised LC with Wales reporting; 5th Field Survey)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further LC subdivisions (five new Wales-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an expanded total of 45 strata.
    - Added 43 Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation (6 per Welsh class); England squares adjusted accordingly.
    - Maintained England, Scotland, and Wales as distinct country units for reporting; refined sampling to support Wales-only results.

- Country reporting and upland emphasis
  - England with Wales and Scotland reporting adjustments introduced to support country-specific environmental policy requirements.
  - Isle of Man squares replaced when necessary to maintain country-specific representativeness.
  - Upland habitat module added to CS2000 (30 squares) to improve accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Data handling, governance, and comparability
  - Emphasis on using LC-based strata to generate national estimates consistently across surveys.
  - Acknowledges that changing LC classifications can affect comparability; notes that using the latest LC for GB estimates improves internal consistency, while older classifications aid cross-survey comparability.
  - Outputs include detailed tabulations of squares by class and country, enabling transparent, policy-relevant reporting.

- Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates how to build a long-term environmental monitoring framework that:
    - Uses a living classification system to reflect policy needs (country-specific reporting).
    - Ensures representativeness through stratified, random sampling across time.
    - Connects field data to national-scale habitat and land-use estimates.
  - Highlights challenges for monitoring programs: maintaining data quality, addressing metadata gaps, ensuring data sharing, and managing evolving governance requirements across countries.
