# Environmental Change Network Terrestrial Site Locations

- Global context: Recognition of large-scale environmental changes driven by human activities (climate, atmospheric composition, land use) and the need for reliable, long-term UK monitoring to inform policy and research.
- UK monitoring landscape: Decentralised, sectoral, with growing moves toward harmonisation and data integration; links to international programs (IMP, UNEP-GEMS, GRID).

## Aim

- Provide uniform, comparable long-term datasets at selected UK sites.
- Enable integration and analysis of datasets to identify environmental changes and their causes.
- Make long-term datasets available for research and future change prediction.
- Establish representative sites with good instrumentation and reliable information for research purposes.

## ECN Objectives

- Obtain uniform, comparable long-term datasets via regular measurements of core environmental variables.
- Integrate and analyze datasets to understand changes and their drivers.
- Provide datasets as a basis for research and forecasting of future changes.
- Maintain representative sites with high-quality instrumentation and reliable information.

## ECN Design and Protocols

- Focus: Long-term ecological monitoring that includes both biota and physical/chemical environment.
- Core vs priority measurements: Core measurements undertaken at all sites; priority, non-core measurements only if funds permit.
- Data handling: Agreed protocols for sampling, measurement, chemical analysis, quality control, data storage and management.
- Statistical design: Considerations include spatial location of sites, replication, and balancing simplicity with robustness; careful guidance on analysis (avoid over-reliance on data dredging; use simple routines for routine analysis; cross-validation for complex models).
- Data practices: Emphasise standardisation and compatibility to allow cross-site and cross-network analyses.

## Development and Governance

- Stepwise implementation: Terrestrial network established first, freshwater network to follow.
- Sponsoring agencies contribute sites and resources; data coordination through national bodies.
- Structural bodies:
  - ECN Steering Committee: high-level policy decisions.
  - ECN Executive Committee (ECNEX): expedite urgent decisions.
  - STAG (Statistics and Technical Advisory Group): merged advisory function for statistics and technical guidance.
  - Central Coordination Unit (CCU): NERC-managed, four full-time staff, standardisation and data coordination.
  - Site Managers: sponsor-provided at each site, responsible for data collection and transmission.
- Day-to-day management: CCU coordinates standard procedures and data workflows; data managers compile and format data for central storage.

## Site Selection

- Initial pool: 140 candidate sites refined to 24 terrestrial targets.
- Selection criteria:
  - Wide geographical distribution across major UK ecosystems.
  - Potential for long-term physical/financial security.
  - History of consistent management and accessible records (preferably 10+ years of data).
  - Sufficient size and replication opportunities.
- Network structure: A “spine” of representative terrestrial sites (started with eight in 1992, expanding to 11 by 1996) intended to be extended over time and supplemented by replication along UK environmental gradients.
- Terrestrial sites listed (with sponsors and general focus) include:
  - Alice Holt Forest (Surrey): long-term forest monitoring; EU atmospheric deposition site; Rothamsted light trap; forest research programs.
  - Drayton (Warwickshire): mixed farming; pesticide, nitrogen, runoff studies; weed/disease control; long-term agricultural experiments.
  - Glensaugh (Grampian, Scotland): upland grazing systems; long research history; biodiversity and nutrient/pollutant dynamics.
  - Hillsborough (Northern Ireland): grassland and forest resources; extensive meteorological data; slug and earthworm concerns; multiple research themes.
  - Moor House – Upper Teesdale (Cumbria/Durham): UNESCO Biosphere; upland arctic/alpine communities; TIGER program; multiple research locations and altitudinal gradient experiments.
  - North Wyke (Devon): grassland and nutrient cycling; nitrogen flux to water and air; low-input farming experiments; TSS grazing study.
  - Porton Down (Wiltshire): chalk grassland with high biodiversity; sssi; unique downland habitat and juniper stands; long-term ecological status.
  - Rothamsted (Hertfordshire): historic long-term experiments (Broadbalk, Park Grass); insect monitoring network; extensive archived data.
  - Sourhope (Borders): rough grazing and sheep/goat systems; long meteorological data; vegetation and soil fertility experiments.
  - Wytham (Oxfordshire): Oxford University site; long-term woodland/grassland experiments; TIGER; diverse fauna and flora studies.
  - Y Wyddfa/Snowdon (Gwynedd): high-altitude alpine/montane conditions; calcicolous grasslands; grazing and invertebrate research; arctic/alpine biodiversity.

- Freshwater network: Complementary network of lake and river sites began in 1995 (38 sites noted), with terrestrial and freshwater networks designed to provide integrated environmental monitoring.

## Terrestrial Sites: Highlights of Key Features

- Long-term data trails: Many sites maintain extensive meteorological records, historical datasets, and long-running ecological experiments (e.g., Rothamsted, Moor House, North Wyke).
- Diverse ecosystems: Ranging from lowland forests and farms to upland moors, peatlands, and high-elevation calcareous grasslands.
- Research themes: Climate change responses, nutrient and pollutant deposition, land-use change, grazing management, biodiversity, soil chemistry, hydrology, and connections between terrestrial and aquatic systems.
- Collaboration and integration: Data and protocols aligned with sectoral monitoring schemes to add value and enable regional/national analyses.

## Network Operation and Data Management

- Coordination: Steering Committee sets policy; ECNEX handles urgent decisions; STAG provides integrated technical and statistical guidance.
- Central management: CCU coordinates standard procedures, data collection, and data transfer; a dedicated data manager handles consolidation and formatting.
- Site-level operations: Each site has a Sponsor and a Site Manager responsible for timely data collection, processing, and transmission to the central Data Manager.
- Data use and access: Designed to ensure the data are usable for researchers and for evaluating policy performance, with an emphasis on data quality, standardisation, and cross-site comparability.

## Key Points for Analysts Monitoring the Environment

- ECN’s core purpose is to enable consistent, long-term environmental monitoring across the UK through standardized datasets, protocols, and governance.
- The network emphasizes core measurements with potential for additional variables as funding allows, enabling broad comparisons across sites and integration with sectoral and international data programs.
- A robust organizational framework supports data quality, standardisation, and accessibility, while addressing challenges of multi-organization governance and long-term funding.
- The terrestrial spine of 11 sites (1992–1996 expansion) provides geographically representative coverage and a platform for long-term ecological research and policy evaluation, complemented by a freshwater network to capture integrated environmental change.
