# Environmental Change Network Terrestrial Site Locations

## Overview
- The document outlines the UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) and its rationale for long-term, integrated environmental monitoring.
- ECN aims to detect broad environmental changes through uniform, comparable datasets across multiple terrestrial and freshwater sites.
- Outputs include data integrations, analysis to identify changes, and accessible datasets for research and policy.

## Aims and Objectives of ECN
- Obtain uniform and comparable long-term datasets at selected sites via regular measurements of key environmental variables.
- Integrate and analyze these datasets to identify environmental changes and understand their causes.
- Make long-term datasets available for research and future-change predictions.
- Provide representative sites with good instrumentation and reliable information for research purposes.

## ECN Design and Protocols
- Monitoring scope includes both biota and physical/chemical environmental variables (ecological monitoring).
- Core measurements (common across all sites) plus priority additional measurements (desirable if funds allow).
- Variables are chosen to be interpretable, comparable, repeatable, and affordable; designed to apply across sites with diverse conditions.
- Establishment of strict protocols for sampling, recording, chemical analysis, quality control, and data management.
- Data handling is planned via a central system, with sectoral networks adopted where possible to enhance value and context (e.g., butterfly monitoring, insect surveys, bird censuses, precipitation networks).
- Statistical design guided by a dedicated working group; emphasis on replication, data quality, and avoiding early overfitting or data dredging.

## Development and Network Establishment
- ECN adopted a step-by-step approach, starting with terrestrial sites and planning linked freshwater networks later.
- Initial network: terrestrial sites with commitments from contributing agencies; later expanded to increase geographical coverage.
- Target list began with 24 sites; selection balanced representativeness with long-term physical and financial security.
- Terrestrial spine established in 1992 (8 sites) and expanded to 11 sites by 1996, with plans to extend and replicate along major UK environmental axes.
- Current/notable terrestrial sites: a core set with plans to broaden geographic and ecological coverage.

## Site Selection Criteria
- Good geographical distribution across major UK ecosystems.
- Long-term physical and financial security and reliable management history.
- Past data records (preferably 10+ years) to enable trend analysis.
- Sufficient site size and opportunity for replication and continued observation.

## Terrestrial Network Sites (as of 1996)
- Alice Holt Forest, Surrey, England — Forestry Commission: forest ecosystem with long-term meteorological records and ECN-related monitoring.
- Drayton, Warwickshire, England — MAFF/ADAS: mixed farming site with extensive pesticide, soil, and environmental management studies.
- Glensaugh, Grampian, Scotland — Macaulay Land Use Research Institute: upland/mixed vegetation, long-term data resources.
- Hillsborough, Co Down, Northern Ireland — DA/Northern Ireland; grass and beef/dairy focus with long meteorological records and a SSSI site.
- Moor House – Upper Teesdale, Cumbria/Durham, England — NERC and English Nature: upland reserve with long-term vegetation and nutrient studies and TIGER-related experiments.
- North Wyke, Devon, England — BBSRC: grassland and nutrient cycling focus with detailed nitrogen and greenhouse gas research.
- Porton Down, Wiltshire, England — MoD: chalk downland and unique habitat with diverse fauna; long-term environmental documentation.
- Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, England — BBSRC: historic long-term experiments (Broadbalk, Park Grass) and an extensive insect survey network.
- Sourhope, Borders, Scotland — Macaulay Land Use Research Institute: rough grazing and pasture systems; long-term meteorological and soil/veg studies.
- Wytham, Oxfordshire, England — NERC: woodland/grassland ecosystem research with a strong history of ecological studies.
- Y Wydfa/Snowdon, Gwynedd, Wales — CCW/Welsh Office: rugged high-altitude environment with calcicolous grasslands and arctic/alpine flora; long-running grazing and vegetation studies.

## Data Management, Organization, and Governance
- ECN Steering Committee governs policy/decision-making; meets annually.
- ECN Executive Committee (ECNEX) handles urgent decisions; STAG provides technical and statistical guidance.
- NERC manages day-to-day operations via the Central Coordination Unit (CCU): standardization, data collection, and management.
- Site Managers at each location are responsible for data collection, processing, and transmission to the ECN Data Manager.
- Four full-time CCU staff (co-ordinator, statistician, data manager, assistant data manager) support centralized data standards and coordination.
- A meta-database and data archive underpin long-term data accessibility and cross-site analyses.
- Data and protocols are designed to integrate with sectoral networks and international monitoring programs wherever possible.

## Data Use and Outputs
- Standardized protocols enable cross-site comparisons and integration of datasets for detecting environmental changes.
- Outputs include long-term datasets, analytical resources, and data products suitable for researchers, policy makers, and public communication.
- Outputs are intended to promote data re-use, with consideration for early prototypes and feedback to improve products.

## Notable Considerations for Data Support
- Emphasis on “understanding the ask” and translating needs into data products (dashboards, reports, self-serve tools).
- Management of patchy datasets and diverse data formats across sites; data cleaning and transformation are core tasks.
- Ensuring outputs are accessible and widely shared/re-used; promoting outputs to maximize impact.
- Harmonisation with international data resources and use of area-based classification to guide sampling and data interpretation.
