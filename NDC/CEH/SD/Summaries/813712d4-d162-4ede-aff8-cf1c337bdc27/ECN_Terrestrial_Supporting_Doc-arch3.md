# Environmental Change Network Terrestrial Site Locations

## Overview and Purpose
- UK long-term, integrated environmental monitoring network designed to detect and understand environmental changes.
- ECN aims to provide uniform, comparable long-term datasets across selected terrestrial sites, enable integration and analysis to identify changes and causes, and supply data for research and future change predictions.
- Focus on monitoring both biota and physical/chemical environmental variables to support policy Evaluation, research, and decision-making.

## Context and Rationale
- Growing national and international interest in detecting environmental changes driven by climate, atmospheric composition, and land-use changes, with regional and local amplification or mitigation by local factors.
- UK monitoring historically decentralised and sectorally organised; ecologically, there was a need for long-term, comparable data across sites and sectors to inform policy and public reassurance.
- ECN provides a coordinated, long-term framework to synthesize data from multiple organisations and to contribute to national and international monitoring efforts.

## ECN Objectives
- Obtain uniform and comparable long-term datasets at selected sites through regular measurement of major environmental variables.
- Integrate and analyze datasets to identify environmental changes and understand their causes.
- Make long-term datasets available for research and for predicting future changes.
- Provide, for research purposes, representative sites with good instrumentation and reliable information.

## ECN Design Principles
- Ecological focus: monitor changes in selected biota in addition to physical and chemical environmental variables.
- Core measurements: define driving variables (climate, pollution, land use) and responsive variables that reflect ecosystem change; ensure variables are interpretable, informative, comparable, repeatable, and cost-effective across varied sites.
- Priority additional measurements: desirable but funded only if resources allow.
- Alignment with sectoral monitoring: where national schemes exist (e.g., butterfly monitoring, Insect Survey, bird surveys), ECN adopts compatible sampling designs to add national context.
- Data management: establish protocols for sampling, chemical analysis, quality control/assurance, and data storage.
- Statistical planning: dedicated working groups advise on site location, variable selection, sampling design, data analysis approaches, and resource needs.
- Reciprocal feedback: ongoing interaction between technical and statistical groups to refine design and implementation.

## Development and Implementation
- Step-by-step expansion: start with terrestrial sites, followed by freshwater (rivers and lakes) networks to run in parallel.
- Each contributing agency provides sites and resources; a national spine of sites is built with the aim of long-term operation (minimum ~30 years).
- Initial commitment and expansion: eight terrestrial sites committed in 1992; expanded to 11 sites by 1996; expansion plans to extend the core spine and add replicated sites across major UK environmental variation axes.

## Site Selection and Coverage
- Preliminary pool of 140 possible sites, refined to 24 terrestrial targets based on:
  - Broad geographic distribution across ecosystems
  - Long-term physical and financial security
  - History of consistent management and data records (preferably 10+ years)
  - Adequate site size and potential for future experimentation
- Financial security constraints shaped final site choices; physical security often ensured by existing research station locations.
- Terrestrial network established in 1992 with plans to broaden geographic representation and replication.

## Typical ECN Site Characteristics (Examples)
- Alice Holt Forest (Surrey, England): long-standing monitoring and multiple ongoing projects, European monitoring site for atmospheric deposition effects on trees.
- Drayton (Warwickshire, England): representative of Midland mixed farming; extensive pesticide, pest, and soil nitrogen studies; long-term agricultural data.
- Glensaugh (Grampian, Scotland): upland/lowland mix, long-running grazing and vegetation studies; historic resource management data.
- Hillsborough (County Down, Northern Ireland): grassland/forage research site with extensive meteorological and climate-related data.
- Moor House – Upper Teesdale (Cumbria/Durham, England): UNESCO Biosphere Reserve; upland/arctic-alpine communities; extensive long-term ecological experiments and climate-change research.
- North Wyke (Devon, England): grassland/farming systems with emphasis on nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas emissions from grasslands; long-term weather records.
- Porton Down (Wiltshire, England): chalk downland with rare habitats; unique preserved landscape with diverse flora and fauna; site of scientific interest and long-term ecological data.
- Rothamsted (Hertfordshire, England): historic long-term experiments (Broadbalk, Park Grass) with extensive insect monitoring; foundational data for agricultural/environmental change.
- Sourhope (Borders, Scotland): rough grazing and mixed farming; long-term meteorological and soil experiments; cashmere goats and sheep breeding research.
- Wytham (Oxfordshire, England): university research estate with long history in woodland and grassland ecology; TIGER program involvement; extensive biodiversity data.
- Y Wyddfa/Snowdon (Snowdonia, Wales): rugged montane site with calcicolous and arctic-alpine vegetation; grazing-focused research and alpine biodiversity.

## Operation, Governance, and Data Management
- Steering Committee: primary policy decision-making body; coordinates network-wide activities.
- ECN Executive Committee (ECNEX): handles urgent decisions and strategy development between Steering Committee meetings.
- STAG (Statistics and Technical Advisory Group): formed from the former Working Groups to advise on technical and statistical aspects.
- Central Coordination Unit (CCU): managed by NERC; standardizes procedures, coordinates data collection and management; staffed with full-time personnel (coordinator, statistician, data managers).
- Site Managers: each site’s sponsoring agency designates a site manager responsible for timely data collection, initial processing, and transmission to the ECN Data Manager.
- Data Protocols: standardized data collection, storage, and sharing formats; emphasis on quality assurance and metadata to support data reuse and verification.
- Integration with sectoral and international networks: ECN data supports and complements sectoral networks and international monitoring programs (e.g., UN-ECE IMP, UNEP GEMS, GRID).

## Data, Metadata, and Sharing
- Focus on quality-assured, well-documented data with clear protocols and metadata to enable verification and reuse.
- Public sharing of underlying data is a consideration and potential barrier; ECN emphasizes appropriate data governance and openness where feasible.
- Data are stored, managed, and analyzed to support long-term trend detection and hypothesis testing with appropriate statistical approaches.

## Integration with Other Monitoring Networks
- Data contribute to national and international integration efforts, enabling broader regional analyses and policy-relevant insights.
- Use of area-based land classification and alignment with existing sectoral monitoring schemes for enhanced value and comparability.

## Challenges and Sustainability
- Long-term funding and multi-agency commitments present ongoing challenges for maintaining a large, coordinated network.
- Achieving consistent replication and maintaining standardized protocols across diverse sites and organisations.
- Ensuring timely data access and maintaining high-quality metadata to support data validation and reuse.
- Balancing core mandatory measurements with potential additional measurements dependent on funding.
