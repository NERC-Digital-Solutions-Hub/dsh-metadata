# Perch weekly catches from Green Tuft 1946-2012

## Overview
- Dataset of total weekly catch data for mature perch (Perca fluviatilis) from Green Tuft, Windermere, Cumbria, sampled 1946–2012; Windermere has been monitored in the north and south basins since 1943.
- Collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and, since 1989, by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessor IFE.
- Related to phenology and population response studies (e.g., Ohlberger et al. 2014).

## Data content
- File: PerchWeeklyCatchesGreenTuft1946_2012.csv; size about 8 KB; CSV format.
- Columns: Year, Week, Catch (number of mature perch caught), Not_sampled (codes 'NS' denote not sampled that week).
- Sampling site: Green Tuft, Windermere lake, Cumbria, Great Britain. Coordinates provided (OS Grid and WGS84).

## Sampling design and collection
- Perch monitored in Windermere’s north basin at Green Tuft; sampling with variations in sites/efforts from 1943 onward.
- Collection method: unbaited wire-netting traps (dimensions specified) with 12 mm mesh, deployed 6 sets per spawning season.
- Traps deployed at 2–7 m depth, during daylight, typically lifted ~7 days later; six sets yield one spawning season’s data.
- All perch captured at the site were pooled and processed.

## Measurements and processing
- Laboratory processing: enumerate all fish; measure total length (to 1 mm), weigh (to 1 g); determine sex and reproductive state.
- Data used to calculate weekly total catches by numbers of mature perch.

## Quality control
- Measurements validated via permutations of three individuals.

## Data lineage and history
- Original data collected by FBA; transferred to CEH/IFE oversight since 1989.
