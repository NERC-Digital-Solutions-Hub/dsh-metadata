# Perch weekly catches from Green Tuft 1946-2012

## Dataset scope and purpose
- Total weekly catch data of mature Perch (Perca fluviatilis) from Green Tuft, Windermere, Cumbria, sampled 1946–2012.
- Collected to support long-term monitoring of perch populations; dataset used in ecological studies (e.g., Ohlberger et al. 2014).

## Provenance and related datasets
- Origin: data collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); since 1989, collected by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessors (IFE).

## Sampling design and methods
- Experimental design: unbaited, wire-netting traps deployed at Green Tuft (Windermere’s north basin) with 12 mm mesh; traps measure 740 mm × 590 mm × 640 mm; opening 80 mm.
- Sampling regime: six sets per year, deployed over a 6-week period between late April and early June; sites may vary year to year.
- Collection process: traps deployed during daylight, lifted about a week later; catches pooled by site for the year’s weekly totals.
- Analytical methods: entire catch enumerated; all fish measured (total length to 1 mm), weighed (to 1 g), and dissected to determine sex and reproductive state; used to calculate weekly total catches of mature perch.
- Scope of spatial/temporal data: data cover Green Tuft in Windermere’s north basin from 1946–2012, with ongoing monitoring in other basins since 1943.

## Quality control and data processing
- Quality control: measurements validated by permutations involving three individuals to ensure consistency.
- Data processing: raw catches plus biological measurements used to derive weekly mature perch counts.

## Governance, rights, and metadata
- Rights: dataset attributed to NERC—Centre for Ecology & Hydrology / Freshwater Biological Association (© 2014).
- Metadata and provenance: detailed collection methods, sampling regime, and site information included to support reproducibility and reuse.
- Related usage: dataset cited in literature (e.g., Ohlberger et al. 2014) and linked to additional Windermere time-series data.

## Data stewardship and maintenance considerations
- Continuity: data reflect a long-running time series with variations in sampling effort and site coverage over the decades; stewardship should document any regime changes and maintain links to related datasets.
- Metadata needs: preserve site details, collection methods, and QA procedures to ensure future discoverability and interoperability.
- Accessibility: dataset hosted within the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre; ensure ongoing access and clear licensing for reuse.
