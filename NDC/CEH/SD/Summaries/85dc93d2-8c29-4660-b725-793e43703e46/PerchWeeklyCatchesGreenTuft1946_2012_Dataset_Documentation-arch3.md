# Perch weekly catches from Green Tuft 1946-2012

- Purpose and scope
  - Long-term dataset of total weekly catches of mature perch (Perca fluviatilis) from Green Tuft, Windermere, Cumbria, spanning 1946–2012.
  - Collected to support ecological monitoring and as part of broader studies on perch phenology and population dynamics.

- Data content
  - Weekly counts of mature perch captured in unbaited traps.
  - Data originally collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); since 1989 collected by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessors (IFE).
  - Dataset used in ecological analyses such as Ohlberger et al. (2014).

- Sampling design and methods
  - Monitoring conducted in Green Tuft (Windermere’s north basin) with variations in sampling sites and effort from 1943–present.
  - Typical protocol: six sets of traps per spawning season, deployed for ~6 weeks, groups of five traps per set.
  - Traps: unbaited wire-netting traps (dimensions ~0.74 m × 0.59 m × 0.64 m; 12 mm mesh) with 80 mm opening.
  - Deployment: daytime; lifted ~7 days later; depths 2–7 m on perch spawning grounds.
  - Initial and ongoing sampling overlaps years and locations within Windermere.

- Measurement, processing, and data products
  - All captured perch counted; each fish measured (total length to 1 mm), weighed (to 1 g), and dissected to determine sex and reproductive state.
  - Data used to calculate total catches by number of mature perch for each week.
  - Quality checks involve repeating measurements with permutations of three individuals.

  - Related publication datasets cited for context and reuse.

- Data provenance and governance
  - Original data collection by FBA; CEH and its predecessor IFE continued collection since 1989.
  - Part of data used to inform broader ecological analyses and datasets available via NERC Environmental Information Data Centre.
  - Associated publication: Paxton et al., 2004 (Biotic and abiotic influences on recruitment of perch in Windermere).

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a long-term, standardized time series of mature perch abundance essential for trend analysis and phenology studies.
  - Highlights data governance considerations: longitudinal data maintenance, metadata completeness, and traceability to collection methods.
  - Demonstrates handling of sampling effort variability, missing weeks (Not_sampled), and quality control in environmental monitoring datasets.
