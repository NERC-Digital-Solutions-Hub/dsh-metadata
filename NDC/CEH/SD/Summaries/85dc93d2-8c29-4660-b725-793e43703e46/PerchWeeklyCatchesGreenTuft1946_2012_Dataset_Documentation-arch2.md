# Perch weekly catches from Green Tuft 1946-2012

## Overview
- A dataset of total weekly catches of mature perch (Perca fluviatilis) from Green Tuft, Windermere, Cumbria, sampled between 1946 and 2012.
- Collected in Windermere’s north basin; part of a long-running monitoring program that has included the north and south basins since 1943.
- Data originally collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and since 1989 by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessors.
- One of the data sources used in Ohlberger et al. (2014) on phenology and population responses to trophic mismatch.

## Sampling design and scope
- Long-term trapping program in Green Tuft (Windermere’s north basin) with variations in sampling sites and efforts from 1943 onward.
- Year range for this dataset: 1946–2012.
- Traps: unbaited wire-netting traps of sizes around 740 x 590 x 640 mm with 12 mm mesh.
- Sampling period: typically six sets per spawning season, deployed over late April to early June, at depths of 2–7 m.
- Sampling method yields a weekly dataset aligned to the week of the year.

## Field collection and laboratory methods
- Traps deployed in groups of five; each group fished for about six weeks within a spawning season; lifted about seven days after deployment.
- All perch from traps pooled by site, then processed in the lab.
- Measurements per fish: total length (to 1 mm), wet mass (to 1 g), sex, and reproductive state.
- Objective: calculate weekly total catches by the number of mature perch.

## Data processing and quality control
- In the laboratory, entire catches are enumerated and processed; sub-sampling is used when numbers are large, stratified by length class.
- Quality control involves verification of measurements by permutations across three individuals.
