# Perch weekly catches from Green Tuft 1946-2012

## Overview
- Dataset of total weekly catch data of mature perch (Perca fluviatilis) from trapping at Green Tuft, Windermere, Cumbria, sampled between 1946 and 2012.
- Collected initially by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); since 1989 by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessor IFE.
- Related to broader Windermere monitoring programs (north and south basins) dating from 1943 to present.

## Data scope and sampling sites
- Location: Green Tuft, Windermere lake, Cumbria, Great Britain (approx. OS Grid NY374019; lat/long 54.409297, -2.965951).
- Sampling regime: Perch monitored in Windermere’s north and south basins; this dataset specifically from Green Tuft in the north basin.
- Time coverage: 1943–present broader program; this file covers 1946–2012.
- Sampling approach: Unbaited wire-netting traps deployed in sequences (six sets per spawning season; five traps per gang; 2–7 m depth) during daylight for about six weeks per year.

## Data collection and processing
- Collection method: Traps of specified dimensions (approx. 740 x 590 x 640 mm; 12 mm mesh) with an 80 mm opening.
- Processing: All perch captured in a trap set were brought to the lab; measured total length (to 1 mm), weighed (to 1 g), and dissected to determine sex and reproductive state.
- Outcome: Weekly totals of mature perch caught are calculated from the processed catch data.

## Data format and file details
