# Perch weekly catches from Green Tuft 1946-2012

- Overview: A dataset of total weekly catch data for mature Perca fluviatilis from Green Tuft, Windermere, Cumbria, sampled 1946–2012. Collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and subsequently by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) since 1989; linked to broader Windermere perch monitoring and related phenology research (Ohlberger et al. 2014).

- Data file details:
  - Format: CSV
  - Size: 8 KB
  - Columns: Year, Week, Catch (number of mature perch), Not_sampled (code 'NS' if not sampled)
  - Location: Green Tuft, Windermere, Cumbria, GB
  - Approximate grid reference: NY374019; OS Grid Easting/Northing 337402,501968; coordinates 54.409297, -2.965951

- Experimental design and sampling regime:
  - Geography: North basin of Windermere; Green Tuft site
  - Sampling method: Unbaited wire-netting traps with specific dimensions (lengths ~740, 590, 640 mm; opening ~80 mm; 12 mm mesh)
  - Sampling schedule: Six trap sets per year from late April to early June; traps deployed for ~7 days each set
  - Depth: 2–7 m
  - Collecting approach: Traps deployed/collected during daylight; perch pooled per site for laboratory processing

- Data collection and processing:
  - In the lab: Entire catch enumerated; measured total length (to 1 mm) and wet mass (to 1 g); determined sex and reproductive state
  - Output: Total catches by number of mature perch for each week
  - Sub-sampling: Applied when numbers were large, stratified by length class

- Data quality and provenance:
  - Quality control: Measurements cross-checked by permutations of three individuals
  - Provenance: Data originally gathered by FBA; managed by CEH/IFE since 1989
