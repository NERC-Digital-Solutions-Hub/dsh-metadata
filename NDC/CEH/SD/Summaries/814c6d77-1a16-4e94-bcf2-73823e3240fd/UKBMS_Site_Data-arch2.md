# Experimental design/sampling regime

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) collects data from over 2,000 sites annually across the UK to monitor butterfly abundance and habitat management effects using standardized methods.
- Most sites use fixed transect counts to enable year-to-year comparisons; additional methods include timed counts and egg/larval web counts for specific species or contexts.
- Data collection aims to provide consistent indicators of environmental health and policy performance over time, with standardized procedures and quality assurance.

- All-species transects
  - Fixed-route line transect at a site, recording all butterflies along the route weekly under defined weather conditions.
  - Typical length: 2–4 km; time: 45 minutes to 2 hours; divided into habitat/management sections.
  - Data captured: all butterfly species within a fixed 5 m wide band along the transect, ideally 26 counts per year (weekly from early April to late September).
  - Transect routes are kept fixed to ensure comparability across years.
  - Typical survey window: 10:45–15:45, with weather constraints: dry, wind < Beaufort 5, and temperature thresholds (≥13°C with ≥60% sunshine or ≥17°C if overcast).

- Single-species transects
  - Follow the same all-species methodology but record only a focal species and only for a subset of weeks during its flight period.

- Timed counts and egg/larval web counts
  - Timed counts record the abundance of a target species over a defined period and area, following similar time and weather constraints.
  - Egg/larval web counts document eggs or larval webs for species in suitable habitats (e.g., Marsh Fritillary).

- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS)
  - Reduced-effort sampling to cover wider countryside habitats (established 2009).
  - Based on the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) approach: two parallel 1-km transects within randomly selected 1-km squares; fixed-route methodology.
  - Visits: 2–4 per year (minimum 2 visits in July/August; spring visits encouraged) versus 26 visits for standard transects.

- Data collection methods
  - Site location data captured in the field when transects or counts are set up.
  - Data entry via the UKBMS data entry site (http://www.ukbms.org/mydata) or Transect Walker software (free download).
  - Data input by the recorder or the regional transect coordinator; route changes create a new site with a new site number.
  - Online data and Transect Walker files uploaded to an Oracle database.

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Site location data include OS grid reference, transect length (m), number of sections, and WCBS status.
  - Grid reference is broken down into Easting (X) and Northing (Y) coordinates.
  - Some WCBS data may be incomplete due to randomised 1-km squares.

- Quality control
  - Each site reports to a regional transect coordinator who validates records.
  - After preliminary checks, data undergo automated and manual validation to ensure accuracy of site location and related fields.

- Format of stored data
  - Site Location Data stored as CSV files.
  - Key columns include:
    - Site number, Site name
    - Gridreference (OS), Easting, Northing
    - Length (m), Country, No. of Sections
    - No. Yrs surveyed, First year surveyed, Last year surveyed
    - Survey type (WCBS or UKBMS)
