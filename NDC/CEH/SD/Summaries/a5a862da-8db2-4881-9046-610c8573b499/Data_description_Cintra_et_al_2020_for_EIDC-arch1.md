# Data access and conditions

## Overview
- Provides open access to tree ring isotope data (oxygen δ18Otr and carbon δ13Ctr) for two Amazonian tree species across five sites, enabling climate signal analysis and comparisons between forest types.
- Species and sites chosen to represent seasonal floodplain forests (Macrolobium acaciifolium) and terra firme forests (Cedrela odorata) with broad spatial coverage.

## Data content
- Isotopic measurements:
  - δ18Otr (oxygen) and δ13Ctr (carbon) per tree ring
- Temporal resolution:
  - High-resolution sub-annual data or annual resolution (as described)
- Metadata per record:
  - Year of ring formation
  - Delta value (isotope ratio relative to standard; in permille, ‰)
  - Isotope type (oxygen or carbon)
  - Data_type (high-resolution or annual)
  - Ring_subsection (ring count for high-resolution)
  - Core (increment core ID)
  - Species
  - Site and geographic coordinates (Site_longitude, Site_latitude)

## Data structure and standards
- Standards:
  - δ13C referenced to Vienna-PDB
  - δ18O referenced to Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW)
- Data fields include site location details and measurement context for reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.

## Provenance and funding
- Sample preparation conducted at the University of Leeds.
- Isotope ratio measurements performed at the Stable Isotope Laboratory, University of Leicester.
- Funded by NERC grants:
  - Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Changes in the Amazon Hydrological Cycle (Newton Fund)
  - Amazon Hydrological Cycle; past, present and future
- Brazil-based support: CNPQ scholarships and universal grants

## Relevance for analysts
- Supports correlation and modelling of climate signals across multiple sites and forest types.
- Open and well-documented dataset with clear metadata, enabling data integration and reproducibility.
- Useful for cross-site comparative analyses and for developing predictive insights about hydrological and climatic influences on isotope proxies.
