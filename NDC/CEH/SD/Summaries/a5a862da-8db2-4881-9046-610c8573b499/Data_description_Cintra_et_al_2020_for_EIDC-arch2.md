# Amazon tree ring isotope records of Macrolobium acaciifolium and Cedrela odorata

## Overview
- Datasets of tree ring oxygen (δ18Otr) and carbon (δ13Ctr) isotopes from five Amazon sites: Pacaya (Peru), Maranon (Peru), Leticia (Colombia), Manuripi (Bolivia), and Riberalta (Bolivia).
- Species represent two forest types: seasonal floodplain (Macrolobium acaciifolium) and terra firme (Cedrela odorata).
- Sites provide broad spatial coverage to explore how climate influences isotope signals.
- Sample preparation occurred at the University of Leeds; isotope measurements were conducted at the Stable Isotope Laboratory, University of Leicester.
- Funded by NERC-UK Newton Fund and related NERC projects, plus Brazilian CNPQ support.

## Data content and format
- Year: Year of tree-ring formation.
- Delta: Isotope ratio value relative to a standard; δ (permille, ‰) = (R_sample / R_std − 1) × 10^3.
  - δ13C standard: Vienna-PDB.
  - δ18O standard: Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW).
- Isotope: Either oxygen (δ18Otr) or carbon (δ13Ctr).
- Data_type: High-resolution sub-annual sampling or annual resolution.
- Ring_subsection: Ring section count for high-resolution data.
- Core: Increment core identification number.
- Species, Site, Site_longitude, Site_latitude: Taxon and geolocation data.

## Spatial and temporal scope
- Five geographically distributed sites across the Amazon basin to capture spatial variation in isotope signals over time.

## Data processing and quality
- All lab work related to sample preparation and weighing was performed at the University of Leeds.
- Isotope ratio measurements were performed at the Stable Isotope Laboratory, University of Leicester.
