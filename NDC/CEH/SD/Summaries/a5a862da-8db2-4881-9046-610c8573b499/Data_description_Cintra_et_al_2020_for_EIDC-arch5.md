## Description and scope
- Dataset includes tree ring isotope data: oxygen (δ18Otr) and carbon (δ13Ctr)
- Species: Macrolobium acaciifolium (seasonal floodplain forest) and Cedrela odorata (terra firme)
- Geographic coverage: five sites in the Amazon basin
  - Pacaya (Peru)
  - Maranon (Peru)
  - Leticia (Colombia)
  - Manuripi (Bolivia)
  - Riberalta (Bolivia)
- Purpose: representative of two forest types and spatially distributed to explore how climate affects isotope signals
- Data provenance: sample preparation at University of Leeds; isotope ratio measurements at Stable Isotope Laboratory, University of Leicester
- Funding: multiple grants from NERC, Newton Fund, and Brazilian agencies

## Data structure and content
- Year: year of ring formation
- Delta: isotope value relative to standard (‰)
  - δ13C standard: Vienna-PDB
  - δ18O standard: Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW)
- Isotope: either oxygen (δ18Otr) or carbon (δ13Ctr)
- Data_type: high-resolution (sub-annual) or annual
- Ring_subsection: ring section count for high-resolution data
- Core: incremental core identifier
- Species: scientific name
- Site: site location name
- Site_longitude / Site_latitude: geographic coordinates

## Methodology and data quality
- Clear lineage of data handling: preparation and measurements performed at specified institutions
- Metadata fields available to support discovery, interoperability, and reuse
- Sub-sets describe different resolution levels for isotope data, enabling both annual and sub-annual analyses

## Geographic and temporal coverage
- Five sites spanning Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia within the Amazon Basin
- Data structure supports spatially explicit analyses of isotope signals in relation to climate

## Governance, stewardship, and usage notes
- Data licensing and citation requirements support proper attribution
- Clear data provenance (laboratories, institutions) aids reproducibility and traceability
- Contact points provided for data access and enquiries (see below)
