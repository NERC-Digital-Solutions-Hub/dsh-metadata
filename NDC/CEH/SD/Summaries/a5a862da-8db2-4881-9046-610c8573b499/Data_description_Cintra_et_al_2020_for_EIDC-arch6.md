## Data description
- Content: Tree ring oxygen (δ18Otr) and carbon (δ13Ctr) isotope data for two species across five Amazon sites.
- Species and forest types:
  - Macrolobium acaciifolium (seasonal floodplain forest)
  - Cedrela odorata (terra firme forest)
- Sites: Pacaya (Peru), Maranon (Peru), Leticia (Colombia), Manuripi (Bolivia), Riberalta (Bolivia)
- Purpose: Spatial coverage across the Amazon to explore climate-related isotope signals.
- Workflow: Sample preparation (ring sections, cellulose extraction, weighing, packing) conducted at the University of Leeds; isotope ratio measurements performed at the Stable Isotope Laboratory, University of Leicester.
- Funding sources:

- Site: Site name/location
- Site_longitude / Site_latitude: Geographic coordinates

## Methodology and provenance
- Data resolution: High-resolution sub-annual or annual ring data
- Standards and measurement:
  - δ13C referenced to Vienna-PDB
  - δ18O referenced to SMOW
- Sample handling: All preparation and processing steps described (ring cutting, cellulose extraction, weighing, packing) were performed in designated institutions as above
- References: See Cintra et al. 2019 for high-resolution sampling details

## Geographic scope
- Across five Amazon sites to achieve broad spatial coverage and facilitate comparisons of isotope signals with differing climate and forest types.
