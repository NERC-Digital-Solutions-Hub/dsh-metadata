# Amazon tree ring isotope records of Macrolobium acaciifolium and Cedrela odorata

## Overview
- Data record of tree ring oxygen (δ18Otr) and carbon (δ13Ctr) isotope values from five sites across the Amazon Basin.
- Species chosen to represent two forest types: seasonal floodplain forests (Macrolobium acaciifolium) and terra firme forests (Cedrela odorata).
- Sites span Pacaya (Peru), Marañón (Peru), Leticia (Colombia), Manuripi (Bolivia), and Riberalta (Bolivia) to achieve broad spatial coverage and probe climate–isotope relationships.
- Data include year of ring formation and isotope measurements, enabling investigation of hydrological/climate signals in tree rings.
- Preparation and analysis: sample prep at University of Leeds; isotope ratio measurements at the Stable Isotope Laboratory, University of Leicester.
- Data designed to support monitoring and understanding of environmental health indicators linked to the Amazon hydrological cycle.

## Data content and structure
- Variables captured:
  - Year: year of ring formation.
  - Delta: isotope ratio value relative to a standard (δ in ‰).
  - Isotope: either δ18O (for oxygen) or δ13C (for carbon).
  - Data_type: high-resolution sub-annual sampling or annual resolution.
  - Ring_subsection: ring section count for high-resolution sampling.
  - Core: increment core identification number.
  - Species: scientific species name (Macrolobium acaciifolium or Cedrela odorata).
  - Site: site location name.
  - Site_longitude / Site_latitude: geographic coordinates of sample location.
- Dataset emphasizes both temporal detail (high-resolution vs annual) and spatial breadth (five sites across Peru, Colombia, Bolivia).

## Methods and provenance
- Sample preparation performed at the University of Leeds (ring section cutting, cellulose extraction, weighing, packing).
- Isotope ratio measurements conducted at the Stable Isotope Laboratory, University of Leicester.
- Funding sources include:
  - NERC Newton Fund grants on Amazon hydrological cycle and past/present/future hydrology.
  - Brazilian CNPQ scholarships and universal grants.
- The data are curated to support clear presentation of findings and transparency in data provenance and methods.

## Data quality, governance, and reuse considerations
- Data openness supports transparency and reuse in monitoring and policy evaluation contexts.
- Important considerations and potential barriers for monitoring use:
  - Availability of metadata: adequate metadata is crucial for assessing data suitability.
  - Data transformation: isotope data may require format or unit harmonization for integration with other datasets.
  - Public sharing of underlying data: data governance processes must accommodate sharing while preserving data integrity.
  - Data updates: ongoing data maintenance to keep datasets current.
  - Data silos: coordination needed to avoid fragmentation across institutions.
- These factors align with the Monitoring Frameworks archetype’s emphasis on data quality, governance, and accessibility to inform policy decisions.

## Practical applications for monitoring and policy
- Use in assessing environmental health indicators linked to the Amazon hydrological cycle and climate variability.
- Spatially distributed isotope records can help attribute hydrological signals to regional climate drivers and transboundary influences.
- The dataset supports trend analysis, validation of climate models, and informing adaptive management across forest types (floodplain vs terra firme).
- Open, well-documented data enhance transparency for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders evaluating environmental health and climate resilience in the Amazon.
