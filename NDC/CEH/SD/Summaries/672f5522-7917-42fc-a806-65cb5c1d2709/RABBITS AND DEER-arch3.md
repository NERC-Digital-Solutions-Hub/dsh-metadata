# Errata for dataset https://doi.org/10.5285/672f5522-7917-42fc-a80665cb5c1d2709

- What the erratum notes
  - A few data points in the ECN dataset have been altered or removed following updated information from ECN site managers.
- Causes of changes
  - Updates are related to instrument error and/or coding changes.
- Data removal policy and rationale
  - Data are removed from the ECN database only if they are clearly in error.
  - Apparent errors may be valid outliers, so they are not automatically discarded.
- Implications for data quality and governance (relevant to monitoring frameworks)
  - Highlights the need for provenance, audit trails, versioning, and transparent rationale for corrections.
  - Underscores metadata quality and documentation of instrument/coding changes.
  - Balancing openness with data integrity; maintain clarity about corrections when sharing data publicly.
- Practical implications for monitoring framework authors
  - Update analyses and conclusions to reflect errata; ensure comparability across versions.
  - Communicate corrections to stakeholders and reference the errata in results.
  - Establish processes to capture, publish, and link errata to data originators, adhering to data governance standards.
