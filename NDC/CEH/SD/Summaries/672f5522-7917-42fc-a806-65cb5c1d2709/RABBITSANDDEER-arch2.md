# Errata for dataset https://doi.org/672f5522-7917-42fc-a80665cb5c1d2709

## What this errata covers
- A few data points within the ECN dataset have been altered or removed following updated information from Environmental Change Network (ECN) site managers.
- Updates relate to instrument error and/or coding changes.

## Rationale for changes
- Data are removed from the ECN database only if they are clearly in error; apparent errors may be valid outliers.
