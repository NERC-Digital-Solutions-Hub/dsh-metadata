# Errata for dataset https://doi.org/10.5285/672f5522-7917-42fc-a80665cb5c1d2709

- Summary of changes
  - A few data points in the Environmental Change Network (ECN) dataset have been altered or removed following updated information from ECN site managers.
  - Updates pertain to instrument error and/or coding changes.
  - Data are removed only when they are clearly in error; apparent errors may be valid outliers.

- Data governance implications
  - Highlights the need for clear provenance and traceability of corrections.
  - Emphasizes preserving data integrity while documenting why and how changes were made.
  - Supports the practice of versioning and maintaining access to updated and, where appropriate, original data.

- Actions for Data Stewards
  - Update metadata, data dictionaries, and documentation to reflect the corrections and any coding changes.
  - Maintain a changelog or.update log detailing what changed, why, and when.
  - Preserve or provide access to previous data versions to support transparency and reproducibility.
  - Ensure relevant data portals and catalogs are updated; communicate changes to users and stakeholders.
  - Review data intake and QA processes to reduce similar issues, including better handling of instrument errors and coding schemes.
  - Include explicit notes on outliers versus errors and the rationale for any removals.

- Notes for data users (context for stewardship considerations)
  - Be aware that selected data points were updated; consult the changelog for specifics.
  - Updated data may affect analyses; consider re-running analyses with the corrected dataset.
