# BU Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits and deer (rabbits: Oryctolagus cuniculus; deer: red Cervus elaphus and roe Capreolus capreolus) to understand their impact on vegetation structure and habitat.
- Use a droppings-count index as a practicable proxy for relative abundance, enabling detection of temporal changes (e.g., past fluctuations like myxomatosis effects).

## Method
- Population indicator based on counts of droppings along transects, not direct population size.
- Location strategy aligns with ECN butterfly monitoring: use the same transect plus a second transect covering major habitat types not on the butterfly transect; extend to about 2 km for the first transect; tailor the second transect length to conditions (including agricultural sites with a field centre).

## Location
- Primary transect: same as ECN butterfly (IB) monitoring; extended to ~2 km.
- Secondary transect: covers major habitat types not encountered on the butterfly transect.
- Agricultural sites: secondary transect sited to include a field centre.

## Sampling
- Timing: late March and late September each year.
- Procedure: count droppings along predetermined transects to record relative abundance of rabbits and deer; zero counts are meaningful for long-term comparisons.
- Transect segmentation: existing butterfly transect divided into up to 15 sections by habitat type or management differences; secondary transect subdivided similarly; record section lengths and habitat type for each section.
- Pre-recording preparation: clear all droppings within 1 m of both transects two weeks before recording.
- Recording: walk transects at recording time and count droppings within the cleared zone; keep separate records for each section of each transect.
- Species identification: ensure the ability to distinguish rabbit/deer droppings from sheep droppings where present.
- Contextual data: accompany the data with information on site fencing, shooting, disease prevalence, or other rabbit/deer control measures.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Core identification and timing: first four parameters to uniquely identify each sampling occasion
  - Site Identification Code (e.g. T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g. PC)
  - Location Code (e.g. 01)
  - Sampling Date/time (including time if sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Core measurement: vertebrates - rabbits and deer (BU Protocol)
  - Recording units: number of rabbit droppings; number of deer droppings
  - Transect section: section number; transect section length
  - Habitat description: coded description (units: character code)
- Data submission: to ECNCCU; refer to ECN data transfer documentation for dataset formats; access via restricted Site Managers' extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
- Data fields included per sampling occasion: site ID, core measurement code, location code, date cleared of droppings, date recorded, transect section, counts of droppings (rabbit/deer), transect section length, habitat description; precision of recording = 1
- Recording forms: two forms available
  - Form 1: droppings counts for rabbits and deer
  - Form 2: lengths and habitat types for each section; to be completed in the first survey year and whenever habitat or transect sections change
- Note: Transect sections across both transects must be numbered sequentially so that they are unique within each ECN site.
