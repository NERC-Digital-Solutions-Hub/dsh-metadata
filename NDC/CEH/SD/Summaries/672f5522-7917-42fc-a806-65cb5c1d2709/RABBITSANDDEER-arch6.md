# Errata for dataset https://doi.org/10.5285/672f5522-7917-42fc-a80665cb5c1d2709

## What happened
- A few data points within this dataset have been altered or removed following updated information from the Environmental Change Network (ECN) site managers.

## Why
- Updates are related to instrument error and/or coding changes.

## Data handling principle
- Data are only removed from the ECN database if they are clearly in error.
- Apparent errors may be valid outliers, so they are not automatically treated as invalid.
