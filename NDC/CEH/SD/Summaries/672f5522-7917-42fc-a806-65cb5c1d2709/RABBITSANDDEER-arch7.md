# Errata for dataset https://doi.org/10.5285/672f5522-7917-42fc-a80665cb5c1d2709

## Overview
- Errata notice for the referenced ECN dataset.
- A subset of data points has been altered or removed following updated information from Environmental Change Network (ECN) site managers.

## What changed
- Updates relate to instrument error and/or coding changes.
- Data are removed from the ECN database only if they are clearly in error; the guidance emphasizes that apparent errors may represent valid outliers.

## Implications for GIS analysis
- Data quality and trust: improvements to accuracy but require awareness of what was changed.
- Provenance and reproducibility: important to track the specific errata version used in analyses and maps.
- Potential effects on time-series, spatial analyses, and anomaly detection due to altered/removed points.
- Outliers may still be valid; exercise caution when interpreting anomalies.

## Practical considerations for GIS Specialists
- Use the corrected dataset version and document the errata reference in data sources.
- Reprocess maps and analyses if previously relying on altered/removed points.
- Clearly label or flag data points that were changed or removed to maintain transparency in map products.

## Recommendations
- Maintain data provenance by recording version and errata details.
- When sharing maps or analyses, note the updates and their impact on results.
- Verify consistency across data layers that may rely on the same ECN data.
