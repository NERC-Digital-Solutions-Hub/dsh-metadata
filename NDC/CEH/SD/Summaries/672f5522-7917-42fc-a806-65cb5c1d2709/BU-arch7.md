# RABBITS AND DEER

- Objective: Monitor broad changes in rabbit and deer populations (Oryctolagus cuniculus; red deer Cervus elaphus; roe deer Capreolus capreolus) in the UK using droppings counts as an index of relative abundance; aims to detect significant population shifts (e.g., post-mmyxomatosis dynamics).

- Spatial sampling design:
  - Reuse the ECN butterfly monitoring transect as the primary transect, extended to 2 km.
  - Establish a second transect covering major habitat types not present on the butterfly transect; length tailored to conditions (agricultural sites may include a field centre).
  - Transsects are treated as sampling locations for data recording.

- Sampling cadence and scope:
  - Conduct droppings counts in late March and late September.
  - Record zero counts, as they are informative for trend comparisons.

- Transect segmentation and habitat recording:
  - Primary butterfly transect divided into up to 15 sections by discrete habitat types or management differences; secondary transect subdivided similarly.
  - For each section: record transect length and habitat type description.
  - Ensure transect sections are uniquely numbered across both transects within the site.

- Field procedures and data quality:
  - Clear droppings within 1 m of the transects on both sides two weeks before recording.
  - During recording, recount droppings within the cleared zone.
  - Maintain separate records for each transect section.
  - Distinguish rabbit/deer droppings from sheep droppings when present.
  - Include information on any rabbit/deer control (fencing, shooting) and disease prevalence.

- Data structure and recording conventions:
  - Core data are recorded as site-specific sampling locations with a unique combination of:
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date/Time (including time if sampling is more frequent than daily)
  - Core measurement: vertebrates – rabbits and deer (BU Protocol).
  - Each transect section acts as a sampling location (e.g., 01, 02, etc.).
  - Required data fields for each record:
    - Date droppings cleared
    - Date droppings recorded (sampling date)
    - Transect section
    - Number of rabbit droppings
    - Number of deer droppings
    - Transect section length
    - Habitat description (character code, e.g., Tn)
  - Recording precision: 1–0.1 as specified in dataset documentation.
  - Recording forms:
    - One form for droppings counts
    - One form for lengths and habitat types (to be completed in the first year and whenever habitat or transect segmentation changes)
  - Ensure transect sections are numbered sequentially across both transects and are unique within each ECN site.

- Data management and access:
  - Data submission to ECNCCU; refer to accompanying Data Transfer documentation for ECN dataset formats.
  - Access to documentation via restricted ECN Site Managers' extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

- GIS applicability:
  - Data are organized by transect sections with precise spatial labeling (site code, location code, section, length, habitat), enabling map-based visualization of relative abundance by location and habitat.
  - Time-series data from twice-yearly surveys support trend analysis and habitat association mapping.
