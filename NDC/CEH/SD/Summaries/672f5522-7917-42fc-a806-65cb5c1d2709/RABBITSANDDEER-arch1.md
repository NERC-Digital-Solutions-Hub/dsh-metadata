# Errata for dataset https://doi.org/10.5285/672f5522-7917-42fc-a80665cb5c1d2709

## What changed
- A few data points within the ECN dataset have been altered or removed following updated information from Environmental Change Network (ECN) site managers.
- Updates relate to instrument error and/or coding changes.

## Rationale for removals
- Data are removed from the ECN database only if they are clearly in error.
- The principle maintained is that apparent errors may still represent valid outliers.
