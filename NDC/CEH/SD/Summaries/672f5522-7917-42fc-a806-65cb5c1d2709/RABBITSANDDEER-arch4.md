# Errata for dataset https://doi.org/10.5285/672f5522-7917-42fc-a80665cb5c1d2709

- Summary
  - A small number of data points in the ECN dataset have been altered or removed following updated information from ECN site managers.
  - Updates address instrument error and/or coding changes.
  - Data are removed only when clearly in error; apparent errors may still be valid outliers and thus are not necessarily deleted.

- Rationale and process
  - The errata reflect ongoing data quality control and governance by ECN site managers.
  - The principle prioritizes data integrity while accommodating corrections and clarifications.

- Implications for Data Leaders
  - Highlights the importance of clear governance channels and site-manager input for data quality.
  - Emphasizes updating metadata and maintaining versioning to reflect corrections.
  - Affects reproducibility: analyses using the dataset may need re-evaluation after updates.
  - Reinforces that outliers may be retained unless demonstrably erroneous, preserving data coverage.

- Actions for organisations
  - Establish procedures for documenting and communicating data corrections via errata.
  - Ensure data catalogs link to errata and updated metadata.
  - Review data quality practices to distinguish true errors from valid outliers.
