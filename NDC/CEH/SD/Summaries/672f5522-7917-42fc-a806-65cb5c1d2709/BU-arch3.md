# BU Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and deer (red deer Cervus elaphus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) in the UK.
- Use droppings counts as an index of relative abundance to assess impacts on vegetation structure and plant diversity over large areas.
- Detect and interpret population changes over time, including responses to past events (e.g., myxomatosis in rabbits).

## Method
- Species monitored: rabbits and deer; droppings counts used as the primary index.
- Transects:
  - Use the same transect as ECN butterfly monitoring (IB), extended to about 2 km.
  - Add a second transect covering major habitat types not on the butterfly transect; length adjusted to site conditions (include field centre in agricultural sites).
- Sampling cadence:
  - Counts conducted twice yearly: late March and late September.
  - Zero counts are informative for future comparisons.
- Transect setup:
  - Butterfly transect divided into up to 15 sections by habitat type or management differences; second transect similarly subdivided.
  - Record transect section lengths and habitat descriptions.
- Data collection details:
  - Clear droppings within 1 m of the transects on both sides two weeks before counting.
  - Re-walk transects during recording to count droppings in the cleared zone.
  - Maintain separate records for each section of each transect.
  - Distinguish droppings of rabbits and deer from sheep where present.
  - Include information on site deer/rabbit control, and disease prevalence where relevant.

## Location and Sampling Documentation
- Recording locations: ECN Site with multiple transects; each transect section constitutes a sampling location (coded like 01, 02, etc.).
- Data collection timing:
  - Droppings cleared date and droppings recorded date (sampling date) documented for each section.
- Recording scope per site:
  - Separate records for each transect section; section length and habitat type captured for each.

## Recording Conventions and Data Specification
- Core identifiers (must be included for each dataset): 
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time (including time element if sampling frequency exceeds daily)
- Core measurement: vertebrates – rabbits and deer (BU Protocol)
  - Data captured as counts of rabbit and deer droppings per transect section per sampling occasion.
  - Each transect section treated as a single sampling location (01, 02, etc.).
  - Additional fields: transect section length, habitat description (coded), and units.
- Data submission format:
  - Refer to ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation (restricted access Site Managers’ extranet) for dataset formats.
  - Access requests can be directed to ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.
- Recording precision:
  - Counts and related measurements recorded with defined precision as per the accompanying data specification (e.g., integer counts, specified decimal precision where applicable).

## Recording Forms and Notes
- Recording forms:
  - One form for recording droppings (rabbit and deer).
  - One form to describe transect lengths and habitat types; to be completed in the first year and whenever habitat or transect configuration changes.
- Transect section numbering:
  - Transect sections are numbered sequentially across both transects to ensure unique identifiers within each ECN site.
- Additional notes:
  - Distinguish rabbit and deer droppings from sheep droppings where present.
  - Ensure data on site-level control measures and disease prevalence accompanies the data where applicable.
