# BU Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits and deer (rabbits: Oryctolagus cuniculus; deer: red Cervus elaphus and roe Capreolus capreolus) in the UK.
- Use an index method based on dropping counts to estimate relative abundance and detect changes over time, including past-like events (e.g., myxomatosis impact).

## Method
- Dropping counts along predefined transects to estimate relative abundance; no direct population size measurements.
- Two transects:
  - The same transect used for ECN butterfly monitoring (IB), extended to 2 km.
  - A second transect covering major habitat types not on the butterfly transect.
- Transects are subdivided into sections (not more than 15 per transect); each section’s length and habitat type are recorded.
- Droppings are counted twice yearly: late March and late September.
- Droppings within 1 m of the transects (on both sides) are counted after clearing a 2-week pre-count period.
- Separate records are kept for each section of each transect.
- Recorders must distinguish rabbit/deer droppings from sheep droppings where applicable.
- Data should accompany information on site rabbit/deer control and disease prevalence.

## Location
- Use the ECN butterfly monitoring transect (IB) extended to ~2 km.
- A second transect is established to represent habitat types not covered by the butterfly transect.
- Transects may be extended/adjusted to site conditions (e.g., agricultural sites include a field centre).

## Sampling
- Sampling occasions: late March and late September.
- For each transect section, record:
  - Number of rabbit droppings
  - Number of deer droppings
  - Transect section length (m)
  - Habitat description (coded)
- Transect sections across both transects are numbered sequentially to ensure unique identification within each ECN site.
- Zero counts are important for longitudinal comparisons.

## Recording conventions and data items
- Core data identifiers (required for all datasets):
  - Site Identification Code (unique ECN site code, e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC for a core measurement)
  - Location Code (replicate sampling location per core measurement, e.g., 01, 02)
  - Sampling Date/Time (date and time of data recording)
- Data fields to record:
  - Date droppings cleared
  - Date droppings recorded (sampling date/time)
  - Transect section
  - Number of rabbit droppings
  - Number of deer droppings
  - Transect section length (m)
  - Habitat description (character code)
- Precision conventions: recording precision as specified in the ECNCCU documentation (e.g., 1 or 0.1 for certain measurements).

## Recording forms
- Two forms available:
  - Form A: recording droppings (rabbits and deer)
  - Form B: describing transect lengths and habitat types
- Use Form B in the first year of survey and again if habitat changes or transect sections are altered.
- The number of transect sections depends on the habitat pattern at each site.
- Transect sections are numbered sequentially across both transects to remain unique within the ECN site.

## Note
- Transect sections are uniquely numbered within each ECN site to ensure consistent data linkage across time.
