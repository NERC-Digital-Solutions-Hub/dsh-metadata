# Errata for dataset https://doi.org/10.5285/672f5522-7917-42fc-a80665cb5c1d2709

## What this erratum covers
- A few data points within the dataset have been altered or removed.
- Updates come from Environmental Change Network (ECN) site managers.
- Changes relate to instrument error and/or coding changes.

## Rationale for changes
- Data are only removed from the ECN database if they are clearly in error.
- Apparent errors may be valid outliers, so some data may be retained.
