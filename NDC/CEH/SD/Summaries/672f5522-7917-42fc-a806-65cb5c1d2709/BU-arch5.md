# RABBITS AND DEER

## Aim
- Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and deer (red Cervus elaphus and roe Capreolus capreolus) across UK ecosystems.
- Use an index method based on dropping counts to estimate relative abundance, aligned with historical population trends (e.g., post-mymyxomatosis changes).
- Provide data that can reveal ecological impacts on vegetation structure and habitat for other organisms.

## Location
- Use the same transect as the ECN butterfly monitoring (IB), with possible extension to 2 km.
- Establish a second transect to cover major habitat types not present on the butterfly transect; length adapted to site conditions (e.g., include a field centre at agricultural sites).

## Sampling
- Timing: late March and late September each year.
- Procedure:
  - Count droppings along pre-determined transects to record relative abundance of rabbits and, where common, deer.
  - Divide the butterfly transect into up to 15 sections by discrete habitat types or management differences; extend the second transect similarly.
  - Record transect section length and habitat type for each section.
  - Clear all droppings within 1 m of the transects on both sides two weeks before recording; recount and record droppings at the time of measurement.
  - Maintain separate records for each section of each transect.
  - Distinguish droppings of rabbits/deer from sheep where present.
- Data context:
  - Include information about site-wide rabbit/deer control (fencing, shooting, etc.) and disease prevalence.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Data must be recorded using a standardized set of identifiers for every sampling location:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time
- Core measurement: vertebrates – rabbits and deer; counts are recorded as:
  - Number of rabbit droppings
  - Number of deer droppings
  - Transect section length
  - Habitat description (units: character codes)
- Additional recording details:
  - Date droppings were cleared
  - Date droppings were recorded
  - Transect section number
  - Recording precision (e.g., 1 or 0.1 as applicable)
- Format notes:
  - Data are aligned with ECNCCU data transfer documentation and may reside on restricted access portals; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

## Recording forms
- Two forms are provided:
  - One for recording droppings (rabbits/deer)
  - One for describing lengths and habitat types for each section
- Use:
  - The habitat/length form is completed in the first survey year and whenever habitat or transect sections change.
  - Transect section numbering should be unique across both transects within a site.

## Note
- Transect sections must be numbered sequentially across both transects so that they are unique within each ECN site.
- This protocol emphasizes data provenance, consistent metadata (site, core measurement, location, date), and the ability to compare zero counts over time, supporting robust long-term data stewardship.
