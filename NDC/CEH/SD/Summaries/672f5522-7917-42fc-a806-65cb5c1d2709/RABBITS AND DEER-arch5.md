# Errata for dataset https://doi.org/672f5522-7917-42fc-a80665cb5c1d2709

## What happened
- A few data points within the ECN dataset have been altered or removed following updated information from ECN site managers.
- Updates are related to instrument error and/or coding changes.
- Data are removed from the ECN database only if they are clearly in error; where apparent errors may still be valid outliers.

## Implications for Data Stewards
- Document corrections and maintain an audit trail and versioning for the dataset.
- Update metadata to reflect the changes, including the reason (instrument error, coding change) and the method used.
- Communicate changes to dataset users and consider the potential impact on analyses, especially regarding outliers.
- Coordinate with ECN site managers and data creators/sharers to ensure ongoing data quality and governance.

## Data governance and discovery considerations
- Ensure updated errata are discoverable and that dataset catalogs reflect the latest version and changes.
- Maintain transparency about data quality issues and the rationale for removals or alterations to support trust and reuse.
