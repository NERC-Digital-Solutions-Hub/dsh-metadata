# BU Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and deer (red deer Cervus elaphus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) in the United Kingdom.
- Use a droppings-count index method to estimate relative abundance, enabling detection of changes similar to historical events (e.g., rabbit declines after myxomatosis).

## Method

- Location and transects
  - Reuse the same transect as the ECN butterfly monitoring (IB) and extend to about 2 km.
  - Establish a second transect to cover major habitat types not present on the butterfly transect.
  - Transect length should suit site conditions; at agricultural sites include a field centre.

- Sampling schedule
  - Conduct counts in late March and again in late September.
  - Record droppings along transects to reflect relative abundance of rabbits and deer (if present).
  - Zero counts are retained as important for future comparisons.
  - Divide the butterfly transect into up to 15 sections by habitat type or management differences; extend the same approach to the second transect.
  - Record transect section length and habitat type for each section.

- Recording procedure
  - Clear droppings within 1 m of the transects on both sides two weeks before recording.
  - Re-walk transects at recording time and count droppings within the cleared zone.
  - Maintain separate records for each section of each transect.
  - Distinguish confidently between rabbit/deer droppings and sheep droppings where present.
  - Include information on any rabbit/deer control (e.g., fencing, shooting) and disease prevalence.

## Specification of results and recording conventions

- Key identifying variables (must be included in all datasets)
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time (including time if sampling is more frequent than daily)

- Core measurement
  - Vertebrates - rabbits and deer (BU Protocol)

- Data fields for each sampling occasion
  - Site Identification Code
  - Core Measurement Code
  - Location Code
  - Date droppings cleared
  - Date droppings recorded (Sampling date)
  - Transect section
  - Number of rabbit droppings
  - Number of deer droppings
  - Transect section length
  - Habitat description (Units = character code)
  - Precision of recording (e.g., 1, 0.1)

- Data transfer and formats
  - ECNCCU data transfer documentation specifies dataset formats.
  - Access to documentation requires contact with ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.

## Recording forms

- Two recording forms are provided by the CCU:
  - One for recording droppings of rabbits and deer.
  - One to describe lengths and habitat types for each section.
- The habitat/section form is completed in the first survey year and whenever habitat changes or transect sections are altered.
- The number of transect sections depends on habitat pattern at the site.

## Note

- Transect sections should be numbered sequentially across both transects, ensuring unique section identifiers within each ECN site.
