# BU Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor broad changes in rabbit and deer populations (rabbits: Oryctolagus cuniculus; deer: red Cervus elaphus and roe Capreolus capreolus) and use an index method based on droppings counts due to impractical direct population measurements.
- Detect changes in abundance over time and relate them to historical patterns (e.g., post-mmyxomatosis dynamics) and habitat factors.

## Method
- Use an index-based recording of droppings along transects as a proxy for relative abundance.
- Target species: rabbits and deer; record counts along predefined transects twice yearly (late March and late September).
- Compare changes across years and sites; zero counts are informative for trend assessment.
- Distinguish rabbit and deer droppings from sheep droppings where present; accompany data with context on disease prevalence and any control measures.

## Location
- Core transect: align with the ECN butterfly monitoring transect (IB), extending to about 2 km.
- Secondary transect: establish a separate transect covering major habitat types not represented on the butterfly transect; length adjusted to site conditions (e.g., include a field centre at agricultural sites).
- Transects are subdivided into habitat-based sections; sections are to be consistently defined and recorded.

## Sampling
- Timing: late March and late September each year.
- Procedure: clear all droppings within 1 m of the transects two weeks before recording; re-walk transects and record remaining droppings within the cleared zone.
- Recording: separate records for each section of each transect; keep separate counts for rabbits and deer.
- Data to collect per section: transect section length, habitat type (described with a habitat code), and the number of rabbit and deer droppings.
- Additional context to capture: rabbit/deer control measures (fencing, shooting) and prevalence of disease at the site or subareas.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Core variables required for each sampling occasion (identified by space and time): Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC for vertebrates—rabbits and deer), Location Code, Sampling Date/Time (including time if sampling is more frequent than daily).
- Data for vertebrates (rabbits and deer): 
  - Date droppings cleared
  - Date droppings recorded (sampling date)
  - Transect section
  - Number of rabbit droppings
  - Number of deer droppings
  - Transect section length
  - Habitat description (coded)
- Transect sections across both transects must be numbered sequentially to remain unique within each ECN site.
- Data recording forms specify two forms: one for dropping counts (rabbits and deer) and one for lengths and habitat types; used in the first year of survey and whenever habitat or transect sections change.
- Data standards and transfer: refer to the ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

## Recording forms
- Two forms are provided:
  - Droppings recording form (counts of rabbit and deer)
  - Habitat and transect description form (section lengths and habitat types)
- The habitat/length form is completed in the first year and whenever habitat changes or transect sections are altered.
- Transect section numbering is designed to be unique across both transects within each ECN site.

## Note
- Zero counts are important for trend comparison.
- If present, ensure separation of sheep droppings from those of rabbits and deer.
- The method is designed to detect changes consistent with historical patterns and to support cross-site data integration through standardized recording conventions.
