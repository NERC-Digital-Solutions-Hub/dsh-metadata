# Errata for dataset https://doi.org/10.5285/672f5522-7917-42fc-a80665cb5c1d2709

## Overview
- A few data points in the Environmental Change Network (ECN) dataset have been altered or removed following updated information from ECN site managers.
- Changes relate to instrument error and/or coding changes.
- Data are removed only if clearly in error; apparent errors may still be valid outliers.

## Implications for data users
- Analyses using this dataset may require re-evaluation of results around the modified points.
- Recalculate summaries or statistics that included affected data.
- Ensure provenance by documenting reasons for changes (instrument error vs coding changes).
- Update dashboards, reports, and data products to reflect the changes.
- When sharing results, note the errata and its potential impact.

## Considerations for Data Support
- Liaise with ECN site managers to verify changes and rationale.
- Maintain versioned datasets and a changelog to support reproducibility.
- Communicate updates to end users and provide guidance on interpreting the changes (e.g., distinguishing outliers from errors).
- Update documentation and user guides; consider re-sharing updated outputs or prototypes.
