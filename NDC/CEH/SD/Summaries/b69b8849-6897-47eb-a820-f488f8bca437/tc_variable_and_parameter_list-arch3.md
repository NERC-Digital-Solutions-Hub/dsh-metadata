# PLOT-SCALE  SIMULATIONS  WITH  MAIN-FRAME

- Purpose and scope
  - A comprehensive configuration for plot-scale ecosystem simulations using a mainframe-based framework.
  - Models environmental processes across vegetation types (High vs Low Vegetation) and multiple C crowns, spanning carbon, nutrient, water, and energy budgets.
  - Supports assessment and comparison of policy-relevant scenarios and informs decisions about monitoring approaches and data needs.

    - LEAK_* fluxes (leakage of DOC/DON/DOP/K/NH4/NO3/P from soil bottom)
    - Rg, Rm, Rh, Rmr, Rms, RmycAM/RmycEM, Rg_H/L, etc. (respiration and turnover terms across compartments)
  - Water, soil moisture, and hydrology
    - In_H/L (intercepted water storage high/low vegetation), SWE, In_SWE, V (soil water content and storage), ZR depths (root depths), Osat/Osat-like and Ks/Usle-related hydraulic parameters

    - Weather and radiation inputs (PARB, PARD, SAB1/2, SAD1/2, U, Ws, RH, Pre, Pr, etc.)
    - Forcing deposition and fertilization (DepN/DepP/DepK, FertN/FertP/FertK)

    - Various “Assigned Parameter” and “Internal Parameter” categories governing structure, stoichiometry, interception, rooting, leaf traits, and more
  - Time steps and data structure
    - Time scales include hourly (h) and daily (d) data; many outputs are time-series per crown or per pool
    - Datam and Date inputs provide explicit time context; DeltaGMT for time zone alignment
    - x1/x2 and similar fields indicate timing for input slices and simulation steps
  - Governance and metadata tendencies
    - Rich metadata is encoded for many variables (UNITS, TYPE, DESCRIPTION)
    - Emphasis on explicit data provenance (inputs, internal computations, and outputs) to support traceability and quality control

- For monitoring framework purposes
  - The model provides a robust, instrumented framework to generate environmental health indicators at plot scale, including:
    - Carbon balance indicators (NPP, NEE, biomass pools, litter production)
    - Water and energy flux balances (Rnet, QE, QH, Qv), soil moisture, snow, and interception dynamics
    - Vegetation health and productivity metrics (NDVI, NPP, LAI, SIF)
    - Nutrient cycling indicators (N, P, K pools, uptake, mineralization, and losses)
  - It supports scenario analysis for policy-relevant drivers:
    - Deposition and fertilization scenarios (N, P, K)
    - Climate and CO2 forcing variations
    - Vegetation management and structural changes (cases for High vs Low vegetation)
  - Data and governance implications
    - Demonstrates a structured approach to data inputs, metadata, and parameterization, highlighting the importance of metadata quality and data-sharing readiness
    - Reflects the complexity of integrating diverse data streams (forcing time series, deployment of internal parameters, and crown-level detail) for monitoring applications

- Practical takeaway for policy and decision-makers
  - This framework enables evaluation of environmental health under multiple management and climatic scenarios by producing a wide set of indicators across carbon, nutrient, water, and energy domains.
  - Its explicit data governance (metadata, forcing inputs, and parameter classifications) supports transparency, reproducibility, and better alignment with monitoring framework requirements.
  - The heavy emphasis on crown-level detail, per-pool accounting, and integrated budgets makes it a powerful tool for diagnosing drivers of ecosystem responses and for communicating findings to stakeholders.
