# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

## Overview and Aims
- Operational guide for surveying woodlands, detailing collection of ground flora, trees, saplings, shrubs, plot descriptions, habitats, and soils.
- Supports large-scale data collection (e.g., 1648 plots per site) with standardized forms, procedures, and documentation to enable later data analysis.
- Emphasizes permissions, public relations, and site-specific access as essential prerequisites.
- Data are intended to be comprehensive, traceable, and usable for long-term conservation and research.

## Data Elements and Data Model
- Core entities:
  - Site: site-specific description, overall habitats, management notes, and a set of plots.
  - Plot: 2x2 m to 14.14x14.14 m nested plots per site; central point with coordinates and a set of data collections.
  - Sampling data: four primary data streams per plot
    - Ground flora: presence/absence across multiple quadrat sizes with abundance estimates.
    - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, diameters/heights, and statuses (live, dead, stumps).
    - Plot description and habitats: slope, aspect, and various habitat attributes.
    - Soil data: profile descriptions from pit and auger, plus composite samples (top 10–15 cm).
- Ancillary data:
  - Herbarium specimens for species identification; codes and field names recorded; Appendix I provides collection instructions.
  - Site Description and Habitats form (site-wide), and Plot Description and Habitats form (per plot) to capture broader context.
- Coding and documentation:
  - Use of Code No columns for office use; standardized recording formats; forms align between site and plot data to facilitate data punching and integration.
  - Recording sheets, checklists, and examples provided in appendices to standardize data and minimize misidentification.

## Data Collection Process and Workflow
- Pre-survey planning:
  - Prepare an outline survey plan to minimize travel; decide base locations to optimize efficiency; obtain access permissions as required.
- Permissions and access:
  - Permission to survey is obtained from landowners or through regional offices; if refused, back up sites are utilized.
  - Emphasis on good public relations and transparent communication about conservation aims (not a purchase or compulsory survey).
- Locating sampling points:
  - Sites are mapped on 22" maps with 16 sampling points per site; points located within a 20 m radius of true position.
  - A two-step process to ground-truth: identify a nearby control point, orient with map and compass, then pace out distance with slope corrections when needed.
- Order of data collection:
  - Ground flora data collected first to minimize disturbance; tree saplings/shrubs and soil data follow; final site/plot descriptions and habitats documented.
- Plot layout:
  - Center point established; right-angle gauge randomizes plot orientation; corner poles mark expanding 2x2 m up to 10x10 m plots; sequential quadrat searches record species presence across sizes.
  - Bryophytes recorded comprehensively on vascular plant surveys; bryophytes on tree bases, rocks, and habitats may be collected as needed.
- Data capture formats:
  - Separate forms for ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot description/habitats, and soil data; site-level habitat and description forms also used.
  - Comprehensive codes and fields defined in appendices; data are entered with attention to accuracy and bias avoidance.
- Sample handling:
  - Collect herbarium specimens for unidentified plants; label specimens and field sheets clearly; ship (or back up) samples to Merlewood with standardized packaging.
  - Soil samples: small pit and auger cores; composite topsoil collected; store in labeled bags; mark if any deviations from planned sampling occur.

## Data Quality, Validation, and Documentation
- Data quality controls:
  - Emphasis on accuracy within a 20 m ground-truthing radius for point locations; objective, unbiased point selection to minimize subjective bias.
  - Cross-check forms after completion; ensure site and plot numbers align; ensure all samples and forms are fully completed and preserved.
  - Herbarium specimens accompany field data to verify species identities; use of reference codes and standard names to minimize misidentification.
- Documentation and traceability:
  - Appendices provide explicit instructions for herbarium collection (Appendix I), form completion (Appendix IV, V), and examples (Appendices II and III).
  - Forms are designed to be stapled and archived with soil and bryophyte samples; Boxed and shipped to central facilities for long-term storage.
- Handling of uncertainties:
  - If identification is uncertain, collect a specimen for later verification; if needed, annotate the field sheet with notes or request post-collection verification.
  - Complex or disturbed profiles should be diagrammed and fully annotated on the form if horizons are unclear.

## Permissions, Access, and Governance
- Ownership and responsibility:
  - Access to sites may be the responsibility of the field surveyors or coordinated by regional offices; permissions are handled with tact, goodwill, and minimization of disturbance.
- Public relations and purpose:
  - Clear communication that surveys are for conservation value, not purchases or compulsory actions; regional staff handle repercussions if relationships are strained.
- Data ownership and sharing:
  - Data are collected by the Nature Conservancy and shipped to Merlewood for processing; samples are stored under controlled conditions and dispatched by post.
- Data lineage and provenance:
  - Recorder initials, date, slope, aspect, plot and site identifiers, and equipment used are documented on every form to establish data provenance.

## Data Storage, Archiving, and Physical Data Management
- Physical data and samples:
  - Field sheets, herbarium specimens, and soil samples assembled per site; four site-bound boxes for field sheets and three boxes for soil samples; bryophytes stored with soil in an additional box if needed.
  - Materials packed securely, labeled, and shipped with prepaid labels; aim to keep individual parcel weights manageable.
- Tooling and equipment:
  - Comprehensive field kit lists provided (center pole, right-angle gauge, tapes, compass, hypsometer, auger, etc.); equipment tracks and checklists ensure consistent data collection across teams.
- Long-term data readiness:
  - Data are intended to be "collected forever," with thorough checks to minimize missing data; documented methods and forms facilitate future re-use and reanalysis.

## Appendices and Documentation (Supporting Data Standards)
- Appendix I: Instructions for herbarium specimen collection to ensure uniform identification.
- Appendix II: Examples of completed ground flora forms.
- Appendix III: Example of completed tree, sapling, and shrub form.
- Appendix IV: Instructions for completing plot and site description and habitat forms (plus examples).
- Appendix V: Instructions for collecting soil data and completing soil forms (plus two examples).
- Appendix VI: Equipment checklists and field gear layouts.

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- Standardization is embedded in the data flow: site form and plot form share attribute codes to enable consistent data integration.
- Metadata richness is built into the process: recorder, date, site/plot IDs, sampling order, and methods are captured to support reproducibility.
- Data governance emphasizes permissions and back-up plans, with a formal flow for site selection, access, and backup sites when access is denied.
- Data preservation strategy integrates physical artifacts (herbarium specimens, soil samples) with digital-analog data (forms), necessitating careful curation, labeling, and containerization.
- The methodology acknowledges data quality risks (incomplete understanding of user needs, timely data collection, interoperability challenges) and mitigates them through standardized forms, example datasets, and explicit handling instructions.
- For modern data stewardship, important takeaways include the value of:
  - Explicit data dictionaries and controlled vocabularies (as reflected by codes and form fields).
  - Provenance tracking (who recorded what, when, and under which conditions).
  - Clear data retention and archiving plans (physical and digital).
  - Documentation of data collection methods to enable reproducibility and future integration with new systems.
