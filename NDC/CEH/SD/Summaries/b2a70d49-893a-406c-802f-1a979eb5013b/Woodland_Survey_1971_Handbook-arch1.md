# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDHOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- A field-methods handbook for surveying woods to classify woodland types, describe habitats, and collect standardized data for analysis and comparison.
- Combines planning, permission, site access, sampling design, data collection, specimen collection, soil description, and data management to support later analysis.

## Purpose and scope
- Establishes a standardised procedure to identify correlations, report findings, and support predictions about actions in woodland contexts.
- Covers planning, data collection at multiple spatial scales, soil description, site and plot habitat descriptions, and specimen handling.

## Planning, access, and permissions
- Prepare an outline plan for surveying assigned woods, minimising travel while accounting for access problems.
- Obtain permission to enter and survey each site; guidance provided for cases with multiple owners or unclear ownership.
- Emphasises good public relations; explain purposes clearly to owners and avoid implying surveys will lead to purchase or compulsory action.
- If access is denied, use back-up sites and coordinate with Merlewood for required information.

## Sampling design and locations
- Each site includes a predetermined set of sampling points and plots to standardise data collection.
- Ground sampling points: 16 random points per site on a 22" site map, used to locate ground flora, tree saplings, and soil sampling.
- Plot layout: at each sampling point, a centre point with a right-angle gauge and concentric corner posts define progressively larger plots (2x2 m up to 10x10 m) with a 14.14 m overall plot.
- Aims for high accuracy (within about 20 m of true location) and minimal subjective bias in point placement.

## Order and method of recording data
- Data collection proceeds in a defined sequence, with at least four data sets plus soil samples per plot:
  - (a) Ground flora: record presence/absence in five growing quadrats, estimate percent cover for largest quadrat; collect bryophyte sample; collect unidentified species for herbarium.
  - (b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs: measure trees >5 cm DBH; record saplings and shrubs in diagonally opposite plot quarters; capture height of the largest tree.
  - (c) Plot description and habitats: record habitat attributes, slope, aspect, and other presence/absence features; include a ground-profile sketch.
  - (d) Soil data: extract a soil sample from the plot center for chemical and physical analysis; describe soil profile via pit and auger, including horizons Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C with detailed attributes.
- Data sheets are designed to be mutually compatible across plot and site forms; code numbers are used consistently to facilitate data handling.

## Ground flora (detailed)
- Use 2x2 m plots to capture presence/absence and species lists; also search within larger nested plots (up to 14.14 x 14.14 m) to capture all species across scales.
- Record bryophytes through bryophyte sampling in the vascular-plant survey, with dedicated herbarium specimens for uncertain identifications.
- Field sheets require careful recording of species names, codes, counts, and cover estimates.

## Trees, saplings, and shrubs (detailed)
- Trees: record species and diameter at breast height (DBH) for stems >5 cm; account for multiple stems on coppice stools; note dead trees/stems.
- Saplings: record height and DBH-equivalent measures for individuals within diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3.
- Shrubs: same data as saplings, restricted to diagonally opposite quarters.
- All plots culminate with measuring the height of the largest tree and noting any exceptional cases.

## Plot descriptor and habitats
- Capture presence/absence of a wide range of habitat attributes (e.g., slope, aspect, glades, boggy areas, streams, rock features, etc.) using standardized attribute definitions (Appendix IV).
- Include a ground-profile sketch and a narrative comment column for additional interpretation.

## Site description and habitats (site-wide data)
- A separate site form records overall site characteristics and habitat types; this complements the per-plot data.
- Includes marginal land use, boundary types, and landscape context (e.g., woodland type, hedges, streams, roads, railways) at the site scale.

## Soil data collection and interpretation
- Given resource limits (1648 plots), collect a limited set of physical/chemical measurements plus a numerical soil description using horizon-based attributes.
- Measured properties: pH, loss on ignition, and a simplified mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay proportions); additional samples retained for potential future analyses.
- Soil description uses horizon-by-horizon interpretation (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) with explicit criteria for moisture, color, texture, structure, mottling, and horizon boundaries.
- Horizon designation follows a standard sequence: Ao (organic surface), Al (mineral-organic mix), A2 (eluviation/bleaching), B1/B2 (deposition and weathering), and C/Underlying Material (parent material).
- Special notes cover gleyed horizons, presence/absence of humus, and how to handle disturbed or transitional profiles.
- When depth is limited by auger: document depth and provide bracketed notes for underlying material.

## Completion, data packaging, and documentation
- After data collection, forms and samples should be checked for completeness, properly labelled, and packed into designated boxes for transport.
- Site description and habitat forms, plot forms, and soil/bryophyte samples are organized in a structured, box-based system with pre-paid postage for mailing back to Merlewood or designated recipients.
- Emphasises thoroughness: confirm all items are complete, equipment returned, and no samples left behind.

## Herbarium specimens
- Leaders must prepare and submit herbarium specimens to demonstrate identification accuracy; collect type specimens where possible.
- Record precise species identifications, capture flowering material when possible, and label specimens clearly with field codes and names.
- Ensure consistency of coding: specimens collected under coded identities must be traceable to final identifications.

## Soil data form and interpretation instructions (Appendix)
- Provides a practical, field-friendly approach to soil profile description, including horizon-specific rules for:
  - A horizons (Ao, Al, A2)
  - B horizons (Bl, B2)
  - C underlying materials
  - Horizon transitions, texture, color, moisture, and structure
  - Handling of incipient podzols, gleyed horizons, and mixed mineral/organic layers
- Includes example completed forms to illustrate two common soil profile types.

## Field equipment and logistics
- Detailed list of field equipment needed for plots, soils, and bryophyte collection.
- Includes center point equipment, compasses, tapes, calipers, augers, trowels, herbarium supplies, labels, maps, and packing materials.
- Emphasises organisation: separate bags for soil and bryophyte samples, pre-labeled forms, and dedicated boxes for site-level and plot-level data.

## Appendices and coding
- Appendix I: Instructions for collecting herbarium specimens.
- Appendix II–VI: Examples of completed forms, plot and site description instructions, soil data collection aids, and equipment checklists.
- The forms use distinct code numbers for site and plot attributes, enabling integrated data treatment while keeping forms manageable for field data entry.

## Data perspective for Analysts
- The handbook outlines a comprehensive, standardized data collection framework to enable cross-site comparisons and robust environmental analyses.
- It emphasizes data quality, traceability (through coding and herbarium vouchers), and the ability to connect plot-level data to site-level context.
- It acknowledges practical challenges (ownership access, accurate point placement, and complex soil horizons) and provides procedural mitigations and backup plans.
- Data are organized for later analysis with clear documentation of methods, horizons, and attribute definitions, facilitating consistent interpretation across sites and studies.
