# SCOTS PINE REGENERATION SURVEY

- Purpose: A vegetation survey to document Scots pine regeneration, ground flora, soil attributes, and habitat context across plots, with standardized field procedures to ensure data quality and comparability.

## Field Procedures and Plot Location

- Plot location method:
  - Use aerial photographs to locate plots.
  - After approaching the marked point, move 10 paces to the north.
  - The plot center is adjacent to the toe of the forward boot; no latitude is recorded to avoid convenience bias.
- Survey scope:
  - Vegetation, seedlings/regeneration, trees, and habitats are recorded following the Handbook, with additional seedling-specific procedures.

## Seedlings and Regeneration Data

- Seedling identification and counts:
  - While surveying the main plot, record the first 20 seedlings up to 1.3 m high for each species near the center of the plot.
  - Height criteria: pine seedlings must have leaves in pairs; birch, rowan, and other species must be > 2.5 (units in handbook) in height.
  - Note on seedling location: record which quadrat size (as defined in the plot) the 20 seedlings occurred in; seedlings are not planted exotics, and Scots pine should be recorded accordingly.
- Sampling of the first five seedlings per species:
  - For the first five seedlings of each species, place a non-seedling circular quadrat to the north and record data in the same way.
  - If fewer than five seedlings exist, place quadrats progressively at the four corners of the 25-square grid and in the plot center to bring total to five where possible.
- Circular quadrats in relation to seedlings:
  - In each quadrat, perform the following measurements:
    - Measure the height of the tallest vegetative shoot (grass flower spikes do not count).
    - Measure the height of the seedling (omit if non-seedling quadrat).
    - Record ground flora species with >5% cover.
    - Record ground cover categories.
    - Record soil attributes as defined in Handbook Appendix 5 (pages 4–5); interpret Sphagnum as moss category excluding Sphagnum cover; examine soil layers with an auger.
    - Soil sampling: collect a 10 cm soil segment from the seedling’s measured species, kept separate and labeled; bulk soil for each species.
    - Label non-seedling and other species samples accordingly; place all samples in the plot bag.
- Seedling handling:
  - Harvest remaining seedlings in the plot along with the soils and place them in the plot bag.

## Trees and Habitats

- Trees:
  - Measure all trees as described in the Handbook.
- Saplings:
  - Measure all saplings over 1.3 m tall (4'3"), not only those in quadrats.
- Habitats:
  - Complete the habitat sheet as described in the Handbook.

## Data Quality, Metadata, and Governance Considerations for Data Stewards

- Standardization and definitions:
  - Ensure alignment with Handbook definitions for plant heights, cover categories, soil attributes, and quadrat sizes.
  - Maintain consistent taxonomic nomenclature for all recorded species.
- Metadata and provenance:
  - Capture plot identifiers, location method, sampling dates, and the specific quadrat positions used (north, corners, center) for traceability.
  - Document seedling status (seedling vs non-seedling), species-specific notes, and any planted statuses (e.g., Sitka noted as planted).
- Data labeling and sample management:
  - Use clear, consistent labeling for seedling, soil, and plant samples; keep seedling and soil samples segregated by species; ensure proper bagging and labeling.
  - Track chain-of-custody from field collection to laboratory processing and storage.
- Data storage, sharing, and updates:
  - Upload datasets to the relevant data portal or catalogue with accompanying metadata and data dictionary.
  - Document all fieldwork procedures and any deviations from the Handbook; establish an update protocol to incorporate new data or corrections.
- Potential data limitations and challenges to address:
  - Incomplete user needs or missing field data can affect usability; ensure clear notation of any gaps.
  - Variability in data collection across plots (e.g., differing seedling densities, damaged plots) should be captured in metadata to aid interpretation.
  - Interoperability: ensure data formats and units are consistent to facilitate integration with other datasets.

## Endnotes

- The habitat sheet and all vegetation/seedling measurement procedures should be completed strictly as described in the Handbook.
