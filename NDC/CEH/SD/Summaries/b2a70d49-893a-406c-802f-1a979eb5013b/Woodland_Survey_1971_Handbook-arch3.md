# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose: Provides standardized field methods for identifying environmental health measures in woodlands to scrutinise policy, evaluate outcomes, and inform future decisions.
- Context: A practical survey protocol used by the Nature Conservancy and field teams to collect comparable, auditable woodland data across sites.

## Scope and aims for monitoring-context readers

- Establishes a repeatable data collection framework to generate environmental health indicators (flora, fauna, soils, habitats, and site descriptions).
- Emphasizes data quality, metadata, transparency, and the ability to share underlying data and specimen records.
- Addresses the practicalities and governance of field surveying, permissions, data handling, and outputs (forms, charts, herbarium, soil data).

## Access, permissions, and planning

- Obtain entry permission for each site; plan access to minimise travel and respect landowners’ concerns.
- Use maps (road, 1:25k and 1:50k where needed) and predefined access points to reduce disturbance and error.
- Public relations are important; explain the survey purpose clearly to owners; alternatives exist if access is refused.

## Site and sampling design

- Work from a base; survey multiple sites from the same base when efficient.
- Each site requires a full data collection workflow across plots and between-plot spaces.
- A 22" map indicates 16 sampling points per site; locating points with controlled bias and accuracy is critical.
- Location method combines control points, bearing from control to sample point, ground pacing, and slope/correction considerations.

## Locating sampling points and bias control

- Aim for accuracy within about 20 m of the true point.
- Use a systematic procedure: select next point, identify a control point, orient map with compass, pace out distance, locate on ground, and record with predetermined paces to avoid bias.
- Prioritize consistency and minimize subjective adjustments (no cherry-picking of convenient points).

## Plot layout and data collection sequence

- Center point marked with centre post; four corner posts delineate 2x2 m plots.
- Quadrats expand in increments: 2x2 m up to 10x10 m to cover a 14.14x14.14 m full plot.
- Data collection order to limit disturbance: ground flora first, then trees saplings/shrubs, then soil data; plot description and habitat data collected in parallel.

## Ground Flora (2x2 m to 14.14x14.14 m quadrats)

- Record presence/absence of all ground flora species; estimate percent cover for largest quadrat.
- Collect comprehensive bryophyte data from the full plot but do not subdivide bryophytes by quadrat size.
- Collect herbarium specimens for unidentified or rare species; label specimens and enter codes on field forms.

## Trees, saplings, and shrubs

- Trees: record species and diameter at breast height (DBH) for stems >5 cm, with separate records for multiple stems; note dead trees with a "D".
- Saplings: record trees with height <5 cm DBH in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3).
- Shrubs: same quarter recording as saplings; follow the same measurement conventions.
- Measure the height of the largest tree in the plot.

## Plot description and habitats

- Record presence/absence of defined habitat attributes within the plot (slopes, aspects, glades, logs, rocks, water bodies, etc.) following standardized attribute definitions (see Appendix IV).
- Include a ground profile sketch showing major topographic features and section line if relevant.
- Provide a concise interpretation-ready description of each plot’s habitat attributes and notable features.

## Site description and habitats (site-level)

- Complete a Site Description and Habitats form for the entire site, detailing overall site conditions, major habitat types, and landscape context.
- Include boundary features, marginal land use, and a high-level interpretation of site management influences.

## Soil data collection and interpretation

- Rationale: Large-scale survey (1648 plots) requires a limited set of physical/chemical measurements plus numerical soil description to support analysis.
- Measured properties: pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) using a simplified approach; store sub-samples for future analyses.
- Horizon-based interpretation: record soil profiles using named horizons (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C) and classify into podzolic, brown earth, calcareous, hydromorphic, skeletal types as appropriate.
- Soil description workflow:
  - Dig a small pit to expose the upper 25–30 cm; auger to probe deeper where possible.
  - Describe horizons (Aoo, Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C), depth ranges, color, texture, structure, moisture, mottling, and presence of organic material.
  - Record horizon-depth data using the from/to format to minimize cumulative error.
  - Determine underlying material and report depth limits if augering is restricted (e.g., 70 cm).
  - Collect composite soil samples (top 10–15 cm) for laboratory analyses; if sampling is difficult, note exceptions and collect from nearby within plot.
- Site-level soil typing emphasizes podzols and calcareous soils, with attention to drainage, base saturation, and vegetation influence on leaching.
- Documentation emphasizes that many profiles are immature or transitional; interpret horizons with caution.

## Data forms, coding, and management

- Site Description and Habitats Form (site level) and Plot Description and Habitats Form (plot level) are completed for each site/plot with consistent attribute coding.
- Attribute codes are documented and form a linked, paired set to enable integrated data handling across site and plot levels.
- Ensure consistency between site and plot forms; fill in all relevant attributes; address any gaps by revisiting the site or noting limitations.
- Data handling emphasizes sharing core data and specimen records where possible; organise and package field sheets, herbarium vouchers, and soil samples for shipment.

## Completion and packaging of data and samples

- After completing all forms (16 plots per site; 4 data types per plot) and site-level forms, staple forms, seal in polythene bags, and pack into labeled boxes.
- Ship parcels by post using pre-paid, pre-addressed labels; ensure samples are clearly labeled and secured.
- Equipment and samples should be checked in before leaving the site; ensure soil pits are filled or documented; avoid leaving equipment behind.

## Field equipment and workflow overview

- Standardised field equipment for plot marking, measurement, soil sampling, and specimen collection.
- Clear workflow: permission, base planning, locate sampling points, execute plot layout, collect flora/fauna/soil data, complete site/plot forms, collect herbarium specimens, sample packaging, and post-shipment.
