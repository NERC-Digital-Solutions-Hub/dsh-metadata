# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - Standardized field methods for surveying woodlands to classify habitats, monitor environmental health, and support policy evaluation over time.
  - Designed for organisations with formal monitoring responsibilities; emphasizes consistent data formats, verification, and quality assurance.
  - Data outputs intended for clear presentation (reports, maps, charts) and for storage in appropriate data portals.

- Site and sampling design
  - Each site contains an integrated set of plots (typically 16 plots per site) spanning the woodland and the intervening ground.
  - Grid-based plot layout: from small ground-flora quadrats (2 m x 2 m) up to a full-site plot of approximately 14 m x 14 m, enabling multi-scale vegetation recording.
  - Use of a site map and 22"/1 mile scale maps to locate sampling points with careful attention to minimizing bias and travel.
  - Location of sampling points aims for accuracy within a 20 m radius and avoidance of subjective placement bias.

- Permissions, access, and stakeholder relations
  - Prior permission to enter and survey sites is essential; procedures provided for cases where permission must be sought from landowners or regional authorities.
  - Emphasis on good public relations; clear explanation slips about the survey purpose; if access is denied, alternative back-up sites are available.
  - Guidance on negotiating access, recognizing landowners’ concerns (e.g., fences, privacy, game interests).

- Data collection and recording at the plot level
  - Four main data streams per site/plot:
    - (a) Ground flora presence/absence in five progressively larger quadrats, with percent cover or abundance estimates for the largest quadrat; comprehensive bryophyte collection from vascular-plant plots.
    - (b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs: diameter at breast height (for trees >5 cm DBH), height of the largest tree, and regeneration status, with explicit rules for where within the plot to record.
    - (c) Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of defined habitat attributes; detailed attribute definitions in accompanying appendices.
    - (d) Soil data: small soil pit and auger cores at the centre; composite topsoil sample (10–15 cm) plus horizon-level observations.
  - Plot layout procedure: a centre post with a right-angle orientation device; corner poles mark successive nested plots (2x2 m up to 10x10 m and beyond to 14x14 m); markers define half-diagonals for additional subplots.
  - Data handling: each plot generates four data sheets (one per data type) and two sample series; forms are stored with a site code and a plot code to enable consistent data punching and archival.

- Ground flora, trees, and habitat data details
  - Ground flora: identify all vascular plants and bryophytes; identify species using field codes with herbarium references; bryophytes primarily collected as a comprehensive soil/plant herbarium.
  - Trees, saplings, shrubs: measurements and species recorded by plot quarter (trees >5 cm DBH; saplings <5 cm DBH and height <some threshold; shrubs limited to diagonally opposite plot quarters).
  - Habitat and plot descriptors: standardized attributes (e.g., slope, aspect, major habitat types, glades, coppice, deadwood, rock features) with explicit definitions and interpretation guidance in appendices.
  - Site-level habitat: broader site description and habitat forms capture the overall habitat mosaic, boundary types, marginal land use, and human influences.

- Soil data and interpretation
  - Soil sampling protocol: small pit at plot center plus auger cores to determine horizon profiles; composite top 10–15 cm sample collected; basic soil characterization includes pH and Loss on Ignition, and a simplified mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) on dried sub-samples.
  - Pedological interpretation: horizon-by-horizon recording using a horizon nomenclature (A0, A1, A2, B1, B2, C) with guidance on organic/mineral mixing, eluviation, gleying, and underlying materials.
  - Horizon attributes (textures, colours, moisture, structure, etc.) are recorded for each horizon present; depth to horizons is measured as from-to values to minimize cumulative scaling errors.
  - Practical notes: many British soils are immature podzols or calcareous variants; the form emphasizes a numerical description approach that supports later analytical processing and cross-site comparisons.

- Data management, forms, and coding
  - Site Description and Habitats Form and Plot Description and Habitats Form provide structured, code-based data capture for cross-site comparability.
  - Attribute codes are pre-defined; site code precedes plot code on forms to facilitate data handling; two separate but compatible code series for site and plot sections (with cross-referencing).
  - Tissue collection and herbarium handling: require type specimens for species observed; specimens are labeled and stored with accompanying field codes for later verification.
  - Data submission: forms, herbarium specimens, and soil samples are boxed and shipped (with pre-paid postage) to the central repository; emphasis on completeness and accuracy to preserve long-term data integrity.

- Equipment and field logistics
  - Field equipment kit covers plotting gear (centre pole, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings), compasses, tapes (30 m and 2 m), markers, mats for herbarium, soil sampling tools (mattock, trowel, auger), and labeling supplies.
  - Fieldwork supports data integrity and repeatability; checklists ensure no equipment or samples are left behind; standardized handling of soil and bryophyte samples.

- Appendices and training resources
  - Appendix I: instructions for collecting herbarium specimens.
  - Appendix II–VI: examples of completed forms, plot descriptions, soil data forms, and equipment checklists.
  - Detailed guidance for identifying and preserving botanical specimens to minimize misidentification risk.

- Outputs and long-term value
  - Data are designed for longitudinal environmental assessment, enabling scrutiny of woodland health and policy performance over time.
  - The standardized data structure and accompanying habitat/soil interpretation frameworks facilitate data integration, meta-analysis, and potential cross-dataset linkage.
  - Aimed at increasing dataset value through consistent, repeatable collection and by enabling access to underlying data for broader analysis and reuse.
