# Summary

## Overview
- A field handbook (1971) detailing a standardized woodland survey method designed to classify woodlands, document habitats, and collect data across multiple plots per site.
- Aims to support data collection that can be combined, analysed, and used to create data products for broader exploration.
- Emphasizes planning, permissions, data quality, and consistent data formats to enable cross-site analysis.

## Survey Planning and Access
- Prepare a site survey plan to minimize travel while accommodating access constraints; surveys may be done from a common base when possible.
- Advance access information provided; permission may be regional or owner-specific. If permission is refused, back-up sites are available.
- Emphasizes good public relations; explain purpose clearly to landowners to avoid misperceptions about land purchase or compulsory powers.
- If permission cannot be obtained, request site data (maps, sampling points) from Merlewood to proceed with back-up locations.

## Sampling Design and Location of Sampling Points
- Each site has a 22" Ordnance Survey map with 16 sampling points (1–16) marked; locating points ground-truthing is critical.
- Location method prioritizes accuracy and, crucially, lack of subjective bias in point placement.
- Ground-truthing procedure:
  - Pick next sampling point, identify a nearby accurate control point (intersection, wall, etc.).
  - Orient map and compass; account for magnetic variation.
  - Use the scale on the compass to estimate ground distance; locate the control point on ground and pace to the sample point.
  - Apply small slope corrections if needed and maintain predetermined pace counts.
  - Stay consistent and avoid deviations due to obstacles (e.g., nettles, brambles).

## Data Collection and Recording Order
- For each sampling point, collect four data sets and two sample series:
  - Ground flora presence/absence across five increasing quadrat sizes with % cover estimates for the largest quadrat; collect comprehensive bryophyte data from the full plot.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: diameter at breast height (DBH) for trees >5 cm; saplings/shrubs recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) with height and DBH data; note dead trees.
  - Plot description and habitat data: presence/absence of habitat attributes, with detailed attribute definitions in Appendix IV.
  - Soil data: small pit and auger borings at plot center; composite soil sample from the top 10–15 cm; soil description and horizon data captured.
- Data collection should follow a specific order to reduce disturbance and ensure consistency (ground flora before more disturbance-prone measurements).

## Plot Layout and Measurement Procedures
- Plot design uses a centre point with a right-angle gauge; corner posts extend to delineate 2×2 m, 4×4 m, up to 10×10 m plots.
- For ground flora, search each quadrat size sequentially; record species names (field codes acceptable) under each quadrat size; bryophytes collected separately due to identification challenges.
- For ground flora, estimate total cover with 100 strikes across the plot; record presence/absence and cover for vascular plants and bryophytes as appropriate.
- For trees and saplings, measure DBH for trees >5 cm; saplings/herbs recorded in diagonally opposite quarters; note live vs dead status.
- Soil description uses a horizon-by-horizon approach (Ao, A0/A1/A2, B1/B2, C) with horizon depth (to/from cm), texture, color, structure, moisture, and other attributes; a compressed yet comprehensive soil interpretation scheme is used to support later analysis.
- Site Description and Habitats form captures site-scale attributes and a narrative of habitat features; a separate, but parallel, site form records the overall site characteristics.

## Site Description and Habitats
- Completion of a Site Description and Habitats form for each site; a Plot Description and Habitat Form (smaller, aligned with the site form) is completed for each plot.
- Attributes cover categories such as slope, aspect, hydrology, vegetation forms (glades, groves, bracken, hedges), rocks and soils, aquatic habitats, human-made features, and animal/bird/macrofungi indicators.
- A standardized code system is used to ensure consistent data entry across forms (site code, plot code, etc.).

## Soil Data: Methods and Interpretation
- A limited, field-friendly soil analysis suite is used (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis: sand/silt/clay percentages).
- Samples are preserved for later lab analyses if needed.
- Soil profiles are described horizon-by-horizon (Ao, Ai, A2, B1, B2, C) with criteria for identifying humus types (Mull, Moder, MOR), transitive horizons, gleying, texture, structure, color, moisture, and presence of organic material.
- The method emphasizes horizon depth measurement as from/to values to minimize cumulative errors.
- The underlying material is noted when present, with guidance on when auger depth limits affect horizon delineation.

## Documentation, Data Quality, and Packaging
- Each site requires 4 data sheets per plot and 2 soil/bryophyte sample sets; sheets are stapled and packed into containers for shipment.
- A data integrity emphasis: ensure site/plot numbers are recorded correctly; verify completeness; pack and label soil and bryophyte samples securely; pre-paid shipping is used for prompt data delivery.
- The approach values comprehensiveness and accuracy, even if it requires extra time.

## Herbarium and Specimen Management
- Instructions emphasize obtaining type specimens for all species encountered; field codes should be reconciled with herbarium identifications.
- Each specimen is labeled with the correct scientific name (or field code), and prepared for later verification.

## Equipment and Field Logistics
- Detailed lists of field equipment, including plotting gear, compasses, tapes, herbarium supplies, label sticks, and sample bags.
- There are two haversacks for field data collection and specimen handling, plus site bags and a field equipment checklist.

## Appendices and Data Codes
- Appendix I: Herbarium specimen collection instructions.
- Appendix II–VI: Examples of completed forms, plotting layouts, and equipment checklists.
- The data framework relies on standardized codes for attributes, site/plot numbers, and habitat types to enable cross-site data integration and subsequent statistical analyses.

## Enduring Data Utility
- The handbook envisions a large-scale dataset (e.g., 1648 plots across sites) enabling woodland classification, habitat mapping, and long-term ecological analysis.
- The emphasis on standardized forms, horizons-based soil data, and explicit attribute codes supports robust data punching, aggregation, and interpretation for conservation and management purposes.
