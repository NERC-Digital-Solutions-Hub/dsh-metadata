# SCOTS PINE REGENERATION SURVEY

- Purpose and scope
  - A field protocol to assess regeneration, vegetation structure, ground flora, soils, and habitat conditions for Scots pine.
  - Includes detailed procedures for locating plots, sampling seedlings, measuring trees, and recording habitat information.

- Plot layout and site selection
  - Plot layout follows the Handbook exactly; plots are located using aerial photographs.
  - After approaching the marked point, move 10 paces to the north.
  - No latitude marking is allowed to avoid bias; center is near the toe of the forward boot.
  - Aim to ensure the plot center is not chosen for convenience.

- Vegetation and seedling measurements
  - Seedlings and regeneration:
    - While surveying the main plot, record the first 20 seedlings up to 1.3 m tall, nearest to the plot center.
    - For each species, note whether these include planted pine seedlings; Scots should be recorded as such.
    - Pine seedlings should have leaves in pairs; birch, rowan, and other species must be over about 2.5 cm (1") in height.
    - Note the quadrat size in which each of the 20 seedlings occurred.

- Seedling sampling details (Sitka and general sampling)
  - After locating seedlings, place a circular quadrat over the first five specimens of each species nearest the plot center.
  - If fewer than five seedlings of a species are present, use non-seedling quadrats to supplement to five.
  - Non-seedling quadrats should be placed north and then progressively at the four corners of the 25-square area and in the center (if no seedlings exist).

- Quadrat procedures (for each circular quadrat)
  - 1) Measure the height of the tallest vegetative shoot (grass flower spikes do not count).
  - 2) Measure the seedling height (omit if in non-seedling quadrat).
  - 3) Record ground flora species with more than 5% cover.
  - 4) Record ground cover categories.
  - 5) Record soil attributes (definitions provided in Handbook Appendix 5, pp. 4–5); soil layers examined with an auger.
  - The soil sample should consist of a section of the top 10 cm from each measured species, kept separate and bulked per species; non-seedlings labeled with provided labels; any other species labeled separately and bagged.

- Handling of remaining material
  - Remaining seedlings in the area are harvested and placed with the soils into the plot bag.

- Tree measurements
  - All trees are to be measured as described in the Handbook.
  - All saplings over 1.3 m (4'3") should be measured, not only those within quadrats.

- Habitat data collection
  - Complete the habitat sheet as described in the Handbook.

- Data management and governance considerations
  - The protocol implies the need for clear metadata, consistent measurement standards, and appropriate data sharing.
  - Accessibility and timely availability of plots, species identification, and soil data should be supported to enable verification and reuse.
  - Data should be quality assured, properly labeled, and stored to facilitate future analyses and policy evaluation.
