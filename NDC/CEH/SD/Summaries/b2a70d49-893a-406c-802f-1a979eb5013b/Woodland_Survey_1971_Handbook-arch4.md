# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- A comprehensive guide outlining standardized field methods for surveying and classifying woodlands, including data collection, plotting layouts, soil analysis, herbarium collection, and data management practices.

## Purpose and Scope
- Establishes an outline of operations for surveying woods to support conservation and classification efforts.
- Provides procedures for data collection across ground flora, trees and saplings, plot descriptions, habitats, and soils.
- Aims to ensure consistent, comparable data across sites and over time.

## Access and Permissions
- Emphasizes obtaining permission to enter and survey each site.
- Outlines approaches for handling owner refusals and locating alternative backup sites.
- Highlights the importance of good public relations and clear communication about the survey’s purpose (not a purchase or compulsory acquisition).

## Survey Planning and Site Selection
- Recommends preparing an outline plan to minimize travel while accommodating access constraints.
- Suggests surveying multiple sites from a common base when efficient.
- Requires coordination with Regional Staff and Merlewood for access permissions and site information.

## Locating Sampling Points
- Each site map includes 16 random sample points (on a 22" map, 1 mile scale) critical for unbiased data.
- Location accuracy target: within a 20 m radius of the true point.
- Step-by-step procedure for locating points:
  - Choose the next sampling point (not necessarily in numerical order).
  - Identify a ground control point (e.g., road intersection).
  - Orient map and compass, apply magnetic variation, and pace out the distance.
  - Use a control point at the same slope level when possible and maintain predetermined pace counts.
- Emphasizes avoiding subjective bias and minimizing disturbance to terrain.

## Recording Data: Order and Structure
- Data collection is organized into four primary data sets per site and two sample sets per plot:
  - (a) Ground flora presence/absence and % cover across five quadrat sizes; comprehensive bryophyte collection from the full plot.
  - (b) Trees (>5 cm DBH), saplings, and shrubs; species and measurements across plot quadrants.
  - (c) Plot description and habitat data (presence/absence of defined attributes).
  - (d) Soil data from a central pit and auger borings; composite topsoil sample.
- The data collection sequence prioritizes ground flora first to minimize disturbance, followed by trees/saplings, soil, and then plot description.

## Ground Flora, Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs
- Ground Flora:
  - Use a central point and 2x2 m to 14x14 m nested quadrats; record all ground flora species and vascular plants, including seedlings <25 cm.
  - Bryophytes are collected comprehensively from the plot (not per quadrat) and placed in labeled bags for herbarium reference.
  - Estimate cover and abundance for all species across the full plot; convert into a standardized percentage for reporting.
- Trees, Saplings, Shrubs:
  - Record trees >5 cm DBH with species and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), including dead trees.
  - Saplings and shrubs are recorded only in diagonally opposite quadrants (1 and 3) with measured height and DBH where applicable.
  - Measure the tallest tree’s height within the plot using a provided height instrument.
- Plot Layout:
  - The plotting system uses a central point, right-angle gauge, corner posts, and distance strings to delineate 2x2 m, 4x4 m, up to 10x10 m plots.
  - A corresponding arrangement of markers allows efficient searching for species within progressively larger plots.

## Plot Description and Habitats
- For each 14.14 x 14.14 m plot, record habitat attributes (presence/absence) using detailed attribute definitions (Appendix IV).
- Includes slope, aspect, ground features, and a ground profile sketch to capture topography.
- A separate, reduced-site form captures site-wide habitat attributes.

## Soil Data: Collection and Interpretation
- Collects a limited set of physical/chemical soil measurements for efficiency across 1648 plots:
  - pH, Loss on Ignition, and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay).
  - Composite top 10–15 cm soil sample per plot; up to ~700–800 g if possible.
- Soils are interpreted using horizon-based descriptions (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) to categorize major woodland soil types (Podzolic, Brown Earth, etc.), including calcareous soils.
- Soil profile interpretation involves constructing horizons with depth (from-to), moisture state, color, texture, structure, and presence of organic layers; records a single set of horizon interpretations per plot.
- Depth measurements and horizon transitions are recorded with emphasis on avoiding cumulative errors and noting if horizons are not clearly defined.
- When bedrock or underlying material limits auger depth, bracket notes are added to indicate limitations.

## Site Description and Habitats (Site-Level)
- A separate site description form records site-wide conditions and the relation of plots to one another.
- Documents marginal land use, boundary types, and overall impression of the site.
- Provides a consolidated, holistic view of the site’s ecological context beyond individual plots.

## Completion, Packaging, and Dispatch
- After data collection, forms are checked for completeness and consistency.
- Samples (soil, bryophyte, herbarium specimens) are organized into labeled containers and dispatched in pre-paid, pre-addressed parcels.
- Emphasizes thorough reporting so data remains usable for future analyses and data archiving.

## Herbarium Collection
- Aimed at collecting type specimens for all species encountered; prioritize specimens with adequate morphological detail (flowering shoots preferred).
- Each specimen is labeled with the field name and code; includes careful recording of synonyms and IDs to avoid misidentification.
- Sets of prepared herbarium sheets and recording data accompany soil and plot data.

## Equipment and Logistics
- Detailed lists of field equipment required for plotting, sampling, and specimen handling.
- Includes two haversacks with field sheets, compasses, tapes, hooks, and labeling supplies.
- Emphasizes the need for careful packing and transport of samples to maintain sample integrity.

## Data Standards, Codes, and Forms
- Uses standardized forms for Site Description and Habitat, Plot Description and Habitat, and separate soil data forms.
- Attributes and codes are structured to ensure consistency across sites and enable efficient data entry and punching.
- The document provides example forms and guidance for ensuring logical consistency between plot and site records.

## Management and Interpretation
- Provides guidance on interpreting woodland management history (e.g., planted woods, coppice origins, stumps) to aid in identifying management history from field data.
- Includes detailed attribute codes for various habitat types, flora and fauna indicators, and anthropogenic features.

## Appendices and Field Equipment
- Appendices include equipment checklists, herbarium instructions, and example completed forms.
- Offers explicit methods for constructing sampling layouts, collecting and recording data, and preparing specimens for submission.

This handbook serves as a comprehensive, standardized protocol for national woodland surveys, ensuring systematic data collection, consistent coding, careful site management, and robust data for comparative woodland classification and conservation planning.
