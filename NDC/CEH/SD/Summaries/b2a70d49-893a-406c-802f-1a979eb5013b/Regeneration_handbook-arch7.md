# SCOTS PINE REGENERATION SURVEY

## Purpose and GIS Relevance
- Provides map-based, spatially referenced data on Scots pine regeneration and associated vegetation.
- Data collected include plot locations, quadrat positions, seedling inventories, ground flora, soil attributes, and tree measurements, enabling GIS mapping and spatial analysis of regeneration patterns.
- Emphasizes standardized procedures, data labeling, and careful QA to support integration across plots and datasets.

## Plot Location and Layout
- Plot layout is defined by aerial photographs; actual plots are located by fitting near the marked point on the photos and then taking 10 paces north.
- The plot centre is selected to avoid convenience bias (no latitude is recorded; location is relative to the marked point and direction).
- The survey uses a 25-square plot framework with sampling positioned at the center and four corners.

## Vegetation Survey and Seedlings
- Within the main plot, record the first 20 seedlings (up to 1.3 m height) nearest the plot centre for each species; note height thresholds by species (e.g., pine seedlings with paired leaves; birch/rowan seedlings above a specified height).
- Record which quadrat size the 20 seedlings occurred in on the vegetation sheet.
- Seedlings that are not exotics should be identified as Scots pine if applicable.

## Seedling Sampling and Quadrat Placement
- After locating seedlings, place a circular quadrat over the first five specimens of each species nearest the centre. If fewer than five seedlings exist for a species, use a non-seedling quadrat to reach five samples.
- Quadrat placement strategy: distribute samples across the four corners of the 25-square plot and the centre (or, if no seedlings exist, place accordingly to achieve five samples per species).

## Quadrat Measurements (per species/ Quadrat)
- Measure the height of the tallest vegetative shoot in the quadrat (grass flowering shoots do not count as tallest).
- Measure seedling height (omit this step in non-seedling quadrats).
- Record ground flora species with >5% cover.
- Record ground cover categories (as defined in the Handbook).
- Record soil attributes (definitions are in Handbook Appendix 5 P.4-5); distinguish Sphagnum, moss species (excluding Sphagnum), and other relevant ground cover.
- Examine soil layers with an auger; collect soil samples:
  - Seedling species: keep the 10 cm soil section from each measured seedling separate, then bulk by species.
  - Non-seedling samples: label and bag separately; other species labeled in a separate bag.
- Harvest remaining seedlings in the quadrat area, along with soils, and place them in the plot bag.

## Trees and Saplings
- Measure all trees as described in the Handbook.
- Measure saplings over 1.3 m (4'3") height, not only those in quadrats.

## Habitats
- Complete the habitat sheet as described in the Handbook.

## Sitka and Species Notes
- Sitka may be recorded as planted (Sitka (1) Planted) in the context of the plot and species composition.

## Data Management and Labeling
- All samples are labeled and bagged according to the Handbook instructions.
- Seedling, non-seedling, soil, and species data are kept separate and clearly identified to enable GIS-based attribute linkage.

## GIS Considerations and Data Integration
- Spatial data constraints: absence of latitude means reliance on relative plot positioning and aerial imagery for GIS mapping; consistency of plot centre reference is crucial for reproducible mapping.
- Data produced are multi-source (vegetation, seedlings, soils, habitats, trees) and require careful standardization to enable integration across plots.
- The protocol supports map-based visualization of regeneration patterns, species distribution, and soil-vegetation relationships at the plot level.

## Notes
- The procedure references a Handbook and Appendix for specific definitions and methods; adherence ensures compatibility with GIS data schemas and downstream analyses.
