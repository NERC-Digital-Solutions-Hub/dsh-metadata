# SCOTS PINE REGENERATION SURVEY

- Purpose and scope: Field survey of Scots pine regeneration with vegetation, seedlings, and habitat assessment following the Handbook, plus additional procedures to capture regeneration data more comprehensively.

## Plot location and survey approach

- Plot layout remains as specified, but plots must be located using the provided aerial photographs.
- From the marked point on the aerial photo, approach to as close as possible and then take 10 paces to the north.
- The plot center should be near the toe of the forward boot; no latitude-based centralization to prevent bias.
- Ground flora survey conducted as in the Handbook, with the following additions.

## Seedlings and regeneration sampling

- While surveying the main plot for species, record the first 20 seedlings of each species that are up to about 1.3 m tall nearest the plot centre (specific height thresholds for certain species noted in the protocol).
- For each species, note the quadrat size where the 20 seedlings occurred and count how many seedlings are found in each quadrat size.
- Seedlings are not considered exotics; Scots pine seedlings should be recorded as such on the vegetation sheet (and marked with relevant notes, e.g., pine).
- Sitka (Sitka spruce) seedlings are recorded as planted.
- After locating seedlings, use circular quadrats over the first five specimens of each species nearest the plot centre. If fewer than five seedlings are present, sample only those seedlings.
  - If fewer than five, supplement up to five by placing non-seedling quadrats progressively at the four corners of the 25-square area and the centre (if no seedlings are present at all).
- Quadrat procedure (for each sampled area):
  1. Measure the height of the tallest vegetative shoot in the quadrat (grass flower spikes do not count).
  2. Measure the seedling height (omit in non-seedling quadrats).
  3. Record ground flora species with cover above the specified threshold.
  4. Record ground cover categories.
  5. Record soil attributes using definitions from Handbook Appendix 5 (pages referenced). Distinguish Sphagnum; moss category refers to species other than Sphagnum and excludes Sphagnum cover. Examine soil layers with an auger; collect soil samples comprising the 10 cm depth from each measured seedling’s species (kept separate) and bulk for each species; label non-seedlings and other species separately.
- Remaining seedlings within the area are harvested and, together with the soils, bagged for transport.

## Trees

- All trees measured as described in the Handbook.
- saplings over 4 ft 3 in (1.3 m) should be measured, rather than only those within quadrants.

## Habitats

- Complete the habitat sheet as described in the Handbook.

## Data management and quality considerations (implications for Data Leaders)

- Standardization: Ensure consistent adherence to the Handbook definitions (soil attributes, cover thresholds, species labeling) across plots and observers.
- Metadata and provenance: Record plot ID, location method, date, observer, and any deviations from the protocol to maintain traceability.
- Data granularity and structure: Capture per-species seedling counts, heights, quadrat locations, soil samples per species, and habitat classifications to enable multi-use data products.
- Data quality challenges: Verifications of species, height measurements, and soil attributes; separating seedling vs non-seedling quadrats; ensuring proper labeling and bagging of samples; handling scattered data due to variable seedling presence.
- Access and reuse: Data products should support replication, cross-site comparison, and potential integration with wider vegetation datasets or regeneration monitoring programs.
