# SCOTS PINE REGENERATION SURVEY

- Purpose and scope
  - Field protocol to survey Scots pine regeneration and associated vegetation.
  - Uses aerial photographs to locate plots; aims for standardized, auditable data collection.
  - Centers plots in a way that avoids selection by convenience; requires clear documentation of location approach.

- Plot setup and location
  - Plot layout is as described in the Handbook, but plots are relocated to match features visible on aerial photographs.
  - Location method: approach a marked point on the aerial image, then take 10 paces north to determine the plot centre.
  - No latitude coordinate is recorded; emphasis on consistent centre placement to prevent bias.

- Vegetation and data collection framework
  - Vegetation survey follows Handbook procedures with added site-specific steps for regeneration assessment.
  - Ground flora and soil attributes are recorded within the established sampling framework.
  - Seedling regeneration is tracked for multiple species across the plot.

- Seedlings and regeneration sampling
  - For each species present within the main plot, record the first 20 seedlings up to 1.3 m tall (height thresholds vary by species; e.g., pine, birch, rowan, and other species have specified height criteria).
  - Note the quadrat size where the seedling count occurs on the vegetation sheet; mark pine as planted/native as applicable.
  - After locating seedlings, place a circular quadrat over the first five specimens of each species nearest the plot centre. If fewer than five seedlings exist for a species, add non-seedling quadrats to reach five specimens.
  - Quadrats are positioned progressively at the four corners of the 25-square layout and in the centre (or as needed if seedlings are scarce).

- Quadrat procedures and measurements
  - In each circular quadrat:
    - Measure the height of the tallest vegetative shoot (grass flowering stems do not count as vegetative shoots).
    - Measure the height of the seedlings (exclude if non-seedling quadrat).
    - Record ground flora species with more than a specified cover threshold (e.g., >5% 또는 5–?% cover as per Handbook).
    - Record ground cover categories and soil attributes (definitions provided in Handbook Appendix 5, pages 4–5).
    - Assess soil layers with an auger; collect soil samples consisting of a 10 cm section around each measured seedling species, keeping samples for each species separate; label non-seedling specimens appropriately and bag accordingly.
  - Remaining seedlings in the plot, along with soils, are harvested and placed into the plot bag for later processing.

- Sitka/Spruce and planted stands
  - Sitka (likely Sitka spruce) plantations are treated as planted material; sampling considerations differentiate planted vs. natural regeneration.

- Trees and saplings
  - All trees are measured per Handbook instructions; saplings over 1.3 m (4'3") are measured, extending beyond the quadrant sampling to ensure comprehensive growth assessment.

- Habitat assessment
  - The habitat sheet is completed following the described protocol to classify or describe habitat features relevant to regeneration.

- Data handling and quality considerations for Data Support
  - Data are collected across plots, species, seedling counts, heights, ground cover, soil attributes, and habitat classifications.
  - Structured recording is necessary to enable self-serve data exploration (dashboards, pivot analyses, and reports).
  - Potential data challenges include: aligning complex, multi-species seedling data with precise location (no latitude), ensuring consistent height and cover measurements across field teams, and maintaining clear sample labeling for soil and plant material.
  - Outputs likely include: vegetation sheets, per-quadrat and per-species regeneration counts, height distributions, soil attribute summaries, and habitat classifications, all suitable for dashboards and summarized reports.
