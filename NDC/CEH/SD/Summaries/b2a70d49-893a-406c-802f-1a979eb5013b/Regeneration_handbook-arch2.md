# SCOTS PINE REGENERATION SURVEY

## Overview
- Field procedure to assess Scots pine regeneration using standardized plots.
- Data collected cover seedling counts, heights, species, ground flora, soil attributes, and tree measurements.
- Aimed at enabling consistent monitoring of regeneration status over time.

## Plot Layout and Positioning
- Plots are located using aerial photographs provided; exact positioning follows a specified method.
- After approaching the marked point on the photo, take 10 paces to the north.
- Plot centre is defined to avoid convenience sampling; no latitude is recorded.
- Ground flora survey proceeds as per the Handbook with these additional positioning procedures.

## Seedlings and Regeneration
- During the main plot walk, record the first 20 seedlings of each species up to about 1.3 m in height (nearest to the plot centre) using provided pins.
- Pine seedlings must have leaves in pairs; birch, rowan, and other species should be over about 2.5 units in height.
- Note on the vegetation sheet which quadrat size the 20 seedlings occur in and how many seedlings are found per quadrat size.

## Sitka and Plantings
- Note Sitka (spruce) planted status where applicable.
- After locating seedlings, proceed to sampling the first five specimens of each species nearest the plot centre using circular quadrats. If fewer than five seedlings are present, sample only those.
- To reach five samples when needed, place non-seedling quadrats progressively at the four corners of the 25-square area and at the centre (if no seedlings exist).

## Quadrat-Based Assessments
For each circular quadrat (testing the first five specimens per species or the available seedlings):
- Measure the height of the tallest vegetative shoot (flower spikes of grasses do not count).
- Measure the height of the seedling (omit if non-seedling quadrat).
- Record ground flora species with over 5% cover.
- Record ground cover categories.
- Record soil attributes (definitions in Handbook Appendix 5, pages 4–5). Distinguish Sphagnum and other moss categories; examine soil layers with an auger.
- Soil samples: collect a section from the 10 cm depth for each measured species, kept separate by species, and bulked for each species. Non-seedlings labeled with provided labels; other species labeled separately; all samples bagged.

## Harvesting and Sampling Completion
- The remaining seedlings in the area are harvested and the soils are placed with the plot in the bag.

## Trees
- All trees are to be measured following the Handbook, with the exception that all saplings over 1.3 m (4'3") should be measured, not just those within quadrants.

## Habitats
- Complete the habitat sheet as described in the Handbook.
