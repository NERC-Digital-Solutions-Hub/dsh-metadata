# Scottish Pinewood regeneration survey, 1973 Dataset Summary

- A follow-up study to the 1971 Scottish Pinewood Survey, examining regeneration in seven Scottish pinewoods using a denser field sampling approach.
- Total of 419 plots of 200 m² surveyed across seven woods between July and August 1973.
- Data collected cover trees, saplings & shrubs; vascular plants; bryophytes (Abernethy only); regeneration metrics; habitat and soil characteristics.

## Aim

- Assess regeneration in selected woods from the 1971 survey to understand regeneration status and habitat/soil associations.
- Produce standardized, comparable data on vegetation, regeneration, and habitat conditions for environmental health and policy monitoring.

## Coverage and Design

- Geographic coverage: seven native pinewoods in Scotland.
- Time period: field data collected in 1973 (approximate start dates range across July–August 1973).
- Sample design: from 27 woods in the 1971 survey, seven were re-surveyed with more plots per wood to characterize regeneration.
- Plot allocation: 419 plots of 200 m² distributed across the seven woods; plots nested within sites (woodlands grouped into Eastern, South Western, Central, North Western groups, etc.).
- Site descriptions and plot descriptions recorded; standardized methods used for habitat, vegetation, and regeneration assessments.

## Survey Methods

- Habitat data: predefined habitat categories; slope and aspect measured; site-level attributes where applicable.
- Vegetation data: nested quadrat system within each 200 m² plot; trees, saplings, and shrubs recorded; vascular plants recorded by increasing quadrat sizes; percent cover estimates recorded.
- Trees, saplings & shrubs: species, DBH, height, dead/alive status; stem grouping for coppice, tallest tree height recorded.
- Regeneration data: first 20 seedlings per species (up to 1.3 m) marked; regeneration quadrats (25 cm diameter) used to record height, seedling height, ground flora >5% cover, and soil/ground-descriptive attributes; additional soil samples taken from seedling and non-seedling quadrats.
- Soil data: top 10 cm soil samples analyzed for pH; samples taken from regenerating and non-regenerating plots.
- Data capture: field handbook and Bunce & Shaw (1973) standardized procedures guided data collection.

## Data Collected

- Habitat data: habitat types, slope, aspect; site-level traits.
- Vegetation data: trees, saplings & shrubs (DBH, height, growth form, dead indicators); vascular plants with species codes and percent cover; bryophytes (Abernethy only).
- Regeneration data: regeneration type by plot/species; seedling/height measurements; ground flora species >5% cover; soil attributes per regeneration quadrat.
- Soil data: pH across seedling and non-seedling quadrats; descriptive soil/ground categories (litter, rock/soil, water, peat, etc.).
- Ground flora: presence and percent cover of vascular plants; Bryophytes data primarily for Abernethy.
- Data outputs include both plot-level descriptions and per-species regeneration metrics.

## Data Structure and Files

- SPRS_1973_PLOT_SITE_DESCS.csv: plot and site descriptions, habitat information, survey dates, sheet identifiers.

## Site Summaries

- Seven woods: Mar, Abernethy, Barisdale, Glen Affric, Shieldaig, Loch Maree, and Tyndrum.
- Each site has plot-level records including start dates, plot descriptions, soil pH samples, ground flora presence, and regeneration data points.

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring

- Demonstrates how standardized, repeatable field methods can quantify regeneration and habitat/soil relationships over time.
- Provides a rich, multi-parameter dataset suitable for cross-time comparisons, habitat-health assessments, and policy-oriented monitoring of native pinewood regeneration.
- Highlights data management practices: structured data files, explicit field descriptions, and traceable survey methods to support transparency and reuse.
