# SCOTS PINE REGENERATION SURVEY

- Purpose and approach
  - Aimed at assessing Scots pine regeneration by following a prescribed plot-based vegetation survey with detailed seedling and soil sampling.
  - Integrates standard Handbook procedures with additional, explicit sampling steps for seedlings, quadrats, and soil.

- Plot layout and location
  - Plot layout exactly as described in the Handbook.
  - Plots located using aerial photographs: approach a marked point, then take 10 paces north.
  - Plot center placement is constrained to avoid convenience bias (no latitude-based centering).

- Seedlings and regeneration (overall approach)
  - During vegetation work, record the first 20 seedlings up to 1.3 m tall near the plot center.
  - Seedling species-specific checks:
    - Pine seedlings must have leaves in pairs.
    - Birch, rowan, and other species must exceed 2.5 (height unit specified in the protocol).
  - Note on the vegetation sheet which quad size the 20 seedlings came from and counts per seedling quadrat size.

- Quadrat sampling for seedlings
  - For the first five seedlings of each species near the center, place a circular quadrat.
  - If fewer than five seedlings are present, use a non-seedling quadrat placed to the north and recorded similarly.
  - To complete up to five, place additional quadrats progressively at the four corners of the 25-square plot and at the center (if no seedlings exist there).
  - In each quadrat, record:
    - The height of the tallest vegetative shoot (grass shoots not counted).
    - The height of the seedling (if applicable; otherwise this may be omitted).
    - Ground flora species with cover exceeding the specified threshold.
    - Ground cover categories.
    - Soil attributes (as defined in Handbook Appendix 5, pages 4–5).
    - Use an auger to examine soil layers; soil samples should be taken from the 10 cm depth section for each measured species and kept separate, then bulked per species.
  - Label and bag seedling and non-seedling samples distinctly; any other species labeled separately. Remaining seedlings in the area are harvested and placed in the plot bag with the soils.

- Sitka and planted status
  - The procedure notes Sitka seedlings and indicates their planted status as part of the sampling record.

- Trees and saplings
  - All trees measured as per the Handbook.
  - In addition, all saplings over 4 ft 3 in (1.3 m) must be measured, not just those within quadrats.

- Habitats
  - Complete the habitat sheet as described in the Handbook.

- Data handling and notes
  - Data are recorded on vegetation sheets and habitat sheets, with soil attributes and sample labeling following predefined conventions.
  - The procedure emphasizes separating samples by seedling species and ensuring traceability back to the plot and quadrat location.
