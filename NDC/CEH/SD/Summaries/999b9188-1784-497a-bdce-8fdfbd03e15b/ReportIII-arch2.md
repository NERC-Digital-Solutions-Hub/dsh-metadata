# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Purpose and Context
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive field study at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders.
- Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for various research groups and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Prescribed standardized measurements to aid links with other data and enable cross-year comparisons.
- 2001 site management impacted by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change of site Officer in Charge.

## Data Collected and Monitoring Schedule
- Automatic Weather Station data collected on-site; regular data transfer to the MLURI/CEH data manager.
- Environmental and productivity measurements by year:
  - Above-ground biomass across treatment plots with five mowing occasions per summer.
  - Soil pH measurements (upper 5 cm) to monitor liming and nitrogen effects.
  - Botanical composition through July Point Quadrat surveys and species abundance analyses.
  - Supplemental surveys (minirhizotron-related and disturbance/nutrient surveys) on specific subplots.
- Treatments include control, nitrogen addition, lime addition, nitrogen+lime, and biocide.
- Data collection occurred from 1998–2001; 2001 fieldwork partially affected by FMD restrictions.
- Data integrity checks include inter-surveyor comparison (Buckland vs another surveyor) showing no significant differences.

## Key Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline data generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after a very wet previous year.
- Radiation similar to prior years; slight drop in average temperatures; soil moisture content modestly higher than previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Clear hierarchy in biomass across treatments, with peak biomass in July/August.
- 2001 saw a substantial biomass increase relative to 2000; attributed to staff changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Biomass data normalized against the C1 (control) treatment to show persistent effects of nitrogen and lime on productivity.
- Statistical analyses indicate:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. unimproved plots.
  - A significant treatment-by-year interaction.
  - No significant differences among blocks.
- Overall, nitrogen and lime inputs most strongly promoted biomass production.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime applications continued to raise surface soil pH (5 cm depth):
  - Limed plots: average pH ~6.19.
  - Nitrogen & Lime plots: average pH ~6.38.
- Nitrogen alone also increased pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots remained close to baseline pH levels since August 1998.

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat survey showed treatment-related shifts in species abundance.
- Species changes:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 (except remaining most abundant in Control 1 and Limed plots).
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; prominent in N and Biocide plots, and in N&L plots respectively.
  - Improved pastures species (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) increased in fertilized plots, especially those with both nitrogen and lime.
  - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
- Diversity: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime plots, suggesting potential slight diversity loss in the most productive plots.
- Multivariate analysis:
  - PCA largely separates nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Biomass correlates positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines with Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
  - Increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity and Spatial Variation

### 3.1 Variation in Surface Soil pH and Plant Community
- Spatial heterogeneity detected: columns E and F show comparatively more acidic plots, influenced by plot composition (many controls/biocide plots in those columns).
- Substantial underlying spatial heterogeneity in pH across the site affects the plant community.

### 3.2 Variation in Vegetation Biomass
- Biomass distribution shows outlying plots with lower biomass across treatments, and higher biomass in plots located more centrally on the site.
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, reinforcing the link between fertility/pH and productivity.
- No significant differences in biomass across blocks.

## Management Context and Data Considerations
- 2001 Field Plan and Activities:
  - Some mowing periods affected by mechanical issues; 2001 fieldwork documented with the baseline protocol.
  - Shift to mechanical cutting contributed to higher biomass in 2001.
- Data Quality and Accessibility:
  - Data collected and managed under standardized protocols to enable inter-year comparability.
  - Weather data integrated and transmitted to the central data manager; extensive tables and figures accompany the report to facilitate cross-study linking.
  - Appendix provides annualised above-ground biomass per plot and mean across blocks.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring
- Demonstrates how standardized, multi-parameter monitoring can reveal treatment effects on productivity and plant communities over time.
- Confirms that soil fertility manipulations (lime and nitrogen) drive biomass production and shift species composition toward more productive, pasture-like assemblages.
- Highlights the importance of accounting for site heterogeneity (pH variation, spatial layout) in interpreting treatment effects.
- Provides a data-rich baseline and cross-year comparability framework relevant to environmental health monitoring, policy assessment, and data integration across studies.
- Underlines the value of documenting management disruptions (e.g., FMD restrictions) and personnel changes, as these can influence measured outcomes.
