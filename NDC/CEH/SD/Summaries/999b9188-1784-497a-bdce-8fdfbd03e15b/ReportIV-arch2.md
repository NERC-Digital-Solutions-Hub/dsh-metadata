# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

## Overview
- Four years of intensive field study at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, focusing on above-ground productivity, plant community composition, and diversity.
- Main drivers of botanical change identified: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and lime), and insecticide application (Dursban 4).
- Long-term goal: understand links between soil biodiversity, above-ground plant communities, and ecological processes.

## Site and Treatments
- Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks with randomised main plots subdivided into sub-plots.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide (formerly Biocide; Dursban 4).
- Site management: monthly mowing May–Sept to ~6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime.
- Data collection context: Phase I (1998–2001) and Phase II follow-up; field activity by multiple research groups; healthy data flow to monitoring portals.

## Data and Methods
- Data sources:
  - Automatic Weather Station (since 1999) for temperature, rainfall, and other climate variables.
  - Above-ground biomass: regular 0.5 m2 plant clippings collected before each mow, dried and weighed.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998, then 2000–2002 point analyses using 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid (hits per species).
  - Soil data: soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe) across plots/cells.
  - Bryophyte and vascular plant species lists; Appendix datasets for detailed species and biomass outputs.
- Analysis:
  - Split-plot ANOVA for biomass and year-treatment interactions.
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on point-analysis data, with treatment-based ranking.
  - Shannon Diversity Index calculations for plant communities over time.
- Structure: site includes a downslope environmental gradient; data published with extensive appendices on treatments and species.

## Key Findings (2002 and trends since 1999)
- Biomass and productivity
  - 2002: biomass production declined across several treatments relative to 2001; long-term trend shows increasing biomass since 1999, with nitrogen + lime plots most productive.
  - Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1; slope position affected productivity (down-slope blocks higher gains earlier; current year declines more pronounced upslope).
- Fertilisation effects
  - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently boost above-ground biomass; combining N + Lime yields the strongest productivity.
  - Signs of potential productivity peak in N+L plots; soil pH approached ~7.0 in limed plots; possible moisture-related stress in high-pH, drier conditions.
  - Elevated pH correlates with lower soil moisture; overall positive relationship between pH and biomass when considering all treatments, but treatment-specific patterns vary.
- Plant functional groups and community shifts
  - Functional groups tracked: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderals (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR).
  - N+L plots: C-S-R species expand; higher pH and fertility favor competitive-types (C-S-R).
  - Unfertilised plots: stress-tolerant species gain; disturbance reduction and nutrient loss via mowing shift communities toward S-type species.
  - Across years, SR/C-S-R-dominated groups decline with increased disturbance in some plots.
- Species composition and diversity
  - Point analyses show increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in improved plots; Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum dominate unimproved plots.
  - Bryophytes (mosses) proliferate across the site, especially in unimproved plots; Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus becomes more common; bryophyte share of total hits rises markedly over time.
  - Diversity (Shannon index) changes: increases in several treatments since 2000, but declines in nitrogen & lime plots by 2002; overall site-level patterns show significant treatment effects over time.
- Insecticide effects
  - Dursban 4 may influence plant diversity via reduced herbivory; evidence aligns with some prior insect-plant interaction studies, but causal links remain cautious due to lack of direct herbivory data.
- Trampling and handling effects
  - 2002 C2 plots show notable productivity reductions potentially linked to trampling during 13CO2 pulse experiments.

## Discussion: Interpretations and Implications
- Mowing effect
  - Repeated, uniform mowing reduces Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis; Festuca rubra expands, especially in fertilised plots.
  - Widespread bryophyte expansion linked to 6 cm sward height; mosses contribute more to biomass in unimproved plots; disturbance reduction favors stress-tolerant species.
- Fertilisation effect
  - Fertility improvements boost productivity; lime raises soil pH and interacts with moisture to influence growth; risk of peak productivity and potential stress from high pH if moisture is limiting.
  - N+L combination shifts communities toward competitive-stress-ruderal types; nitrogen alone less beneficial for some functional groups.
- Insecticide effect
  - Plant-herbivore interactions are complex; while reduced herbivory may boost diversity in some contexts, results are not definitive; continued monitoring needed to parse indirect effects.
- Trampling effect
  - Intensive trampling during pulses (e.g., labelled CO2 pulses) likely suppresses growth in affected plots (notably C2).
- Overall monitoring takeaway
  - Management actions have clear, measurable effects on productivity, species composition, and functional group balance.
  - The data illustrate dynamic eco-physiological responses to combined soil amendments and disturbance regimes over multiple years.

## Data Access, Portals, and Datasets
- Large datasets accumulated: >11,600 soil samples; extensive biomass, phenology, and species surveys; weather data and site activity logs.
- Results are documented with multiple appendices (species lists, treatment summaries, biomass time series, PCA loadings) and are intended for upload to research portals and shared databases.
- Encourages linking datasets across projects to enhance value and enable broader environmental health analyses.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring (Analysts’ Perspective)
- Demonstrates the value of standardised, repeatable monitoring formats to assess environmental health and policy-relevant outcomes over time.
- Highlights the importance of documenting management regimes, temporal dynamics, and functional traits to interpret ecosystem responses.
- Underlines the need for accessible underlying data to support cross-study analysis and policy scrutiny.
- Suggests opportunities to integrate above-ground monitoring with beneath-ground biodiversity datasets for holistic environmental assessments.
