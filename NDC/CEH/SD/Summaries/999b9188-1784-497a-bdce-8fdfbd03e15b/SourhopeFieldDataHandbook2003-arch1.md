# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Context and scope of the included data
- Presents multi-horizon soil and vegetation data from Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on Block 4 and Block 5, with ecotron plots as part of a long-term biodiversity and soil study.
- Data types include soil profile descriptions, laboratory analyses (N, C, C:N, base cations, moisture loss, LOI, pH in water and CaCl2), auger samples, and vegetation surveys.
- Aimed at linking soil chemistry and texture with vegetation communities to understand effects of management and environmental gradients.

## Block 4: SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG FOOT, BLOCK 4
- soil profile (0–95 cm) across horizons LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx; typical features:
  - FH: abundant very fine roots; high organic content in the surface layer.
  - Abg to C gx horizons show increasing mineral content and substantial igneous stone content (andesite).
  - C gx horizon: sandy clay loam with abundant stones; strong horizon differentiation.
- Soil description highlights:
  - Generally moist to friable soils with clear horizon boundaries.
  - Increasing coarseness and stone content with depth.

  - ABg, Bs, Cx horizons: progressively lower C and N; Ca and Mg drop in deeper horizons; pH ranges ~4.8–5.05 (H2O) and CaCl2 ~3.88–4.19; LOI declines with depth.
- Auger samples (Block 4) show horizon-wide variation in %N, %C, C:N, base cations, moisture loss, LOI, pH; patterns indicate localized variability in organic matter and mineral components.
- Vegetation survey (Block 4) indicates indicator species and community composition patterns associated with slope position and plot-level effects; dominant species and edges show spatial structure.

## Block 5: SOIL AND VEGETATION DATA, BLOCK 5
- Site details: coordinates NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; imperfect drainage; major soil subgroups described as Brown forest soil with gleying; igneous/andesitic bedrock.
- Soil profile (0–100 cm) across horizons LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg:
  - FH and H horizons show high organic content early on, with substantial iron/stone content descending through ABg and Bg horizons.
  - Deep Cg horizon shows abundant igneous stones; horizon BCg and Bg display mottling and clear horizon boundaries.
- Soil analytics (representative Block 5 horizons):
  - FH: %N ≈ 2.05; %C ≈ 33.81; C:N ≈ 16.46; Ca ≈ 11.91; Mg ≈ 5.92; K ≈ 3.30; LOI ≈ 67.00%; pH H2O ≈ 4.66; pH CaCl2 ≈ 4.48; Moisture loss ≈ 8.16%.
  - H: %N ≈ 2.17; %C ≈ 31.06; C:N ≈ 14.31; Ca ≈ 12.54; Mg ≈ 5.50; K ≈ 1.50; LOI ≈ 59.64%; pH H2O ≈ 5.20; pH CaCl2 ≈ 3.88; Moisture loss ≈ 9.43%.
  - Ah: %N ≈ 0.65; %C ≈ 9.36; C:N ≈ 14.36; Ca ≈ 2.38; Mg ≈ 1.52; K ≈ 0.59; LOI ≈ 19.27%; pH H2O ≈ 4.34; pH CaCl2 ≈ 3.88; Moisture loss ≈ 5.42%.
  - AB, Bg, BCg, Cg horizons show progressively lower C and N, with Ca generally decreasing to low meq/100g values; pH H2O ~4.4–4.9; pH CaCl2 ~3.6–4.0; LOI declines to single digits in Bg/BCg/Cg.
- Auger samples (Block 5) provide horizon-specific data:
  - Across horizons 5A–5F: %N typically 0.5–0.6 in upper horizons, C around 7–9%; C:N ratios ~12–14; Ca around 2.5–5 meq/100g; Mg around 1.5–3.5; LOI around 15–18%; pH H2O ~4.5–4.9; pH CaCl2 ~3.5–4.0.
- Vegetation survey (Block 5) shows plot-by-plot totals for species presence and abundance; patterns indicate diverse herbaceous and bryophyte assemblages with variation among subplots and blocks.

## ECOTRON SOIL SITE
- Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT): Wt ≈ 6.09 mg; %N ≈ 0.59; %C ≈ 8.22; C:N ≈ 13.83; Ca ≈ 2.76; Mg ≈ 1.70; K ≈ 0.62; Na ≈ 0.15; %Moisture loss ≈ 4.79; %LOI ≈ 17.42; pH H2O ≈ 4.79; pH CaCl2 ≈ 3.82.
- Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT): data structured by subplots A–F with counts of dominant and subordinate species; indicates community composition varying across the controlled environment plot.

## Endnotes on data organization and purpose
- The data are organized to support multivariate analyses of vegetation–soil relationships, including nutrient status, organic matter, and pH gradients across horizons and slope positions.
- Archiving and metadata practices are in place to enable discoverability and reuse for identifying correlations, patterns, and potential predictive relationships between management actions and ecological outcomes.
- Overall objective remains to inform how soil chemistry, texture, and disturbance interact with biodiversity and ecosystem processes under different management scenarios.
