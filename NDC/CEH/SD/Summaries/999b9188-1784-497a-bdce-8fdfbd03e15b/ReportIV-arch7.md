NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

# Overview
- Four years of intensive botanical and productivity monitoring at Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders.
- Focus on above-ground biomass production (productivity), species composition, and diversity under five treatments plus controls.
- Treatments: Control 1, Control 2 (unmanipulated), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4). Mowing applied site-wide.
- Experimental layout: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block; 10 sub-plots per main plot; 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells assigned to research groups.
- Timeline highlights: fencing in 1998 to exclude grazing; mowing to ~6 cm since 1999; fertiliser and lime applied in spring; insecticide applied after mowing.
- Data collected: weather data from on-site automatic station; above-ground biomass from 0.5 m2 cells; periodic baseline and follow-up botanical surveys using point quadrats; soil pH and moisture; bryophyte and epiphytic surveys; 1999–2002 data waves with multi-year analyses.

# Methods (Incorporating Site Activity)
- Site management: monthly mowing May–Sept to ~6 cm; insecticide plots treated post-mowing; nutrient additions (N and/or lime) in designated plots.
- Data collection: 
  - Weather: on-site station since 1999.
  - Productivity: regular clipping of 0.5 m2 cells, dried and weighed since 1999.
  - Vegetation surveys: baseline (1998) with 25-point quadrats; annual July/August point analyses (2000–2002) using 100-hole frame in a 0.5 m2 cell per sub-plot; bryophyte identification in 2002; supplementary vegetation cover and biomass sampling as needed.
  - Soil: pH measurements since 1998; soil moisture via theta probe in 2002; additional soil sampling for various projects.
- Research activity: Phase I projects largely completed by 2002; Phase II projects involved fieldwork including labelled 13CO2 pulses; site access resumed after 2001 restrictions.

# Key Results

## Above-ground biomass and productivity (2002)
- Clear hierarchical response to treatments: nitrogen and lime together most productive; unfertilised plots less productive.
- 2002 biomass generally fell compared with 2001 across most treatments, but long-term increase continues from 1999 baseline.
- Control 2 plots showed the strongest relative declines in 2002; productivity also declined along downslope gradient.
- Statistical: significant treatment effects and a strong Year x Treatment interaction.

## Relationships with soil properties
- Lime raised soil pH substantially (near 7.0 in upper soil) in limed plots; nitrogen alone raised pH modestly.
- Moisture tends to decrease as pH and fertility rise; there is a strong negative correlation between moisture and pH.
- Biomass productivity shows a positive relationship with soil pH overall, but within N- or Lime-treated plots the positive relationship weakens; with both nitrogen and lime, the relationship may become negative.

## Point Analysis and species composition (2002)
- Improved plots (N, Lime, N&L) show higher frequencies of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots dominated more by Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declines observed across treatments (~40% drop since 2000), suggesting a mowing-related or site-wide effect.
- Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) increase across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus becomes more common, accounting for a notable portion of hits.
- Litter (dead vegetation) hits rise in later years, with nitrogen-plus-lime plots showing the highest mean litter hits.
- Diversity indices (Shannon) show treatment-driven changes: baseline differences vanish, but by 2000–2002 differences emerge; nitrogen-and-lime plots show reduced diversity compared with other plots (up to 15% drop relative to baseline by 2002), while some treatments (especially Insecticide) show diversity gains (up to ~29% in 2002).
- PCA of species data in 2002 clearly separates improved (fertilised) versus unimproved plots; limed plots cluster with nitrogen-treated plots, and bryophytes trend differently from vascular plants.

## Functional groups and plant strategies
- Functional grouping based on CSR framework (Competitive-C, Stress-tolerant S, Ruderal R, and SR/C-S-R combinations).
- In 2000–2002, the SR/C-S-R and C-S-R groups dominate the communities in various plots (69%–95% of hits per plot).
- In 2002, C-S-R species become dominant in nitrogen+lime plots; stress-tolerant species expand in unimproved plots; SR-C-S-R groups are reduced in lime-treated and insecticide plots.
- Across years, treatment differences in the SR/C-S-R groups become statistically significant, indicating shifts in functional composition due to management.

# Discussion: Interpretive Themes

## 4.1 Mowing effect
- Decline of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis by >40% since 2000 across all treatments, suggesting a site-wide response to mowing regime rather than a single treatment.
- Festuca rubra expands, especially in fertilised plots, linking to lime- and nitrogen-driven nutrient addition and competitive advantage.
- Widespread expansion of bryophytes; mowing at ~6 cm height plus lack of grazing may facilitate bryophyte proliferation, partially offsetting vascular plant productivity.
- Disturbance reduction (grazing exclusion) appears to favor stress-tolerant species, reducing ruderal groups in some plots.

## 4.2 Fertilisation effect
- Nitrogen and/or lime consistently boost productivity since 1999; plots with both N and lime are most productive, though signs of possible peak or stress at high pH and lower soil moisture emerge.
- High lime application elevates pH toward ~7.0 with potential chlorosis during 2002, suggesting nutrient imbalance risks at very high pH or dry periods.
- Fertilisation facilitates a functional shift toward competitive, high-growth species (C-S-R) and reduces some SR-C-S-R and stress-tolerant groups in high-nutrient plots.
- Interaction between pH and moisture influences productivity; high pH plots may become moisture-limited under dry conditions, reducing gains.

## 4.3 Insecticide effect
- Insecticide (Dursban) may influence plant diversity through herbivory regulation, consistent with some ecological studies, but a direct causal link to diversity remains inconclusive without explicit herbivore data.
- Observed patterns align with the notion that reducing herbivory can allow more palatable species to persist in an otherwise infertile environment, potentially maintaining higher diversity, but evidence is not definitive.

## 4.4 Trampling effect
- The first sampling in C2 plots (introduced in 2002) coincided with intense activity related to 13CO2 pulses, likely suppressing vegetation growth and depressing measured productivity in those plots relative to C1.

# Conclusions and Implications
- Fertilisation (N and Lime) consistently enhances above-ground productivity, with the strongest gains when combined; long-term responses suggest potential saturation or stress at very high pH and reduced soil moisture.
- Mowing, grazing exclusion, and acidification-related conditions favor stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities, while improved plots shift toward competitive grasses.
- Species composition and functional-group structure shift in response to treatments, with notable declines in certain grasses (Agrostis spp.) and increases in Festuca rubra and bryophytes in fertilised and unfertilised plots, respectively.
- Biodiversity outcomes are nuanced: some treatments uplift diversity (notably insecticide plots), while fertilisation can reduce Shannon diversity; the net effect depends on the balance between productivity, nutrient status, disturbance, and plant functional traits.
- The dataset provides long-term, multi-dimensional insights into how mowing, nutrient addition, herbivore pressure (via insecticide), and trampling interact to shape plant communities and productivity in managed grassland ecosystems.
