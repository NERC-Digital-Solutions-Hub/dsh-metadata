# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- A large field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, intended to provide a broad monitoring context for associated research groups and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- The Baseline Data Survey (November 1998) underpins the experimental design; a wide range of measurements were prescribed to contextualise detailed studies.
- 2001 site management was affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (visitor access limited February–May; protocol-based resumption thereafter) and a change of Officer in Charge.
- Data collection and dissemination emphasized data provenance, standardised methods, and links to a central data manager; an Automatic Weather Station supplied site weather data.

## Monitoring design and data management

- The Sourhope experiment employed a multi-faceted monitoring framework to provide general context for detailed studies across years.
- Data collection encompassed weather, biomass, soil chemistry, and botanical composition, with standardized procedures to aid cross-project comparisons.
- 2001 management adjustments followed a site management plan; field sampling proceeded under veterinary guidance and site protocols.
- Weather data were regularly downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager; standardised measurement and analysis methods were used (e.g., Genstat 5, PCA, ANOVA).
- Methods for above-ground biomass included five mowing occasions per summer; biomass was dried and summed, with transformations (ln) for statistical analyses.
- Botanical surveys used a Point Quadrat framework (100 cells per cell, 25 punctures per survey) to determine species hits and relative abundances; separate surveys were conducted by different investigators but showed no significant inter-surveyor differences in 2001.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data: rainfall near long-term average; total annual rainfall lower than 2000 but still within the range observed previously.
- Total annual radiation steady; average temperatures slightly lower than prior years.
- Average soil moisture content marginally higher than in preceding years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- A consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak biomass occurred in July or August each year.
- 2001 biomass estimates were substantially higher than in previous years, likely due to a combination of staff changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Normalisation against the C1 treatment revealed the strongest biomass response to nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, lime; nitrogen and lime together produced the most pronounced increases.
- Split-plot ANOVA showed significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots and a significant year-by-treatment interaction, but no significant differences between blocks.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continued to raise surface soil pH; October 2001 averages were 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen-and-lime plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raised soil pH, though to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed little change from baseline measures (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat survey followed the 2000 protocol; inter-surveyor consistency was confirmed.
- Total survey hits in 2001 were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting increased sward density, possibly related to reduced grazing in 1998.
- Treatments influenced species composition: Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001, Festuca spp. increased (notably F. ovina and F. rubra depending on treatment), and improved plots (especially N and/or L) showed more species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis).
- The unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) maintained higher species richness (24 species) compared with the nitrogen-and-lime plots (18 species), implying a possible decline in diversity with improved fertility and liming.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separated nitrogen and/or lime treatments from control and biocide plots; unimproved plots tended to be associated with bryophytes and species like Agrostis vinealis, Nardus stricta, and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- In biomass correlations, Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundances increased with biomass, while Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, and bryophytes tended to decline as biomass rose; litter frequency increased with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition: spatial heterogeneity exists across columns, with some right-hand slope columns showing relatively more acidic conditions; underlying heterogeneity may influence treatment responses.
- 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass: certain plots exhibited notably low biomass (outliers), while central plots tended to have higher biomass; a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass was observed, with no significant differences in biomass between blocks.

## Data collection and interpretation context

- The study used a structured, repeatable monitoring framework linking management practices, soil fertility amendments, and vegetation responses.
- Analytical approaches included annual and inter-year ANOVA, PCA, and correlation analyses to relate biomass, soil chemistry, and species composition.
- Results highlight how fertility amendments (nitrogen and lime) reshape biomass production and plant community composition, while spatial heterogeneity and management changes influence observed patterns.
- Data sources and methods were designed to support cross-year comparisons and integration with other research within the NERC Soil Biodiversity programme.
