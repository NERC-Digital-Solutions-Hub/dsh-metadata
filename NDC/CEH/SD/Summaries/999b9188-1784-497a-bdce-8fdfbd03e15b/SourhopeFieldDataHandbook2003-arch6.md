## Vegetation surveys (Block 4–5 and Ecotron)
- Plot-level surveys provide presence/absence and abundance for dominant taxa (examples include Ac, Ao, Fr, Ns, Pp, Tr, Vc, etc.) across plots 4A–4F, 5A–5F, and Ecotron plots.
- National Vegetation Classification alignments (e.g., U4d, with possible U5b occurrences) indicate grassland community types and indicator species by block/plot.
- Data are organized by plot and subplot, enabling analyses of species richness and compositional shifts in relation to soil gradients and treatments.

## Site details and metadata
- Block 4 and Block 5 site details include grid references, altitude, slope, soil drainage, soil series (e.g., Sourhope Series, major subgroup Brown forest soils with gleying), and dominant rock types (igneous/andesite).
- Data collection year: 1998; includes horizon-level data, auger samples, and vegetation surveys; designed as baseline for long-term ecological studies and cross-site comparisons.

## Data quality, caveats, and notes for data use
- Early baseline (1998) provides cross-horizon baselines but may not capture year-to-year variability; seasonal effects observed for herbaceous components.
- Subplot sampling covered a subset of plots; results are indicative rather than exhaustive for all subplots.
- Random allocation of treatments within blocks; some treatments adjusted during study; Ecotron plots provide controlled-context data.
- Users should consult detailed tables and appendices (e.g., Twinspan classifications, NVC alignments, association analyses) for nuanced interpretation of community patterns.

## Potential data products and use cases (Data Support focus)
- Baseline soil and vegetation data catalog for Sourhope Field Site, enabling integration with ECN and Ecotron records.
- Block- and plot-level datasets for longitudinal analyses of vegetation shifts and soil property changes under lime, nitrogen, biocide, and related treatments.
- Ecological dashboards showing dominant species, species richness by slope position, and soil chemical gradients across blocks.
- Reproducible Twinspan and NVC classifications with indicator species by plot and horizon-level data for cross-study comparisons.
- Cross-study integration with Ecotron and Micronet to explore links between soil microbial/plant communities and abiotic soil properties.
