# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview and scope
- Documents soil profiles, soil chemistry, and vegetation data from Sourhope field site, focusing on Blocks 4 and 5, with accompanying ECOTRON plot data.
- Captures detailed horizon descriptions, laboratory analyses (nutrients, carbon, nitrogen, pH, LOI, moisture loss), auger samples, and long-term vegetation surveys at multiple plots.
- Includes site metadata (grid references, altitude, slope, drainage), parent material, and major soil subgroups; data are tracked with MLURI barcodes and archived for long-term use.

## Data types and structure
- Soil profiles
  - Block 4: Horizon sequence LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bsg, Cgx (0–95 cm), with detailed soil descriptions and boundary characteristics.
  - Block 5: Horizon sequence LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg (0–100 cm), with descriptive horizons and boundary types.
  - Descriptions note mineral content (often fibrous), root presence, texture (e.g., sandy silt loam, clay loam), mottling, structure (blocky/granular), presence of stones, and boundary clarity.
- Soil analyses (per horizon)
  - Weight (Wt, mg); %N; %C; C:N ratio; Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g); %Moisture loss; %Loss on ignition; pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Block 4: notable high LOI in surface horizons (FH and H), acidic pH around 4.7–5.0, Ca/Mg/K variability, and presence of igneous stones.
  - Block 5: similar horizon chemistry with progression into deeper horizons;Ca and other cations vary by horizon (Cg horizons show elevated Ca in near-surface horizons for some sub-horizons); pH ~4.5–5.0.
- Auger samples
  - Block 4 and Block 5 auger samples with Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2) across multiple sample IDs (e.g., 4A–4F, 5A–5F).
  - Data show generally acidic conditions, elevated LOI in surface materials, and horizon-specific chemical gradients.
- Vegetation surveys
  - Block-level and plot-level species occurrences across multiple plots (e.g., 4A–4F; 5A–5F) with species codes (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris, Ao = Anthoxanthum odoratum, Fr = Festuca rubra, Ns = Nardus stricta, Pp = Poa pratensis, etc.).
  - Subplot and plot totals indicate dominant grasses and indicator species; data structured to support comparisons with vegetation classifications (e.g., NVC communities).
- ECOTRON site
  - Soil analysis: single ECOTRON plot with Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pHCaCl2.
  - Vegetation survey: per-plot species counts and totals for ECOTRON plots, aligned with the experimental design.
- Metadata and provenance
  - Site details for Blocks 4 and 5 (grid references, altitude, slope, drainage), soil series and major subgroups, parent material, rock types.
  - MLURI Barcode tracking for horizon samples and augers; associated with archiving (Merlewood) and long-term storage.
  - Appendix-like data mappings include block/plot/horizon designations and crosswalks to plant species codes and soil horizon nomenclature.

## Block-specific highlights (Blocks 4 and 5)
- Block 4
  - Horizon sequence includes LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bsg, Cgx with textural and morphological observations (stone content, mottling, pore structure).
  - Profiles show acidic pH values (approx. 4.8–5.0 in surface horizons), high LOI in surface horizons (notably FH and H), and substantial organic matter in the upper horizons.
  - Auger and horizon data indicate variation in N, C, C:N, and cation chemistry across horizons and blocks, with some blocks showing incomplete data notes.
  - Vegetation data show diverse plot-level compositions with dominant grasses and indicator species; plot-level totals provide a basis for relation to soil properties.
- Block 5
  - Distinct horizon sequence with deeper ABg, Bg, BCg horizons and a Cg horizon, reflecting a more developed profile.
  - Soils described as brown forest soils with gleying; presence of medium to very fine igneous stones; horizon-to-horizon variation in Ca, Mg, and other cations.
  - Auger data indicate variable Ca, Mg, K, and moisture loss; pH values across horizons remain acidic (approx. 4.4–5.0).
  - Block 5 auger and horizon data reveal gradients in nutrient status and organic matter with depth; soil profile shows mottling and variable structure across horizons.
  - Vegetation data across plots show mixed dominance among Ac, Ao, Ns, Fr, Pp, and other indicators; per-plot totals indicate community composition consistent with upland grassland/shrub-edge dynamics.

## Data governance, provenance, and archiving
- Provenance
  - Ground-truthed via soil pits, auger sampling, and vegetation surveys; linked to Soil Biodiversity Programme baseline data.
  - Analytical methods referenced (e.g., horizon-based analyses, LOI, C:N, pH assays) with horizon-specific reporting.
- Data storage and archiving
  - Primary data stored on MLURI server; long-term sample archives maintained at Merlewood (-80°C) for soil samples.
  - MLURI barcodes (e.g., 603951–603963 for block 4 profiles) used to track samples; ECOTRON and block-level data linked to project documentation (Twinspan/Association analyses references).
- Data accessibility
  - Data and analyses are published within the Sourhope Field Data Handbook; references to data files (e.g., Twinspan.doc/pdf, Association.xls) support reuse and cross-referencing.
- Data quality and notes
  - Horizon-level anomalies and cross-block variations noted in data (with some blocks showing incomplete data entries or boundary notes).
  - Crosswalks provided between horizon designations and standard soil taxonomy where possible.

## Practical implications for data stewards
- Metadata completeness
  - Ensure horizon names, depth ranges, boundary type, sampling dates, and measurement methods are fully documented; link horizons to standard soil taxonomy when feasible.
- Provenance and lineage
  - Preserve original survey data, horizon-specific analyses, and block-level experimental design; maintain crosswalks to vegetation codes and NVC classifications.
- Data dictionaries and accessibility
  - Provide clear variable dictionaries (N, C, LOI, pH, etc.), units, and horizon designations; reference related analyses and appendices for context and reuse.
- Archiving and preservation
  - Maintain long-term storage for soil samples (-80°C) and ensure robust data backups; document archiving procedures and access controls.
- Data quality and transparency
  - Record anomalies, data gaps (e.g., incomplete blocks), and data processing steps; maintain changelogs and data quality assessments to guide future stewardship.
