# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report 2002

- Purpose and scope
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope field site (Macaulay Institute, Scottish Borders).
  - Focus on aboveground productivity (biomass), plant species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) in relation to five site treatments and mowing management.
  - Treatments include Control 1, Control 2 (unfertilised), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Insecticide plots.
  - Data products aim to enable cross-project use and understanding of above- and below-ground links.

- Data collection and data types
  - Above-ground productivity: annual biomass estimates from random 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots; five mowing occasions per summer (May–Sept); biomass dried and weighed.
  - Point analysis surveys: baseline (Aug 1998) and annual surveys (2000–2002) using a 0.5 m2 cell with a 100-hole grid; species touches recorded per hole (plus bryophyte identification in 2002).
  - Soil and site measurements: soil pH (0–5 cm), soil moisture (theta probe, August 2002), and on-site Automatic Weather Station data (rainfall, radiation, temperatures) from Feb 1999 onward.
  - Vegetation detail: species list including bryophytes; biomass by plot; litter presence; diversity indices (Shannon index); functional-group classification (CSR: stress-tolerators S, competitive-stress-ruderal CS-R, SR/CSR).
  - Additional small-scale botanical surveys and laboratory-processed samples (e.g., minirhizotron plots, nested biomass samples).

- Experimental design and management
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells allocated to research groups.
  - Annual management tasks: monthly mowing (May–Sept) to ~6 cm; insecticide application (Dursban 4 OPA) after mowing on insecticide plots; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime on designated plots.
  - Treatments (treatment-year specifics)
    - Nitrogen: NH4NO3, 24 g m-2 per year in two spring/time-late doses.
    - Lime: CaCO3, 600 g m-2 per year in spring.
    - Nitrogen & Lime: combination of above.
    - Insecticide: Dursban 4 OPA applied after mowing (details per year available in Appendix 2).

- Key results (2002 highlights)
  - Overall biomass: 2002 showed lower productivity than 2001 across several treatments, but long-term biomass production rose since 1999; highest productivity still in N+L plots.
  - Treatment effects on biomass (2002): significant differences among treatments; annual biomass totals show a decline from 2001 to 2002, especially in Control 2 and other non-fertilised plots.
  - Fertilisation effects: nitrogen and/or lime consistently increase biomass; plots with both N and lime highest; potential plateau or stress at very high lime levels (pH ~7.0) with possible moisture-related growth limitation.
  - Soil chemistry and productivity relationship: soil pH rose significantly with lime, particularly in upper soil; moisture content negatively correlated with pH (r ≈ -0.68); positive overall correlation between soil pH and biomass when pooling treatments (r ≈ 0.69).
  - Functional-group shifts: with N+L, C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species expand; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerators (S); strong pH effects influence functional-group composition.
  - Insecticide effects: Shannon diversity highest in insecticide-treated plots; potential link to reduced herbivory, but evidence is circumstantial and context-dependent.
  - Trampling effects: C2 plots (novel trampling context in 2002) show depressed productivity, likely linked to intense sampling/13CO2 pulse activities.
  - Bryophyte dynamics: bryophyte hits increased across the site (19.92% in 2002 vs 10.82% in 2001; up from 6.48% in 2000); greatest relative increase in unimproved plots; moss expansion linked to reduced vascular plant competition and mowing regime.
  - Diversity changes: Shannon Diversity Index declined in 2002 in the N+L plots (about 15% lower than baseline) while other treatments showed modest increases, indicating treatment-dependent shifts in diversity.
  - Species and functional group patterns (point analysis): two fertile pasture grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) dominant in N+L and lime plots; unimproved plots retain abundance of Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.; PCA reflects clear separation of improved (fertilised) vs. unimproved plots; bryophyte and dicot/higher-order shifts observed over time.
  - Major functional-group composition (2000–2002): three dominant groups—stress-tolerators (S), CSR group (C-S-R), and SR/CSR—together account for a large majority of hits; differences in 2002 show significant treatment effects across all three groupings.

- Data outputs and outputs for end users
  - Time-series and comparative summaries of above-ground biomass by treatment and year (1999–2002); plotting of biomass relative to Control 1.
  - Point-analysis outputs: annual species hits by treatment, including bryophytes; detailed species lists and abundance patterns (Appendix 3, 8).
  - Diversity metrics: Shannon diversity indices by treatment across years; changes relative to baseline (1998).
  - Functional-group analyses: proportions of S, CSR, SR/CSR across treatments and years (Table 2, Figure 9).
  - Multivariate analyses: PCA plots showing treatment separation and loadings for species (Figure 5); axis loadings delineate groups such as Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis vs. Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp.
  - Appendices provide raw data and metadata: biomass per plot (Appendix 6), rank in biomass (Appendix 7), bryophyte species (Appendix 3), species-by-treatment analyses (Appendix 8).
  - Data-quality notes: 2002 weather-station malfunction caused missing data periods; replacement data drawn from Konza station for affected dates; some plots (Control 2) were not surveyed in 2000–2001.

- Data quality, gaps and context
  - Missing data in 2002 due to weather-station failures; data gaps mitigated with nearby station data for July–Nov 2002.
  - Control 2 plots not surveyed in 2000–2001; some additional small-scale surveys conducted selectively.
  - Overall, long-term data support robust trends across years and treatments, enabling cross-project data integration and broader interpretation.

- Practical implications for data use
  - The dataset supports cross-project analyses linking above-ground productivity, plant community composition, and soil variables (pH, moisture) under different management regimes.
  - Data products (biomass, diversity indices, PCA loadings, functional-group distributions) are suitable for dashboards, reports, or bespoke analyses by policy-makers, land managers, and researchers.
  - The structure demonstrates how data from mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide treatments influence plant functional strategies and bryophyte dynamics in managed grassland ecosystems.
