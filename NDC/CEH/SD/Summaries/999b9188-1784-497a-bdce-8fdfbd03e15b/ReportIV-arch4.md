# SUMMARY

- Context and objectives
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on a large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) to understand soil biodiversity and its functional roles, alongside links to above-ground plant communities.
  - Primary botanical monitoring focuses on above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity, with 16 Phase I and 8 Phase II projects contributing data.
  - Goals include understanding data availability, gaps, suitability, and how data support an integrated data system across partners.

- Experimental design and treatments
  - Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated randomly.
  - Treatments (plot-level and site-level): 
    - Control 1 and Control 2 (no treatment)
    - Nitrogen, Lime
    - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
    - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA, soil insecticide)
  - Site management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept); insecticide applied after mowing; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime; data collection aligned with mowing schedule.

- Data collected and collection methods
  - Weather and site climate: continuous on-site Automatic Weather Station data (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, moisture).
  - Above-ground productivity: biomass harvested from randomly chosen 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots prior to each mow; samples dried and weighed; annual biomass totals derived from five summer cuts.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline (1998) using 0.5 m2 quadrats; annual/fixed-interval point analysis surveys (2000, 2001, 2002) with a 100-hole grid; bryophyte identification improved in 2002.
  - Soil chemistry and moisture: soil pH measured at 5 cm depth; soil moisture measured in 2002 with theta probe; additional soil sampling since 1998; various ancillary surveys (small plots, minirhizotron areas, biomass sorting).
  - Data scope: by 2002, 11,621 soil samples collected; extensive appendices detailing site activity, species lists (vascular plants and bryophytes), and biomass data per plot.

- Key results and trends (2002 highlights)
  - Biomass and productivity
    - A clear treatment hierarchy in biomass persisted, but 2002 saw a general drop in absolute productivity across several treatments compared with 2001.
    - Long-term trend shows biomass increasing from 1999 baseline; nitrogen and lime (especially combined N&L) yield the highest productivity; Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1 in several years.
    - A notable slope-related pattern: Block 5 experienced larger declines than Block 1, indicating spatial gradient effects on productivity.
  - Species composition and diversity
    - Mowing effects: reduction in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across almost all treatments; Festuca rubra expands especially in fertilised plots.
    - Bryophytes (mosses) increase across the site, enhanced by regular mowing and reduced grazing; bryophyte abundance higher in unimproved plots and associated with rising moss coverage in 2002.
    - fertilisation shifts: improved plots (N and/or Lime) show dominance of nutrient- and growth-favouring species; lime-driven pH increases correlate with changes in species groups.
  - Functional group dynamics (CSR framework)
    - Stress-tolerators (S) expand in unimproved plots; competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and stress-ruderal (SR) groups increase in fertilised plots; combined N&L plots show strong C-S-R dynamics.
    - Higher pH (from lime) tends to favour C-S-R species; nitrogen-alone plots show different patterns, with lime contributing more to pH-driven effects.
  - Insecticide effects
    - The insecticide treatment (Dursban 4) appears to influence plant diversity, but causality is cautioned due to lack of complete control data on all interactions; observed patterns align with literature suggesting herbivore pressure can influence diversity outcomes.
  - Data quality and analysis
    - Statistical analyses (split-plot ANOVA, PCA) reveal significant treatment, year, and interaction effects on biomass and community composition.
    - 2002 PCA demonstrates clear separation of lime-treated plots from others, with nitrogen-treated samples sharing similarities with limed plots in some blocks.
    - Shannon diversity indices show increasing divergence post-2000, with notable declines in N&L plots by 2002.

- Data governance, quality, and accessibility
  - Data structured by site-level and plot-level treatments across 5 blocks; multiple data streams (biomass, point analyses, bryophyte lists, soil chemistry, weather).
  - Data management emphasizes consistency, baseline comparisons, and year-to-year updates; detailed appendices provide species lists, biomass per plot, and rank abundance analyses.
  - Primary data and detailed methodologies are available via the Soil Biodiversity website and CEH contacts, enabling cross-project data reuse and integration.

- Implications for Data Leaders
  - Demonstrates the value of a holistic, longitudinal data system that combines above- and below-ground measurements, climate data, and multiple management treatments to understand system-wide effects.
  - Highlights the importance of:
    - Clear metadata and mapping between plots, blocks, treatments, and research groups to support co-ownership of data products.
    - Standardised, repeatable data collection protocols and transformations (e.g., log-transformations for biomass analyses; PCA for multivariate community data).
    - Accessible data repositories and documentation to enable cross-network collaboration among researchers and managers.
  - Shows how long-term, multi-disciplinary data can reveal complex interactions (grazing/mowing, nutrient amendments, pest control) and guide future management decisions.

- Gaps, caveats, and future steps
  - Certain 2000–2001 data subsets (e.g., Control 2 plant surveys) were not conducted in some years; weather data gaps occurred in mid-2002 due to equipment issues.
  - While strong associations are observed, attributing causality (e.g., specific insecticide effects on diversity) remains cautious; continued monitoring and controlled analyses are needed to disentangle interacting factors.
  - Ongoing need to maintain robust metadata standards, ensure data discoverability, and document methodological changes (e.g., bryophyte identification improvements) for accurate longitudinal comparisons.
