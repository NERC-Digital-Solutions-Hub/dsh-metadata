# SUMMARY

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders), focusing on above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and diversity, and their links to soil and ecosystem processes.
  - Aimed to monitor how management practices influence plant communities and their functions, informing policy and decision-making.

- Site design and management (monitoring framework)
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient, each with 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated at random within blocks.
  - Five main plot-level treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, plus a separate Insecticide (Dursban) treatment.
  - Site-wide management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept) since 1999; insecticide applied after mowing on Insecticide plots; fertiliser (N and/or lime) applied in spring; detailed yearly application schedules available in appendices.

- Data collection and measures (monitoring outputs)
  - Climate and site context: on-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999; headline weather data and period-specific notes included.
  - Above-ground productivity: regular biomass estimates from randomly chosen 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots; samples dried and weighed.
  - Botanical surveys:
    - Baseline survey (1998) and annual point analyses (2000–2002) using a 0.5 m2 cell with a 100-hole grid; land cover recorded by touching vegetation with a pin at 25 points per cell.
    - Bryophyte and liverwort identification enhanced in 2002.
  - Soils and moisture: soil pH measured (0–5 cm depth); soil moisture measured with theta probe in 2002; soil sampling ongoing since 1998.
  - Other small-scale surveys: vegetation cover in microplots, biomass sorting by species, and disturbance-related surveys.
  - Data scope: field activity across Phase I and II projects; total site soil samples collected to date exceed 11,600.

- Key analytical approaches
  - Biomass trends assessed with repeated measurements (May–Sept) and ANOVA (split-plot design) to test Treatment, Year, and interactions.
  - Treatment normalisation: biomass per plot expressed relative to a control reference (Control 1) to compare across years.
  - Soil–plant relationships: analysis of soil pH, moisture, and productivity; both overall correlations and treatment-specific patterns.
  - Multivariate analyses: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on point-analysis data to differentiate improved vs. unimproved plots and to examine species-group patterns.
  - Diversity metrics: Shannon diversity indices calculated over time to assess changes in plant diversity.
  - Functional groups: classification into CSR (Competitiveness, Stress-tolerance, Ruderal) framework and related dynamics (S, C-S-R, SR/C-S-R) across treatments and years.

- Major findings by management effect

  - Mowing effect
    - Consistent decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across most years, suggesting a site-level response to mowing rather than a single treatment effect.
    - Festuca rubra expansion linked to more fertile/fertilised plots and mowing, contributing to altered species balance.
    - Bryophytes (mosses) expanded across the site, particularly in the absence of grazing and with mowing, aided by ~6 cm sward height; this dampened by higher vascular plant productivity in fertilised plots.
    - Stress-tolerant species increased under most conditions, consistent with reduced disturbance due to removal of grazing.

  - Fertilisation (Nitrogen and/or Lime)
    - Clear, positive effect on above-ground productivity; plots with both nitrogen and lime showed the strongest gains.
    - Productivity in fertilised plots possibly trending toward a peak (soil pH approaching 7.0) and potential moisture limitations in the N+L plots, which may influence ongoing productivity.
    - Lime raised soil pH substantially; higher pH correlated with higher biomass overall, though the relationship varied by treatment (less clear in plots with both N and Lime).
    - Nitrogen addition alone sometimes less beneficial than lime alone; combined N+L facilitated faster growth but could increase vulnerability to water stress due to drier soil in fertilised plots.

  - Insecticide (Dursban) effect
    - Plant diversity responses are complex and not directly attributable to the insecticide without more targeted herbivory data; diversity trends resembled some Brown & Gange (1989) patterns in certain contexts, but a direct causal link remains uncertain.
    - The insecticide-treated plots showed diversity patterns that interacted with other treatments; bryophyte and vascular plant dynamics suggest indirect effects via herbivore pressure and community competition.

  - Trampling effect (C2 plots)
    - First-year data in 2002 indicate reduced productivity in some C2 plots, likely due to trampling during intense sampling or experimental pulses (e.g., labelled 13CO2 pulses), rather than a treatment effect per se.

  - Functional and community-level dynamics
    - CSR-based functional shifts: under fertilised conditions, competitive (C) and stress-ruderal (SR) groups become more prominent; unimproved plots favour stress-tolerant (S) species.
    - Over time, lime and nitrogen tend to support C-S-R profiles; unimproved plots retain higher S-dominance.
    - Point analyses show two grass species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) enriched in N/L plots; overall bryophyte hits increased in unimproved plots, while more fertile plots showed more dicots and competitive grasses.
    - Shannon diversity decreased in the N&L plots by 2002 relative to other treatments; other treatments showed stability or increases in diversity.
    - Bryophyte abundance rose across treatments, with notable increases in unimproved plots; bryophyte dominance rose in parallel with shifts in vascular plant groups.

- Data, reporting, and governance considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - The study demonstrates the value of long-term, multi-factor field experiments to track policy-relevant environmental health measures (biomass, diversity, functional types).
  - It highlights the importance of integrating above- and below-ground indicators (soil pH, moisture, climate data; plant productivity and composition; bryophytes) to interpret ecosystem responses to management.
  - Data handling and interpretation challenges noted (metadata quality, standardisation, potential data-sharing barriers; need for consistent data governance and data provenance).
  - The breadth of data collected (appendices with site activity, species lists, weather, biomass, and point-analysis results) provides a rich basis for policy-relevant monitoring and methodological transfer to other policy contexts.

- Implications for monitoring practice and policy evaluation
  - Long-term, multi-treatment monitoring with standardized protocols yields insights into how nutrient addition, liming, mowing, and pest management shape productivity, diversity, and functional group composition.
  - The CSR framework and PCA-based analyses offer robust approaches for disentangling treatment effects on plant functional composition and community structure.
  - Observed data support cautious interpretation of management changes, recognizing that site-specific factors (e.g., slope, disturbance regimes) and cross-treatment interactions influence outcomes.
  - Data transparency and governance considerations (sharing of underlying data, metadata quality, and data management standards) are essential for enabling broader use of monitoring results in environmental policy making.
