# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and scope
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive study of Sourhope field site (Scottish Borders) to provide broad context for detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.
  - Site management impacted in 2001 by Foot and Mouth restrictions, with restricted access Feb–May; subsequent sampling guided by veterinary protocol. Change of site officer occurred in 2001.

## 2. Results

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 weather generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after a very wet prior year; total radiation similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than previously.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Clear hierarchy of biomass among treatments; peak biomass in July/Aug each year.
  - 2001 biomass higher than 1999–2000, likely due to personnel change and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - After normalising to C1, nitrogen and lime treatments show strongest positive impact on productivity.
  - ANOVA (log biomass) indicates:
    - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots.
    - Significant year-by-treatment interaction.
    - No significant differences between blocks.
  - Overall, nitrogen and/or lime promote higher above-ground biomass; interaction suggests effects vary by year.

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Liming continued to raise soil pH in the top 5 cm.
  - October 2001 means: limed plots ~6.19; N&L plots ~6.38; nitrogen alone also raised pH but less so.
  - Control plots remained close to baseline pH (not significantly changed since Aug 1998).

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - July 2001 point quadrat survey replicated 2000 protocol; no significant difference between surveyors.
  - Total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than 2000, indicating denser sward, possibly due to removal of grazing stock in 1998.
  - Treatment effects on species composition:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
    - Festuca species increased across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen alone (F. ovina) and Nitrogen + Lime (F. rubra) plots.
    - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more apparent in fertilised plots, especially N+L.
    - Species linked to less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
  - Diversity: 24 species identified in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime, suggesting potential early decline in diversity in highly improved plots.
  - Multivariate analysis (PCA) shows clear separation of fertilised/limed plots from control/biocide plots; high positive association of Festuca rubra with improved plots; control plots cluster with less fertile-associated species.
  - Abundance vs biomass: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance increases with biomass; abundances of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline as biomass rises; nitrogen and/or lime treatments associated with increased litter and faster vegetation turnover.

## 3. Site heterogeneity

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F tend to be more acidic than others, a pattern amplified by the treatment distribution (notably with more Controls/Biocide in those columns).

- 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
  - Some plots show markedly lower biomass (outliers) across treatments; central plots generally exhibit higher biomass.
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass production.

- Additional notes
  - Across the year, biomass correlates positively with soil pH, reinforcing the link between fertility management (lime/ nitrogen) and productivity.
  - Site-wide blocks showed no significant difference in biomass variation, suggesting spatial heterogeneity rather than block effects drives some observed differences.
