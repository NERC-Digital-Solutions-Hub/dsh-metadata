# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Documents the Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Programme and the Soil Biodiversity site at Rigg Foot, Sourhope.
- Describes site selection, climate, geology, soils, vegetation, land use, facilities, and current/future research aims.
- Emphasises long-term, large-scale, indigenously vegetated upland grasslands experiments and environmental monitoring.

## Location & Context
- Sourhope Experimental Farm: 982.2 ha total; main site on Rigg Foot north-facing slope (~309 m elevation).
- Climate: Euoceanic, very humid; detailed monthly temperature history; rainfall data from ECN.
- Geology/Soils: Andesitic lavas; soils range from acid brown forest soils to peaty gleys; mainly grassland with moor and conifer patches.
- Land use: Extensive hill sheep/cattle operations; cashmere goats for genetics/sustainability studies; integrated with commercial farming.

## Site Design & Experimental Layout (Soil Biodiversity Site)
- Established in 1998 on Rigg Foot: five blocks, total of 30 plots.
- Main plots: 12 m x 20 m; five blocks north–south; within each main plot, subplots labeled A–Q (50 cm x 50 cm quadrats) for vegetation/soil sampling; Ecotron area (8 m x 24 m) with subplots A–M.
- Treatments (randomised within blocks): Control; Lime; Nitrogen; Lime + Nitrogen; Biocide; Fallow (initially included, later used as extra controls).
- Grazing: Plots fenced since 1998; grazing pressure previously present; periodic cutting to simulate grazing.
- Data collection framework: Vegetation sampled via 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats in five of the fifteen subplots per main plot; data recorded as presence/absence with possible abundance notes.

## Vegetation Data & Analyses
- Dominant species across site: Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Species richness: 25 species recorded; richness tends to increase downslope; edge effects and microhabitat variation observed.
- Analyses used:
  - Twinspan to group samples and identify frequent associations.
  - National Vegetation Classification (NVC) matching: most plots align with U4d (Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland; Luzula multiflora-Rhytidiadelphus loreus subcommunity); some plots align with U5b (Nardus stricta-Galium saxatile grassland, Agrostis canina-Polytrichum commune subcommunity) in moister areas.
  - Association analyses to identify indicator species and plot-level communities.
- Key patterns:
  - Indicator species include F. ovina, R. repens, D. flexuosa, H. mollis; D. flexuosa concentrates on edge plots; Juncus effusus occurs in scattered clumps.
  - Four main community groups identified; richest community features A. capillaris, A. odoratum, F. rubra, N. stricta, Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, with Poa pratensis often present.
- Datasets/appendices: Detailed species-by-plot and block data available.

## Soil Sampling, Analysis & Profile Data
- Sampling design:
  - 0–30 cm auger cores: 30 cores per plot in a W pattern; cores bulked per plot.
  - Profile pits: 1 m pits in pathways above each block for horizon sequences (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, BCx, C, etc.); horizon descriptors recorded.
  - Sample handling: Immediate analysis and archival storage at -80°C.
- Chemical/physical parameters measured:
  - pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2); %N; %C; C:N; %Moisture; LOI; Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g); moisture loss; horizon descriptions.
  - Depth- and horizon-level variation; surface horizons typically acidic/humic; Ca/Mg higher in near-surface horizons.
- Data analyses:
  - Block-to-block differences in Ca, Na, Mg, pH; some blocks show anomalies.
  - Relationships identified via correlations/regressions: %N, %C, LOI, moisture loss, C:N interrelations; pH interacts with Ca/Na/Mg/LOI.
  - Principal component analyses indicate major variation driven by %N, %C, C:N, Ca, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI; pH contributes less.
- Summary outputs: Block means and horizon-specific data illustrate depth-dependent trends.

## Block 5: Soil & Vegetation Data (Illustrative)
- Detailed soil profile data (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with depth ranges (0–100 cm), horizon descriptions, and chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, moisture loss, LOI, pH).
- Auger sample analyses (5A–5F): %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2); shows variability across sub-samples.
- Vegetation data by plots within Block 5 (e.g., PLOT 5A–5F): species totals by subplot, presence/absence patterns, and community indicators.

## ECN Context & Research Integration
- Sourhope is a core ECN site and a focus of SERAD Micronet (1998–2002).
- Aims to understand floristic change, nutrient dynamics, and sustainability under varied management (liming, nitrogen, grazing, biocide perturbations).
- Data designed for GIS-enabled interpretation, enabling multi-layer map products and spatial analyses.

## Data Availability & GIS Applications
- GIS-ready potential layers:
  - Spatial layout: blocks, plots, subplots, Ecotron boundaries with precise coordinates.
  - Vegetation layer: presence/absence, abundance indicators, NVC classifications (U4d, U5b), Twinspan groupings, indicator species.
  - Soil layer: horizon-level properties per plot (pH, %N, %C, C:N, LOI, moisture loss), depth profiles, horizon codes.
  - Temporal layer: baseline 1998 data plus ongoing ECN measurements for long-term monitoring.
- Possible map products:
  - Soil property maps by block/plot (pH, %N, %C, C:N, LOI, moisture loss, Ca, Mg, Na, K).
  - Vegetation/classification maps (dominant communities, indicator species).
  - Gradient maps (horizon depth, drainage, sampling intensity).
  - Interaction maps linking treatments, grazing controls, and observed responses in vegetation/soil.

## Key Caveats & Data Limitations
- Sampling coverage limitations: vegetation analysis used five subplots per main plot; some plots lack complete data.
- Some blocks show anomalous soil chemistry values, requiring cautious interpretation.
- Treatments and grazing exclusions are perturbations; extrapolation to other sites should consider local context.

## End Notes
- The handbook consolidates site history, climate, geology, land use, and comprehensive baseline data (vegetation and soils) to support GIS-enabled interpretation and the development of data products for policy, stakeholders, and public audiences.
- Includes extensive block- and horizon-level data (Block 4, Block 5, ECOTRON plots) with detailed measurements and descriptive profiles to support map-based analyses and long-term monitoring.
