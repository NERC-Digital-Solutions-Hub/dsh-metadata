# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Report 2002

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused study at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute) tracks changes in above-ground productivity, plant community composition, and diversity under five main management themes: mowing, fertilisation, insecticide application, trampling, and overall site management.
- The site was fenced and mowed regularly (6 cm sward height) with five treatments varying in nitrogen and lime additions, plus an insecticide treatment, across a replicated plot design.

## Site management and data collection

- Experimental design: 5 blocks, each with 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated randomly.
- Annual management: monthly mowing May–Sept to ~6 cm; insecticide (Dursban 4) applied after mowing; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime per treatment.
- Data collected since 1999 include:
  - Weather: on-site automatic weather station data (temperature, rainfall, radiation, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground productivity: regular biomass harvests from 0.5 m2 cells, dried and weighed.
  - Vegetation surveys: baseline 1998; annual July/August point analyses using 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid.
  - Soil: soil pH (0–5 cm), soil moisture (theta probe), with additional measurements in certain sub-plots.
  - Site activity: fieldwork by Phase I and II projects, including 13CO2 pulse studies and trace gas measurements.
- Phases: Phase I (1998–2001) largely complete by 2002; Phase II ongoing with multiple visits in 2002.

## Key results

### 3.1 Weather
- 2002: lower rainfall in April and September, with wetter periods in February, July, and late year; winter 2001/02 unusually mild.

### 3.2 Above-ground biomass
- Overall pattern: biomass productivity remained higher in fertilised plots (nitrogen and/or lime) than unfertilised plots, continuing the long-term trend since 1999.
- 2002 lookback: biomass in 2002 fell relative to 2001 across many treatments (13.7% in N&L plots to 31.2% in Control 2), though still higher on average than 1999 starting levels.
- Most productive treatment: plots receiving both nitrogen and lime; Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1.
- Spatial pattern: steeper declines in biomass at lower slope blocks (Block 1 most improved relative to 2001; Block 5 showed the largest drop in absolute biomass).
- Statistical: significant treatment effects and a significant interaction between treatment and year (p < 0.001).

### 3.3 Interaction of soil pH, moisture, and productivity
- Lime raised soil pH significantly (to near 7 in upper soil layers); nitrogen also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
- Positive link between soil pH and biomass across treatments (strong in aggregate data; within some treatments, the relationship weakens or reverses when both nitrogen and lime are applied).
- Soil moisture tended to be negatively correlated with pH (r ≈ -0.68), separating wetter, more acidic plots from drier, limed plots.
- Overall, higher pH generally linked to higher productivity, but nuanced by treatment; particularly, plots with both N and lime showed altered (often weaker or non-linear) pH–biomass relationships.

### 3.4 Point Analysis survey
- Species hits: improved plots (limed and nitrogen-enhanced) showed higher relative abundances of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots favored Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Bryophytes: Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and other bryophytes increased across the site, especially in unimproved plots; bryophyte hits rose from 10.82% (2001) to 19.92% (2002).
- Diversity and structure:
  - Shannon Diversity Index: baseline differences non-significant in 1998 but differences emerged thereafter; 2002 showed a 15% decline in the N&L plots relative to the baseline, while other treatments increased (up to 29% in some insecticide plots).
- Functional groups (CSR framework):
  - Stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR) dominated the communities, with 69–95% of vascular plant hits within a single plot in various surveys.
  - By 2002: C-S-R species dominated in N&L plots; stress-tolerators expanded in unimproved plots; SR/CSR reduced in lime and insecticide plots.
- PCA and species composition:
  - PCA separated improved vs. unimproved plots; lime-treated plots clustered distinctly; some nitrogen-treated plots aligned with limed plots.
- Bryophytes and litter:
  - Bryophyte abundance continued to rise; litter hits increased in 2001–2002 across several treatments.
- Overall functional shifts:
  - Three main functional groups accounted for most hits; treatment differences within these groups became statistically significant by 2002, indicating strong treatment-driven shifts in community function and composition.

## Discussion: interpretation of the main drivers

- Mowing effect
  - Reduction of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis (>40% since 2000) occurred broadly across treatments, suggesting a site-wide response to mowing rather than a specific treatment.
  - Festuca rubra expanded, especially where lime or nitrogen were added, implying a shift toward more nutrient-responsive species under reduced disturbance and higher fertility.
  - Stress-tolerant species expanded across most plots, consistent with lower disturbance and changes in nutrient availability; bryophyte expansion linked with mowing height (~6 cm) and possible loss of grazing.
- Fertilisation effect
  - Nitrogen and lime consistently boosted productivity; combined N&L gave the strongest biomass increases, though signs of peak performance under high lime (pH near 7.0) and potential moisture limitation suggest possible future declines if pH continues to rise or moisture drops.
  - Higher pH favored C-S-R species, particularly with lime; nitrogen alone showed limited advantage for these groups.
  - 2002 results suggest a shift toward more competitive, fast-growing species in fertilised plots, with potential reductions in diversity in the short term.
- Insecticide effect
  - The link between insecticide application and diversity is not straightforward; the document notes that insect herbivory can interact with diversity in complex ways.
  - 2002 data hint that reduced herbivory could favor certain palatable species, potentially maintaining higher diversity if the infertile baseline remains, but evidence for a direct causal link remains cautious.
- Trampling effect
  - The introduction of labelled 13CO2 pulses in C2 plots (and associated activity) likely suppressed vegetation growth through trampling, contributing to the observed drop in productivity in those plots relative to C1.

## Practical implications

- Management choices (fertilisation and mowing) strongly shape productivity and plant community composition, with fertilisation promoting biomass but potentially reducing certain aspects of diversity over time.
- Lime-driven pH increases can enhance productivity but may interact with moisture and nutrient dynamics, requiring monitoring to avoid unintended stress.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are inconclusive; further targeted studies would be needed to isolate their influence from other site factors.
- Bryophyte expansion under mowing and absence of grazing indicates a broader shift in the vascular/bryophyte balance and may influence long-term sward structure and nutrient cycling.

- Data provenance and transparency are maintained with detailed site maps, treatments, and measurement methods, enabling reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
