# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Report from the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme detailing results from the Sourhope field experiment (Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders) for 1999–2001.
- Aims to provide a context for other research groups and enable year-to-year comparisons, following the Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998).
- Document covers management events in 2001 (FMD restrictions and staff change) and outlines measurement types, dates, and analysis approaches.

## Data Collected and Measurements
- Automatic Weather Station data (1999–2001): rainfall, radiation, average temperatures, soil moisture; site temperature profiles.
- Above-ground biomass:
  - Harvest schedule across May–Sep each year; five mowing occasions per year.
  - 0.5 m2 sampling cells within sub-plots; biomass dried and weighed; total annual biomass calculated and ln-transformed for analysis.
  - Normalization against a reference plot (C1) in 2001 due to methodological change (shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears).
- Soil pH (top 5 cm): measured to monitor liming and nitrogen effects.
- Botanical composition:
  - Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001; mirrored 2000 protocol): 100 cells per cell, 25 hits recorded per plot survey.
  - Species coded (e.g., Ac: Agrostis capillaris; Fo: Festuca ovina; Fr: Festuca rubra; etc.).
  - Inter-surveyor reliability tested (two surveyors; no significant difference observed).
  - Relative abundance (hits per species) and PCA to identify shifts in plant communities.
- Additional vegetation assessments:
  - Relative cover surveys around minirhizotron tubes; disturbance/nutrient plots surveys (as part of other projects).
- Data management and provenance:
  - Weather data downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager (CEH, Merlewood).
  - Acknowledgements note support from MLURI staff and data management processes.
- Site activity and data notes:
  - Tables list measurement dates, sampling events, and quantities (e.g., soil sampling counts, measurement counts) across 1998–2001.
  - Appendix 1 provides annualized above-ground biomass per plot.

## Experimental Design and Treatments
- Site design: multi-plot experiment with blocks and sub-plots; treatment matrix includes:
  - Control 1 (C1) and Control 2 (C2)
  - Nitrogen addition (N)
  - Lime addition (L)
  - Nitrogen and Lime combined (N&L)
  - Biocide treatment (B)
- Measurements linked to plot-level treatments to assess effects on biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community.

## Key Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data broadly unremarkable.
- Post-2000 wet year: 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar; slightly cooler temperatures; higher soil moisture vs previous year.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Clear hierarchical treatment effect on biomass across sampling period; peak biomass in July/August each year.
- 2001 showed a substantial biomass increase relative to previous years.
  - Likely due to changes in personnel and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Biomass analyses:
  - Across years, nitrogen and lime had positive effects on biomass; combined N&L often most effective.
  - ANOVA on log-transformed biomass indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Liming continued to raise soil pH (October 2001: limed plots ~6.19; N&L plots ~6.38).
- Nitrogen addition also raised soil pH modestly; control plots remained near baseline values (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat results showed:
  - No significant difference between surveyors in 2001 data.
  - 2001 hits were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting increased sward density (potentially from reduced grazing since 1998).
- Treatment effects on species composition:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. increased across treatments, especially F. ovina and F. rubra in fertilized plots.
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) more apparent in fertilized plots (notably N and/or L).
  - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
- Species diversity:
  - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in N&L plots (suggesting potential diversity decline with improvements).
- Multivariate analysis (PCA) indicated:
  - Clear separation between improved plots (N and/or L) and unimproved plots.
  - Unimproved plots associated with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Improved plots linked with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis.
- Biomass correlation with species abundance:
  - Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively correlated with biomass.
  - Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes tended to decline as biomass increased.
- Litter and turnover:
  - Increased litter in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F with more acidic plots, particularly in N and/or Lime plots (suggested but not definitive due to plot composition).
- Overall, pH and plant community composition show regional variation across the site.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass distribution showed spatial patterning:
  - Outlying plots (lower biomass) across treatments represented below-average sites.
  - Higher biomass tended to cluster in more central site locations (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.

## Data Governance and Metadata Considerations for Data Stewards
- Data provenance and methodology:
  - Document measurement methods, dates, and any changes (e.g., 2001 switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears) to enable proper interpretation and replication.
  - Record treatment codes, plot and block structure, and sub-plot design to ensure correct data merges across years.
- Data quality and consistency:
  - Include inter-surveyor reliability checks (as performed) and note any deviations or calibrations.
  - Maintain normalization approaches (e.g., biomass normalization to C1) and rationale for comparability across years.
- Data richness and integration:
  - Manage multi-dimensional data types (weather, biomass, soil chemistry, plant community composition) with consistent metadata schemas.
  - Capture spatial heterogeneity information (site columns, plot locations) to support spatial analyses and replication.
- Data access and provenance:
  - Maintain clear records of data management responsibilities (MLURI site data manager; CEH for weather data) and transfer workflows.
  - Provide Appendix-like data (e.g., Table 1 measurement schedules, Table 3 weather highlights, Table 4–6 biomass/species results) in a structured, machine-readable form alongside narrative summaries.
- Gaps and disruptions:
  - Note any data gaps or disruptions (e.g., FMD-related access restrictions, biocide application timing changes) and their potential impact on analyses.
- Documentation and reuse:
  - Link raw data to processed outputs (e.g., biomass totals, log-transformed results, PCA coordinates) with clear documentation to support reuse by other researchers or data users.

## Notable Context and Endnotes
- 2001 management was affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions, limiting site visitation Feb–May; procedures were adjusted and adhered to via protocol with veterinary oversight.
- There was a change in the site Officer in Charge in May 2001.
- Data interpretation is supported by multiple statistical approaches (ANOVA, Genstat 5, PCA) and cross-year comparisons (1999–2001).

## Summary for Data Stewards
- The Sourhope dataset comprises longitudinal, multi-modal measurements (climatic, soil, biomass, and botanical data) across several treatments and plot designs, with clear indicators of methodological changes and site heterogeneity.
- Ensuring data usability requires thorough metadata capturing measurement methods, treatment mappings, plot/topology, dates, and any methodological shifts (notably the 2001 switch to mechanical cutting).
- Data curation should emphasize cross-year comparability, documentation of spatial heterogeneity, and explicit handling of data gaps created by incident-driven disruptions.
- The dataset is suitable for analyzing effects of nitrogen and lime on biomass and plant community composition, soil pH dynamics, and the relationship between pH and biomass, as well as documenting site heterogeneity over time.
