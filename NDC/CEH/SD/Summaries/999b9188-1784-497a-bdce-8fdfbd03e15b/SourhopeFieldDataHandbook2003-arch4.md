# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Purpose: Long-term, multi-variable data on soil-vegetation interactions at Sourhope, focusing on blocks 4 and 5 and including Ecotron data; part of the Soil Biodiversity Programme and linked to ECN and SERAD Micronet efforts.
- Scope: Integrates site context, soil profiles, horizon-level chemistry, auger sampling, vegetation surveys, and experimental plots across replicated blocks to study soil–plant relationships and management responses.

## Data assets and structure (Key components in this document chunk)
- Site and block metadata
  - Block 4 and Block 5 details (grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material); information used to place soil and vegetation data in context.
- Soil profiles and horizons
  - Block 4: Horizons LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx with detailed descriptive morphology (color, texture, structure, roots, stones) and boundary types.
  - Block 5: Horizons LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with similar descriptive detail and presence of igneous stones.
- Soil analyses (per horizon)
  - Parameters: weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Data captured as MLURI barcodes linked to horizon IDs.
- Auger samples (Block 4 and Block 5)
  - Depth-integrated data for each auger sample: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH, and related soil properties.
- Vegetation surveys
  - Plot- and subplot-level species tallies, totals by plot, and occurrence of dominant species; block-wide patterns noted (e.g., edge effects, moister blocks).
- Ecotron soil site and data
  - Separate soil chemistry and vegetation survey data for Ecotron plot, with dedicated barcodes and metadata.
- Data governance and archiving
  - Centralized via MLURI; samples archived with -80°C storage; detailed appendices and site histories; emphasis on longitudinal analysis and discoverability.

## Data processing, quality, and interpretation
- Methods (as part of the broader dataset): Twinspan, National Vegetation Classification (NVC) matching, and indicator-species analyses used to relate soil horizons and treatments to vegetation communities.
- Data quality notes: incomplete sampling in some subplots/blocks; occasional missing measurements (e.g., Na in some horizons); emphasis on comparative rather than absolute interpretation for certain variables.
- Longitudinal value: dataset designed for multi-block, time-series analysis of soil–vegetation dynamics, responses to management (e.g., liming, nitrogen), and climate-related changes.

## Key findings (high-level, synthesis applicable to data leadership)
- Vegetation patterns: grasses dominate with variability across blocks; richness generally increases downslope; edge plots show distinct associations.
- Community classification: closest match to NVC U4d (Festuca ovina–Agrostis capillaris–Galium saxatile) with U5b as a moister-block alternative.
- Soil–vegetation linkages: horizon-specific properties (moisture, pH, organic matter) influence plant communities; long-term data enable assessment of management effects and indigenous vegetation roles in sustainable grazing systems.

## Practical implications for data leadership
- Robust, integrated data framework: combines soil chemistry, horizon morphology, auger data, and vegetation surveys across replicated blocks with clear metadata and archiving.
- Governance and accessibility: well-documented metadata, unique barcodes, and secure storage enable long-term reuse; potential for cross-project integration (ECN, SERAD).
- Standardization and discoverability: highlights the need for harmonized measurement protocols, consistent horizon naming, and centralized metadata schemas to facilitate multi-site, longitudinal analyses.

## Challenges and considerations for future work
- Data fragmentation and gaps: some subplots not sampled; missing measurements (e.g., Na in certain horizons) limit full comparability.
- Interoperability: ensure uniform metadata formats, units, and access permissions to support broader sharing within the data community.
- Continuity: maintain linkage between horizon data, auger samples, and vegetation surveys across blocks and years to maximize longitudinal insights.
