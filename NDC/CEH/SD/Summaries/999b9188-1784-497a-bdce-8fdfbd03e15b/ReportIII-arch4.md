# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and aims
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; large-field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Baseline data survey completed 1998; year-to-year monitoring to provide context and enable cross-study comparisons.
  - Measurements spanned 1999–2001 with a planned schedule to help researchers relate their data; included weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical surveys.
  - 2001 site management was affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (visitor access limited Feb–May) and a change of site officer; a biocide application in May was missed.

- Data streams and methods
  - Automatic Weather Station: headline measures (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground biomass: five mowing events per summer; biomass weights derived from 0.5 m2 sub-samples; results normalised to a reference plot (C1) to compare treatments.
  - Soil pH: upper 5 cm measured; lime and nitrogen treatments tracked pH changes.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001, same protocol as 2000) to assess species hits and relative abundance; species codes used for analysis; supplementary full plant surveys and minirhizotron studies in selected sub-plots.
  - Analysis: split-plot ANOVA; log transformations for biomass; Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for species data; cross-year correlations with biomass.

- Key results
  - Weather (2001)
    - Rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than in prior year.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Clear hierarchy among treatments; peak biomass in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass higher than previous years, likely due to change from manual cutting to mechanical shears and staff changes.
    - Nitrogen and/or Lime additions consistently boosted biomass versus unimproved plots; interaction between treatment and year significant; blocks showed no significant effect.
  - Soil pH
    - Lime raised soil pH persistently; October 2001 pH ≈ 6.19 in limed plots, ≈ 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots.
    - Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (1998).
  - Botanical composition
    - 58% more hits in 2001 than 2000, suggesting higher sward density (possible effect of reduced grazing since 1998).
    - Distinct species shifts by treatment:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments (less dominant in 2001).
      - Festuca spp. increased across treatments; pronounced in fertilised plots (Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina).
      - Improved plots commonly featured Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more prevalent in unimproved plots.
    - Diversity: 24 species in unimproved (Control/Biocide) versus 18 in Nitrogen+Lime plots, suggesting potential early biodiversity contraction with higher fertility plots.
    - PCA separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; litter frequency higher with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
    - Biomass correlates with certain species: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively linked to higher biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline as biomass increases.
  
- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
  - 3.1 pH and plant community variation across columns: columns E and F show more acidic plots; possible underlying spatial heterogeneity with more acidic plots associated with nitrogen and/or lime in certain columns.
  - 3.2 Biomass variation: outlier plots with low biomass exist across treatments; higher biomass tends to be in more central site plots; positive correlation observed between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences between blocks.

- Data quality and interpretation considerations
  - Sensor/method changes influence results (e.g., shift from manual to mechanical mowing); normalisation to C1 essential for cross-year comparability.
  - 2001 FMD restrictions and personnel changes impacted sampling and management; highlights need for detailed metadata on site conditions and equipment.
  - Inter-observer consistency confirmed for point quadrat surveys in 2001; substantial within-year replication and cross-year comparability supported by statistical analyses (Genstat ANOVA, PCA).
  - Spatial heterogeneity within the site underscores the importance of accounting for site structure (columns, blocks) in analyses and data governance.

- Practical implications for data leadership
  - Ensure rigorous metadata documentation for site conditions, equipment, and procedural changes to support cross-year analyses.
  - Implement standardized data collection and transformation protocols (e.g., normalisation against a reference plot, log-transformations for biomass) to enable reliable comparisons.
  - Capture and model site heterogeneity (spatial layout, column effects) as a core part of data architecture and analytics.
  - Integrate diverse data streams (weather, biomass, soil chemistry, vegetation surveys) using consistent identifiers and ontologies; plan for multi-disciplinary analyses (e.g., linking soil fertility to plant communities and productivity).
  - Document data quality checks, observer calibration, and any deviations from the planned schedule (e.g., missed applications) to preserve data integrity for future reuse.
