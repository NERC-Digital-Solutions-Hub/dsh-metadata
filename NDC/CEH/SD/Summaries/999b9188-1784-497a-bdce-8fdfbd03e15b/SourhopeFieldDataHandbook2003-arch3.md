# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- This excerpt provides multi-faceted environmental health data for the Sourhope field site, focusing on Rigg Foot blocks 4 and 5, plus ECOTRON plots. It covers detailed soil profiles, soil chemistry, auger samples, vegetation surveys, and site metadata, illustrating a comprehensive framework for monitoring soil-plant interactions under upland grassland conditions.

## Scope and data domains

- Soil profiles and horizons
  - Block 4: horizon sequences including LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx with descriptive soil textures and color/structure notes.
  - Block 5: horizon sequences including LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with detailed boundary descriptions.
- Soil chemistry and physics
  - Per-horizon analyses: weight, %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Auger samples (Block 4 and Block 5) with %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH measures.
  - Notable metrics include carbon and nitrogen content, base cation concentrations, moisture, organic matter indicators (LOI), and pH profiles.
- Vegetation surveys
  - Plot-level species presence and abundance indicators across blocks 4 and 5, including per-plot totals for major taxa.
  - Data entries show species counts and dominance indicators for each subplot/plot.
- Site metadata and governance
  - Site details (grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material) and associated soil subgroups.
  - Record-keeping identifiers (MLURI barcodes) and references to archived data, facilitating long-term data management.

## Sampling design and data structure

- Spatial organization
  - Blocks 4 and 5 within Sourhope, with multiple plots per block (e.g., 4A–4F, 5A–5F) and subplots where applicable.
- Depths and horizons
  - Depths range from 0 cm through deeper horizons (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg), with explicit depth intervals.
- Data types by component
  - Soil profiles: descriptive horizons, depth ranges, boundary characteristics.
  - Chemical/physical analyses: per-horizon measurements (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, LOI, moisture loss, pH).
  - Auger samples: repeated sub-sample measurements across six auger points per plot (A–F variants).
  - Vegetation: per-plot species lists and counts, totals per plot, and species-specific abundance indicators.
- Data provenance
  - MLURI barcodes accompany each horizon and sample, enabling traceability and re-analysis.
  - Data are grouped by block and plot, with ECOTRON plots included as a dedicated sub-component.

## ECOTRON and policy-relevant monitoring

- ECOTRON soil and vegetation data
  - ECOTRON PLOT: soil analyses (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2) and vegetation totals by subplots A–F.
  - ECOTRON imagery of plots A–F reflects multi-scale monitoring of soil-plant interactions under controlled or replicated conditions.
- Policy-relevant indicators
  - Soil fertility and carbon dynamics (N, C, LOI, C:N) across horizons and blocks.
  - base cation status (Ca, Mg, K, Na) and acidity (pH) profiles.
  - Vegetation composition and community structure across different plots, aiding interpretation of soil-plant response to site conditions and management history.

## Data management, governance, and accessibility

- Archiving and metadata
  - Detailed archival practices with MLURI barcodes and horizon/plot-level records.
  - Data intended for long-term storage in MLURI/CHE repositories, supporting reproducibility and policy evaluation.
- Metadata requirements
  - Rich horizon descriptions, depth intervals, and measurement methods support transparent data reuse and cross-site comparability.
- Data usability considerations
  - The granularity (horizon-level chemistry, auger samples, and plot-level vegetation) enables multi-scale analyses but requires careful data handling to align horizons, plots, and sampling dates.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation

- Comprehensive, multi-scale framework
  - Demonstrates how to integrate soil profile data, soil chemistry, and vegetation surveys into a coherent environmental health monitoring framework.
  - Facilitates evaluation of soil-plant dynamics across different blocks and plots, including ECOTRON plots, to inform land management and policy decisions.
- Indicator suite for upland grasslands
  - Vegetation indicators (dominant species, community patterns) paired with soil indicators (N, C, LOI, pH, base cations) provide a robust basis for assessing productivity, biodiversity, carbon dynamics, and soil health.
- Practical guidelines for data-driven decision making
  - Emphasizes the importance of horizon-level data, standardized measurements, and rigorous data governance to support policy scrutiny and transparent reporting to stakeholders.

## Notable data features and caveats

- High-granularity data
  - Per-horizon chemical/physical measurements and per-plot vegetation data enable nuanced analyses of micro-site variability.
- Gaps and variability
  - Some Na values are marked as missing in certain blocks; variability across horizons and blocks requires careful interpretation in cross-block analyses.
- Integration across components
  - Linkages between soil properties and vegetation composition are supported by the joint datasets (profile descriptions, auger samples, and vegetation surveys).
