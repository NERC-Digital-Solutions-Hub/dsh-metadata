# A high-resolution global dataset of topographic index

- A high-resolution global dataset of topographic index (GA2) designed for hydrological modelling.
- File: ga2_Global_15s_netcdf.zip containing a single GIS data layer in NetCDF format, CF conventions, intended for use as a topographic ancillary file for the TOPMODEL routing option within the JULES land surface model.
- Size: 11.0 GB; global coverage at 15 arc-second resolution.
- Only variable: the topographic index itself, computed with the standard GA2 algorithm with minor modifications aligned to a global DEM.
- The dataset is directly comparable to USGS HYDRO1k’s compound topographic index (30 arc-second).
- Included metadata and corner coordinates:
  - Upper Left: (-180.0000000, 86.1000000)
  - Lower Left: (-180.0000000, -56.3541678)
  - Upper Right: (180.0000029, 86.1000000)
  - Lower Right: (180.0000029, -56.3541678)
  - Center: (0.0000014, 14.8729161)
