# A high-resolution global dataset of topographic index

- Purpose and use: A global topographic index dataset intended as a topographic ancillary file for the TOPMODEL routing option within the JULES land surface model, supporting large-scale hydrological modelling.
- Content: A single variable (topographic index) dataset; global coverage; designed for comparison with USGS HYDRO1k at 30-second resolution.
- Format and standards: NetCDF format conforming to Climate and Forecast (CF) conventions; archived as a single GIS data layer.
- Resolution and size: 11.0 GB compressed file ga2_Global_15s_netcdf.zip; resolution of 15 arc-seconds.
- Source and processing: Generated from the GA2 program with minor modifications to align with a global DEM.
- Spatial metadata: Global extent with specified corner coordinates (Upper Left, Lower Left, Upper Right, Lower Right) and center coordinates provided; georeferenced in geographic coordinates.
- Data variable: The only variable in the file is the topographic index value.
- Compatibility: Directly comparable to the compound topographic index from HYDRO1k at 30 arc-second resolution; suitable as topographic ancillary data for hydrological models.
- Data management considerations: Datasets are typically stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals; there is emphasis on enabling access to underlying data and increasing dataset value by integrating with related data sources.
