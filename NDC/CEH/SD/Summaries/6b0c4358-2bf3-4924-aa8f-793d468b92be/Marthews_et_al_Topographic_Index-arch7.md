# A high-resolution global dataset of topographic index

- Purpose: A high-resolution global topographic index dataset intended as a topographic ancillary file for TOPMODEL routing in the JULES land surface model.
- Data specifics:
  - Single variable: the topographic index.
  - Calculated using the GA2 program; standard algorithm with minor modifications for global DEM.
  - Resolution: 15 arc-seconds (global).
  - File: 11.0 Gb; archived as ga2_Global_15s_netcdf.zip; NetCDF format conforming to CF conventions.
- Coverage and coordinates:
  - Global extent with corners:
    - Upper Left: (-180.0000000, 86.1000000)
    - Lower Left: (-180.0000000, -56.3541678)
    - Upper Right: (180.0000029, 86.1000000)
    - Lower Right: (180.0000029, -56.3541678)
  - Center: (0.0000014, 14.8729161)
- Data structure:
  - Only one variable in the file: the topographic index.
  - Directly comparable to USGS HYDRO1k compound topographic index at 30 arc-seconds.
- Usage notes:
  - Intended for hydrological modelling and GIS map-based analyses as an ancillary data layer.
  - CF-compliant NetCDF; suitable for integration into GIS and modelling workflows.
