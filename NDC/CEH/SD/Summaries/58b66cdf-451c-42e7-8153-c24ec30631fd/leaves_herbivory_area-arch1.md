# AFEX Experiment

## Site description
- Location: AFEX project area at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil (02°25' S, 59°43' W).
- Landscape: plateaus 80–160 m above sea level with steep slopes and valleys.
- Climate: average temperature ~26.7°C; mean annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm (peak >300 mm/month in April); dry period Jun–Oct (<100 mm/month); relative humidity 75–92% (min in August, max in April).

## Experimental setup - AFEX Experiment
- Design: full factorial nutrient addition experiment initiated May 2017.
- Treatments: eight treatments including untreated control and all combinations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and cations (K, Mg, Ca): N, P, Cations, N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations.
- Replication and layout: 4 replicates per treatment across 4 independent blocks (≥250 m apart), totaling 32 plots.
- Plot size and sampling area: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m to maximize litter from trees inside plots.
- Nutrient application rates (applied three times per year): N 125 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ (urea); P 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ (triple superphosphate); Ca 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹; Mg 20 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ (dolomitic limestone); K 50 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ (potassium chloride).

## Leaf area lost by herbivory
- Litter collection and scanning: litter from all treatments collected and scanned to determine area lost to herbivory; flat leaves scanned in the field using a Canon CanoScan LiDE 120.
- Sampling timeline: analyses conducted in August of 2017, 2018, and 2019 (peak litterfall); 160 littertraps sampled in total.
- Image analysis: Leaf area measured with ImageJ; areas without herbivory filled via gap filling to estimate potential herbivore-free leaf area.
- Measurements produced: 
  - Leaf_area_mm: mean area of leaves affected by herbivory (mm²).
  - Leaf_filled_area_mm: mean area of leaves with filled spaces projected (no herbivory) (mm²).
  - LMA_gm2: Leaf Mass per Area (g m⁻²).

## Data spreadsheet
- Column A - N: numeric identifier.
- Column B - TRT: treatment type (Seven Treatments plus Control listed; see note below).
- Column C - PlotID: Block (1–4) and Plot (1–8) indicating littertrap locations.
- Column D - Year: year of collection.
- Column E - Month: month of collection.
- Column F - Leaf_area_mm: mean area of herbivore-affected leaves (mm²).
- Column G - Leaf_filled_area_mm: mean area of herbivore-free leaves after filling (mm²).
- Column H - LMA_gm2: leaf mass per area (g m⁻²).

Note: while the design describes eight treatments, the data sheet caption refers to seven treatments plus Control.
