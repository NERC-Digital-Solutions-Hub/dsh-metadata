# AFEX Experiment

## Overview
- Full factorial nutrient addition experiment conducted in the AFEX project area of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), about 80 km north of Manaus, Brazil.
- Started in May 2017; eight treatments (control plus N, P, cations, and their combinations: N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations) with four replicates per treatment.
- 32 plots across four independent blocks (at least 250 m apart).
- Each plot measures 50 m x 50 m; central measurement area is 30 m x 30 m to maximize litter arising from trees inside plots.

## Experimental design and plot layout
- Treatments: control, N, P, cations (K, Mg, Ca), and all combinations (N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations).
- Replication: 4 replicates per treatment; 4 blocks.
- Measurements focused on the central 30 m x 30 m area within each 50 m x 50 m plot.

## Site description and climate
- Location: AFEX project area within BDFFP/INPA, near Manaus, Brazil (02°25' S, 59°43' W).
- Environment: plateaus 80–160 m a.s.l., steep slopes and valleys.
- Climate: average ~26.7°C; mean annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm (peak >300 mm/month in April; dry period <100 mm/month between June–October); relative humidity 75–92%.

## Leaf area herbivory measurement
- Litter from all treatments collected and scanned in the field using flat, moist leaves for complete area capture.
- Leaf area measured via Canon CanoScan LiDE 120; analysis conducted in August 2017, 2018, and 2019 (peak litterfall); 160 littertraps analyzed in total.
- Image analysis performed with ImageJ; leaf areas adjusted to represent leaves without herbivory by a gap-filling process.

## Data structure and processing
- Data spreadsheet columns:
  - A: N (numerical identifier)
  - B: TRT (treatments and control; 7 treatments plus control)
  - C: PlotID (block and plot location)
  - D: Year (collection year)
  - E: Month (collection month)
  - F: Leaf_area_mm (mean area on leaves considered herbivory, in mm²)
  - G: Leaf_filled_area_mm (mean area on leaves with filled spaces projected, in mm²)
  - H: LMA_gm2 (Leaf Mass per Area; g/m²)
- Data are combined across years to estimate overall herbivory across the year.
