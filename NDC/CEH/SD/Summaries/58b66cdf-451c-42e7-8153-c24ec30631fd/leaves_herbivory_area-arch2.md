# AFEX Experiment at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA)

- Purpose and context
  - Use standardized data to monitor environmental responses to nutrient additions in a tropical rainforest fragment system.
  - Focus on quantifying herbivory-related leaf area loss and related leaf traits to infer ecosystem-level impacts.

- Location and climate
  - AFEX project area, BDFFP/INPA, ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil.
  - Terrain: plateaus (80–160 m a.s.l.), slopes and valleys.
  - Climate: small seasonal temperature variation, mean ~26.7°C; annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm with a peak in April and a dry period June–October; relative humidity 75–92%.

- Experimental design (AFEX Experiment)
  - Full factorial nutrient addition setup starting May 2017.
  - Treatments: untreated control plus eight nutrient treatments (N; P; cations: K, Mg, Ca) and their combinations (N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations).
  - Structure: 32 plots total (4 replicates per treatment), arranged in four independent blocks with at least 250 m between blocks.
  - Plot layout: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m to maximize sampling from trees within plots.
  - Nutrient application rates (applied three times/year, avoiding main dry season): 125 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ N (as urea); 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ P (as triple superphosphate); 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ Ca; 20 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ Mg (as dolomitic limestone); 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ K (as potassium chloride).

- Leaf area loss by herbivory: data collection and processing
  - Litter from all treatments collected and scanned to determine leaf area (mm²).
  - Field method: flat leaves collected in conditions suitable for scanning; 160 littertraps sampled across all plots during peak litterfall (2017, 2018, 2019).
  - Imaging: Canon CanoScan LiDE 120 scanner.
  - Analysis: August 2017, 2018, 2019; leaf area measured with ImageJ; leaves with herbivory gaps filled to estimate potential area without herbivory.
  - Sampling approach aimed to represent realized herbivory across much of the year by pooling results from multiple time points.

- Data management and structure
  - Data processing: images converted to representative leaf areas; gap-filling to estimate herbivore-free area.
  - Data spreadsheet (columns described):
    - Column A: N (plot/n_trt identifier)
    - Column B: TRT (eight nutrient treatments plus control)
    - Column C: PlotID (Block number 1–4 and Plot number 1–8 within each block)
    - Column D: Year (collection year)
    - Column E: Month (collection month)
    - Column F: Leaf_area_mm (mean area of leaves considered herbivore-damaged, in mm²)
    - Column G: Leaf_filled_area_mm (mean area after gap-filling, no herbivory, in mm²)
    - Column H: LMA_gm2 (Leaf Mass per Area; g m⁻²)
  - Outputs are designed for standardised analysis and integration with other datasets.

- Outputs and relevance for environmental monitoring
  - Findings presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) suitable for policy and management scrutiny.
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals to ensure accessibility and reuse.

- Particular challenges and opportunities for analysts
  - Challenge: increasing the value of datasets by combining with other relevant data sources (avoiding single-use datasets).
  - Challenge: enabling broad access to underlying data used to produce final outputs.
