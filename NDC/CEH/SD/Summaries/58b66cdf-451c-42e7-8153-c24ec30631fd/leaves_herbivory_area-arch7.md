# AFEX Experiment at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA)

## Site context
- Location: AFEX project area, BDFFP/INPA, approx. 80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (02°25'00'' S; 59°43'00'' W).
- Environment: plateaued terrain with altitudes 80–160 m above sea level, steep slopes, and valleys.
- Climate: small seasonal temperature variation; average ~26.7°C; mean annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm (peak >300 mm/month in April; dry period <100 mm/month Jun–Oct); relative humidity 75–92% (min in Aug, max in Apr).

## Experimental design (AFEX Experiment)
- Design: full factorial nutrient addition with eight treatments plus control (N, P, cations [K, Mg, Ca] and all combinations N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations).
- Replication and layout: 8 treatments with 4 replicates each, arranged in 4 independent blocks (≥250 m apart); total of 32 plots.
- Plot and measurement area: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m to maximize litter sampled from trees within plots.
- Nutrient application: manual dry granules applied three times/year with rates—N 125 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (urea), P 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (triple superphosphate), Ca 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, Mg 20 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (dolomitic limestone), K 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (potassium chloride).

## Data collection: leaf area herbivory
- Litter collection: from all treatments; leaf areas scanned using Canon CanoScan LiDE 120; timing focused on August 2017, 2018, 2019 (peak litterfall); 160 littertraps sampled per time point.
- Processing: leaves scanned in-field, analyzed with ImageJ to estimate leaf area; gap filling used to estimate herbivore-free area (mm²).

## Data spreadsheet (structure and variables)
- Column A: N — sample number.
- Column B: TRT — treatment category (7 treatments + Control).
- Column C: PlotID — Block and Plot (e.g., Block-Plot) where littertraps are located.
- Column D: Year — year of collection.
- Column E: Month — month of collection.
- Column F: Leaf_area_mm — mean area of leaves considered herbivore (mm²).
- Column G: Leaf_filled_area_mm — mean area after gap-free projection (no herbivory) (mm²).
- Column H: LMA_gm2 — Leaf Mass per Area (g m⁻²), leaf dry mass per unit leaf area.

## GIS-usable insights and applications
- Spatial data structure: coordinates for blocks, plots, and littertraps; linkage to treatment and year.
- Visualization opportunities: map distributions of treatments, plot layouts, littertrap locations, and herbivory metrics.
- Temporal analysis: examine changes in herbivory and leaf-area metrics across 2017–2019 (peak litterfall) and across nutrient treatments.
- Data integration: align these plots with climate data, topography, and other ecological layers; address multi-resolution data (plot vs. littertrap scale).
