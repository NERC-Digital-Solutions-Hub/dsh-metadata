# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- Describe DNA extraction procedures for environmental samples (soil, water, stool) and bacterial isolates.
- Use Qiagen kits (PowerSoil, PowerWater, QIAamp Stool) and a template DNA preparation protocol.
- Provide steps to yield DNA suitable for downstream applications and storage guidance.

## General precautions
- Avoid skin contact with reagents; wear gloves and use universal precautions.
- Refer to Material Safety Data Sheets for emergency procedures; do not ingest reagents.
- Keep flammable reagents (e.g., ethanol) away from open flames/sparks.

## DNA extraction procedures by sample type

### Soil samples (DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit)
- Sample preparation: use 0.25 g soil in PowerBead Tube.
- Pre-processing: check Solution C1; heat to 60°C if precipitated; add Solution C1 and vortex.
- Lysis: vortex PowerBead Tubes at max speed for 10 minutes.
- Clarification: centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 seconds; transfer supernatant (avoid pellet).
- Purification: sequentially add C2, C3, and C4 with incubations and centrifugation; bind DNA through spin filter with C5 and centrifugation.
- Elution: add C6 (or sterile DNA-free water) and centrifuge to elute; store DNA frozen (-20 to -80°C).
- Notes: avoid exceeding 10,000 x g to prevent tube damage.

### Water samples (DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit)
- Pre-treatment: filter water; prepare filter in PowerWater Bead Tube; warm PW1 to dissolve precipitates.
- Lysis and binding: add PW1, vortex, then centrifuge; transfer supernatant to Collection Tube.
- Inhibition removal and purification: add IRS, PW3, and proceed with MB Spin Column bindings and washes (PW4, PW5).
- Elution: place MB Spin Column in collection tube; elute with PW6; store DNA frozen (-20 to -80°C).
- Notes: warm PW3 and PW1 as needed; follow centrifugation speeds per kit instructions.

### Stool samples (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit)
- Sample prep: weigh 180–220 mg stool; resuspend in Buffer ASL; vortex thoroughly; heat 70°C; centrifuge to pellet solids.
- Inhibitor removal: transfer supernatant; add InhibitEX Tablet; vortex and incubate to bind inhibitors; centrifuge to pellet inhibitors.
- Lysis: add Buffer AL and Proteinase K; incubate at 70°C; add ethanol.
- Binding and washing: apply lysate to QIAamp spin column; centrifuge; wash with AW1 and AW2.
- Elution: elute with Buffer AE; store DNA frozen (-20 to -80°C).

### Preparation of Template DNA
- From colony: transfer one loopful to 500 µl autoclaved water; vortex; boil 10 minutes; cool on ice 5–10 minutes.
- Clarify: centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 5 minutes; collect ~200 µl supernatant.
- Storage: store template DNA at -200°C (as stated in the document).

## Storage and handling of extracted DNA
- Recommended storage: frozen at -20°C to -80°C for all extracted DNA.
- Careful handling to avoid splashing or contamination during elution steps.

## Data and reproducibility notes (archetype perspective)
- Each protocol specifies kit names and catalog numbers, reagent names, specific volumes, times, temperatures, and centrifugal forces to enable reproducibility.
- Record-keeping recommendations implicit in the procedures: note lot numbers, kit versions, temperatures, and instrument settings; maintain clear chain-of-custody for samples and reagents.
- Storage conditions are explicitly stated to preserve DNA integrity for downstream data generation (e.g., sequencing, genotyping).
