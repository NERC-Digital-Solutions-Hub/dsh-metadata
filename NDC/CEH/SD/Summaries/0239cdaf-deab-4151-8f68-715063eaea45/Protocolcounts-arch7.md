# Antibiotic resistance and resistant genes in bacteria ( Escherichia coli ) from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Objective
- Assess presence and quantity of antibiotic-resistant E. coli and associated resistance genes (blaCTX-M-1, blaNDM-1) across humans, poultry, and the environment in Bangladesh.
- Determine resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics.

## Settings and sampling sites
- Rural households.
- Small-scale commercial poultry farms (broilers) in a rural area of Mirzapur, Tangail district.
- Urban food markets in Dhaka city.
- Sample types: humans (faecal), poultry (caecal), environment (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/faeces). Cattle faeces considered where available.

## Study design and timeline
- Baseline survey with no pre-specified effect size or sample-size calculation.
- Data collection rounds: winter 2017 (Feb–Apr) and summer 2017 (Aug–Oct).
- Additional water sampling in farms and urban markets in Oct 2018.
- Ethical approval and written informed consent obtained; participants could withdraw.

## Data collection and handling
- Field data collected by trained researchers from icddr,b and transported to the icddr,b laboratory.
- Data recorded on paper and/or automated laboratory outputs; digitised into Excel.
- Main dataset: Ecolicounts.csv; blank cells indicate missing data.

## Laboratory analysis
- Culture microbiology to identify E. coli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.
- DNA extraction from resistant E. coli; qPCR for blaCTX-M-1 and blaNDM-1.
- Standard operating procedures provided in supporting documentation.
- Analyses conducted by the Food and Enteric Microbiology Laboratory, icddr,b.

## Data quality and governance
- Manual data entries cross-checked against original data sheets by an independent data manager.
- Random and frequency checks used to identify and correct out-of-range or erroneous values.

## Data structure and documentation
- Primary file: Ecolicounts.csv.
- Supporting documentation includes:
  - Samplingstrategy.rtf
  - GISpHtempconductivity.rtf
  - Microbiology.rtf
  - Dnaextraction.rtf
  - QuantitativePCR.rtf
  - Variablelistcounts.csv

## GIS relevance and considerations
- Data span humans, poultry, and environmental samples across multiple locations, enabling spatial analysis of resistance prevalence and gene distribution.
- Current protocol notes do not specify geolocation data in the dataset; geospatial fields would be required to create map-based visualisations.
- Potential to integrate with environmental and water quality layers; data standardisation and resolution considerations are important for effective GIS products.
- Emphasises data cleaning and consistent metadata to support reliable GIS visualisations.
