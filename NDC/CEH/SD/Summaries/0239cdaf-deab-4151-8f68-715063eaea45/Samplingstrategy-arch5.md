# Purpose

- Describe the sampling strategy and procedures for collecting human faecal, poultry caecal, and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) for the Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh study.

## Overview of aims and scope

- Study contexts: urban live poultry markets, commercial poultry farms, and rural households with domestic poultry.
- Two sampling rounds: Round 1 in winter; Round 2 in summer.
- Sample types across settings include human faeces, poultry cloacal samples, poultry pen litter, animal manure, soil, solid waste, water (various sources), and downstream waters (ponds, rivers).

## Sampling design by site and round

- Urban poultry markets
  - Round 1: 20 markets randomly selected; at each market one live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder sampled.
  - Samples: human faecal samples; municipal drinking water; solid waste disposal sites; wastewater from drains; poultry cloacal samples; floors/surfaces of poultry pens.
  - Round 2: 20 additional markets; total 40 markets.
- Commercial poultry farms
  - Round 1: ~20 small-to-medium broiler farms; one farm worker per farm; one non-poultry-exposed adult from same village as low exposure group.
  - Samples: human faecal samples; farm drinking water; poultry caecal samples and mixed pen faeces; downstream wastewater; downstream pond/canal water; downstream river water.
  - Round 2: 20 additional farms; total 40.
- Rural villages
  - Round 1: 20 households (10 villages, 2 households per village): high exposure (owning poultry) and low exposure (not owning poultry) per village.
  - Samples: human faecal samples from adult women; tubewell drinking water; household soil; poultry caecal samples (poultry-owning households); animal manure; downstream freshwater ponds, wastewater, and downstream river water.
  - Round 2: 20 additional households from 10 more villages; total 40 households from 20 villages.

## Summary of collected samples (structure and exposure)

- Human faecal samples across rural households, farms, urban markets (high exposure) and low exposure groups.
- Poultry-related samples: cloacal swabs, poultry pen litter.
- Environmental and other samples: water supply (tubewell, tap), wastewater, pond water, downstream river water, soil from household compounds, animal manure, solid waste from market areas.
- Exposures are categorized as high or low depending on poultry contact or farm/market involvement; some sample types have missing exposure labels where not applicable.
- Total planned scope includes 40 urban markets, 40 farms, and 40 rural households (per Round 1 and Round 2 counts), resulting in multiple sample types per setting.

## Sample collection, handling, and transport

- All samples transported on ice and processed in the laboratory within 12 hours (faecal/caecal-related samples) or 24 hours (environmental samples) of collection.
- For environmental and field sampling, sterile technique and appropriate PPE used; samples pooled where specified (e.g., wastewater, river/pond water, soil, and litter pools).
- GPS and basic metadata
  - GPS coordinates of downstream river sample locations recorded.
  - Environmental metadata: pH, temperature, conductivity recorded for downstream river locations.

## Specific sampling procedures (highlights by sample type)

- Soil
  - Sample from yard area with frequent movement (e.g., near kitchen).
  - Collect ~20 g soil; store on ice.
  - Small sub-sample (~0.25 g) placed in LifeGuard solution; keep on ice.
- Solid waste
  - Collect from waste dumping areas near markets from three locations; pool ~20 g; mix thoroughly.
  - Place in sterile bag; keep cool.
- Waste water
  - Collect ~150 ml from three drain locations; pool into a 500 ml sterile bottle; keep cool.
- River/pond/surface water
  - Collect 500 ml by submerging sterile bottle ~30 cm below surface; seal and keep cool.
- Drinking water (tubewell and tap)
  - Tubewell: pump for 5 minutes and discard initial flow; collect 500 ml aseptically from steady flow; keep cool.
  - Tap: flush 1 minute; sterilize nozzle with flame; collect 500 ml; keep cool.
- Human stool
  - Provide container; collect within 2 hours of defecation; store on ice.
- Poultry pen litter
  - Collect from three areas of the floor; pool ~20 g; mix; keep on ice.
- Animal manure
  - Collect ~20 g fresh manure; use sterile bag; keep on ice.
- Poultry caecal samples
  - From randomly selected chickens at slaughter; caecal samples extracted and processed in lab; whole carcass transported in sterile bag.

## Documentation and data governance notes for Data Stewards

- Data capture aligns with a multi-site, multi-round study design; explicit tracking of site type, exposure level, and sample type per participant/unit.
- Standardized, sterile collection and handling protocols, with clear labeling and cold-chain requirements to ensure data integrity.
- Metadata captured includes location (GPS for river sites) and basic environmental parameters (pH, temperature, conductivity) where applicable.
- Timelines are defined for processing windows (12 hours for some samples; 24 hours for others); sample handling is designed to support reproducibility and comparability across sites and rounds.
