# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- Describe procedures for DNA extraction from environmental samples (soil, water, stool) and from bacterial isolates obtained in the study.
- Document specific kit-based methods (and a heat-lysis alternative) to ensure consistent DNA recovery for downstream analyses.

## Kits and general approach
- Soil: DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN; Catalog No. 12888-50).
- Water: DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN; Catalog No. 14900-5-NF).
- Stool: QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN; Catalog No. 51504).
- Bacterial isolates: Heat-lysis DNA extraction method.
- General precautions and storage for kits and reagents (room temperature storage for reagents; DNA storage at -20°C to -80°C).

## Equipment and preparatory notes
- Required: Pipettors (50 μl–500 μl), microcentrifuges (up to 13,000–15,000 x g depending on kit), vortex mixer, spin filters, and compatible collection tubes.
- Safety: Follow universal precautions; consult MSDS for emergency procedures; manage flammable reagents away from flames.
- Quality/consistency intent: Prescribed volumes, times, and g-forces to ensure reproducible DNA recovery and suitability for downstream applications.

## DNA extraction from soil samples (PowerSoil kit)
- Sample prep: Add 0.25 g soil to PowerBead Tubes; vortex; ensure Solution C1 is dissolved if precipitated.
- Lysis and clarification: Add C1, vortex; centrifuge at 10,000 x g (30 s); transfer supernatant.
- Binding and washing: Sequentially add C2, C3, C4 with specified incubations and transfers; apply to Spin Filter; perform multiple centrifugation steps.
- Elution: Add Solution C6 (or DNA-Free Water) to the filter; centrifuge to elute DNA.
- Storage: Store extracted DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C).

## DNA extraction from water samples (PowerWater kit)
- Preparation: Filter water samples; prepare filter in PowerWater Bead Tube; warm PW1 and PW3 as needed to dissolve precipitates; shake PW4 before use.
- Lysis and binding: Add PW1, vortex; centrifuge; transfer supernatant; proceed through PW2–PW6 steps with spin-filter-based purification.
- Elution: DNA eluted from the MB Spin Column with PW6.
- Storage: Store DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C).

## DNA extraction from stool samples (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit)
- Initial processing: Weigh 180–220 mg stool; add Buffer ASL; vortex thoroughly; heat at 70°C; centrifuge to pellet solids.
- Inhibitor removal: Add InhibitEX Tablet, vortex, incubate to adsorb inhibitors; centrifuge to remove pellet.
- Lysis: Add proteinase K and Buffer AL; incubate at 70°C; add ethanol; apply lysate to QIAamp spin column with AW1 and AW2 washes.
- Elution: Elute DNA with Buffer AE; store frozen.

## Preparation of Template DNA
- From culture: Resuspend one loopful from TSA plate in autoclaved water; boil 10 min, place on ice 5–10 min; centrifuge to collect supernatant; store at -20°C to -80°C for later use.

## Storage of DNA
- Across methods: Store extracted DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C).

## Practical considerations for environmental health monitoring
- Standardization: Use of kit-specific protocols and catalog numbers supports comparability across monitoring programs and timepoints.
- Data quality and usability: Explicit volumes, temperatures, centrifugation forces, and incubation times aid reproducibility and downstream data interpretation.
- Inhibitor management: In stool samples, InhibitEX and related steps highlight the need to address potential inhibitors to ensure reliable DNA recovery.
- Data governance and transparency: Documentation of exact procedures and reagents facilitates auditability and method sharing across monitoring bodies.

## Safety and handling notes
- PPE and universal precautions required throughout; consult MSDS for emergencies.
- Manage flammable reagents appropriately; avoid ingestion and skin contact with kit reagents.
