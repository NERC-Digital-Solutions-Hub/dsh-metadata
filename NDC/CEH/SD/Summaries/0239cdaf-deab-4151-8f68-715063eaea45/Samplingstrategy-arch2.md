# Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh

## Objective
- Describe the sampling strategy and procedures for collecting human faecal, poultry caecal, and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) to study AMR transmission in urban and rural Bangladesh.

## Study design and rounds
- Two sampling rounds: Round 1 conducted in winter; Round 2 in summer.
- Sites and groups:
  - Urban live poultry markets: sampling of market vendors, market environmental samples.
  - Commercial poultry farms: sampling of farm workers (high exposure) and a low-exposure non-poultry village member.
  - Rural households with domestic poultry: sampling of high exposure (poultry-owning households) and low exposure (non-poultry households).
- Each site type recruited across two rounds, enabling temporal analysis.

## Sampling sites and participants
- Urban poultry markets
  - 20 markets in Round 1; 20 additional markets in Round 2 (total 40 markets).
  - For each market: one live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder sampled; human faecal samples collected.
  - Environmental samples: municipal water supply (drinking water), solid waste disposal sites, liquid waste from municipal drains downstream of markets; poultry cloacal samples and samples from floors/surfaces of poultry pens.
- Commercial poultry farms
  - 20 farms in Round 1; 20 additional farms in Round 2 (total 40 farms).
  - Within farms: faecal samples from humans; drinking water supply; poultry caecal samples; mixed faeces within pens; downstream wastewater, downstream pond/canal water, downstream rivers.
  - High-exposure group: farm workers; low-exposure group: village residents not working in the poultry sector.
- Rural villages/households
  - 20 households from 10 villages in Mirzapur in Round 1; 20 more households from 10 new villages in Round 2 (total 40 households).
  - In each village: one high-exposure (poultry-owning) household and one low-exposure (non-poultry) household.
  - For rural households: faecal samples from adult women; environmental samples (tubewell drinking water, household soil); poultry caecal samples (from poultry-owning households); animal manure; downstream freshwater ponds, wastewater, downstream river water.

## Summary of sample types and exposure groups
- High exposure vs low exposure across settings:
  - Rural households: human faecal, poultry caecal (where applicable), soil, animal manure, tubewell water, downstream water bodies.
  - Farms: human faecal, poultry caecal, mixed pen faeces, drinking water, downstream environmental waters.
  - Urban markets: human faecal, poultry cloacal, poultry pen surfaces, market water and waste streams, downstream waters.
- Categories include a wide range of environmental matrices: water (tubewell, supply water, wastewater, pond/river), soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter, solid waste, and poultry-derived samples.

## Sample collection procedures and handling
- General handling
  - All samples collected with new gloves; sterile containers and spatulas/spoons used; samples pooled when specified; samples placed in sterile bags or bottles.
  - Immediate processing or storage on ice; transport to laboratory on ice; processing within 12–24 hours of collection.
  - When applicable, only one sample per market where water/waste facilities were shared.
- Specific sample procedures
  - Soil (household yards)
    - Collect ~20 g from near high-traffic areas (e.g., kitchen/front door) using autoclaved tools; depth ~0.5 inch; store on ice; preserve a portion in LifeGuard solution in an eppendorf.
  - Solid waste (market dumping areas)
    - Collect from three locations; pool ~20 g; mix thoroughly; store on ice; avoid sharp objects.
  - Waste water (drain runoff)
    - Collect ~150 ml from three locations; pool into a 500 ml sterile bottle; store on ice.
  - River/pond/surface water
    - Collect 500 ml by plunging sterile bottle ~30 cm below surface; seal; store on ice.
  - Tubewell water
    - Pump 5 minutes to waste; collect 500 ml aseptically; store on ice.
  - Tap water
    - Run tap 1 minute to waste; flame sterilize outside nozzle; fill 500 ml; store on ice.
  - Human stool
    - Provide container; collect within 2 hours of defecation; store on ice.
  - Poultry pen litter
    - Collect from three areas; pool ~20 g; mix thoroughly; store on ice.
  - Animal manure
    - Collect ~20 g fresh manure with sterile spoon; store on ice.
  - Poultry caecal samples
    - Randomly select slaughtered chickens; extract caecal sample and process in the lab.
- Documentation and coordinates
  - GPS coordinates recorded for downstream river water locations; field measurements include pH, temperature, and conductivity where applicable.

## Data quality, accessibility, and monitoring considerations
- Data are gathered across standardized environments and time points (two seasons) to enable robust temporal monitoring of AMR dynamics.
- Standardized collection and transportation procedures support comparability across sites and rounds.
- Environmental and human data are integrated to assess links between environmental reservoirs and human exposure.
- The plan emphasizes data value through consistent methodologies and potential for sharing underlying data and datasets for broader monitoring and policy assessment.
