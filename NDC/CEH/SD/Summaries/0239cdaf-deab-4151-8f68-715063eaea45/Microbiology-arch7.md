# Procedure for enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates NERC project NE/N019555/1

- Purpose
  - Describes the procedure to enumerate, isolate, preserve, and identify E. coli isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporins or carbapenems from study samples.

- Materials and Equipment (representative items)
  - PBS solution; cefotaxime; meropenem
  - CHROMagar ESBL media; CHROMagar KPC media; MacConkey media
  - TBX medium; TSB with 30% glycerol; LifeGuard Soil Preservation solution
  - Oxidase reagent; filter paper; sterile Petri dishes; weighing dishes; test tubes; cryovials; media bottles; inoculation loop
  - Lab equipment: refrigerator (2–8 °C); freezer (-20 °C, -80 °C); autoclave; water bath; incubator (36 ± 2 °C); shaker

- Media Preparation (high-level)
  - Prepare 1 L of 10× PBS, then dilute to 1× PBS; autoclave.
  - Prepare 1 L CHROMagar ESBL and 1 L CHROMagar KPC media; autoclave; cool to 45–50 °C; add supplements; pour into plates; store protected from light.
  - Prepare 1 L TBX media; autoclave; cool to 45–50 °C; dispense into plates; store protected from light.
  - Prepare MacConkey media with cefotaxime (1 mg/L) and MacConkey media with meropenem (0.5 mg/L); autoclave; prepare antibiotic stock solutions; add to cooled media; pour into plates.
  - Prepare plates in a manner allowing for plating and storage up to specified durations.

- Sample Types
  - Fecal (human and poultry); solid waste; soil
  - Suppy water (tap or tubewell water)
  - Waste water

- Sample Processing and Recovery Workflow
  - For fecal/solid soil samples:
    - Weigh 1–5 g sample; suspend in 9–45 mL sterile PBS.
    - Vortex 1 min; let settle 15 min; collect 1 mL of suspension; prepare serial dilutions in PBS.
    - Inoculate 0.1 mL of each dilution onto one CHROMagar ESBL plate, one CHROMagar KPC plate, and one TBX plate; incubate at 37 °C for 18–24 h.
    - Identify typical E. coli colonies (dark pink to reddish on ESBL and KPC plates).
    - Pick at least 3 isolated colonies from ESBL plate; subculture onto MacConkey agar with cefotaxime.
    - Pick at least 3 isolated colonies from KPC plate; subculture onto MacConkey agar with meropenem.
    - Prepare a culture sweep from the MacConkey plate; suspend in TSB with 30% glycerol; store at -80 °C.
  - For supply water:
    - Filter 2 × 100 mL of water through 0.22 μm membranes; place filters on two mTEC plates (one with cefotaxime, one with meropenem).
    - Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h, then 44 °C for 18 h.
    - If colony counts >200 CFU, perform appropriate dilutions the next day and repeat plating.
    - Count reddish-purple/magenta colonies typical of E. coli; pick at least 3 isolates; subculture onto MacConkey with the same antibiotics; store glycerol suspensions at -80 °C.
  - For waste water:
    - Prepare 9-fold dilutions of 20 mL waste water in NS.
    - Filter 2 × 100 mL as above; incubate on cefotaxime- and meropenem-supplemented mTEC plates (37 °C for 2 h, then 44 °C for 18 h).
    - Count colonies; pick at least 3 isolates per sample; subculture onto MacConkey with the same antibiotics; store glycerol suspensions at -80 °C.

- Confirmation of E. coli using API 20E
  - One E. coli isolate per sample is tested with API 20E for confirmation and for further genetic analysis; if a sample’s presumptive E. coli is negative, a second isolate from that sample is tested.
  - API 20E procedure (high-level)
    - Oxidase test: perform on a colony; oxidase negative for Enterobacteriaceae.
    - Prepare bacterial suspension in saline; inoculate API-20E strip wells and fill relevant tubes/cupules; create anaerobic environment for specified tests as instructed.
    - Incubate at 36 ± 2 °C for 18–24 h (extend to 42–48 h if needed).
    - Read results using the Reading Table; record observations.
    - If fewer than 3 positive tests, incubate an additional 24 h and re-evaluate.
    - If unidentifiable, perform additional tests (Nitrate Reduction including NIT tests; growth on MacConkey; and use of supplementary reagents).
  - Identification and follow-up
    - Identify organism via API-20E using online reference.
    - If unidentifiable, perform additional biochemical tests as specified.

- Data and Outputs Relevant to GIS
  - Sample and isolate identifiers (sample ID, colony/ isolate ID, date, plate type, antibiotic condition)
  - Quantitative results: colony counts per plate/type; CFU determinations for water/wastewater samples
  - Confirmation results: API 20E outcome for each tested isolate
  - Antibiotic resistance indicators: ESBL (cefotaxime) and KPC (meropenem) presence
  - Isolate preservation: glycerol stocks stored at -80 °C; record storage location and date
  - Metadata suitable for GIS mapping: sampling location, sample type, collection date, processing method, and plate/isolate lineage
  - Data quality and traceability notes: replicate testing if needed; documentation of supplementary tests if API 20E is inconclusive

- Quality Control and Notes
  - Reagents and supplement solutions prepared fresh; use the same day; do not reuse supplements
  - Some steps require careful temperature control (45–50 °C for media, 37 °C incubation, 44 °C final incubation)
  - For API 20E, if initial results are inconclusive, perform additional testing and confirm with a second isolate if necessary
