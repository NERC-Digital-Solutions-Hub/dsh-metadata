# Procedure for enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates NERC project NE/N019555/1

- Purpose
  - Describe the enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporin or carbapenem from study samples.

- Samples and workflow overview
  - Works with fecal (human and poultry), solid waste, soil, water (supply and wastewater) samples.
  - Initial isolation on selective/chromogenic media; subculture to confirm resistance; preserve isolates at -80°C; confirm identity with API 20E and further genetic analyses as needed.

- Key reagents and media (preparation and storage)
  - PBS solutions (1 L 10× PBS and 1 L 1× PBS)
  - Chromogenic media
    - CHROMagar ESBL (1 L yields ~50 plates)
    - CHROMagar KPC (1 L yields ~50 plates)
  - TBX medium (1 L yields ~50 plates)
  - MacConkey agar with antibiotics
    - MacConkey + cefotaxime (1 mg/L)
    - MacConkey + meropenem (0.5 mg/L)
  - Glycerol–TSB preservation solution (TSB with 30% glycerol)
  - Filterable and plating supplies
  - Antibiotic stock solutions and supplementation procedures
  - 0.22 µm cellulose membrane filters for water testing
  - mTEC agar plates (with antibiotics)
  - API 20E identification kit and oxidase test reagents

- Media preparation details (highlights)
  - 1 L 10× PBS: dissolve salts in 800 mL water, adjust to pH 7.4, bring to 1 L; autoclave; dilute to 1× with 100 mL 10× PBS.
  - CHROMagar ESBL and CHROMagar KPC: prepare 1 L media, sterilize, cool to 45–50°C, add appropriate supplement solutions (freshly prepared, use the same day), cast into plates; store plates in dark, usable for up to 1 day at room temp or up to 1 month at 2–8°C protected from light.
  - TBX medium: prepare per instructions, sterilize, cool to 45–50°C, dispense 20 mL per plate; store at 4°C for up to 4 weeks.
  - MacConkey with antibiotics: prepare base MacConkey, sterilize, cool to 45–50°C, add antibiotic stock to achieve desired concentrations, pour 20 mL per plate; store as above.

- Sample processing and initial isolation
  - Fecal, solid waste, and soil samples
    - Weigh 1–5 g, suspend in 9–45 mL sterile PBS, vortex 1 min, allow 15 min settling.
    - Use 1 mL of suspension for serial dilutions in PBS.
    - Inoculate 0.1 mL of each dilution onto CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar KPC, and TBX plates (spread plating).
    - Incubate at 37°C for 18–24 h.
    - Count presumptive E. coli colonies (dark pink to reddish on plates).
    - Subculture at least 3 isolated colonies from ESBL plate to MacConkey agar with cefotaxime; similarly from KPC plate to MacConkey with meropenem.
    - Prepare a culture sweep from MacConkey plate and suspend in TSB with 30% glycerol; store at -80°C.
  - Tap/tubewell water
    - Pass 2×100 mL water through two 0.22 µm filters; place filters on two mTEC plates (one with cefotaxime 1 mg/L, one with meropenem 0.5 mg/L).
    - Incubate: initial 2 h at 37°C, then 18 h at 44°C.
    - Keep any leftover water at 4°C; if colonies >200 CFU, perform follow-up dilutions and repeat incubation.
    - Count reddish-purple/magenta E. coli-like colonies; pick at least 3 isolates per sample onto MacConkey with corresponding antibiotic; store glycerol suspension as above.
  - Wastewater
    - Take 20 mL wastewater; prepare 9-fold dilutions in NS.
    - Filter through 0.22 µm membranes onto mTEC plates with cefotaxime (1 mg/L) and meropenem (0.5 mg/L); incubate as above (37°C 2 h then 44°C 18 h).
    - Follow as for tap water for colony handling and preservation.

- Confirmation of E. coli (API 20E)
  - One E. coli isolate from each sample will be tested with API 20E; if the presumptive isolate is negative, a second isolate from the same sample will be tested.
  - API 20E workflow
    - Oxidase test: place colony on filter paper, apply oxidase reagent; purple/black indicates positive (Enterobacteriaceae typically oxidase negative).
    - Prepare bacterial suspension from an agar plate; inoculate API strip wells (including CIT, VP, GEL as indicated) and fill with mineral oil where required to create anaerobic conditions.
    - Incubate at 36 ± 2°C for 18–24 h.
    - Read results using the API Reading Table; record observations.
    - If fewer than 3 positive tests after incubation, incubate an additional 24 hours and re-read.
    - For first-time reagents, follow specific handling steps for opening ampules and transferring reagents; use API web for organism identification.
  - If API 20E identification is unclear
    - Perform additional tests as needed (examples: Nitrate Reduction Test, MacConkey growth patterns) and interpret results per standard guidelines.

- Interpretation and follow-up
  - Use API-20E results with online database to identify organism.
  - If unidentifiable, conduct supplementary biochemical tests (as described) to reach a confident ID.
  - Maintain and track isolates with corresponding sample metadata and preparatory data.

- Data handling and references
  - Preserve and document data, including colony counts, isolate IDs, and API results.
