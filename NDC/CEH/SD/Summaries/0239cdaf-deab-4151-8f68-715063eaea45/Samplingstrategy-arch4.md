# Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh

- Purpose
  - Describe the sampling strategy and procedures for collecting human faecal, poultry caecal, and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) for the AMR transmission study in urban and rural Bangladesh.

- Study settings and rounds
  - Urban live poultry markets
    - Round 1: 20 markets (randomly selected); one live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder per market; samples from human participants, municipal drinking water, market waste streams, poultry cloacal samples, and floor/surface poultry pens.
    - Round 2: 20 additional markets; procedures repeated; total 40 markets included.
  - Commercial poultry farms
    - Round 1: 20 farms selected; at least one farm worker per farm; high-exposure group is the farm worker; low-exposure is a village resident not in poultry work; samples from humans, drinking water, poultry caecal contents, mixed pen feces, downstream waste streams (water and rivers).
    - Round 2: 20 additional farms; total 40 farms included.
  - Rural villages (Mirzapur)
    - Round 1: 20 households (10 villages, two households per village); one high-exposure household (owning poultry) and one low-exposure household (no poultry) per village; samples from adult women, tubewell water, soil around compounds, poultry caecal samples (where poultry is owned), animal manure; downstream river and pond/wastewater.
    - Round 2: 20 additional households from 10 new villages; total 40 households across 20 villages.
  - Overall sampling plan (N)
    - Urban markets: 40 markets total; high exposure (live poultry markets) vs low exposure (fruit/vegetable stalls).
    - Farms: 40 farms total; high exposure (commercial poultry farm) vs low exposure (non-farm workers).
    - Rural households: 40 households total; high exposure (with poultry) vs low exposure (without poultry).

- Summary of samples collected
  - Human samples: faecal samples from participants across all settings (markets, farms, rural households).
  - Poultry samples: cloacal samples and poultry pen litter from urban markets and farms; caecal samples from chickens processed onsite.
  - Environmental and other samples by setting: soil, animal manure, solid waste, water (drinking water, wastewater, pond water, river downstream water, tubewell water, tap water).
  - Exposure contrasts: high-exposure groups (with poultry or live poultry market exposure) and low-exposure groups (without poultry or non-poultry workers) included to compare AMR indicators.
  - Sampling scale: multiple sample types collected per unit/location, with some samples pooled (e.g., wastewater, water from multiple locations) and others collected per unit.

- Data collection and handling specifics
  - Sample transport and processing
    - All samples transported on ice and processed in the laboratory within 12–24 hours of collection.
  - Metadata and measurements
    - For downstream river sample locations: GPS coordinates recorded.
    - Environmental measurements: pH, temperature, and conductivity recorded where applicable.

- Key collection protocols (sample types and procedures)
  - Soil
    - Collect ~20 g from a yard area with a new glove; use autoclaved spoon; place in sterile bag; store on ice; collect additional small soil aliquot in LifeGuard solution and keep on ice.
  - Solid waste
    - From market waste sites; collect from three locations; pool ~20 g in a sterile bag; mix thoroughly; avoid sharp objects; keep on ice.
  - Waste water
    - Collect ~150 ml from three drain locations; pool into 500 ml sterile bottle; keep on ice; transport to lab.
  - River/pond/surface water
    - Collect 500 ml by submerging sterile bottle ~30 cm below surface; cap tightly; place on ice; transport.
  - Water supply/tubewell water
    - For tubewell: pump 5 minutes; heat pump mouth; sample 500 ml aseptically into sterile bottle; keep cool; transport.
  - Tap water
    - Clean nozzle with 70% alcohol; run water for 1 minute to waste; flame sterilize outside; collect 500 ml; keep on ice; transport.
  - Human stool
    - Provide stool container; field staff collect within 2 hours of collection; store on ice.
  - Poultry pen litter
    - Collect from three floor areas; pool ~20 g in sterile bag; mix thoroughly; remove sharp objects; store on ice.
  - Animal manure
    - Collect ~20 g fresh manure with new gloves; store on ice.
  - Poultry caecal samples
    - From slaughtered chickens of mixed ages and sexes; caecal samples extracted on-site and processed in the lab.

- Data governance and operational notes for Data Leaders
  - Two-round design to capture seasonal (winter vs summer) dynamics and to broaden geographic coverage.
  - Standardized, cross-setting data collection aimed at enabling comparative AMR analyses across urban markets, farms, and rural households.
  - Emphasis on data quality through consistent sampling methods, strict handling procedures, and timely laboratory processing.
  - Comprehensive metadata collection (locations, exposure status, sample type, processing timelines) to facilitate traceability and data integration across sites.
