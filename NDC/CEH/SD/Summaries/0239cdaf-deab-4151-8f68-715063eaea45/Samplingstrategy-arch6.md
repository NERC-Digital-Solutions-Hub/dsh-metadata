# Sampling plan and procedure for sample collection NERC study NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- Describe the sampling strategy and procedures for human faecal, poultry caecal, and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) in the AMR transmission study in urban and rural Bangladesh.

## Study design and scope
- Settings:
  - Urban live poultry markets
  - Commercial poultry farms
  - Rural households with domestic poultry
- Rounds:
  - Round 1 conducted in winter
  - Round 2 conducted in summer
- Sample types across settings include human faeces, poultry cloacal swabs, poultry pen litter, drinking water, wastewater, pond water, river water, soil, animal manure, solid waste, and downstream water samples.
- Exposure design (rural households and markets/farms): high exposure groups (with poultry or owning poultry) and low exposure groups (without poultry or non-farm workers).
- Scale (per setting):
  - Urban markets: 40 markets total (20 in Round 1, 20 in Round 2)
  - Commercial farms: 40 farms total (20 in Round 1, 20 in Round 2)
  - Rural households: 40 households total (20 per Round; 10 villages per round)

## Sampling plan by setting

- Urban poultry markets
  - Round 1: Randomly select 20 markets; sample one live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder per market; collect human faecal samples; environmental samples from municipal drinking water, solid waste disposal sites, and wastewater downstream of markets; poultry cloacal samples; floors and surfaces of poultry pens.
  - Round 2: Repeat with 20 additional markets not in Round 1.
- Commercial poultry farms
  - Round 1: 20 small-to-medium broiler farms; include at least one farm worker per farm and a village-based low-exposure adult; collect human faecal samples; samples from drinking water, poultry caecal and mixed pen faeces; downstream wastewater, pond/canal water, and downstream river water.
  - Round 2: Repeat with 20 additional farms not in Round 1.
- Rural villages (households)
  - Round 1: 20 households from 10 villages (two per village); include one high-exposure poultry-owning household and one low-exposure household per village; collect human faecal samples from adult women; environmental samples (tubewell drinking water, household soil); poultry caecal samples from poultry-owning households; animal manure; downstream samples from freshwater ponds, wastewater, and downstream river water.
  - Round 2: Repeat with 20 additional households from 10 new villages.

## Summary of sample types and exposure groups
- Human faecal samples
  - Rural households: high exposure (with poultry) and low exposure (without poultry)
  - Farms: high exposure (farm workers) and low exposure (non-farm workers)
  - Urban markets: high exposure (market stalls) and low exposure (fruit/vegetable stalls)
- Poultry samples
  - Cloacal samples from poultry in markets, farms, and rural households with poultry
  - Poultry pen litter in farms and markets; environmental exposure context
- Drinking water and wastewater
  - Water supply (tubewell, market water), tap water, waste water downstream of sites
- Environmental and other samples
  - Soil from household compounds and market/farm surroundings
  - Animal manure (from rural households and farms)
  - Solid waste from market areas
  - Pond water and downstream river water

## Procedures and handling

- General handling
  - Use new gloves for each sample where specified
  - Pool samples as required and mix thoroughly; avoid sharp objects in pooled samples
  - Store samples on ice and transport to laboratory
  - Process all samples in the laboratory within 12–24 hours of collection, depending on sample type
- Specific collection methods
  - Soil: collect ~20 g from areas with high foot traffic (e.g., near kitchen/door), autoclaved tools, store on ice; preserve a portion in LifeGuard solution
  - Solid waste: collect ~20 g from three locations around market dustbins, pool and mix thoroughly; store on ice
  - Waste water: collect from three runoff locations (≈150 ml each), pool into a 500 ml bottle; store on ice
  - River/pond/surface water: collect via sterile 500 ml bottle from ~30 cm depth; store on ice
  - Water supply (tubewell): pump for 5 minutes, heat pump mouth, draw several gallons to waste
  - Tubewell water: collect 500 ml aseptically; store on ice
  - Tap water: flush 1 minute, sterilize tap exterior, collect 500 ml, store on ice
  - Human stool: provide container; field staff collect within 2 hours; store on ice
  - Poultry pen litter: collect from three areas; pool ~20 g, store on ice
  - Animal manure: collect ~20 g with sterile spoon; store on ice
  - Poultry caecal samples: obtain from randomly selected poultry at slaughter; process caecal content in the lab
- Documentation and location data
  - GPS coordinates recorded for downstream river sample locations
  - Record pH, temperature, and conductivity for downstream river samples

## Data and quality considerations
- Standardised, dual-round sampling across urban, peri-urban, and rural settings enables comparisons of AMR-related factors across exposure levels.
- Consistent cold-chain handling and time-framed processing support reliable downstream laboratory analysis.
- The design includes explicit exposure contrasts (high vs. low) to assess transmission pathways and AMR dissemination in different environments.
