# Procedure for enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- Describe the workflow to enumerate, isolate, preserve, and identify E. coli isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporins or carbapenems from study samples.

## Scope and sample types
- Fecal samples (human and poultry), solid waste, soil
- Water samples: supply water (tap/tubewell) and waste water

## Key materials and media
- PBS (for dilutions), 10× PBS for making 1× PBS
- Antibiotics: cefotaxime, meropenem
- Chromogenic media: CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar KPC
- TBX medium, MacConkey agar
- Glycerol for cryopreservation (30%)
- Tryptone Soya broth, LifeGuard Soil Preservation solution
- API 20E kit for confirmation
- Consumables: Petri dishes, cryovials, inoculation loop, sterile tubes, etc.

## Media preparation (high-level)
- Prepare 1 L 10× PBS; autoclave; dilute to 1× PBS as needed
- Prepare 1 L CHROMagar ESBL and CHROMagar KPC media with appropriate supplements
- Prepare 1 L TBX medium for E. coli screening
- Prepare MacConkey agar with cefotaxime (1 mg/L) and MacConkey agar with meropenem (0.5 mg/L)
- Prepare antibiotic stock solutions for cefotaxime and meropenem and incorporate into MacConkey plates as required
- Plates prepared and stored protected from light; usable for limited timeframes

## Sample processing workflow
- For solid samples (fecal, soil, solid waste):
  - Weigh 1–5 g; suspend in 9–45 mL sterile PBS; vortex; settle
  - Collect 1 mL of suspension; prepare serial dilutions in PBS
  - Inoculate 0.1 mL of each dilution onto CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar KPC, and TBX plates; incubate at 37°C for 18–24 h
  - Count typical E. coli colonies (dark pink/reddish on ESBL and KPC plates)
  - Subculture at least 3 isolated colonies from ESBL onto MacConkey with cefotaxime; similarly from KPC onto MacConkey with meropenem
  - Create a culture sweep from MacConkey plates; suspend in TSB with 30% glycerol; store at -80°C

- For supply water:
  - Filter 2×100 mL through 0.22 µm membranes; place filters on mTEC plates (one with cefotaxime, one with meropenem)
  - Incubate 37°C for 2 h, then 44°C for 18 h
  - If colonies >200 CFU, dilute and repeat the process
  - Count reddish/purple colonies (E. coli); pick at least 3 colonies from each plate; subculture onto MacConkey with the same antibiotic
  - Prepare glycerol culture sweep and store at -80°C

- For wastewater:
  - Use 20 mL sample with 9-fold NS dilutions
  - Follow same filtration and plating approach as for supply water
  - Preserve isolates as above

## Confirmation and identification
- API 20E confirmation for one E. coli isolate per sample
  - If API20E is negative, test a second isolate from the same sample

- API 20E procedure (highlights)
  - Oxidase test on a colony; prepare bacterial suspension; inoculate API strip
  - Run tests (TDA, VP, GEL, CIT, etc.) per kit requirements
  - Incubate at 36 ± 2°C for 18–24 h; read results and interpret against the Reading Table
  - If fewer than 3 positive tests, incubate an additional 24 h and re-evaluate
  - If identification is unclear, follow up with additional tests (Nitrate Reduction, MacConkey growth) or use APIweb for final determination
  - If unidentifiable, run supplementary tests as specified and re-evaluate

- Reagents and handling notes
  - Follow manufacturer's instructions for reagent handling and preparation
  - Use first-use reagents; do not reuse prepared reagents when instructed

## Data, records and traceability
- Label all plates with agar type, date, and sample ID
- Record colony IDs, subculture outcomes, antibiotic conditions, and sample metadata
- Preserve isolates with corresponding metadata for downstream genetic analyses

## Outputs
- Counts of E. coli colonies on antibiotic-containing media per sample
- Isolated E. coli colonies subcultured onto MacConkey with corresponding antibiotics
- Glycerol-preserved E. coli stocks at -80°C for future analysis
- Confirmed E. coli identifications via API 20E (and any subsequent tests if needed)
