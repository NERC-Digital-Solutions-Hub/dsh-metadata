# Sampling plan and procedure for sample collection NERC study NE/N019555/1

## Overview
- Describes the sampling strategy and procedures for collecting human faecal, poultry caecal, and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) for the Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh study.
- Conducted in two rounds (Round 1 in winter, Round 2 in summer) across three settings: urban live poultry markets, commercial poultry farms, and rural households with domestic poultry.
- Aims to generate geolocated data for mapping and GIS-based analysis, with careful data collection timing, handling, and transport to laboratory.

## Study sites and sampling rounds
- Urban poultry markets
  - Round 1: 20 randomly selected markets in Dhaka; samples from human participants, municipal water, market waste streams, poultry cloacal samples, and poultry pens.
  - Round 2: 20 additional markets not in Round 1; total 40 markets.
- Commercial poultry farms
  - Round 1: 20 small-to-medium broiler farms; human participants; farm drinking water, poultry caecal and pen feces; downstream wastewater, pond/canal water, and river water.
  - Round 2: 20 additional farms; total 40 farms.
- Rural villages
  - Round 1: 20 households from 10 villages (2 per village): high exposure (poultry-owning) and low exposure (non-owning) groups; samples from adult women, tubewell water, soil, poultry caecal (if poultry owner), animal manure; downstream bodies of water.
  - Round 2: 20 additional households from 10 villages; total 40 households.
- Summary data collection plan
  - Each setting includes 40 sampled units per round (total 40 markets, 40 farms, 40 rural households across rounds).
  - High exposure vs. low exposure design across rural and farm contexts.
  - For markets and facilities, some samples (water, wastewater, solid waste) are shared across multiple facilities per market to reflect real-world sharing.

## Sample types and exposure context
- Human faecal samples (urban markets, farms, rural households)
- Poultry cloacal samples
- Poultry pen litter
- Water samples
  - Water supply (tubewell, drinking water)
  - Wastewater (market/farm/household drains)
  - Pond/river/surface water
  - Tap water
- Environmental and supporting samples
  - Soil from household compound
  - Animal manure (poultry-owning households, farms)
  - Solid waste from market dustbins
  - Downstream river water
- Exposure classifications
  - High exposure: locations with poultry presence or high contact (poultry-owning households, live poultry market stalls, commercial poultry farms)
  - Low exposure: locations without poultry exposure (non-poultry households, fruit/vegetable market stalls)

## Sampling data and geospatial elements
- GPS coordinates recorded for downstream river sample locations.
- Additional measurements at river locations: pH, temperature, conductivity.
- Sampling locations include a mix of urban markets, rural villages, and commercial farms to enable geospatial analyses of AMR transmission pathways.

## Sample collection procedures by type
- General
  - Wear new gloves for each sampling event.
  - Use sterile collection containers and spiked protocols for pooling where indicated.
  - Pool samples when required (e.g., wastewater from multiple locations, solid waste admixtures), ensuring no sharp objects are included.
  - Transport all samples on ice and process in the laboratory within specified timeframes (generally 12–24 hours depending on sample type).
- Human stool samples
  - Provide containers; field staff collect within 2 hours of collection; store on ice.
- Poultry cloacal samples
  - Collected from live poultry; paired with corresponding poultry pen samples when applicable.
- Poultry pen litter
  - Collected from three distinct areas; pool ~20 g, mix thoroughly, ensure absence of sharp objects; store on ice.
- Poultry caecal samples
  - Obtained from chickens selected at slaughter; caecal content processed in the lab; whole carcasses transported in sterile bags.
- Water samples
  - Water supply (tubewell): pump out ~5 minutes, temporarily heat pump nozzle, collect 500 ml aseptically; transport on ice.
  - Tap water: run water to waste for 1 minute, sanitize outside, collect 500 ml aseptically; transport on ice.
  - Wastewater: collect ~150 ml from three locations; pool into 500 ml sterile bottle; transport on ice.
  - Pond/river/surface water: collect by submerging sterile bottle ~30 cm below surface; fill, cap tightly; transport on ice.
- Soil samples
  - Collect ~20 g from near high-traffic areas (e.g., kitchen or main door); use autoclaved tools; store on ice; preserve a portion in LifeGuard solution.
- Solid waste samples
  - Collect from three locations around market dustbins; pool ~20 g; mix thoroughly; store on ice.
- Animal manure samples
  - Collect ~20 g fresh manure with sterile tools; store on ice.
- Poultry caecal samples
  - From slaughtered chickens; extract caecal content; process in the lab.

## Labelling, handling, and transport logistics
- All samples are placed immediately in cool boxes and transported to the laboratory for analysis.
- Clear labeling and sterile techniques emphasized throughout sample handling.
- Time-sensitive processing windows (e.g., human stool within 2 hours of collection; lab processing within 12–24 hours depending on sample type).

## GIS and data quality considerations
- The sampling design is explicitly geospatial, enabling mapping of AMR dynamics across urban markets, rural households, and farms.
- Collection of precise location data (GPS) and environmental context (water type, exposure level) supports spatial analyses and data interoperability.
- The plan accounts for data variability across locations and seasons (two rounds, winter vs. summer) to enhance temporal GIS analyses.
