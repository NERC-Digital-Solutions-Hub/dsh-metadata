# Sampling plan and procedure for sample collection NERC study NE/N019555/1

- Purpose
  - Describe the sampling strategy and procedures for collecting human faecal, poultry caecal, and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) in the AMR transmission study in urban and rural Bangladesh.

- Study settings
  - Urban live poultry markets
  - Commercial poultry farms
  - Rural households with domestic poultry

- Rounds
  - Round 1: winter
  - Round 2: summer
  - Each setting includes two rounds with sampling expanded to additional units in Round 2

- Sampling plan by setting

  - Urban poultry markets
    - Round 1: 20 markets randomly selected in Dhaka; one live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder per market
    - Round 2: 20 additional markets not in Round 1
    - Samples collected per market/site: human participants (faecal), municipal drinking water, solid waste disposal sites, wastewater downstream of markets, poultry cloacal samples, poultry pens floors/surfaces

  - Commercial poultry farms
    - Round 1: 20 small-to-medium broiler farms; at least one farm worker per farm plus a high-exposure and a low-exposure adult from same village
    - Round 2: 20 additional farms
    - Samples collected per farm: human faecal samples, drinking water supply, poultry caecal samples, mixed pen faeces, downstream wastewater, downstream pond/canal water, downstream river water

  - Rural villages
    - Round 1: 20 households from 10 villages (2 per village): high exposure (owning poultry) and low exposure (not owning poultry) per village
    - Round 2: 20 additional households from 10 villages
    - Samples collected per household: human faecal samples (adult women), tubewell drinking water, soil from around the compound, poultry caecal samples (if poultry-owning), animal manure, downstream freshwater ponds, wastewater, downstream river water

- Summary of samples collected (per setting; across rounds)
  - Human faecal samples: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (N=40 each); high exposure and low exposure categories noted where applicable
  - Poultry cloacal samples: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (N=40 each)
  - Poultry pen litter: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (N=40 each)
  - Poultry drinking water (from water feeders): Farms, Urban markets (data for Rural households not always applicable)
  - Animal manure: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (N=40 each)
  - Soil from compound: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (N=40 each)
  - Water supply (tubewell): Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (where applicable)
  - Waste water: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (where applicable)
  - Pond water: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (where applicable)
  - Downstream river water: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (where applicable)
  - Solid waste: Urban markets, Farms, Rural households (where applicable)
  - Note: Some categories show no sample in certain settings (marked as not applicable)

- Sample collection procedures (key points by sample type)

  - Soil samples
    - Select area near high foot traffic (e.g., near kitchen or doorway)
    - Wear new gloves; dig up to ~0.5 inch depth
    - Collect ~20 g soil in sterile bag; keep on ice
    - Subsample with sterile tool into LifeGuard solution; keep on ice

  - Solid waste samples
    - Collect from three locations around waste dumping areas near markets
    - Wear new gloves; collect ~20 g soil-like material
    - Pool and mix thoroughly; avoid sharp objects
    - Place in sterile bag; keep cool and transport to lab

  - Waste water samples
    - From three locations along farm/house/market runoff (about 150 ml per point)
    - Pool into a 500 ml sterile bottle; keep cool and transport
    - Collect with clean sterile container

  - River/pond/surface water samples
    - Use sterile 500 ml bottle; plunge ~30 cm below surface to fill
    - Tighten cap; keep cool; transport to lab

  - Supply water / tubewell water samples
    - Operate hand pump for 5 minutes; heat meter to prepare sample inlet
    - Collect 500 ml aseptically into sterile bottle
    - Cap and keep cool; transport to lab

  - Collection from taps
    - Clean nozzle with 70% alcohol; run water to waste for 1 minute
    - Flame sterilize outside of tap; cool briefly; collect 500 ml
    - Cap and transport on ice

  - Human stool samples
    - Provide participant with stool container
    - Field staff to collect within 2 hours of collection
    - Store on ice

  - Poultry pen litter
    - Wear gloves; collect from three areas of the floor or use a sterile spoon
    - Pool ~20 g; mix thoroughly; avoid sharp objects
    - Store in a cool box and transport to lab

  - Animal manure
    - Wear new gloves for each sample
    - Collect ~20 g fresh manure with sterile spoon
    - Store in a cool box; transport to lab

  - Poultry caecal samples
    - Chickens selected randomly from poultry, of mixed ages and sexes
    - Slaughtered on site; whole carcasses transported in sterile bag
    - Caecal sample extracted and processed in the lab

- Handling, transport, and data collection
  - All samples transported on ice
  - Laboratory processing within 12–24 hours of collection (times vary by sample type)
  - GPS coordinates recorded for downstream river sample locations
  - In-field measurements: pH, temperature, and conductivity for certain water samples

- Documentation and metadata
  - Sampling plan references NERC study NE/N019555/1
  - Explicit notes on high exposure versus low exposure groups (where applicable)
  - Clear labelling and sterile handling requirements to ensure data quality and comparability across settings and rounds
