# Antibiotic resistance and resistant genes in bacteria ( Escherichia coli ) from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Aim
- Evaluate presence and quantity of antibiotic-resistant E. coli and associated resistance genes in Bangladesh.
- Focus on resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.
- Collect and analyze samples across humans, poultry, and environmental sources to establish baseline prevalence.

## Study Design, Settings and Populations
- Three data collection settings:
  - Rural households
  - Small-scale commercial poultry farms (broiler chickens) in Mirzapur, Tangail district
  - Urban food markets in Dhaka city
- Sample types:
  - Humans: healthy adults (faecal samples)
  - Poultry: poultry caecal samples
  - Environment: water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/faeces
  - Cattle manure samples when available
- Ethical considerations:
  - Informed consent obtained; right to withdraw preserved
  - Ethical approvals: icddr,b PR16071 and Loughborough University R17-P037
- Rationale:
  - Baseline survey with no effect size or sample size calculation

## Data Collection and Timeline
- Data collection rounds:
  - Round 1: February–April 2017 (winter)
  - Round 2: August–October 2017 (summer)
  - Water samples from farms/urban markets: October 2018
- Data collectors:
  - Trained researchers from icddr,b
  - Samples transported to icddr,b laboratory for analysis

## Laboratory Analysis
- Detection of resistance:
  - Culture microbiology to identify E. coli positive/negative for resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems
- Quantification:
  - DNA extraction from antibiotic-resistant E. coli
  - Quantification of two resistance genes: blaCTX-M-1 and blaNDM-1 using qPCR
- Standards:
  - Standard operating procedures documented in supporting materials
  - Analyses conducted by experienced lab personnel at icddr,b

## Data Management and Quality Control
- Data capture:
  - Manual paper data sheets and automated outputs from laboratory equipment
  - All data entered into Excel by a data manager
- Quality checks:
  - Random checks comparing paper records with original data
  - Frequency checks to identify and correct out-of-range or erroneous values

## Data Structure and Documentation
- Primary dataset:
  - Ecolicounts.csv; blank cells indicate no data recorded
- Supporting documentation files (examples):
  - Samplingstrategy.rtf
  - GISpHtempconductivity.rtf
  - Microbiology.rtf
  - Dnaextraction.rtf
  - QuantitativePCR.rtf
  - Variablelistcounts.csv
- Purpose:
  - Comprehensive metadata and methodological context to support data discovery, understanding, and reuse

## Implications for Data Leaders
- End-to-end data lifecycle coverage from collection through analysis to documentation.
- Clear data provenance with lab SOPs and ethical clearances enabling trustworthy reuse.
- Emphasis on data quality control and meticulous metadata to facilitate discoverability and collaboration across networks.
