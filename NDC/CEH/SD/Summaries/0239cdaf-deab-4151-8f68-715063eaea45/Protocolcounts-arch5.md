# Antibiotic resistance and resistant genes in bacteria ( Escherichia coli ) from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

- Aim and scope
  - Assess presence and quantity of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli and associated resistance genes in Bangladesh.
  - Focus on resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.
  - Samples from humans (fecal), poultry (caecal), and the environment; including water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/feces; cattle samples where available.
  - Baseline survey across three settings: rural households, small-scale rural poultry farms (broiler chickens) in Mirzapur, Tangail district, and urban food markets in Dhaka.

- Study design details
  - No predefined size effect or sample size calculation; cross-sectional baseline assessment.
  - Data collection conducted in two rounds in 2017 (winter Feb-Apr; summer Aug-Oct); water samples in farms/markets collected Oct 2018.
  - Written informed consent obtained; participants may withdraw at any time.

- Ethical approvals
  - International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

- Sampling and collection methods
  - Trained researchers collected samples and transported them to icddr,b laboratory for analysis.

- Laboratory analysis and data generation
  - E. coli identified as resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems via culture microbiology; counts recorded.
  - DNA extracted from resistant E. coli; qPCR used to quantify resistance genes blaCTX-M-1 and blaNDM-1.
  - Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for lab work provided in supporting documentation.
  - Analyses conducted by experienced staff at icddr,b’s Food and Enteric Microbiology Laboratory.

- Data management and quality control
  - Initial data capture: manually on paper or automated lab output converted to Excel.
  - Data management: a data manager at icddr,b enters paper records into Excel; random checks against original sheets by an independent researcher.
  - Data quality checks: frequency checks to identify out-of-range or erroneous values; corrections implemented as needed.

- Data structure and documentation
  - Primary dataset: a single file named Ecolicounts.csv (blank cells indicate missing data).
  - Supporting documentation provided to accompany the dataset:
    - Samplingstrategy.rtf
    - GISpHtempconductivity.rtf
    - Microbiology.rtf
    - Dnaextraction.rtf
    - QuantitativePCR.rtf
    - Variablelistcounts.csv

- Data governance implications for reuse
  - Comprehensive methodological and laboratory SOPs enable reproducibility and interpretation.
  - Provenance includes ethical approvals, consent, sampling settings, rounds, and transport to the lab.
  - Clear metadata and accompanying documentation support data discoverability and reuse, while noting potential data limitations (e.g., missing values in the primary file).
