# Antibiotic resistance and resistant genes in bacteria ( Escherichia coli ) from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Aim
- Assess presence and quantity of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli and associated resistance genes in Bangladesh.
- Focus on resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.
- Sample from humans (faecal), poultry (caecal), and the environment (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/faeces).
- Baseline survey to determine prevalence; no expected size effect or sample size calculation.

## Study settings and participants
- Data collection in three settings: rural households, small-scale commercial poultry farms (broiler chickens) in Mirzapur, Tangail district, and urban food markets in Dhaka city.
- Sample types: humans (faecal), poultry (caecal), environment (water, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/pen faeces); cattle faecal/manure where available.
- Data collection rounds: winter 2017 (Feb–Apr) and summer 2017 (Aug–Oct); water samples from farms/urban markets in Oct 2018.
- Conducted by trained researchers from icddr,b; samples transported to icddr,b laboratory.

## Ethical considerations
- Written informed consent obtained; right to withdraw at any stage.
- Ethical clearance: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

## Data collection and laboratory methods
- Collection methods: standardized procedures by icddr,b; samples transported to laboratory for analysis.
- Analysis methods:
  - Culture microbiology to identify E. coli and determine resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.
  - DNA extraction from antibiotic-resistant E. coli; quantification of two resistance genes (blaCTX-M-1 and blaNDM-1) using quantitative PCR (qPCR).
  - Standard operating procedures provided in supporting documentation.
  - Laboratory work conducted by experienced icddr,b researchers.

## Quality control and data management
- Data capture: manual paper records or automated lab outputs; data manager enters into Excel.
- Quality checks: random checks against original collection sheets; frequency checks to identify out-of-range or erroneous values with corrections as needed.

## Data structure and accessibility
- Dataset consists of a single file: Ecolicounts.csv; blank cells indicate no data recorded.
- Detailed data collection methods and data structure described in supporting documentation.
