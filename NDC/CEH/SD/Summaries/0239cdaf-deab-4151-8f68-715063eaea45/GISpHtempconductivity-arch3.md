# Standard operating procedure for pH meters and EC/TDS/Temperature Testers NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Overview
- Describes operation procedures for the pH meter HI 98127 and the EC/TDS/Temperature Tester HI 98311 used in the NERC Study.
- Measurements supported:
  - pH: -2.0 to 16.0 with ±0.1 accuracy; temperature range -5.0 to 60.0°C.
  - EC: 0–3999 µS/cm with ±2% full scale.
  - TDS: 0–2000 mg/L with ±2% full scale.
  - Temperature: 0.0–60.0°C with ±0.5°C (or ±1°F).
- Purpose is to enable consistent data collection for environmental water samples, including metadata and data quality considerations.

## Geographical coordinates and sampling metadata
- GPS coordinates of downstream river water samples recorded using a Garmin GPS (Model etrex 10).
- Readings captured as GIS northing/easting (degrees and minutes) and digital latitude/longitude for sample collection points.

## pH measurement procedure (HI 98127)

### A. Turning on and battery status
- Press and hold MODE until the LCD lights up.
- Battery life is shown as a percentage (e.g., % 100 BATT).

### B. Taking measurements
- Submerge the electrode and stir gently.
- Take readings when the stability symbol disappears.
- The pH value is automatically temperature-compensated on the primary LCD; the sample temperature is shown on the secondary LCD.

### C. Freezing the display
- While measuring, press SET/HOLD to freeze; HOLD appears on the secondary display with the reading.
- Press any button to return to normal mode.

### Safety and maintenance (pH meter)
- Glass bulb is sensitive to electrostatic discharge; avoid touching the bulb.
- After use, rinse electrode with water and store with storage solution in the protective cap; do not use distilled or deionized water for storage.
- If the electrode has dried out, soak in storage solution for at least one hour to reactivate.

## EC/TDS/Temperature measurement procedure (HI 98311)

### A. Turning on and battery status
- Press and hold MODE for 2–3 seconds.
- Battery status is shown similarly to the pH meter.

### B. Taking measurements
- Submerge the probe in the solution.
- Use plastic beakers to minimize electromagnetic interference.
- Select EC or TDS mode with SET/HOLD.
- Take readings when the stability symbol disappears.
- The EC/TDS value is automatically temperature compensated; the secondary display shows sample temperature.

### C. Freezing the display
- Press and hold SET/HOLD for 2–3 seconds until HOLD appears on the secondary display.
- Press any button to return to normal measuring mode.
