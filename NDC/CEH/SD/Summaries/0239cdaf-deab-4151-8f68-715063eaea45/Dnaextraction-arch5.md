# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates

## Overview
- Describes procedures to extract DNA from environmental samples (soil, water, stool, etc.) and bacterial isolates using Qiagen kits.
- Includes kit-specific protocols, general precautions, storage recommendations, and preparation of template DNA.

## Scope and Applications
- Applicable to:
  - Soil samples using DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit
  - Water samples using DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit
  - Stool samples using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit
  - Bacterial isolates and preparation of template DNA
- Aimed at producing DNA suitable for downstream molecular analyses with standardized steps to support reproducibility and data integrity.

## Procedures by Kit/Method
- DNA extraction from soil (PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit, Qiagen 12888-50)
  - Use 0.25 g soil in PowerBead Tubes; prepare Solution C1; perform bead beating and centrifugation steps as specified.
  - Sequentially process with Solutions C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6; bind to spin filter; wash; elute with 100 μl of Solution C6 or DNA-Free water.
  - Store extracted DNA frozen at -20°C to -80°C.
- DNA extraction from environmental water (PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit)
  - Prepare warm Solutions PW1–PW6; filter water samples; process beads and solutions through specified centrifugation steps.
  - Elute DNA with PW6; store at -20°C to -80°C.
  - Special precautions include warming PW1 and PW3 to dissolve precipitates; shake PW4 before use.
- DNA extraction from stool (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit)
  - Weigh stool, homogenize in Buffer ASL, heat, pellet debris, remove inhibitors with InhibitEX.
  - Digest with proteinase K and Buffer AL; add ethanol; apply lysate to QIAamp spin column; wash with AW1 and AW2.
  - Elute with Buffer AE; store at -20°C to -80°C.
- Preparation of Template DNA
  - Prepare from a culture: suspend in autoclaved water, boil, cool on ice, centrifuge, collect supernatant, store at -20°C (noted as -200 C in text).

## Safety, Handling, and Precautions
- General precautions for all kits:
  - Avoid skin contact with reagents; wear gloves; consult MSDS for emergencies.
  - Do not ingest; keep flammable reagents away from flames.
- Kit-specific notes:
  - Warm certain reagents (e.g., PW1, PW3) to dissolve precipitates as needed.
  - Follow precise volumes, times, and centrifugation speeds to prevent sample loss or damage.

## Data and Metadata Considerations for Data Stewards
- Critical provenance data to capture for datasets derived from these procedures:
  - Kit name and catalog numbers (e.g., DNeasy PowerSoil, DNeasy PowerWater, QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit)
  - Lot/batch numbers, operator, date of extraction
  - Sample type and source (soil, water, stool), sample mass/volume
  - Detailed protocol version and any deviations from the standard procedure
  - Volumes used (solutions C1–C6, PW1–PW6, AW1/AW2, AE, etc.), spin speeds, times, and temperatures
  - Equipment used (centrifuges, vortex mixer, spin columns) and settings
  - DNA concentration or quality metrics if obtained; storage location and conditions
  - Storage duration and conditions (-20°C to -80°C) for extracted DNA
- Rationale:
  - Ensures reproducibility, traceability, and interoperability across studies
  - Facilitates quality assurance and data governance, including documenting method updates and kit replacements

## Quality Assurance and Reproducibility
- Standardized, kit-based workflows with defined steps, temperatures, times, and spin speeds to minimize variability.
- Inhibitor removal steps (e.g., InhibitEX for stool) and careful handling to maximize DNA purity.
- Explicit storage guidance to preserve DNA integrity for downstream analyses.
- Documentation of protocol versioning and any deviations to support reproducibility.

## Documentation and Provenance
- References to kit manuals and the study NE/N019555/1 for context and traceability.
- Explicit procedural steps, equipment lists, and reagent handling instructions included to enable auditability.

## Storage and Downstream Use
- Extracted DNA is stored frozen at -20°C to -80°C.
- Prepared template DNA is intended for downstream applications; handling instructions ensure integrity.
