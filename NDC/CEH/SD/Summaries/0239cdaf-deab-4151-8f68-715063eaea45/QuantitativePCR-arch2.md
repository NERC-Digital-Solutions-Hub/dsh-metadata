# Procedure for Real-time PCR assay

- Objective
  - To assess the presence of bla CTX-M-1 and bla NDM-1 in environmental and human fecal samples using quantitative PCR (qPCR).

- Equipment
  - CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad)
  - PCR hood with UV light
  - Vortex mixer
  - Rotor
  - Refrigerator (2–8°C)
  - Refrigerator (-20°C)

- Reagents
  - Amplification and detection of blaCTX-M-1 (159 bp) and blaNDM-1 (152 bp) amplicons via TaqMan technology
  - In-house designed primers:
    - blaCTX-M-1 F: 5-ACGTGGCGATGAATAAGCTG-3
    - blaCTX-M-1 R: 5-CCCGAGGTGAAGTGGTATCA-3
    - blaNDM-1 F: 5-C AAC CAC AGC CTG ACT TTC GC-3
    - blaNDM-1 R: 5-CAG CCA CCA AAA GCG ATG TC-3
  - In-house designed probes (FAM-labeled with BHQ):
    - blaCTX-M-1 Probe: 5-FAM-ACGTTAAACACCGCCATTCC-3BHQ
    - blaNDM-1 Probe: 5-FAM-TGGCCCGCTCAAGGTATTTT-3BHQ
  - Amplicons are detected with FAM fluorescence; probes are BHQ quenchers
  - Primer and probe concentrations (optimization):
    - Tested primers: 200, 300, 500, 900 nM
    - Tested probes: 100, 200, 300 nM
    - Final optimization: primers 500 nM, probe 200 nM
  - Master mix and samples:
    - Master mix (20.0 µL total): 10.0 µL of SsoAdvanced Universal (2x) mix, 0.2 µL of each primer (500 nM), 0.2 µL of probe (200 nM), 7.4 µL nuclease-free water, 2.0 µL of respective DNA samples

- Methods
  - qPCR conditions:
    - Initial denaturation: 3.0 min at 95°C
    - 35 cycles: 15 sec at 95°C and 25 sec at 57°C

- Interpretation of qPCR results using standard curve
  - Positive control: a plasmid containing the conserved sequence of both blaCTX-M-1 and blaNDM-1
  - Standard curve: prepare serial dilutions of plasmid DNA to plot Ct (Y-axis) versus log DNA quantity (X-axis)
  - Quantification: determine the quantity of blaCTX-M-1 and blaNDM-1 from the standard curve, following the approach described in Naas et al., 2011
