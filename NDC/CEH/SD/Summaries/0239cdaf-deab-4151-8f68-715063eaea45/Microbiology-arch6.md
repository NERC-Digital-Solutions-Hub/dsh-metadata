# Procedure for enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates NERC project NE/N019555/1

- Purpose
  - Describe the procedure to enumerate, isolate, preserve, and identify E. coli isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporins or carbapenems from study samples.

- Overview of workflow
  - Process multiple sample types (fecal/human and poultry, solid waste, soil, supply water, wastewater).
  - Prepare selective/differential media (CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar KPC, TBX, MacConkey with cefotaxime or meropenem).
  - Enrich and plate samples on targeted media; incubate and identify presumptive E. coli by colony appearance.
  - Subculture selected colonies to confirm resistance phenotype on MacConkey with the corresponding antibiotic.
  - Create glycerol-preserved culture sweeps at -80°C for future use.
  - Confirm identity of E. coli with API 20E; if initial isolate is negative, test a second isolate from the same sample.

- Key media and media preparation (highlights)
  - CHROMagar ESBL and CHROMagar KPC: prepare 1 L batches, include appropriate supplements, pour into plates, store protected from light.
  - TBX medium: prepare plates for presumptive E. coli screening; incubate and store.
  - MacConkey agar with cefotaxime (1 mg/L) and with meropenem (0.5 mg/L): prepare stock antibiotic solutions, inoculate plates, and incubate.
  - For water and wastewater: use two filters onto mTEC media plates (one with cefotaxime, one with meropenem) and incubate with a two-stage temperature plan.
  - Supplementation notes: create fresh supplement solutions for ESBL and KPC media; use on the same day.

- Sample processing and isolation (data points collected)
  - Fecal/soil/wastewater samples: suspend 1–5 g in PBS, vortex, settle, serially dilute, inoculate onto ESBL, KPC, and TBX plates; incubate 37°C for 18–24 h; identify typical E. coli colonies (dark pink/reddish on ESBL and KPC plates).
  - Subculture: pick at least 3 colonies from ESBL and 3 from KPC plates onto MacConkey with cefotaxime or meropenem respectively.
  - Culture preservation: create a culture sweep from MacConkey plates and suspend in tryptone soya broth with 30% glycerol for -80°C storage.
  - Water and wastewater samples: filter 2x100 mL; place filters on mTEC plates with cefotaxime and meropenem; incubate with a two-stage temperature plan; count reddish-purple/magenta colonies; pick colonies for MacConkey with corresponding antibiotic and store as above.

- Confirmation and identification (data points)
  - API 20E confirmation: test one E. coli isolate from each sample; if API 20E is negative, test a second isolate from the same sample.
  - API 20E workflow: oxidase test, prepare bacterial suspension, inoculate API strip wells, incubate 36 ± 2°C for 18–24 h, interpret results, and use APIweb for organism identification.
  - If identification is unclear, perform supplementary tests (Nitrate reduction and MacConkey growth) as needed to resolve results.

- Data outputs and records (data products)
  - Sample-level identifiers: sample ID, matrix (fecal/human, poultry, soil, water, wastewater), collection date.
  - Plate-level data: media type (ESBL, KPC, TBX, MacConkey with cefotaxime, MacConkey with meropenem), plate ID, incubation conditions, colony counts.
  - Isolate-level data: unique colony/isolate IDs, source plate, colony morphology, subculture results, preservation lot, glycerol stock vial IDs, -80°C storage status.
  - Confirmation data: API 20E result for each tested isolate, accompanying interpretation, and any follow-up tests performed when needed.
  - Data usage-ready outputs: consolidated records linking sample IDs to confirmed E. coli isolates and resistance phenotype, suitable for downstream analysis and dashboards.

- Data management and storage
  - Maintain organized log of media preparations, plate labeling, and incubation results.
  - Record isolate IDs and storage locations (glycerol stock in -80°C; culture sweeps linked to sample IDs).
  - Maintain a traceable chain from initial sample to final confirmed E. coli identification.

- Quality control and decision points
  - Require at least 3 isolated colonies from ESBL and 3 from KPC plates for subculture confirmation.
  - If API 20E does not confirm E. coli, test a second isolate from the same sample to obtain confirmation.
  - Ensure fresh preparation of media supplements; do not reuse supplement solutions.
  - Adhere to specified incubation times and temperatures for all steps to ensure reproducibility.

- How this supports data use
  - Enables cross-sample comparisons of ESBL- and KPC-producing E. coli prevalence across matrices (fecal, water, wastewater, soil).
  - Provides structured, trackable data suitable for dashboards, reporting, and downstream analyses.
  - Allows data-driven surveillance and policy-oriented insights by summarizing resistance phenotypes and isolate counts over time and across locations.
