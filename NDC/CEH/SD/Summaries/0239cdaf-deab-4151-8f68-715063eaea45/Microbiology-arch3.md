# Procedure for enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- Describe a procedure to enumerate, isolate, preserve, and identify E. coli isolates that are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins or carbapenems from study samples.

## Scope and sample types
- Applies to fecal (human and poultry), solid waste, soil samples.
- Also covers supply water (tap/tubewell) and waste water.
- Uses selective media to identify presumptive E. coli colonies and resistance to cefotaxime and meropenem.

## Materials and media
- PBS solutions and a 10× PBS concentrate for making 1× PBS.
- Antibiotics and media:
  - Cefotaxime, meropenem
  - CHROMagar ESBL
  - CHROMagar KPC
  - MacConkey agar
  - TBX medium
  - MacConkey agar with cefotaxime
  - MacConkey agar with meropenem
- Glycerol-preservation medium (Tryptone soya broth with 30% glycerol) and LifeGuard Soil Preservation solution
- API 20E identification kit and reagents
- Reagents for oxidase testing
- Sterile consumables (petri dishes, tubes, cryovials, inoculation loops, filter papers, etc.)
- Equipment: incubator (36 ± 2 °C), autoclave, refrigerator (2–8 °C), freezer (-20 °C and -80 °C), water bath (40–100 °C), shaker, etc.

## Preparation steps (high-level)
- Prepare 1 L of 1× PBS from 10× PBS, autoclave.
- Prepare 1 L of CHROMagar ESBL and 1 L of CHROMagar KPC media with respective supplements; prepare supplements freshly the same day.
- Prepare 1 L of TBX medium and 1 L of MacConkey media (with/without antibiotics) with appropriate cefotaxime or meropenem stock additions.
- Prepare antibiotic stock solutions (cefota xime, meropenem) and add to MacConkey agar to achieve final concentrations (e.g., cefotaxime 1 mg/L; meropenem 0.5 mg/L).
- Plate preparation rules include handling supplements fresh, protection from light, and storage timelines (plates typically usable for short term at room temp or refrigerated up to certain durations).

## Sample processing and isolation workflow

### For fecal (human and poultry), solid waste, and soil
- Weigh 1–5 g of sample; suspend in 9–45 mL sterile PBS; vortex 1 min; settle 15 min at room temp.
- Collect 1 mL of suspension; prepare serial dilutions in PBS.
- Inoculate 0.1 mL of each dilution onto:
  - One CHROMagar ESBL plate
  - One CHROMagar KPC plate
  - One TBX plate
- Incubate at 37 °C for 18–24 h.
- Identify typical E. coli colonies (dark pink to reddish) on ESBL and KPC plates.
- From ESBL plate, pick at least 3 isolated colonies and subculture onto MacConkey agar with cefotaxime.
- From KPC plate, pick at least 3 isolated colonies and subculture onto MacConkey agar with meropenem.
- From MacConkey plates, perform a culture sweep and suspend in TSB with 30% glycerol; freeze at -80 °C for storage/use.

### For supply water (tap or tubewell)
- Pass 2×100 mL water through two 0.22 μm filters; place filters on mTEC agar plates (one with cefotaxime 1 mg/L, one with meropenem 0.5 mg/L).
- Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h, then 44 °C for 18 h.
- Refrain from testing leftover water; store at 4 °C until results.
- If colonies >200 CFU, perform appropriate dilutions the next day and repeat plating.
- Count reddish-purple/magenta colonies; pick at least 3 isolates per sample and subculture onto MacConkey agar with the same antibiotics.
- Freeze a culture sweep at -80 °C as above.

### For waste water
- Take 20 mL wastewater; prepare 9-fold dilution with sterile NS.
- Filter through two 0.22 μm membranes onto mTEC plates (cefotaxime 1 mg/L and meropenem 0.5 mg/L).
- Incubate 37 °C for 2 h, then 44 °C for 18 h.
- If colonies >200 CFU, dilute and repeat the incubation as above.
- Identify colonies as E. coli (reddish-purple/magenta), pick at least 3 isolates per sample, subculture onto MacConkey with the same antibiotics.
- Prepare glycerol stock at -80 °C.

## Confirmation and identification (API 20E)
- Test one E. coli isolate from each sample with API 20E for confirmation and for subsequent genetic analysis.
- If API 20E presumptive result is negative, test a second isolate from the same sample.
- API 20E procedure:
  - Oxidase test to confirm Enterobacteriaceae (oxidase negative typical).
  - Prepare bacterial suspension in saline; inoculate API strip wells (glucose tests, CIT, VP, GEL, etc.) according to kit instructions.
  - Use mineral oil to create anaerobic conditions for certain tests.
  - Incubate at 36 ± 2 °C for 18–24 h; interpret results using the Reading Table.
  - If fewer than 3 positive tests after initial incubation, repeat for 24 h.
  - If unidentifiable, perform additional tests (Nitrate reduction, growth on MacConkey, etc.) per protocol and consult API-20E identification resources.

## Data products and outputs
- Confirmed E. coli isolates with resistance phenotype (to cefotaxime and/or meropenem) from each sample.
- Glycerol-preserved stores of isolates (-80 °C) and culture sweeps for ongoing analyses.
- API 20E results and interpretation for species confirmation and potential downstream genetic analyses.
- Documentation linked to sample ID, colony ID, plate/medium type, incubation conditions, and test results.

## Quality, governance, and implementation notes (monitoring framework relevance)
- The protocol emphasizes standardized, repeatable methods across sample types to enable consistent monitoring of E. coli with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase resistance.
- Requires meticulous metadata and traceability (sample IDs, colony IDs, plate types, media lots, antibiotic concentrations, incubation conditions) to support data quality and comparability.
- Storage and data sharing considerations include preserving isolates (-80 °C), recording results, and ensuring data can be tied back to origin samples; potential barriers include metadata gaps and platform-specific reporting requirements.
- Approaches align with monitoring goals to assess environmental dissemination of resistant E. coli and to inform policy decisions on antimicrobial resistance surveillance and environmental health monitoring.
