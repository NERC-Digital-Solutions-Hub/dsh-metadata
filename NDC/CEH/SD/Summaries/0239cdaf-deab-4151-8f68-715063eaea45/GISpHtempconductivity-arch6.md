# Standard operating procedure for pH meters and EC/TDS/Temperature Testers NERC project NE/N019555/1

- GPS coordinates of downstream river water samples were recorded using a Garmin GPS (Model etrex 10). Readings were logged as GIS northing and easting (degrees and minutes) and as digital latitude and longitude of the sample collection point.

## pH Meter (Model: HI 98127)

- Purpose and ranges
  - Measures pH from -2.0 to 16.0 with accuracy ±0.1 pH.
  - Temperature range: -5.0 to 60.0°C (23.0 to 140°F).

- Turning on and battery status
  - Press and hold MODE until LCD lights.
  - Battery status shown on LCD for ~1 second, e.g., "% 100 BATT".

- Taking measurements
  - Submerge the electrode in the solution and stir gently.
  - Take readings when the stability symbol disappears.
  - Primary LCD shows pH value (automatically temperature-compensated); secondary LCD shows sample temperature.

- Freezing the display
  - In measurement mode, press SET/HOLD.
  - “HOLD” appears on the secondary display and the reading freezes (e.g., pH 5.78 HOLD).
  - Press any button to return to normal mode.

- Safety and maintenance
  - Glass bulb at the electrode tip is sensitive to electrostatic discharge; avoid touching.
  - Rinse electrode with water after use; store with storage solution in the protective cap (do not use distilled/deionized water for storage).
  - If the electrode dries, soak in storage solution for at least one hour to reactivate.

## EC/TDS/Temperature Tester (Model: HI 98311)

- Purpose and ranges
  - Conductivity (EC): 0–3999 µS/cm, accuracy ±2% full scale.
  - Total dissolved solids (TDS): 0–2000 mg/L, accuracy ±2% full scale.
  - Temperature: 0.0–60.0°C (32.0–140.0°F), accuracy ±0.5°C / ±1°F.

- Turning on and battery status
  - Press and hold MODE for 2–3 seconds.
  - Battery status shown on LCD for ~1 second.

- Taking measurements
  - Submerge the probe in the solution.
  - Use plastic beakers to minimize electromagnetic interference.
  - Select EC or TDS mode with SET/HOLD.
  - Readings are shown with EC/TDS on the primary LCD and temperature on the secondary LCD.
  - Take measurements when the stability symbol disappears.

- Freezing the display
  - Press SET/HOLD for 2–3 seconds until HOLD appears on the secondary display.
  - Press a button to return to normal mode.
