# Antibiotic resistance and resistant genes in bacteria ( Escherichia coli ) from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Objective
- Assess presence and quantity of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli and associated resistance genes in Bangladesh
- Target resistance: third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems
- Sample types: humans (faecal), poultry (caecal), environment (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/faeces); cattle manure where available

## Settings and sampling
- Data collection in three settings: rural households, small-scale commercial poultry farms (broiler chickens) in Mirzapur, Tangail district, and urban food markets in Dhaka
- Baseline survey design with no expected size effect and no sample size calculation

## Ethical considerations
- Written informed consent with right to withdraw
- Ethical clearance obtained from International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037)

## Data collection timing
- Round 1: February–April 2017 (winter)
- Round 2: August–October 2017 (summer)
- Water supply samples in farms/urban markets: October 2018
- Sample collection conducted by icddr,b researchers; transported to icddr,b laboratory

## Laboratory analysis
- E. coli isolated and tested for resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems via culture microbiology
- DNA extracted from resistant E. coli; quantified resistance genes blaCTX-M-1 and blaNDM-1 using qPCR
- Standard operating procedures provided in supporting documentation
- Analyses performed by the Food and Enteric Microbiology Laboratory, icddr,b

## Data management and quality control
- Data captured on paper or via automated lab outputs; manual entry into Excel by a data manager
- Random checks against original sheets; frequency checks to identify and correct out-of-range values

## Data structure and documentation
- Primary dataset: Ecolicounts.csv (blank cells indicate no data)
- Supporting documentation includes: Samplingstrategy.rtf, GISpHtempconductivity.rtf, Microbiology.rtf, Dnaextraction.rtf, QuantitativePCR.rtf, Variablelistcounts.csv

## Relevance to environmental health monitoring and governance (data management perspective)
- Demonstrates cross-sector indicators (human, animal, environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance)
- Emphasizes standardized laboratory methods, documented SOPs, and QA steps
- Comprehensive metadata and documentation through multiple support files to aid data provenance and reuse
- Includes ethical considerations and clear data handling practices that influence data sharing and governance
