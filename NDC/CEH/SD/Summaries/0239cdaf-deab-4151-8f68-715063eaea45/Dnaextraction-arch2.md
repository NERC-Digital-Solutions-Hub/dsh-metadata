# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

- Purpose
  - Describes procedures for DNA extraction from environmental samples (soil, water, stool) and bacterial isolates obtained from the study.

- Methods and kits used
  - Soil: DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen; Cat. No. 12888-50)
  - Water: DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen; Cat. No. 14900-5-NF)
  - Stool: QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen; Cat. No. 51504)
  - Bacterial isolates: DNA extraction with Heat-lysis method
  - General approach: kit-based extractions with standardized procedures; some steps include heat/lysis, binding, washing, and elution; DNA prepared for downstream applications

- General precautions and handling
  - Avoid skin contact with reagents; wear gloves; follow universal precautions
  - Refer to Material Safety Data Sheets for emergency procedures
  - Handle flammable reagents (e.g., ethanol) away from flames/sparks

- Storage of DNA and reagents
  - Extracted DNA: recommended to store frozen at -20°C to -80°C
  - Kit reagents: stored at room temperature (15–30°C) where specified

- Detailed procedures (summary of workflow)
  - Soil DNA extraction (PowerSoil kit)
    - Add soil to PowerBead Tubes; mix; check and dissolve precipitated Solution C1 if needed
    - Sequentially add Solutions C1–C4 with incubations and centrifugations
    - Bind DNA on spin filter with Solution C4/C5; perform washes
    - Elute DNA with Solution C6 (or water); collect DNA and store
  - Water DNA extraction (PowerWater kit)
    - Filter water samples; prepare the filter in PowerWater Bead Tube with Solution PW1
    - Vortex and centrifuge to release DNA; transfer supernatant
    - Add Solution IRS, incubate, and centrifuge
    - Bind, wash (PW3, PW4, PW5), and dry the spin filter
    - Elute DNA with Solution PW6; store
  - Stool DNA extraction (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit)
    - Weigh stool; homogenize with Buffer ASL; heat at 70°C; pellet particulates
    - Use InhibitEX to remove inhibitors; remove inhibitors by centrifugation
    - Add Proteinase K and Buffer AL; incubate; add ethanol
    - Apply lysate to QIAamp column; perform sequential washes with AW1 and AW2
    - Elute DNA with Buffer AE; store
  - Preparation of Template DNA
    - From a bacterial culture: suspend colony in autoclaved water, boil, cool on ice
    - Centrifuge to pellet debris; collect supernatant for template DNA
    - Store at low temperature for later use (document notes – typical practice is -20°C to -80°C)

- Notes and references
  - Document provides step-by-step, kit-specific instructions with volumes, times, and speeds
  - References include Qiagen protocols and kit documentation

- Scope and application
  - Protocols are designed to enable consistent, reproducible DNA extraction from diverse environmental and bacterial samples
  - Aimed at enabling downstream analyses and integration into standardized environmental monitoring datasets and analyses
