# Standard operating procedure for pH meters and EC/TDS/Temperature Testers NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Geographical coordinates
- GPS coordinates of downstream river water samples were recorded using a Garmin GPS (Model etrex 10), documented as GIS northing/easting in degrees and minutes and as digital latitude/longitude of the sample collection point.

## Devices and measurement purposes
- pH meter (Model HI 98127)
  - Measures pH from -2.0 to 16.0 with an accuracy of ±0.1 pH
  - Temperature range of -5.0 to 60.0°C / 23.0 to 140°F
  - Displays temperature on the secondary LCD; pH value is automatically temperature-compensated on the primary LCD
- EC/TDS/Temperature tester (Model HI 98311)
  - EC range: 0 to 3999 µS/cm with accuracy of ±2% F.S.
  - TDS range: 0 to 2000 mg/L (ppm) with accuracy of ±2% F.S.
  - Temperature range: 0.0 to 60.0°C / 32.0 to 140.0°F with accuracy of ±0.5°C / ±1°F

## Measurement procedures

### pH meter operation (HI 98127)
- A. Turn on and check battery status
  - Press and hold MODE until the LCD backlight activates
  - LCD shows segments briefly, then displays remaining battery life (e.g., % 100 BATT)
- B. Taking measurements
  - Submerge the electrode in the solution and stir gently
  - Take readings when the stability symbol disappears
  - Primary LCD shows the pH value (temperature-compensated); secondary LCD shows sample temperature
- C. Freeze the display
  - In measurement mode, press SET/HOLD
  - “HOLD” appears on the secondary display and the reading is frozen (e.g., pH 5.78 HOLD)
  - Press any button to return to normal mode

### EC/TDS/Temperature tester operation (HI 98311)
- A. Turn on and check battery status
  - Press and hold MODE for 2–3 seconds
  - LCD shows segments briefly, then displays remaining battery life
- B. Taking measurements
  - Submerge the probe in the solution
  - Use plastic beakers to minimize electromagnetic interference
  - Select EC or TDS mode with SET/HOLD
  - Take readings when the stability symbol disappears
  - EC (or TDS) value shown on the primary LCD; sample temperature shown on the secondary LCD (temperature-compensated)
- C. Freeze the display
  - Press SET/HOLD for 2–3 seconds until HOLD appears on the secondary display
  - Press any button to return to normal measuring mode

## Safety and maintenance
- The glass bulb at the end of the electrode is sensitive to electrostatic discharge; avoid touching the glass
- After use, rinse the electrode with water to minimize contamination
- Store with storage solution in the protective cap; do not use distilled or deionized water for storage
- If the electrode has been left dry, soak in storage solution for at least one hour to reactivate it
