# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

- Purpose: Describe procedures for extracting DNA from environmental samples (soil, water, etc.) or bacterial isolates, including specific kits and methods used.

- General precautions:
  - Avoid skin contact with reagents; wear gloves; use universal precautions.
  - Refer to Material Safety Data Sheets for emergencies; keep flammable reagents away from flames.
  - Reagents may require warming or handling at recommended temperatures.

- Kit and Extracted DNA storage:
  - Store extracted DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C) when not in use.
  - Store kit reagents at room temperature (15-30°C) as specified.

- DNA extraction from soil samples (DNeasy PowerSoil Kit):
  - Use PowerBead Tubes with ~0.25 g soil; ensure Solution C1 is dissolved (heat if precipitated).
  - Add C1, vortex, and lyse; ensure PowerBead Tubes rotate freely during centrifugation.
  - Sequentially process with Solutions C2, C3, and C4; then bind to Spin Filters with additional C4.
  - Wash with Solutions C5 and proceed to elution with Solution C6 (or DNA-Free Water).
  - eluted DNA stored frozen; ready for downstream applications.

- DNA extraction from water samples (DNeasy PowerWater Kit):
  - Filter water sample; prepare filter in PowerWater Bead Tube; add Solution PW1 (warm as needed).
  - Bead-beat and centrifuge to separate; transfer supernatant and perform subsequent steps with IRS, PW3, PW4, PW5, and PW6.
  - Bind DNA on MB Spin Column; perform washes; elute with Buffer AE or equivalent.
  - Store eluted DNA frozen.

- Preparation for PowerWater workflow:
  - Optional centrifugation steps to enhance recovery; ensure careful handling to avoid pellet carryover.

- DNA extraction from stool samples (QIAmp DNA Stool Mini Kit):
  - Weigh 180–220 mg stool; homogenize in Buffer ASL; heat at 70°C; homogenize thoroughly.
  - Centrifuge to pellet particulates; transfer supernatant to new tube.
  - Add InhibitEX tablet to bind inhibitors; incubate and centrifuge to remove inhibitors.
  - Add Proteinase K and Buffer AL; incubate at 70°C; add ethanol; apply lysate to QIAamp spin column.
  - Perform sequential washes with Buffer AW1 and AW2; elute DNA with Buffer AE.
  - Store extracted DNA frozen.

- Preparation of Template DNA:
  - From a TSA culture, suspend in autoclaved water; boil for 10 minutes, then place on ice.
  - Centrifuge to pellet debris; collect supernatant (≈200 µl) for immediate use or storage at -200°C (likely a typo for -20°C).

  - Reference: Qiagen Genomic DNA isolation technologies page for additional details.

- Outputs:
  - DNA suitable for downstream analyses, with storage guidance provided for each extraction method.
