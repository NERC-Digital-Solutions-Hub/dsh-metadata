# Antibiotic resistance and resistant genes in bacteria ( Escherichia coli ) from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Aim
- Assess presence and quantity of antibiotic resistant E. coli and associated resistance genes in Bangladesh
- Focus on resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenem antibiotics

## Sample sources and settings
- Humans: faecal samples
- Poultry: caecal samples from the gastrointestinal tract
- Environment: water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/faeces
- Cattle: faecal/manure samples in rural households where available
- Settings: rural households; small-scale commercial poultry farms (broiler chickens) in Mirzapur, Tangail district; urban food markets in Dhaka
- Study design: baseline survey (no expected size effect; no sample size calculation)

## Ethics and consent
- Written informed consent obtained; right to withdraw at any stage
- Ethical clearance: icddr,b (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037)

## Data collection procedures
- Timing: Round 1 (Feb–Apr 2017); Round 2 (Aug–Oct 2017); water samples from farms/markets (Oct 2018)
- Collectors: trained icddr,b researchers
- Sample handling: samples transported to icddr,b laboratory for analysis

## Laboratory analysis
- E. coli identification: determine resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems via culture microbiology
- Molecular analysis: extract DNA from resistant E. coli; quantify resistance genes blaCTX-M-1 and blaNDM-1 using qPCR
- Documentation: standard operating procedures in supporting documentation
- Conducted by: experienced researchers in the Food and Enteric Microbiology Laboratory, icddr,b

## Quality control and data integrity
- Data capture: paper data sheets or automated lab outputs; manual entry into Excel by data manager
- Verification: random checks against original data; frequency checks to identify and correct out-of-range values
