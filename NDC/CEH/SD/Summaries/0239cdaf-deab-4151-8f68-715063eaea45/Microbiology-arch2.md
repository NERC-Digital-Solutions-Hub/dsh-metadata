# Procedure for enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Purpose and scope
- Standardized protocol to enumerate, isolate, preserve, and identify E. coli isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins or carbapenems from environmental samples.
- Applies to fecal (human and poultry), solid waste, soil, supply water, and wastewater samples collected for the study.
- Aims to produce comparable data for environmental health monitoring and to provide isolates for downstream genetic analysis.

## Materials and media
- PBS solution and sample processing reagents
- Antibiotic-supplemented and chromogenic media: CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar KPC, TBX, and MacConkey agars (with cefotaxime or meropenem)
- Glycerol for cryopreservation; TSB broth
- Oxidase reagent, sterile tools, cryovials, culture dishes
- Media for preparation: 10× PBS, supplement solutions, standard lab plastics and consumables

## Equipment
- Refrigeration and ultra-cold storage (-20 °C, -80 °C)
- Autoclave, water bath (40–100 °C), incubator (36 ± 2 °C), shaker
- Centrifuges and general microbiology workstations as needed

## Procedures (high level)
- Prepare buffers and media:
  - Make 1 L of 10× PBS, then dilute to 1× PBS
  - Prepare 1 L CHROMagar ESBL, 1 L CHROMagar KPC, TBX, and MacConkey media with appropriate antibiotic supplements
  - Prepare supplement solutions for chromogenic media and ensure proper handling and discard after single use
- Sample processing and plate inoculation:
  - For fecal, solid waste, and soil: suspend 1–5 g in PBS, vortex, settle, then plate serial dilutions onto CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar KPC, and TBX
  - For water samples: filter through 0.22 μm membranes, inoculate filters onto CHROMagar ESBL and CHROMagar KPC, incubate with a staged temperature progression
  - For wastewater: perform dilutions, filter through membranes, plate as above
  - Incubate plates at 37 °C for 18–24 h
- Colony selection and sub-culture:
  - Identify presumptive E. coli by colony color (dark pink to reddish on ESBL/KPC and TBX)
  - Pick at least 3 isolated colonies from ESBL and 3 from KPC plates; subculture on MacConkey with cefotaxime or meropenem respectively
  - Create a culture sweep from MacConkey plates and suspend in TSB with 30% glycerol; store at -80 °C
- Confirmation and identification:
  - Use API 20E to confirm presumptive E. coli from each sample
  - If the first isolate tests negative by API 20E, test a second isolate from the same sample
  - API-20E testing steps include oxidase check, inoculation of strip tests (TDA, VP, GEL, etc.), and subsequent interpretation using the Reading Table
  - If API-20E yields unidentifiable results, perform additional tests (nitrate reduction, MacConkey growth) as needed
- Documentation and results:
  - Record sample IDs, plate types, and colony counts
  - Maintain references to API results and any supplementary tests
  - Archive confirmed E. coli isolates for genetic analyses

## Outputs and data management
- Quantitative data: counts of presumptive E. coli colonies on each selective medium per sample
- Qualitative data: API 20E confirmation results and subsequent test outcomes
- Biological material: glycerol-preserved E. coli isolates stored at -80 °C; one confirmed E. coli per sample (with a backup isolate if needed)
- Metadata: sample type, processing conditions, plate IDs, incubation times, and antibiotic concentrations
- Data use: enables downstream genetic analyses and cross-site environmental monitoring comparisons

## Quality control and considerations
- Use standardized media preparation and supplement handling; document lot numbers and storage conditions
- Ensure proper incubation conditions and consistent interpretation of colony coloration
- Retain multiple isolates per sample when possible to increase confirmation success and analytical flexibility
- Follow steps to verify identity beyond initial API 20E result if necessary

## Notes and references
- Emphasis on reproducibility: detailed instructions for media preparation, supplement handling, and API-20E interpretation
- API 20E workflow includes troubleshooting steps for inconclusive results and guidelines for additional testing
- References include Chromogenic media manuals and API 20E identification kit documentation
