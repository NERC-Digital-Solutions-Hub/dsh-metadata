# Standard operating procedure for pH meters and EC/TDS/Temperature Testers NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Overview
- Describes operation procedures for two instruments used in the NERC study:
  - pH meter HI 98127
  - EC/TDS/Temperature Tester HI 98311
- Applicable to measuring water samples and capturing data for downstream analysis.

## Data collection and measurement elements
- Geographical coordinates
  - GPS coordinates recorded with Garmin GPS (Model etrex 10)
  - Readings stored as GIS northing and easting (degrees and minutes) and digital latitude/longitude of the sample point
- pH measurements (HI 98127)
  - pH range: -2.0 to 16.0; accuracy ±0.1 pH
  - Temperature range: -5.0 to 60.0°C (23.0 to 140.0°F)
  - Temperature-compensated pH displayed on primary screen; sample temperature shown on secondary screen
- EC/TDS/Temperature measurements (HI 98311)
  - Conductivity (EC): 0 to 3999 μS/cm; ±2% full scale
  - Total dissolved solids (TDS): 0 to 2000 mg/L; ±2% full scale
  - Temperature: 0.0 to 60.0°C (32.0 to 140.0°F); ±0.5°C / ±1°F
  - EC/TDS value shown on primary screen with temperature-compensated reading; temperature shown on secondary screen

## Measurement procedures
- Turning the device on and checking battery status
  - Hold MODE button to power on; battery life indicator shown for ~1 second
- Taking measurements
  - Submerge sensor/probe in the solution; stir gently
  - Use plastic beakers for EC/TDS to minimize electromagnetic interference
  - For pH: allow reading to stabilize; require stability symbol to disappear
  - For EC/TDS: select EC or TDS mode with SET/HOLD; allow reading to stabilize; readings are temperature-compensated on the primary display; temperature on the secondary display
- Freezing/display hold
  - Press SET/HOLD to freeze the current reading (HOLD appears on the secondary display)
  - To resume, press any button or re-enter normal measuring mode
- General operation notes
  - For pH: maintain measurements within electrode care guidelines; temperature compensation occurs automatically
  - For EC/TDS: ensure correct mode is selected; use stable readings before recording

## Safety, maintenance, and storage
- Electrode handling
  - Glass bulb is sensitive to electrostatic discharge; avoid touching
- Cleaning and storage
  - Rinse electrode with water after use
  - Store with storage solution in protective cap; do not use distilled/deionized water for storage
  - If the electrode is dry, soak in storage solution for at least one hour to reactivate
- Reference manuals
  - HI 98127 pH meter instruction manual
  - HI 98311 EC/TDS/Temperature tester instruction manual
