# Standard operating procedure for pH meters and EC/TDS/Temperature Testers NERC project NE/N019555/1

- Scope and purpose
  - Describes operation procedures for two instruments used in the NERC study: pH meter HI 98127 and EC/TDS/Temperature Tester HI 98311.
  - Specifies measurement ranges and accuracies:
    - pH meter: -2.0 to 16.0 pH; ±0.1 pH; temperature -5.0 to 60.0°C (23.0 to 140°F); temperature-compensated pH displayed on primary LCD; sample temperature on secondary LCD.
    - EC/TDS/Temperature tester: EC 0–3999 µS/cm (±2% F.S.); TDS 0–2000 ppm (±2% F.S.); Temperature 0.0–60.0°C (0–140°F) with ±0.5°C/±1°F accuracy; temperature-compensated readings on primary LCD; sample temperature on secondary LCD.

- Geographical coordinates
  - GPS coordinates of downstream river water samples recorded with Garmin GPS (Model etrex 10) as GIS northing/easting and latitude/longitude.

- pH meter procedure (HI 98127)
  - Turn on and check battery
    - Hold MODE until LCD lights; battery life percent shown (e.g., % 100 BATT).
  - Taking measurements
    - Submerge electrode and stir gently.
    - Read when stability symbol disappears.
    - Primary LCD shows temperature-compensated pH; secondary LCD shows sample temperature.
  - To freeze the display
    - In measurement mode, press SET/HOLD to display HOLD on the secondary LCD; reading freezes (e.g., pH 5.78 HOLD).
    - Press any button to return to normal mode.
  - Safety and maintenance
    - Glass bulb is sensitive to electrostatic discharge; avoid touching.
    - Rinse electrode after use; store with storage solution in protective cap; do not use distilled/deionized water for storage.
    - If left dry, soak in storage solution for at least one hour to reactivate.

- EC/TDS/Temperature tester procedure (HI 98311)
  - Turn on and check battery
    - Hold MODE for 2–3 seconds; battery life percentage shown briefly.
  - Taking measurements
    - Submerge probe in solution.
    - Use plastic beakers to minimize electromagnetic interference.
    - Select EC or TDS mode with SET/HOLD.
    - Read when stability symbol disappears.
    - EC/TDS value is temperature-compensated on the primary LCD; temperature shown on the secondary LCD.
  - To freeze the display
    - Hold SET/HOLD for 2–3 seconds until HOLD appears; press any button to return to normal mode.
