# Antibiotic resistance and resistant genes in bacteria ( Escherichia coli ) from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Aim and scope
- Baseline survey in Bangladesh to assess presence and quantity of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and associated resistance genes.
- Focus on resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.

## Setting and sampling
- Settings: rural households; small-scale commercial poultry farms (broiler chickens) in Mirzapur, Tangail district; urban food markets in Dhaka.
- Sample types: humans (fecal samples); poultry (caecal samples); environment (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/faeces); cattle manure where available.
- Timeframe: first data collection round Feb–Apr 2017 (winter); second round Aug–Oct 2017 (summer); water samples from farms/markets Oct 2018.
- Sample collection performed by trained researchers from icddr,b and analyzed at icddr,b lab.
- Ethical considerations: informed consent obtained; participants could withdraw; approvals from ICDDR,B (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

## Analysis and laboratory methods
- Microbiological analysis: culture-based identification of E. coli with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems; counting of resistant isolates.
- Molecular analysis: DNA extraction from antibiotic-resistant E. coli; qPCR for resistance genes blaCTX-M-1 and blaNDM-1.
- Standard operating procedures provided in supporting documentation; analyses conducted by experienced researchers at the Food and Enteric Microbiology Laboratory, icddr,b.

## Data handling and quality control
- Data capture: mixture of paper records and automated outputs; manual entry into Excel by a data manager.
- Quality assurance: random checks against original data sheets; frequency checks to identify out-of-range or erroneous values with corrections as needed.

## Data structure and documentation

## Outputs, relevance, and data accessibility
- Outputs intended to standardize environmental-health-related data across humans, poultry, and the environment for monitoring and policy evaluation.
- This protocol sets baseline data and methods to enable future monitoring, comparison, and integration with other datasets.
- Data and related materials are prepared for storage and upload to appropriate data portals.
