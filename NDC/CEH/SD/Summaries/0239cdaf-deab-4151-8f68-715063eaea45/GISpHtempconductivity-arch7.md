# Standard operating procedure for pH meters and EC/TDS/Temperature Testers NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Geographic coordinates and data collection context
- GPS coordinates of downstream river water samples recorded with a Garmin GPS (Model etrex 10).
- Readings recorded as GIS northing and easting (degrees and minutes) and digital measures of latitude and longitude of the sample collection point.

## Purpose
- Describe the operation procedure of pH meter (Model HI 98127) for measuring pH of water samples.
- pH meter measures from -2.0 to 16.0 pH with accuracy of ±0.1 pH; temperature range -5.0 to 60.0°C (23.0 to 140.0°F).

## pH meter operation (HI 98127)

- A. Turn on and check the battery status
  - Press and hold MODE until the LCD lights.
  - LCD shows used segments for ~1 second, followed by the battery life indication (e.g., % 100 BATT).

- B. Taking measurements
  - Submerge the electrode in the solution and stir gently.
  - Take measurements when the stability symbol disappears.
  - The pH value is automatically temperature-compensated and shown on the primary LCD; the secondary LCD shows the sample temperature.

- C. To freeze the display
  - While measuring, press the SET/HOLD button.
  - HOLD appears on the secondary display and the reading is frozen (e.g., pH 5.78 HOLD).
  - Press any button to return to normal mode.

## Safety and maintenance (pH meter)
- The glass bulb at the end of the electrode is sensitive to electrostatic discharge; avoid touching the glass bulb.
- Rinse the electrode with water after use and store it with storage solution in the protective cap. Do not use distilled or deionized water for storage.
- If the electrode has been left dry, soak in storage solution for at least one hour to reactivate it.

## Purpose (EC/TDS/Temperature testers)
- Describe the operation procedure of EC/TDS/Temperature Tester (Model HI 98311) for measuring water samples in the NERC Study.
- Device measures:
  - Conductivity (EC) from 0 to 3999 µS/cm with accuracy ±2% F.S.
  - Total dissolved solids (TDS) from 0 to 2000 ppm (mg/L) with accuracy ±2% F.S.
  - Temperature from 0.0 to 60.0°C (32.0 to 140.0°F) with accuracy ±0.5°C / ±1°F.

## EC/TDS/Temperature tester operation (HI 98311)

- A. Turn on and check the battery status
  - Press and hold the MODE button for 2-3 seconds.
  - All used segments appear briefly, followed by the battery life indication (e.g., % 100 BATT).

- B. Taking measurements
  - Submerge the probe in the solution.
  - Use plastic beakers to minimize electromagnetic interference.
  - Select EC or TDS mode with the SET/HOLD button.
  - Take measurements when the stability symbol disappears.
  - The EC/TDS value is automatically temperature compensated; the secondary LCD shows the sample temperature.

- C. To freeze the display
  - Press the SET/HOLD button for 2-3 seconds until HOLD appears on the secondary display.
  - Press any button to return to normal measuring mode.
