# Purpose To describe the sampling strategy and procedures for sample collection of human faecal, poultry caecal and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) in the study Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh.

## Overview of study design
- Aimed to assess AMR transmission dynamics across environmental and human sources in urban and rural Bangladesh.
- Sampling conducted in two rounds to capture seasonal variation: Round 1 in winter and Round 2 in summer.
- Settings and sample scope:
  - Urban live poultry markets
  - Commercial poultry farms
  - Rural households with domestic poultry
- Each setting sampled in parallel across rounds, with both high- and low-exposure groups where applicable.
- Types of samples collected include human faecal samples, poultry cloacal samples, poultry pen litter, and a range of environmental samples (drinking water, wastewater, pond/surface water, river water, soil, animal manure, solid waste).

## Sampling plan by setting

- Urban poultry markets
  - Round 1: 20 markets; select one live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder per market.
  - Round 2: 20 additional markets (total 40 markets).
  - Samples: human stool; poultry cloacal swabs; floors and surfaces of poultry pens; water supply (drinking water) and wastewater (drains downstream of markets); solid waste disposal sites.
- Commercial poultry farms
  - Round 1: 20 small-to-medium broiler farms; at least one farm worker per farm; one non-poultry-exposed healthy adult from same village as low-exposure comparison.
  - Round 2: 20 additional farms (total 40).
  - Samples: human stool; farm drinking water; poultry caecal samples; mixed poultry pen feces; downstream wastewater, pond/canal, and river water.
- Rural villages
  - Round 1: 20 households (10 villages, 2 households per village) with one high-exposure poultry-owning household and one low-exposure non-poultry-owning household per village.
  - Round 2: 20 additional households (total 40 households in 20 villages).
  - Samples: human stool (adult women); tubewell drinking water; soil from household compounds; poultry caecal samples (in poultry-owning households); animal manure; downstream wastewater and river water.
- NERC study specifics
  - Data collection replicated in Round 2 with additional households/villages (40 households total; 40 markets; 40 farms).

## Summary of sample types and counts
- Human faecal samples
  - Rural households: N=40 (high exposure with poultry; low exposure without poultry)
  - Farms: N=40 (high exposure poultry workers; low exposure non-farm workers)
  - Urban markets: N=40 (high exposure live poultry market stalls; low exposure fruit/vegetable market stalls)
- Poultry cloacal samples
  - Rural households: N=40 (high exposure with poultry)
  - Farms: N=40 (high exposure, low exposure)
  - Urban markets: N=40 (high exposure, low exposure)
- Poultry pen litter
  - Rural households: N=40
  - Farms: N=40
  - Urban markets: N=40
- Poultry drinking water (from water feeders)
  - Farms: high exposure; low exposure
  - Urban markets: high exposure; low exposure
  - Rural households: no high-exposure sample reported
- Animal manure
  - Rural households: high exposure; low exposure
  - Farms: high exposure; low exposure
  - Urban markets: no high-exposure sample reported
- Soil from compound
  - Rural households: high exposure; low exposure
  - Farms: high exposure; low exposure
  - Urban markets: no high-exposure sample reported
- Water samples
  - Water supply (tubewell) and other water types (tap water, downstream river water, pond water, wastewater, etc.) across settings; counts align with the 40-market/40-farm/40-household structure
- Solid waste and waste water
  - Integrated in market and farm settings; detailed sampling locations and pooling described
- Notes
  - Some data show high exposure vs. low exposure distinctions based on poultry ownership or farm/worker status
  - Several sample types indicate pooling and collection from multiple sub-locations within a site

## Sampling procedures and handling

- General handling
  - All samples transported on ice and processed in the laboratory within 12–24 hours of collection.
  - Sterile collection practices and gloves used for all sampling steps.
  - Where applicable, samples pooled from multiple points and placed in labeled sterile containers or bags; cool box used for transport.
- GPS and environmental measurements
  - Downstream river sample locations recorded with GPS coordinates.
  - pH, temperature, and conductivity measured for river/related downstream water samples.
- Specific sample collection procedures
  - Soil samples
    - Choose a high-traffic area (e.g., near kitchen/front door).
    - Use fresh gloves; collect ~0.5 inch depth, ~20 g soil.
    - Store on ice; preserve a portion in LifeGuard solution for molecular processing.
  - Solid waste samples
    - Collect from three locations around waste dumping areas near markets in pooled ~20 g samples.
    - Use fresh gloves; avoid sharp objects; pool and mix thoroughly.
    - Cool box transport to laboratory.
  - Waste water samples
    - Collect from three points along the run-off drain (~150 ml per point).
    - Pool into a 500 ml labeled sterile bottle; cool box transport.
  - River/pond/surface water samples
    - Use sterile bottle; sample ~30 cm below surface, fill completely.
    - Cap tightly; cool box transport.
  - Water supply/tubewell
    - Operate hand pump for 5 minutes; pre-clean/sterilize pump mouth with heat.
    - Collect 500 ml aseptically as water flows into sterile bottle; cool box transport.
  - Tap water
    - Clean nozzle with 70% alcohol; run water for 1 minute; flame sterilize outside nozzle.
    - Collect 500 ml; cap securely; cool box transport.
  - Human stool samples
    - Provide container to participant; collect within 2 hours; store on ice.
  - Poultry pen litter
    - Collect from three floor areas; pool ~20 g; mix; ensure no sharp objects; cool box transport.
  - Animal manure
    - Collect ~20 g fresh manure with sterile spoon; label; cool box transport.
  - Poultry caecal samples
    - From randomly selected slaughtered chickens; extract caecal sample and process in laboratory.

## Data handling and transparency
- Data and samples are processed to ensure quality, with clear documentation of collection sites, exposure status, and sample types.
- The plan emphasizes timely processing, appropriate storage, and linkage between environmental and human sampling to assess AMR transmission pathways.
