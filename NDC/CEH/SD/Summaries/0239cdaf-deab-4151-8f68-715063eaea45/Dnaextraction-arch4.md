# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- Describes procedures for extracting DNA from environmental samples (soil, water, stool) and bacterial isolates.
- Documents kits and methods used (Qiagen DNeasy PowerSoil, DNeasy PowerWater, QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit) and a heat-lysis approach for bacterial isolates.

## Methods
- DNA extraction kits and approaches:
  - DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (soil)
  - DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit (water)
  - QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (stool)
  - Heat-lysis DNA extraction for bacterial isolates
- General precautions and safety practices outlined (gloves, avoid skin contact with reagents, refer to MSDS, handle flammable reagents away from flames).

## General Precautions
- Avoid skin contact with reagents; wear gloves; follow universal precautions.
- Consult Material Safety Data Sheets for emergency procedures.
- Keep flammable reagents (e.g., ethanol) away from open flames and sparks.

## Kit and Extracted DNA storage
- Store extracted DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C) for long-term storage.
- Kit reagents should be stored at room temperature (15–30°C).

## DNA extraction from soil samples by DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit
- Equipment and setup: pipettors, microcentrifuge (10,000 x g), vortex, vortex adapter; PowerBead Tubes with soil.
- Key workflow (high-level):
  - Add ~0.25 g soil to PowerBead Tube; mix; check and dissolve precipitated Solution C1 if needed.
  - Process with C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5 as directed, including timed incubations and centrifugations.
  - Pass the supernatant through a spin filter; perform elution with Solution C6 or water.
  - Final DNA ready for downstream applications; store frozen.
- Output: Purified DNA suitable for downstream analyses.

## DNA extraction from water samples by DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit
- Equipment: filter funnels, vacuum system, centrifuge capable of 13,000 x g, vortex, and MB Spin Column components.
- Key workflow (high-level):
  - Filter water; prepare and lyse beads with Solution PW1 (warm).
  - Bind, wash, and elute DNA through MB Spin Column using PW solutions (PW3–PW6) with specified centrifugation steps.
  - Final elution and DNA ready for downstream applications; store frozen.
- Output: Purified environmental DNA from water samples.

## DNA extraction from stool samples by QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit
- Preparation: weigh 180–220 mg stool; homogenize with Buffer ASL; heat and centrifuge to remove debris.
- Inhibitor removal: add InhibitEX tablet to bind inhibitors; separate cleared lysate.
- Lysis and binding: add Proteinase K, Buffer AL, and ethanol; apply lysate to QIAamp spin column; perform sequential washes (AW1, AW2) and dry spin.
- Elution: elute DNA with Buffer AE; store frozen.
- Output: Purified microbial DNA from stool suitable for downstream analyses.

## Preparation of Template DNA
- Prepare template DNA from a culture by suspending a loopful in autoclaved water; boil, chill on ice, clarify by centrifugation.
- Collect supernatant for storage; store at -20°C to -80°C for later use.
