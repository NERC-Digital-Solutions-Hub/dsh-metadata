# To identify loci that contribute to discrimination between males of related species

- Objective: Identify genomic loci that influence discrimination between males of D. simulans and D. sechellia by genotyping female progeny from a D. sechellia backcross in a two-choice mate assay.
- Experimental design:
  - Two-choice mating test with three tester females and three tester males from each species, all eclosing on the same day.
  - Females aged 3–28 days; males aged 7–28 days; kept in groups of three of the same sex per vial without yeast.
  - The assay runs up to four hours or until copulation occurs; once mating occurs, the vial is frozen for later analysis.
  - Species of the copulating male determined by distinct male genitalia.
- Genotype and trait data:
  - ID column: library ID plus a unique barcode.
  - pheno: 0 = female mated with D. simulans males; 1 = female mated with D. sechellia males.
  - Genomic locations correspond to specific sites in the D. simulans genome (Hu et al. 2013).
  - Parental references: D. simulans A2A2B (Tsimbazaza) and D. sechellia D1A1C (D. sechellia 13).
  - Genotypes obtained via Multiplexed Shotgun Genotyping (Andolfatto et al., 2011).
  - Data thinning performed with pull_thin (Stern’s script).
- Data quality and filtering:
  - Low DNA content can yield incomplete/poor genotype calls.
  - Exclude individuals with more than 25% ambiguous calls (NA).
  - Some columns indicate BB (sim/sim), BA (sech/sim), NA (data not available).
- Data interpretation and structure (for visualization/presentation):
  - Columns reflect genotypes at various genomic locations; analysis seeks loci associated with mating discrimination.
  - Reference to genome coordinates and parental haplotypes enables mapping results onto a genome-wide view.
- Practical notes for GIS-like data handling:
  - Treat genomic coordinates as spatial features; phenotypic outcome (pheno) as an attribute layer linked to genotype data.
  - Use parental genomes as basemaps and genotype calls as categorical attributes (BB, BA, NA).
