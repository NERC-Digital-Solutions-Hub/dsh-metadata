# Overland flow in the tree planted shelter belt

## Introduction
- Two overland flow traps (OLF) installed in the tree planted shelter belt (each 5 m x 5 m).
- Observation: despite proximity, differences in soil texture between traps.
- Monitoring during 12/04 – 21/04: OLF as a percentage of rainfall measured at RG3 was 15.9% (Trap 1) and 4.2% (Trap 2); bowl area recorded 19.75% in the same period.

## Data collection and measurements
- Baseline monitoring logs include multiple maintenance and observation notes from 2006–2009.
- Data points mention various events affecting data collection (blockages, leaks, calibration, timestamp alignment) and occasional changes in measurement setups (tipping bucket systems introduced).

## Equipment and setup history
- 04/04/06: OLF Trap 2 gutter guide plastic damaged; reinserted by cutting slit; soil compacted to seal seam; OLF 1 & 2 gutters cleared.
- 21/04/06: Gutters in OLF cleared of leaf litter.
- 02/08/06: Downstream elements (downslope) noted; grounds uneven; bucket status described.
- 27/09/06: Gutter guide plastic replaced with stainless steel strips on OLF 1 and 2.
- 08/03/07: Gutters cleared of leaves and soil.
- 29/08/08: Tipping bucket (TB) monitoring systems installed for OLF in the tree shelter belts.
- 04/09/08: Trap 1 blocked; unblocked around 1200 GMT; measures taken to stop blockages.
- 06/10/08: TB1 blocked; bottom of collection gutter dislodged.
- 10/10/08: TB1 reinstalled.
- 31/11/08: TB1 calibrated (169.5 ml/tip); TB4 calibrated for TB2 (185.2 ml/tip).
- 02/12/08: Trap 1 tiny tag failure; replaced with a tiny tag logger; suggestion to use plastic bags for protection.
- 20/02/09: Downpipe leak in Trap 1 discovered; repaired and reinstalled (20/02/09).
- 17/02/09–13/03/09: Noted odd runoff in Trap 1; data quality concerns with last monitoring period.
- 06/04/09: Time stamp issue suspected due to BST/GMT change; adjusted in analysed data.

## Data quality and issues
- Time stamp inconsistencies during data downloads and between successive records.
- Suspected BST/GMT shifts affecting timestamps; corrections applied during analysis.
- Leak in Trap 1 downpipe (02/09) raises questions about data quality for the latest monitoring period.
- Tiny tag logger failures (02/12/08) and dampness-related issues (02/12/08) requiring replacements and protective measures.
- Occasional blockage and debris causing irregular runoff and gaps in data (e.g., TB1/TB2 blockages, dislodged gutters).

## Calibrations and data processing notes
- Calibration of tipping buckets:
  - TB1: 169.5 ml per tip
  - TB4 (for TB2): 185.2 ml per tip
- Data interpretation notes include adjustments to timing to maintain continuity with previous records when timestamp issues were detected.

## Current status and recommendations
- The setup should be checked after rainfall events to ensure continued accuracy and avoid blockages or leaks influencing measurements.
- Covers installed over gutters to prevent direct rainfall from impacting measurements.
- Data quality concerns require ongoing QA: verify timestamps (GMT/BST), confirm sensor integrity, and adjust analyses accordingly.
- Consider integrating OLF data with rainfall data from RG3 and reviewing early prototype outputs to promote wider sharing and reuse of findings.
