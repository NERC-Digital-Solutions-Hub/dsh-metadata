# Hillslope tensiometers

- Overview
  - A detailed field log of tensiometer maintenance, data collection, and data quality issues from 2004–2009 across the hillslope and shelterbelt transects.
  - Measurements involve tensiometers at multiple depths (notably 10 cm and 30 cm) and Delta-T logging, with periodic degassing, recalibration, and reinstallation.
  - Observations include significant data management challenges and frequent environmental interference affecting data integrity.

- Data collection setup
  - Tensiometers deployed at multiple transects (e.g., shelter belt and hillslope areas), with periodic reinstallation in new holes and at different depths.
  - Delta-T logger used for data download; occasional limits or outages noted.
  - Permeameter measurements conducted in some periods; associated data logged.
  - Depths primarily around 10 cm (and other specified depths) with adjustments over time (e.g., new holes, reorientation to 15° angles in some deployments).

- Chronology of key maintenance and replacements
  - 2004–2005: Routine maintenance including degassing; several notes of grass cutting and minor adjustments.
  - 2006: Frequent degassing and reinstallation; multiple notes on vent checks, data gaps, and occasional logger issues.
  - 2007: Numerous disruptions including:
    - 29/03–01/04/07: data in this period not correct; 1/04/07 onward, data quality/offset concerns noted.
    - 11/04/07: Delta-T downloaded; continued degassing and reinstallation.
    - 22/08/07–29/11/07: rodent/animal interference and extensive repairs; multiple tensiometer replacements; logger box/battery issues; data gaps.
  - 2008: Intensified repairs and recalibrations:
    - 02/09/08: adjustments to sensor offset (15° orientation change; offset updated from -5 hPa to -4.8 hPa for outside-tree-area tensiometers).
    - 16/10/08 and 31/10/08: sensor replacement (e.g., 2.2.10, 3.2.10) and grass cutting; external battery issues noted.
  - 2009: Post-collection data processing notes:
    - 25/03–02/04/09 and 06/04/09; several dates indicating ongoing data management and recording; explicit note that a post-collection correction was applied to address offset/polarity changes introduced around 01/04/07–01/05/07, with a plan to apply a +10 cm offset to counter earlier misalignment. See accompanying spreadsheets for details.

- Data quality issues and corrections
  - Missing and corrupted data periods:
    - 11/05–02/06: data missing for several tensiometers.
    - 04/05/06: data loss due to logger auto-wrap (start of sampling period lost).
    - 29/03/07–01/04/07: data not correct; a known problematic window.
    - 29/10/08–late 2008: logger not logging; external battery failures and other outages noted.
  - Sensor and electronics problems:
    - Frequent degassing, vent blockages (e.g., earthworms), and sensor recalibrations.
    - Repeated wiring/cable issues (chewed wires, damaged tubes), and battery/board failures in loggers.
    - Fuse failures, logger box failures, and occasional pump/relay issues affecting data continuity.
  - Data integrity and processing notes:
    - 01/04/07–01/05/07: logger rewired causing polarity/offset changes; data needed post-collection corrections.
    - Offsets and polarity changes:
      - Initial offset of -5 cm applied to tensiometer readings; polarity reversal occurred with rewiring around 01/04/07–01/05/07.
      - A plan to apply +5 cm offset to revert, and ultimately a post-collection process applying a +10 cm adjustment to align data to a zero-offset baseline.
      - 04/12/08 note: after data download, the offset on all tensios was set to 0 (previously -5 cm); this requires downstream consistency adjustments.
    - 16/09/08–02/09/08: offset and orientation changes for outside-tree-area sensors; tree-area sensors retained prior orientation and offset.
    - Spreadsheets referenced for detailed, sensor-specific correction values and histories.

- External disturbances affecting measurements
  - Animal interference and habitat changes:
    - Mole hills around tensiometers in cages (notably near shelter belt transects).
    - Rodent activity damaging wires and vent tubes, and chewed wiring for multiple sensors.
    - Badger-related disturbance in tree shelterbelt areas in 2008–2009.
  - Vegetation and site maintenance:
    - Regular grass cutting and debris clearing around cages; some debris issues (litter, soil) affecting sensor housings and vent access.
  - Environmental observations:
    - Qualitative note that streams on the site were drier in the later period compared with 1976 observations, implying hydrological context for the data.

- Data processing, metadata, and downstream use
  - Recurring need to clean and re-insert sensors, re-calculate offsets, and update the logger programs after hardware or polarity changes.
  - Post-collection data corrections emphasized, with explicit mention to consult spreadsheets for detailed correction schemes and sensor-by-sensor adjustments.
  - Emphasis on documenting all changes (sensor replacements, depth changes, offset/polarity updates) to ensure interpretability and reproducibility of self-serve data products.

- Observations and context
  - Field notes reflect ongoing struggles to maintain continuous, high-quality data streams in a harsh outdoor environment.
  - Despite challenges, the dataset contains extensive longitudinal records of tensiometer readings across depths and locations, with documented attempts to preserve data integrity through maintenance, recalibration, and post-processing corrections.
