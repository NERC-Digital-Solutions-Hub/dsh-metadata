# Overland flow in the tree planted shelter belt

- Study/setup
  - Two overland flow (OLF) traps installed in a 5 m x 5 m tree planted shelter belt.
  - Observations noted that traps, despite proximity, showed differences in soil texture.
  - Rainfall data used from RG3; OLF as a percentage of rainfall recorded.
  - Early data (04/12–04/21 period) showed Trap 1 > 15.9% and Trap 2 4.2%, compared with 19.75% in the bowl area for the same period.

- Data and measurements (selected highlights)
  - 04/04/06: OLF trap2 gutter guide plastic ~50 cm detached; repaired by cutting into soil, reinserted, and covered with soil.
  - 21/04/06: Cleaned gutters; top lawn-edging reinserted; leaf litter cleared behind.
  - 02/08/06 to 29/08/08: Various maintenance events including cleaning gutters, removing litter/soil, and noticing plastic vs. metal components.
  - 08/03/07 onward: Upgrades and maintenance to reduce blockage; covers placed to prevent direct rain entry.
  - 31/11/08: Calibrated tipping bucket (TB) systems: TB5 for Trap 1 (169.5 ml/tip) and TB4 for Trap 2 (185.2 ml/tip).
  - 02/12/08: Trap 1 tag issue suspected (dampness); replaced with a tiny tag logger; suggestion to protect loggers in plastic bags.
  - 17–20/02/09: Leak detected in the Trap 1 downpipe; fixed and reinstalled.
  - 13/03/09 and 06/04/09: Ongoing concerns about odd runoff responses and potential time-stamp issues, with DST-related adjustments noted.

- Equipment and maintenance notes
  - Regular gutter clearing and reinforcement (e.g., stainless steel strips installed in place of plastic).
  - Reconnection and cleaning of barrels/pipes; monitoring sensors (tipping buckets) installed and recalibrated.
  - Acknowledgement of potential data reliability problems due to physical issues (leaks, blockages, time-stamp discrepancies).

- Data quality, provenance, and metadata considerations
  - Time-stamp issues and overlapping data during downloads; some records require clock adjustments (GMT to BST) to align data streams.
  - Observed leaks and blockages potentially affecting flow readings; noted as needing check after rain.
  - Calibration values for TB1 and TB4 documented; potential data quality caveat for last monitoring period due to hardware issues.
  - Tag/datalogger dampness concerns leading to replacements and protective measures (plastic bags suggestion).

- Implications for data leadership and governance
  - Highlights the need for robust data provenance: equipment changes, calibration records, and maintenance logs to accompany flow data.
  - Importance of metadata standards around time stamps, DST adjustments, and data quality flags.
  - Necessity for clear procedures to verify data integrity after hardware incidents (leaks, blockages, sensor failures).
  - Coordination of data collection with field maintenance to minimize data gaps and ensure consistent baselines across traps.

- Next steps / recommendations
  - Implement consistent timestamp normalization and DST handling; maintain a metadata log for all calibrations and hardware changes.
  - Establish data quality flags to mark periods impacted by leaks, blockages, or sensor issues.
  - Schedule post-rain system checks to confirm setup integrity and prevent recurrent data gaps.
  - Continue documenting soil texture differences and their potential impact on flow readings to interpret spatial variability.
