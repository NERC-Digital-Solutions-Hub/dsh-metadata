# Introduction to the Database Catalogue

- The Equipment & Methods section documents borehole drilling, groundwater monitoring, and associated data collection at the Pontbren/Llanfair Caereinion study area, including installation and logging of N-probes NP20–NP23.
- Data are produced by a CEH-led project with fieldwork conducted by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd, and are intended to support hydrogeological and soil-moisture analyses.

## Equipment and procedures

- Drilling and sampling tools:
  - Hand auger with AQ drill rod/guide tube
  - Pneumatic hammer
  - Atlas Copco RAB handheld air-flush rotary drill
- Logging and access:
  - BOREHOLE LOG sheets capturing lithology, depth, and completion details
  - Completion tubing described (16 gauge, aluminum; various depths)
  - Samples collected at defined depth intervals (e.g., 0.25–1.60 m ranges)
- Site and data organization:
  - Logs associated with specific N-probes and manipulation plots
  - Datum levels and grid references recorded for each borehole
  - Documentation repeatedly notes “Carried out for Centre for Ecology and Hydrology” and includes sheet-by-sheet descriptions

## N-probes and borehole records

- NP20 (Site S3 easternmost): detailed lithology progression from surface to deeper intervals; multiple entries capture soil descriptions, depths, and completion details
- NP21 (Site S3 central): similar depth sequence and lithology descriptions; multiple logs with depth and material changes
- NP22 (Site S3 westernmost): borehole log with progressive lithology, from humic surface soils to stiff, gravelly clays and sandstone fragments
- NP23 (COED CWM-Y-LLWYNOG, LLANFAIR CAEREINION): deeper log with multiple lithologies, including humic soils, mottling in clays, and gravelly/clayey transitions
- For all NP logs: notes include grid references, datum level, and dates (e.g., 14/05/06); emphasis on detailed soil descriptions and material transitions

## Site context and field teams

- Locations span Pen-Tal-Y-Cein, Llanfair Caereinion, with specific manipulation plots (e.g., Tyn y Fron, Trees edge of wood) and Site S3 variations ( easternmost, central, westernmost )
- N-probes positioned at varying depths (typically shallow to ~1.5 m in the logs) to characterize near-surface soil properties
- Field documentation includes precise grid references (e.g., SJ coordinates) and site plan references to accompany borehole entries

## Data formats, quality, and provenance

- Primary outputs are borehole logs (BOREHOLE LOG) with descriptive lithology, depths, and completion details
- Logs include explicit depth intervals, thickness, and material descriptions (e.g., silty clay, clayey gravel, sandstone fragments)
- Documentation notes the involvement of Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd and CEH, with standardized sheet-based data capture
- Data are intended to be discoverable with rich metadata to support reuse and reproducibility

## Streamflow and ancillary measurements (Appendix D)

- Appendices include streamflow gauging site data with flow metered spot measurements
- For each entry: start/finish times and flow metered estimates (in liters per second), across multiple sites (Sites 3–13, among others)
- Measurements reflect calibration/validation efforts, and are used to support hydrological modeling and cross-site comparisons

## Practical use for analysts

- The detailed borehole logs and N-probe records provide ground-truth lithology and groundwater context to inform hydrological and soil-moisture models
- The combination of site-specific logs, date-stamped data, and accompanying streamflow measurements enables calibration of hydraulic models and assessment of subsurface controls on flow and soil-water dynamics
- Metadata, provenance, and consistent formatting support data integration, reproducibility, and reuse in analytical workflows
