# Hillslope tensiometers

- Long-running field monitoring of soil water potential using tensiometers across hillslope and shelterbelt transects.
- Measurements collected with Delta-T data loggers, spanning depths such as 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm, and other cage/positioned sites (e.g., T2.2.10, T3.3.50).
- Regular maintenance and site interventions documented: degassing, reinstallation, grass cutting, vent checks, battery changes, and calibration/offset adjustments.

- Frequent data quality issues and interruptions:
  - Periods of degassed tensiometers leading to abnormal readings.
  - Data gaps due to logger downtime, missed downloads, battery failures, or external power issues.
  - Equipment problems including damaged or chewed tubes/wires, probes with anomalous readings, and sensor failures.
  - Data integrity problems from clock/logging errors, auto-wraps, and changes in data offset conventions.
  - Periods of data not being recorded (e.g., 29/03/07–01/05/07; late 2007–early 2008).

- Maintenance and corrective actions:
  - Reinstallation of tensiometers in original or new holes, sometimes at adjusted depths or angles (notably 10 cm and 30 cm depths; adjusted orientation to 15°).
  - Regular degassing campaigns and vent checks; extensive cleaning of gutters/olf traps; addressing mole/rodent interference.
  - Replacement and calibration of tensiometers, including serial-number-based tracking (e.g., T2.2.10, T3.3.50).
  - Delta-T logger issues diagnosed and resolved (e.g., battery problems, fuse/connectivity issues, relay loose, external power source problems).
  - Post-collection data corrections to align offsets and sign conventions (e.g., changing offset from -5 to 0 cm; applying +10 cm corrections in subsequent processing).

- Data handling and metadata considerations:
  - Documentation includes detailed event-by-event notes (dates, times, locations, depths, and actions taken).
  - Use of serial numbers and site identifiers to track devices and deployments.
  - Observations about data integrity requiring post-hoc transformations (offset corrections, sign changes) to ensure consistency across the time series.
  - Attention to ensuring data availability for downstream analyses, with explicit notes when data were missing or questionable.

- Observed broader challenges relevant to monitoring frameworks:
  - Environmental monitoring is vulnerable to biological interference (moles, rodents) and weather/field conditions (grass growth, soil movement).
  - Technical fragility of field sensors and data loggers necessitates robust maintenance protocols and clear documentation for reproducibility.
  - Need for consistent metadata standards (sensor IDs, depths, locations, deployment details) to enable data sharing, audit, and reanalysis.
  - Importance of establishing data governance practices to address data gaps, quality flags, and post-processing corrections.
