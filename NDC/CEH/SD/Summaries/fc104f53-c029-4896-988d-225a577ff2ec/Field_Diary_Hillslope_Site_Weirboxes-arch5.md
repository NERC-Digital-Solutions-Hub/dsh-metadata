# This file is for the weir boxes that are measuring drain and overland flow in the bowl. They were installed on 01/11/06.

## Overview
- Purpose: Monitor drain flow (DRAIN) and overland flow (OLF) in a bowl; installation date 01/11/06.
- Initial positions relative to the v-notch: DRAIN flow weir box ~23.33 mm above the v-notch; OLF weir box ~106 mm below the v-notch.
- Data collection setup: logger with relating sensors; occasional maintenance on wiring and transducers.
- General status: frequent data downloads and ongoing field maintenance documented from 2006–2008.

## Data Collection and Equipment
- DRAIN and OLF weirs: measured cross-sectional areas around 0.52 m² each (DRAIN 75.2 cm x 69.2 cm; OLF ~74.5–75.1 cm x 69.1–69.2 cm on average).
- V-notch measurements: DRAIN average V length 212.5 mm (CV 2.99%); OLF average V length 211 mm (CV 1.3%).
- Water depth observations at download times: DRAIN average depth ~112 mm; depth above V-notch ~37.3 mm (DRAIN flow ~111 mm referenced in context).
- Transducers and wiring: pressure transducer installed for OLF; several wiring issues noted and corrected over time.
- Notable adjustments: plastic guides extended to gutter/trench area to improve guidance of OLF water; soil conditions described as crumbly in several entries.

## Data Quality and QC
- 08/11/06: OLF weir box leaking; leak investigated by removing the weir box and inspecting.
- 23/11/06–29/11/06: multiple fixes; OLF weir box repaired; wiring issues for a belt/wiring noted and addressed.
- 03/01/07–08/03/07: OLF zero readings and physical adjustments to improve reliability; material improvements to guide water; soil stability concerns.
- 18/04/07–30/04/07: evaporation causing drop below V-notch; surface disturbances from animal activity (moles/voles) affecting OLF trap.
- 12/12/07: sediment buildup in OLF gutter; down pipe cleared.
- 23/01/08–30/01/08: observed data plausibility issues vs field observations; logger dryness noted; down pipe blockage cleared.
- 13/03/08: gap in data from 03/03/08 to 13/03/08; file integrity questioned (same data as prior download).
- 15/08/08: final note of data “jump” after last download on 30/07/08; indicates data anomalies post-maintenance and data transfer.

## Data Management and Accessibility
- Regular data downloads from the logger recorded (dates include 08/11/06, 22/11/06, 23/01/08, 30/01/08, 13/03/08, 15/08/08).
- Occasional recalibration/zeroing and reinstallation steps documented to maintain continuity of time-series data.
- Observations note potential data integrity issues (blockages, evaporation effects, and data file anomalies) impacting data interpretation.

## Maintenance and Repairs
- 08/11/06–14/11/06: OLF weir box leak investigation and removal for inspection.
- 22/11/06: Reinstalled OLF pressure transducer.
- 23/11/06: Leak location around the stilling well identified; box dried and repaired.
- 27/11/06: Loose wire fixed after last download indicated issue.
- 29/11/06: Reinstalled OLF weir box; zero-set in relation to reference height.
- 02/05/07–04/05/07: OLF trap and surrounding structure repaired; roofing material pegged to soil due to instability.
- 07/06/07: Internal area measurements completed to refine cross-sectional calculations.
- 12/12/07–30/01/08: sediment and blockage management; gutters and down pipes cleared to restore flow paths.
- 03/03/08–13/03/08: data gap noted and investigation into file integrity.

## Notable Issues and Anomalies
- Leaks in OLF weir box (late 2006) and subsequent repairs.
- Regularly observed blockages in OLF/downpipe affecting data plausibility.
- Evaporation causing V-notch water levels to drop, reducing measurable flow.
- Animal disturbance (molehills/vole activity) impacting trap stability.
- Data gaps (03/03/08–13/03/08) and a data jump anomaly reported in August 2008.
- Occasional discrepancies between field observations (overland flow) and recorded hill-slope data, prompting checks for blockages and logger status.

## Metadata and Documentation
- Documented physical dimensions and areas of both weirs to support flow calculations.
- Clear notes on positioning relative to V-notch, calibration state, and zeroing references.
- Logs include dates, times (GMT), and concise descriptions of events, issues, actions taken, and data status.

## Summary of Status
- The system underwent ongoing maintenance and encountered multiple data quality challenges between 2006 and 2008.
- By the last entry (15/08/08), data anomalies continued to be noted after prior downloads, with a major data jump occurring after 30/07/08.
- Overall readiness for long-term discovery and use relies on continued QC of blockages, evaporation effects, wiring integrity, and consistent data integrity checks.
