# Hillslope tensiometers

- Overview
  - A comprehensive field log (2004–2009) of hillslope tensiometer deployments, maintenance, and data issues across multiple transects (shelter belt and hillslope) and depths. Documents degassing, re-installations, sensor replacements, calibration adjustments, and periodic data gaps to support GIS-based analysis of soil moisture dynamics.

- Data collection & equipment
  - Regular degassing and vent checks; cages and trenches near shelter belt; tensiometers deployed at varying depths (e.g., 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) and at multiple transects (e.g., transects 1.1, 2.2, 3.3).
  - Use of Delta-T data loggers with periodic downloads; battery and power management repeatedly noted.
  - Frequent sensor replacements and reinsertions due to high readings, loose connections, or damage (e.g., mole/rodent disturbances); some tensiometers reinstalled in different holes or angles (often ~15 degrees) to improve stability.
  - Noted significant maintenance events:
    - Replacements and recalibrations (e.g., tensiometers 1.2.10, 2.2.10, 3.2.10, 3.3.50, etc.).
    - Installation of new tensiometers and relocation due to soil disturbance (e.g., badgers, mole hills).
    - Periodic cutting of grass and cleaning of gutters to reduce interference.
  - Notable equipment issues:
    - Logs mention broken or chewed wiring, water in lines, and sensor readings outside expected ranges.
    - Logger and battery problems: logger box failures, low or failing batteries, and periods when logging ceased or data were not recorded.

- Data quality, gaps, and corrections
  - Early observations include abnormal readings attributed to tensiometer degassing.
  - Data gaps occurred at several intervals:
    - 11/05 – 02/06 (missing data)
    - 01/04/07 – 01/05/07 (data issues after calibration/rewiring)
    - 29/03/07 – 01/04/07 and other short periods due to logger or wiring issues
    - Late 2008 – early 2009 periods with non-logging events (external power/battery problems)
  - Data processing adjustments:
    - Initial offsets used in data were -5 cm; after download in 04/12/08, all tensios were reset to an offset of 0.
    - 2009 notes indicate plan to apply a compensating +10 cm offset to earlier data to counter the previous -5 cm offset, and to apply corresponding adjustments in the dataset (see spreadsheets for details).
  - Calibration and offset implications:
    - Recalibration efforts and multiple reinstallation events sometimes changed offset and depth relationships, requiring post-collection processing to standardize.

- Disturbances and maintenance events
  - Biotic disturbances:
    - Mole hills and rodent activity causing damage to cages, wires, and tubes; several instances of chewed wires and tensed tubes.
  - Physical interventions:
    - Holes re-dug and tensiometers reinstalled; some sites relocated to new holes or adjusted orientation (often at a 15° tilt) to maintain sensor integrity.
  - Operational interruptions:
    - Delta-T downloads interrupted by outages; logger relays and connectors becoming loose; external battery failures resulting in loggers stopping.
  - Environmental management:
    - Grass cutting and litter/soil cleaning to reduce interference with sensors and data transmission.

- Spatial and temporal scope
  - Sensors and data span multiple transects and shelterbelt zones, including:
    - Hillslope areas and shelter belt; various transects with labels such as T2.2.10, T3.3.50, etc.
    - Depths including 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm measurements.
  - Timeframe covers 2004–2009 with numerous maintenance cycles, data checks, and corrections documented throughout.

- Notable observations and context
  - Contextual note from 2006: reference to drier streams in the study area compared with historical conditions (1960s–1970s) indicating hydrological variability impacting sensor readings and field management.
  - Final entries highlight ongoing vulnerability of sensors to biotic interference and the necessity for ongoing calibration and offset management to maintain data consistency for GIS analyses.

- End status and key takeaway
  - The data record is highly iterative, with frequent maintenance, sensor replacements, and corrections to ensure data quality.
  - Significant emphasis on metadata regarding sensor identity, deployment depth, transect location, offset adjustments, and periods of non-logging essential for accurate GIS integration and longitudinal analyses.
