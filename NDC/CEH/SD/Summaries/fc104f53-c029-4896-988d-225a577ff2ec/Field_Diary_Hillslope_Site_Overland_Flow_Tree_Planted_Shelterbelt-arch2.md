# Overland flow in the tree planted shelter belt

## Overview
- Two overland flow (OLF) traps installed in a 5 m x 5 m tree shelter belt.
- Observed differences in soil texture between the almost-adjacent traps.
- Monitoring period referenced: 12/04–21/04. OLF as a percentage of rainfall at RG3: Trap 1 > 15.9%, Trap 2 4.2%; bowl area recorded 19.75% for the same period.
- Ongoing maintenance and setup changes documented across multiple dates, indicating focus on data collection reliability and trap integrity.

## Monitoring setup and data context
- OLF traps are paired in the shelter belt; data are tied to rainfall measurements at RG3 and comparative bowl area data.
- Starting and ongoing maintenance includes gutter cleaning, re-inserting plastic guides, and improvements to prevent blockages.
- Tipping bucket (TB) monitoring systems installed on OLFs starting 29/08/08; calibration values noted (e.g., TB1 169.5 ml/tip; TB4 185.2 ml/tip as of 31/11/08).

## Key observations and findings
- Early comparison shows Trap 1 had higher OLF relative to rainfall than Trap 2 during 12/04–21/04, with the bowl area showing even higher flow for the same period.
- Soil texture differences between traps may influence runoff behavior, despite close proximity.

## Maintenance, adjustments, and data quality notes
- 04/04/06: Trap 2 gutter guide plastic damaged; reinserted and secured; soil sealed along the seam; one footprint (likely sheep) observed near Trap 2.
- 21/04/06; 02/08/06; 21/08/06; 27/09/06: repeated gutter/connection maintenance; replacement with stainless steel strips; one trap’s barrel connection initially missing or blocked.
- 08/03/07; 29/08/08: continued cleaning; addition of tipping bucket systems to OLFs.
- 04/09/08; 06/10/08; 10/10/08: Blockages in TBs and gutters addressed; some components removed for repair; TB1 and TB5 calibrations noted.
- 31/11/08: TB1 calibrated to TB5 and TB4 calibrated prior to installation; data tied to these calibrations.
- 02/12/08; 17/02/09: Tiny tag/logger issues (dampness suspected); replacement with a tiny tag logger; recommendation to store in plastic bags.
- 20/02/09: Leak in the downpipe of Trap 1 discovered and repaired; data quality questions for that period.
- 13/03/09; 06/04/09: Ongoing irregular runoff responses; suspected time-stamp issues related to GMT/BST changes; adjustments noted during data analysis to account for clock shifts.

## Data quality and interpretation considerations
- Time-stamp inconsistencies and GMT/BST transitions require adjustments to ensure continuity between downloads.
- Leaks, blockages, and device failures (e.g., downpipe leaks, tuber blockages) can cause atypical flow readings and buildup before release.
- Tiny tag logger failures and marginal hardware issues can affect data integrity, necessitating QA steps and corroboration with maintenance logs.
- Data interpretation should account for equipment-related biases (blockages, connection status, and calibration changes) when comparing traps or across time.

## Conclusions and implications for analysis
- The two traps show different runoff behavior, possibly due to small-scale soil texture differences, not just rainfall, highlighting the importance of site-specific factors in interpreting OLF data.
- The dataset requires careful QA/QC, particularly around 2008–2009 due to blockages, leaks, and time-stamp adjustments.
- Maintaining comprehensive maintenance logs and ensuring alignment with standardized data portals are essential for producing robust environmental monitoring outputs and enabling broader data sharing.
