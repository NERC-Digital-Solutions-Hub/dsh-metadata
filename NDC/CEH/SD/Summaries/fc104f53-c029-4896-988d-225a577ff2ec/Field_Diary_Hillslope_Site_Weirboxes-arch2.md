# This file is for the weir boxes that are measuring drain and overland flow in the bowl.

## Overview
- Purpose: Document weir boxes that measure drain (DRAIN) and overland flow (OLF) in the bowl.
- Installation: 01/11/06.
- Main content: Measurements taken, equipment status, maintenance events, data quality, and field observations from 2006–2008.

## Equipment and measurements
- DRAIN flow weir box:
  - Relative position to v-notch: ~23.33 mm above the v-notch.
  - V-notch geometry: average length 212.5 mm; coefficient of variation (CV) 2.99%.
- OLF weir box:
  - Relative position to v-notch: ~106 mm below the v-notch.
  - V-notch geometry: average length 211 mm; CV 1.3%.
- Internal surface area (approximate, used for flow calculations):
  - DRAIN: 75.2 cm × 69.2 cm (0.520384 m²)
  - OLF: 74.5 cm × 69.1 cm and 75.1 cm × 69.2 cm (AVE ≈ 0.517 m²)
- Water depth measurements (during logging):
  - Average depth in the drain flow box: 112 mm (edge away from V-notch to avoid drawdown effects).
  - Depth above the V-notch (for drain): 37.3 mm.
  - DRAIN flow reading cited as approximately 111 mm (context indicates a measured water level relative to the V-notch).

## Field observations and events (timeline highlights)
- 08/11/06: OLF weir box leaking detected during download.
- 14/11/06: OLF weir box stilling removed to locate leak.
- 22/11/06: OLF pressure transducer reinstalled.
- 23/11/06: Leak confirmed to be the OLF weir box; box removed and dried for repair.
- 29/11/06: OLF reinstalled; water level set to 0 relative to V-notch.
- 06/12/06: Apparent wiring problem with sbelt weir box; believed corrected.
- 03/01/07 and 08/03/07: Logging resumed after prior downtime.
- 29/03/07 and 03/04/07: Data download issues linked to battery changes and logger handling.
- 07/06/07: Weirboxes measured to determine internal areas.
- 30/08/07: Drain not flowing.
- 17/09/07: Weirboxes near V-notch crest height; minor blockage on OLF noted.
- 12/12/07: Sediment in OLF gutter; downpipe cleared.
- 23/01/08: Data review suggested OLF flow observed in the field seemed higher than what the OLF boxes showed; potential blockage suspected; puddle cleaned; logger appeared dry.
- 30/01/08: Downpipe blockage in OLF gutter cleared.
- 13/03/08 – 13/03/08: data gap; downloaded file did not extend beyond prior data.
- 15/08/08: Data showed a jump/dip issue after last download on 30/07/08.

## Maintenance and field corrections
- OLF weir box leak repaired; box dried and reinstalled (late 2006).
- Repaired wiring issues (sbelt/wiring) suspected to affect readings (early 2007).
- OLF guiding material extended along trench to near end; material supply limited.
- Plastic guiding material extended to improve channeling of OLF water; soil described as crumbly in areas.
- Hillslope OLF trap repaired after mole/vole disturbance; pegged roofing material to soil.
- Downpipe and gutter maintenance: cleared blockages in multiple instances (01/2008, 30/01/2008).
- General data integrity concerns addressed by rechecking connections, batteries, and logger handling.

## Data quality and interpretation notes
- Occasional data gaps and anomalies:
  - 03/03/08–13/03/08 data gap; downloaded file duplicate of prior file.
  - 23/01/08 observation suggested actual field OLF flow was higher than box readings, implying possible blockage.
  - 30/07/08 onward: data showed abrupt changes (jump/dip) after last download.
- Common issues affecting readings:
  - Leaks in OLF weir box and later verification of actual leak location.
  - Blockages in downpipes and gutters causing underestimation of flow.
  - Evaporation effects causing the water level to drop below the V-notch at times.
  - Wiring/battery issues with the logger affecting data continuity.
- Data handling steps taken:
  - Regular downloads and checks for consistency.
  - Physical inspections and cleaning of gutters, downpipes, and troughs.
  - Reinstatement of zero reference (0 mm relative to V-notch) after repairs.

## End notes
- The dataset reflects ongoing operational challenges common to field hydraulic monitoring (leaks, blockages, evaporation, and equipment reliability).
- Efforts focused on maintaining data continuity, validating sensor readings against observed flow, and minimizing loss of data due to mechanical issues.
