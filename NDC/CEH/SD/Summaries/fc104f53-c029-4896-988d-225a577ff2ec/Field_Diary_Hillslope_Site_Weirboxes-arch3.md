# This file is for the weir boxes that are measuring drain and overland flow in the bowl

## Overview
- Field log for two weir boxes measuring drain flow and overland flow (OLF) in the bowl.
- Installed on 01/11/06.
- Documented measurements, maintenance events, blockages, leaks, and data issues from 2006 through 2008.

## Measurements and Methods
- DRAIN flow weir box: about 23.33 mm above the v-notch.
- OLF weir box: about 106 mm below the v-notch.
- V-notch geometry:
  - DRAIN: average V-length ~212.5 mm (CV 2.99%).
  - OLF: average V-length ~211 mm (CV 1.3%).
- Water depth measurements:
  - Taken at the edge of the box, away from the V-notch to avoid drawdown effects.
  - Average water depth ~112 mm.
  - Using the average V-length, depth above the V-notch estimated at ~37.3 mm; associated drain flow measurement reported as ~111 mm.
- Observational notes accompany diagrams showing V-notch measurements and water status.

## Maintenance, Adjustments, and Issues
- 08/11/06: OLF weir box leaking suspected; 14/11/06: box removed to locate leak.
- 22/11/06: OLF pressure transducer reinstalled; 23/11/06: leak localized to the actual OLF weir box around the stilling-well attachment; box removed and dried for repair.
- 27/11/06: last download indicated a problem with drain flow; 29/11/06: OLF weir box reinstalled; water level set to zero before logging restart.
- 06/12/06: apparent wiring problem with s'belt weir box; hoped resolved.
- 03/01/07, 08/03/07: efforts to stabilize wiring and improve guiding plastics; extending guiding material near end of trench (replacements and extensions noted).
- 29/03/07–04/05/07: intermittent logging issues related to battery changes and material security; attempts to keep the system logging.
- 18/04/07: evaporation causing water level in OLF to drop below the V-notch.
- 30/04/07–02/05/07: hillslope OLF trap disturbed by mole/vole activity; repairs and pegging of materials to secure traps.
- 07/06/07: internal dimensions of weir boxes measured for calibration (DRAIN ~75.2 cm x 69.2 cm; OLF ~74.5 x 69.1 cm; averages around 0.517–0.520 m²).
- 30/08/07: drain not flowing.
- 17/09/07: OLF showed a small blockage damming a few mm of water near the crest height.
- 12/12/07: sediment accumulation in the OLF gutter; downpipe cleared.
- 23/01/08: data review suggested observed OLF flow seemed too low, possibly due to blockage.
- 30/01/08: down pipe issue cleared.
- 13/03/08: data gap; 13/03/08 download appeared to duplicate previous data.
- 15/08/08: data jump observed after last download on 30/07/08.

## Data Quality, Gaps, and Governance
- Recurrent data integrity challenges:
  - Leaks in OLF weir box and stilling well connections.
  - Blockages in OLF gutter and downpipe affecting readings.
  - Wiring problems and logger-related downtime affecting continuity.
  - Evaporation causing low water levels and potential misreadings.
  - Crumbling soil and ground disturbances requiring physical stabilization (trap repairs, pegging).
  - Minor misalignment of V-notch (9 mm difference in V-length) indicating non-vertical V, impacting measurement accuracy.
- Data continuity and reliability issues:
  - Multiple periods of no data or duplicated data downloads.
  - Notable data gaps: around 03/03/08–13/03/08 and 13/03/08 duplicate file; 13/03/08 issue followed by 15/08/08 jump.
- Metadata and data governance needs (aligned with monitoring-framework aims):
  - Documenting causes of data gaps, equipment faults, and maintenance actions.
  - Ensuring data quality assurance (QA) steps are applied and shared.
  - Maintaining open access to underlying data and associated metadata.
  - Clear calibration, sensor status, and maintenance records to support traceability and informed decision-making.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- The case illustrates common monitoring-frame challenges: data gaps, equipment reliability, and data verifiability.
- Highlights the need for:
  - Rigorous QA processes and standardized metadata to accompany field data.
  - Proactive maintenance schedules and robust hardware to minimize leaks, blockages, and wiring faults.
  - Transparent documentation of all anomalies, repairs, and data corrections to support governance and reproducibility.
- For policy and management use, interpretations should account for potential biases introduced by leaks, blockages, evaporation, and drift in sensor alignment.
