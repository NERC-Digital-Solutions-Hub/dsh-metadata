# Hillslope tensiometers

## Overview
- A detailed chronological log (2004–2009) of tensiometer maintenance, data collection, and equipment issues in the hillslope study area, including shelterbelt and transect sites.
- Records cover sensor deployments, degassing, vent checks, calibration/replacements, data downloads, and numerous data quality/continuity problems.
- Highlights the interplay between instrument reliability, environmental factors (burrowing animals, moisture, vegetation), and data integrity challenges for environmental monitoring.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Sensor network locations and depths vary (e.g., 10 cm and 50 cm depths; cages along hillslope and shelterbelt transects such as T2.2.10, T3.3.50, T1.3.50).
- Regular actions noted:
  - Degassing of tensiometers and vent checks (vents sometimes buried by earthworms; some vents exposed as needed).
  - Reinstalls and new-hole deployments when readings were anomalous or equipment degraded.
  - Replacements and recalibrations of tensiometers (including 10 cm and 50 cm depth sensors).
  - Delta-T (data logger) acquisitions and reconfigurations.
- Data management practices:
  - Delta-T data downloaded and monitored; occasional data loss due to download timing (auto-wrap) or logger power issues.
  - Offsets applied to tensiometer readings (initially set to -5 cm; later changed to 0 after a download).
  - Acknowledgement of broader data handling across shelterbelt and hillslope components.

## Data quality issues and incidents
- Periods of missing or suspect data:
  - 11/05–02/06 missing data in the log.
  - 01/04/07–01/05/07 data gaps due to logging/offset issues.
  - 29/03/07–01/04/07 data considered not correct after a fuse/connection issue; later corrections attempted.
  - 29/10/08 reported logger not logging for about a month; external battery failures noted (03/11/08).
  - 04/12/08 note: data offset correction from -5 cm to 0 cm cross all tensiometers; subsequent need to adjust data processing (+10 cm) to compensate earlier offset.
- Sensor and equipment problems:
  - High, negative, or out-of-range readings; some sensors deemed dodgy and replaced (e.g., 1.2.10, 2.2.10, 3.1.50, 3.2.10).
  - Wires and tubes chewed or damaged by rodents/moles; rodent attacks on wires (e.g., 22/08/07; 27/11/07).
  - External factors like mole hills forming around cages, earthworm activity burying vents, and ground disturbance from badgers.
  - Power/battery failures for loggers and Delta-T units; occasional fuse/wiring problems.
- Data integrity notes:
  - Several instances of data needing post-processing corrections (e.g., - offset changes, -5 cm offset applied historically; later statements to align data with new offset 0 cm).
  - References to spreadsheets detailing data correction steps and re-referencing tensiometer offsets after data downloads.

## Maintenance actions and corrective measures
- Maintenance and replacements:
  - Reinstalled tensiometers at various depths (notably 10 cm and 50 cm) in new holes when readings were unreliable.
  - Replaced tensiometers with recalibrated units; swapped several sensors (e.g., T2.2.10, T3.3.50, T1.3.50) due to abnormal readings or damage.
  - Degassed tensiometers across sites; cleaned gutters and removed litter/soil blockages.
  - Rewired Delta-T and logger components; replaced desiccant; addressed charger/battery issues.
- Environmental management actions:
  - Grass cutting and cage maintenance to reduce interference with sensors.
  - Removal or relocation of sensors temporarily during significant ground disturbance or when devices became unserviceable.
- Data handling adjustments:
  - Adjusted offsets to 0 cm post-download; documented the need to apply compensatory offsets later (e.g., +10 cm) to align historical data with updated offsets.

## Observations and context
- Hydrological context notes include qualitative comparisons such as “the streams are drier now” relative to historical conditions (reference to 1976 observations by Roger, with implications for site moisture regimes).
- Distinctions between shelterbelt and hillslope zones, and the impacts of fauna (moles, badgers) and vegetation (grass in cages, shelterbelt dynamics) on sensor performance and data quality.

## Data management, documentation, and implications for analysis
- The log emphasizes the need for careful data curation given frequent sensor replacements, environmental disturbances, and data corrections.
- Analysts should account for:
  - Time periods with missing or questionable data and the corresponding reliance on alternative measurements or imputation.
  - Offsets and unit changes across the dataset, ensuring harmonization before comparative analyses.
  - Sensor-specific reliability issues (e.g., repeated sensor replacements, feeding into potential biases during overlap periods).
- The record demonstrates a robust workflow for maintaining long-term environmental monitoring data but also highlights the necessity of documenting all hardware and processing changes to preserve interpretability.

## End-of-period status and takeaways for monitoring
- By 2008–2009, the network underwent multiple sensor replacements and offset recalibrations, with ongoing attention to data integrity.
- Persistent challenges from wildlife, equipment failures, and data handling required continuous maintenance and post-processing to maintain a usable dataset.
- The documentation provides rich context for understanding data gaps and corrections, enabling more reliable longitudinal analyses of hillslope moisture dynamics and shelterbelt interactions.
