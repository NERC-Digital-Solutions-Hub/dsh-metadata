# This file is for the weir boxes that are measuring drain and overland flow in the bowl

## Overview
- Purpose: Document measurements and events for two weir boxes (drain flow and overland flow) in a bowl.
- Install date: 01/11/06.
- Initial setup:
  - DRAIN weir box height above v-notch: ~23.33 mm.
  - OLF weir box height below v-notch: ~106 mm.
- Internal area measurements (to be used for flow calculations):
  - DRAIN: 75.2 cm × 69.2 cm; AVE 0.520384 m².
  - OLF: 74.5 cm × 69.1 cm and 75.1 cm × 69.2 cm; AVE 0.517242 m².

## Key measurements and observations (early months)
- 08/11/06: OLF weir box leaking detected; 14/11/06: after removing stilling, leakage investigated.
- 14–23/11/06: measurements and observations of V-notch geometry:
  - DRAIN V-notch not perfectly vertical; average V length ~212.5 mm; coefficient of variation (CV) ~3%.
  - OLF V-notch average length ~211 mm; CV ~1.3%.
- Water depth measurements taken at logger download edge (to avoid drawdown effects):
  - Average water depth: ~112 mm.
  - Using V-side geometry, estimated depth above V-notch: ~37.3 mm (for DRAIN).
  - Report mentions “DRAIN Flow 111 mm” in the same context, indicating some related depth metric per download.

## Maintenance, repairs, and configuration changes
- 22/11/06: Reinstalled OLF pressure transducer (~14:50).
- 23/11/06: Found OLF box leaking (near the hole where the stilling well attaches); box removed and dried before repair.
- 27/11/06: Last download indicated a problem with the drain flow (loose wire) fixed.
- 29/11/06: Reinstalled OLF weir box; water level set to zero relative to logger time.
- 06/12/06 and 03/01/07: Indicated wiring issues for other sensors (s'belt weir box) and resumption of logging.
- 08/03/07 to 18/04/07: Additional adjustments to OLF gutter guiding material; soil conditions noted (crumbly soil).
- 30/04/07–02/05/07: Evaporation effects (water level dropping below V-notch) and OLF trap disturbance due to mole/vole activity; repairs attempted.
- 07/06/07: Weirboxs measured again to determine updated internal areas (DRAIN ~0.520 m²; OLF ~0.517 m²).
- 30/08/07: Drain not flowing.
- 17/09/07: Generally the boxes were at V-notch crest height; minor blockage on OLF observed.
- 12/12/07: Noted substantial sediment in OLF gutter; downpipe cleared.
- 23/01/08: Download review: OLF data appeared too low relative to first-hand field observations; suspected blockage; minor cleanup of puddle in cabinet; logger appeared dry after retrieval.
- 30/01/08: Down pipe of OLF gutter cleared.
- 13/03/08: Gap in data from 03/03/08 to 13/03/08; the 13/03/08 file appeared to replicate prior data.
- 15/08/08: Data jump noted after last download on 30/07/08.

## Data quality and issues
- Recurring blockages and sediment affecting OLF path (sediment build-up, down pipe blockages, OLF gutter blockages).
- Evaporation causing water levels to drop below the V-notch at times.
- Leaks and wiring issues affecting sensor reliability (OLF leak, s'belt weir wiring).
- Gaps in data due to logging interruptions, battery issues, or download problems.
- Variability in V-notch geometry (non-vertical V, occasional crest-height concerns) impacting depth-to-flow calculations.
- Some data anomalies: apparent data duplication or mismatch between field observations and logged data (early 2008).

## Notable timing and issues by date (highlights)
- 01/11/06: Install.
- 08/11/06–14/11/06: OLF leak identified and mitigated.
- 22/11/06–29/11/06: Transducer and weir box reinstallation; zeroing reference established.
- 06/12/06–03/01/07: Wiring/maintenance checks; logging resumes.
- 08/03/07–18/04/07: Physical adjustments to guiding material; soil stability concerns.
- 29/03/07–03/04/07: Logger download and battery issues; data gaps possible.
- 12/12/07–23/01/08: Sediment issues and data review; blockage suspected for OLF.
- 30/01/08–15/08/08: Blockages cleared; data consistency questions persist; data discrepancy noted in August 2008.
