# Overland flow in the tree planted shelter belt

- Setup and context
  - Two overland flow traps installed in a 5 m x 5 m tree planted shelter belt.
  - Observation noted that traps, despite proximity, showed differences in soil texture.
  - Monitoring period includes April 2006 with OLF as a percentage of rainfall measured at RG3; comparative data also referenced for bowl area.

- Key observations and measurements
  - 12/04 – 21/04: Overland flow as % of rainfall — Trap 1 ~15.9%, Trap 2 ~4.2%; bowl area ~19.75% for the same period.
  - 04/04/06: Trap 2 gutter guide plastic detached; repaired by cutting into soil and securing with nails; noted a sheep footprint.
  - Ongoing maintenance notes (partial list): gutters cleaned of leaf litter; reinserted edging; upscaling to prevent leakage; covers placed to reduce direct rain input into gutters.

- Maintenance, equipment, and data integrity actions
  - 21/04/06; 02/08/06; 21/08/06: gutters and litter cleaned; downpipes/gutters checked; pipe disconnections addressed (e.g., 21/08/06 T2 pipe disconnected).
  - 27/09/06: gutter guides replaced with stainless steel strips; one trap (Trap 1) initially not connected to barrel; corrected later; Trap 2 barrel nearly full but drain hole clogged.
  - 08/03/07: gutters cleared; 29/08/08: tipping bucket (TB) monitoring systems installed for both OLF traps.
  - 04/09/08: Trap 1 blockage detected and unblocked around 1200 GMT; measures implemented to mitigate blockage; further checks planned.
  - 06/10/08: TB1 blocked; bottom collection gutter had come away; repaired and reinstalled TB components.
  - 10/10/08: TB1 reinstalled; 31/11/08: Trap 1 TB5 calibrated to 169.5 ml/tip; Trap 2 TB4 calibrated to 185.2 ml/tip; noted time stamp issues between downloads and adjusted data accordingly.
  - 02/12/08: Trap 1 tiny tag logger failed due to dampness; replaced with a new tag logger; suggestion to bag sensors for protection.
  - 17/02/09 – 20/02/09: leak detected in the down pipe of Trap 1; repaired; data quality questioned for the last monitoring period.
  - 13/03/09: Trap 1 continued to show odd runoff responses; causes not clearly determinable.
  - 06/04/09: time stamp issues likely due to GMT to BST changes; adjustments accounted for in analysis.

- Data quality and interpretation considerations
  - Occasional blockages, leaks, and sensor faults affecting measurements.
  - Calibration of tipping buckets essential for converting tips to milliliters per tip.
  - Time stamps and synchronization issues across multiple devices and data downloads.
  - Observed differences between traps and potential influence of differing soil textures within close proximity.

- GIS-relevant implications
  - Require integrating OLF measurements with rainfall data (RG3) and bowl-area comparisons for spatial analysis.
  - Maintenance logs are crucial to explain data anomalies and sensor downtime in spatial datasets.
  - Highlight micro-scale soil variability within the shelter belt that can affect hydrological measurements.
