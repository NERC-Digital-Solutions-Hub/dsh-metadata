# Hillslope tensiometers

## Summary at a glance
- A detailed operational and data integrity log for hillslope tensiometers spanning 2004–2009, covering maintenance, re-installations, degassing, calibration, data gaps, and multiple data correction steps.
- Documents extensive field challenges (biological interference, weathering, power/logger failures) and their impact on data continuity and quality.
- Notes post-collection data treatments to align measurements (offset corrections, re-baselining) and references to data provenance and spreadsheets.

## What was measured and how
- Instruments: tensiometers deployed at multiple transects (e.g., T2.2.10, T3.3.50, T3.1.50, etc.) at various depths (commonly 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm; sometimes 13 cm).
- Locations: hillslope and shelter belt areas; some measurements associated with a “bowl” or specific transects.
- Data types: water potential readings from tensiometers; accompanying Delta-T data downloads referenced.
- Activities include: installation/reinstallation, degassing, vent checks, grass cutting, dry-out management, and periodic recalibration or replacement of tensiometers.

## Data quality issues and notable events
- Data gaps and missing periods:
  - Missing data from 11/05–02/06.
  - No data for periods such as 01/04/07–01/05/07 due to logger rewiring and timing issues.
  - Other periods noted as “no data” or “data dodgy” (e.g., 29/03/07–01/04/07; later gaps around 2007–2008).
- Logger and hardware failures:
  - Hillslope logging stopped (discovered 20/03/06; ongoing issues through 2006).
  - Logger box failures and battery issues causing intermittent logging (e.g., 31/10/07, 06/11/07; 29/10/08 external battery failure; 02/12/08 not logging for a month).
  - Fuse and relay problems, mis-wired or mis-timed data channels, and occasional data that appeared incorrect or out of range.
  - External factors: vandalism/rodent damage to wires, mole hills around cages, buried vents due to earthworms.
- Data reliability concerns:
  - Early data included negative/offset interpretation issues due to wiring and program settings.
  - Several instances of “data not correct” or “data jumped around” prompting replacements or reinstallation.
  - Some readings were affected by degassing events, vent status, or miscalibrated channels.
- Recalibration and replacements:
  - Numerous tensiometers replaced or reinstalled (e.g., 02/09/08, 16/10/08; 25/07/08; 04/12/08).
  - Use of recalibrated tensiometers in the tree shelterbelt area; changes in installation angles (15°) and in-hole replacement strategies.
  - Specific tensiometers reinstalled due to abnormal readings (e.g., T1.3.50, T2.1.30, 3.1.50) and some reinserted in the same holes as prior ones.
- Data corrections and normalization:
  - 01/04/07–01/05/07: after discovering a wiring change that inverted the sign, a post-collection correction was planned; offset originally at -5 cm required subsequent +10 cm adjustment to counterbalance.
  - 04/12/08: a correction established to set all offsets to 0 after download; consistency across datasets needed.
  - Spreadsheets referenced for details on these corrections and their application to the data.

## Deployment and maintenance details
- Depths and placements frequently adjusted in response to ground conditions (e.g., dry areas, mole activity, tree belt effects).
- Orientation adjustments: some tensiometers installed at a 15° angle relative to the ground in certain areas; offset changes applied differently outside the tree area versus inside.
- Regular field tasks included degassing, vent cleaning, grass cutting, and litter/soil clearing to improve measurement conditions.
- Data handling notes:
  - Downloading Delta-T data and general data logging procedures documented.
  - Where data integrity was in doubt, components were replaced, clocks/reset counters re-synced, and attempts made to re-download data to recover measurements.

## Implications for analysis and data use
- The dataset comprises extensive maintenance histories, which are essential for interpreting gaps, offsets, and potential biases.
- Analysts should account for:
  - Temporal data gaps and periods of questionable reliability.
  - Sign-inversions and offset corrections applied post-collection; explicit provenance needed for each corrected segment.
  - Variability introduced by environmental and biological interferences (rodents, mole activity, earthworms) and by equipment issues (battery, logger, wiring).
  - Reinstallation and recalibration events that may correspond to step changes in readings independent of actual soil–water status.
- Metadata and data provenance (as referenced by logs and spreadsheets) are critical for ensuring that downstream analyses properly align with the documented corrections and maintenance history.

## Endnotes and ongoing considerations
- The log extends through frequent updates in 2008–2009, with multiple corrective actions and periodic hardware replacements continuing to manage data quality.
- Future analyses should integrate the full maintenance chronology to properly interpret temporal changes and ensure consistent calibration across the monitoring period.
