# Hillslope tensiometers

## Overview
- A longitudinal, event-driven maintenance and data-logging diary for hillslope and shelterbelt tensiometers from 2004 to 2009.
- Records routine actions (degassing, grass cutting, vent checks, recalibration), equipment replacements, data gaps, and incidents affecting data integrity.
- Highlights the challenges of field data: sensor degradation, animal interference, weather/soil conditions, and logging hardware faults.

## Data Management and Provenance
- Sensors and locations:
  - Multiple tensiometers at various depths (e.g., 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) across hillslope and shelterbelt transects (e.g., T2.2.10, T3.3.50, 1.2.10).
- Logging system and data handling:
  - Delta-T/logger system with periodic downloads; issues included missed download times, auto-wrap data loss, and external battery/power failures.
  - Post-collection data corrections later applied to address offset issues and data interpretation.
- Metadata and event tracking:
  - Detailed notes on degassing, re-installations, tube replacements, and calibration changes.
  - Serial numbers, holes, and positions tracked; observations about vents buried or damaged by soil organisms.
- Data gaps and outages:
  - Notable gaps include missing data from 11/05 to 02/06; periods when logging stopped (e.g., 29/03/07 to 01/05/07; late 2008 issues).
  - Occasional data anomalies acknowledged (e.g., periods of abnormal readings, suspected logger faults).

## Equipment and Operational Challenges
- Environmental and biological interference:
  - Mole and rodent activity damaging tubes, vents, and cables; badger and earthworm impacts noted.
  - Ground disturbances and burial of vents leading to reading anomalies.
- Technical faults and maintenance responses:
  - Fuses, battery failures, logger box failures, and miswired connections causing data loss.
  - Replacements and recalibrations of tensiometers; new holes dug and instruments reinstalled.
  - Regular degassing and cleaning to maintain sensor performance.
- Data integrity incidents:
  - Instances of clearly incorrect data (e.g., 29/03/07–01/04/07) requiring later correction.

## Data Quality and Analysis Impact
- Reading reliability issues:
  - Periods of negative or inconsistent readings prompting recalibration or replacement.
  - Noted instances where data were not right due to logger or hardware problems.
- Post-collection adjustments:
  - Offset adjustments applied (initially -5 cm offset changed to 0); consideration (and note) that a subsequent +10 cm adjustment may be required to compensate previous processing.
  - Some corrections documented as post-collection processing; detailed spreadsheet references noted.
- Contextual observations:
  - Field observations (e.g., streams drier than in the past; pond water management) provide environmental context but are secondary to data integrity concerns.

## Lessons and Recommendations for Data Leaders
- Strengthen data provenance:
  - Maintain thorough metadata for every maintenance action, fault, and correction; ensure versioning of data corrections.
- Improve data resilience and governance:
  - Implement hardware redundancy, robust power supplies, and proactive monitoring to minimize data gaps.
  - Develop standardized protocols for degassing, vent maintenance, and sensor replacement to reduce user-dependent variability.
- Enhance data quality control:
  - Establish automated checks to flag abnormal readings early and document remediation steps.
  - Create a formal process for post-collection data corrections with clear justification and traceability.
- Address environmental risks:
  - Assess protective measures against wildlife damage; consider site redesign or shielding for vulnerable components.
- Promote knowledge sharing:
  - Share learnings with the wider data community to support better practice in field data collection and processing. 

## Conclusion
- The document is a comprehensive operational diary of hillslope tensiometer deployment, maintenance, and data integrity challenges, underscoring the need for robust data governance, meticulous metadata, and proactive maintenance to ensure reliable, traceable data over long-term field studies.
