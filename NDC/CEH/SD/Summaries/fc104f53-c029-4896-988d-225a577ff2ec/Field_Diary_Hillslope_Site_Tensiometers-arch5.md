# Hillslope tensiometers

- Overview
  - A long-term field log documenting tensiometer measurements on the hillslope study area, including the shelterbelt and surrounding cages, from 2004 to 2009.
  - Records frequent maintenance and operational events: degassing, recalibration, reinstallation, replacements, and attention to data logger hardware and power.

- Data coverage and structure
  - Multiple tensiometers positioned at various depths (e.g., 10 cm, 50 cm) and transect points (e.g., 1.1.50, 2.2.10, 3.3.50) across the shelterbelt and hillslope.
  - Data collection often interrupted by technical issues (degassing, vent obstructions, sensor replacements, power/battery failures) and environmental factors (rodent and mole activity).
  - Notable periods of missing or unreliable data:
    - Missing data from 11/05 to 02/06.
    - Data quality concerns around 29/03/07 to 01/04/07 and 01/04/07 to 01/05/07 due to faults (fuse, logger wiring) and subsequent partial recovery.
    - Additional gaps due to logger downtime, battery failures, and external interference (e.g., chewed wires, underground issues).

- Data quality, integrity, and corrections
  - Regular degassing and vent checks; numerous re-installs and sensor replacements to address drifting or abnormal readings.
  - Periodic data integrity issues identified (e.g., high readings, negative/positive offset concerns) requiring recalibration and hardware fixes.
  - Post-collection data processing adjustments to offsets:
    - Initial offset changes noted (from -5 cm to 0, then to 0 with later notes to apply +5 cm or +10 cm corrections as needed).
    - A specific correction documented: after 01/04/07 to 01/05/07, a -5 cm offset was reversed and a +5 cm offset applied; subsequent processing indicated a need for an additional +10 cm adjustment to counter earlier offset handling. A 0-offset period was established after certain downloads, with later corrections applied to align the entire dataset.

- Maintenance and operational actions
  - Reinstallations and replacements of tensiometers at key transects and depths (e.g., 10 cm and 50 cm positions) to recover data continuity.
  - Regular degassing, cleaning of gutters, vent checks, grass cutting around cages, and addressing environmental obstructions (molehills, badger disturbances).
  - Technical interventions on the data logger and Delta-T devices (downloading, battery changes, fuse/relay fixes, wiring corrections, and power supply checks).
  - Documentation of anomalies and corrective actions to preserve data provenance.

- Context and environmental notes
  - Qualitative observation: streams and pools on the site have become drier over time compared with records from 1976, with cattle-pasture management implications (e.g., watering from ponds).

- Implications for data governance and stewardship
  - The dataset requires detailed provenance: records of sensor deployments, replacements, calibrations, offsets, and data processing adjustments.
  - Clear metadata on data gaps, failures, and corrective actions is essential to enable reliable secondary analysis.
  - Ongoing data quality assurance is necessary to distinguish natural hydrological signals from instrumentation artifacts, given recurring hardware and environmental interference.
