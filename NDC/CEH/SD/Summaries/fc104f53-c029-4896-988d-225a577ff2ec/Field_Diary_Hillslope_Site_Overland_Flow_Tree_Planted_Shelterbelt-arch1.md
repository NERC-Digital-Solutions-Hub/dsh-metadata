# Overland flow in the tree planted shelter belt

## Summary
- Two overland flow traps installed in a 5 m x 5 m tree planted shelter belt. Despite proximity, soil texture differences observed between traps.
- During 12/04–21/04 monitoring, overland flow as a percentage of rainfall measured at RG3 was:
  - Trap 1: > 15.9%
  - Trap 2: 4.2%
  - Bowl area: 19.75% for the same period
- The log documents ongoing maintenance and data-collection updates, including equipment adjustments, gutter/pipe repairs, and calibration efforts over years.

## Measurements and comparisons
- Observed differences in measured overland flow between adjacent traps suggest potential local soil or setup effects.
- Noted baseline comparison for the same period shows a higher outflow in the bowl area (19.75%) than Trap 1 and Trap 2, with Trap 1 contributing a larger share (>15.9%) than Trap 2 (4.2%).

## Equipment and maintenance activities
- 04/04/06: Trap 2 gutter guide plastic detached; repaired by inserting into soil slit and nailing; soil tamped to cover seam. A sheep footprint noted in the area.
- 12/04–21/04/06: Regular maintenance entries include cleaning gutters of leaf litter, re-installing edging, and clearing behind edging.
- 21/08/06: Pipe connection issues; upslope bucket readings noted; grounds uneven.
- 27/09/06: Gutter guide plastic replaced with stainless steel strips on OLF 1 and OLF 2.
- 04/09/08 onward: Installation of tipping bucket (TB) monitoring systems for OLF; subsequent entries document blockages and repairs (e.g., TB1 blockage fixed around 1200 GMT; TB components recalibrated).
- 02/12/08: Tiny tag logger experienced a failure; replacement recommended; suggestion to enclose in plastic bags.
- 17/02/09: Leak detected in the down pipe of Trap 1; repaired and reinstalled by 20/02/09; data quality questioned for affected period.
- 13/03/09–06/04/09: Ongoing issues with odd runoff responses and time-stamp anomalies; DST (GMT/BST) changes acknowledged and corrected in analysis.

## Data quality and issues
- Time-stamp issues and overlaps between downloads noted; adjustments made in analysis to align events with actual times.
- Leaks (e.g., down pipe for Trap 1) and blockages (gullets/pipes) reported; such problems raise questions about data reliability during affected periods.
- Sensor reliability concerns (tiny tag loggers) led to replacements; packaging suggestions (e.g., plastic bags) proposed to protect sensors.
- DST transitions (GMT/BST) introduced potential timing discrepancies, subsequently accounted for in data analysis.

## Observations and implications
- The proximity of traps with differing soil textures implies local heterogeneity can affect infiltration/outflow measurements and data interpretation.
- Recurrent maintenance and equipment failures (blockages, disconnections, leaks) can bias short-term flow readings; robust checks post-rain are essential.
- Calibrations of tipping bucket systems and careful time alignment are critical for accurate longitudinal analysis.

## Conclusions and recommendations
- The experimental setup should be checked after rainfall events to ensure integrity of gutters, pipes, and connections.
- Address recurring data-quality risks: fix leaks promptly, prevent blockages, and ensure timely calibration of TBs.
- Standardize time-stamping practices across data downloads to minimize DST-related discrepancies.
- Consider documenting soil-texture effects more comprehensively to understand inter-trap variability in overland flow.
