# Temperature at Depth Data (1–19 m)

## Overview
- Field dataset recording temperature at depths from 1 m to 19 m at a single site.
- Uses 10 Labfacility platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) in a stainless steel sheath.
- Data collected from 03/11/2006 00:00 to 15/12/2008 14:00.
- Data logger: Campbell Scientific CR10X.

## Data structure
- Field level headings correspond to depths: 1m, 3m, 5m, 7m, 9m, 11m, 13m, 15m, 17m, 19m.
- Each column records temperature in °C at the specified depth.
- Thermometer range: -5 to +40 °C.

## Spatial and temporal context
- Location: grid reference SH 77961 46465; latitude 53.001555; longitude -3.8200267; elevation 460 m.
- Date range spans over two years within 2006–2008.

## Equipment and data collection
- Temperature string: 10 x Labfacility PRTs encapsulated in a stainless steel sheath.
- Data logging medium: Campbell Scientific CR10X.

## Data management and quality
- As an environment monitoring dataset, it would follow standard QA/verification, cleaning, and transformation processes.
- Outputs typically presented as reports, maps, and charts.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Uses and insights
- Enables construction of depth-temperature profiles for environmental health monitoring and policy performance analyses.
- Supports time-series and spatial comparisons when integrated with other datasets.

## Challenges and considerations
- Increasing the value of the dataset by combining with other relevant data sources (avoiding single-use).
- Ensuring accessibility to the underlying data used to generate final outputs.
