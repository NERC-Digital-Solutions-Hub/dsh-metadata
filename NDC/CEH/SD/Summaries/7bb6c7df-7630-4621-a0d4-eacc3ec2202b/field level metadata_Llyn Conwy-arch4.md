# Temperature data from field depths (1m to 19m) using Labfacility PRTs, 2006-2008

- Overview
  - 10 Labfacility platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) encapsulated in stainless steel, read by a Campbell Scientific CR10X data logger
  - Measurements at depths: 1m, 3m, 5m, 7m, 9m, 11m, 13m, 15m, 17m, 19m (GMT timestamps)
  - Temperature readings are in degrees Celsius

- Data scope and collection
  - Date range: 03/11/2006 00:00 to 15/12/2008 14:00
  - Location: grid ref SH 77961 46465; latitude 53.001555; longitude -3.8200267; elevation 460m

- Data attributes and structure
  - Depth-specific temperature fields corresponding to each depth (1m, 3m, 5m, 7m, 9m, 11m, 13m, 15m, 17m, 19m)
  - Temperature range for thermometers: -5 to +40 °C
  - Temperature string indicates 10 sensors (Labfacility PRTs) and stainless steel encapsulation
  - Data logger: Campbell Scientific CR10X

- Data quality, metadata, and governance
  - Single-site deployment; time-limited window (2006-2008)
  - Requires calibration records for traceable accuracy; ensure metadata completeness for discoverability
  - Consistent unit usage (°C) and clear depth labeling facilitate cross-site integration

- Access, reuse, and stewardship considerations
  - No explicit access barriers noted; metadata should support discoverability and reuse
  - Data suitable for temperature profiling across depths, soil/groundwater studies, and climate-related analyses
  - Plan for long-term preservation, versioning, and documentation of data lineage

- Implications and recommendations for Data Leaders
  - Assess need for integrating this dataset with other sites to address granularity and coverage gaps
  - Standardize metadata (depth labels, timestamp formats, sensor calibration info) to improve interoperability
  - Maintain calibration and maintenance records; verify data quality before cross-network use
