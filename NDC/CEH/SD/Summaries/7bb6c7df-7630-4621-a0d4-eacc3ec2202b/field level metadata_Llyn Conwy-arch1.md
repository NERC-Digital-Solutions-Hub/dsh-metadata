# Temperature at multiple depths dataset (1–19 m)

## Overview
- Temperature measurements at multiple depths: 1 m, 3 m, 5 m, 7 m, 9 m, 11 m, 13 m, 15 m, 17 m, 19 m.
- Each depth has temperature readings in degrees Celsius (°C) synchronized to GMT.

## Timeframe and Location
- Date range: 03/11/2006 00:00 to 15/12/2008 14:00.
- Location: Grid reference SH 77961 46465; Latitude 53.001555°; Longitude -3.8200267°; Elevation 460 m.

## Instrumentation
- Temperature sensors: 10 Labfacility platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) in stainless steel sheaths.
- Data logger: Campbell Scientific CR10X.

## Data structure and units
- Temperature range: -5 to +40 °C.
- Field headers indicate temperature at each depth in GMT (e.g., "1m, GMT = °C at 1 metre," etc.).

## Data quality and notes
- Calibration details, measurement uncertainty, and sampling interval are not specified.
- Metadata includes precise depth-specific fields, sensor type, and location, aiding reproducibility and mapping.

## Potential Analytic Uses
- Construct vertical temperature profiles over time to study stratification and thermal dynamics.
- Examine temporal trends and seasonal patterns across depths.
- Compare temperature signals against geographic metadata for spatial analysis within the site.
