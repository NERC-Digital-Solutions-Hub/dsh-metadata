# WP1A Dewaterability potential of anaerobic digestate and biomass ash blends using polymer dose approach

- Objective: Assess dewaterability of blends of anaerobic digestate and biomass ash using a polymer-dosed approach, and examine how nutrient partitioning between liquor and fibre fractions occurs after dewatering. This informs environmental monitoring and policy-relevant evaluation of digestate management and nutrient recovery potential.

## Data files and content

- WP1A1.csv: Polymer dose test results used to identify optimum polymer type and dose for each digestate/ash mix.
- WP1A2.csv: Dewaterability outcomes and nutrient fractions for blends (fibre and liquor) at the optimum polymer dose; includes analyses of nutrient concentrations in both fractions.

## Samples and materials

- Anaerobic digestates (D1 and D2)
  - D1: Source segregated household food waste (mainly household)
  - D2: Maize silage, vegetables waste, sweet-corn waste, aerobically treated food waste, and other biodegradable sludge
  - Samples sourced from different UK industrial-scale AD plants during the project
  - Sample handling: 5–10 kg per sample, stored cold (<4°C) and analyzed promptly
- Biomass ashes
  - A1: Fly ash (light fraction) from virgin wood bark and chipped timber (85%)
  - A2: Bottom ash (heavy fraction) from Sitka spruce and 15% Larch
  - Samples typically 10–20 kg, air-dried, milled to pass 1 mm, stored at room temperature until use

## Experimental design

- Stage 1: Preliminary polymer dose tests (WP1A1)
  - Objective: Identify optimum polymer type and dose for each digestate/ash mix
  - Polymer solutions: 0.5% concentration
  - Test conditions: Four dosing rates corresponding to 0, 5, 10, 20 g polymer per kg dry solids (DS)
  - Procedure: Jar-testing with 1 L vessels, mix for 2 min at 100 rpm, then 15 min at 30 rpm; centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 15 min to separate liquor and fibre; filter and dry solids to determine Total Suspended Solids (TSS) in liquor
  - Output: Optimum polymer type and dose per mix (documented in WP1A1.csv)

- Stage 2: Blends dewaterability and nutrient fractionation (WP1A2)
  - Blends tested: D1, D1A1, D1A2, D2, D2A1, D2A2
  - Dewatering: Using optimum polymer type and dose from Stage 1
  - Replication: Each blend tested in triplicate (36 samples total across 6 blend types)
  - Centrifugation: 3000 rpm for 10 min to obtain fibre and liquor
  - Measurements: Nutrient and major element composition of liquor and fibre

## Polymers and dosing details

- Polymers used (as per Table 3 in the metadata)
  - DW2145 (cationic, cross-linked)
  - FO4498SSH (cationic, branched)
  - FAM4028 (cationic/anionic, branched)
- Dosing basis (Table 4 guidance)
  - Dosing rates vary by blend, typically 40–50 mg polymer per kg DS
  - Specific polymer-dose mapping is tied to each blend (D1, D1A1, D1A2, D2, D2A1, D2A2)

## Analytical methods and key measurements

- Dewaterability indicators
  - Total Suspended Solids (TSS) in liquor fraction (from WP1A1)
  - Liquor and fibre fractions produced (volume and mass)
- Nutrient and elemental analyses (in both liquor and fibre where applicable)
  - Elements/compounds: Ca, Mg, P, K, S, Total Nitrogen (TKN), Total Organic Nitrogen (if applicable), Nitrate-N (NO3-N), Ammonium-N (NH4-N), Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, Cl, Na, others as listed
  - Nitrogen forms: TKN, N-NO3, N-NH4
  - Total phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B)
  - Units and methods: mg/kg or %, dry basis; analysis by ICP-OES (for metals) and other standard methods (e.g., APHA/APHA-derived methods); ALS Global Ltd methods referenced (30–69) and APHA (1999) standard methods referenced
- Data notes
  - Results expressed on a dry basis unless otherwise specified
  - Some values flagged as below detection limit (DL<) or not measured (N/A) for replicates

## Data provenance and quality

- Collaborative study conducted by multiple institutions (e.g., Aqua Enviro, Lancaster University, Stopford)
- Use of approved standard methods and accredited external labs for chemical analyses
- Documented metadata includes sample descriptions, blend definitions, polymer types, dosing, fractions produced, and measurement methods

## How this data supports environmental monitoring and policy analysis

- Enables assessment of how ash co-processing with digestate can improve dewaterability, thereby informing waste management and nutrient recycling strategies
- Provides quantitative measures of how nutrient partitioning between liquor and fibre changes with different blends and polymer doses, contributing to lifecycle and environmental footprint assessments
- Supplies standardized, reproducible datasets (WP1A1 and WP1A2) suitable for time-series monitoring, cross-site comparisons, and integration with other environmental data portals
- Addresses monitoring challenges by enabling data reuse and interoperability, and by documenting the underlying data generation processes for transparency and scrutiny

## Access, reuse, and context

- Datasets: WP1A1.csv and WP1A2.csv
- Documented methodology, blend definitions, polymer types, dosing schemes, and measurement protocols
- References include APHA standards and methods provided by ALS Global Ltd; explicit author contact information is included in the metadata for data provenance and potential follow-up
- These data support broader environmental health monitoring by enabling assessment of digestate management practices, dewatering performance, and nutrient recovery potential across agricultural and waste management settings
