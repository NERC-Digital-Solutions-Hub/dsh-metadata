# Determination of Suspended Particulate Matter in Water Samples

## Overview
- Method measures suspended particulate matter (SPM) in water by gravimetric filtration using glass fibre filters.
- Determines total SPM concentration (mg/L) and, if needed, separates organic and inorganic fractions via ashing at 500 °C.
- Requires blank corrections and field duplicates to assess precision; results can be converted to mg/m³.

## Equipment and consumables
- Drying oven
- Muffle furnace
- Filtering manifold for 47 mm glass fibre filters
- Vacuum pump
- Forceps
- Balance (0.01 mg, 5 decimal places)
- Wash bottle
- Aluminum trays (pre-cleaned)
- Desiccator
- Measuring cylinders (1 and 2 L)
- Sample bottles (1–5 L)
- 47 mm GF/F filters (0.8 µm)
- Distilled water
- Plastic sample bags

## Filter preparation
- Harden filters by ignition at 500 °C.
- Soak filters in distilled water (~5 minutes) to remove soluble material.
- Handle all filters with forceps; place on clean trays/foil.
- Dry filters ~1 h at 75 °C, then store in a desiccator.
- Weigh each filter and aluminum dish to the nearest 0.01 mg (W1).
- Keep dried filters desiccated and store weighed filters in a freezer-ready setup.

## Filtration procedure
- Collect water samples in bottles; filter as soon as possible; store at <4 °C if needed.
- Place weighed filter on filter base; ensure sample is well mixed.
- Determine volume to filter until filter begins to clog (target ~2 mg particulate; ~2–5 L open ocean, ~0.5–1 L coastal waters).
- Rinse solids from measuring cylinder (3 × 10 mL) through filter; rinse filter and manifold with 3× distilled water (≤50 mL each).
- Wash filter margins to remove salt; disconnect vacuum between rinses.
- Remove filter and store in its tray and bag; freeze until drying.

## Determination of blanks
- Use at least three blank filters (not used for samples) to account for hygroscopic water changes.
- Weigh blanks after redrying (W2); compute X = mean(W2) − mean(W1).
- X can be positive or negative but should not exceed 0.5 mg.

## Field duplicates
- Collect two separate samples under identical conditions at the same time to assess precision from collection, preservation, storage, and analysis.

## Filter drying and SPM calculation
- Dry filters in trays for 1 h at 75 °C, then cool in a desiccator.
- Weigh to the nearest 0.01 mg (W2 = filter + particulate matter).
- SPM concentration (mg/L): CS P M = (W2 − W1 + X) / V, where V is the volume filtered (in L). To convert to mg/m³, multiply by 1000.
- If determining organic vs inorganic fractions:
  - Ignite filters at 500 °C for 3 h to burn off organics; cool and weigh as soon as possible (W3 = filter + inorganic fraction).
  - Inorganic concentration: CI = (W3 − W1) / V.
  - Organic concentration: CO = (W2 − W3) / V.
- Unit conversions:
  - W1, W2, W3 in mg; V in L.
  - To convert weights from g to mg, multiply by 1000; to convert volume from mL to L, divide V by 1000.
