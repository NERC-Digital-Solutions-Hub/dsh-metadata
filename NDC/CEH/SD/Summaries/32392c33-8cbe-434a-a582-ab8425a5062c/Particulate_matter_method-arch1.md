# Determination of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in water using glass fibre filters

## Objective
- Quantify the concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in water and, if needed, separate into organic and inorganic fractions by filtration, drying, ignition, and weighing.

## Equipment and consumables
- Drying oven, muffle furnace, 47 mm glass fibre filters (GF/F, ~0.8 µm)
- Filtering manifold, vacuum pump, forceps, balance (0.01 mg, 5 d.p.)
- Wash bottle, aluminum trays, desiccator, measuring cylinders (1–2 L)
- Sample bottles (1–5 L), plastic bags, distilled water

## Filter preparation
- Harden filters by ignition at 500 °C.
- Soak filters in distilled water (~5 min) to remove soluble material; handle with forceps.
- Dry filters ~1 h at 75 °C; cool in a desiccator.
- Weigh each filter with aluminum dish to nearest 0.01 mg (W1); store in a desiccator until use.
- Weigh a batch of filters to monitor weight stability; keep blanks (unexposed) for correction.

## Filtration procedure
- Collect water samples in appropriate bottles; filter ASAP or store at <4 °C to minimize decomposition.
- Place weighed filter on filter manifold base; distribute sample so that filtration yields ~2 mg of particulate matter with filtration time <15 min.
- Rinse solids from measuring cylinder into the filter; rinse filter and manifold with distilled water (three 10 mL rinses, then three shorter rinses, total ≤ ~50 mL per rinse).
- Remove salt crystals from filter margins; disconnect vacuum; remove filter and return to aluminum tray; freeze until ready to dry.

## Determination of blanks
- Use at least three blank filters per batch to assess air-water moisture effects; redry and reweigh to obtain W2.
- Blank correction X = mean(W2) − mean(W1). X can be positive or negative but should be within ±0.5 mg.

## Field duplicates
- Collect two separate samples at the same time under identical conditions to assess sampling, preservation, and laboratory precision.

## Filter drying and SPM calculation
- Dry filters in aluminum trays for 1 h at 75 °C; cool in desiccator.
- Weigh filter+particulate matter to the nearest 0.01 mg (W2).
- SPM concentration (mg/L): CsPM = (W2 − W1 + X) / V, where V is the filtered water volume in litres. Report in mg/L; convert to mg/m³ by multiplying by 1000 if needed.
- To determine organic vs inorganic fractions:
  - Ignite filters at 500 °C for 3 h to burn off organic material; cool and weigh (W3) the filter plus inorganic residue.
  - Inorganic concentration: CI = (W3 − W1) / V.
  - Organic concentration: CO = (W2 − W3) / V.
- Weight units: W1, W2, W3 in mg; V in L. Convert weights from g to mg by ×1000 when needed; ensure final concentrations are in mg/L (or mg/m³ after conversion).
