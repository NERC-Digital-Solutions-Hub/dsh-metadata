# Determination of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in Seawater

## Overview
- Purpose: Measure suspended particulate matter (SPM) in water samples and, if needed, partition into organic and inorganic fractions by ignition at 500°C.
- Outputs: SPM concentration in mg/L (convertible to mg/m3 by multiplying by 1000) and, if determined, inorganic (CI) and organic (CO) fractions in mg/L.
- Key concept: Filtering volume defines detection limits; aim for ~2 mg of particulate material per filter with standard filtration times under 15 minutes. Open ocean typical volume 2–5 L; coastal waters 0.5–1 L.

## Equipment and consumables
- Drying oven, muffle furnace, 47 mm GF/F filters, filtering manifold, vacuum pump
- Forceps, balance (0.01 mg, 5 decimals), wash bottle, aluminum trays, desiccator
- Measuring cylinders (1 and 2 L), sample bottles (1–5 L), 47 mm GF/F filters
- Distilled water, plastic sample bags

## Filter preparation
- Harden filters by ignition at 500°C.
- Soak filters in distilled water ~5 minutes; handle only with forceps.
- Shake off excess water, place on clean trays/foil.
- Dry 1 hour at 75°C, then store in a desiccator.
- Weigh each filter with the aluminum dish to the nearest 0.01 mg (W1) and keep in a desiccator free from humidity until filtration.
- Batch-prepared filters are stored in Ziploc bags until use.

## Filtration procedure
- Collect water samples in suitable bottles; if storing, keep at <4°C.
- Place weighed filter on the base of the filter manifold.
- Invert sample bottle to mix thoroughly.
- Add sample to the filter until sufficient filtration occurs (target ~2 mg particulate; filtration time <15 min; total volume V depends on environment: open ocean 2–5 L; coastal 0.5–1 L).
- Rinse solids from measurement cylinder with three 10 mL rinses of distilled water; pass through the filter.
- Rinse filter and manifold with three rinses of distilled water (≤50 mL each).
- Remove funnel top and wash filter margins to remove salt crystals.
- Remove filter from the manifold with forceps; return to aluminum tray and store in a freezer until drying.

## Determination of blanks
- Blanks account for hygroscopic water changes in filters; at least three blank filters are weighed to establish a mean initial weight.
- Blank correction X = mean(W2) − mean(W1), where W1 is the initial weight and W2 the post-drying weight for blanks.
- X can be positive or negative and should not exceed ±0.5 mg.

## Field duplicates
- Collect two separate samples at the same time and under identical conditions to assess precision of sampling, preservation, storage, and laboratory procedures.

## Filter drying and SPM calculation
- Dry filters in their trays for 1 hour at 75°C; cool in a desiccator.
- Weigh to the nearest 0.01 mg (W2; filter plus particulate matter).
- SPM concentration:
  - CS PM = (W2 − W1 + X) / V, with V in litres; result in mg/L.
  - To convert to mg/m³, multiply by 1000.
- If determining organic/inorganic fractions:
  - Ash filters at 500°C for 3 hours to burn off organics; cool and weigh quickly to obtain W3 (filter plus inorganic fraction).
  - CI = (W3 − W1) / V (mg/L) for inorganic fraction.
  - CO = (W2 − W3) / V (mg/L) for organic fraction.
- Unit conversions:
  - W1, W2, W3 are in mg (convert from g by multiplying by 1000 as needed).
  - V is volume filtered in litres (convert from mL by dividing by 1000 as needed).
