# Determination of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in water by filtration and ignition

## Overview
- Purpose: quantify suspended particulate matter in a water sample by filtering a known volume, weighing the filter before and after filtration, and using ignition at 500°C to separate organic and inorganic fractions if needed.
- Key measurement approach: calculate SPM concentration from weight change (filter + particulates minus initial filter weight) divided by the filtered water volume; optionally determine inorganic and organic fractions after combustion.

## Equipment and consumables
- Drying oven, muffle furnace, filtration manifold for 47 mm filters, vacuum pump, forceps, balance (0.01 mg sensitivity, 5 decimal places), wash bottles, aluminium trays, desiccator, measuring cylinders, sample bottles, 47 mm GF/F filters (0.8 µm), distilled water, plastic sample bags.
- Filters must be hardened (ignited) and handled with forceps; maintain cleanliness to prevent contamination.

## Filter preparation
- Hardening: ignite glass fibre filters at 500°C.
- Pre-wetting: soak filters in distilled water (~5 minutes) to remove soluble material.
- Handling: use forceps for all manipulations; shake off excess water.
- Drying and weighing: dry ~1 hour at 75°C, then cool in a desiccator; weigh each filter with aluminium dish to W1 (nearest 0.01 mg).
- Storage: place weighed filter + dish in a Ziploc and store separately until filtration.

## Filtration procedure
- Sample collection and storage: collect water samples in appropriate bottles and filter promptly; if storage is needed, keep samples at <4°C.
- Filter setup: place weighed filter on the filter base.
- Sample distribution: mix sample bottle contents, then measure a volume into a measuring cylinder and introduce to the filter until filtration is sufficient (usually until the filter clogs).
  - Target total filtered volume: typically 2 mg of particulate material; ocean samples may require 2–5 L, coastal 0.5–1 L.
- Rinsing: rinse solids from the measuring cylinder and pass through the filter; rinse the filter and manifold with distilled water (three rinses, up to 50 mL each).
- Salt removal: wash filter margins to remove salt crystals.
- Post-filtration handling: disconnect vacuum; remove the filter and store in the freezer until ready to dry.

## Determination of blanks
- Blanks address hygroscopic weight changes and sample handling errors.
- Procedure: use at least three blank filters (not used for filtration) to obtain initial and final weights (W1 and W2 after drying).
- Blank correction: X = mean(W2) − mean(W1); absolute value of X should not exceed 0.5 mg (can be positive or negative).
- Note: hygroscopic nature of filters can introduce up to ~0.5 mg error; blanks correct for this.

## Field duplicates
- Collect two separate samples at the same time under identical conditions to assess precision of field collection, preservation, storage, and laboratory procedures.

## Filter drying and SPM calculation
- Drying: dry filters in their aluminium trays for 1 hour at 75°C, then cool in a desiccator.
- Weighing: weigh the filter (W2) to 0.01 mg; this weight includes the filter plus particulate matter.
- SPM concentration: C_SPM = (W2 − W1 + X) / V, where V is the volume of water filtered (in litres). Multiply by 1000 to convert to mg/m³.
- Fractionation (optional):
  - Ignite filters in a muffle furnace for 3 hours at 500°C to remove organic material.
  - Cool and weigh to obtain W3 (filter + inorganic fraction).
  - Organic fraction concentration: CO = (W2 − W3) / V.
  - Inorganic fraction concentration: CI = (W3 − W1) / V.
- Unit conversions:
  - Weights from g to mg multiply by 1000; volumes from mL to L divide by 1000.
  - Final concentrations should be in mg/L (and can be converted to mg/m³ by multiplying by 1000).
