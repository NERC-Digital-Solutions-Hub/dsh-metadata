# Countryside Survey 2007: Pond Condition Survey and Headwater Survey Methodology

- Purpose and scope
  - National GB-scale freshwater survey as part of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007).
  - Headwaters: re-survey of 425 CS2000 headwater squares; macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, hydromorphology (RHS), physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Ponds: random pond sampling in 629 CS2007 squares containing ponds; focus on aquatic plants, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Aims to create a national dataset across water body types to support ecological assessment and trend analysis.

- Headwaters design and sampling elements
  - In headwater squares (425 total): repeat sampling in 500 m stream stretches for macroinvertebrates (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (RHS), aquatic plant community (MTR), physical attributes, and a water chemistry snapshot (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity).
  - In CS2007 pond squares: randomly selected pond within each square for macrophyte survey, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Sampling sites are chosen to maximize representativeness while prioritizing headwater streams and ponds to cover GB-wide diversity.

- Equipment and field logistics
  - Comprehensive field equipment lists (safety gear, sampling nets, field data sheets, GPS, maps, cameras, sampling bottles, filters, fixatives, etc.).
  - Safety considerations and risk assessment for field sampling in varied riverine environments.
  - Large-scale data handling through field digital systems (RAPID for RHS data; IRIS for aquatic plant data) to minimize transcription errors and enable in-field validation.

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS protocol)
  - Sample area: single continuous stream reach (5–15 m) with proportional sampling of habitat types.
  - Primary method: 3-minute pond-net kick sampling plus 1-minute manual search; shift between habitats to maximize taxa captures.
  - Handling and processing: on-site fixation in 40% formalin; samples housed in labeled pots/bags; thorough net cleaning between sites to avoid cross-contamination.
  - Data and forms: RIVPACS Sample Area Form captures: square, river, site, date, NGR, sample method, sample time (3 minutes active + 1 minute manual search), proportionality, photography, width, depth, velocity, substrate, and habitat data.

- Water chemistry sampling (headwaters)
  - Field measurements: conductivity and pH using handheld meters (calibration required); read when stable.
  - Laboratory analyses: filtered SRP, TON, and alkalinity using on-site filtration and labeled 50 ml bottles; samples shipped to CEH Lancaster with standardized sample information sheets.
  - Documentation: Sample Information Sheet records square, waterbody type, date, square, project details, and analytical requirements.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS) and data management
  - RHS aims: assess hydromorphological diversity and condition via standardized indices (RHS 2003 version) for comparability with past CS surveys.
  - Data capture: RAPID field system on Tablet PC with 17 sections across 4 pages; drop-downs to ensure data quality and consistency.
  - Tasks and validation: on-site data entry, built-in validation, and mandatory completion before leaving site.
  - 500 m RHS reach centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site; central focus on habitats, channel features, shading, and water clarity.

- Aquatic plant survey: MTR (Mean Trophic Rank) method and IRIS data entry
  - Macrophyte survey: 100 m reach centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site; walk/wade to record presence and relative cover of submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species.
  - Species identification: aim for species-level identification; a standard taxa list (351 wetland taxa) guides identification and sampling; rare species require confirmation and possible sample submission.
  - Data entry: IRIS field data system for aquatic plant surveys; 2-page form capturing species list, cover categories, and physical site data; validation before submission.
  - Coverage estimation: use a 9-point scale for percent cover; guidance provided for consistent estimation across 100 m reach.

- Pond condition survey: overview and field protocol
  - Mapping phase: mappers identify all ponds in the square and designate a survey pond per square; ponds defined as standing water 25 m2 to 2 ha present for at least four months.
  - Field teams: two surveyors (to manage safety and workload) conduct macrophyte survey, environmental characteristics, water chemistry, and pond measurements.
  - Survey steps (condensed): obtain pond mapping, photograph pond with square number, delineate outer pond boundary, sketch boundary, estimate area, measure drawdown height, assess water presence, record sediment and pond base composition, document pollutants, inflows/outflows, and surrounding land use; assess pond management and wildlife use (grazing, water birds, fish, amphibians); evaluate amenity value and public access.
  - Macrophyte survey: survey within outer boundary; record all wetland plants; identify to species where possible; use grapnels and wading for submerged plants; detach and press specimens for lab confirmation when needed.
  - Data handling and specimens: field forms include pond condition sheets and macrophyte recording; specimens submitted to Pond Conservation with proper labeling and preservation (pressed or preserved in alcohol for Charophytes).
  - Sampling and labeling: robust labeling and multiple containers recommended for large samples; TREM transport card used for macroinvertebrate samples in transit; routine submission cadence (monthly-ish) to CEH Dorset for processing.

- Quality control and assurance
  - Certification and training: all RHS macroinvertebrate surveyors hold Environment Agency RHS certification; field teams trained in RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling and MTR aquatic plant surveying; team rotations to maintain consistency.
  - Audits: roughly 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; on-site field supervision possible.
  - Field survey checklist: joint completion by surveyors (CS square, date, surveyors, activities completed) to ensure no tasks are missed.

- Data flows, outputs, and references
  - Data captured in field through RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (aquatic plants); macroinvertebrate data consolidated via RIVPACS forms; pond data compiled on CS2007 pond sheets.
  - Final deliverables include field sheets, plant specimens, water samples, photographs, and mapping data; samples transported to CEH laboratories or Pond Conservation per guidelines.
  - References and foundational manuals cited (Environment Agency RHS manual 2003, Murray-Bligh 1999, Holmes et al. 1999 MTR, Raven et al. 1998 RHS, Stewart 2004 on macrophyte sampling, etc.).

- Endnotes and contact
  - Administrative and contact details for sample submission, transport, and project coordination provided (CEH, Pond Conservation, and project office contacts).
  - The document situates CS2007 within a broader national program funded by NERC, Defra, and partner bodies, emphasizing standardized, QA-driven data collection for robust ecological indicators.
