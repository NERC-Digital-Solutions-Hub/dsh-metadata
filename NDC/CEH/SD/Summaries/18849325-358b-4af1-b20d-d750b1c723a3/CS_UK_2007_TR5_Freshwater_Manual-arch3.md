# Countryside Survey 2007

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to identify environmental health measures for scrutinising policy, evaluating outcomes, and informing future decisions.
  - Built as a nationwide monitoring framework with coordinated protocols across headwaters, rivers, ponds, and aquatic plants.

- Organizational context and approach
  - Authors: John Murphy and Anita Weatherby, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (NERC).
  - Operates through managerial-level roles within government/quangos, responsible for deciding on and implementing monitoring approaches.
  - Emphasizes stakeholder engagement, learning from others, and avoiding duplication.
  - Data are sourced, verified, and often require added metadata; data governance and openness are central.
  - Data are quality assured, cleaned, transformed, analyzed, and presented via reports, charts, and dashboards; outputs are disseminated with stakeholder consultation.

- Data governance, metadata, and openness
  - Coordinated data gathering and sharing practices, with explicit attention to metadata quality and standardisation.
  - Public sharing of underlying data is encouraged but can pose barriers; governance processes are implemented to manage storage and sharing.

- Monitoring components and data systems
  - Macroinvertebrate, aquatic plant, physicochemical, and hydromorphological data are integrated to assess environmental status.
  - Field data capture is digitally integrated in the field (on Tablet PCs) using standardized systems to reduce errors and enable on-site validation.

- Key field survey components and methods
  - Headwaters (CS2007)
    - All 425 GB headwater squares to be re-surveyed; sampling includes macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS), RHS hydromorphology, water chemistry, and aquatic plant community.
    - 500 m sampling stretch for RHS with a nested 100 m aquatic plant survey; sampling points and site selection designed to maximize representativeness and comparability with CS2000.
    - Sampling procedures emphasize safety, task sequencing, and detailed field data capture (area, width, depth, velocity, substrate, channel features, land use, etc.).
    - Data tools: RIVPACS (macroinvertebrates and environmental data), RAPID (RHS field data), IRIS (aquatic plant data). On-site validation is mandatory.
    - Documentation includes site photographs with markers, detailed site environment forms, and sketch maps for relocation.
    - Quality control: EA accreditation for RHS, RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling, MTR plant surveying; ~7% of headwater sites audited; team rotation to maintain consistency.

  - Pond Condition Survey
    - All ponds within the square identified and mapped; one pond per square designated as the survey pond for macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry assessment.
    - Two surveyors collaborate to mitigate safety risks; standard pond condition protocols include turbidity estimation, water chemistry, environmental survey (amenity use), macrophyte survey, and specimen handling.
    - Macrophyte survey: 100 m reach surveyed for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species; species identification to as fine a taxonomic level as possible; use of lab confirmation for difficult taxa; designated handling for rare or protected species.
    - Sampling and preservation: systematic collection and lab confirmation of specimens; documentation and tracking of samples (including “voucher” specimens and digital records); samples transported to CEH Dorset; formaldehyde preservative and precise labeling required.
    - Pond mapping and morphology: boundary delineation, pond area estimation, drawdown height, water depth measurements across transects, sediment and pond base composition, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, and surrounding land use.
    - Environmental and amenity data: assessment of grazing, waterbird use, fish and amphibian presence, surrounding land use in two distance zones (0-5 m and 0-100 m), and amenity value (view, public access, and use).
    - Macrophyte survey technique: field-guided identification and abundance estimates; specialist specimen handling for difficult taxa; rare species confirmation workflow (including licenses where needed).
    - Documentation and workflow: standardized CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets; photographic documentation; data back to Pond Conservation for processing.

- Data capture and field workflows
  - On-site data capture systems (RAPID for RHS; IRIS for aquatic plants) provide structured, drop-down-driven forms to improve data quality and enable real-time validation.
  - Data validation is mandatory on site; forms prompt for missing data and inconsistencies, guiding immediate corrections.
  - Field survey checklists ensure completion of all components before leaving sites; strict transit and storage protocols for macroinvertebrate and plant specimens, including TREM transport cards and clear labeling.

- Equipment, safety, and logistics
  - Extensive equipment provisioning per team, including safety gear, surveying instruments, navigation aids, sampling nets, fixatives, and transport packaging.
  - Health and safety considerations emphasize site risk assessment, safe sampling practices, and coordination between surveyors.
  - Transport and storage: samples stored in designated boxes with TREM cards; monthly courier dispatch to CEH Dorset; coordinated postal and courier arrangements for plant specimens.

- Data integration, outputs, and collaboration
  - Data flow integrates macroinvertebrate (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (RHS), aquatic plants (MTR via IRIS), and pond environmental data to form a comprehensive environmental health picture.
  - The field data systems (RAPID, IRIS) are designed to mimic traditional paper forms while enabling on-site validation and streamlined data export to central databases.
  - The program aligns with established methodologies (RHS 2003, MTR/Holmes et al. 1999, RIVPACS) to ensure comparability with prior surveys (CS1990, CS2000) and future datasets.
  - Final objectives include producing data suitable for policy evaluation and decision-making, with a robust framework for data sharing and governance.

- References and governance backbone
  - Methodological foundations and calibration draw on Environment Agency guidelines (RHS 2003), MTR protocol, RIVPACS, and related scholarly sources.
  - The Countryside Survey in 2007 was funded through a government partnership led by NERC and Defra, with CEH coordinating methodological development and field implementation.
