# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and site anonymity.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and continued landowner permission for future surveys.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004 through CEH on behalf of NERC and partners.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Access allows identification of whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing a CS square.
- Six-digit grid references require pre-processing by CEH to avoid disclosure, except in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features) carry confidentiality comparable to location data and are released only under the same exceptional terms.
- Exceptional release requires demonstration (in legal terms) that IP data (data, models, etc.) carried equal/higher confidentiality than CS data and cannot be released to CEH for processing.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals for the approved project.
- Licences granted for finite periods; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- Post-licence, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; seek CEH advice if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Licences for four-digit grid references are similar to six-digit but do not require the same IP confidentiality threshold.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences; signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising access applications, decisions, and grounds for decisions.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing analysis support within moderate demand; requests from other organizations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with CEH before committing to data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be direct or advisory, with possible negotiation of collaboration or payment.
