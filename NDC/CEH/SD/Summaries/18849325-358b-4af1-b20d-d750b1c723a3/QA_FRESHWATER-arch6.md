# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Purpose and scope
  - Assess quality assurance (QA) for CS2007 freshwater data to quantify uncertainty in field data, derived metrics, and to baseline future surveys.
  - Focus on QA of field surveys (not yet included macroinvertebrate results in this report).

- Field survey design
  - Random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares across environmental zones and CS teams.
  - Re-surveyed: streams in all 31 squares (8% effort) and ponds in 18 squares (7% effort).
  - Re-survey procedures replicated main CS2007 methods to test repeatability.

- Data collection methods and instruments
  - Aquatic plants (streams): 100 m survey stretch re-located using photographs, grid refs, maps; IRIS on Tablet PC for data entry.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS): 500 m reach re-located with identical photographic/grid/map references; RAPID on Tablet PC used for data entry.
  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates: standard sampling protocols re-used; samples processed by CEH River Communities Group.
  - Hydrochemistry: on-site pH/conductivity; lab analyses for phosphate, nitrogen, alkalinity.
  - Pond aquatic plants: standard pond surveys; similar relocation and data entry protocols.
  - Pond hydrochemistry: lab analyses complemented by on-site pH/conductivity.

- Aquatic plants (streams) – key findings
  - Taxa detection: main CS2007 surveys recorded significantly fewer taxa than QA; mean difference of about 1.9 taxa (QA higher).
  - Agreement: mean taxon agreement between main and QA was about 31%; 100% agreement only when a single species was found in both.
  - Error drivers: rare taxa misidentifications/search limitations, exact stretch location, seasonal timing, vegetation cutting.
  - Derived metrics: QA tended to yield higher MTR scores by about 5.6 points on average (not statistically significant).
  - Implications: large repeatability challenges for aquatic plant surveys; CS2007 main data treated as baseline with awareness of plant identification/search issues.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS) – key findings
  - Bridge/culvert counts: 70% of sites showed no difference; some sites differed by ±1 or ±2.
  - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA): main survey generally scored higher than QA by about 6.9 units; differences largely due to subjective classification of bank-face and bank-top vegetation, especially in upland moorland.
  - Implications: variability in subjective judgments; no CS2000 QA data, so assume similar bias; proceed with CS2007 RHS data with caution.

- Hydrochemistry – key findings
  - Rank correlations between main and QA: strong for most parameters (soluble reactive phosphorus r=0.89; alkalinity r=0.97; pH r=0.74; conductivity r=0.97; TON r=0.79).
  - Interpretation: field and laboratory procedures are consistently applied; results are reliable for ranking sites, though absolute TON values showed more variability.

- Wetland plants (ponds) – key findings
  - Pond surveys: 16 ponds surveyed in both main and QA.
  - Taxa detection: no significant overall bias; main tended to find 0.6 more taxa on average; mean agreement about 59%.
  - Missing taxa: 36 taxa missed across surveys; most missed were grasses/sedges/rushes and small submerged aquatic taxa.
  - Boundary and timing issues: boundary definition (pond footprint) and seasonal shifts contributed to discrepancies.
  - Implications: pond plant surveys show moderate repeatability; grasses/rushes require targeted training to improve detection.

- Discussion and implications for data use
  - Inherent uncertainty in environmental measurements; QA provides baseline to quantify variability, inform training, and refine protocols.
  - Major sources of variation: spatial (survey stretch location), temporal (seasonal/change), and inter-surveyor competence (identification and search thoroughness); temporal errors particularly impact plant surveys.
  - Practical recommendations
    - Improve identification skills for bryophytes and algae; train on inconspicuous grass-like species.
    - Emphasize returning exactly to the previous survey stretch; reduce temporal gaps where possible.
    - Strengthen RHS training for subjective judgments of bank vegetation structure.
    - Schedule QA surveys within two weeks of main survey completion to minimize temporal drift.
  - Overall conclusion: CS2007 QA provides a valuable baseline to assess future freshwater data quality, identify vulnerable data elements, and guide training and protocol improvements. Macroinvertebrate QA analyses and final freshwater report are anticipated later (late 2009).

- Outputs and next steps
  - QA findings will inform targeted training and protocol refinements ahead of the next Countryside Survey.
  - Specific focus areas for improvement include bryophyte/algae identification, grass-like taxa detection, precise re-location of survey stretches, and clearer delineation of survey boundaries.
  - Freshwater QA report sets the stage for integrating macroinvertebrate QA results (expected in the main Freshwaters Report).
