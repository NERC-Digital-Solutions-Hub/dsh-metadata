# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- The freshwater module of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) aimed to provide high-quality information on changes in the physical and biological condition of small streams and ponds across Great Britain, including changes in biodiversity distribution.
- The QA focus of this report is to quantify the uncertainty associated with field data collection and to baseline future surveys.

## Aims of the QA effort

- Assess and quantify the variation/error introduced by field surveyors and methods.
- Inform improvements in training, protocols, and data handling to support reliable change detection and policy evaluation.
- Provide a baseline for future CS freshwater surveys and identify plant groups or features requiring greater expertise.

## Sampling design and QA approach

- Field: random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares surveyed in CS2007; an experienced CEH freshwater biologist re-sampled the same locations to assess repeatability and error.
- Scope: majority of re-surveys targeted streams; 18 of 31 squares contained ponds (re-surveyed).
- Methods re-checked:
  - Aquatic plants (streams)
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates (streams)
  - Hydrochemistry (streams)
  - Aquatic plants (ponds) and hydrochemistry (ponds)
- Re-survey effort: ~8% for streams; ~7% for ponds.

## Key method details by component

- Aquatic Plants (streams)
  - Re-surveyed 30 of 31 stream sites; relocation relied on photographs, grid refs, and maps; data recorded with IRIS.
  - Plant data validated post-survey, taxonomic standardisation performed.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - Re-survey aligned with same 500 m reach; relocation aided by photographs, grid refs, and maps; data recorded with RAPID.
- Aquatic Macroinvertebrates
  - Samples taken using standard protocols; processed by CEH River Communities Group.
- Hydrochemistry (streams)
  - On-site pH and conductivity; lab analysis for phosphate, nitrogen, alkalinity; samples analyzed by ISO 17025-accredited CEH lab.
- Aquatic Plants (ponds)
  - 18 ponds re-surveyed; similar protocols as streams; taxonomic validation and boundary definitions relevant to pond surveys.
- Wetland/ponds data (plant taxa)
  - Compare taxa richness and survey concordance between main CS2007 team and QA surveyors.

## Main findings

- Aquatic plants (streams)
  - Main survey tended to record fewer taxa than QA surveyors; significant bias detected in taxa richness.
  - Mean agreement between CS2007 and QA plant lists: 31% (N=29 sites with taxa data); only 100% agreement when very few taxa were present.
  - Most discrepancies involve rare taxa (less than 1% cover) and issues such as misidentifications, searching thoroughness, exact location of the 100 m stretch, seasonal differences, vegetation cutting, and defining survey boundaries.
  - QA surveys tended to score higher on the MTR (mean +5.6, not statistically significant) with wide variability.
  - Implication: plant surveys are difficult to reproduce; CS2007 main data can proceed with awareness of bias; QA provides a baseline for improving field protocols and identifying taxa groups needing more expertise.
- RHS (streams)
  - 70% of sites showed no difference in counts of bridges or culverts; some discrepancies within ±1 were observed.
  - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) values showed notable differences between main and QA surveys, with the main survey on average scoring higher by about 6.9 units.
  - Differences largely due to subjective classification of bank-face and bank-top vegetation, especially in upland moorland landscapes where vegetation types were interpreted differently (e.g., “Simple” vs “Uniform”).
  - No CS2000 QA data available; precautionary assumption that CS2000 and CS2007 biases are similar, allowing analysis of CS2007 RHS data to proceed with caution.
- Hydrochemistry (streams)
  - Rankings between main and QA surveys were strongly correlated across five parameters: soluble reactive phosphorus (r=0.89), total oxidised nitrogen (r=0.79), alkalinity (r=0.97), pH (r=0.74), conductivity (r=0.97). This supports consistency and reliability of field and lab procedures for most parameters, despite natural short-term variability.
  - TON showed some divergence between main and QA data, particularly where two ponds had substantial differences, potentially influenced by a two-month gap between visits.
- Wetland plants (ponds)
  - 16 ponds with both main and QA data showed no significant bias; main survey found slightly more taxa on average (0.6 more taxa, not significant).
  - Mean agreement 59% (some ponds had 100% agreement); common missed taxa included grasses, sedges, rushes, submerged aquatics; temporal differences and boundary definitions contributed to discrepancies.
  - TON in ponds also showed variability; overall correlations strong for most parameters, reinforcing general data reliability with caveats about timing.
- Overall uncertainties and causes
  - Uncertainty arises from spatial (location of stretches and boundaries), temporal (seasonal or disturbance-driven changes), and inter-surveyor competence (identification and thoroughness) factors.
  - Temporal mismatch between main and QA surveys was a key challenge, reducing ability to attribute errors to inter-surveyor differences alone.
  - Subjective elements in RHS and some plant classifications contribute to variability, particularly in lines where vegetation structure is interpreted differently.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks and data governance

- QA data provide a baseline to gauge repeatability and inform improvements in field protocols, training, and data handling for future surveys.
- The exercise highlights which elements are most error-prone and should be targeted in training (e.g., aquatic bryophytes, algae, inconspicuous grasses, precise relocation of survey stretches, and boundary definitions).
- Temporal proximity between main and QA surveys is critical; best practice is to conduct QA within a short window (ideally within two weeks).
- The need for clearer data governance and metadata standards is underscored, particularly around sharing underlying data, handling taxonomic updates, and ensuring consistent data formats across surveys.
- The report indicates macroinvertebrate QA results will be provided in late 2009, suggesting ongoing QA integration across biological components.

## Conclusions and recommendations

- The CS2007 freshwater QA survey establishes a baseline for understanding data quality and the variability in freshwater measurements across Britain.
- It identifies key sources of error and areas for targeted training and protocol refinement:
  - Improved identification skills for bryophytes, algae, and grass-like taxa.
  - Greater emphasis on precise re-location of survey stretches and consistent boundary definitions.
  - Enhanced RHS training to reduce subjective classification differences, especially in moorland contexts.
- Two-week window between main and QA surveys is recommended to minimize temporal error.
- The QA findings support continuing use of CS2007 data for change assessment, while highlighting the need to interpret plant and RHS-derived indices with awareness of potential biases.
- The Freshwater QA report will inform improvements for the next Countryside Survey and guide enhancements in field protocols and data management.
