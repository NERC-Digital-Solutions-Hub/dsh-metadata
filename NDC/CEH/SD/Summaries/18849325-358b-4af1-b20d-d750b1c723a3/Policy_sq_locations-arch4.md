# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim
- Maximise the utility of CS spatial data in the public interest while minimising the risk of compromising future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Current CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations of CS squares are confidential
- To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys to maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land.
- Compromising confidentiality would weaken ability to inform future environmental policy.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Circumstances for release and level of precision
- Location data can show whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class or Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing a square.
- Six-digit (precise) location data require pre-processing analysis by CEH to avoid release; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, external release under licence may be allowed if the requester demonstrates equal or higher confidentiality/protection for IP/data than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (habitats, linear features) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- Any release must not enable locating squares directly or indirectly through related data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are for finite periods and specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- At license end, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations or claim to have done so.

## Responsibilities
- CS data owners (NERC) decide on exceptional releases via CEH.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, with clauses reflecting the policy; licences must be signed by a senior authorised signatory.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decisions.
- For internal CS partner use, CEH aims to provide reasonable preprocessing support within moderate demand; other organisations’ requests are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH may be involved as part of collaboration or for payment, negotiated case-by-case.
