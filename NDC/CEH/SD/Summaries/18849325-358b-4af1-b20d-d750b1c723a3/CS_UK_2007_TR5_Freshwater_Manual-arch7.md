# HEADWATERS

- Purpose and scope
  - Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) headwaters program aims to re-survey freshwater reaches across GB, focusing on macroinvertebrate communities, aquatic plant communities, hydromorphology, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - 425 CS2000 squares are re-surveyed for headwaters (macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, RHS hydromorphology, physical characteristics, water chemistry) as part of the headwater module.
  - In 629 CS2007 squares containing ponds, a randomly selected pond is surveyed for aquatic macrophyte community, physical characteristics, and water chemistry (100 m macrophyte survey length within the pond reach).

- Spatial design and sampling framework
  - Headwaters: 500 m River Habitat Survey (RHS) reach centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site; 100 m aquatic macrophyte (MTR) survey length centered on RHS/macoinvertebrate point; sampling of RHS environmental data and water chemistry within the 500 m reach.
  - Ponds: 100 m aquatic macrophyte survey length within ponds, plus pond physical characteristics and water chemistry.
  - Location data: precise GPS/NGR coordinates recorded for sampling points (NGR to at least 8-digit grid reference); detailed site relocation features and sketch maps to aid future relocation.

- Data collection and on-site data capture
  - On-site digital data entry via RAPID (River Habitat Survey field data entry system) for RHS data; IRIS for aquatic macrophyte data.
  - Tablet-based data collection mirrors the 2003 RHS form structure and the MTR macrophyte survey protocol; validation occurs in-field before leaving the site.
  - Photographs required for macroinvertebrate sampling area, RHS reach, and aquatic plant survey areas; marker boards used to aid relocation.
  - Field forms and data capture emphasize standardized, drop-down driven inputs to minimize free text errors.

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (Headwaters)
  - Objective: maximize taxa collected within a single continuous sampling reach (typically 5–15 m wide, 3 minutes of active sampling with a pond-net, plus mandatory manual search).
  - Net and sampling protocol: standard pond-net (25 cm2 area, 900 µm mesh); maintain net cleanliness; sample areas proportionally to habitat cover; avoid samples spanning too wide a range of habitats.
  - Manual search: two parts totaling 1 minute to collect surface-dwelling and attached organisms; time-bound to ensure comparability.
  - Sample handling: retain only water enough to keep organisms damp; fix in 4% formaldehyde equivalent; careful labeling and storage in labeled pots and bags; cross-site net cleaning to avoid cross-contamination.
  - Data capture: macroinvertebrate sampling area forms (RIVPACS sample area form) capturing square, river, site, date, GPS, sample method, sample time, proportionality, photography, water width, depth, velocity, substrate, and habitat data.

- Water chemistry sampling (Headwaters)
  - On-site readings: conductivity and pH measured in the field using a hand-held meter; calibration and cleaning protocols outlined.
  - Filtered samples: SRP, TON, and alkalinity measured from a filtered water sample (on-site filtration with 0.45 µm filters; 50 mL bottles labeled with project, waterbody type, square, date).
  - Sample handling: meticulous filtration procedure with controlled syringe filtration; samples mailed in padded envelopes with sample information sheets to the CEH lab.
  - Documentation: sample information sheets capture square, waterbody type, date, and project identifiers; all data entered onto RIVPACS sample area forms.

- RHS (River Habitat Survey) data collection and entry
  - RHS protocol: 500 m RHS reach, with a 3D layout of spot-checks and channel features; data entered via RAPID on a Tablet PC.
  - Data structure: 17 sections across 4 pages; Section A–L/Sections for spot-checks, physical attributes, bank profiles, vegetation, channel features, dimensions, and notable features; validation via on-site data checks.
  - Relocation and mapping: include fixed landmarks, distances, grid north, scale, and relocation features on a sketch map of the 500 m reach.
  - Data validation: RAPID performs sequential, on-site data validation; must be completed before leaving the site.

- Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR) and IRIS data entry
  - MTR method: 100 m reach walk to record presence and percent cover of macrophyte and bryophyte species; identify plants to species level where possible; use 9-point cover scales for each species; systematic approach recommended.
  - Sampling technique: wading or grapnel for submerged plants; careful traversal to ensure representative coverage of habitats; explicit handling of rare or uncertain identifications.
  - Data entry: IRIS field data entry system captures plant species and their cover within the 100 m reach; specimen handling and identifications, including cases requiring lab confirmation, are documented.
  - Data quality: field data validated by IRIS checks; samples for indeterminate taxa are prepared for expert confirmation; plant specimens may be sent for identification with appropriate labeling.

- Pond condition survey (CS2007)
  - Overview: pond mapping by mappers identifies all ponds in a square; a designated survey pond is selected for macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry survey; two surveyors collaborate due to safety concerns.
  - Fieldwork workflow: photograph pond; identify outer boundary; sketch outline and estimate pond area; measure drawdown height; estimate water coverage; assess sediment and pond base; identify inflows/outflows and flow rates; record pond management, grazing, waterbird and fish/amphibian presence, surrounding land use, and amenity value.
  - Measurement and recording: turbidity estimation; water chemistry (pH, conductivity) with on-site sampling for SRP/TON/Alk; detailed sediment and pond base characterization; pollution and inflows/outflows documentation.
  - Macrophyte survey within ponds: record submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent macrophyte species within the pond boundary; identify to species level where possible; provide abundance estimates using supplied scales.
  - Rare species and specimen handling: special provisions for rare species; collect representative samples for lab confirmation when necessary; use photographic evidence when appropriate.
  - Field sheets and submission: pencil-based fieldsheets; ensure all sections are completed; return and dispatch samples and fieldsheets to Pond Conservation; follow transport and labeling protocols (including TREM cards for hazardous materials).

- Data management, QA, and logistics
  - Data capture systems: RAPID for RHS hydromorphology and macroinvertebrate data; IRIS for aquatic plant data; standardized forms and on-site validation to improve data quality.
  - Geospatial and relocation needs: emphasis on precise GPS/NGR coordinates, relocation features, and sketch maps to facilitate future site relocation for repeat surveys.
  - Quality control: Environment Agency RHS accreditation; training in RIVPACS, MTR, and chemical sampling; team rotation to maintain consistency; ~7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; on-site field survey checklists used.
  - Sample transit: macroinvertebrate and plant specimens shipped in labeled containers with Transport Emergency Card (TREM) and to CEH Dorset with specific courier instructions; ensure timely dispatch to minimize degradation.
  - Pond mapping and coordination: mappers prepare pond mapping sheets; ponds crossing square boundaries surveyed in full; coordination between pond mapping and field survey teams.

- Practical notes and references
  - Key references include Environment Agency guidance (River Habitat Survey, RHS 2003 version) and MTR macrophyte methodology; field techniques for kick-sampling, plant identification, and sample processing are described in detail.
  - Documentation emphasizes thorough labeling, standardized abbreviations, and careful recording of all conditions, including access limitations and areas not surveyable within a given square.

- Endnotes and contact
  - The manual provides contact points for CEH and Pond Conservation for sample confirmation and submission workflows; data and field protocols are tied to ongoing Countryside Survey (CS) objectives and publications.

- Overall takeaway for GIS-focused use
  - The CS2007 Headwaters program delivers spatially explicit, standards-driven datasets across macroinvertebrates (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (RHS), and macrophytes (MTR/IRIS), plus pond condition data, all tied to precise geolocations (NGR/8-digit grid refs) and 500 m RHS reaches or 100 m pond macrophyte segments.
  - Data products are designed for map-based visualization, cross-square comparability, and relocation over time, enabling policy, conservation, and public-facing GIS outputs with integrated quality assurance and traceable provenance.
