# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Overview
  - Policy to maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and securing future survey permissions.
  - Public interest to protect these aspects; requests handled by CEH for NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- When and how locations may be released (and precision levels)
  - Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square a CS square falls in.
  - Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; applicant must prove legally that their IP/data require equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.
  - If precise location data is essential, CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing exact locations.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licences: must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and accessed only by named individuals with legitimate need for the project.
  - Finite licence periods; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
  - No third-party release or use that could compromise square locations; no use to identify landowner locations or to plan visits.
  - If requested, evidence of project management standards (at least JCOP level) may be required.
  - Four-digit releases have lighter IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; four-digit releases must not be used to derive precise locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - Denials follow statutory Act/Regulation procedures; CEH provides annual reporting on licence applications and decisions.
  - CEH aims to support internal partner data use with timely pre-processing analysis; requests from external organisations are case-by-case.
  - Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may provide scientific guidance or collaborative support as negotiated.

- How this applies to data support practice
  - Data support can facilitate compliant access by coordinating licensing, secure data handling, and controlled dissemination of outputs.
  - Focus on enabling self-serve analytics via aggregated or licence-compliant outputs (e.g., four-digit grid-based insights) without exposing precise locations.
  - Manage requests, track licence periods, ensure data destruction at project end, and maintain documentation for JCOP-equivalent standards.
  - Provide guidance on data preparation and preprocessing to minimize need for exposing exact locations while still delivering useful insights.
  - Liaise with CEH for pre-processing services when possible to avoid unnecessary release of sensitive location data.
