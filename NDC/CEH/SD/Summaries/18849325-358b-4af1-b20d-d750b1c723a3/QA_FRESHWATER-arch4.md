# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Purpose and context
  - CS2007 freshwater module aimed to provide high-quality data on the physical and biological condition of headwater streams and ponds across Great Britain, including changes in biodiversity distribution.
  - The QA effort establishes how reliable the data are and acts as a baseline for improving future surveys.

- QA design and standards
  - Three-pronged QA approach:
    - Field surveyors: rigorous training in aquatic plant taxonomy; River Habitat Survey (RHS) accreditation; field biologist supervision to ensure methods are followed.
    - Laboratory procedures: water chemistry analysed by ISO 17025-accredited CEH lab; macroinvertebrate processing under CEH River Communities Group protocols; taxonomic accreditation from the Natural History Museum.
    - Uncertainty quantification: experienced CEH biologist repeated freshwater tasks on a random-stratified sub-sample to assess error/variation.

- Field survey methods and sampling design
  - 31 random-stratified squares re-surveyed; streams re-sampled in all 31; ponds re-surveyed in 18 of 31 squares.
  - Re-survey effort: ~8% for stream tasks; ~7% for pond tasks.
  - Data collection tools: aquatic plants (IRIS on Tablet PC) and RHS (RAPID on Tablet PC); standardized protocols referenced in CS Technical Report No. 5/07.

- Data validation and handling
  - Aquatic plant data validated with taxonomic standardisation and removal of terrestrial species before comparison.
  - Wetland plant data for ponds also validated and used as baseline for pond surveys.

- Key findings by component
  - Aquatic plants (streams)
    - Significant bias: main CS2007 survey tended to record ~1.9 fewer taxa than QA (P < 0.001).
    - Mean taxon agreement between main and QA: ~31% (100% agreement only when only one species occurred in both surveys).
    - Most discrepancies due to misidentifications, searching thoroughness, slight relocation of the 100 m stretch, seasonal differences, and vegetation changes between surveys.
    - Rare taxa (e.g., certain bryophytes, algae, and grass-like species) were most often missed; errors predominantly involved overlooked taxa rather than misidentifications.
    - Impact on derived scores (MTR): QA tended to score higher by ~5.6 points, though not statistically significant; substantial site-by-site variation observed.
    - Conclusion: aquatic plant repeatability is challenging; CS2007 plant data can be analyzed as is but with awareness of data quality issues; QA provides a baseline to improve field protocols and identify taxa needing more training.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - 70% of sites showed no difference in bridge/culvert counts; some sites varied by ±1 or ±2 due to small stretch relocation differences.
    - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) scores showed a systematic bias: main survey tended to yield higher scores by ~6.9 units (P < 0.001).
    - Variation largely due to subjective classification of bank-face and bank-vegetation structure, especially in moorland/rich vegetation contexts.
    - No CS2000 QA data; authors assume similar bias for CS2000 and CS2007, thus no correction to main RHS data beyond mindful interpretation.
  - Hydrochemistry (streams)
    - Rank correlations between main and QA very strong for most parameters (soluble reactive phosphorus r=0.89; alkalinity r=0.97; pH r=0.74; conductivity r=0.97; TON r=0.79, TON t-test non-significant).
    - These correlations support consistent field and lab procedures and reliable results.
    - Timing matters: TON differences between main and QA in two ponds with a ~2-month gap; highlights need to keep QA and main surveys close in time.
  - Wetland plants (ponds)
    - 16 ponds compared; no significant bias overall (main found ~0.6 more taxa on average; P>0.214).
    - Mean taxon agreement ~59%; 100% agreement at five ponds.
    - Discrepancies due to misidentifications, boundary definition of ponds, and seasonal shifts.
    - Some taxa (especially grasses, sedges, and rushes) were more frequently missed; seven taxa missed at more than one site, notably Juncus effusus and Agrostis stolonifera.
  - Overall QA scope
    - This was CS2007 freshwater QA; macroinvertebrate QA analysis results to be reported later (late 2009).

- Implications for data quality and governance
  - Uncertainty is inherent in environmental measurement; QA provides baseline variability to improve confidence in change detection.
  - Variation arises from spatial (survey stretch location), temporal (seasonal change, disturbance), and inter-surveyor competence (identify taxa, survey thoroughness).
  - For robust data governance, aim to minimize temporal gaps between main and QA surveys and improve standardization of subjective assessments (e.g., RHS bank vegetation classifications).
  - The QA exercise informs targeted training and protocol refinements, especially for bryophyte/algae identification, grass-like taxa, and precise relocation of survey stretches.

- Recommendations and next steps
  - Training enhancements:
    - Greater emphasis on aquatic bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grass-like taxa.
    - Improve guidance and standardization for classifying bank vegetation and other subjective RHS elements.
  - Field protocol improvements:
    - Ensure QA work is conducted within two weeks of the main survey at the same site to reduce temporal bias.
    - Improve procedures to precisely relocate the previous survey stretch and define lateral survey boundaries.
  - Data interpretation and use:
    - Treat CS2007 as a baseline for future freshwater data quality; use QA findings to refine field protocols and identify areas needing greater expertise.
    - When communicating trends, consider potential plant survey biases and RHS subjectivity in interpretation.
  - Future reporting:
    - Macroinvertebrate QA results to be published in the Freshwater Technical Report (late 2009) to complete the QA picture across freshwater components.

- Conclusion
  - The CS2007 freshwater QA survey provides essential insight into the reliability and repeatability of field and lab procedures, highlighting where training and protocols can be strengthened.
  - The exercise establishes a defensible baseline for evaluating future CS freshwater data quality and change detection, guiding targeted improvements in data collection, processing, and stewardship.
