# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and obtaining landowner permission.
- Public release could compromise future surveys and policy-relevant insights.

## Circumstances for release and precision
- Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify 10x10 km grid squares (approximate location).
- Six-digit grid references: only in very exceptional circumstances under licence; applicant must show legal risk/importance and that their IP/data carries equal/higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within survey squares (habitats, features): could be used to infer square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.
- In all cases, releases are controlled and granted under licence with strict terms.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration and for specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end and confirmation provided.
- No data or derived information may be shared with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases; license agreements include a clause preventing attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences (for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data) signed by a senior authorised official.
- If a release is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH may provide reasonable pre-processing support to CS partners; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data; CEH may assist in defining requirements and/or support appropriate use, potentially via collaboration or payment negotiations.
