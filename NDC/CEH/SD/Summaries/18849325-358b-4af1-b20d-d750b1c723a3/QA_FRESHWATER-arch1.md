# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Purpose and scope
  - Countryside Survey 2007 freshwater module aimed to provide high-quality information on changes in the physical and biological condition of small streams and ponds across Great Britain, including changes in components of biological diversity.
  - Aimed to quantify uncertainty in data collection and establish a baseline for future surveys.

- QA design and field sampling
  - Ensured field surveyors had strong aquatic plant taxonomy knowledge; River Habitat Survey (RHS) accreditation; field biologist oversight in the field.
  - Laboratory procedures: CEH ISO 17025-accredited lab for water chemistry; macroinvertebrate processing via CEH River Communities Group with Natural History Museum accreditation.
  - Uncertainty quantified by repeating freshwater tasks on a random-stratified subsample.
  - 31 squares re-surveyed (8% stream, 7% pond re-survey); 30 of 31 streams re-surveyed for aquatic plants; 18 ponds re-surveyed.

- Key findings by data type

  - Aquatic plants (streams)
    - Taxa richness bias: main CS2007 survey tended to find 1.9 fewer taxa than the QA survey.
    - Agreement: mean site-level taxon agreement 31%; 100% agreement only where a single species was recorded by both surveys.
    - Most discrepancies involved rare taxa; majority of errors occurred when taxa were overlooked by the main surveyor (about 60%).
    - On average, QA surveys scored 5.6 higher in multivariate taxa richness (MTR) than the main survey (not statistically significant).
    - Even with the same-day/nearby sampling, substantial differences in species lists were observed (57% agreement at streams where both surveyed on CS2007).
    - Conclusion: aquatic plant surveys are highly challenging to repeat; the QA data serve as a baseline for improving field protocols and targeting training.

  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - Bridges/culverts: 70% of sites showed no difference; small discrepancies at some sites likely due to slight relocation of the 500 m reach.
    - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA): main survey tended to produce higher HQA scores by about 6.9 units on average; upland/moorland sites showed greatest disparity due to subjective classifications of bank-face and bank-vegetation structure.
    - Result: variability largely arises from subjective judgments in vegetation structure rather than counts of physical features.

  - Hydrochemistry (streams)
    - Rank correlations between main and QA data were strong for all five measured parameters:
      - Soluble reactive phosphorus: r = 0.89
      - Total oxidised nitrogen: r = 0.79
      - Alkalinity: r = 0.97
      - pH: r = 0.74
      - Conductivity: r = 0.97
    - Indicates consistent application of field and laboratory procedures and reliable measurement/repetition for these parameters.
    - Temporal factors and short-interval variation acknowledged; close timing between main and QA sampling recommended.

  - Wetland plants (ponds)
    - 16 ponds surveyed in both main and QA efforts.
    - No significant bias: main survey found on average 0.6 more taxa than QA (P > 0.214).
    - Taxa agreement: mean 59%, with 100% agreement at five ponds.
    - Discrepancies due to misidentifications, boundary definitions (outer pond limits), and seasonal changes.
    - Taxa missed by both surveys mostly grasses/sedges/rushes and submerged aquatics; seven taxa missed at more than one site, notably Juncus effusus and Agrostis stolonifera.
    - Pond hydrochemistry correlations with QA data:
      - Soluble reactive phosphorus: r = 0.60
      - Alkalinity: r = 0.95
      - pH: r = 0.84
      - Conductivity: r = 0.98
      - Total oxidised nitrogen: r = 0.47 (not significant); two ponds with large TON differences due to a two-month gap between visits.
    - Overall, field and lab procedures were consistently applied; timing between main and QA sampling impacted TON comparisons.

- Uncertainty, biases, and interpretation
  - All measurements carry inherent environmental uncertainty from spatial, temporal, and inter-surveyor factors.
  - Plant data showed substantial repeatability challenges; RHS judgments contributed to variability.
  - Temporal differences (main vs QA separated by weeks in many cases) complicate disentangling source of error; best practice is to minimize time between main and QA surveys.
  - Although some QA differences are notable, the QA exercise provides a defensible baseline for bias and protocol vulnerability, informing targeted training and protocol refinements.

- Implications for data use and future surveys
  - The QA results support using CS2007 freshwater data with awareness of observed biases, particularly in aquatic plant surveys.
  - Use QA findings to direct training focus (e.g., bryophytes, algae, inconspicuous grasses, precise relocation of survey reaches).
  - Emphasize returning to exact survey stretches and ensuring QA occurs within two weeks of the main survey when possible.
  - QA baseline will inform improvements to field protocols and highlight plant groups requiring greater expertise.
  - Macroinvertebrate QA results to be reported later; overall, QA data help gauge data quality and guide confidence in change detection.

- Conclusions
  - The CS2007 freshwater QA survey provides the first quantified assessment of variability in freshwater data collection and yields actionable insights into data quality.
  - Hydrochemical measurements show strong repeatability; plant surveys (especially streams) exhibit notable variability and potential bias, guiding training and protocol enhancements.
  - The QA exercise establishes a baseline for continuous improvement in future Countryside Surveys and supports more robust interpretation of change in freshwater ecosystems.
