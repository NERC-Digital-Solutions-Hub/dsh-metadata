# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview and scope
- Aims to maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH/NERC, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- These elements are essential for: scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public interest rationale: requests for location data handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access, release levels, and exceptions
- Location data can be used to determine if survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid in which a square sits.
- Precise locations (six-digit grid references): released only if CEH can perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing locations; very exceptional circumstances may permit external access under licence if the requester demonstrates IP-related confidentiality needs at least equal to CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could indirectly identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects, and data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- At licence end, licensees must confirm data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements; a clause prevents attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Decisions on exceptional releases are made by CEH on behalf of NERC.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by an authorized senior representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under applicable Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS partner use, CEH will endeavour to provide reasonable preprocessing support within a reasonable timeframe; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- CS partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be coordinated as part of collaboration or on a paid basis, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for data stewardship
- Establish and enforce licensing controls, secure storage, and access restrictions.
- Maintain an audit trail of licensing decisions and rationale.
- Ensure data minimisation by sharing only four-digit references when possible; escalate to six-digit references only under strict exceptional criteria.
- Monitor licence expiry and enforce destruction and confirmation processes.
- Maintain liaison with CEH for pre-processing needs and to navigate FOI/EIR considerations.
- Communicate the policy to potential applicants and advise consultation with CEH prior to data use.
