# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity; the policy relates only to survey square locations and uses; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Scope and partners: Applies to CS square locations and spatial data within survey squares; current CS partners include CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

- Why locations are confidential:
  - To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners, safeguarding scientific integrity and future permissions for surveying land.
  - Ensures ongoing capability to inform environmental policy; requests for information handled under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- Circumstances and levels of release:
  - Four-digit grid references (approximate location) may be released under licence to identify the CS square’s broader area (10x10 km grid).
  - Six-digit grid references (precise location) are only released in very exceptional circumstances; requests must be processed to avoid CEH involvement if possible, and must justify equal or higher confidentiality protection for IP.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
  - In all cases, releases must not enable locating the exact square or planning visits/compliance checks on landowners.

- Licensing terms and usage restrictions:
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals for a defined project.
  - Licences are finite; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes after the project ends.
  - End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data was secure and has been destroyed.
  - Data must not be shared with third parties in ways that could compromise square locations; no deduction attempts to pinpoint squares.
  - If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - For four-digit releases, terms are similar but do not require the same IP confidentiality level as six-digit releases; there is a specific clause preventing attempts to derive precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with terms signed by authorised representatives.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to support reasonable pre-processing analysis for CS internal use within moderate demand; external requests are handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data; CEH may assist in defining requirements or supporting appropriate use, potentially as collaboration or paid work.

- Practical guidance for users:
  - Consult CEH early to determine feasibility and appropriate process for data access.
  - Expect a governance- and confidentiality-focused pathway, with possible processing by CEH before external handling.
  - Recognize that access to precise location data is tightly controlled to protect sampling integrity and landowner goodwill.

- Public interest and data governance alignment:
  - The policy emphasizes balancing public interest in data utility with protections for survey integrity, landowner privacy, and future survey viability.
  - Aligns with broader data governance practices, including controlled access, transparent decision processes, and commitment to data security.
