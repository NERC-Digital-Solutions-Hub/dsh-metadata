Countryside Survey 2007 Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey

- Aim of the document
  - Provide standardized, auditable methods for monitoring environmental health across headwaters and ponds in the CS2007 framework.
  - Describe sampling design, field procedures, data capture, and quality control to enable longitudinal policy-relevant analysis.

- Scope and context
  - National freshwater survey integrated into Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007).
  - Two linked components:
    - Headwaters: monitoring headwater streams using macroinvertebrate and habitat data plus water chemistry.
    - Ponds: assessing pond condition via mapping, macrophyte surveys, environmental data, and water chemistry.

- Key survey design elements
  - Headwaters
    - Re-survey all 425 squares previously visited in CS2000 for headwater streams.
    - In each square: macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS), River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology, water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity), and 100 m aquatic macrophyte survey centered on macroinvertebrate site.
    - 25 of the 425 squares sample a new headwater site due to stream order considerations.
  - Ponds
    - Identify all ponds in each CS square; define a survey pond per square where possible.
    - Pond assessments include macrophyte survey, pond boundary and drawdown measurements, pond-wide environmental data, and water chemistry (as per CS2007 protocol).

- Data collection and analysis framework
  - Macroinvertebrates
    - Standardised 3-minute active kick-net sampling with 900 μm mesh, proportional habitat sampling, plus 1 minute of manual searching.
    - Specimens stored in 18" x 12" bags with 40% formalin for lab identification; special handling for rare or threatened taxa.
    - Record environmental data for the macroinvertebrate sampling area (width, depth, velocity, substrate, other habitats).
    - Data entered on RIVPACS Sample Area Form; linked to macroinvertebrate results.
  - Hydromorphology and habitat
    - RHS (River Habitat Survey) field protocol (2003 version); 500 m reach for each RHS survey, centered on macroinvertebrate site where possible.
    - Data entered in RAPID (field digital system) to validate on-site; RHS fields cover flow type, pool/run/riffle, bank features, shading, and substrate.
  - Aquatic macrophytes
    - MTR-based aquatic plant survey: 100 m reach, recording presence and percent cover of submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent macrophytes.
    - Species identification to species level where possible; collection of voucher specimens when necessary; specimens handled and labeled for lab confirmation.
    - Data entry via IRIS (field digital data entry system) with on-site validation.
  - Water chemistry
    - On-site conductivity and pH (field meters); filtered samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity using disposable filters; sample bottles labeled with square and site details.
  - Pond-specific data
    - Pond mapping, boundary delineation, sketching, area estimation, drawdown height, proportion of water present, sediment and pond base composition, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, and pond management.
    - Environmental data (surrounding land use, amenity value, public access, and usage) captured on pond forms.
    - Macrophyte and turbidity assessments, plus detailed notes on rare species and specimen handling.

- Field procedures and data capture
  - Sampling duration and sequence
    - Headwaters: fixed 3-minute macroinvertebrate sampling with proportional habitat sampling, plus 1 minute manual search; water chemistry readings collected during sampling sequence.
    - Aquatic macrophytes: 100 m survey length; systematic wading or grapnel for submerged plants; percentage cover estimates for each species.
    - Pond condition: conduct surveys before disturbing sediments; record plant assemblages within the pond boundary; measure drawdown and water depth at multiple transects where feasible.
  - Equipment and safety
    - Comprehensive field equipment lists for safety, sampling, and transport, including PPE, nets, meters, sampling bottles, fixatives, tracing and labeling materials, and transport packaging (TREM card).
    - Specific health and safety guidance for field sampling in streams and ponds, including risk assessments and access considerations.
  - Data validation and QA
    - On-site data validation in RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (aquatic plants) to catch omissions and inconsistencies.
    - Cross-team QA: standardized training, regular team rotations, and independent audits of about 7% of headwater sites.
  - Data management and transport
    - Macroinvertebrate and plant specimens transported to CEH Dorset in batches (6–8 pots per box; TREM card on transport box).
    - Monthly dispatch schedule; lab processing coordinated with Pond Conservation for plant specimens and CEH Dorset for macroinvertebrate samples.
    - Documentation and labeling requirements emphasized for sample integrity and traceability.

- Specific methodological details (highlights)
  - Headwaters sampling framework
    - 425 squares from CS2000; 500 m headwater reach; 100 m aquatic plant survey within reach.
    - Macroinvertebrates sampled with RIVPACS-compatible methods; 60% of families captured on average per three-minute kick sample.
    - Environmental data collected at modal site conditions; propagates into RIVPACS environmental variables.
  - RHS data capture and modernization
    - RHS data entered via RAPID on Tablet PC; 17 sections across four pages; built-in data validation with stepwise error correction.
    - Spot-checks, geometry, and habitat feature data captured with standardized drop-downs to ensure consistency.
  - Macrophyte survey protocol
    - MTR-based 100 m survey with systematic wading, grapnel use, and precise cover scoring (1–9 scale) for each species.
    - Species list includes a comprehensive set of wetland taxa; identify rare species and collect voucher samples when appropriate.
    - IRIS handles plant data with two-page forms; specimen submission guidelines included.
  - Pond condition survey protocol
    - Mapping of pond boundaries, boundary delineation, sketching, and measurement of pond area.
    - Turbidity estimation, water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity), and sediment/pond base composition assessment.
    - Documentation of inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, pond management, land-use context, and amenity value.
    - Macrophyte survey within pond boundary; taxonomy and identification guidance; specimen submission to confirm difficult taxa.
  - Documentation and reporting tools
    - Standard field sheets (RIVPACS environmental form, pond condition sheets, MTR/macrophyte forms) and digital data entry interfaces (RAPID, IRIS) to streamline data capture and reduce transcription errors.
    - Guidance on sketch maps, site relocation features, and photographic documentation for future re-location.

- Endnotes and implementation notes
  - Pond condition surveys integrate with pond mapping to ensure consistent inclusion of ponds across CS squares.
  - Coverage and comparability across years are preserved through standardized RHS (2003 version) and MTR/macrophyte methodologies, with compatibility to newer RHS protocols.
  - The overall approach emphasizes data value and accessibility, encouraging data integration with other datasets and enabling broader data reuse.

- Outputs and intended use
  - Provides standardized, QA-focused datasets for environmental health and policy performance monitoring over time.
  - Facilitates cross-year comparison of headwater and pond condition, informing conservation planning and environmental assessments at national scales.
