# Countryside Survey 2007

## Overview
- Large-scale field program to inventory freshwater and pond environments across GB, including headwater streams and ponds.
- Data collected span macroinvertebrate communities (RIVPACS), River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology, aquatic macrophytes (MTR), water chemistry, and pond condition.
- Data governance focus for Data Stewards: standardized data capture, metadata, quality assurance, storage, and dissemination to relevant bodies (CEH, Pond Conservation).

## Data collection framework

### Headwaters (CS2007)
- All 425 squares with CS2000 freshwater module re-surveyed for headwater streams.
- Elements re-surveyed in each square:
  - Macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS method)
  - RIVPACS environmental variables
  - Hydromorphological status (River Habitat Survey, RHS)
  - Physical characteristics of the watercourse
  - Water chemistry (indicative sample: pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity)
- Pond elements (in randomly selected ponds within 629 CS2007 squares containing ponds):
  - Aquatic plant community
  - Physical characteristics of the waterbody
  - Water chemistry
- Sampling strategy emphasizes consistent, comparable sites with clear relocation features and robust GIS/grid references.

### Pond Condition Survey (CS2007)
- Mapping phase by mappers: identify all ponds in the square and record basic attributes; define the survey pond.
- Survey steps include: photographing the pond, delineating the outer boundary, sketching the pond, estimating area, measuring drawdown height, estimating water presence, and sediment/pond-base assessment.
- Data collection covers:
  - Water quality (pH, conductivity; SRP, TON, alkalinity from filtered samples)
  - Environmental survey (amenity use, land use around pond)
  - Macrophyte survey (species presence/abundance; cover by submerged, floating-leaved, emergent; overhanging trees)
  - Documentation of inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, pond management, livestock and waterbird usage
  - Surrounding land use in two zones (0-5 m and 0-100 m)
  - Amenity value: view, public access, and amenity use
- Data handling includes field sheets, site photos, sketch maps, and subsequent submission to Pond Conservation.

## Data capture and management systems

- Macroinvertebrate sampling: RIVPACS Sample Area Form
  - Records sampling site, date, GPS/NGR, sample time, methodology (Kick/Sweep, Sweep), proportional habitat sampling, and site characteristics.
  - Captures water width, depth, velocity, substrate, and vegetation data; requires on-site photography and labeling; formalin preservation details included.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS) in the field
  - Data entered into RAPID (field digital data entry system).
  - 17 sections across 4 pages; sections include field survey details, spot-checks, physical attributes, land-use, bank/top vegetation, channel features, and dimensions.
  - On-site data validation with Check Data function; RHS manual linked within RAPID; square selection via CS data.

- Aquatic plants (MTR) data capture
  - IRIS: field digital data entry system for macrophyte surveys.
  - Two-page form: general survey info and plant cover data (with species lists by major groups); physical site data on Page 2.
  - Species listed with abundance categories; specimens for uncertain IDs can be sent for expert confirmation; no plants recorded deeper in the field are omitted.
  - Validation on-site via “Check Data” before leaving.

- Pond macrophyte survey data
  - Detailed pond condition forms (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets) including water quality, environmental survey, and macrophyte data.
  - Macrophyte survey cross-referenced with 100 m MTR length; identification follows standard floras; rare species flagged for special handling.

- Field survey checklists and QA
  - Field survey check-list ensures all tasks completed before leaving the site.
  - Quality control: EA certificate holders perform RHS macroinvertebrate sampling; regular team rotation; ~7% headwater site audits; on-site field staff training and accreditation.

## Data labeling, transport, and storage

- Sample labeling and documentation
  - All samples labeled with CS square, pond/square code, date, and surveyor; sample type and other metadata recorded on forms.
  - Macroinvertebrate and plant specimens stored in labeled containers with PVC-taped lids; TREM transport cards used for hazardous materials (formaldehyde).

- Transport and storage
  - Macroinvertebrate samples stored in CEH-approved storage boxes; couriered to CEH Dorset in batches (typically 6-8 pots per box).
  - Plant specimens prepared, bagged, labeled; sent to CEH Dorset for confirmation.
  - Samples stored at CEH bases until shipment; monthly dispatch cycles arranged.

- Data integration and dissemination
  - Data from field forms are uploaded into centralized data systems (RAPID for RHS; IRIS for macrophytes; RIVPACS forms for invertebrates).
  - Field data are validated on-site; data are subsequently consolidated and shared with Pond Conservation and other collaborators.

## Practical considerations and challenges

- Ensuring alignment between user needs and standardized data schemas; handling multiple systems and formats (RIVPACS, RHS/RAPID, MTR/IRIS).
- Coordinating data collection across large geographic scales with consistent methodologies.
- Safety and risk management in fieldwork (headwaters and ponds); two-person teams; safety checklists.
- Managing large datasets and ensuring timely processing and archival.
