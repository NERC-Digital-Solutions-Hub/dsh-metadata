# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

## Purpose and scope
- Evaluate QA aspects of the Countryside Survey 2007 freshwater module (CS2007) to ensure high-quality data on small streams and ponds across Great Britain.
- Verify that field surveyors are trained and skilled; ensure laboratory analyses meet standards; quantify uncertainty in field data.
- Provide a baseline QA assessment to inform future surveys, training, and protocol refinement; highlight data quality issues impacting change detection and policy monitoring.

## QA design and methods
- Field re-sampling: random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares from CS2007; re-surveyed streams in all 31 squares and ponds in 18 squares (8% stream re-survey, 7% pond re-survey).
- Re-locating survey sites: used photographs, grid references, map annotations; IRIS on Tablet PC for aquatic plants; RAPID on Tablet PC for RHS data.
- Components assessed:
  - Aquatic plants (streams): 30 of 31 QA streams re-surveyed; 100 m stretch around original invert sampling location.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS): 500 m reach surveyed; 10 transects; assessment of bank/vegetation features; HQA index calculated.
  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates: 30 of 31 QA streams re-surveyed; samples taken at same locations; processing by CEH River Communities Group (results pending in CS Freshwaters Report, late 2009).
  - Hydrochemistry: 30 streams measured for phosphate, nitrogen, alkalinity; on-site pH and conductivity recorded.
  - Wetland plants (ponds): 18 ponds re-surveyed; 16 ponds had plant taxa data (pond QA vs main CS2007).
- Quality measures:
  - Taxonomic standardisation and removal of terrestrial species for aquatic plants.
  - Comparisons focused on taxa lists, community indices (e.g., MTR for plants), number of bridges/culverts, HQA scores, and ranked hydrochemical parameters.

## Key findings by component

- Aquatic plants (streams)
  - Taxa richness: main CS2007 survey tended to record fewer taxa than QA (main=1.9 fewer taxa on average; significant bias).
  - Agreement: mean % taxon agreement between CS2007 and CS2007QA was 31%; only 100% agreement when only a single species was present.
  - Error drivers: rare taxa (most errors, >80%, had <1% cover); spatial/temporal differences; misidentifications; late season differences; difficulty defining 100 m survey reach.
  - Derived metrics: QA surveys tended to score higher MTR by about 5.6 (not statistically significant) but with substantial variability.
  - Implication: plant surveys are difficult to replicate; however, CS2007 data can proceed for change analysis with awareness of bias; QA provides a baseline to target training.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - Bridge/culvert counts: 70% of sites showed no difference; small differences at a minority of sites due to slight relocations.
  - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA): QA scores consistently differed from main CS scores; main survey tended to score higher by ~6.9 units on average.
  - Key issue: subjective classification of bank-face and bank-top vegetation (e.g., upland moorland vegetation classified differently between surveys), driving HQA variability.
  - Implication: RHS data require cautious interpretation; no CS2000 QA data means bias is presumed similar for CS2000; proceed with analysis but mindful of quality issues.

- Hydrochemistry
  - Rank correlations between main and QA values were strong across most parameters:
    - Soluble reactive phosphorus: r = 0.89
    - Total oxidised nitrogen: r = 0.79
    - Alkalinity: r = 0.97
    - pH: r = 0.74
    - Conductivity: r = 0.97
  - Conclusion: field and laboratory procedures were consistently applied; results are reliable for ranking and comparison.

- Wetland plants (ponds)
  - Taxa richness: main vs QA showed no significant bias; main survey found 0.6 more taxa on average, not statistically significant.
  - Agreement: mean taxa agreement 59%; 100% agreement at five ponds.
  - Discrepancies: misidentifications and boundary definitions; seasonal differences; 36 taxa missed across surveys (mostly grass/sedge/rush and small submerged taxa); seven taxa missed at more than one site (notably Juncus effusus and Agrostis stolonifera).
  - TON differences: two ponds showed substantial TON differences between main and QA; timing gap (two months) highlighted as a factor.
  - Implication: pond plant surveys are variable; QA establishes baseline and informs training focused on grass-like and inconspicuous species.

## Discussion and interpretation
- Inherent uncertainty in environmental measurements; QA provides a first estimate of variability in freshwater data to improve change detection, training, and protocols.
- Variation sources include spatial (location accuracy), temporal (seasonal/ disturbance effects), and inter-surveyor competence; isolating components is difficult.
- Timing: many QA/main surveys occurred weeks apart, which complicates attribution of differences to methodology vs natural change.
- Subjective elements (e.g., RHS vegetation classification) contribute to score differences, particularly in upland/moorland contexts.
- Despite limitations, CS2007 QA data offer a defensible baseline for future surveys and identify focus areas for training and protocol refinement.

## Implications for monitoring and data quality
- The QA exercise highlights where data quality can influence monitoring outcomes:
  - Aquatic plant surveys require improved identification of bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grass-like species; need consistent relocation to previous survey stretches.
  - RHS requires clearer guidance for vegetation classifications and strategies to minimize subjective variation.
  - Temporal proximity between QA and main surveys is crucial to minimize temporal noise.
- The QA dataset will guide training priorities, focusing on repeatability and accuracy of key features, and will inform refinements to field protocols.
- The CS2007 freshwater QA exercise sets a baseline against which future CS freshwater data can be compared, improving confidence in detected changes.

## Recommendations and next steps
- Training enhancements:
  - Improve identification skills for aquatic bryophytes and algae; increase awareness of bryophytes, algae, and subtle grass-like taxa.
  - Emphasize returning to exact survey stretches and controlling boundaries of survey areas.
  - Strengthen RHS training around interpretation of bank vegetation structure to reduce subjectivity.
- Operational practices:
  - Conduct QA within two weeks of the main survey at the same site where possible.
  - Focus QA efforts on components with higher misclassification risk (plant communities, RHS habitat classification).
- Data and reporting:
  - Continue macroinvertebrate QA analyses and integrate results into the Freshwaters Report (late 2009).
  - Use QA findings to refine field protocols and monitoring guidelines for subsequent CS surveys.
- Data access and transparency:
  - Maintain clear documentation of QA results and make QA data available to stakeholders to support scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
