# Headwaters

- National Countryside Survey 2007 focus on headwater streams and ponds to assess biological condition and habitat quality.
- Integrated data collection across multiple streams: macroinvertebrates, water chemistry, hydromorphology, and aquatic macrophytes; includes pond condition assessments in mapped squares.

## Key data streams and data products

- Macroinvertebrate sampling
  - Uses RIVPACS biosassessment framework; include macroinvertebrate community, environmental data, RHS hydromorphology, and water chemistry.
  - Sampling area: 5–15 m focus zone per site; standardized three-minute kick sample plus one minute of manual search.
  - Output forms: RIVPACS Sample Area Form; environmental data capture integrated with RIVPACS data.
- Water chemistry
  - Measures conductivity, pH in field; samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity via on-site filtration (0.45 µm) and 50 ml bottles; lab analysis coordination.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - Hydromorphological assessment over a 500 m stretch centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site.
  - Data captured with RAPID field digital system; on-site validation and data quality checks.
- Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR)
  - 100 m reach around macroinvertebrate site; species presence and percent cover (submerged, floating-leaved, emergent); shading by overhanging vegetation.
  - Data captured with IRIS field system; includes specimen handling and lab confirmation guidelines.
- Pond condition survey (CS2007)
  - When ponds are identified in squares, condition is assessed for a survey pond including macrophyte survey, environmental characteristics, water chemistry, and pond mapping data.
  - Recording sheets cover pond area, drawdown height, sediment/pond base, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, land use, amenity value, and management practices.
- Pond mapping and field notes
  - Ponds mapped per square; outer pond boundary defined by winter water level; field sketch maps created to assist relocation.
  - Samples and specimens transported to CEH Dorset; detailed labeling and transport procedures (TREM card).

## Study design and sampling framework

- CS2007 Headwaters: re-survey all 425 CS2000 squares for headwater macroinvertebrate, RHS, water chemistry, and plant community data; 25 squares will include a new headwater sampling site due to stream order considerations.
- Headwater sampling layout
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling site length defined to maximize RHS data and to align with standard RHS site locations when possible.
  - 500 m RHS transect centered on macroinvertebrate site; RHS protocols updated to 2003 Environment Agency version; data entered via RAPID.
  - Aquatic plant survey (MTR) spans 100 m around macroinvertebrate point; plants identified to species where possible; lab confirmation for difficult taxa.
- Pond condition survey
  - Ponds within squares identified and mapped; one survey pond per square with comprehensive macrophyte, environmental, and water quality assessments; boundary and drawdown measurements documented.

## Data collection protocols and workflows

- On-site sampling procedures
  - Macroinvertebrates: standardized three-minute kick sample plus one minute of manual searching; habitats sampled proportionally; net handling and cleaning procedures defined; avoidance of sampling during spates.
  - Water chemistry: simultaneous collection for pH/conductivity and filtered SRP/TON/alkalinity samples; use of 1 L bottles and 50 ml filtrate bottles; explicit filtration and labeling steps.
  - RHS data: detailed spot-check observations (10 spot-checks plus substrate and vegetation overall), 500 m sweep, and habitat mapping; safety checks and access considerations documented.
  - Macrophyte survey: 100 m wading/walking survey; species presence and percent cover estimated; herbarium/Voucher specimen guidance provided; sampling techniques for submerged and emergent species.
- Pond condition survey workflow
  - Map pond boundary, draw outline, estimate area, and determine drawdown height; turbidity assessment; water chemistry sampling; environmental survey including land use and amenity aspects.
  - Macrophyte survey within pond boundary; identify and quantify submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species; specimen collection and lab confirmation guidelines included.
- Field safety and data integrity
  - Health and safety checks for sampling in streams and ponds; two-person field teams; documentation of risks and emergency procedures.
  - On-site data validation using RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (plant surveys) to catch missing data and inconsistencies before leaving site; mandatory data checks and completion confirmations.

## Data capture, validation, and QA

- Digital data capture
  - RHS: RAPID field data entry system on Tablet PC; 17 sections across 4 pages with drop-down menus to minimize entry errors; on-site data validation before exiting.
  - Macrophyte: IRIS data entry system; two-page form; drop-down lists; on-site validation with "Check Data" function; support for uploading plant specimens and specimen IDs.
- Quality assurance
  - Certification: RHS surveyors hold Environment Agency certificate; macroinvertebrate sampling and MTR plant surveying trained/accredited.
  - Regular team rotation to maintain consistency; annual audits of headwater sites (approximately 7%).
  - Field survey checklist ensures all tasks are completed; sampling consistency across teams.
- Data integration and accessibility
  - Data from different streams integrated in national datasets (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR, pond data); on-site validation reduces downstream data gaps.
  - Data and specimen dispatch to CEH Dorset; standardized labeling and transport procedures; monthly shipments.

## Data governance, storage, and transport

- Sample labeling and storage
  - Macroinvertebrate pots stored in labeled containers with transport documentation (TREM cards) for hazardous fixatives (e.g., formaldehyde).
  - Plant specimens labeled with CS square and pond/survey identifiers; pressed or preserved (pickle) using specified methods.
- Transport and archival
  - Samples mailed in batches (6–8 pots per box) to CEH Dorset; notify CEH staff of shipment; CEH handles processing and cataloging.
  - Field sheets and accompanying notes compiled and dispatched to Pond Conservation; photos, CDs, or emails used to convey data.
- Documentation and references
  - Detailed reference materials linked to established protocols (Environment Agency RHS, Murray-Bligh sampling, Holmes et al. 1999 MTR, Stewart 2004 macrophyte recommendations, etc.).

## Pond condition survey specifics

- Overview and scope
  - Ponds defined as standing water bodies 25 m2 to 2 ha; mapping performed to identify survey ponds within each square.
  - Survey pond undergoes macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry assessments; full pond boundary mapped and drawn.
