# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protects sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Maintains scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
- Confidentiality supports the public-interest rationale and the continued ability to inform policy.

## When and how location data can be released
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references released under licence to indicate in which 10x10 km grid square a survey square lies.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, and only after CEH conducts required pre-processing; external licence may be granted if the requester proves their data/products require equivalent or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) are treated with the same exceptional-release conditions as six-digit location data.

## Conditions of release (licence terms)
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- End of licence period: written confirmation that data remained secure and was destroyed.
- No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality; no use to plan visits or monitor individual landowners.
- For six-digit releases (and spatial data with high confidentiality), evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP may be required.
- Four-digit releases impose less stringent IP/confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
- Aimed to prevent attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licenses; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
- CEH provides an annual report on access applications and decision grounds to CS partners.
- CEH may provide pre-processing support for internal CS partner use within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by the policy; CEH involvement may be direct or advisory and is negotiable per case.
