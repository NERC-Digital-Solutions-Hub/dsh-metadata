# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

## Purpose and Scope
- Provides baseline QA findings for the CS2007 freshwater component to quantify uncertainty in field data and support confidence in derived results.
- Ensures high standards in training, accreditation, and laboratory procedures to underpin data quality and comparability over time.
- Covers multiple data streams: aquatic plants (streams and ponds), River Habitat Survey (RHS), aquatic macroinvertebrates, and hydrochemistry.

## Methods
- Field QA design: random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares; re-sampling of streams (8% effort) and ponds (7% effort).
- Re-surveyed at the same locations and stretches as CS2007:
  - Aquatic plants: 30/31 streams re-surveyed; 100 m survey stretch re-located with photos, grid refs, and map annotations; data entered via IRIS Tablet PC.
  - RHS: 500 m survey stretch re-located using same visual references; data recorded with RAPID on Tablet PC.
  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates: 30/31 streams re-sampled; standard macroinvertebrate protocols used; samples processed by CEH River Communities Group.
  - Hydrochemistry: 30/31 streams sampled for phosphate, nitrogen, alkalinity; on-site pH and conductivity measured.
  - Ponds: 18 re-surveyed for aquatic plants; 15 ponds sampled for hydrochemistry.
- Data quality and validation:
  - Taxonomic standardisation and removal of terrestrial taxa in plant data.
  - Comparison of main CS2007 survey vs QA survey to assess concordance and bias.
  - Discussion of temporal, spatial, and inter-surveyor factors contributing to variability.

## Findings by Component

### Aquatic Plants (Streams)
- Taxa richness: main CS2007 survey tended to find fewer taxa than QA (approximately 1.9 taxa fewer on average).
- Agreement: mean agreement between CS2007 and QA taxa lists was about 31%; 100% agreement only when a single species was found in both surveys.
- Common sources of error: rare taxa misidentification or missed searches; differences in the exact 100 m survey reach; seasonal and vegetation changes; timing between surveys.
- Impact on indices: QA surveys tended to score higher in MTR values by about 5.6 points on average, though not statistically significant.
- Implication: high repeatability challenges for aquatic plant surveys; CS2007 data can proceed for change analysis with awareness of plant-identification and search thoroughness issues.

### River Habitat Survey (RHS)
- Bridge/culvert counts: 70% of sites showed no difference; some sites differed by ±1 or ±2 due to minor stretch relocation.
- Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA): QA scores typically differed from CS scores; QA tended to be lower by about 6.9 units on average.
- Causes of disparity: subjective classifications of bankface/top vegetation (notably moorland with Molinia/heather); upland areas showed greatest disparity.
- Data usability: no CS2000 QA data; assume similar bias for CS2000 and CS2007; CS2007 RHS data considered usable with caveats.

### Hydrochemistry
- Rank correlations between main CS2007 and QA for/ total oxidised nitrogen, phosphorus, alkalinity, pH, and conductivity were strong (e.g., Alkalinity r = 0.97; Conductivity r = 0.97; P = <0.001 for most).
- TON showed some discrepancy (r = 0.79 overall, but two ponds with substantial TON differences due to a two-month gap between surveys).
- Conclusion: field and lab procedures are consistently applied; results remain reliable when QA and main surveys are temporally proximate.

### Wetland Plants (Ponds)
- Taxa counts: no significant bias; main survey found 0.6 more taxa on average than QA (not statistically significant).
- Agreement: mean plant taxa agreement about 59%; 100% agreement at five ponds.
- Discrepancies: mostly misidentifications or boundary definitions; seasonal differences and detection of submerged taxa can affect results.
- Implication: pond plant surveys show moderate repeatability; QA provides baseline for pond surveys and highlights difficult taxa (grass-like and submerged species).

### Other Notes
- Overall uncertainty: environmental measurements are inherently variable; QA helps quantify inter-surveyor competence and protocol vulnerability.
- Temporal and spatial factors: QA indicates challenge in isolating origin of error; keeping QA and main surveys as close in time as possible reduces temporal error.

## Data Quality, Uncertainty, and Governance Implications
- QA establishes a baseline for future CS freshwater data quality and supports targeted training in identified weak areas (e.g., bryophytes, algae, grass-like taxa; precise relocation to previous survey stretches).
- Documentation requirements:
  - Metadata on survey dates, locations, relocation methods, and survey stretches to support traceability and reproducibility.
  - Clear notes on observed biases and uncertainties to inform interpretation of change estimates.
- Data versioning and provenance: QA results should be maintained alongside main CS data to enable benchmarking and confidence assessments over time.
- Timeliness: minimize temporal gaps between main and QA surveys to improve interpretability of QA results.

## Recommendations for Practice
- Training focus:
  - Improved identification of aquatic bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grass-like species.
  - Emphasis on returning exactly to previous survey stretches to reduce spatial error.
  - Strengthen RHS training for consistent interpretation of bank vegetation categories.
- Field protocols:
  - Conduct QA and main surveys within two weeks when possible to reduce temporal variability.
  - Consider standardized criteria for boundary definitions of survey plots (e.g., pond boundaries, stream reach ends).
- Data handling:
  - Maintain comprehensive QA metadata for all datasets (surveyor IDs, timing, relocation references, equipment used).
  - Include QA bias notes in data products to aid downstream data users in interpretation.
- Future work:
  - Complete macroinvertebrate QA analysis and report macroinvertebrate QA results in the Freshwater Technical Report (due late 2009).
  - Use QA findings to refine field protocols and guide future training and quality controls.

## Future Work and Availability
- The Freshwater Technical Report (late 2009) will provide detailed macroinvertebrate QA results.
- QA results serve as a baseline to inform improvements in field protocols and training in subsequent Countryside Surveys.
