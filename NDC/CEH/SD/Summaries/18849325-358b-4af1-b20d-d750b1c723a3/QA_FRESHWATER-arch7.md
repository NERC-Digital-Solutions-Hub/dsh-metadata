# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Purpose: quantify uncertainty in CS2007 freshwater data (streams and ponds) to support confidence in results and inform improvements in field protocols, training, and data handling.
- Scope: QA on a random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares across Great Britain; comparison between main CS2007 surveyors and an experienced CEH biologist.

## QA approach and field methods

- Re-sampling at 31 squares:
  - Streams: re-surveyed in all 31 squares (8% effort).
  - Ponds: re-surveyed in 18 of the 31 squares (7% effort).
- Data collection tools:
  - Aquatic plants and environmental data recorded with tablet-based IRIS/RAPID systems.
  - Relocation of survey reaches (100 m for plants; 500 m RHS stretch) using photographs, grid ref, and maps.
- Components evaluated:
  - Aquatic plants (streams and ponds)
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates (streams; results to be reported later)
  - Hydrochemistry (on-site pH, conductivity) and laboratory analyses (phosphate, nitrogen, alkalinity)
- Temporal considerations:
  - QA surveys conducted after main surveys; timing differences noted and discussed as a source of temporal error.

## Key findings by component

- Aquatic plants (streams)
  - Taxon counts: QA generally found more taxa than the main survey (approx. 1.9 taxa higher on average).
  - Agreement: mean site-level agreement around 31% (only 100% agreement at sites with a single species).
  - Reasons for discrepancies: misidentifications, incomplete searches, slight differences in exact 100 m reach location, seasonal changes, vegetation disturbance between surveys.
  - Implications for indices: QA tended to produce higher MTR scores, but differences were not statistically conclusive; repeatability challenges remain high.
  - Overall: significant difficulty in obtaining highly repeatable stream aquatic plant data; highlights need for improved bryophyte/algae identification and training, precise relocation, and timing.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - Bridges/culverts counts: 70% of sites showed no difference; most discrepancies were ±1.
  - HQA scores: QA generally differed from main CS scores, with an average bias where main surveys reported higher scores; upland/moorland classifications (e.g., “Simple” vs “Uniform”) contributed to differences.
  - Source of variability: subjective judgments on bank/vegetation structure; some ambiguity in vegetation classification within the RHS manual.
  - Implications: RHS data show variability influenced by surveyor decision-making; use of RHS as a composite HQA index is sensitive to interpretive differences.

- Hydrochemistry (streams)
  - Rank correlations between main and QA: high for all five parameters (e.g., alkalinity r=0.97; conductivity r=0.97; SRP r=0.89; TON r=0.79; pH r=0.74).
  - Conclusion: field and lab procedures for hydrochemistry were consistently applied; results are reliable for ranking across sites.

- Wetland plants (ponds)
  - Taxon counts: no significant bias overall; main survey found slightly more taxa on average (0.6 taxa).
  - Agreement: mean site-level agreement around 59%; 100% agreement at five ponds.
  - Discrepancies: misidentifications, boundary definitions (outer pond edge), and seasonal variation; common misses included grasses and rushes.
  - Implications: first pond-wide plant data collection; provides a baseline for future pond plant surveys and training focus on grass-like taxa.

- Hydrochemistry (ponds)
  - Rank correlations: strong for four of five parameters; TON showed weaker correspondence, especially with two ponds exhibiting substantial TON differences due to a two-month gap between visits.
  - Takeaway: keep QA and main surveys as close in time as possible to minimize temporal mismatch; overall procedures are sound.

## Discussion and implications for GIS/data use

- Uncertainty is inherent in environmental measurements; QA provides baseline variance to improve detection of change and target training.
- Main sources of error:
  - Spatial: accurately locating the prior survey stretch and defining survey boundaries.
  - Temporal: ecological changes between surveys; schedule gaps between QA and main surveys weaken interpretation, especially for plant data.
  - Inter-surveyor competence: variation in thoroughness and taxonomic identification, particularly for cryptic or rare taxa.
- Overall usefulness of QA:
  - Identifies aspects of field protocols most vulnerable to misinterpretation or non-repeatability.
  - Informs targeted training priorities (e.g., bryophytes, algae, grasses/rushes; precise relocation; rapid QA after main survey).
  - Establishes a baseline to compare future freshwater surveys and to refine QA protocols.
- Specific recommendations:
  - Conduct QA work within two weeks of the main survey at the same site where feasible.
  - Enhance training for identification of bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grass-like species.
  - Emphasize exact return to previously surveyed stretches and boundaries.
  - Use QA insights to refine field protocols and prioritize efforts for more repeatable data collection.

## Conclusions and next steps

- The CS2007 freshwater QA survey provides a critical baseline for understanding measurement uncertainty in streams and ponds.
- While hydrochemistry shows strong repeatability, plant-based metrics (especially stream aquatic plants) and certain RHS judgments exhibit notable inter-surveyor variability.
- The QA findings will guide improvements in training, field protocols, and data quality controls for subsequent Countryside Surveys, and will inform how GIS-based data products should communicate uncertainty and provenance. The Freshwater Technical Report with macroinvertebrate QA results is to follow.
