# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and purpose
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive study of a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scotland.
  - Aimed to provide a broad context for groups’ detailed studies and facilitate year-to-year comparisons.
  - Baseline site description and experimental design documented in a November 1998 Baseline Data Survey.
  - Two management disruptions in 2001: Foot and Mouth restrictions (Feb–May 2001) and a change of site officer; a biocide application in May was missed, other management activities largely continued.

- Data types and measurements
  - Automatic Weather Station data (2001): headline measures including total rainfall, solar radiation, average air/soil temperatures, and soil moisture at multiple depths.
  - Above-ground biomass (1999–2001): annual and monthly biomass estimates from 0.5 m2 quadrats per sub-plot; biomass weighed after drying; values log-transformed for analyses.
  - Soil pH (upper 5 cm): pH changes over time, notably shows lime- and nitrogen-related increases.
  - Botanical composition (July 2001): Point Quadrat surveys across plots to identify species hits; 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in improved plots; DFA/PCA used to explore community shifts.
  - Site activity and data collection: detailed schedules for data collection and management activities (Tables 1–3; Appendix 1).

- Experimental design and treatments
  - Treatments across plots include: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide.
  - Across years, observed treatment hierarchies in biomass; 2001 differences partly influenced by methodological changes (switch from manual mowing to mechanical shears) and staff changes.

- Key results (2001 and overall trends)
  - Weather (2001): near-average rainfall after very wet prior year; modest temperature changes; soil moisture slightly higher than in some prior years.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Consistent treatment hierarchy; peak biomass in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass increased substantially over 2000, likely due to personnel change and shift to mechanical mowing.
    - Nitrogen and Lime (N &/or L) promoted higher biomass; combined N & Lime often most effective.
    - ANOVA findings indicate significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
  - Soil pH
    - Lime addition raised pH; October 2001: 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots; nitrogen alone also raised pH but less strongly; controls unchanged since 1998 baseline.
  - Botanical composition (July 2001)
    - 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in improved plots; overall density (hits) higher in 2001 than 2000.
    - Species shifts with treatments: Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments; Festuca species increased; improved plots enriched with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis; poorer pastures associated with Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta in controls.
    - PCA shows clear separation of improved vs unimproved plots; biomass correlates positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while some species decline as biomass rises.
    - Relative litter increased in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
  - Biomass and species relationships
    - Biomass positively correlated with abundance of certain grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis); negative or inverse relationships for some herbs and bryophyte-associated species as biomass increases.
    - Relationship between biomass and species composition supports the interpretation that nutrient enrichment shifts communities toward more productive, improved pastures.

- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site (e.g., Columns E and F showing higher acidity in 2000 and 2001 in certain columns).
  - Biomass variation: central plots tended to have higher cumulative biomass; some outliers with very low biomass across treatments.
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences between blocks in biomass.

- Data quality, processing, and governance considerations for data stewards
  - Data provenance and metadata
    - Multiple data streams (weather, biomass, soil pH, botanical surveys) collected on a defined schedule with explicit measurement methods.
    - Documentation includes measurement dates, sub-plot and plot-level structures, and treatment codes.
  - Consistency and comparability
    - Biomass data were normalized (year-to-year comparisons) against the Control 1 (C1) to account for methodological changes (e.g., mowing method).
    - Observational consistency checked for botanical surveys: two surveyors had no significant inter-observer difference (NS, p = 0.18).
  - Data integrity and caveats
    - 2001 management disruption (FMD restrictions) and staff change may influence data consistency; some activities (first biocide application) were missed.
    - Transition from manual cutting to mechanical shears likely inflated 2001 biomass readings; normalization against C1 helps mitigate but caution is needed when comparing across years.
  - Data formats and analysis
    - Use of Genstat 5 for ANOVA and PCA; biomass data log-transformed for analyses; relationships explored via scatter plots and PCA loadings.
  - Documentation and accessibility
    - Tables and figures provide context for cross-project data integration; Appendix 1 offers annual biomass values per plot.
    - Weather data shared with the data manager; site activity schedules and methodological notes available for reproducibility.

- Implications for data reuse and governance
  - The dataset supports understanding how nutrient additions and liming influence biomass productivity and plant community composition under field-scale management.
  - Spatial heterogeneity and pH-biomass relationships should inform spatial analyses and meta-analyses across similar field experiments.
  - Clear documentation of measurement methods, treatment codes, and data processing steps enables reliable data integration with other components of the Sourhope project and related datasets.
