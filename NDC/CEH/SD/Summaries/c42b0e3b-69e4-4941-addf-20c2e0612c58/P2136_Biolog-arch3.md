# Substrate utilisation profiles and moisture content data from soil sampled in a   upland   grassland   experiment   at   Sourhope,   Scotland   [NERC   Soil   Biodiversity Programme] - Supporting Information

- Purpose and context
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (started 1999) focused on understanding soil biota diversity and functional roles in key ecological processes.
  - Aimed to complement studies of aboveground productivity, species composition, and diversity with in-depth soil microbial and faunal analyses.

- Study site and sampling design
  - Location: Sourhope experimental field site, Scottish Borders, UK (grid NT854196).
  - Environment: Temperate upland grassland, shallow organic-rich brown forest soil on glacial till; typical unimproved grazed pasture with dominant Agrostis capillaris.
  - Sampling scheme: 
    - Short-term: three samples over 7 days (8, 10, 14 July 1999).
    - Longer-term: single samples on 5 Oct 1999, 3 Apr 2000, and 30 Aug 2000.
    - For each date: three replicate cores (2.5 cm diameter) to ~20 cm depth; cores separated into 0–5 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–15 cm, and 15–20 cm horizons.
    - Sample handling: 1 g soil for dry weight; remainder stored at -70°C prior to analysis.

- Methods: BIOLOG-GN substrate utilisation and moisture measurement
  - BIOLOG-GN analysis: 
    - 9 mL of 0.5% soil suspension prepared, washed, and inoculated into 96-well BIOLOG-GN plates.
    - Plates incubated at 18°C until colour change ceased; scorepresence/absence of colour development as substrate utilisation.
  - Moisture measurement:
    - Percentage moisture determined as the mean of three replicate cores by oven-drying at 105°C for 24 hours.

- Data products and structure
  - BIOLOG data file: P2136_Biolog_Utilisation.csv
    - Fields: SAMPLING_DATE, MAX_DEPTH, BIOLOG_CELL, SUBSTRATE, SUBSTRATE_TYPE, UTILISATION (1 = utilisation, 0 = no utilisation)
  - Soil moisture data file: P2136_Soil_Moisture.csv
    - Fields: SAMPLING_DATE, MAX_DEPTH, PERCENTAGE_MOISTURE
  - Sampling and substrate details emphasize depth- and time-specific bacterial community activity and moisture context.

- Data governance, quality, and liability
  - Data are subject to quality assurance procedures.
  - NERC cannot warrant the accuracy of the data or fitness for a specific use.
  - The provision of data carries no liability for loss, damage, or other occurrences arising from their use, and NERC cannot be held accountable for such outcomes.
  - Data and accompanying metadata are available with references to supporting literature and a field data handbook for additional guidance.
