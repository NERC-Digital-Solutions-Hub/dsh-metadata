RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Large-scale field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to provide context for detailed studies via broad monitoring across multiple measurements (site management, biomass, soil pH, botanical composition, weather).
  - Full site description and experimental design are in Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998).
  - Site management in 2001 was affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change of Officer in Charge.

- Key management and data context
  - Government FMD restrictions limited site access Feb–May 2001; later sampling continued under a vet-approved protocol.
  - First biocide application in May 2001 was missed; subsequent applications completed.
  - Data collected included automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical (point quadrat) surveys across multiple plots and treatments.

- 2. Results
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather: rainfall near long-term average; radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than previous years.
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear hierarchy of biomass by treatment; peaks in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass elevated vs. prior years, likely due to site staffing change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Biomass normalized to control (C1) to compare treatment effects; nitrogen and/or lime treatments most effectively boosted biomass.
    - Split-plot ANOVA: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effect.
  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime raised soil pH in top 5 cm: ~6.19 in limed plots and ~6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but less strongly; control pH remained close to baseline (Aug 1998).
  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 point quadrat survey replicated July 2000 protocol; survey consistent between surveyors.
    - 58% more total species hits in 2001 than 2000, suggesting denser sward (possible reduced grazing since 1998).
    - Treatment effects on species: Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased across treatments, especially in fertilised plots (notably Festuca rubra in N&L plots).
    - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) showed more Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis; unimproved plots retained species associated with poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
    - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, hinting at changing diversity with fertility.
    - PCA showed clear separation of improved versus unimproved plots; control/biocide plots were more uniform and associated with bryophytes and species like Agrostis vinealis, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
    - Biomass vs species abundance: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass increased; litter increases with nitrogen and/or lime indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

- 3. Site heterogeneity
  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F exhibited more acidic plots, potentially exaggerated by higher proportions of Control/Biocide plots there.
    - Underlying pH differences linked to column position and plot treatments.
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass varied across plots; outliers with low biomass identified (examples across treatments).
    - Centrally located plots generally showed higher biomass (e.g., certain N&L and lime plots).
    - Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant differences in biomass between blocks (statistical test: non-significant).

- Data and analysis notes
  - Measurements included annual above-ground biomass totals, five summer harvests, and point quadrat surveys with detailed species tallies.
  - Analyses included ANOVA (split-plot) and Principal Components Analysis to explore treatment effects and community composition changes.
  - The report provides extensive tables and figures (e.g., biomass trends, soil pH changes, PCA plots, species abundance) supporting the summarized findings.
