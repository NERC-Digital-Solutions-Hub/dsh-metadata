# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

- The document presents detailed soil profiles and associated data for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on Block 4, Block 5, and ECOTRON plots. It includes horizon descriptions, horizon-by-horizon soil analyses, auger-sample analyses, vegetation surveys, and ECOTRON site data.
- Data types cover physical descriptions, chemical composition, moisture and organic content, pH (water and CaCl2), C and N concentrations, carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) across multiple horizons and depths.
- Samples are linked to MLURI barcodes and include both profile-level (0–100 cm) and horizon-level measurements, with some accompanying vegetation and site metadata.

## Data Structure and Content

- Horizons and depths (example blocks):
  - Block 4: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Block 5: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
- Key metrics (horizons with values shown in the data excerpts):
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio
  - Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g)
  - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition
  - pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2)
  - Texture/structure and root presence descriptions in narrative horizon notes
- Auger samples (Blocks 4 and 5):
  - Individual samples (e.g., 4A–4F, 5A–5F) with %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH, and related values.
- Vegetation data:
  - Subplot-level species counts and presence/absence indicators across plots (e.g., 4A, 4B, 4C, etc.; 5A–5F), indicating species totals and distribution patterns.
- ECOTRON site data:
  - Soil analyses and vegetation survey data for ECOTRON PLOT with horizon-level and plot-level metrics.

## Key Measurements and Patterns

- Soil chemistry and acidity:
  - pH values generally acidic (H2O ~4.5–5.2; CaCl2 ~3.6–4.2 across horizons and blocks).
  - Carbon content varies by horizon; Ah horizons show elevated %C (e.g., Block 5 Ah ~9.36%, FH up to ~33–38% depending on horizon).
  - Nitrogen concentrations range from about 0.4% to over 2% in some top horizons (Block 4 FH ~2.14%, Ah ~0.42–0.65% in Block 5).
  - C:N ratios commonly in the mid-teens to low 20s (e.g., FH ~20, Ah ~14–15, AB/Bg ~10–12 in some auger samples).
- Organic matter and moisture:
  - %Moisture loss and LOI values indicate substantial organic matter content in upper horizons, with LOI often high in the A/H horizons (e.g., Block 4 FH LOI ~73, H ~64, Ah ~14–19; Block 5 FH LOI ~67, H ~60, Ah ~19).
- Cations and exchange capacity:
  - Ca is typically the most abundant exchangeable cation in upper horizons, with Mg, K, and Na in smaller amounts; absolute values vary by horizon and block.
  - Auger samples show broadly similar but lower-level Ca, Mg, K, and Na relative to deeper horizons.
- Soil profile structure:
  - Profiles show a progression from organic-rich surface horizons (LF, FH, H, Ah) to mineral horizons (AB, Bg/BCg, Cg), with variable mottling and horizon boundaries described in the narrative notes.
  - Andesite/igneous stone content is noted in several horizons (Block 4 and Block 5), affecting texture and structure.
- Vegetation associations:
  - Vegetation survey data indicate species composition and abundance patterns per plot, contributing to interpretation of soil-vegetation relationships across micro-sites and horizon layers.

## Data Quality, Gaps and Limitations

- Incomplete and uneven data coverage:
  - Some horizon layers and samples have missing values (denoted by dots), limiting cross-horizon and cross-block comparability in places.
  Several plots show partial data or gaps in vegetation counts and species totals.
- Heterogeneity and formatting:
  - Horizon nomenclature and codes vary by block, with codes such as LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, and others; cross-block standardization would aid integration.
  Data tables are granular and require careful harmonization to enable full meta-analysis.
- Documentation gaps:
  - While barcodes and depths are documented, explicit metadata linking horizon codes across blocks to a unified soil horizon model would improve usability.

## Data Management and Access

- Sample tracking and archiving:
  - Samples are associated with MLURI barcodes and are described at horizon and block levels, with weights (Wt mg) for several horizons.
- Metadata and provenance:
  - The dataset provides horizon descriptions, depth ranges, and measurement units; accompanying notes include boundary types and structural descriptions.
- Collaboration and context:
  - The data forms part of Sourhope ECN/Micronet-related activities, with cross-site relevance and references to broader soil-vegetation datasets and methods.

## Challenges, Gaps and Opportunities for Data Leaders

- Data standardization and interoperability:
  - Need for a consistent horizon nomenclature and mapping across Block 4, Block 5, and ECOTRON data to enable robust cross-block analyses.
- Metadata completeness:
  - Expand and formalize metadata (units, measurement protocols, boundary definitions, field methods) to improve discoverability and reuse.
- Data quality assurance:
  - Implement validation checks for missing values, outliers, and unit consistency; establish a metadata registry and data dictionary.
- Cross-domain integration:
  - Link soil chemistry/horizon data with vegetation data to explore soil-vegetation relationships and long-term ecosystem processes.
- Long-term usability:
  - Ensure persistent storage, versioning, and clear access controls to support ongoing analyses and cross-network collaboration.

## Recommendations for Data Leaders

- Standardize the data model:
  - Develop a unified horizon schema (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg/BCg, Cg) with consistent depth intervals and boundary descriptions.
  - Harmonize units and ensure consistent reporting for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, pH, %Moisture loss, LOI.
- Build a comprehensive data dictionary:
  - Define each horizon code, measurement type, and sample id conventions; document measurement methods and references.
- Enhance metadata and provenance:
  - Attach detailed metadata to each block and horizon, including site details, sampling dates, and any field conditions or deviations.
- Create a central data repository:
  - Store profile, auger, and vegetation data in a queryable database with clear relationships between blocks, horizons, plots, and samples; enable cross-block queries and cross-site comparisons.
- Enable data quality controls:
  - Implement validation rules, gap-filling protocols, and error-checking workflows; provide data quality flags.
- Plan for long-term data reuse:
  - Ensure archiving of raw data, processed data, and documentation; facilitate data sharing with the wider data community and cross-network collaborators.

## Conclusion

- The Rigg Foot data (Blocks 4 and 5, plus ECOTRON) deliver rich, horizon-level soil chemistry and physical properties alongside vegetation surveys, supporting deep analyses of soil-vegetation interactions at the Sourhope site.
- The dataset shows strong potential for monitoring soil health, organic content, and nutrient dynamics across horizons and blocks, but requires standardization, complete metadata, and integrated data management to enable effective cross-block analyses and wider reuse.
