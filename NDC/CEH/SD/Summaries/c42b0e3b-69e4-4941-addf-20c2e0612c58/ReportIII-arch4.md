# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview and context
- Large field experiment as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, located at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for detailed studies; Baseline Data Survey published November 1998 describes site, rationale, design, methods.
- 2001 site management impacted by two events: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May 2001) and a change of Officer in Charge; most management activities (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, Point Analysis) proceeded per 2001 plan, though the first biocide application in May was missed.

## Data collection and timeline
- Measurements spanning 1999–2001 with a focus on context for other research groups; data collection includes weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition (Point Analysis).
- Key measurement dates and protocols documented; weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station transmitted to data managers.

## Main findings

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station (2001)
- 2001 weather was broadly unremarkable relative to recent years.
- Rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar; slightly cooler temperatures; higher soil moisture than previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass throughout the sampling period; peak biomass typically in July–August.
- 2001 biomass higher than in previous years, likely due to personnel changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Nitrogen and/or lime additions increased biomass; nitrogen plus lime produced the strongest effect.
- ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Liming continued to raise soil pH in the top 5 cm: ~6.19 in limed plots; ~6.38 in nitrogen-and-lime plots by October 2001.
- Nitrogen addition alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots remained close to baseline pH measured in August 1998.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- Point Analysis survey (July 2001) largely mirrored 2000 methodology; no significant surveyor differences.
- 2001: total hits 58% higher than 2000, suggesting increased sward density, possibly from grazing stock removal in 1998.
- Species shifts by treatment:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. (ovina and rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (Festuca rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more species associated with improved pastures (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra).
  - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more prominent in untreated Control plots.
- Diversity:
  - 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots.
- Community structure:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) shows clear separation of N and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Biomass correlates with the relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; abundance of Agrostis capillaris, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, Anthoxanthum odoratum declines as biomass increases.
  - Litter presence increases in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed; columns E and F (right-hand side, slope-facing) had comparatively more acidic plots, possibly linked to the treatment mix (many controls/biocide plots in those columns).
- Underlying spatial heterogeneity suggested; pH differences align with treatment distribution across site columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Biomass distribution shows outliers with low biomass in several plots, while central plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.

## Data quality, challenges, and context

- Consistent measurement protocols across years and observers; a dedicated Point Analysis approach with field surveys conducted by trained surveyors to ensure comparability.
- Weather data transmission and integration into a central data management system.
- The 2001 disruption (FMD) and staffing change introduced potential data continuity challenges, but management activities that affect data quality were largely maintained according to the Site Management Plan, with documentation of deviations (e.g., missed May biocide application).
- High data density (multiple measurements per plot per year) with complex blocking structures; analyses include split-plot ANOVA and PCA to interpret treatment effects and community composition.

## Implications for data leadership and data strategy

- The Sourhope dataset demonstrates the value of long-term, multi-factor experimentation for understanding data systems, data provenance, and cross-year comparability.
- Key data governance insights:
  - Maintain detailed metadata on treatments, plot/block structures, and any changes in management or personnel that could influence data collection (as occurred in 2001).
  - Ensure consistent measurement protocols across years and clear documentation of any methodological shifts (e.g., mowing tools changing from manual to mechanical).
  - Capture and manage spatial heterogeneity data to contextualize results and avoid misattributing site effects to treatments.
  - Preserve data lineage and methods for analyses (e.g., ANOVA models, PCA) to support reproducibility and cross-study integration.
- For data collaboration and community of practice:
  - Cross-study sharing of baseline data, measurement schedules, and data processing steps can facilitate broader synthesis across sites with similar experimental designs.
- Potential data reuse opportunities:
  - Temporal trajectories of biomass and pH under different nutrient and liming regimes.
  - Relationships between soil chemistry, plant community shifts, and biomass production for grassland management and biodiversity studies.

## Endnotes and data references

- Detailed tables, figures, and appendices (e.g., biomass time series, soil pH changes, species hits, and PCA loadings) support the findings summarized above.
- Species list notes and coding (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris; Fr = Festuca rubra; Poa pratensis; etc.) are provided in the report’s Appendix and figure captions.
