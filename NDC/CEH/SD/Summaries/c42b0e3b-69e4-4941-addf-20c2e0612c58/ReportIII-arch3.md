# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Purpose and context
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme conducting intensive monitoring at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders.
- Aimed to provide a broad context for detailed studies and enable cross-year comparisons of environmental health indicators.
- Document records management, data collection schedule, and the impact of external events on site management (e.g., Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions in 2001).

## Monitoring approach and data collected
- Measurements and data types
  - Automatic Weather Station: headline measures including rainfall, radiation, air and soil temperatures, and soil moisture.
  - Above-ground biomass: regular harvests across 1999–2001 to assess productivity across treatments.
  - Soil pH: sampling in top 5 cm to track liming and fertilization effects on acidity/alkalinity.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys to monitor species abundance and community shifts.
  - Site management and events: recording of operational changes (e.g., switch from manual to mechanical mowing; changes in site leadership) and external disruptions (FMD restrictions).
- Experimental design and treatments
  - Plot treatments: Control 1 (unimproved), Control 2 (unimproved), Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Biocide.
  - Replication and layout: block design with multiple subplots; yearly comparisons and cross-year analyses.
  - Data handling and analysis: ANOVA (including split-plot ANOVA), transformations of biomass data, and multivariate analyses (Principal Components Analysis) to interpret vegetation shifts.
- Data handling notes
  - Normalization of biomass against a reference plot (C1) to identify treatment effects.
  - Assessment of inter-year effects and treatment-year interactions.
  - Documentation of data collection schedules (Table 1) and species lists (Appendix/Species codes).

## Key results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable compared with prior years.
- Rainfall near long-term average; 2001 rainfall ~839 mm (compared with 845 mm in 1999 and 1209 mm in 2000); radiation ~3439–3473 MJ m^-2; average temperatures slightly lower than previous year.
- Soil moisture modestly higher in 2001.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear hierarchical biomass response across treatments, with peak biomass typically in July–August.
- 2001 biomass estimates were substantially higher than previous years, attributed to staffing changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- When normalised to C1, nitrogen and/or lime continued to show stronger biomass production; the combination of nitrogen and lime (N&L) was the most effective in promoting biomass.
- ANOVA on biomass (ln-transformed)
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.
  
### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition raised soil pH over time.
- October 2001 pH: limed plots ~6.19; N&L plots ~6.38; nitrogen alone also increased pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed no significant change since baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- Point Quadrat survey (July 2001) showed no significant difference between surveyors, but a 58% overall increase in hits in 2001 vs 2000, suggesting denser sward likely due to 1998 reduction in grazing.
- Species-level shifts (2001 vs 2000)
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments; became most abundant mainly in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in N-only and N&L plots (F. ovina) and limed plots (F. rubra).
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) more apparent in fertilised plots, especially N+L.
  - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
- Diversity observations
  - 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting a potential decline in diversity with fertility enhancements.
- Multivariate analysis
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separated nitrogen and/or lime treatments from control/biocide plots.
  - Improved plots associated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots with bryophytes and less fertile indicators.
- Biomass–species relationships
  - Positive correlation between Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance and above-ground biomass.
  - Negative or inverse association for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with increasing biomass.
  - Greater litter frequency in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, reflecting faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
- Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site
  - Columns E and F displayed more acidic conditions, likely reflecting underlying slope-related variation and plot composition (e.g., proportion of Control/Biocide plots).
- Biomass variation
  - Highest biomass generally in centrally located plots (e.g., some N, L, and N&L plots).
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No significant differences in biomass between blocks, indicating consistent spatial effects across the experimental layout.

## Implications for monitoring and policy-relevant indicators
- Integrated monitoring approach (weather, biomass, soil pH, plant community) provides a robust framework to evaluate management actions on environmental health.
- Nutrient enrichment (N and/or lime) increases productivity and drives shifts toward species typical of improved pastures, with potential trade-offs in plant diversity.
- Soil chemistry (pH) responds predictably to liming and interacts with productivity and species composition.
- Site heterogeneity and micro-topography influence outcomes; spatial indicators (soil pH, biomass distribution) should be incorporated into monitoring governance and interpretation.
- Data quality and governance considerations
  - Importance of consistent data collection protocols across years, including changes in personnel and methods (e.g., mowing technique) that can affect biomass estimates.
  - Need for transparent metadata, standardized measurement methods, and cross-year comparability to support policy evaluation and decision-making.
- External disruption risks
  - External events (e.g., FMD restrictions) can interrupt field operations, necessitating contingency planning and documentation to maintain continuity of long-term monitoring.

## Overall takeaway
- The Sourhope field experiment demonstrates how carefully designed, multi-maceted monitoring can reveal how management actions (nitrogen and lime fertilisation) influence productivity, soil chemistry, and plant community structure, while highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity, methodological consistency, and external factors in interpreting long-term environmental health indicators.
