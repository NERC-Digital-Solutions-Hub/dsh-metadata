# SUMMARY

- Context and aims
  - Four-year anniversary of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) focusing on above-ground productivity, plant composition, and diversity, alongside links to soil biota and processes.
  - Central question: how management treatments and site conditions drive changes in plant communities and ecosystem function.

- Site, design, and management
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells allocated to research groups.
  - Five management dimensions applied year-on-year since 1999:
    - Mowing: monthly cuts to ~6 cm from May–Sept; mowing replaces grazing as the primary disturbance.
    - Insecticide: Dursban 4 (chlorpyrifos) applied to Insecticide plots after mowing.
    - Fertility treatments: spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime on designated plots.
    - Plot-level treatments: Control 1, Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime, and Insecticide.
  - Data collection and site activity
    - On-site Automatic Weather Station for climate data (1999–2002).
    - Above-ground biomass: 0.5 m2 samples collected prior to each mow, dried, weighed (since 1999).
    - Baseline and annual botanical surveys using 0.5 m2 point quadrats (2000–2002); bryophyte identification enhanced in 2002.
    - Soil sampling: pH (5 cm depth) regularly since 1998; soil moisture measured in 2002 at the botanical analysis cells.
    - Additional small-scale surveys on vegetation cover, litter, and biomass by project-specific protocols.
  - Research activity
    - Phase I projects largely completed by 2002; Phase II fieldwork continued with CO2 pulses and trace gas measurements using CEH resources.

- Key 2002 findings and patterns
  - Biomass and productivity
    - 2002 saw a general decline in above-ground biomass across several treatments compared with 2001, though all treatments show a long-term rise relative to the 1999 baseline.
    - Nitrogen and Lime together (N+L) produced the strongest productivity, though some signs suggest a potential peak or constraint (soil pH near 7.0 and lower soil moisture) in these plots.
    - Spatial pattern: lower productivity in blocks higher on the slope (Block 5) and highest in lower blocks (Block 1 showed a notable decline in 2002).
  - Soil pH, moisture, and productivity relationships
    - Lime markedly raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in limed plots; nitrogen raised pH modestly; moisture and pH are negatively correlated.
    - Overall, higher pH correlates with higher productivity when examining all treatments together; within some treatments, this relationship weakens or reverses (notably in N+L plots).
  - Plant community composition and diversity (Point Analysis)
    - Improved plots (fertilised) show higher frequencies of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots maintain higher frequencies of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
    - Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts, e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increase across the site, particularly in unimproved plots, contributing to greater bryophyte hits in 2002.
    - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline markedly since 2000 across nearly all treatments, suggesting a mowing-related or disturbance-driven shift away from these species.
    - Diversity (Shannon index)
      - 2002: diversity increased in most treatments relative to baseline; however, the nitrogen+lime treatment recorded a 15% decline in Shannon diversity since 1998 baseline, while other treatments saw gains (up to 29% in some cases).
  - Functional groups and community strategy
    - Three main functional groups dominate: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderals (CSR), and stress-ruderal/CSR (SR/CSR).
    - By 2002, N+L plots show strong expansion of CSR and SR/CSR groups; unimproved plots favor S species.
    - Overall, CSR-related groups become more prominent under higher fertility and lime, while stress-tolerance gains in unimproved plots reflect lower disturbance and fertility.
  - Insecticide effects and trampling considerations
    - Insecticide plots show higher diversity in some year-to-year comparisons; however, a direct causal link between reduced herbivory and increased diversity remains cautious due to limited direct herbivory data.
    - Trampling in C2 plots (notably during 13CO2 pulse experiments) likely contributed to a pronounced drop in productivity in 2002 for those plots.

- Synthesis and implications for monitoring
  - Management triggers clear, tunable responses in productivity, species composition, and diversity, with strong interactions between soil fertility, pH, moisture, and disturbance regime.
  - A mowing-dominated system favors certain grasses and bryophyte expansion; fertilisation shifts community structure toward more competitive, taller grasses and reduced bryophyte dominance in some plots.
  - The CSR framework helps interpret shifts in functional traits under different treatments, linking soil chemistry and disturbance to ecological strategy.
  - Insecticide effects on plant diversity are plausible but require careful attribution due to complex plant-herbivore dynamics and limited direct herbivory data.
  - Data quality and accessibility
    - The project collects standardized datasets (weather, biomass, point quadrats, soil chemistry, bryophyte surveys) across multiple years and treatments, enabling cross-study comparisons and policy-relevant monitoring.
    - A core challenge remains increasing data value through data integration with other datasets and ensuring broad dataset accessibility to researchers and stakeholders.

- Practical considerations for environmental monitoring and policy performance
  - Long-term, standardized monitoring is essential to disentangle disturbance, fertility, and biotic interactions in managed ecosystems.
  - The observed links between management choices (cutting regime, fertilisation, liming, insecticide use) and plant community trajectories highlight the importance of integrating above- and below-ground indicators for environmental health assessments.
  - The mixed responses across productivity, diversity, and functional groups underscore the value of multiple metrics (biomass, species abundance, bryophyte representation, functional-group composition) for robust environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
