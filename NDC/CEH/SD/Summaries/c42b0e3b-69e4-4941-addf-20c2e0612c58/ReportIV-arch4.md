# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on a large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) to understand soil biodiversity and its links to above-ground plant communities, productivity, and nutrient processes.

## Study design and data collection

- Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated randomly.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2 (unmanipulated), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA). Site-wide mowing (~6 cm) applied monthly May–Sept.
- Data collection and management methods:
  - Weather: On-site Automatic Weather Station recording temperature, rainfall, radiation, soil moisture.
  - Above-ground productivity: annual biomass estimates from 0.5 m2 sub-plot clips, oven-dried and weighed; sampling conducted weekly during the mowing season.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline and annual Point Analysis surveys using 0.5 m2 cells and 100-point grid to record species occurrences; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
  - Soil measures: soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture; occasional theta-probe measurements in 2002.
  - Additional small-scale surveys: various plots and periods for cover estimates, biomass, and disturbance-related studies.
  - Data management: comprehensive appendices detailing treatments, species lists, weather, biomass, and analysis; 11621 soil samples collected over the course of the study period.
- Analytical approaches: Split-plot ANOVA (treatment, year, and interaction), regression relationships between pH, moisture, and productivity, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on Point Analysis data, and diversity metrics (Shannon Index).

## Key findings

- Productivity and treatment effects:
  - Fertilised plots (Nitrogen and/or Lime) show higher above-ground biomass than unfertilised plots; the strongest productivity occurs where Nitrogen and Lime are applied together.
  - In 2002, total biomass declined across many treatments relative to 2001, with the largest drops in Control 2 plots and on the slope (Block 5); overall, a long-term trend of increasing biomass since 1999 persists when compared with starting levels.
  - Block position on the slope influences productivity, with lower blocks typically showing greater gains in earlier years but larger declines in 2002.
- Soil chemistry and climate interactions:
  - Lime application markedly raises soil pH toward ~7.0, particularly in the upper soil profile; Nitrogen also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
  - A negative correlation exists between soil moisture and pH; higher pH plots tend to be drier.
  - Across treatments, higher soil pH correlates positively with biomass, though the strength and direction of this relationship vary by treatment.
- Plant community and functional traits:
  - Mowing and disturbance reduction (due to fencing from grazing) promote a shift toward stress-tolerant (S) and competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) functional groups, with reductions in SR/C-S-R groups, especially in fertilised plots.
  - In unimproved plots, stress-tolerant species expand; in fertilised plots, competitive species expand (notably Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in fertilised groups).
  - Bryophyte abundance grows across the site, particularly under mowing and low-nutrient conditions; bryophyte hits rise from 10.8% (2001) to 19.92% (2002) of total hits.
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline by over 40% since 2000, while Festuca rubra increases, contributing to a shift in species composition; Festuca ovina declines while Festuca rubra rises, possibly due to identification challenges.
  - Point Analysis reveals differences in species frequency between improved (fertilised/limed) and unimproved plots; lime and nitrogen treatments show distinct groupings in PCA, separating more fertile species (e.g., Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, Trifolium repens) from species associated with less fertile conditions.
  - Shannon diversity index: increases in most treatments over time, but declines by ~15% in the Nitrogen & Lime (N&L) plots by 2002 compared with baseline; other treatments show 2–29% increases.
- Insecticide and trampling effects:
  - Insecticide treatment shows potential links to higher diversity in some contexts, though direct causation with diversity metrics remains uncertain; possible indirect effects via herbivore pressure and palatable plant establishment.
  - New C2 plots (introduced in 2002) show substantial productivity reductions likely due to trampling during intense sampling activities (e.g., labelled CO2 pulses).
- Bryophytes and litter dynamics:
  - Bryophyte proportion of total hits increases across years, with unimproved plots showing the largest relative bryophyte increases; litter frequency shows significant treatment differences beginning in 2001–2002, with higher litter hits in fertilised plots.

## Data and governance implications for Data Leaders

- Longitudinal, multi-dimensional data ecosystem:
  - Combines biomass, species composition, functional groups, bryophyte data, soil chemistry, and microclimate data across multiple years and treatments.
  - Requires robust metadata, standardized sampling protocols, and consistent data harmonization across years and sub-plots.
- Data quality and gaps:
  - Weather station outage in mid-2002 created gaps; external data substitution was used to mitigate missing periods, highlighting the need for resilience and transparent data provenance.
  - Complex multi-method data (biomass, point hits, PCA, diversity indices) necessitates careful data lineage and documentation for reproducibility.
- Cross-project data sharing and discoverability:
  - Treatment mapping and site activity are documented in appendices; reference to centralized project data (including species lists and treatment schematics) supports cross-project analyses and collaboration.
- Analytical transparency:
  - Use of split-plot ANOVA, LSD tests, and PCA demonstrates statistical rigor; results highlight how management actions influence plant communities, productivity, and functional traits over time.
- Practical takeaways for data strategy:
  - Emphasize comprehensive data dictionaries, standardized ontologies for species and functional groups, and clear linking of treatments to outcomes.
  - Maintain accessible, well-documented data repositories that support downstream analyses and synthesis across Phase I and II projects.
  - Plan for data continuity and redundancy to mitigate environmental and technical disruptions (e.g., weather station outages).

## Conclusion

- The Sourhope site demonstrates clear, long-term links between management practices (grazing exclusion, mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide application) and above-ground productivity, species composition, and functional group dynamics.
- Fertilisation boosts productivity but can alter community structure and ecosystem traits; mowing and reduced disturbance promote stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities.
- Data collected over four years, with extensive appendices and analyses, offer valuable insights for data governance in large, multi-project biodiversity programmes and underscore the importance of robust, discoverable, and well-documented data systems.
