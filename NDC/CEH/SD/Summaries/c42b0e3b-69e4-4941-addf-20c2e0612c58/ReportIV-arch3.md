# SUMMARY

- The document reports four years of monitoring from the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on above-ground productivity (biomass), plant community composition, and diversity within a large, replicated field experiment.
- Core aim: identify environmental health measures to scrutinise policy, evaluate management decisions, and inform future actions.

## Monitoring Framework and Site Design

- Location and program: Sourhope site, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute; 24 Phase I projects (soil structure, processes, micro-fauna, etc.) with Phase II continuing fieldwork.
- Experimental design:
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
  - Each block contains 6 main plots; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system allocates areas to different groups.
  - Five prescribed plot-level treatments plus two controls: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban).
- Management actions:
  - Site-wide mowing monthly May–September (~6 cm sward).
  - Post-mow insecticide application on Insecticide plots.
  - Spring fertilization with nitrogen and/or lime on designated plots.
- Data collection and measures:
  - Weather: continuous on-site Automatic Weather Station.
  - Above-ground biomass: harvest from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells, drying and weighing; annual totals tracked 1999–2002.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline in 1998; annual point analysis (1999–2002) using a 0.5 m2 cell with 100-point grid; bryophytes identified to species level from 2002.
  - Soil: pH measurements at ~5 cm depth; soil moisture (theta probe) in 2002.
  - Additional vegetation metrics: cover estimates, litter frequency, biomass sorting by species, and biodiversity indices.
- Data scale and management:
  - Long-running, multi-year dataset across treatments, blocks, and years (1999–2002).
  - Appendix materials document treatments, species lists, weather data, biomass, and point-analysis results.
  - Total soil samples collected since start: 11,621.
- Data quality and caveats:
  - 2002 weather data period affected by a sensor/software malfunction (about 6 weeks); other data were substituted using a nearby station (Konza) for those dates.
  - Comprehensive metadata and supplementary analyses (appendices) accompany the main text.

## Key Findings ( Highlights from 2002)

- Biomass productivity:
  - Fertilised plots (N and/or lime) show higher productivity; the strongest response when both nitrogen and lime are applied.
  - In 2002, overall biomass declined relative to 2001 across most treatments (13.7% in N&L to 31.2% in Control 2); slope position also influenced productivity (lower on upper blocks).
  - Long-term trend shows rising biomass across treatments since 1999, despite the 2002 drop.
  - Nitrogen and lime together yield the most productive plots; Control 2 remains least productive.
- Soil chemistry and moisture relationships:
  - Lime markedly raises soil pH toward ~7.0; nitrogen also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (more alkaline soils tend to be drier in this setup).
  - Overall positive relationship between soil pH and biomass across treatments; within N or lime alone, the relationship weakens; with N+L the relationship can become negative, suggesting complex interactions.
- Community composition and functional groups:
  - Improved plots (N and/or lime) show higher abundance of fertilised-associated grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis); unimproved plots remain dominated by Agrostis spp.
  - Bryophyte (moss) cover increases across the site, especially in unimproved plots, contributing to higher bryophyte hits in 2002 (19.9% of total hits) compared with 2001 (10.8%).
  - Point analysis shows shifts in dominant species and functional groups:
    - Stress-tolerant (S) species increase in unimproved plots; C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups expand in fertilised plots.
    - In Nitrogen & Lime plots, C-S-R and SR/C-S-R species become dominant; unimproved plots favour S species.
  - Shannon diversity index:
    - Diversity increases in insecticide-treated plots, while N&L treatments show declines (2002 index down ~15% in N&L vs increases in other treatments; insecticide plots show notable increases up to ~29%).
- Litter and bryophyte dynamics:
  - Litter hits show treatment- and year-specific patterns, with notable differences emerging after 2000.
  - Bryophyte diversity and abundance rise, with certain bryophytes responding differently to nitrogen and lime inputs.
- Trampling and disturbance:
  - The C2 plots (new trampling pressure from 13CO2 pulses) show reduced productivity, suggesting trampling/disturbance effects can suppress growth.
- Insecticide effects and herbivore interactions:
  - While direct causation is not proven, insecticide treatment aligns with patterns observed in increased vascular plant diversity in some contexts, consistent with literature on herbivory-mediated plant diversity. The exact mechanism remains uncertain without detailed herbivore data.
- Temporal context:
  - Baseline in 1998; data collection steadily built through 1999–2002; Phase I vs Phase II project activity continued through 2002, including 13CO2 pulse experiments and trace-gas measurements.

## Interpretations for Monitoring and Policy Frameworks

- Disturbance vs fertility:
  - Removing grazing (mowing) interacts with fertility treatments to shape productivity and community composition; disturbance regime (grazing absence, mowing height) strongly influences bryophyte expansion and certain grass species.
- Functional-type metrics:
  - Use of CSR-based functional classifications provides insight into how environmental extremes (stress, disturbance, competition) shift community structure under different management.
- Data quality and governance implications:
  - Longitudinal, multi-factor experiments with standardized measurement protocols are essential for policy-relevant monitoring.
  - Regular documentation of metadata (treatments, timing, measurement methods) and transparent reporting of data gaps (e.g., 2002 weather-data loss) are critical for comparability over time.
- Implications for environmental health indicators:
  - Biomass productivity, plant diversity (Shannon index), and functional group composition (S, CSR, SR/CSR) emerge as core indicators linking management actions to ecosystem function.
  - Soil chemistry (pH) and moisture, and their relationships with productivity, provide actionable signals for nutrient and liming policies.
- Data availability and usability:
  - The report’s appendices (species lists, biomass time series, point-analysis results, and site activity) offer rich data resources; ongoing data sharing and proper metadata curation are important for reproducibility and policy use.

## Notable Data Points and Methods to Inform Monitoring Frameworks

- Measurements and cadence:
  - Biomass: annual totals from May–Sept harvests across five mowing events per year.
  - Vegetation surveys: baseline (1998) and annual 100-hole point analyses (2000–2002) with bryophyte refinement in 2002.
  - Soil: pH at 5 cm; soil moisture measured in 2002.
  - Weather: on-site station data with occasional gaps resolved via nearby stations.
- Experimental treatments and replication:
  - Five blocks; 6 main plots per block; randomised treatments with cross-plot sub-division and 0.5 m2 sampling cells.
- Data scale and outputs:
  - 11,621 soil samples collected since project start; 2002 data include revised bryophyte identifications and expanded species lists.
- Key caveats:
  - 2002 weather data gaps due to sensor malfunction; data substitution and acknowledgement of missing periods in analyses.

- Overall, the Sourhope study demonstrates how a structured, multi-factor monitoring framework can track how management decisions (grazing removal, fertilization, liming, and pest control) influence productivity, biodiversity, and plant functional dynamics over time.
