# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Overview
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Main monitoring of above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and diversity; aims to link above- and below-ground processes.

- Aim of the study
  - Understand how management practices (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide application, and trampling) affect plant productivity and community structure.
  - Explore functional group changes in plant communities and potential feedbacks to soil biodiversity.

- Site and treatments (Methods)
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
  - Treatments (plot-level): 
    - Control 1 and Control 2 (no treatment)
    - Nitrogen (N)
    - Lime (L)
    - Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
    - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA; formerly Biocide)
  - Management tasks (site-wide): monthly mowing to ~6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing on insecticide plots; spring nutrient amendments as per treatment.
  - Data collection (ongoing since 1999-2002): 
    - Automatic Weather Station for climate data
    - Above-ground biomass: harvests from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells per sub-plot; biomass dried and weighed
    - Point analysis surveys: 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid and 25-point footprint recorded to species level
    - Soil pH (5 cm depth) and moisture measurements
    - Bryophyte, lichen, and vascular plant identification; biodiversity indices (Shannon)
  - Projects and datasets: 16 projects in Phase I; most Phase II fieldwork completed in 2002; 11,621 soil samples collected to date.

- Key findings: biomass and productivity
  - Long-term trend: biomass productivity increased across plots from 1999 to 2002, despite a dip in 2002.
  - Treatment effects on productivity (2002 vs 2001):
    - Fertilised plots (N and/or Lime) showed the strongest biomass, especially where both N and Lime applied.
    - 2002: biomass fell across many treatments; reductions ranged from 13.7% (N&L) to 31.2% (Control 2) relative to 2001.
    - Block position on the slope affected productivity, with lower blocks showing larger declines.
  - 2002 biomass per treatment (relative to Control 1): most productive in N&L plots; Control 2 consistently less productive than Control 1 in multiple years.

- Soil chemistry and moisture interactions
  - Lime markedly increased soil pH (approaching 7.0 in the upper soil profile under limed treatments).
  - Nitrogen caused smaller, yet significant, pH increases.
  - Soil moisture negatively correlates with pH (r ≈ -0.68); drier plots tended to be more lime/ nitrogen enriched.
  - Overall, positive associations between higher soil pH and biomass across treatments, but per-treatment nuances:
    - Positive pH–biomass relationship strong overall, but weaker or inverted in plots receiving both N and Lime.

- Plant community composition and functional groups
  - Mowing effect (site-level): consistent decline of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis by >40% since 2000;Festuca rubra increased, especially in fertilised plots.
  - Bryophyte expansion: mosses/bryophytes became more abundant across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; moss contribution to total hits rose from ~11% (2001) to ~20% (2002).
  - Fertilisation effects:
    - Nutrient enrichment promoted fast-growing, nutrient-demanding species (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) in fertilised plots.
    - In plots fertilised with both N and Lime, C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species expanded more than others.
  - Insecticide effects:
    - Possible link between reduced herbivory and higher diversity, but evidence remains circumstantial; not a definitive causal relationship.
  - Trampling effect:
    - First-time sampling in C2 plots in 2002 suggests trampling during pulse experiments may have suppressed vegetation growth, contributing to lower productivity in those plots.

- Biodiversity and community structure
  - Shannon Diversity Index:
    - 2002: diversity declined in the N&L plots relative to other treatments (about a 15% drop vs baseline).
    - Other treatments showed increases (2% to 29%), with the insecticide plots showing notable gains.
  - Point analysis: 2002 survey showed increased hits by grasses associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) in N and Lime treatments; unimproved plots remained dominated by Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.
  - Bryophyte dynamics: bryophyte hits rose across treatments; bryophytes were particularly abundant in unimproved plots and contributed to shifts in overall biomass composition.
  - Functional grouping shifts (CSR framework):
    - Stress-tolerators (S) rose in unimproved plots; C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups expanded in N&L plots.
    - SR/C-S-R groups were reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots, indicating disturbance- and nutrient-driven shifts in functional traits.

- Data-driven outputs and analyses
  - Biomass analyses: yearly and treatment-specific comparisons via log-transformed biomass; significant treatment effects and year-by-treatment interactions.
  - PCA on point analysis data (2002): clear separation between improved and unimproved plots; limed plots cluster together; some nitrogen-treated samples overlap with limed plots.
  - Species-level trends: dominance patterns shifting from Agrostis spp. toward Festuca rubra in fertile plots; bryophyte-rich plots in unimproved treatments.
  - Appendices provide comprehensive datasets: species lists, biomass per plot, weather data, and detailed treatment maps.

- Implications and interpretations (end-state conclusions)
  - Mowing reduces certain competitive grasses (Agrostis spp.) and promotes Festuca rubra; overall disturbance regime influences species turnover and bryophyte expansion.
  - Fertilisation boosts productivity but may reduce diversity over time in highly fertilised plots; soil pH and moisture dynamics play a key role in mediating production and community structure.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but not conclusively causal; potential indirect effects via herbivory pressure warrant further data.
  - Trampling during targeted experiments can have substantial short-term negative impacts on productivity in affected plots.
  - The site demonstrates clear links between management practices, soil chemistry (pH), moisture, plant functional strategies, and biodiversity—providing datasets to explore soil–plant feedbacks and data-driven decision making for land management.

- Relevance for data support and reuse
  - Rich, multi-layered longitudinal datasets (biomass, species hits, soil chemistry, moisture, and weather) suitable for dashboards, trend analyses, and biodiversity monitoring products.
  - Clear documentation of treatments, plots, and sampling schedules enables re-aggregation into end-user-friendly data products (e.g., treatment-wise biomass trends, diversity indices, functional-group composition).
  - Appendices and figures (e.g., biomass trends, PCA plots, species abundance tables) offer ready-made data visuals and exportable datasets for broader reporting and policy contexts.
