# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Purpose and setting
  - Intensive field experiment at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for linking with detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons in environmental health indicators.
  - Monitoring data described follow a standardized approach to support cross-year scrutiny of environmental health and management impacts.
  - Key management events in 2001: Foot and Mouth restrictions limited site access (Feb–May 2001); later, change of Officer in Charge.

- Data collection and monitoring scope
  - Data types collected: Automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH (top 5 cm), botanical composition (Point Quadrat surveys), and site-level bookkeeping (tabulated schedules).
  - Sampling cadence: Regular biomass harvests (May–Sept), seasonal soil sampling, and annual botanical surveys (July).
  - Data handling: Weather data transmitted to the MLURI Soil Biodiversity Data Manager; standardized protocols used for sampling and analysis to enable year-to-year comparisons.

2. RESULTS

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 headline weather: rainfall near long-term annual average; radiation similar to prior years; average air temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture content modestly higher than in previous years.
  - Climate data consistency supports contextual interpretation of biomass and plant-community responses.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Across treatments, a consistent hierarchy of biomass was observed, with peak production in July–August.
  - 2001 biomass higher than previous years, likely due to personnel changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass analyses normalized to a control (C1) to reveal treatment effects; nitrogen and/or lime additions produced the strongest biomass responses.
  - Statistical findings: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) versus non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effect.

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Lime additions consistently raised topsoil pH; October 2001 values: limed plots ~6.19; nitrogen plus lime plots ~6.38.
  - Control plots remained close to baseline values established in 1998; nitrogen alone raised pH to a lesser extent.

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - July 2001 point quadrat survey showed high sampling effort with no significant surveyor bias.
  - 2001 hits were 58% higher than 2000, indicating increased sward density, possibly from the removal of grazing stock in 1998.
  - Species-level shifts by treatment:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments; remained most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
    - Festuca species increased across treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide (F. ovina) and N+L (F. rubra) plots.
    - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) enriched in fertilised plots (notably N and N+L).
    - Species linked with less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots (Control/Biocide).
  - Diversity: unimproved plots supported 24 species; improved plots (N and/or Lime) supported 18 species, suggesting a potential decline in species richness with enhancements.
  - Multivariate patterns: Principal Components Analysis separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; improved plots exhibited more extreme PC scores.
  - Biomass association: higher biomass correlated with greater relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with increasing biomass; litter increases with nitrogen and/or lime indicating faster vegetation turnover.
  - Additional observation: increased litter and turnover linked to higher soil fertility.

3. SITE HETEROGENEITY

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed across columns; columns E and F exhibited more acidic plots, partly due to treatment composition (more Controls/Biocide in those columns).
  - Underlying spatial pattern suggests pH and community composition gradients across the site.

- 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
  - Biomass distribution showed notable within-site variation: several low-biomass outliers existed, while higher biomass was common in more central plots (e.g., N+L 2E, Lime 2C, Biocide 2D, Control 1 2B).
  - Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, reinforcing the link between fertility/pH and productivity.
  - No significant difference in biomass between blocks, indicating limited block-level variability in 2001.

- Observational and analytical notes
  - Consistency checks: inter-surveyor comparison for point quadrat data showed no significant bias (p = 0.18 NS).
  - Table/Appendix references indicate detailed annual biomass figures and species-by-treatment abundances, with PCA and ANOVA analyses supporting the reported patterns.
  - Variation in management and sampling approaches in 2001 (e.g., shift to mechanical cutting) are acknowledged as influencing biomass measurements and interpretation.

- Implications for environmental monitoring
  - The Sourhope dataset demonstrates how standardised, multi-mactor monitoring can reveal links between soil chemistry (pH), plant-community structure, and productivity under different nutrient and liming regimes.
  - Shifts in species composition and reduced diversity in more fertilised plots highlight potential trade-offs between productivity and biodiversity in managed grasslands.
  - Spatial heterogeneity within experimental fields underscores the importance of accounting for site-scale variability when interpreting monitoring outputs.

- Summary takeaway for environmental analysts
  - The monitoring framework yields comparable, multi-year indicators of environmental health, including climate context, productivity, soil chemistry, and biodiversity signals.
  - Treatments involving nitrogen and lime produce clear, measurable effects on biomass, soil pH, and plant community structure, but may reduce species diversity and alter spatial patterns of biomass.
  - Data quality processes (e.g., standardized protocols, cross-checks between surveyors) support reliable longitudinal analysis and policy-relevant environmental assessment.
