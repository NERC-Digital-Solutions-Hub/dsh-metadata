> Notes
- All samples show acidic to near-acidic pH (H2O) around 4.4–4.8; CaCl2 pH around 3.6–4.0.
- Carbon content ranges ~6.8–8.0%, indicating substantial organic matter in surface horizons; LOI values are relatively high (14–18%), consistent with organic-rich topsoil.
- Calcium (Ca) generally mid-range (1.01–2.96 meq/100g); magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) values moderate; sodium (Na) is consistently low (~0.12–0.15 meq/100g).
- C:N ratios cluster around 12.6–14.3, with higher values associated with higher C relative to N.

## Block 4 Vegetation Survey
- Accompanied by a vegetation survey across plots 4A–4F, detailing presence/absence and totals of species per subplot.
- Data show variability in species composition across subplots, reflecting microhabitat differences within Block 4.
- Survey results support linking soil properties with plant community composition within the same area and treatments.

## Block 5 Context (Sitewide Extension)
- Site details for Block 5 included (grid reference, altitude, soil drainage, major soil subgroup, parent material, etc.).
- Includes a soil profile sequence (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with multiple horizons characterized for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH(H2O), and pH(CaCl2).
- Auger data for Block 5 (samples 5A–5F) provide a broader context of soil chemistry across deeper and more developed horizons.

## ECOTRON COMPONENTS
- ECOTRON PLOT data include soil chemistry (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH) and vegetation survey outputs.
- Demonstrates integration of controlled-environment subplots with field data for long-term environmental monitoring.

## Data Identifiers and Storage
- Samples are identified by MLURI barcodes (e.g., 4A–4F for Block 4 augers; 1 for ECOTRON plot; 5A–5F for Block 5 augers).
- Data include both chemical measurements and vegetation outputs, designed for archiving and cross-plots comparison.

## Relevance to Environmental Monitoring
- Illustrates how a standardized set of soil chemistries (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, LOI, moisture) combined with pH measurements can illuminate soil health and fertility status.
- Enables examination of relationships between soil properties and vegetation composition across microtopography and management treatments.
- Supports long-term monitoring objectives by providing repeatable measurements aligned with broader field and ECN data collection goals.
