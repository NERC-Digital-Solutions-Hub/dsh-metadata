# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview and purpose
- Documentation and long-term storage of data from Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Research Site (established 1998) focusing on soil biodiversity, vegetation, and their relationships.
- Aims to provide secure facilities, background context (climate, soils, vegetation), and a design framework to study indigenous vegetation and sustainable hill farming systems.
- Data focus includes vegetation surveys, soil chemical/physical properties, and their interrelationships within a controlled experimental framework.

## Site context and experimental design
- Location: Sourhope Experimental Farm, near Kelso, Scotland; multi-block site with altitudinal and vegetation variation.
- Site characteristics: Humid upland climate; soils range from acid brown forest soils to gleys and podzols; diverse parent materials including andesite.
- Land use: Predominantly grassland with conifer plantations and moorland; livestock management historically integrated with grazing studies.
- Experimental blocks: Block 4 and Block 5 (with additional ECOTRON/ECOTRON PLOT data) featuring per-block site details, grid references, slope, drainage, and soil subgroups.
- Treatments and sampling design: Per-block plots subdivided into main plots and subplots; treatments include lime, nitrogen, biocide, fallow (legacy), with grazing exclusion and mowing to simulate grazing pressure; long-term perturbation study to link vegetation responses to soil chemistry.

## Data collected and structure

### Vegetation data
- Data by plot/subplot (e.g., Blocks 4 and 5: plots 4A–4F, 5A–5F) including presence/absence and counts for multiple species.
- Outputs include species totals per subplot, dominant and indicator species, and approximate abundance indicators.
- Analytical framing includes identifying dominant communities and potential associations between species and micro-sites.

### Soil data
- Per-horizon soil profiling (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, and other horizon designations) across blocks, with detailed soil descriptions (color, structure, roots, stones).
- Chemical and physical properties per horizon:
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio
  - Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g)
  - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI)
  - pH (H2O) and pH CaCl2
  - Weight (mg) for sample portions
- Auger samples (0–30 cm) per plot in W-pattern collection; additional horizon pits for profile description.
- Sites include Block 4 and Block 5 with laboratory data for each horizon (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg/BCg, Cg, etc.) and per-plot auger data.

### ECOTRON data
- ECOTRON PLOT has dedicated soil analysis (per horizon) and vegetation survey data, mirroring Block 4/5 structure for integrated analysis under controlled environmental conditions.

### Site details and metadata
- Block-level site details include grid references, altitude, slope, soil drainage, soil series, parent material, and major soil subgroups (e.g., Brown forest soil with gleying).
- Sample handling and archival methods include specimen weights, storage details, and MLA/MLURI barcode identifiers for traceability.

## Data structure, quality, and analysis

- Organization: Data are organized by block, plot, subplots, horizon (for soils), and quadrats (for vegetation), with multiple data tables and appendices.
- Data types: 
  - Vegetation: species lists, presence/absence, counts per subplot, and species totals per plot.
  - Soils: horizon-by-horizon chemical and physical properties, LOI, moisture, pH, C/N, and exchangeable cations.
  - Auger and profile data: horizon-specific metrics and horizon descriptors.
- Quality and limitations:
  - Patchy sampling in some plots, block-to-block variability, and horizon-specific differences require normalization.
  - Depth- and horizon-dependent variation necessitates careful interpretation when comparing across plots or blocks.
- Analysis approach:
  - Vegetation: community classification and indicator species analyses; potential alignment with National Vegetation Classification (NVC) categories.
  - Soils: descriptive statistics, C/N, LOI, moisture, pH correlations; block and horizon effects; relationships among nutrient contents and soil chemistry.
  - Multivariate context: nutrient content and organic matter indicators drive major variation; pH forms a secondary axis.

## Key findings and implications for data use

- Vegetation patterns show dominance by a subset of grasses with increasing species richness downslope; multiple vegetation communities are detectable and align with NVC-like groupings.
- Soils are generally acidic with high organic matter near the surface; horizon-specific nutrient distributions show clear depth-related and block-related variation.
- Data enable linking vegetation responses to soil chemistry under different perturbations (lime, nitrogen, biocide, etc.) for long-term biodiversity and ecosystem-function studies.
- Data quality considerations highlight the need for normalization when cross-block comparisons are made and for careful interpretation of horizon-level data.

## Practical takeaways for data use and end-user enablement

- Maintain clear traceability: link plots, subplots, horizons, and quadrats with consistent coding to support self-serve queries.
- Standardize identifiers: use consistent plot, horizon, and treatment codes to enable cross-study aggregation.
- Provide baseline and metadata: include vegetation lists, species occurrences, and horizon-specific soil chemistry with sampling dates, methods, and block treatments.
- Develop data products:
  - Horizon-level soil property profiles by block/plot
  - Site- and block-level vegetation composition dashboards
  - Longitudinal data pipelines for ECN/SERAD Micronet integrations
- Use-case orientation: explore plant–soil interactions under perturbations and support long-term ecological monitoring and biodiversity policy-relevant assessments.
