# SUMMARY

- The NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) undertook a four-year, large-field study to understand soil biodiversity and the links between below-ground processes and above-ground plant communities, focusing on productivity, species composition, and diversity.

- Major management processes driving botanical changes:
  - Mowing: year-round cutting to ~6 cm after fencing; promotes Festuca spp. over Agrostis spp.; may boost bryophyte abundance in unfertilised conditions.
  - Fertilisation: nitrogen and/or lime treatments increase productivity; lime raises soil pH toward ~7.0; potential moisture stress and chlorosis in some lime/nitrogen plots.
  - Insecticide: Dursban treatment to insecticide plots; potential association with higher plant diversity, possibly via reduced herbivory, though a direct causal link is not established.

- Data and datasets generated (types, timing, and scope):
  - Above-ground biomass: annual totals per plot, derived from May–Sept mowing harvests; five cuts per summer; 0.5 m2 sampling cells within sub-plots; data normalized to Control1 for cross-year comparison.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline and annual point analyses (1998 baseline; 2000–2002 surveys) using 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grids; bryophyte identification improved in 2002.
  - Soil measurements: soil pH (centered at ~5 cm, with updates in 2002), soil moisture (theta probe in 2002), and routine soil sampling since 1998.
  - Weather data: continuous on-site Automatic Weather Station data since Feb 1999 (rainfall, radiation, temperature).
  - Site activity and management records: detailed appendices recording treatments, mowing, sample collection, and field activities; maps of plot treatments; biomass and species data by plot/year.

- Experimental design and treatments:
  - Rigg Foot site: 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated randomly.
  - Treatments (plot-level): Control1 (no treatment), Control2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide.
  - Management events: monthly mowing (May–Sept) across the whole site; insecticide applied after mowing; spring fertilisation for designated plots.

- Data processing, analysis, and indicators:
  - Biomass data are log-transformed for ANOVA; results show significant treatment effects and year-by-treatment interactions.
  - Productivity trends: long-term increase from 1999–2002 across all treatments; strongest biomass with Nitrogen + Lime; Control2 plots consistently less productive than Control1 subsequently.
  - Relationships analysed between soil pH, moisture, and productivity; pH rise (due to lime) correlates with productivity changes, with complex treatment-specific patterns.
  - Point Analysis data used for functional group analyses (stress-tolerators S; competitive-stress-ruderals CSR; SR/CSR) and diversity metrics (Shannon index); treatments shift functional-group composition over time.
  - Multivariate analyses (PCA) reveal clear separation between improved (fertilised) and unimproved plots; bryophyte frequency rising across the site, especially in unimproved plots.

- Key findings relevant to data stewardship and reuse:
  - Fertilisation consistently enhances above-ground biomass, especially with combined Nitrogen + Lime, though productivity in lime-heavy plots may peak and potentially decline if soil moisture is limiting.
  - Mowing as a disturbance alters species composition: decline in Agrostis spp., rise in Festuca rubra in fertilised plots, and notable bryophyte expansion under reduced disturbance.
  - Insecticide treatments show higher diversity in surveys, with potential indirect effects via reduced herbivory, but causality remains to be confirmed.
  - Large-scale, long-term data collection enables evaluation of nutrient, pH, moisture, and disturbance interactions on plant community structure and productivity.

- Data governance considerations and challenges for Data Stewards:
  - Complex, multi-source, multi-year datasets requiring integrated metadata (treatment mappings, mowing schedules, administration dates, sampling protocols).
  - Documentation essential for data discoverability: Appendices (site layout, treatment details, species lists, weather data, biomass data) provide critical context and provenance.
  - Data gaps and transparency: 2002 weather data includes missing periods due to telemetry failure; where possible, substitute data from nearby stations with clear annotations.
  - Interoperability: taxonomic updates (e.g., bryophyte identification improvements) and shifting functional-group classifications (S, CSR, SR/CSR) require careful versioning and documentation to maintain comparability across years.
  - Accessibility: data and methodological details are linked to the Soil Biodiversity programme website and CEH-hosted materials; consider structured, machine-readable metadata and persistent identifiers to support long-term reuse.

  - Appendix 4: site activity summaries and data collection counts.
  - Appendix 5: Automatic Weather Station headline data (1999–2002) with notes on data gaps.
  - Appendix 6–8: biomass data by plot, rank analyses, and species-hits rankings from point analyses; PCA results and functional-group breakdowns.
