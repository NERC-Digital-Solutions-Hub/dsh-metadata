# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; full site description and design documented in Baseline Data Survey (1998).
- Monitoring programmed to provide context for detailed studies and to facilitate year-to-year comparisons (measurements listed in Table 1).
- 2001 management events:
  - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited site access from February to May; post-restriction sampling proceeded under a vet-approved protocol.
  - Change of site Officer in May 2001.
- Objectives: track automatic weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition across treatments and years, with attention to site heterogeneity.

## 2. Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average (839 mm in 2001 vs 845 mm in 1999; 1209 mm in 2000).
- Radiation around 3473–3479 MJ m^-2; average air and soil temperatures marginally lower in 2001.
- Higher average soil moisture content in 2001 compared with previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy: nitrogen and/or lime additions increased biomass relative to controls; biomass peaked in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass substantially higher than prior years, likely due to a combination of:
  - Change in personnel
  - Switch from manual cutting to mechanical shear in 2001
- Analyses (ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass) show:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.
- Normalising all treatments to the C1 (control) baseline confirms sustained positive impact of nitrogen and lime on productivity.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime continued to raise surface soil pH (upper 5 cm):
  - Limed plots: pH ≈ 6.19 (October 2001)
  - Nitrogen + Lime plots: pH ≈ 6.38
  - Nitrogen alone: pH increased but less than lime-containing treatments
  - Control plots showed no significant change since baseline (August 1998)

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis mirrored July 2000; no significant difference between surveyors, but total hits were 58% higher in 2001 than 2000, suggesting denser sward (potentially from reduced grazing since 1998).
- Treatment effects on species composition:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ovina, rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and Nitrogen + Lime (Festuca rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots (fertilised and/or lime-treated) showed more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were prominent in fertilised plots, especially N+L.
  - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) were more common in unimproved plots (Control/Biocide).
- Species richness:
  - 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen + Lime plots, suggesting a possible drop in diversity with strong fertility treatments.
- Multivariate analysis:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) separates plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime from control and biocide plots.
  - Improved plots show greater association with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis; unimproved plots cluster with Agrostis vinealis, Bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Biomass correlation:
  - Higher biomass correlates positively with relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Increases in biomass correspond with declines in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) and Agrostis vinealis.
  - Nitrogen and/or lime treatment associated with increased litter, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## 3. Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Persistent spatial heterogeneity: columns E and F (right-hand side, up the slope) contain more acidic plots compared with columns on the left.
- Although partly influenced by treatment distribution (more Controls and Biocide plots in those columns), underlying spatial variation likely drives observed pH differences in nitrogen and/or lime plots.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Some plots consistently low in biomass across treatments (e.g., specific Control 1/2, Nitrogen, Lime, Biocide plots).
- Higher biomass tends to be associated with central site location (e.g., Nitrogen + Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, though no significant differences between blocks in biomass.

## Endnotes
- Overall 2001 results indicate that nitrogen and lime amendments promote higher above-ground productivity and shift plant communities toward species typical of more fertilised pastures, accompanied by increases in litter and turnover. 
- Soil pH increases with liming align with observed shifts in species composition and biomass.
- Site heterogeneity plays a meaningful role in modulating responses, with spatially varying pH and biomass across columns influencing treatment outcomes.
