- Organic matter and soil development:
  - Very high LOI in the surficial horizons (Ah and FH dominated by organic-rich material), with substantial mineral fraction deeper down.
- Texture and mottling:
  - Bg/BCg horizons show mottling and clay-enriched layers; deeper horizons (Cg) are more clay loam to loam with igneous fragments.
- Implications:
  - pronounced vertical gradient in nutrient stocks and organic matter; persistent acidity throughout the profile with slightly higher pH in deeper horizons; notable variation between horizons and across blocks indicating micro-site differences relevant for model parameterization.

## ECOTRON soil site
- Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT, Block/Plot 1):
  - %N: 0.59; %C: 8.22; C:N: 13.83
  - Ca: 2.76; Mg: 1.7; Na: 0.15; K: 0.62
  - %Moisture loss: 4.79; %Loss on Ignition: 17.42
  - pH (H2O): 4.79; pH (CaCl2): 3.82
- Vegetation survey:
  - Plot-level species counts show diverse herbaceous assemblages with multiple species contributing to overall composition.

## Vegetation surveys (blocks 4 and 5; ECOTRON)
- Data include species inventories by plot/subplot with totals and presence/absence indicators.
- Dominant components typically include upland grasses and forbs, with community patterns aligning with soil gradients, moisture, and topography.
- Indicator species and community groupings identified, consistent with upland grassland vegetation classifications.

## Data management and context
- Each sample and horizon is documented with MLURI barcodes and horizon codes, enabling traceability and re-analysis.
- Data support analyses of soil chemistry, organic matter distribution, soil–vegetation relationships, and potential responses to management perturbations (e.g., lime, nitrogen, biocides, disturbance).
- Appendices and supplementary material provide detailed horizon-by-horizon tables, auger datasets, and vegetation inventories for reproducibility and data reuse.

## Key takeaways for data-driven decision making
- Sourhope provides a well-documented, multi-block dataset showing strong vertical gradients in organic matter, acidity, and nutrient stocks, with substantial heterogeneity between blocks.
- Surficial horizons are highly organic and acidic, transitioning to more mineral-dominated subsoils with mottling and gley features, which has implications for nutrient availability and lime/nitrogen management strategies.
- Soil–vegetation relationships are pronounced, enabling predictive modeling of ecosystem responses to perturbations and informing upland grassland management decisions.
- Robust data management and archived samples support reproducibility, long-term monitoring, and re-use in policy, research, and forecasting contexts.
