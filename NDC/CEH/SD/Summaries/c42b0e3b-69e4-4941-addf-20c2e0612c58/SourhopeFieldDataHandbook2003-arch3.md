# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

## Purpose and scope of this block
- Provides detailed soil profile descriptions, depth horizons, and laboratory analyses for Block 4 at the Rigg Foot/Sourhope field site.
- Documents both horizon-level soil properties and auger-sample analyses, plus accompanying vegetation surveys and ecotron/ECN data.

## Soil profile description (Block 4)
- Horizon sequence and descriptions (depths in cm):
  - LF: 0–1 cm — fibrous, moist; no mineral grains; smooth boundary.
  - FH: 1–4 cm — fibrous, moist; abundant very fine roots; sharp boundary.
  - H: 4–8 cm — black, amorphous matrix; moist; weak blocky structure; many roots; sharp boundary.
  - Ah: 8–29 cm — dark reddish-brown; sandy silt loam; friable; many roots; presence of igneous stones; sharp boundary.
  - Abg: 29–40 cm — pinkish grey with mottling; coarse sandy loam; moderate blocky structure.
  - B sg: 40–61 cm — brown; sandy silt loam; mix of roots and stones; boundary sharp.
  - C gx: 61–95 cm — reddish-brown to brown; sandy clay loam; massive to platy structure; abundant igneous stones.
- Notable features: thick Ah horizon with substantial organic matter; significant igneous stone content in subsoils; distinctive color and structure transitions.

## Soils: Block 4 Auger samples
- Auger sample depth range not shown here; data include sub-samples 4A–4F with:
  - %N ~0.56–0.58; %C ~7.00–8.02; C:N ~12.6–14.3.
  - Ca ~1.0–5.0 meq/100g; Mg ~0.75–3.5; K ~0.58–0.81; Na generally low or absent in several samples.
  - %Moisture loss ~4.3–5.2; %LOI ~4.5–17.9; pH H2O ~4.45–4.93; pH CaCl2 ~3.53–4.14.
- Overall: auger horizons show elevated organic content near the surface with acidic pH and typical nutrient patterns (Ca, Mg, K) tapering with depth.

## Vegetation survey: Block 4
- Plot-level vegetation data (4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F) show species presence totals across subplots.
- Patterns indicate variability among plots, with certain plots recording higher species totals and others with sparse data; edge vs interior subplots show differential species assemblages.
- Indicator-like species and associations are reflected in subplot totals, consistent with the site’s grassland/sward composition under long-term management.

## Ecotron and related datasets
- ECOTRON PLOT data (Block 4) include soil analyses with Wt ~6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N ~13.83; Ca ~2.76; Mg ~1.7; pH H2O ~4.79; pH CaCl2 ~3.82.
- Vegetation survey for ECOTRON PLOT records subplot-level totals and species presence, enabling controlled-environment comparisons with field plots.

## Data governance and integration notes (Block 4)
- Samples are linked to unique identifiers (MLURI Barcodes) and accompanied by weight measurements, horizon designations, and multiple analyses.
- Data are organized to support integration across horizons, auger samples, and vegetation surveys, enabling cross-parameter analyses (soil–vegetation–environment).
- Metadata and archive workflows (e.g., horizon descriptions, site details, and instrumented measurements) are designed to support transparency and reproducibility in monitoring frameworks.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation (Block 4)
- Indicators captured:
  - Soil health: organic matter (LOI), carbon/nitrogen ratios, soil acidity (pH), exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K), moisture characteristics.
  - Vegetation status: plot-level species composition and richness with edge/interior spatial patterns.
- Experimental layout supports perturbation assessment (within-block controls vs treatments) and long-term trend analysis across soil and vegetation domains.
- Data governance emphasis:
  - Standardized sampling methods, horizon nomenclature, and open documentation to facilitate data sharing and reuse.
  - Clear data provenance via barcoded samples and archived datasets, addressing common data-silo and metadata-gap challenges in monitoring.

## Endnotes on scope for Block 4 (and brief on Block 5 context)
- Block 4 provides a comprehensive baseline of soil profiles, horizon-level chemistry, auger sampling, and vegetation data within a multi-block monitoring framework.
- Block 5 expands site details, deeper horizon sequences, auger samples, and vegetation data, reinforcing cross-block comparability.
- Additional ECOTRON and broader Block 5 data (including detailed site metadata) illustrate the integration of field and controlled-environment components within a cohesive environmental-monitoring program.
