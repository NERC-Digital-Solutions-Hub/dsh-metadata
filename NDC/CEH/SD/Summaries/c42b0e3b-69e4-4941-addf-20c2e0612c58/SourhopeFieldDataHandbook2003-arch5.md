# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- This chunk presents detailed data for Sourhope field sites, focusing on Blocks 4 and 5 with associated soil profiles, soil analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys, plus ECOTRON plot data.

## Scope and contents of this chunk
- Block 4 data:
  - Detailed soil profile descriptions (labels such as LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx) with depth intervals.
  - Soil analysis for each horizon, including MLURI barcodes, weight (mg), %N, %C, C:N ratios, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Auger sample analyses (4A–4F) with corresponding chemical and physical measurements.
  - Vegetation survey data for plot 4A (and surrounding subplots) with species tallies and totals by subplot.
- Block 5 data:
  - Site details (grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material) and soil profile descriptions (0–100 cm) including horizon names such as LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg.
  - Soil analysis for Block 5 horizons (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Auger sample analyses for Block 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F with corresponding measurements (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH).
  - Vegetation survey data for Block 5 plots (5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F) with subplot-level species tallies and totals, including per-species counts across subplots.
- ECOTRON plot data:
  - Soil analysis for ECOTRON plot (MLURI barcode 603930) including Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Vegetation survey for ECOTRON plot with species tallies across subplots.
- Cross-referencing data:
  - All horizons and samples are associated with MLURI barcodes, enabling traceability to individual profiles and horizons.
  - Data align with ECN/SERAD framework, facilitating cross-site comparisons and long-term analyses.

## Data structure, provenance, and storage
- Hierarchical data organization:
  - Block → Plot → Subplot → Horizon (for soil data) and Plot/Subplot IDs for vegetation data.
- Horizon designation and depth ranges:
  - Common horizon labels include LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg (Block 4 and Block 5), with explicit depth intervals.
- Sample identifiers and archiving:
  - Horizon-level samples have MLURI barcodes (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; 4A–4F auger samples; Block 5 horizons and auger samples).
- Data storage and stewardship context:
  - Data are part of Sourhope ECN activities; archived and managed through MLURI/CEH, with traceable sample IDs and horizon codes.
  - ECOTRON data are included to support controlled-environment comparisons and long-term monitoring.

## Variables and data quality
- Soil chemistry and physical properties:
  - Percent nitrogen (%N), percent carbon (%C), carbon:nitrogen ratio (C:N).
  - Cation content: Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g).
  - Soil moisture and inorganic/organic indicators: %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI).
  - Acidity indicators: pH in water (pH(H2O)) and in CaCl2 (pH(CaCl2)).
- Vegetation data:
  - Plot-level and subplot-level species tallies, totals by subplot, and species counts across plots.
- Data quality considerations:
  - Some entries contain missing values (noted as .) across horizons, auger samples, and vegetation tallies, indicating incomplete coverage in certain subplots or horizons.
  - Wide horizon-to-horizon variation and block-specific patterns observed, underscoring the need for careful data validation and context-aware interpretation.

## Metadata, provenance, and governance considerations
- Metadata completeness:
  - Site details (grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material) and horizon depths are critical for proper interpretation and cross-site comparisons.
  - Horizon and sample naming conventions (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) should be consistently documented in data dictionaries.
- Provenance and traceability:
  - Horizon and auger samples are linked to MLURI barcodes, enabling traceable lineage from field collection to laboratory analysis and subsequent analyses.
- Archiving and long-term preservation:
  - Emphasis on preserving barcodes, horizon codes, and horizon-depth information to sustain traceability and reproducibility in future analyses.

## Practical takeaways for data stewardship
- Metadata best practices:
  - Capture and maintain comprehensive metadata per horizon and per sample: site coordinates, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, horizon depth ranges, sampling date, plot/subplot identifiers, treatment or Ecotron status, and sample IDs.
- Data quality controls:
  - Track and flag missing data by horizon, plot, or subplot; document reasons for missing data where known.
  - Ensure unit consistency across tables (e.g., %N, %C, C:N, meq/100 g for cations, LOI, pH values).
- Data integration and reuse:
  - Maintain clear linkages between soil data and vegetation data via plot IDs and horizon data to support integrated analyses (e.g., soil-vegetation correlations).
  - Preserve and document MLURI barcodes and horizon designations to enable exact replication or extension of analyses.
- Archiving and access:
  - Ensure long-term storage of horizon samples, auger samples, and associated metadata; maintain accessibility to primary datasets (tables of soil chemistry, horizon descriptions) and analysis outputs (e.g., vegetation tallies, horizon comparisons).
- Governance and licensing:
  - Provide guidance on data licensing, usage rights, and citation to support responsible reuse within ECN/SERAD frameworks and cross-site collaborations.

## Quick reference: key patterns in this chunk
- Soils exhibit horizon-level variability with persistent acidity across Block 4 and Block 5 horizons (pH values typically in the acidic range; some horizons show lower Ca and Mg relative to CaCl2 extracts).
- Organic matter indicators (MOISTURE LOSS, LOI) vary by horizon, with higher LOI in Ah/AB horizons and lower in mineral horizons.
- Cation content (Ca, Mg, K, Na) and C/N relationships show block- and horizon-specific patterns, underscoring within-site heterogeneity.
- Vegetation data per plot/subplot provide species tallies and totals, enabling future correlations with soil chemistry and horizon-depth contexts.
- ECOTRON data add a controlled-environment dimension to compare with field data, reinforcing the data’s value for long-term environmental monitoring and cross-site analyses.
