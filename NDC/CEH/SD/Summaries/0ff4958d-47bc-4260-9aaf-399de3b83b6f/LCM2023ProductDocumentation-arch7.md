# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

- UKCEH LCM2023 is the eleventh UK land cover map, producing annual 10 m classified pixels, land parcel datasets, and 25 m rasterised land parcels, for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, plus a 1 km (GB+NI) summary raster product.
- Maps use 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes aligned with Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats, described with caveats about differences between UKCEH classifications and BAP broad habitats.
- Overall formal validation accuracy is 83% across 21 classes.

## Product suite and data structure

- Datasets (three per region, GB and NI) plus a 1 km summary raster:
  - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Land Parcel Datasets (GB and NI)
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - 1 km Summary rasters (GB and NI)
- Data specifics:
  - 10 m Classified Pixels: mosaic of Classification Scenes; first band = most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class, second band = class membership probability.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels: three bands per parcel – dominant land cover (_mode), confidence (_conf), and purity (_purity).
  - 1 km rasters: dominant class per 1 km pixel (1 band) and 21-band and 10-band percentage/aggregate summaries; rounding may cause minor totals not to sum exactly to 100.
- Coordinate systems:
  - Great Britain: British National Grid, EPSG 27700
  - Northern Ireland: Irish Grid TM75, EPSG 29903
- Parcel framework:
  - UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework with ~0.5 ha minimum area (MMU); parcels are generalised land units (fields, parks, urban areas, etc.) to support change detection.

## Data production and methodology

- Classification basis:
  - Land cover is derived by classifying Classification Scenes created from Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images plus Context Rasters.
- Seasonal imagery:
  - Seasonal Composite Images built from four 3-month periods (Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec) using ten Sentinel-2 bands; data gaps are tolerated.
- Context information:
  - Context Rasters (10 for GB; 9–10 for NI) provide terrain, proximity to features (buildings, roads), coastal proximity, foreshore, gyres of water, and land/water masks to reduce spectral confusion.
- Bootstrap Training:
  - Automatic training data generated from historic LCMs (2020–2022) by selecting pixels with >80% probability classified consistently across three years; used to bootstrap the Random Forest classifier.
  - Crops rotations can affect training for arable/improved grassland; some training data replaced with UKCEH Land Cover Plus: Crops data for 2023.
- Machine learning:
  - Random Forest classifier trained on bootstrapped samples; balanced sampling by bagging 10,000 samples per class per tree; bespoke UKCEH software integrates WEKA, PostGIS, and GDAL.
- Validation:
  - 33,107 validation points across the 21 classes; overall accuracy 83% (for LCM2023).
- Known method nuances:
  - LCM2023 methods differ slightly from prior years due to ongoing methodological improvements; cross-year changes may reflect both real change and methodological updates.

## Land cover class relationships and descriptions

- UKCEH Land Cover Classes (21 classes) are aligned with BAP Broad Habitats, with some explicit distinctions and occasional cross-references to BAP terminology.
- Appendices provide detailed definitions and relationships between UKCEH classes and BAP Broad Habitats, including notes on spectral confusion among certain habitats (e.g., various grasslands, bog, fen, heath, and water-related classes).

## Data products in depth

- 10 m Classified Pixels (GB and NI):
  - Two-band raster: class identifier and associated probability/confidence per pixel.
  - Maintains high detail (no generalisation by Land Parcel Spatial Framework) to preserve narrow features; validation earlier focused on the 25 m parcel raster product.
- Land Parcel Datasets:
  - Generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to create parcel attributes (Table 3 attributes; see documentation).
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels (GB and NI):
  - Rasterised from parcel boundaries with three bands: dominant class (_mode), mean confidence (_conf), and parcel purity (_purity).
- 1 km Summary Rasters (GB and NI):
  - Dominant class per 1 km pixel (1 band) and percentage cover by class (21-class and 10-class summaries).
  - Percentage values are integers; sums may deviate slightly from 100 due to rounding, especially near coastlines.
- Seasonal Composite Images:
  - Used to form Classification Scenes; bands from Sentinel-2 include a broad spectral range; minor data gaps are captured as nulls but do not impede full UK coverage.
- Context Rasters:
  - GB: 10 m context rasters include height, aspect, slope, distance to buildings/roads/tidal water/freshwater, foreshore mask, woodland mask, saltmarsh mask.
  - NI: 10 m context rasters include height, aspect, slope, urban mask, distance to coast/roads/freshwater, foreshore mask, tidal water mask.
- Classification Scenes:
  - GB classified in 32 tiles (100 x 100 km tiles, with some regional adjustments); NI uses a single classification scene for the full territory.
  - Each scene trained and classified independently to manage regional phenology and data volume.

## Validation, accuracy, and known issues

- Overall accuracy of LCM2023: 83% across 21 classes.
- Validation data sources: GB countryside survey, open data inventories, Rural Payments Agency data, bespoke validation points via image interpretation and field data.
- Known issues:
  - A small number of polygons missing from the vector land parcel products, resulting in nodata areas in the 25 m rasterised parcel dataset (negligible impact on 1 km products; 10 m pixels unaffected).
- Data citation:
  - Each LCM2023 dataset has a DOI; references include Marston et al. (2023, 2024) and companion papers documenting production methods and dataset specifics.
- Disclaimer:
  - Annual updates use evolving methods; changes between maps may reflect real change or methodological shifts.

## Using the data and visualization guidance

- Colour and symbology:
  - Appendix 5 and Appendix 6 provide recommended color schemes for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes, including color-blind friendly options.
  - QGIS symbology files are supplied (lcm_raster.qml and lcm_raster_cb_friendly.qml) to facilitate quick map creation.
- Citations and DOIs:
  - DOIs are assigned to each dataset; users should cite the corresponding dataset DOIs when distributing results.
