# Notes on the downloadable data

- The precise locations of Countryside Survey (CS) field survey squares are kept confidential by CEH to preserve representativeness of the wider countryside. External users cannot identify squares with precision finer than 100 square kilometres.

- CS Field Survey data are drawn from a sample of 1 km squares in Great Britain, with two levels of sampling: the whole square and within-square measurements. Data types range from binary to continuous (e.g., areas, lengths).

- The CS sample squares are not a random subset of all GB squares. It is a stratified sample defined by the ITE Land Classification, with country-specific classifications (England: 21 classes, Wales: 8, Scotland: 16) reflecting separate reporting needs.

- Not all GB squares were considered for field survey. Squares with more than 90% sea or more than 75% urban area were excluded. Consequently, official GB estimates are based on the included squares, with assumptions that excluded vegetative land is similar to surveyed land; regional biases are most likely when a region has a high proportion of sea or urban squares.

- Estimation approach: land-class estimates are produced using ratio estimates weighted by the vegetative land area in each class. Since 1998, standard errors and confidence intervals have been estimated using bootstrap methods to address skewness.

- Data availability and metadata: the process implies issues around data accessibility and metadata quality, which can affect verification and reuse. Public sharing of underlying datasets and appropriate data governance are important considerations.
