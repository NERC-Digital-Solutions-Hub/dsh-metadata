# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Purpose and context
- Outlines the field survey sampling framework used by Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Builds on the ITE (Institute of Terrestrial Ecology) Land Classification as the stratification system to ensure representative sampling and enable change detection over time.
- Emphasises compatibility with predecessors while recognizing the need for country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) after devolution.

## Core concept: stratified sampling with the ITE Land Classification
- Stratified, random sampling is used to reduce bias and ensure all ecosystem types are represented.
- The ITE Land Classification groups land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate).
- Early approach used a centre-square strategy within a 15 x 15 km grid to classify 1 km squares and to allocate sampling squares across classes.
- Sampling per class is designed to reflect the land area and ecological variability of each class.

## Timeline of major surveys and sampling frameworks

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and first field survey
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares classed as well).
  - 8 sample squares per class (total 256) across GB.
  - National habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square in each class multiplied by the class area.

- 1984 – Second field survey
  - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Used the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates; results published later.

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to classify all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - First integration with the Land Cover Map of GB; field data collection extended to include repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping.
  - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- 1998–2000 – Revised Land Classification and CS2000
  - Land Classification extended so every GB square could be classified; a new multivariate approach tested due to computing constraints.
  - For regional/local estimates, a broader, more representative classification was adopted; some original 1 km squares changed class, affecting the distribution of classes.
  - CS2000 introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) with class sub-division, aggregation where necessary, and additional squares to ensure adequate representation of all classes.
  - An uplands module was added to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats, funded by DETR, MAFF, and WO/CCW.
  - Wales received greater sampling emphasis to enable Wales-only reporting; Isle of Man squares were replaced when needed to align with country-based reporting.

- 2007 – CS2007 adjustments for Wales and reporting needs
  - Wales-specific refinements to support Wales-only environmental policy and legislation.
  - ITE Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions for England & Wales, creating 5 new Welsh/English classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increasing the total strata to 45.
  - Additional squares: 43 extra squares in Wales to ensure representation across new Welsh classes; some English classes (5e, 15e) reduced to 4 squares per class due to overall precision considerations.
  - England/Wales and Scotland continue to be reported with an emphasis on country-unit estimates.
  - Wales-specific uplands sampling maintained, with broader framework to support country-level environmental reporting.

## Country-specific reporting and sampling adjustments
- CS2000 introduced country-unit estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) to support country-level decision-making and policy needs.
- 2000 framework includes class sub-division and aggregation to produce 40 strata, with additional squares to ensure adequate representation across country units.
- 2007 framework further refines country-unit classifications and increases Welsh representation to support Wales-only reporting.

## Uplands module
- An additional sampling module for upland and marginal uplands was incorporated (CS2000) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas and ensure robust country-based statistics.

## Note on national estimates and classification consistency
- The 2006 scoping study highlighted that changing the underlying land classification for national estimates affects consistency across surveys.
- For internal consistency within a survey, using the latest classification per country is preferred; for cross-survey comparability, the original or consistent approach may be used.
- Table 4 in the document compares sample sizes across surveys using the original 1990 Land Classification, illustrating how changes in classification influence the sampling framework.

## Outputs and reporting
- Each survey produces a main report with methodology, maps, and tables detailing the sampling framework, class distributions, and country-specific estimates.
- The evolution of the sampling strategy is designed to support long-term monitoring of habitat areas and ecological change across GB, with increasing emphasis on England & Wales and Wales-specific reporting.

## Summary of the evolution (five key phases)
- 1978: 32 land classes; centre-square stratification; 256 samples; eight per class.
- 1984: Increased to 12 squares per class; 384 samples.
- 1990: All GB squares classified; 508 samples; linkage to Land Cover Map.
- 2000: Separate country estimates; 40 classes; additional samples; uplands module; Wales-focused sampling.
- 2007: Wales-specific country-unit classes; 45 strata; substantial Welsh sampling; maintained uplands module for improved country reporting.
