# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The document reviews three decades of development of the ITE Land Classification and how it underpins the Countryside Survey sampling framework, explaining why the current method is deeply linked to its predecessors.
- It emphasizes stratified, random sampling to ensure samples are representative and to enable robust national and regional estimates of habitat and land-use features.

## Core concepts and purpose

- Stratification (ITE Land Classification) is used to carve GB land into discrete, meaningful strata to sample within each class.
- The sampling unit is a 1 km square; classifications are derived from environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to ensure ecological differentiation.
- The approach combines objective random selection with stratification to reduce bias and improve precision of national and regional estimates.
- National estimates are computed by combining the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total area of that class.

## Timeline of development and application

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and first GB field survey
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to define 32 land classes from classified 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid).
  - Selected eight sample squares per class, totaling 256 squares, plus four surrounding squares per centre for context (6039 km² covered).
  - National estimates derived from the proportion of GB area in each class and the mean habitat area per square within each class.
- 1984 – Second GB field survey
  - Expanded sampling to 12 squares per class (total 384), still based on the 1978 Land Classification.
- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and third GB field survey
  - Refined to classify every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Introduced Land Cover Map linked to CS1990 data; results published using the updated framework.
- 1998 – Revised Land Classification and fourth field survey
  - Updated classification to allow Scotland-only reporting with a broader 40 Land Classes.
  - Recognized need for regional accuracy and urban/sea corrections; prepared for country-level estimates.
- 2000 – Developments for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Implemented separate country estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland) by subdividing Land Classes into country-unit versions and aggregating where necessary.
  - Added 19 extra squares to ensure representation of new classes; additional adjustments to achieve comparable sampling rates between England and Wales.
  - Included an upland habitats module to improve estimates in uplands of England and Wales.
- 2007 – Developments for Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting required further adjustments; created five new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Increased Wales sampling to ensure six squares per Welsh class; overall, 45 strata (up from 40).
  - England retained most classes but two English classes (5e, 15e) had only four squares due to precision considerations.
  - Wales-specific and England-wide mapping updated to reflect revised country-unit classifications.

## Sampling framework and sample sizes (by survey)

- 1978 (Initial): 256 sample squares (8 per Land Class) across 6039 km²; core method for national estimates.
- 1984 (Second survey): 384 squares (12 per class), continuing use of the 32-class framework.
- 1990 (All Squares classification): 508 squares; expansion to classify all GB squares; results linked to CS1990 report.
- 1998 (Revised classification): 569 squares surveyed; restored ability to report separately for Scotland; increased Land Classes to 40.
- 2000 (CS2000): substantial GB-wide sample with country-unit reporting; detailed country-specific class subdivisions and additional upland focus; total squares and distribution summarized in accompanying tables/maps.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-focused adjustments with 43 additional Welsh squares; five new Welsh sub-classes; total Wales representation increased; overall framework expanded to 45 strata.

## Separate country estimates and country-unit framework

- To support England & Wales vs Scotland reporting, Land Classes were subdivided into country-unit versions.
- Adjustments included class subdivision, aggregation when a country had few squares, and reallocation of additional squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes in each country.
- Isle of Man squares removed in favor of reallocation to maintain country-unit representation.

## Wales and uplands modules

- Wales required dedicated Wales-only planning and reporting support, leading to Wales-specific sub-classes and increased Welsh sampling.
- An uplands module added in CS2000 (and continued in CS2007) provided targeted sampling in upland and marginal upland areas to improve habitat estimates in those regions.

## Data handling, estimates, and comparability

- National estimates depend on the Land Classification in use; changing the classification across surveys affects consistency of stock estimates.
- For internal consistency within an individual survey, the latest classification is preferred; for cross-survey comparability, older classifications may be used.
- The document details how sample sizes, strata, and country-unit adjustments evolved to balance precision, representation, and policy/reporting needs.

## Practical implications for data-driven analysis

- The framework demonstrates how robust ecological estimates rely on a well-designed stratified sampling strategy anchored in an explicit environmental classification.
- It highlights the need to adapt sampling, classification, and reporting boundaries to changing policy needs (e.g., country-specific reporting) while maintaining methodological rigor.
- It underscores the importance of documenting classification changes, sampling adjustments, and the implications for trend analysis and comparability over time.
