# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Purpose and Context
- Documents the field survey sampling strategy and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to underpin Countryside Survey (CS) from its inception up to 2007.
- Aims to provide a robust, time-series data framework for estimating habitat areas and changes at national and country levels (England, Scotland, Wales), with later emphasis on Wales-specific reporting and upland habitats.
- Emphasizes the need for representative sampling through stratification and random selection to avoid bias and to enable valid policy-relevant estimates.

## Key Evolution of the Land Classification (1978–2007)
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification, 32 classes): Center squares of a 15x15 km grid identified 1,228 squares; 8 squares per class surveyed (total 256) to generate national estimates.
- 1984 (2nd Field Survey): Sample size increased by 50% (12 squares per class; 384 total); still based on the 1978 classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey): Classification updated to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; added land-cover data and urban/sea corrections; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey): Classification expanded to 40 classes to support Scotland reporting; 569 squares surveyed; began enabling country-specific estimates.
- 2000 (Countryside Survey CS2000): Further refinements for separate England/Wales reporting; 45 classes; sub-division and aggregation of classes to form 40 strata; additional squares (including upland focus) introduced to improve representation.
- 2007 (Countryside Survey CS2007): Wales-only reporting needs led to creating 5 Welsh-specific sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and 43 extra Welsh squares; overall framework expanded to 45 classes with 40 strata; upland habitat module added (30 extra squares) to boost upland estimates; adjustments kept England counts balanced.

## Sampling Framework and Estimation Method
- Core design: stratified, random sampling to ensure representativeness and minimize bias; strata defined by ITE Land Classes (country-unit versions introduced over time).
- Sample allocation and sizes:
  - 1978: 256 squares total (8 per class across 32 classes).
  - 1984: 384 squares (12 per class across 32 classes).
  - 1990: 508 squares (all GB squares classified; all features plus vegetation quadrats repeated).
  - 2000: 569 squares (CS2000 scale; 40 strata after country-specific adaptations).
  - 2007: 591 squares (CS2007; country-specific class subdivisions and additional Wales samples).
- National estimates concept: mean habitat area per square in each Land Class multiplied by the area of that class; results published in successive CS reports.
- Use of ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) and multivariate approaches to develop and refine the classification system, enabling consistent ecological stratification across surveys.

## Country Reporting and Wales/Upland Focus
- England, Scotland, Wales reporting evolved to support country-specific environmental policy needs.
- Wales required additional Welsh-class subdivisions and more Welsh samples to deliver Wales-only estimates with acceptable precision.
- England-Wales and Scotland reporting frameworks adapted through class subdivisions, aggregation where necessary, and targeted sampling (including uplands) to ensure robust estimates per country unit.
- Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates and replaced to maintain country-specific consistency.

## Upland Habitat Module and Data Quality Considerations
- CS2007 introduced an upland module (30 extra squares) to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Acknowledges that changes in Land Classification impact cross-survey comparability; prefers using the latest classification for GB-wide estimates while noting potential inconsistencies with earlier classifications.
- Tables and figures (e.g., sample counts per class, country-specific maps) illustrate how sampling and classification changes affected representation and precision over time.

## Summary and Implications for Data Leaders
- The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey presents a comprehensive, evolving framework designed to produce robust, time-series habitat data with country-specific reporting capabilities.
- Key strengths:
  - Stratified random sampling aligned with a detailed land classification system ensures representative coverage and meaningful trend analysis.
  - Clear methodology for estimating national and country-unit habitat areas from sample data.
  - Provisions for country-specific reporting (England/Wales, Scotland) and targeted upland habitat assessment.
- Key challenges:
  - Shifts in Land Classification across survey cycles can affect comparability; careful interpretation is required when linking estimates from different classifications.
  - Some land classes required additional sampling to achieve acceptable precision, particularly for Wales and upland areas.
- Practical takeaways for data strategy:
  - Maintain transparent documentation of classification changes and their impact on estimates.
  - Plan for country-unit and upland modules when governance or policy requires sub-national detail.
  - Ensure metadata, data discoverability, and update cycles align with the history of classification revisions to support repeatable, policy-relevant analyses.
