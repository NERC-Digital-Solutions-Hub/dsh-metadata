# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners, essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and continued permission to survey land.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Access may identify whether CS squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit precise locations may be provided only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; applicant must show legally that their IP data carries equal or higher confidentiality than CS data, preventing release to CEH for processing with CS data.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) could most easily identify a square; released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- At licence end, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No data or derivatives may be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; users should not attempt to derive precise locations or claim they did so.
- Location data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP) may be required.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the highest IP confidentiality level.

## Roles, processes and guidance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, with clauses reflecting this policy; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH will follow the Act and Regulations to support the decision.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS partnership use, CEH will aim to provide reasonable preprocessing support within moderate demand; other organisations’ requests are case-by-case.
- It is strongly recommended that potential data users consult with CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be optional (collaborative or paid) and negotiated case-by-case.
