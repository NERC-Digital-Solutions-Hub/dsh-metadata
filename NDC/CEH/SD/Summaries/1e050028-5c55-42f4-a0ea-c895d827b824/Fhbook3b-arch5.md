# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Purpose and scope
- Field handbook for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000), updating CS1990 to monitor land use, vegetation, and landscape changes across Britain.
- Uses a 1 x 1 km square sampling framework with time-series data to support national policy and biodiversity objectives.
- Emphasizes standardized field recording to enable reliable change detection and cross-year comparisons.

## Data governance, standards, and metadata
- Clear guidelines to standardize observer recording, terminology, and coding to minimize variation and bias.
- Extensive coding system for land cover, habitats, species, boundaries, buildings, and more; primary/secondary/universal codes.
- Embedded data management considerations: unique parcel numbers, CS1990 parcel codes, New Parcel Numbers for changes, and BAP mappings.
- Documentation and quality control are vital; field data must be complete, legible, and unambiguous for later analysis.
- FAB (Field Assessment Booklet) structure documents ownership, landowner interactions, physiography, vegetation, boundaries, infrastructure, and universal codes.

## Sampling framework and plots
- Core core-sample expanded from ~508 to a minimum of 568 squares; emphasis on upland and lowland representation.
- Country-specific reporting and strata (37 strata) with subdivisions and aggregations for representativeness.
- Additional sampling in uplands; planned future satellite/linkage integration (top-down vs bottom-up data).

## Planning, site visits, and logistics
- Six survey teams; typical square requires about four survey days.
- Flexible scheduling and planning; efficiency and consistency prioritized; new squares surveyed near neighbors; old squares replicated survey order.

## Equipment and field tools
- Comprehensive equipment provisioning including safety gear, FABs, maps, GPS, cameras, marker plates, etc.
- Clear responsibilities for equipment upkeep and reporting damages before replacements.

## Data recording and the Field Assessment Booklet (FAB)
- FAB consolidates square data: ownership/landowner info, physiography, water features, vegetation, forestry, boundaries, buildings/roads/recreation, and codes.
- Emphasis on neat, legible FAB completion; documentation of sequence, dominant cover, and when multiple codes apply.
- Special notes guide handling of bracken, mosaics, species combinations, and bryophyte/lichen lists.

## Mapping, coding, and data integration
- Mapping in CS1990-derived methodology: structured alpha-numeric codes on 1:10,000 maps; emphasis on primary vs secondary codes; minimum mapping units; boundary delineation; historical vs new mapping.
- Aerial photography guidance exists but ground truthing takes precedence.
- Change mapping in old squares emphasizes change detection; introduces Mappable BAPs and Plottable BAPs for upland vs lowland landscapes.
- Ponds and water features captured; pond data linked to prior surveys for comparison.

## Plots, sampling design, and relocation
- X plots: five large 200 m2 anchor plots per square with nested 4 m2 inner plots for species presence/cover.
- Y plots: five 2 m x 2 m plots for semi-natural habitats; new baselines in new squares; relocation guidelines.
- U plots: 2 x 2 m unenclosed plots; proportional to plottable area.
- B plots: five 200 m2 plots at field boundaries; vegetation changes recorded alongside.
- A plots: 100 x 1 m arable field-margin plots; monitor arable weed communities.
- H plots: two linear hedgerow plots per square; woody species recording; relocation similar to X plots.
- D plots: up to 10 plots across hedgerows to quantify woody diversity and rarer taxa.
- S & W plots: five plots per square (two streamside, three waterside) for varied water-related habitats.
- R & V plots: five roadside/verge plots to capture roadside vegetation, categorized by road type.
- Plot relocation in old squares uses metal plates and field notes; permanency markers and GPS coordinates recorded; photographs taken for each plot.

## Data quality, change detection, and reliability
- Emphasizes observer training and QA to ensure cross-year consistency.
- Complex change-detection framework with rules for re-numbering, splitting, merging, or replacing features.
- Distinguishes Mappable BAPs (woodland/boundaries) from Plottable BAPs (agriculture, hedgerows, streams) for upland vs lowland contexts.
- Provisions for documenting atypical land-use changes with notes on FABs and maps.

## GPS, location data, and annexes
- Annex 1 provides extensive guidance for GPS data collection to improve plotting and relocation accuracy from 1998 onward.
- Includes steps for device setup, stationary vs moving logging, file naming conventions, data rates, and plotting.
- Emphasizes PDOP, satellite availability, obstructions, almanac updates, and data quality checks.
- Provides tips for using GPS apparatus and data entry through the Magellan keypad.

## Sampling methods (Section 10)
- Three sampling types: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling.
- Soil sampling: five replicate soil samples per 1 km square X-plot; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing; standardized collection protocol with labeled bags and specific pipe sizes.
- Calluna sampling: collection of current year growth (CYG) from Calluna vulgaris to assess foliar nitrogen for deposition studies; standardized labeling and postage procedures to ITE Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling: coordinated with accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff; synchronized with CS2000 field activities.

## Photography (Section 11)
- One camera per team; film stock provided; photos of every vegetation plot to document appearance and landmarks.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and visible in future visits.
- Photos must include square/plot identifiers on a plastic board placed at the plot edge; composition guidelines emphasize framing the plot with reference features.

## Procedures after survey (Section 12)
- End-of-day data checks to ensure no omissions.
- Data may be transposed to fresh maps/forms only if essential; otherwise, avoid re-entry.
- FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE stations promptly.
