COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Introduction and purpose
- Large field teams introduce variation despite training and QA. 
- QA assessed consistency and reliability across major field components in a sample of squares from the Countryside 2000 survey.
- Resurvey of 38 squares (one quarter per square) covering 234 species plots across nine plot types; comparison between CS2000 surveyors and QA assessors.

## Aims
- Quantify field recording accuracy and change statistics.
- Examine plot relocation efficiency and observer-related bias.
- Explain recording differences in terms of location/orientation, management, and season.
- Relate CS2000 findings to the CS1990 benchmark.
- Assess landcover mapping accuracy and boundary features; evaluate change recording.

## Methods and scope
- Sampling: 38 of 519 squares; 234 species plots across plot types; 177 change-related instances sampled for landcover changes.
- Plot types: quadrats and linear plots across road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, etc.
- Relocation: locating buried plates marked in 1990; assessors used sketch maps, photos, and detectors; categories of relocation success defined.
- Data used: comparison of CS2000 survey data with QA data on species presence/absence, cover estimates, landcover codes, boundary features, and hedges.

## Key findings

### Plot relocation and plate recovery
- Of 210 plots with full search, 86.7% were satisfactorily relocated.
- Surveyors: 60% accurately relocated; ~25% relocated approximate; ~15% not adequately relocated.
- QA assessors achieved higher relocation success (about 87% adequately relocated in CS1991 comparison; CS2000 effort comparable to CS1990).
- Plate recovery by assessors: 69.3% of plates located; overall estimated total recovery possibly 40–45% when counting all relocation categories.
- Several relocation errors occurred (e.g., wrong bank/side of boundary); some new plates were created due to relocation difficulties.

### Species concordance and recording accuracy
- Mean species per plot: CS2000 = 17.9; QA = 20.4 (QA tended to produce longer species lists).
- Initial recording accuracy (presence/absence) around 73% for CS2000 vs QA, slightly lower than CS1990 but reconcilable when accounting for plot relocation issues.
- About 26.9% of total species mismatches; main contributors:
  - Overlooked species: ~39.8% of TI mismatches; mis-location/orientation also a meaningful portion.
  - Mis-identifications and box-ticking errors also present, with grasses and common species contributing notably to mismatches.
- Across species frequencies, QA often recorded more species than CS2000; rank order of common species broadly similar but with notable discrepancies for certain grasses and herbs.

### Vegetation cover comparisons
- Visual cover estimates for species >5% were generally in agreement, but several species showed significant differences (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
- Overall cover concordance for principal species across CS2000 vs QA was variable; some species showed statistically significant differences in mean cover.

### Change in frequency of prevalent species and ordination
- Frequencies and rank orders of common species generally aligned, though with differences linked to seasonality and plot relocation.
- DECORANA ordination (axis 1) showed no directional bias between CS2000 and QA when pooling plot types; mean axis scores were not significantly different (p = 0.741).
- Axis-score changes varied by plot type and landclass, with location/orientation and cover mis-matches among principal causes of discrepancies.

### Landcover mapping and boundary coding
- Primary landcover codes: high concordance between CS2000 and QA; overall primary land cover agreement ~87.5% (excluding BAP codes); when considering primary codes alone, concordance ~91.6%.
- BAP codes (broad habitat types) had lower concordance (~77.4%), indicating more difficulty in matching broader habitat classifications.
- Primary boundary codes: very high concordance overall (~92% code concordance; total boundary concordance ~85%).
- Boundary features (height, stockproof status) showed substantial agreement; hedge shape coding saw more omissions and some inconsistencies.
- Change in landuse codes: concordance on changes was relatively low (overall change concurrence ~51.4%); many changes observed by CS2000 were not noted or substantiated by QA assessors, suggesting under-recording of landscape change.

### Hedge diversity and arable plots
- Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species 124; common species 92; agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%; mean species per hedge plot ~5.16 (CS2000) vs 5.89 (QA).
- Arable plots (5 plots): concordance extremely poor; results highly season-dependent; two visits per plot recommended for future work to improve reliability.

### Overall interpretation of data quality
- Major data-quality drivers include plot location/orientation errors and variation in species recording and cover estimation.
- Mapping and boundary coding were relatively robust, while change detection methods showed notable gaps.
- There is a clear pattern: QA often finds more species and occasionally different habitat classifications, reflecting both true ecological change and methodological differences.

## Implications for data strategy and governance (Data Leaders perspective)
- Data collection in large-field surveys benefits from robust location accuracy and explicit plotting protocols; mis-location/orientation is a key risk to data integrity.
- Stronger emphasis on standardized coding schemes, metadata, and change-tracking to support reliable temporal comparisons.
- Landcover mapping is generally reliable, but broader habitat classifications (BAP and similar schemes) require clearer definitions and validation.
- Change detection requires explicit procedures for recording, verifying, and integrating changes, with safeguards to avoid under-recording.
- Arable/marginal plots may need more intensive sampling or repeat visits to achieve acceptable reliability.
- The QA framework demonstrates how cross-checks (re-surveys, independent assessors) enable measurement of data quality across data products, informing governance decisions and improvement actions.

## Practical takeaways for data leadership
- Invest in robust field protocols and marker systems to improve plot relocation success and reduce orientation errors.
- Implement and maintain detailed metadata for plots, plates, and boundary features to support reproducibility.
- Use QA sampling strategically to monitor data quality across data products (species lists, cover estimates, landcover, boundaries, and change).
- Plan for periodic re-surveys or multiple visits for complex plot types (e.g., arable margins) to improve reliability.
- Prioritize clearer, standardized coding for landcover and boundary features; provide ongoing training to reduce misclassifications and omissions.
- Ensure change data are captured with explicit justification and cross-validated by independent reviewers to enhance trend analyses.
