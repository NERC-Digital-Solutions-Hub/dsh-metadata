# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Field handbook for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) establishing standardized, time-series environmental monitoring.
  - Builds on CS1990 to capture land cover, vegetation data, and landscape features for policy-relevant monitoring.
  - Aims for current, comparable datasets to support biodiversity, habitat, and land-use indicators and to link ground-truth with remote-sensing approaches.

- Sampling framework and data types
  - Three main sampling streams: soil sampling, Calluna vulgaris sampling, and freshwater biota sampling.
  - Soil sampling focuses on chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiological status; Calluna sampling supports nitrogen deposition analyses; freshwater sampling conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff.
  - Samples collected from squares used in the 1978 survey for national spatial representativeness; coordination between CS2000 field teams, ITE Merlewood, and IFE staff.

- Soil sampling (procedure and aims)
  - Five replicate soil samples per square for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), fauna diversity, and microbiology; processed at ITE Merlewood.
  - In each X-plot within a square, three cores are taken using specified pipe lengths, with fast turnaround for short-lived analyses.
  - Detailed field procedure ensures consistent sampling location (center plot) and systematic replication across centre plots.

- Calluna sampling (procedure and aims)
  - Collect within every 1 km square containing Calluna vulgaris, from current year's growth (CYG) shoots.
  - Gather 30–50 g fresh weight from randomly selected plants; properly bagged and labeled for dispatch to ITE Merlewood.

- Freshwater sampling
  - Conducted by IFE staff; coordinated with CS2000 field teams to integrate timing and locations within squares.

- Equipment, logistics, and permissions
  - Comprehensive field equipment provided (e.g., cool box, trowel, knives, measuring tools, aluminum plates, pipes, end caps).
  - Packaging and shipping processes include labeled envelopes, pre-assembled bags, and traceable square/plot identifiers to ensure chain-of-custody.
  - Landowner permissions required; field teams follow procedures for access, with options for partial or refused access to portions of a square.

- Data collection, forms, and mapping
  - Data collection relies on Field Assessment Books (FABs) and standardized forms; strict documentation and labeling to maintain consistency across observers and squares.
  - GPS and mapping procedures outlined to link field observations with spatial data; emphasis on relocation accuracy and data integrity.

- Photography
  - One camera per team; use of print film to photograph every vegetation plot.
  - Photographs should clearly show plot position and landmarks, with a reference board displaying square and plot numbers; composition prioritizes clear, landmarked views.

- Procedures after survey
  - Post-survey data verification: review data sheets to ensure completeness and accuracy.
  - Return FABs and samples promptly to ITE stations to maintain data integrity and timely processing.

- Annex: Collecting GPS data
  - Step-by-step guidance for ensuring GPS readiness (power, satellites, PDOP, almanac updates).
  - Procedures for recording stationary (plots) and moving (boundaries) features; unique file naming for each plot/feature (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to enable precise data tracking.
  - Recommendations for reducing errors (PDOP < 6, addressing obstructions with antenna extensions, battery management, and proper logging controls).

- Attribute references and coding
  - Detailed attribute reference lists and sheets to quickly select plot identifiers and feature codes, supporting standardized coding of plots, boundaries, and vegetation features.
