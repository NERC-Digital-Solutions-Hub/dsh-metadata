# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Current Countryside Survey partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- The Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Preserve scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports continued ability to inform environmental policy.

## Release levels and circumstances
- Licences may release four-digit grid references (identifying the 10x10 km square) under licence.
- Precise six-digit grid references are only for VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release where possible.
- Spatial data within survey squares are treated equivalently to location data and may be released under the same exceptional terms.

## Conditions of release and use
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained after the project ends.
- Licensees must confirm destruction of data at project end.
- No release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; seek CEH advice if unsure.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowners’ compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have looser IP requirements than six-digit releases and must not be used to deduce precise locations.

## Governance, responsibilities, and process
- Decisions on exceptional release are made by CEH on behalf of NERC, applying policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences, signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee.
- If access is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case basis for external requests.
- Partners are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
