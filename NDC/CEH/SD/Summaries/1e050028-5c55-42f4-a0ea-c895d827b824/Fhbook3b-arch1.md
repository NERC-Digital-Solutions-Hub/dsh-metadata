# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- The CS2000 Field Handbook provides standardized, repeatable methodologies for sampling, mapping, and monitoring land use, habitats, and vegetation across Britain to enable robust time-series analyses and policy-relevant indicators.
- Emphasizes integration of ground-truth field surveys with broad land-cover classifications, strong data quality, metadata, and cross-year comparability.
- Outlines sampling design, plot types, data collection tools, permissions, data recording, data quality, and practical logistics, as well as post-survey procedures and supplementary GPS guidance.

## Sampling framework and data collection

- Time-series focus: continuation of CS1990 baseline with expanded sampling in CS2000.
- Core sampling units: 1 x 1 km squares across England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man; 568 CS2000 squares plus 508 from CS1990.
- Organization: six teams (approx. 95 squares each); potential expansion for upland coverage; country-level reporting for Scotland vs England/Wales.
- Data types collected per square:
  - Vegetation and habitat mapping
  - 200-species plant list; mosses/lichens with specified lists
  - Plot relocation marks and detailed change logging
- Plot and habitat framework:
  - Broad habitat categories with two-tier approach (mappable vs. plottable) to align with Biodiversity Action Plans
  - Changes tracked through parcel codes and new identifiers to support longitudinal comparison

## Plot types and vegetation data

- Plot families within each square include X (large), Y (small/targeted), U (unopened/unenclosed), B (boundary), A (arable margin), H (hedgerow), D (hedgerow diversity), S/W (streamside/roadside) and R/V (roadside/verge) plots.
- Detailed relocation and permanence procedures: metal plates, GPS relocation, and standardized plotting layouts.
- Vegetation data collection:
  - Fixed 200-species list; allowances for taxonomic ambiguity
  - Mosses/lichens documented with dedicated codes
  - Plot relocation plans and on-site documentation to enable precise re-establishment

## Soil, Calluna, and freshwater sampling procedures

- Soil sampling (CS2000 objective): five replicate samples per square square set including soil chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and soil microbiological status.
- Sampling per X-plot:
  - Three cores collected per square: one long black pipe and two short white pipes, all from ~15 cm north/east/west of the centre plot, to a depth >5 cm
  - Shorter pipes processed quickly (short shelf-life) and mailed to ITE Merlewood; longer pipe collected by regional coordinators
  - Samples packaged in labeled envelopes and posted; rapid transport to Merlewood for analysis
- Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling (soil deposition/nitrogen study):
  - Samples collected in every 1 km square where Calluna occurs
  - Current year growth shoots (CYG) collected, 30–50 g fresh weight
  - Samples sealed, labeled, and posted to ITE Merlewood; despatch coordinated via station reporting or direct posting
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff; coordination with CS2000 coordinators to align timing

## Data recording, mapping, and management

- Data capture tools:
  - Field Assessment Books (FABs) for mapping, ownership, vegetation, and observations
  - 6" or 1:10,000 scale mapping; emphasis on change detection and new parcel coding
  - Aerial imagery used as guidance; ground truth remains authoritative
- Data standardization and QA:
  - Emphasis on observer training, documentation of metadata, and procedures to distinguish genuine change from recording error
  - Cross-year reliability checks and notes to qualify changes
- Data provenance and discoverability:
  - Datasets are intended to be discoverable with metadata; datasets and outputs are prepared for portal upload
- Taxonomic and biotic detail:
  - 200-species vegetation list; bryophytes/lichens recorded with specified conventions
  - Extensive coding schemes for parcels, habitats, and plots to support detailed change logging

## Photography and post-survey procedures

- Photography:
  - One camera per team; film stock allocated; photograph every vegetation plot
  - Reference features must be obvious, permanent, and within view; square and plot numbers must be visible on a board in each photo
  - Framing guidance aims for clear depiction of plot context without excessive sky
- Post-survey procedures:
  - Daily checks to ensure no features are omitted; data sheets may be transcribed only in exceptional circumstances
  - FABs and samples transported back to ITE stations promptly

## Annex: GPS data collection guidance

- GPS data collection procedures cover preparation, satellite checks, and data logging:
  - Ensure at least four satellites with PDOP ideally below 6 for 3D fixes
  - Stationary positioning (plots) vs moving positioning (new upland boundaries)
  - File naming conventions require square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE) with provisions for new features
  - Detailed steps for starting/stopping logging, data rate settings, and attribute selection
- Practical notes:
  - Battery management, almanac updates, obstruction considerations, and best practices for obtaining accurate readings
  - Use of Magellan keypad and error-handling in data entry
  - Guidance on securing GPS gear and ensuring data integrity during fieldwork

## Data handling expectations and challenges

- Data integration and standardization across diverse data streams (soil, flora, fauna, freshwater, GPS, imagery)
- Managing right-scale data and local- level detail while coordinating multiple teams and data streams
- Ensuring timely sample transport, data provenance, and adherence to QA processes
- IT and logistical considerations (equipment, software compatibility, admin rights) affecting field operations and data processing
