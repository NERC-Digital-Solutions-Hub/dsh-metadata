# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose of QA
  - Assess consistency and reliability of the CS2000 field programme across major components (plot relocation, species recording, vegetation cover, landcover mapping, and change assessment).
  - Quantify accuracy of field recording and relate findings to earlier CS1990/1991 QA results.

- Aims
  - Quantify accuracy of field recording in CS2000 and comment on change statistics.
  - Examine efficiency of plot relocation and identify observer effects, plot type, management, and seasonal influences.
  - Compare CS2000 findings with the CS1990 benchmark and interpret differences.

## Methods and Scope

- Sample and design
  - 38 of 519 squares from 1998 were selected; one quarter of each square rerecorded across 234 species plots in nine plot types.
  - Protocols for locating plots and mapping land cover referenced Annex A/B; seven plot types subdivided into quadrats and linear plots (e.g., road verges, streamsides, boundaries, hedges, arable margins).
- Plate/plot relocation
  - Assessed ability to relocate buried markers eight years after initial burying; used original sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors.
- Data elements examined
  - Plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, accuracy of percent cover for principal species.
  - Direction of vegetation change and potential directional bias via DECORANA ordination.
  - Landcover mapping: primary codes, descriptive/cover codes, BAP codes.
  - Change in landuse codes (since 1990) and accuracy of recorded changes.
  - Hedge/dominant boundary properties, hedge diversity, and boundary conditions.
- Annexes
  - Annex B provides square-by-square efficiency data; Annex A outlines QA protocol.

## Key Findings

- Plot relocation efficiency
  - Within 210 plots, 86.7% could be satisfactorily relocated.
  - CS2000 field staff: ~60% of plots relocated exactly; ~25% relocated with acceptable accuracy; ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - Plates: assessors located 69.3% of plates; total recovery (plates+plots) potentially 40–45% (surveyors’ relocation to identical positions and plate reuse varied).
  - Compared with CS1990 QA (87.1% exact relocation), eight years on relocation remains feasible but with notable challenges; some relocation errors occurred (e.g., wrong side of stream, hedge vs. boundary).

- Species concordance and recording accuracy
  - About 71% of records were confirmed as present by assessors; ~2% attributed to real management/seasonal changes.
  - Overall initial recording accuracy estimated at ~73%, with the difference largely explained by plot relocation errors.
  - QA revealed that the same assessors used in 1991 QA produced similar improvement/mismatch patterns in 1998 QA.

- Vegetation cover and species frequency
  - For the 30 most frequent species, several discrepancies between CS2000 and QA cover levels existed, notably for six grasses (seasonal effects likely contributing).
  - The QA often produced longer species lists per plot; increases over CS2000 were similar to prior QA (CS1990 vs CS1991).
  - Cover values showed mixed levels of agreement by species; some grasses showed significant differences in mean cover between surveyors and assessors, while many herb species agreements were reasonable.

- Change direction and axis scores (DECORANA)
  - No significant overall directional bias between CS2000 and QA axis scores.
  - Mean axis 1 scores were very close (CS2000: 387.8; QA: 392.0); ANOVA p = 0.741.
  - By plot type and landclass, most changes did not show consistent directional bias; discrepancies largely tied to plot location/orientation and cover mis-matches.

- Landcover mapping and coding concordance
  - Primary landcover codes: overall concordance excluding BAPs 91.6%; BAP codes 77.4%; overall primary land cover agreement 87.5%.
  - Landcover mapping codes (primary, boundary, and qualifying) showed strong agreement for primary and boundary features; some mis-matches occurred in more detailed or boundary-related codes.
  - For landuse primary codes, the 1990 QA concordance was 75.0%; for 1998 QA it was 73.1% (reflecting added complexity in 1998 coding).

- Hedge boundaries and hedge diversity
  - Hedge diversity plots (H plots) showed higher total species recorded by assessors (14.1% more than CS2000 surveyors); however, hedge surveys were occasionally treated as afterthought, leading to overlooked species.
  - Total hedge species recorded: 124; common species 92; agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
  - Mean number of species per hedge plot: CS2000 5.16 vs QA 5.89.

- Arable margin plots
  - Limited data (five plots); concordance very poor (30.6%) likely affected by seasonality and familiarity with ruderal/arable species.
  - Recommendation: plan multiple visits (at least two) to future arable margin plots.

- Change in landuse codes
  - Overall concordance for change: 51.4% (change noted by CS2000 33.9%; change recorded but not substantiated by assessors 14.7%).
  - Substantial portion of changes since 1990 likely missed or mis-coded; indicates that plot data remain essential for evaluating change, with a need for improved change-coding and interpretation.

- Overall assessment and comparisons
  - Across plot types, the combination of relocation errors, species mis-identifications, and variations in cover assignment accounted for much of the observed mismatches.
  - The QA confirms CS2000 data are broadly reliable for mapping and change assessment, but improvements are needed in relocation practices, metadata, and capture of change events.

## Practical Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- Data quality and governance
  - Ensure robust, consistent relocation procedures and documentation to minimize plot misplacement.
  - Improve metadata capture at the data origin to facilitate verification and reuse.
  - Public data sharing is valuable but may require balancing openness with sensitive information or data access barriers.

- Data integration and storytelling
  - Maintain clear, auditable lineage from field collection to analysis outputs (e.g., concordance vs. efficiency metrics).
  - Provide transparent accounting of change detection limitations and potential mis-codings to support policy evaluation.

- Mapping and coding consistency
  - Strengthen training and QA for landcover and boundary coding; ensure alignment with updated BAP classifications and boundary definitions.
  - Invest in consistent interpretation criteria for hedge and boundary conditions to reduce code-for-code mismatches.

- Resource planning for future surveys
  - Allocate sufficient visits and inspection time for arable margins and other complex habitats where mis-recording is more likely.
  - Consider iterative QA cycles to monitor improvements in relocation, species identification, and change coding over time.

- Data accessibility and openness
  - Ensure QA findings and concordance metrics are documented and publicly accessible to support governance, verification, and adaptive management.
