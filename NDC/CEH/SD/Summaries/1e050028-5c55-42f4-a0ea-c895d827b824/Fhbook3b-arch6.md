# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- The document provides standardized methodologies for field data collection used in CS2000, including vegetation overviews, soil and Calluna sampling, freshwater sampling coordination, GPS data collection, photography, and post-survey data handling to support national biodiversity indicators.

## Data coding and taxonomic standardisation

- Extensive, standardised species coding for plants (vascular plants, forbs, grasses) and bryophytes/lichens.
- Use of a top-200 species list for consistent data entry; rules for bracken and woody species; guidance on aggregations when exact identifications are difficult.
- Section covers both field codes and their mapped or plotted representations to support data interoperability.

## Data types and core outputs

- Three core data elements emerging in CS2000:
  - Mapping: standardized codes on enlarged 1:10,000 maps; de novo mapping in new squares and change mapping in existing squares.
  - Vegetation plots: detailed species lists, cover estimates (5% increments), and nested subplots for structure and composition.
  - Sampling: systematic sampling across plot types to quantify habitat and vegetation patterns.
- Additional outputs include change detection and alignment with biodiversity action plans (BAPs).

## Soil sampling (Section 10.7 and related)

- Purpose: national, spatially referenced soil baseline data to support soil sustainability indices (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals, soil biota).
- In each 1 km square: five replicate soil samples (three cores per square), taken at specified centre-plot locations in X-plots.
- Sampling equipment and packaging:
  - Use long black pipe for the first core; two short white pipes for additional cores; labelled bags and envelopes prepared with square and X-plot identifiers.
  - Samples posted to ITE Merlewood; shorter pipes sent by First Class post; longer pipes kept for collection by regional coordinators.
- Detailed field procedure:
  - Identify centre plot, locate sampling points 15 cm north and east/west of the centre, collect cores to >5 cm depth, cap pipes, label and bag contents, and post as required.
  - Maintain rapid handling for short-life samples (soil fauna and microbiology) and secure storage in a cool box until collection.
- Data integrity: meticulous labeling, separate envelopes per square/plot, and explicit notes for any deviations during sampling.

## Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling (Section 10.9)

- Objective: assess foliar nitrogen concentrations across GB to relate to nitrogen deposition and potential critical loads.
- In each square with Calluna vulgaris:
  - Collect current year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants; random selection.
  - Properly bag, seal with provided labels, and despatch to ITE Merlewood, either via research station or post.
  - Allow samples to dry if very wet before sealing.

## Freshwater sampling coordination (Section 10.11)

- Freshwater biota sampling is conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff in coordination with CS2000 field surveyors.
- Scheduling and liaison with CS2000 coordinators to arrange suitable times within squares.

## Photography and documentation (Section 11)

- One camera per team; use print film to photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and positional context.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and within view; photos must include square/plot identifiers on a marker board.
- Composition guidelines emphasize plot-dominant framing with clear reference points and minimal sky in frame.
- Examples of proper/poor photography practices are provided during training.

## Procedures after survey (Section 12)

- Post-fieldwork checks: review data sheets to ensure no features are missing; avoid transcription unless necessary due to damage.
- Transport FABs (field assessment books) and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

## GPS data collection and annex (Annex/Section on GPS data)

- Step-by-step procedure for recording GPS data:
  - Ensure device power, satellite lock (minimum four satellites; PDOP ideally below 6).
  - Record stationary plots (center plots) and moving features (boundaries) with defined start/stop rules.
  - Create unique data file names using square number and plot/feature identifiers (e.g., 501X4.PSE).
  - Set data sampling rate (1-second), tag plots/features with correct identifiers, and monitor logging status.
  - Stop logging and power down correctly; charge batteries as needed; manage almanac updates automatically.
  - Address potential obstructions by elevating the aerial if necessary.
- Attribute reference sheets and quick-key access:
  - Predefined shortcut numbers allow rapid selection of plot IDs (to streamline field entry).
  - Emphasis on clear naming and cross-referencing between GPS files and FABs.

## Data quality, navigation, and management

- Strong emphasis on data integrity, standardisation, and traceability across observers and time.
- Annexes provide GPS data collection guidelines and notes to support data integration and subsequent analyses.
- The handbook aims to ensure data generated are suitable for national indicators, biodiversity targets, and policy-relevant reporting.
