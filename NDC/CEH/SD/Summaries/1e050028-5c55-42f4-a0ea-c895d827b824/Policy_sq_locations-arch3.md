# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy aims to maximise the public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. It specifically covers survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include CEH (NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

## Confidentiality rationale and scope
- Survey square locations are kept confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Maintaining confidentiality is essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and ongoing permissions to survey land.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release levels
- Location data can be used to identify whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when approximate locations suffice.
- Six-digit grid references require CEH to perform pre-processing analysis to avoid release; in very exceptional cases, external release under licence may be permitted if the requester demonstrates IP confidentiality at least equal to or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares could indirectly reveal square locations and is therefore subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit coordinates.

## Licensing terms and obligations
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end of the licensing period.
- Data must not be released to third parties in ways that could compromise confidentiality, nor used to plan visits to CS squares or to monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit grid references licences have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases, but still prohibit attempts to deduce exact square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licence approvals/denials follow statutory Act and Regulations; CEH provides annual reports summarising licence applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS partner use; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, depending on the arrangement.

## Implementation guidance for organisations
- Internal data use should be facilitated by CEH to enable necessary pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe.
- External requests require case-by-case consideration; consult CEH to define requirements and ensure appropriate data use.

## Implications for monitoring framework design
- Demonstrates how to balance data utility with confidentiality, informing data governance approaches in monitoring frameworks.
- Highlights the need for structured access controls, licensing mechanisms, data retention and destruction, and clear conditions to prevent misuse or inadvertent disclosure.
- Emphasises the role of pre-processing and data provenance in enabling safe data sharing while protecting sampling integrity and landowner relationships.
