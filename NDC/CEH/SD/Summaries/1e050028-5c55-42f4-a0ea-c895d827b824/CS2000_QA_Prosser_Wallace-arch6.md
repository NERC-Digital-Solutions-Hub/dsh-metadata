# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- A comprehensive QA assessment of the Countryside Survey 2000 fieldwork to measure consistency and reliability across plot relocation, species recording, vegetation cover, land-use mapping, and change reporting.
- Focus on understanding data quality and guiding interpretation of CS2000 outputs for subsequent analysis and data use.

## Overview and Aims

- Recognize inherent variation in large field surveys despite training and QC.
- Quantify accuracy of field recording and change statistics.
- Assess efficiency of plot relocation and relocation of reference markers.
- Examine observer bias, plot location/orientation effects, plot type differences, management/season effects.
- Relate QA findings to the 1990 CS survey for context.
- Provide an objective basis for improving data creation and sharing, including mapping and change data.

## Methods and Scope of QA Exercise

- Sample: 38 of 519 CS2000 squares; within each, one quarter resurveyed (234 species plots across 9 plot types).
- Relation to CS1990: 34 of the squares had been included in the 1990 sub-sample; protocol aligns with Annex references.
- Plot types: Quadrats and linear plots (including road verges, streamsides, hedges/boundaries, arable margins, arable plots, etc.).
- Plate/plot relocation: Buried plates marking quadrats sought eight years after burial; comparison with 1990 QA/1991 QA exercises.
- Data elements evaluated: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, accuracy of percentage cover, direction of vegetation change, land-cover mapping, and change recording.

## Key Findings

### Plot Relocation and Plate Recovery

- Overall plate and plot recovery: 86.7% of full searches successfully relocated plots.
- Eight-year relocation performance for CS2000 vs 1990: CS2000 surveyors relocated 60% of 1990 plots exactly; ~25% relocated approximately; ~15% inadequately relocated. Small 4 m Habitat (Y) plots had higher failure (23%).
- QA team performance (for comparison): 69.3% of plates located; 60–65% overall effective relocation; about 40–45% potential total recovery when including best-case scenarios.
- Conclusion: Eight years on, it remains feasible to relocate but surveyors’ relocation was less thorough than QA; new plates were often used, complicating future relocations.

### Species Concordance and Recording Accuracy

- Across ~6000 records in 210 plots, 71% of records were confirmed by QA as present; 2% were due to real management/seasonal changes between original survey and QA.
- Initial recording accuracy estimated at ~73%, close to the 1990 CS survey, with the residual difference largely due to plot location errors in 1990–1998 comparisons.
- QA-identified mis-matches and reasons (types 1–9): mis-identifications, box-ticking errors, overlooked species, over-zealous recording, orientation/location errors, and occasional “mysteries.” Over 39.8% of TI (Time 1) errors were “Overlooked.” Orientation/location errors and mis-location accounted for notable portions of non-concordances.
- Overall, the QA indicates similar efficiency in 1990 and 1998 survey teams, suggesting consistent search efficiency across periods.

### Vegetation Cover Estimates

- Visual cover estimates (>5% within plots) were compared between CS2000 and QA.
- Overall mean cover values showed substantial concordance, though certain species exhibited significant differences (e.g., Holcus lanatus and Dactylis glomerata showed notable differences in mean cover; some differences likely seasonal).
- For several grasses and forbs, cover agreement varied; some species had lower concordance (notably Lolium perenne and several grasses) while others aligned well.
- Result: General agreement in cover values, with some species-specific or season-driven discrepancies.

### Change Direction and DECORANA Ordination

- DECORANA axis 1 changes examined to detect directional bias in change data.
- No significant directional bias detected between CS2000 and QA overall or by plot type/land class.
- Axis scores for CS2000 vs QA showed no significant mean difference; variation in axis scores often related to plot location/orientation or cover-value disagreements rather than systematic bias.

### Land-Cover Mapping and Boundary Features

- Land-cover coding categorized into primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes; boundary features included primary boundary codes and qualifiers.
- Primary land-cover concordance: high overall; excluding BAP (Broad Habitat) codes, concordance ~91.6%; including BAP codes, ~87.5%.
- BAP codes alone showed moderate concordance (~77.4%), reflecting complexities in broad habitat delineation.
- 1990 vs 1998 comparison for primary land-cover and BAP: overall improvement in primary code concordance; changes in BAP categorization noted as a factor.
- Change in land-use codes: concordance in assigning change relatively low (overall change concurrence ~51.4%; ~33.9% change not noted by CS2000; ~14.7% change recorded but not substantiated by assessors).
- Implication: mapping accuracy is strong for discrete land-cover categories, but recording change and BAP boundaries require careful cross-checking and may be prone to under-reporting or misclassification.

### Boundary Qualifiers and Hedge/Walls

- Primary boundary features: high concordance (total concordance ~85.0%; code concordance ~92.0%); occasional misclassification of hedge/wall types (e.g., 323 mixed hedge vs 321 hawthorn hedge).
- Boundary shape, height, and stockproof status: boundary height coded efficiently; stockproof status relatively consistent between surveyors and assessors (code concordance ~89.4%).
- Hedge shape coding (new hedge codes 374–380) had limited success; many hedges were captured by code 374 (box-shaped hedge) or omitted entirely.
- Overall boundary-related data show strong consistency but with some mis-sizing and occasional omissions.

### Hedge Diversity and Other Land-Use Codes

- Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species recorded 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%; mean species per plot CS2000 5.16 vs QA 5.89.
- This indicates robust but not perfect replication of hedge-associated biodiversity data.

### Arable Plots

- Only five arable plots analyzed; concordance was very poor, likely due to seasonal variation, inexperience with ruderal species, and identification challenges in arable margins.
- Recommendation: two visits per plot or more robust sampling for arable margin plots in future work.

## Overall Implications for Data Quality and Use

- Strengths:
  - High concordance in boundary mapping and most land-cover categories.
  - Directional-change analysis shows no systematic bias between CS2000 and QA.
  - Boundary and primary coding demonstrate robust data quality suitable for most analyses.
- Weaknesses and cautions:
  - Change reporting is under-recorded; substantial proportion of real changes may be missed.
  - Plot relocation and orientation can contribute to non-concordances; some plots not exactly relocated or mislocated, particularly for linear vs. non-linear plots.
  - Species identifications show persistent mis-match issues in grasses and certain forbs; overlooked species contribute to discrepancies.
  - Arable margins and certain habitat types (notably hedge/wall details, some hedges) show weaker agreement and may require targeted QA in future surveys.
  - Variation in herb and grass cover estimates across surveys suggests some seasonality effects and observer differences.
- Data product implications:
  - CS2000 mapping outputs (primary land cover, BAPs, boundaries) are generally reliable for broad-scale analyses; use caution with BAP classifications and change reporting.
  - Species lists and cover data can be used with an understanding of typical error sources (location, mis-identification, overlooked species, and cover disagreements).
  - For change analysis, consider integrating QA-adjusted change indicators or focusing on stable, well-mapped features; be mindful that 51.4% change concordance indicates substantial uncertainties.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

- The QA exercise demonstrates substantial overall reliability of CS2000 data, particularly in land-cover mapping and boundary coding, with notable strengths in consistency with earlier CS surveys.
- Key areas for improvement include:
  - Enhancing consistency in change reporting between surveyors and assessors.
  - Improving plot relocation protocols and documentation to reduce location/orientation mis-match.
  - Targeted training and calibration for grass and forbs identification and cover assessment, and better handling of seasonality effects.
  - Systematic verification for arable margin plots and hedge/wall coding with enhanced field checks.
- For data users, the CS2000 outputs are broadly trustworthy but should be interpreted with attention to the identified uncertainties, especially regarding changes over time and certain plant groups.
