# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Aims of QA: quantify the accuracy and consistency of field recording in CS2000; assess plot relocation efficiency; evaluate species concordance and cover estimates; examine changes in land cover and boundary recording; relate findings to prior CS1990 QA; and assess mapping and change-recording reliability.

- Scope and design:
  - Sample of 38 of 519 squares from 1998; one quarter of each square resurveyed.
  - 234 vegetation plots across nine plot types analyzed; includes quadrats, linear plots, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, and new arable field margin plots.
  - Comparison between CS2000 field data and QA reassessment to identify errors, biases, and changes.

- Core QA questions addressed:
  - How efficiently plots and plates could be relocated eight years later.
  - How accurately species were recorded and how often records agreed between original surveyors and QA assessors.
  - How well percentage cover for principal species was reproduced.
  - Whether recording biases or directional changes existed in habitat change signals.
  - How CS2000 mapping and land-use coding compared with QA coding.
  - How reliably changes in land use and habitat were recorded.

- Key findings

  - Plot relocation
    - Of 210 plots with full checks, 86.7% could be satisfactorily relocated.
    - CS2000 surveyors: ~60% relocated exactly; ~25% relocated with approximate accuracy; ~15% not adequately relocated.
    - Smaller 4 m2 habitat plots (Y-plots) hardest to relocate (23% failure).
    - Eight-year relocation feasibility demonstrated; some relocations still mis-sited (e.g., wrong bank/side of boundary).

  - Species concordance and recording accuracy
    - Approximately 6000 records analyzed; about 71% of species present were confirmed by QA observation at resurvey.
    - About 2% non-concordances due to real management or seasonal changes between surveys.
    - Overall initial recording accuracy around 73%, with most loss attributed to plot location errors.
    - When accounting for plot relocation issues, CS2000 vs QA efficiency for species recording in 1998 matched the prior 1990 comparison patterns.

  - Vegetation cover
    - For the 30 most frequent, appreciable-cover species, six were recorded at significantly different levels between CS2000 and QA (one likely seasonal).
    - Overall, cover agreement between CS2000 and QA was about 74% across major species; some species showed significant cover discrepancies (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum).

  - Direction of vegetation change (bias)
    - DECORANA ordination axis shift between original survey and QA was not significant overall; no consistent directional bias detected across plot types or land classes.

  - Land-cover mapping and boundary coding
    - Land-cover code groups assessed with three classification layers: primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes.
    - Concordance by group (CS2000 vs QA):
      - Primary land-cover codes: about 88% agreement.
      - BAP (broad habitat) codes: about 77% agreement.
      - Primary boundary codes: about 85% agreement.
      - Principal qualifying land-cover codes: about 73% agreement.
      - Boundary principal qualifying codes: about 83% agreement.
      - Species-awarded cover codes: about 63% agreement.
      - Species cover codes: about 74% agreement.
    - Overall land-cover mapping concordance with QA was high for primary codes, with more variability in the finer land-use and boundary detail.

  - Recording of change (land-use and habitat changes)
    - From 177 change instances analyzed, 16.4% attributed to surveyors’ errors/omissions in the 1990s baseline; overall concordance on change was only about 51.4%.
    - About 33.9% of real changes observed by QA were not noted by CS2000; around 14.7% were noted by CS2000 but not substantiated by QA.
    - A substantial portion of changes that occurred since 1990 may have been missed; emphasis on potential reliance on plot data for detecting change.

  - Hedge diversity plots
    - 19 hedge-diversity samples analyzed; total species recorded 124; common species 92.
    - Overall agreement between CS2000 and QA about 74.2% with surveyor efficiency around 77.4%.
    - Hedge plots tended to include a number of overlooked woody species, contributing to higher QA totals.

  - Arable plots
    - Only five arable margin plots analyzed; very tentative conclusions.
    - Concordance across these plots about 30.6%, with strong seasonal effects and a tendency for less scrupulous recording on ruderal species.
    - Recommendation: for arable margins, plan at least two well-spaced visits.

  - Change-analysis plotting (axis scores)
    - When aggregating quadrats by plot type and land class, no directional bias detected; mean axis scores CS2000 vs QA not significantly different.
    - Variation across land classes existed (arable-dominated vs grassland vs upland), but no systematic bias between CS2000 and QA placements.

- Overall interpretation and implications
  - CS2000 QA indicates robust overall data reliability for primary land-cover mapping and major habitat classifications, with strong relocation feasibility and reasonable species-record concordance.
  - Key weaknesses to address in future work:
    - Location/orientation errors contributing to species mis-matches and cover discrepancies.
    - Under-recording or mis-classification of certain grasses and some common species; mosses particularly challenging.
    - Change detection accuracy remains moderate; improvements needed in identifying and recording real habitat changes.
  - The QA framework provides a detailed, quantifiable basis for improving CS2000 data collection, coding schemes, and change analysis, with clear comparisons to the CS1990 QA benchmarks.

- Annexes and supplementary notes (highlights)
  - Annex B: field-operator efficiency and square-by-square comparisons; shows variation in efficiency across land classes and plots.
  - Tables summarize concordance by code group, change concordance, and cover codes; provide context for where CS2000 aligns with QA and where mis-matches occur.
  - Mapping and boundary coding tests emphasize the value of consistent coding schemes and the need for careful verification of boundary changes.
