# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
  - Built around the ITE Land Classification as a framework for stratified ecological sampling across Great Britain.
  - Aims to preserve time-series value by linking current methods to historical approaches.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure samples are representative of GB land types and to reduce bias.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to create land classes that define sampling strata.
  - Use of center squares (1 km) and surrounding squares to classify and validate strata.
  - Evolution from ecological features to land use and habitat mapping over time; integration with Land Cover Maps.

- Development timeline and key changes
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to derive 32 land classes from 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid).
    - 8 squares surveyed per class (256 total).
    - National habitat area estimates calculated as mean habitat area per square in a class times the land area of that class.
  - 1984 (Second GB land use survey)
    - Sampling framework retained; sample size increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (384 total).
    - Estimates still based on 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Land Classification revised to include data from all GB 1 km squares; urban/sea corrections added.
    - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats plus new data.
    - Publication of CS1990 main report; Land Classification updated for regional applicability.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification for CS1990; CS1998)
    - Land Classification extended to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
    - Field survey: 569 squares; national estimates aligned with revised framework.
  - 2000 (CS2000; separate country estimates)
    - Response to policy needs for country-specific reporting (England & Wales; Scotland).
    - Class sub-divisions created for country units; aggregation used where needed; total of 40 strata expanded to 40.
    - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland habitat sampling module introduced.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Wales-focused reporting adjustments)
    - Wales reporting required separate Wales-only results; Wales sampling increased to address under-representation.
    - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions (creating five new Welsh/England-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Strata increased to 45; Welsh squares added to ensure minimum representation; some English classes retained with reduced per-class counts.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares; England adjustments balanced to maintain precision.

- Sampling framework details and outputs
  - Class-based stratification
    - Land Classes defined by environmental attributes; 32 initially, expanding to 40 and then 45 strata through sub-divisions and country-specific splits.
  - Sample distribution and counts
    - CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007 tabulations show evolving numbers of squares per class and per country; detailed per-class and per-country counts provided in tables.
    - Table-like summaries show total GB squares, country splits (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales), and sampling rates (1:x) by class and survey year.
  - National estimates and consistency
    - Note that changing the underlying Land Classification affects national estimates; for consistency, calculations can use either the latest country-specific classification or the original 1990 framework.
    - Preference for using the latest classification for country estimates to reflect current stratification, while maintaining comparability with earlier surveys as needed.

- Upland and policy-relevant modules
  - Upland module (CS2000): added 30 squares in upland/marginal upland classes to improve accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
  - Wales-specific reporting (CS2007): dedicated Welsh-class subdivisions and increased Welsh sample to support Wales-only environmental policy and legislation reporting.

- Data products and outputs
  - Updated Land Classification maps for each reporting framework (e.g., England with Wales, Scotland; Wales-specific maps in 2007).
  - Tables and figures detailing the distribution of sample squares, strata, and sampling rates across surveys.
  - Documentation of methodological changes to support transparency, replication, and cross-survey comparisons.

- Challenges and considerations for data use
  - Representativeness: ensuring adequate representation of all land classes, particularly after reclassifications and country-specific splits.
  - Under-representation: addressing Wales’ relatively smaller sample size in earlier years; justification and impact analyses in 2006 scoping study.
  - Comparability: managing changes in land classification across survey years to maintain temporal comparability of national estimates.
  - Data lineage: clear traceability from original 1978 classifications through subsequent revisions to 2007 framework.
