# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Overview
  - National field handbook for CS2000 field surveys across GB, designed to produce GIS-ready, map-based data products.
  - Emphasises standardized methods, data quality, and integration with remote sensing to support time-series analysis, policy reporting, biodiversity Monitoring, and sustainability indicators.
  - Data collection combines field observations with GIS-ready formats (maps, plots, FABs, codes) to enable robust spatial analyses.

- Data capture and GIS-ready products
  - Extensive coding system for flora, mosses/lichens, and vegetation types, enabling precise, map-ready attribute data.
  - Hierarchical and coded Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) entries with primary/secondary codes, boundary change notes, and universal map codes (e.g., 888 new to map, 999 no longer on map, 701/702 change reliability).
  - Strong emphasis on reproducibility and time-series consistency through standardized field procedures and documentation.

- Field sampling framework (Section 10)
  - Three sampling types:
    - Soil sampling: five replicate soil cores per CS2000 square (within X-plots) for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna, and microbiology; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing.
    - Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen in Calluna vulgaris to assess regional nitrogen deposition effects; samples collected from current-year growth within 1 km squares.
    - Freshwater biota sampling: conducted by IFE staff; coordinated with CS2000 survey teams to avoid timing conflicts.
  - Sampling logistics and objectives designed to support baseline, regionally representative, spatially explicit data for later GIS analyses.

- Sampling procedures and logistics
  - Soil sampling procedure:
    - Five centre-plot locations per square (X-plots): three cores per location using specified pipe types, with precise distances (e.g., 15 cm north of centre corner) and depth.
    - Immediate packaging, labeling, and post-priority handling for rapid delivery of certain samples.
    - Centralized packing and distribution to regional coordinators for transport to ITE Merlewood.
  - Calluna sampling:
    - Within each 1 km square, collect CYG Calluna shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants, bag, seal, and despatch per guidelines.
  - Despatch and timing:
    - Options to despatch samples via research stations or direct posting; receipts for postage must be documented for T&S claims.

- Freshwater sampling
  - Coordinated scheduling with IFE staff; CS2000 teams may share sites with freshwater sampling efforts; timing arranged to minimize conflicts.

- Photography (Section 11)
  - One camera per team; use film stock and photographs of every vegetation plot to document appearance and landmark references.
  - Reference features should be obvious, unique, permanent, and visible in all conditions.
  - Each photo must include square and plot numbers (on a board placed at the plot edge) and be framed so the plot fills a substantial portion of the frame.

- Procedures after survey (Section 12)
  - Post-field checks to ensure no features were omitted; data may be transcribed to fresh maps only if necessary.
  - FABs and samples to be transported back to ITE Stations promptly.

- Annex 1 - GPS data collection
  - Detailed GPS data collection workflow for relocation and ground-truthing of plots, including:
    - Pre-checks (battery, satellites, PDOP) and recording stationary vs. moving features.
    - Customized file naming: square number plus plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE) or feature-specific IDs (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
    - Data logging procedures, sampling rate settings, and field naming conventions to ensure GIS-friendly geospatial data.
    - Tips for improving positional accuracy (PDOP < 6 in 3D; ensuring clear sky views).
  - Guidance on handling equipment, power, almanacs, obstructions, and equipment keypads.

- Equipment, distribution, and field data workflow
  - Standardized equipment list (e.g., cool box, trowel, long blade knife) distributed to teams; specialized packing for samples and envelopes to ITE Merlewood.
  - Use of a structured FAB and an Attribute Reference Sheet to expedite data entry and ensure consistency across squares and plots.
  - Emphasis on standardized data capture to support robust GIS analyses and time-series consistency.

- Plant and biodiversity coding (Annex)
  - Comprehensive coded lists for ferns, forbs/woody species, and mosses/lichens, enabling consistent species- and habitat-level mapping in GIS.
  - Codes support hierarchical classification, cross-referencing common plant groups with specific taxa or broader categories, facilitating scalable map-based vegetation representations.
