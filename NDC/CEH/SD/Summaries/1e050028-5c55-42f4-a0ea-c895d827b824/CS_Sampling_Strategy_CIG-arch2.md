# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify a national ecological survey of Great Britain.
  - Aims to provide time-series, comparable data on environmental features and habitats for monitoring environmental health and policy performance.

- Core concepts
  - ITE Land Classification
    - An environmental stratification system developed to partition GB into discrete land classes based on climate, geology, altitude, physiography, and related factors.
    - Began in the 1970s with 32 classes; expanded over time to 40–45 classes to support national and country-specific reporting.
  - Stratified random sampling
    - To avoid bias, sampling is performed within strata (land classes) using objective random methods.
    - Early approach used center squares of a 15x15 km grid (1 km squares as sampling units) with surrounding squares allocated to classes for a total of several thousand classified squares.
  - Sampling units and replication
    - 1 km squares used as primary sample units; initial field surveys targeted a manageable number per class (eight per class in CS1978).
    - Subsequent surveys increased sample density within classes to improve precision and enable country- and region-specific estimates.

- Evolution by survey period
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
    - 1 km squares classified within a 15x15 km grid; eight samples per Land Class; total of 256 squares surveyed.
    - Habitat areas estimated per class by combining mean habitat area per square with class area.
  - 1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - Increased sampling to 12 squares per Land Class (total 384); continued use of 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
    - Classification updated to include all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Repeated measurements from 1978 vegetation quadrats; adoption of land-cover data (e.g., first GB Land Cover Map).
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; CS2000)
    - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to support Scotland reporting; approach extended to classify every GB square using surrogates for climate, geology, and physiography.
    - Introduction of country-unit estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) and adjustments to ensure adequate representation across classes.
    - Additional sampling to improve estimates for uplands and country-specific reporting.
  - 2000 (CS2000 Summary and Adjustments)
    - Framework modified to enable England with Wales and Scotland-only estimates using country-specific squares.
    - Creation of 40 strata through class subdivision/aggregation; 19 additional squares to ensure representation; some class reductions in England compensated by English sampling balance.
  - 2007 (CS2007 Welsh-focused Adjustments)
    - Wales-only reporting drive led to Welsh-specific class subdivisions and additional Welsh squares (minimum of 6 per Welsh class).
    - England adjustments implemented to maintain overall balance (some classes in England retained at four squares per class due to Welsh expansions).
    - Final framework comprises 45 strata across the three countries (England, Wales, Scotland) with Wales receiving enhanced representation for country-specific outputs.

- Uplands module
  - CS2000 introduced an uplands survey module (30 extra squares) in England and Wales to improve habitat estimates in upland/marginal areas and support country-based statistics.

- National estimates and reporting
  - National estimates are derived by combining class-level habitat information with class area, using the latest available Land Classification.
  - Changes in the Land Classification affect cross-survey comparability; two approaches discussed:
    - Use the latest classification for GB-wide estimates (preferred for consistency with a given survey).
    - Use the original 1990 classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - For Wales, Scotland, and England with Wales reporting, the sampling framework evolved to deliver country-specific estimates with appropriate representations of new and subdivided classes.

- Outputs and documentation
  - Results underpin Countryside Survey main reports and country-specific reports (e.g., Countryside Survey 1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - Outputs include habitat area estimates, land-class maps, and accompanying statistical guidance for interpreting time-series data.

- Notable considerations for analysts
  - Data continuity and comparability across surveys depend on classification consistency and documented methodological adjustments.
  - The framework accommodates time-series monitoring while adapting to policy needs for country-specific reporting (Scotland, England, Wales) and upland habitat accuracy.
  - The strategy emphasizes scalable, structured data production (classification-based stratification, standardized sampling, and transparent estimation procedures) to support environmental health assessments and policy scrutiny over time.
