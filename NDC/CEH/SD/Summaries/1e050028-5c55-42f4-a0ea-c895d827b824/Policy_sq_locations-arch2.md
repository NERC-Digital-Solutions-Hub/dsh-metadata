# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys to maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land.
- Public-interest rationale; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations may be released

- General release allows identification of whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- For approximate location needs, four-digit grid references (identifying 10x10 km grid square) may be released under licence.
- For precise six-digit grid references, CEH should carry out pre-processing to avoid release, with exceptional external release only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances (license, demonstrate IP confidentiality equivalent or higher).
- Spatial data inside survey squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-terms release as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release

- Licensees must keep data confidential, stored securely, with access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
- After licensing period, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No third-party release that could compromise location confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of JCOP-equivalent project-management standards.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP-confidentiality threshold of six-digit releases; still barred from attempting to identify precise locations.

## Responsibilities and process

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
- Licence approvals/denials follow statutory procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS-partner use, CEH aims to support pre-processing within a reasonable timeframe; other organisations’ requests are case-by-case.
- Partners are recommended to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be beneficial and is negotiated case-by-case (collaboration or payment).
