# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public-interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations. Applies specifically to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: Natural Environment Research Council (via CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Why locations are confidential:
  - Protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Preserve scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
  - Public-interest justification; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 through CEH.

- When locations may be released (and precision levels):
  - Approximate locations: four-digit grid references (identifies 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence.
  - Precise locations: six-digit grid references are available only in very exceptional circumstances, with CEH processing required to avoid direct release; must demonstrate that associated IP/data has equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalents to location data and follow the same exceptional-access terms as six-digit releases.

- Licence terms and restrictions:
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and access limited to named individuals with legitimate needs.
  - Licences are time-bound for specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the license period, with written confirmation.
  - No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If required, licensees must provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar but lesser IP-confidentiality criteria compared to six-digit releases, with a clause preventing attempts to identify precise square locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences.
  - Licences must be signed by senior representatives of the licensee organisation.
  - If a release request is denied, CEH supports the decision under relevant acts/regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - For internal CS partner use, CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Recommendation to consult CEH before committing to using CS location data; CEH may assist in defining requirements or supporting appropriate use, either collaboratively or for a fee.
