# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Sets the confidentiality policy for Countryside Survey (CS) square locations and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and internal spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## CS partners (current)
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Maintains scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveying.
- Confidentiality supports continued ability to inform environmental policy.

## When locations may be released (and precision)
- Allow approximate location: identify which survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone). Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references only under exceptional licence, after CEH pre-processing analysis is considered to avoid release. Extremely rare cases require demonstrating equivalent or higher confidentiality protections for IP/data.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality and are released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.

## License and use conditions
- Licensees must: keep data confidential, store securely, restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need, and use data only for the project specified.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at project end.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan or visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; both prohibit attempts to identify precise square locations from the data.

## Roles and governance
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Licences must be signed by authorized senior personnel from the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under relevant Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licensing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing for CS partners within reasonable timeframes; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using any data covered by this policy to help define requirements and ensure appropriate use; collaboration or paid support is negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for GIS specialists
- Use four-digit grid references when you can: identify whether squares fall within your area of interest without revealing exact locations.
- Seek CEH pre-processing support for analyses requiring precise locations to avoid unnecessary release of sensitive data.
- Plan data handling to meet licensing periods and secure storage requirements; ensure destruction and verification at project end.
- If precise data are needed, prepare a strong legal/IC confidentiality justification demonstrating comparable protection for your data.
- Coordinate with CEH early in project planning to align on data requirements, licensing, and potential support.
