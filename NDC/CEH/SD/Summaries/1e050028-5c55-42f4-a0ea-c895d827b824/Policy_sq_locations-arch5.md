# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Purpose: maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- The Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permissions.
- Public interest basis; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access and release: when data can be released
- Allowed: approximate locations identified within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone). Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence.
- Precise needs: six-digit grid references require CEH pre-processing to avoid release; VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases may grant external location information under licence if IP/data confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (habitat maps, linear features) carry equivalent confidentiality and will be released only under the same exceptional terms.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration and for specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
- No third-party release that could compromise location confidentiality; cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP) if requested.
- Four-digit releases have fewer IP confidentiality constraints than six-digit releases.
- License clauses prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations or to claim such derivation.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes all decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with agreed terms; signatories must have authority within the licensee organisation.
- If a release is denied, CEH follows Act and Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS partnership use, CEH aims to support pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case handling for other organisations.
- Data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to CS location data; CEH may provide scientific lead support, either collaboratively or for a fee, negotiated case-by-case.
