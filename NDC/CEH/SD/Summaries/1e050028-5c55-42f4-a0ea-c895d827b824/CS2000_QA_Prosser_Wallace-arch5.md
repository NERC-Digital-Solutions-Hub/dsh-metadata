# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Overview
  - Purpose: Assess consistency and reliability of the CS2000 field programme across plot relocation, species records, vegetation cover, landcover mapping, and changes since 1990.
  - Sampling: 38 of 519 squares were selected; in each, one quarter resurveyed, covering 234 species plots across nine plot types.
  - Objectives: quantify field recording accuracy, plot relocation efficiency, observer bias, and changes over time; relate findings to the CS1990 QA for comparability.

- Methods and Scope
  - Plot types and locations: Seven main plot types (quadrats and linear plots) including road verges, streamsides, and boundaries; some new plots introduced for CS2000.
  - Relocation and marking: Buried metal plates used to mark plot corners; relocation tests included plate and plot recovery eight years after burial; QA assessment compared CS2000 relocation with QA locating capabilities.
  - Data comparison: CS2000 field records versus QA assessments across multiple dimensions (species, cover, landcover codes, boundaries, hedge features, and changes).

- Key Findings

  - Plot relocation
    - CS2000: 86.7% full relocation success; 60% accurately relocated, ~25% relocated, ~15% not relocated adequately.
    - Plate recovery: QA located 69.3% of plates; overall relative success similar to prior QA, indicating eight-year relocation feasibility.
    - Overall implication: 60% accurate relocation, ~40-45% plausible relocation when including partial success; some relocation errors occurred (e.g., wrong bank/side of features).

  - Species concordance
    - Mean species per plot: CS2000 = 17.9; QA = 20.4 (QA generally longer species lists).
    - Concordance: ~71% of records confirmed in QA; ~2% non-concordances due to management/seasonal changes.
    - Overall initial recording efficiency: ~73% (CS2000), with improvements when considering changes and plot relocation.
    - Change and mis-match types: mis-identifications, overlooked species, orientation/location errors contributed to non-concordance (categories TI and T2).

  - Vegetation cover
    - General finding: QA often produced longer species lists; cover values largely aligned across surveyors and assessors.
    - Significant differences (selected examples): Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum showed significant cover differences between CS2000 and QA; some differences may reflect seasonal effects.
    - Overall: mixed but substantial agreement for major species’ cover; some discrepancies for particular taxa.

  - Landcover mapping
    - Primary landcover codes: high concordance; 88% agreement.
    - BAP (broad habitat) codes: 77% agreement.
    - Primary boundary codes: 85% (and higher when considering overall code concordance).
    - Overall primary land cover agreement: 87.5% (excluding BAP codes: ~91.6% agreement; including BAP codes: ~87.5%).

  - Change in land use and boundary/hedge changes
    - Change recording: 177 instances analyzed; 16.4% deemed errors/omissions by assessors.
    - Change concurrence: 51.4% overall; 33.9% not noted by CS2000; 14.7% noted but not substantiated by assessors.
    - Implication: substantial portion of real changes since 1990 may have been missed; CS2000 data may be more reliable for evaluating change than the accompanying changes recorded.

  - Hedge diversity and boundary features
    - Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
    - Mean number of species per hedge plot: CS2000 = 5.16; QA = 5.89 (QA recorded more species).
    - Boundary features: high agreement for boundary height and stockproof status; primary boundary code concordance 92.8%; overall boundary-related concordance around 85–92% depending on measure.
    - Hedge shape coding (new codes 374–380) had limited success; many boundaries fell into code 374 (box-shaped hedge).

  - Arable plots
    - Only five plots analyzed; concordance was extremely poor, likely due to seasonality and lower familiarity with ruderal/arable species.
    - Recommendation: consider two visits to future arable margin plots to improve reliability.

- Overall Implications for Data Stewardship
  - Strengths: Strong performance in mapping land cover and boundary features; robust primary coding concordance; metaclassification of broad habitat types is reliable.
  - Limitations: Inconsistent capture of changes over time; substantial mis-match potential from plot location/orientation; variable accuracy in species identification and cover estimates for certain taxa; limited reliability in arable plots.
  - Data quality signals: The QA demonstrates that systematic, codified QA processes can quantify observer error, relocation reliability, and coding consistency; highlights the need for rigorous metadata on plot location, orientation, and timing, as well as transparent change-record workflows.

- Practical Recommendations for Data Governance
  - Ensure robust georeferencing: maintain stable, precise plot marking, and standardized relocation procedures with clear documentation of plate/mark status and orientation.
  - Strengthen metadata: capture observer IDs, equipment used (plates, sensors), date/time, weather/season, and field protocols to support traceability and reproducibility.
  - Improve change tracking: implement explicit change logging with criteria to distinguish real ecological changes from coding or relocation errors; consider ongoing QA cycles to monitor change detection performance.
  - Standardize coding taxonomy: maintain and publish a comprehensive codebook for land cover, boundary, hedge, and stockproof classifications; implement validation checks to minimize mis-identifications and mis-placements.
  - Prioritize high-impact areas: allocate QA resources to plots with historically higher mis-match risk (e.g., arable margins, hedgerows, road verges) and to plots requiring seasonal revisits.
  - Document data lineage and provenance: retain original CS2000 and QA datasets with clear linkage to reproducing analyses and for longitudinal comparisons.

- Takeaway for Data Stewardship
  - The Countryside Survey 2000 QA exercise demonstrates that comprehensive QA can quantify reliability across data capture, location accuracy, and coding. While mapping and general species inventories show strong agreement, detection of change and certain taxonomic/coding aspects require strengthened procedures, consistent metadata, and ongoing QA integration to ensure datasets remain readily discoverable, interoperable, and trustworthy for future reuse.
