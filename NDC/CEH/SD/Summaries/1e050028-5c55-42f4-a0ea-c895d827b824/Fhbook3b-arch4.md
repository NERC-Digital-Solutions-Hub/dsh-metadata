# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides standardized, high-quality field methods for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) to monitor land use, biodiversity, and landscape change across Great Britain.
  - Builds time-series data to support national/international environmental policy and reporting.
  - Emphasizes standardized procedures to reduce observer variation and improve statistical reliability.

- Data architecture and scope
  - Core data elements:
    - Mapping of land cover and landscape features
    - Plot-based vegetation sampling
    - Various plot types for different habitat types
  - Plot types (examples and purposes)
    - X PLOTS (Large/Wally): 200 m2 primary vegetation sampling
    - Y PLOTS (Small): 2 m x 2 m habitat baselines
    - U PLOTS (Unenclosed): 2 m x 2 m unenclosed landscapes
    - B PLOTS (Boundary): 200 m2 boundary vegetation plots
    - A PLOTS (Arable margin): 100 x 1 m plots near arable margins
    - H PLOTS (Hedgerows): 10 x 1 m plots along hedgerows
    - D PLOTS (Hedgerow diversity): 30 m hedgerow segments
    - S & W PLOTS (Streamside/Waterside): plots along watercourses
    - R & V PLOTS (Roadside/Verge): 10 x 1 m plots along roadsides
  - Data standards and coding
    - Extensive coding system for vegetation, land cover, boundaries, buildings, etc.
    - Preference for CS1990 codes; CS2000 introduces new codes with guidance to minimize ambiguity.
    - Metadata linkage through Field Assessment Books (FABs), parcel numbers, and mapping theme maps for traceability and retrospective analysis.
  - Species and taxa reference
    - Detailed, codified lists for flora (e.g., forbs/woody species, ferns; mosses/lichens) to support consistent identification and data recording.
  - Cross-year comparability
    - Backward compatibility with CS1990 where possible; procedures for describing radical changes with new parcel codes; documented methods for transferring, renumbering, or splitting features.

- Sampling framework and planning
  - 568 squares planned; 508 carried over from CS1990 plus replacements/additions.
  - Six teams, each surveying roughly 95 squares; ~4 days per square.
  - New and old squares sequenced consistently; upland representation integrated; alignment with new Land Classes.
  - Permissions and access required from landowners; engagement and background information collection encouraged.

- Data collection tools and field logistics
  - Core tools: Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), 1:10,000 maps, GPS, aerial photographs, compasses, and recording sheets.
  - Equipment safety, care, and timely replacement emphasized.
  - Plot relocation and establishment
    - Permanent markers (plates) near plots to aid relocation
    - Relocation guided by plans, photos, and metal plates; GPS and photography document positions
  - Data capture focus
    - Mapping, plot vegetation sampling, and sampling of various plot types
    - Nested sub-plots with predefined species lists and 5% cover categories
    - Bryophytes and lichens recorded from defined lists; comprehensive sketches and photos accompany data sheets

- Data recording, management, and quality
  - Coding system covers vegetation, land cover, boundaries, buildings, and other features
  - Strong emphasis on data quality controls
    - Standardized field handbook to minimize observer variation
    - Training and ongoing quality control across observers and years
  - Metadata and traceability
    - FABs, parcel numbers, and mapping theme maps linked via parcel codes

- Change detection and output
  - Section 8 outlines mapping of changes between old and new squares
  - Two broad habitat approaches
    - Mappable Broad Habitats (BAPs): detailed mapping for certain broad habitats
    - Plottable Broad Habitats (BAPs): broader habitat mapping with additional plots for change monitoring
  - Procedures to translate 1990 descriptions into CS2000/BAP frameworks
  - Integration of ponds data and ancillary historic maps where applicable

- Geographic scope and annexes
  - Coordinated across England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man; country outputs reported as required
  - Annex on GPS data collection procedures for plot relocation and ground-truthing

- Section 10 – Sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater)
  - Soil sampling
    - Five replicate soil samples per 1 km square within CS2000 squares
    - Sampling in each X-plot centre: three cores (two long/short pipes) to capture soil properties, fauna, microbiology
    - Immediate post-sampling handling and mailing procedures to ITE Merlewood
  - Calluna vulgaris sampling
    - Foliar nitrogen sampling to assess nitrogen deposition impacts
    - Collection of current-year growth (CYG) shoots; random sampling across Calluna plants within squares
    - Proper bagging, labeling, and prompt despatch for analysis
  - Freshwater sampling
    - Conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff; coordination with CS2000 field teams

- Section 11 – Photography
  - One camera per team; photography of every vegetation plot
  - Reference features that are obvious, permanent, unique, and visible in future visits
  - Photos must include square/plot identifiers on a marked board; composition to emphasize plot area and reference features

- Section 12 – Procedures after survey
  - Post-survey data checks to ensure no features are omitted
  - Preferable to avoid re-transcribing data; if necessary, only in case of damage or loss
  - Arrangements to transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations

- Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data
  - Step-by-step guidance for GPS setup, stationary vs moving positions, file naming conventions (e.g., 501X4.PSE)
  - Logging procedures, battery management, almanac updates, and PDOP guidance
  - Handling obstructions and device operation tips; notation for rapid data entry and feature identification

- Practical implications for Data Leaders
  - CS2000 provides a rigorous, standardized framework for large-scale, longitudinal data on land cover and biodiversity
  - Supports governance, consistency, and cross-institution collaboration through standard codes, forms, and QA processes
  - Enables integration with remote-sensing data and ground-truthing to enhance change detection and habitat mapping
  - Produces policy-relevant outputs (biodiversity action plans, sustainable development indicators) via comparable, well-documented data across years and regions
  - Addresses data access and coordination challenges through explicit permissions, data recording standards, and QA procedures designed to minimize gaps and inconsistencies
