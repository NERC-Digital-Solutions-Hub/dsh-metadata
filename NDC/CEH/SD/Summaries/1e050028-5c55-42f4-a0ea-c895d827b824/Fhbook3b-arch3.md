# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview of the CS2000 sampling program
- Three main sampling types are conducted within CS2000: soil sampling, Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling, and freshwater biota sampling.
- Soil and Calluna sampling are undertaken by CS2000 field surveyors; freshwater sampling is performed by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff.
- The sampling aims to establish baseline, spatially referenced data to support soil quality indices, vegetation monitoring, and biodiversity indicators across 1 km square blocks used in the national survey framework.

## Section 10: Sampling
- Background and purpose
  - Soil sampling supports soil quality assessment and development of indices for soil biological activity and diversity, providing baseline data for national comparisons.
  - Five replicate samples are taken per 1 km square: three soil chemistry/diversity/microbiology samples and two others for specific analyses.
- Soil sampling procedure
  - In each square: five sampling locations around the centre plot (X-plot).
  - Three soil cores collected with a long black pipe (approx. 15 cm depth) and two with short white pipes (8 cm length) at defined offsets (e.g., 15 cm north, east, and west of the centre).
  - Use aluminum plate and lump hammer to drive pipes into soil; extract soil carefully to avoid loss; place soils in labelled bags; ship short-pipe samples promptly to ITE Merlewood; long-pipe samples stored for regional collection.
  - Detailed step-by-step collection protocol emphasizes consistent location, depth, labeling, and timely despatch.
- Calluna sampling
  - Collect current year’s growth (CYG) from Calluna vulgaris plants within squares.
  - Randomly sample 30–50 g fresh weight of CYG shoots; label and seal; despatch to ITE Merlewood or via research stations, with attention to sample freshness and drying if needed.
  - The Calluna data support analyses of foliar nitrogen with deposition data to identify regions exceeding critical nitrogen loads.
- Freshwater sampling
  - Coordinated with IFE staff; sampling occurs in parallel with field survey work, with scheduling arranged to avoid conflicts.

## Section 11: Photography
- Each survey team receives a camera; film stock is provided and replenished as needed.
- Photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and geolocation relative to landmarks.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and unique; include square and plot numbers on a visible board at each plot edge.
- Photos should capture about half the frame with the plot and reference features, avoiding excessive sky and ensuring legibility of identifiers.

## Section 12: Procedures after survey
- Data verification
  - At day’s end, review data sheets to ensure no features are omitted.
  - Data should not be transposed onto new maps unless damage or spoilage necessitates it.
- Transport and processing
  - FABs (Field Assessment Books) and samples should be transported to ITE stations as soon as possible after surveys.

## Annex 1: Collecting GPS data
- Preparations and live operation
  - Ensure GPS has sufficient battery, satellite visibility (minimum four), and acceptable PDOP (preferably below 6 for 3D fixes).
  - Record stationary positions for plots and moving features for boundaries (upland areas).
- File naming and data management
  - Each plot or feature requires its own data file; filenames must identify square and plot/feature (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4).
  - There are predefined attribute options for new features (e.g., plot types, boundaries, agriculture points) to standardize data entry.
- Logging and data entry
  - Set data sampling rate (default 1 second); start and stop logging as you collect data along features or at plots.
  - Use the attribute reference list to quickly select plot identifiers; confirm selections to append an asterisk marker for active entries.
- Practical notes
  - For stationary plot positions, maintain a clear line of sight to satellites for 3–5 minutes if possible.
  - If obstructed, elevate the GPS antenna to improve reception; manage PDOP and accuracy considerations.
  - Battery charging, almanac updates, and GPS operations are documented to ensure repeatable and traceable positioning data.
- Data entry interfaces
  - The Annex provides detailed guidance on using the device keypad, including specific commands and shortcuts for rapid entry of plot IDs and features.
  - An attribute reference sheet maps code numbers to plot IDs (e.g., X-series, D-series, S-series, W-series, etc.), enabling efficient data capture.

## Vegetation data coding and annex notes (context for field data capture)
- The handbook includes extensive coded lists for flora (e.g., ferns, forbs, woody species) used to standardize species recording within plots.
- A consistent coding scheme supports long-term, comparable vegetation data across survey iterations and policy-relevant indicators.

## Data management and governance (implied)
- Emphasis on standardized methods, traceability, and repeatability to support national monitoring and policy indicators.
- Procedures aim to minimize observer variation and ensure data integrity across time-series monitoring.
