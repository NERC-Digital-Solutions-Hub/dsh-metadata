# Water quality survey of streams across Wales: runoff form forested and felled catchments draining a range of soil types

## Overview
- A survey of water quality in small streams draining forested and felled catchments across Wales.
- Part of a joint NERC, Environment Agency, and Forestry Commission funded study to examine impacts of conifer harvesting and replanting on upland water quality (Neal et al., 1998).
- Sampling spanned 7 September 1995 to 18 November 1997; sites were 2–5 ha with single tree/soil type at each location.
- Opportunistic sampling conducted with Forest Enterprise staff, capturing baseflow and stormflow conditions (dry vs. very wet weather).

## Data Coverage and Scope
- Survey includes runoff water quality data from forested and felled catchments across Wales.
- Focus on a wide range of water quality measures, including major, minor, trace, and ultra-trace elements, plus nutrients, pH, and Gran alkalinity.
- Sampling frequency per site ranged from 1 to 10 measurements depending on feasibility.

## Data Content and Structure
- The dataset is provided as raw data (not edited to remove values below detection or censored values).
- Metadata includes:
  - Analytical methods used, including detection levels and related details so users can standardize to edited datasets.
  - Site location information with grid references.
  - Associated site information: soil types, tree species, felling dates, and field sampling protocols prior to chemical analysis.
- Acknowledges the need to adjust raw data to standard protocols for edited analyses if required.

## Metadata and Documentation
- Metadata files accompany the dataset to describe:
  - Site locations and grid references.
  - Soil types, tree species, and felling dates.
  - Field sampling protocols and pre-chemical analysis procedures.
  - Analytical methods and detection limits.

## Access, Use, and Citation
- The work and dataset are associated with Neal et al. (1998): The impacts of conifer harvesting on runoff water quality: a regional survey for Wales.
- Open access: the cited paper is available through the Hydrology and Earth System Sciences website.
- Users are asked to cite Neal et al. (1998) when using or publishing material from this dataset.

## Governance, Provenance, and Stewardship Considerations
- Data are raw and intended for researchers who require detailed, less-processed information to perform analyses.
- Metadata supports reproducibility and re-use, enabling alignment with standard presentation protocols if an edited dataset is produced.
- No explicit data sharing restrictions or embargo details are provided beyond the open-access citation note; provenance links to the original funding and collaboration (NERC, EA, Forestry Commission).

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- Ensure availability of both raw data and comprehensive metadata to support reprocessing into standardized datasets.
- Maintain clear provenance by linking to Neal et al. (1998) and the funding/publishing context.
- Provide or preserve access to accompanying metadata (methods, detection limits, site and soil information) to enable proper data cleaning and harmonization for future reuse.
- Facilitate citation and attribution within any derived analyses or publications.
