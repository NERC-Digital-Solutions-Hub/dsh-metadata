# Monitoring and sampling protocols

## Purpose and scope
- Sampling across Wales to assess baseflow chemistry and stormflow, using sites that represent single soil/tree types, management schemes, and definable catchment boundaries.
- Focus on small catchments (2–5 ha) with first-order streams, and sites that are either completely forested or completely harvested.
- Documentation of site details (soil/tree types, planting/harvesting times, replanting in some cases) and confirmation of Forest Enterprise staff availability for sample collection.
- Sampling triggered by CEH weather alerts to capture extended dry periods (baseflow) and regional storm conditions (stormflow).

## Site selection criteria
- Each catchment represents a single soil and tree type and management scheme.
- Definable boundary with a first-order stream draining it.
- Small catchment area (2–5 ha).
- Fully forested or fully harvested.
- Availability of site details (soil/tree types, planting/harvesting times, replanting in limited cases).
- Availability of Forest Enterprise staff to collect samples.

## Sampling procedure
- Sampling teams receive a variety of cleaned plastic and glass bottles suitable for major, minor, and trace element analyses.
- Sampling triggered by weather-related CEH alerts, including extended dry periods and storm events to sample baseflow and stormflow.

## Sample handling and transport
- Samples taken to the local Forest Enterprise office and dispatched, typically the same day, to CEH Staylittle, mid-Wales, for processing.
- The next working day at CEH Staylittle involves pH measurement and Gran titration assays.
- Remaining samples are filtered (0.45 µm); filtrates stored in appropriate bottles for shipment to CEH Wallingford for further chemical analysis.
- For metal analyses, samples are acidified to prevent storage artefacts.

## Analytical methods and storage
- pH samples stored in glass bottles with immediate analysis on opening to avoid CO2 degassing and pH rise.
- At Forest Enterprise and CEH offices, samples stored in the dark at 4°C to minimize storage artefacts.
- Filtrates prepared for downstream chemical analysis after initial processing at Staylittle.

## Documentation, metadata, and governance implications
- Site details captured include soil and tree types, planting/harvesting times, and replanting information, enabling rich metadata for each sample.
- Clear chain-of-custody: local Forest Enterprise office → CEH Staylittle → CEH Wallingford.
- Standardised procedures for sample preservation, filtration, and immediate analyses to maintain data quality and comparability.
- Emphasis on timely processing to reduce artefacts and ensure data usability for downstream research and decision-making.
