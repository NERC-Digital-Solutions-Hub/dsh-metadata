# Water quality survey of streams across Wales: runoff form forested and felled catchments draining a range of soil types

- Overview
  - Joint study funded by NERC, Environment Agency, and Forestry Commission to examine the impacts of conifer harvesting and replanting on upland water quality in Wales.
  - Monitoring period: 7 September 1995 to 18 November 1997.
  - Focus on small catchments (2–5 ha) with varied soils, sampling forested and felled catchments.
  - Opportunistic sampling guided by Forest Enterprise staff, intended to capture baseflow and stormflow conditions.

- Data content
  - Extensive water quality measurements across major, minor, trace, and ultra-trace elements, plus nutrients and standard measures (pH, Gran alkalinity).
  - Data provided as raw, unedited values (no exclusion of < values), enabling detailed analysis and avoiding information loss.
  - Metadata includes analytical methods, detection levels, and other protocol details to enable reprocessing to standard datasets.

- Sampling design and timeline
  - Number of samplings per site ranged from 1 to 10, dictated by feasibility.
  - Sites varied in tree species, soil type, and felling dates; single tree/soil type per location.
  - Sampling periods chosen to represent baseflow (dry conditions) and stormflow (very wet conditions).

- Metadata and documentation
  - Separate metadata files describing site locations (grid references), soil types, tree species, felling dates, and field sampling/protocols prior to chemical analysis.
  - Analytical methods and detection limits documented within metadata to support data calibration and standardization.

- Data access and usage
  - Open access dataset; citation recommended: Neal et al. 1998, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences.
  - Findings and scope summarized in Neal et al. 1998: “The impacts of conifer harvesting on runoff water quality: a regional survey for Wales.”
  - Dataset is suitable for statistical analysis and can be reprocessed to edited formats using the provided methods and metadata.

- Practical considerations for data leadership
  - Raw data with rich metadata supports reprocessing to aligned standards; essential for cross-network data integration and governance.
  - Recognize potential data integration challenges due to scattered sources and variable sampling frequency; plan for standardization and documentation to enhance discoverability and reuse.
  - Clear citation path and open access facilitate sharing within wider data communities and support evidence-informed decision-making.
