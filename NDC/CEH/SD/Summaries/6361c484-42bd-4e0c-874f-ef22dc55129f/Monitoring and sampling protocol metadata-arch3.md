# Monitoring and sampling protocols

## Overview
- Sampling sites across Wales were selected to ensure representativeness of soil and tree types, management schemes, definable catchment boundaries, presence of a first-order stream, small catchment size (2–5 ha), and either fully forested or fully harvested conditions.
- Site details available (soil/tree types, planting/harvesting times) and availability of Forest Enterprise staff for sampling.
- Sampling triggered by CEH weather alerts: extended dry periods to assess baseflow chemistry and regional storm conditions to sample stormflow.

## Sampling design and fieldwork
- Sampling teams used a variety of cleaned plastic and glass bottles to collect samples for major, minor, and trace elements.
- Samples collected and dispatched the same day to CEH Staylittle for processing; pH and titration (Gran titration) assays performed the next working day at CEH Staylittle.
- Remaining samples filtered (0.45 µm) and filtrates stored in appropriate bottles for shipment to CEH Wallingford for further chemical analysis.

## Sample handling and analysis
- Metal analysis samples were acidified prior to analysis to eliminate storage artefacts.
- pH measurements were performed immediately on opening to avoid CO2 degassing that could raise pH.

## Storage and transport
- At Forest Enterprise and CEH offices, samples were stored in the dark at 4°C to minimize storage artefacts.
