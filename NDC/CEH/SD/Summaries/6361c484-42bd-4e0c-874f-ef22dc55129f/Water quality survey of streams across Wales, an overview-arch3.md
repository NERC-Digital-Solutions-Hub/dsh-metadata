# Water quality survey of streams across Wales: runoff form forested and felled catchments draining a range of soil types

- Overview
  - Joint study funded by NERC, Environment Agency, and Forestry Commission to examine the impacts of conifer harvesting and replanting on upland water quality in Wales.
  - Study area: small catchments (2–5 ha) with varying soil types.
  - Sampling period: 7 September 1995 to 18 November 1997.
  - Sampling design: opportunistic, with Forest Enterprise staff assisting; sites sampled under both baseflow (dry weather) and stormflow (very wet weather) conditions.

- Data content
  - Extensive water quality measurements, including major, minor, trace, and ultra-trace elements, plus nutrients, pH, and Gran alkalinity.
  - Data provided as raw measurements (not edited to exclude values below detection limits) to enable detailed statistical analysis.

- Sampling design and period
  - Sites chosen to represent single tree and soil type at each location.
  - Number of samplings per site ranged from 1 to 10, depending on sampling feasibility.
  - Focus on groundwater and soil endmember chemistries under different hydrological conditions.

- Metadata and methods
  - Metadata files describe site locations (grid references), soil types, tree species, and felled dates, plus field sampling and pre-analysis protocols.
  - Analytical methods and detection levels are included within the metadata to allow recalibration to standard protocols if needed.

- Data status and usage
  - Data are raw, intended for the research community to observe detailed patterns and perform analyses without pre-editing.
  - Metadata enables adjustment and standardization before presentation.
  - Encourages proper citation: Neal et al., 1998.

- Relevance to monitoring frameworks
  - Exemplifies end-to-end monitoring data lifecycle: study design, field sampling under varying conditions, comprehensive metadata, raw data provision, and clear publication of findings.
  - Provides a model for metadata completeness (locations, soil/tree/felling info, protocols) and explicit analytical methods, aiding data governance and reproducibility.
  - Demonstrates openness and accessibility of data to researchers, while highlighting potential barriers for policy-oriented monitoring (raw data require processing; need for standardization to support rapid decision-making).

- Considerations for data governance
  - While raw data enable detailed analyses, they require additional processing for policy use; plan for data standardization and quality assurance.
  - Metadata richness is essential for data reuse and verification; ensure metadata remain up-to-date with any reprocessing.
  - Open access citations support transparency and accountability in policy evaluations.
