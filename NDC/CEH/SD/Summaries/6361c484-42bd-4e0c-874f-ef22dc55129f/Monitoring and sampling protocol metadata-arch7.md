# Monitoring and sampling protocols

- Objective and scope
  - Document the selection of sampling sites across Wales to capture representative catchments with consistent soil/tree types and management schemes, definable boundaries, and first-order drainage.
  - Ensure sites are small (2–5 ha), either fully forested or fully harvested, and have available site details (soil/tree types, planting/harvesting times, replanting in limited cases) and Forest Enterprise staff for sampling.

- Sampling site selection criteria
  - Catchments represent single soil and tree type and management scheme.
  - Catchments have definable boundaries and contain a first-order stream draining them.
  - Catchment areas are small (2 to 5 ha).
  - Sites are completely forested or completely harvested.
  - Site details are available (soil/tree types, planting/harvesting times, replanting in limited cases).
  - Availability of Forest Enterprise staff to collect samples.

- Sampling triggers and logistics
  - Sampling teams carry cleaned bottles for major, minor, and trace-element analysis.
  - Sampling is triggered by CEH weather alerts:
    - Extended dry periods to assess baseflow chemistry.
    - Regional storm conditions to sample stormflow.
  - Samples are taken to the local Forest Enterprise office, then dispatched (usually the day of collection) to CEH Staylittle, mid-Wales, for processing.
  - Next-working-day processing at CEH Staylittle includes pH measurement and Gran titration assays.

- Analytical workflow
  - Remaining samples are filtered (0.45 µm) and filtrates stored for shipment to CEH Wallingford for further chemical analysis.
  - For metal analysis, samples are acidified to prevent storage artefacts.

- Sample handling and storage practices
  - pH measurements: samples stored in glass bottles with immediate analysis on opening to avoid CO2 degassing and pH rise.
  - Storage conditions at Forest Enterprise and CEH offices: dark and at 4°C to minimize storage artefacts.
  - Efforts to avoid artefacts during processing and storage (e.g., acidification, controlled temperatures, dark storage).

- Data and GIS-relevance (data products and integration considerations)
  - Potential GIS outputs include georeferenced sampling sites, catchment boundaries, first-order streams, forested vs harvested status, and associated soil and tree type attributes.
  - Link sampling events to weather-triggered alerts and dates for temporal GIS analysis (baseflow vs stormflow contexts).
  - Maintain provenance through records of site details (soil/tree types, planting/harvesting times), staff involvement, and processing steps (Staylittle, Wallingford) to support data quality and reproducibility.
  - Data should capture measurement types (pH, titration, major/minor/trace metals) and analytical stages for integrated map-based data visualizations.
