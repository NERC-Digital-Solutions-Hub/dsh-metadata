# Monitoring and sampling protocols

- Sampling site design
  - Catchments chosen to represent single soil and tree types and management schemes
  - Each catchment has definable boundaries and contains a first-order stream draining it
  - Catchment areas are small (2 to 5 ha)
  - Sites are either completely forested or completely harvested
  - Site details available (soil and tree types, planting and harvesting times, and limited replanting info)
  - Availability of Forest Enterprise staff to collect samples

- Sampling triggers and objectives
  - Sampling triggered by weather alerts from CEH staff
  - Extended dry periods: assess baseflow chemistry
  - Regional storm conditions: sample stormflow

- Sample collection and handling
  - Teams provided with cleaned plastic and glass bottles for major, minor, and trace elements
  - Samples dispatched mainly on the day of collection to CEH Staylittle
  - At CEH Staylittle (next working day): pH measurement and Gran titration assays
  - Remaining samples filtered (0.45 µM) and filtrates stored for shipment to CEH Wallingford for further analysis
  - Metal analyses: samples acidified before analysis to prevent storage artefacts
  - For pH measurements: samples stored in glass bottles and analyzed immediately on opening to prevent CO2 degassing and pH rise

- Storage and preservation
  - At Forest Enterprise and CEH offices: samples stored in the dark at 4°C to minimize storage artefacts

- Data quality and governance implications
  - Protocols emphasize timely processing, standardized filtration and analysis, and careful storage to ensure data integrity
  - Clear chain of custody and collaboration between Forest Enterprise, CEH Staylittle, and CEH Wallingford support data consistency and usability across sites and analyses
