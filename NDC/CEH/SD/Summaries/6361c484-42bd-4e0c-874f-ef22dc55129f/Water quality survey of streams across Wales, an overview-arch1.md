# Water quality survey of streams across Wales: runoff form forested and felled catchments draining a range of soil types

## Overview
- A dataset from a Welsh water quality survey of small streams draining forested and felled catchments.
- Part of a joint NERC, Environment Agency, and Forestry Commission study on the impacts of conifer harvesting and replanting on upland water quality (Neal et al., 1998).

## Data features
- Extensive measurements across major, minor, trace, and ultra-trace elements, plus nutrients and standard water quality metrics (pH, Gran alkalinity).
- Data provided in raw form (not edited to exclude < values), enabling detailed statistical analysis; users can adjust with methodological metadata to prepare edited datasets.

## Sampling design and period
- Opportunistic sampling with Forest Enterprise staff.
- Aimed to capture baseflow (dry conditions) and stormflow (very wet conditions) to assess groundwater and soil endmember chemistries.
- Catchments: small (2–5 ha), with single tree and soil type at each site.
- Sampling frequency: 1 to 10 samples per site, depending on feasibility.
- Timeframe: 7 September 1995 to 18 November 1997.

## Location and metadata
- Site locations accompanied by grid references and information on soil types, tree species, and felling dates.
- Field sampling protocols and other pre-analysis procedures documented.
- Metadata includes analytical methods, detection levels, and other processing details to enable alignment with standard protocols for edited data.

## Data handling and usability
- Metadata files describe analytical methods, detection levels, site characteristics, and sampling protocols prior to chemical analysis.
- Datasets can be adjusted to standard protocols using metadata; data provenance and methods are documented for reproducibility.

## Reference and how to use
- Findings and scope are described in Neal et al. 1998: The impacts of conifer harvesting on runoff water quality: a regional survey for Wales.
