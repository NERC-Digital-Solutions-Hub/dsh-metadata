# Water quality survey of streams across Wales: runoff form forested and felled catchments draining a range of soil types

## Overview
- Joint study (NERC, Environment Agency, Forestry Commission) examining how conifer harvesting and replanting affect upland water quality in Wales.
- Focuses on small catchments (2–5 ha) across Wales with varying soil types and tree species.
- Provides a comprehensive set of water quality measurements across multiple sampling events and conditions.

## Data content
- Water quality parameters: major, minor, trace, and ultra-trace elements; nutrients; pH; Gran alkalinity.
- Sampling conditions: baseflow (dry periods) and stormflow (very wet periods) to capture groundwater and soil endmember chemistries.
- Spatial scope: Wales-wide survey with site-level metadata; grid references for site locations.
- Temporal scope: 7 September 1995 to 18 November 1997.
- Sampling intensity: 1–10 samplings per site, depending on feasibility.

## Sampling design and site details
- Opportunistic sampling conducted with Forest Enterprise staff.
- Sites selected to vary single tree and soil type at each location.
- Catchment size consistently 2–5 ha.
- Data designed to support analysis of the impacts of forestry operations on water quality under varying hydrological conditions.

## Data quality, methods, and metadata
- Data presented in raw form; no editing to remove less-than values, enabling detailed statistical analysis.
- Metadata includes:
  - Analytical methods and detection levels.
  - Site location information (grid references) and associated attributes (soil types, tree species, felling dates).
  - Field sampling protocols and other pre-analytical procedures.
- Metadata provides a pathway to convert the raw dataset into a standardized, edited dataset if desired.

## Usage, access, and citation
- Refer to Neal et al., 1998 for scope and findings; citation requested when using/publishing material from this dataset.
- Open access paper available via Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (link provided in the reference).

## GIS and mapping implications
- Precise site locations (grid references) enable spatial mapping of water quality indicators.
- Ability to link water chemistry with soil types, tree species, and conifer harvesting dates for spatial analyses.
- Small catchment scale (2–5 ha) suitable for detailed, map-based visualization of spatial patterns and endmember chemistry.
- Data can be integrated with watershed boundaries, land-use layers, and hydrological models to assess impacts of forestry practices on stream water quality.
