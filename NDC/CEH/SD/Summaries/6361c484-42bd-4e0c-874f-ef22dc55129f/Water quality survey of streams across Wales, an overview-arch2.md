# Water quality survey of streams across Wales: runoff form forested and felled catchments draining a range of soil types

## Aim and context
- Joint NERC, Environment Agency, and Forestry Commission funded study examining the impacts of conifer harvesting and replanting on upland water quality in Wales.
- Provides a regional assessment of rainfall-runoff water quality across forested and felled catchments.

## Data scope and sampling design
- Small catchments (2–5 ha) with uniform tree species and soil type at each location.
- Opportunistic sampling conducted with Forest Enterprise staff during dry and very wet periods to capture baseflow and stormflow conditions.
- Number of samplings per site ranged from 1 to 10, depending on feasibility.
- Monitoring period: 7 September 1995 to 18 November 1997.

## Measurements and analysis
- Comprehensive suite of water quality measurements: major, minor, trace, and ultra-trace elements.
- Additional standard metrics: nutrients, pH, and Gran alkalinity.
- Aimed at understanding groundwater and soil endmember chemistries and how harvesting activities influence runoff quality.

## Data format and metadata
- Data provided in raw form (not edited to omit values), enabling detailed statistical analysis and observation of raw variations.
- Metadata includes:
  - Analytical methods used, including detection limits.
  - Site locations (grid references) and associated information (soil types, tree species, felling dates).
  - Field sampling and pre-chemical analysis protocols.
- Metadata allows users to adjust data to standard protocols for edited datasets.

## Data availability and use
- Findings and scope discussed in Neal et al., 1998; citation required when using/publishing material from this dataset.
- Open access available via the Hydrology and Earth System Sciences website.

## Relevance for monitoring and use by analysts
- Demonstrates long-term environmental monitoring across varied catchments to assess water quality changes due to forestry activities.
- Provides rich, raw data and extensive metadata suitable for reproducibility, secondary analyses, and integration with other datasets to enhance dataset value and accessibility.
