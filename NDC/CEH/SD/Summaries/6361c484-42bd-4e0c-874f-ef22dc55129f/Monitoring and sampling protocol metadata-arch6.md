# Monitoring and sampling protocols

- The document outlines the selection of sampling sites across Wales and the workflow for collecting, processing, and analyzing water samples for major, minor, and trace elements.

## Sampling site selection criteria
- Each catchment represents a single soil and tree type as well as management scheme.
- Each catchment has a definable boundary and contains a first order stream draining it.
- Catchment areas are small (2 to 5 ha).
- Sites are either completely forested or completely harvested.
- Site details available include soil and tree types, planting/harvesting times (with limited replanting data).
- Availability of Forest Enterprise staff to collect samples.

## Sampling triggers and transport
- Sampling teams use cleaned plastic and glass bottles for collecting samples.
- Sampling is triggered by alerts from CEH staff under appropriate weather conditions:
  - extended dry periods to assess baseflow chemistry
  - regional storm conditions to sample stormflow
- Samples are taken to the local Forest Enterprise office, then dispatched (mainly the day of collection) to CEH Staylittle for processing.

## Sample processing and analysis
- At CEH Staylittle (next working day): pH and Gran titration assays are performed.
- Remaining samples are filtered (0.45 µM) and the filtrates stored in appropriate bottles for shipment to CEH Wallingford for further chemical analysis.
- For metal analysis, samples are acidified to eliminate storage artefacts.

## pH handling and sample storage
- For pH measurements, samples are stored in glass bottles with immediate analysis on opening to avoid carbon dioxide degassing that would raise pH.

## Storage conditions
- At Forest Enterprise and CEH offices, samples are stored in the dark at 4°C to minimize storage artefacts.
