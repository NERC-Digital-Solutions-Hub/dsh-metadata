# Monitoring and sampling protocols

## Overview
- Sampling across Wales to assess baseflow chemistry and stormflow by collecting samples for major, minor, and trace elements.
- Sampling triggered by weather conditions to capture different hydrological states; samples processed and analyzed through a multi-site workflow.

## Site selection criteria
- Each catchment represents a single soil and tree type and management scheme.
- Catchment boundaries are definable and contain a first-order stream draining it.
- Catchment areas are small (2 to 5 hectares).
- Sites are either completely forested or completely harvested.
- Availability of site details including soil/tree types, planting/harvesting times (and limited replanting data).
- Availability of Forest Enterprise staff to collect samples.

## Sampling protocol and triggers
- Sampling teams provided with a variety of cleaned bottles for major, minor, and trace elements.
- Sampling triggered by CEH weather alerts for:
  - Extended dry periods (to assess baseflow chemistry).
  - Regional storm conditions (to sample stormflow).

## Sample handling and processing
- Samples transported from local Forest Enterprise offices to CEH Staylittle the same day or next day for processing.
- At CEH Staylittle (next working day):
  - pH and Gran titration assays performed.
- Remaining samples:
  - Filtered (0.45 µm) and filtrates stored for shipment to CEH Wallingford for further chemical analysis.
- For metal analyses:
  - Samples acidified to prevent storage artefacts.
- For pH measurements:
  - Samples stored in glass bottles with immediate analysis on opening to avoid CO2 degassing and pH rise.

## Storage and artefact control
- At Forest Enterprise and CEH offices, samples stored in the dark at 4°C to minimize storage artefacts.

## Data flow and analysis
- pH and titration data generated at Staylittle; subsequent chemical analyses conducted at Wallingford.
- Full data pipeline supports integration of field samples with laboratory measurements to support downstream interpretation.
