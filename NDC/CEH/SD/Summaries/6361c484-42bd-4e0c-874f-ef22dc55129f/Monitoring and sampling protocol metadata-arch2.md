# Monitoring and sampling protocols

- Purpose and design
  - Sampling sites across Wales chosen to represent single soil and tree types and management schemes within definable catchments.
  - Each catchment contains a first-order stream, is small (2–5 ha), and is either completely forested or completely harvested.
  - Site details (soil and tree types, planting/harvesting times, replanting in limited cases) and availability of Forest Enterprise staff are required.

- Site selection criteria
  - Catchment represents a single soil and tree type and management scheme
  - Definable boundary with a first-order stream draining it
  - Small catchment areas (2–5 ha)
  - Fully forested or fully harvested
  - Availability of site details and tree/soil information
  - Availability of Forest Enterprise staff to collect samples

- Sampling triggers and methods
  - Sampling teams use cleaned plastic and glass bottles to collect samples for major, minor, and trace elements
  - Sampling triggered by CEH alerts for appropriate weather conditions:
    - Extended dry periods to assess baseflow chemistry
    - Regional storm conditions to sample stormflow

- Sample handling, processing, and transport
  - Samples collected and delivered to the local Forest Enterprise office; dispatched the day of collection to CEH Staylittle for processing
  - At CEH Staylittle (next working day): pH and Gran titration assays performed
  - Remaining samples filtered (0.45 µm); filtrates stored in appropriate bottles for shipment to CEH Wallingford for further chemical analysis
  - Metal analyses: samples acidified to prevent storage artefacts
  - pH measurements: samples stored in glass bottles with immediate analysis on opening to prevent CO2 degassing and pH rise
  - Storage conditions: samples stored in the dark at 4°C to minimize storage artefacts

- Data quality and standardisation implications
  - The protocol establishes a standardised approach for sample collection, processing, and storage to support consistent monitoring of environmental health and policy-relevant chemistry across sites.
