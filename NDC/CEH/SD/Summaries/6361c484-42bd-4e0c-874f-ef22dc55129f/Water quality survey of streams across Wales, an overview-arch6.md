# Water quality survey of streams across Wales: runoff form forested and felled catchments draining a range of soil types

- Overview
  - A dataset from a survey of water quality in small streams draining forested and felled catchments across Wales.
  - Measurements include major, minor, trace, and ultra-trace elements, nutrients, pH, and Gran alkalinity.
  - Opportunistic sampling with Forest Enterprise staff to capture baseflow (dry weather) and stormflow (very wet weather) conditions.
  - Part of a joint NERC, Environment Agency, and Forestry Commission study on impacts of conifer harvesting and replanting on upland water quality.
  - Sites are 2–5 ha, with a single tree and soil type characterized at each location; sampling occurred from 7 September 1995 to 18 November 1997.

- Data content and format
  - Data are provided in raw form (not edited to exclude values below detection), enabling detailed, granular analysis.
  - Includes a metadata file with analytical methods, detection limits, and related information to adjust the dataset to standard protocols for an edited dataset.
  - Metadata describes site locations (grid references), soil types, tree species, felling dates, and field sampling protocols prior to chemical analysis.

- Sampling details
  - Number of samplings per site ranges from 1 to 10, depending on sampling feasibility.
  - Focus on small catchments (2–5 ha) with consistency of tree/soil type at each site.
  - Sampling covers baseflow and stormflow scenarios to assess groundwater and soil endmember chemistries.

- Usage and processing guidance
  - To facilitate standardized use, leverage the metadata on analytical methods and detection limits to convert to standard presentation formats.
  - The dataset is suitable for researchers seeking a detailed view of water quality differences and for statistical analyses without censorship biases.
  - When publishing results, cite Neal et al. (1998).
