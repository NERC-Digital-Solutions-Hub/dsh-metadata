# Automatic detection of open and vegetated water bodies using sentinel 1 to map African malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats

## Overview
- Presents a method to automatically detect open water and vegetated water bodies using Sentinel-1 SAR data.
- Aims to map African malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats to inform surveillance and control efforts.
- Produces data products (maps) that can support health and environmental decision-making and planning.

## Data Used
- Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data (open, globally available), leveraged to differentiate water surfaces under varying vegetation and surface conditions.

## Methods and Workflow
- Automated detection workflow that distinguishes open water from vegetated water bodies based on radar backscatter properties.
- Emphasizes scalability and repeatability across large geographic areas for broad malaria vector habitat mapping.
- Generates regional to continental-scale maps of water body types relevant to mosquito breeding sites.

## Outputs and Data Products
- Maps identifying open water versus vegetated water bodies.
- Spatial datasets suitable for integration with other malaria surveillance data and environmental layers.
- Data products intended to support routine monitoring and targeted vector control interventions.

## Relevance to Data Support archetype
- Demonstrates transforming raw satellite data into actionable data products that non-specialists can use for exploration and decision-making.
- Highlights end-to-end workflow: data acquisition, automated processing, product generation, and dissemination.
- Provides a scalable approach to combine and analyze remote sensing data to answer domain-specific questions (malaria vector habitats).

## Practical Considerations and Challenges
- Potential difficulties in accurately classifying water surfaces under varying vegetation density and environmental conditions.
- Validation requires reliable ground truth or external datasets to assess accuracy.
- Dependence on SAR data availability and revisit times, which can influence temporal analyses and updates.

## Implications for Data Use and Sharing
- Supports open, data-driven mapping of disease-relevant habitats, enabling broader reuse by researchers, policymakers, and health agencies.
- Offers a repeatable framework that can be adapted to other regions or environmental targets beyond malaria vector habitats.
