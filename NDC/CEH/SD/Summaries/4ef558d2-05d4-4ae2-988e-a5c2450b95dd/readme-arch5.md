# Automatic detection of open and vegetated water bodies using sentinel 1 to map African malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats

## Publication context
- Open Access article (Remote Sensing, 2019) by Hardy et al.
- Focuses on automatic detection of open and vegetated water bodies using Sentinel-1 SAR data to map malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats in Africa.

## Data sources and outputs
- Primary data source: Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar imagery.
- Generated outputs: maps identifying open water bodies and vegetated water bodies, aimed at informing malaria vector habitat mapping.

## Metadata and documentation needs
- Requires thorough metadata describing:
  - Sensor specifics, acquisition parameters, and temporal coverage
  - Processing workflow and classification/detection methods
  - Spatial resolution, coordinate reference system, and data provenance
  - Accuracy assessments and validation results

## Data access, licensing, and sharing
- Publication is Open Access; check accompanying data licenses or portal terms before reuse.
- Ensure clear licensing for any derived datasets and provide persistent identifiers (DOIs) where appropriate.

## Data quality, limitations, and risk management
- SAR-specific challenges (e.g., speckle) and potential misclassification between open water and vegetation.
- Sensitivity to seasonal and environmental changes; may require ground truth for validation.
- Limitations related to spatial resolution and data availability across study regions.

## Governance, provenance, and interoperability
- Document data lineage from raw Sentinel-1 to final products; track processing steps and any transformations.
- Ensure interoperability with other hydrological or ecological datasets (e.g., GBIF, hydrology layers) and standard vocabularies.

## Data stewardship and lifecycle considerations
- Versioning and update workflows for new imagery or reprocessed datasets.
- Data storage strategy for large SAR datasets; metadata-driven cataloging in data portals.
- Chasing up data creators when metadata or data quality issues are identified; maintain clear communication channels.

## Practical implications for malaria-vector mapping projects
- Enables researchers and public health actors to identify potential breeding habitats at scale.
- Emphasizes the need for accessible, well-documented datasets to support discovery and reuse by a broad user base.
