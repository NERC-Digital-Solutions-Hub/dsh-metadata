# Automatic detection of open and vegetated water bodies using sentinel 1 to map African malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats

- Overview
  - The study develops an automatic detection approach using Sentinel-1 SAR data to identify open water and vegetated water bodies.
  - Objective is to map African malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats, supporting malaria control and environmental monitoring.
  - Emphasizes scalable, remote-sensed mapping across potentially large areas.

- Data and Methods
  - Data source: Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar imagery.
  - Method: automated classification to distinguish open water bodies from vegetated water bodies and generate habitat maps.
  - Focuses on producing consistent outputs suitable for monitoring environmental conditions related to malaria vectors.

- Outputs and Applications
  - Outputs: maps detailing open water and vegetated water bodies as potential breeding habitats.
  - Applications: informing malaria vector surveillance, land/water resource management, and regional environmental health assessments.

- Reproducibility, Data Sharing, and Access
  - Published in an Open Access journal, facilitating broad accessibility.
  - Approach lends itself to replication and integration into standard environmental monitoring workflows.
  - Outputs and methodologies can be stored, shared, and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

- Relevance to Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Demonstrates use of established data sources (Sentinel-1) and automated processing to produce standardized, interpretable outputs.
  - Supports verification, quality assurance, and transformation of data into decision-relevant maps.

- Challenges and Opportunities
  - Opportunity to increase data value by integrating these habitat maps with additional datasets (e.g., climate, land cover, socio-economic data) for richer analysis.
  - Emphasizes potential for enabling broader access to underlying data used to generate final outputs.

- Limitations and Considerations
  - Potential classification challenges between open water and vegetated water bodies requiring validation.
  - SAR-based detection may face resolution and accuracy constraints depending on sensor geometry and environmental conditions.

- Implications for Policy and Monitoring
  - Provides a repeatable, data-driven method to monitor habitat suitability for malaria vectors over time.
  - Supports evidence-based policy performance assessments by offering standardized environmental health indicators.
