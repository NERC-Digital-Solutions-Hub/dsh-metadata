# Automatic detection of open and vegetated water bodies using sentinel 1 to map African malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats

## Overview
- Aims to map African malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats by automatically detecting open and vegetated water bodies using Sentinel-1 radar data.
- Offers a scalable remote-sensing approach to identify potential standing water environments linked to malaria transmission.

## Methods (high level)
- Utilizes Sentinel-1 radar imagery to distinguish water bodies from surrounding land.
- Implements an automatic detection framework to classify water bodies as open or vegetated.
- Produces spatial outputs (maps/datasets) suitable for monitoring environmental conditions related to malaria risk.

## Outputs and accessibility
- Provides maps and datasets identifying water bodies relevant to mosquito breeding habitats.
- Published as open-access work, facilitating reuse in monitoring and policy contexts.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Delivers a data-driven indicator of standing water presence, a key environmental health factor for malaria risk assessment.
- Supports objective evaluation of interventions and policy decisions by supplying consistent, repeatable measurements over time and space.

## Data governance and operational considerations for the archetype
- Data source is openly accessible (Sentinel-1), aiding transparency and reproducibility.
- Requires processing capacity and expertise to run radar-based detection workflows.
- Beneficial to accompany outputs with metadata and documentation to ensure clarity on methods, coverage, and limitations.
- Integration with existing datasets may necessitate harmonization of classifications (open vs. vegetated water) and temporal alignment.

## Practical implications for policy and decision-making
- Enables evidence-based targeting of vector control efforts by identifying priority water-holding landscapes.
- Supports monitoring and evaluation of habitat-management strategies through repeatable, comparable spatial products.
- Can inform risk communication by providing clear visualizations of habitat distribution across regions.

## Open access note
- The publication is openly accessible, facilitating broad dissemination and reuse by researchers, policymakers, and monitoring practitioners.
