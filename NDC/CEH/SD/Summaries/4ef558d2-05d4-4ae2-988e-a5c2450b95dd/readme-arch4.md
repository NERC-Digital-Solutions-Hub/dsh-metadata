# Automatic detection of open and vegetated water bodies using sentinel 1 to map African malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats

## Overview
- Presents a method for automatically detecting open and vegetated water bodies to map breeding habitats for malaria vectors in Africa.
- Uses Sentinel-1 satellite data to characterize water surfaces and vegetation states as part of a habitat-mapping workflow.
- Published in Remote Sensing (2019) and noted as Open Access.

## Data sources and accessibility
- Primary data source: Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar imagery, leveraging its all-weather, wide-area capabilities.
- Emphasizes open data practices, enabling broader access and reuse for malaria-relevant mapping efforts.
- Outputs are designed to support scalable, continental- or regional-scale habitat mapping.

## Methods (high level)
- Automated detection approach to identify and distinguish open water from vegetated water bodies.
- Demonstrates workflow for processing SAR data to support linkages between water body types and potential mosquito breeding habitats.
- Focuses on producing usable maps that can inform public health planning and vector control strategies.

## Outputs and potential uses
- Maps delineating open and vegetated water bodies across target regions in Africa.
- Habitat-level insights to support malaria vector surveillance, risk assessment, and targeted intervention planning.
- Findings and methods available to researchers and practitioners for replication and adaptation.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Highlights the value of open satellite data (Sentinel-1) for public health and environmental monitoring.
- Demonstrates a reproducible, automated workflow suitable for cross-organizational use and collaboration.
- Supports co-ownership concepts by providing data products that stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, health agencies) can rely on for decision-making.

## Data governance, quality, and metadata
- Emphasizes transparent processing workflows and documentation to ensure reproducibility.
- Underlines the importance of metadata describing data sources, processing steps, and classifications to enable discovery and reuse.
- Reinforces need for quality checks and validation to ensure reliability of habitat maps.

## Challenges and considerations
- Data resolution and heterogeneity may affect detection accuracy, especially in complex landscapes.
- Validation of identified habitats requires ground-truth or complementary data sources.
- Harmonization across regions and time periods is needed to maintain consistent monitoring.

## Recommendations for practice
- Leverage open SAR data (e.g., Sentinel-1) to support scalable malaria habitat mapping initiatives.
- Develop and share reproducible processing pipelines and code to facilitate cross-team collaboration.
- Prioritize comprehensive metadata, clear provenance, and regular updates to ensure ongoing utility and trust across stakeholders.
- Engage with public health partners to tailor data products to user needs and ensure effective uptake in decision-making.
