# Automatic detection of open and vegetated water bodies using sentinel 1 to map African malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats

## Overview
- Open-access study in Remote Sensing (2019) by Hardy et al.
- Proposes an automated approach to detect open water and vegetated water bodies in Africa.
- Objective: map mosquito breeding habitats for African malaria vectors to support targeted vector control and malaria risk assessment.

## Data and Data Characteristics
- Primary data source: Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery (C-band).
- Focus on distinguishing surface water states (open vs vegetated) that are relevant for mosquito breeding habitats.
- Method designed to be scalable and applicable across large regions in Africa.

## Methodology
- Automatic detection framework to classify water bodies into open water and vegetated water categories.
- Utilizes SAR backscatter signals from Sentinel-1 to differentiate water surface conditions.
- Emphasizes a data-driven approach suitable for informing practical malaria control decisions.

## Outputs and Applications
- Produces spatial maps identifying open and vegetated water bodies linked to malaria vector breeding sites.
- Intended to inform vector control planning, surveillance, and risk mapping by providing data-driven habitat information.

## Significance for Analysts
- Demonstrates how Sentinel-1 SAR data can be harnessed for epidemiologically relevant environmental mapping.
- Supports evidence-based targeting of vector control interventions through automated, scalable analysis.
- Contributes to the integration of remote sensing in public health decision-making for malaria.

## Limitations and Considerations
- Inherent challenges of SAR-based water detection, including variability in backscatter due to surface roughness, wind, and vegetation cover.
- Potential need for ground-truth validation and seasonal considerations to ensure accuracy.
- General caveats about generalizing across diverse African landscapes without local calibration.

## Accessibility and Reproducibility
- Publication is Open Access, facilitating wide reuse and replication.
- The methodology is designed for reproducibility and applicability to other regions or time periods, subject to data availability.
