# Automatic detection of open and vegetated water bodies using sentinel 1 to map African malaria vector mosquito breeding habitats

- Overview
  - Presents an automatic approach to detect water bodies that are potential breeding habitats for malaria vectors across Africa.
  - Uses Sentinel-1 SAR data to identify both open water and vegetated water bodies, enabling habitat mapping in all weather conditions.

- Data and sensors
  - Sentinel-1 radar imagery as the primary data source to distinguish water surfaces from surrounding land and to characterize vegetation on or around water bodies.

- Methodology
  - Develops an automatic detection workflow to classify water bodies into open water and vegetated/water-adjacent categories.
  - Likely leverages SAR backscatter properties and possibly time-series information to differentiate water from land and to assess vegetation presence.
  - Aims to produce consistent, map-ready outputs suitable for GIS analysis and visualization.

- Outputs and GIS products
  - Spatial maps identifying open water and vegetated water bodies.
  - GIS-ready layers that can be integrated with other geospatial datasets (e.g., land cover, climate, elevation) for malaria risk assessment and vector control planning.

- Implications for GIS Specialists
  - Provides scalable, automated data products to support malaria habitat mapping across Africa.
  - Reduces reliance on optical data by enabling all-weather detection, which is valuable in cloudy regions.
  - Facilitates incorporation into map-based decision support tools and policy-oriented analyses.

- Applications and impact
  - Enhances ability to identify and monitor potential malaria vector breeding habitats for targeted interventions.
  - Supports spatial decision-making for public health, environmental management, and policy planning.

- Considerations and limitations
  - Potential challenges in separating open water from vegetated water precisely in complex landscapes.
  - Requires validation data and careful calibration to ensure accuracy across diverse African environments.
  - Handling large SAR datasets and processing workflows suitable for routine production.
