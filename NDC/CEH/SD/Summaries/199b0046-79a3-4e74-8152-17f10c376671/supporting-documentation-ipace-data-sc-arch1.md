# Supporting documentation IPACE data

## Overview
- Focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted in Extension Planning Areas within Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts.
- Target EPAs had ongoing PICSA and MRCS projects focusing on early warning early action and farmer engagement in weather services, with at least one weather station and long-term observational records.
- Purpose: understand spatial resolution and heterogeneity in agro-climatic indices; enable intra- and inter-district comparisons via seasonal calendars guiding discussions on monthly farming activities and climate impacts on decision-making.

## Study design and participants
- 15 FGDs conducted across five EPAs (April–May 2019): 10 with farmers, 5 with Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs).
- Participants: 70 female farmers, 48 male farmers, 21 AEDOs.
- Sampling: farmers selected by AEDOs; inclusion of both genders and lead farmer representatives.
- Language and process: FGDs conducted in Chichewa, audio-recorded, translated, and transcribed by a local research assistant.
- Appendix 1 provides the data collection protocol.

## Data collection instruments and elements
- Data type: qualitative information, including the construction of seasonal calendars.
- Data structure: organized according to a predefined protocol (Appendix 1) with emphasis on monthly maize-growing season activities.
- Key data elements:
  - Interview information (enumerator, date, times, interview code)
  - Participants’ details (names, province, district, municipality, village, GPS coordinates)
  - Household context (area cultivated, crops grown, yields, quality/use)
  - Agricultural practices and scheduling (land prep, planting, weeding, fertiliser, drying, storage)
  - Climate/risk topics (rainfall, dry spells, temperatures, winds, hail; key climate risks; presence/absence of rain; rainfall quantities and durations)
  - Non-climatic factors affecting practices (seed access, labor, fertilizers, crop insurance)
  - Monthly practice prompts (July–June cycles), time required for preparations, and how weather affects decisions
  - Perceived field/crop indicators under good weather
  - Climate risk indexing (top 3 risks for each month)

## Data structure, quality control, and analytical methods
- Data structure: seasonal calendars and supplementary sheets capture month-by-month agricultural decisions and climate events.
- Quality control: cross-checks by researchers and a local research assistant across areas.
- Analytical approach: qualitative data coded and organized by month to derive cause–effect relationships between climate phenomena and farm decisions.
- Protocols ensure traceability and compatibility with subsequent data analysis and reporting.

## Appendix 1: Protocol highlights for focus groups with farmers
- Detailed records to collect per interview:
  - Interview information: enumerator, dates, start/end times, interview code
  - Participants’ information: names, location details, and GPS
  - Background: estimated farm size, crops cultivated, and top crops by area
  - Agricultural practices and climate risk documentation for each month
  - Additional fields: inputs, labor, insurance, and access considerations
- Construction of Crop/Farm Calendar:
  - Document agricultural activities, climate risks, non-climatic conditions, and expected field conditions under good weather
  - Capture perceptions of rain presence, rainfall quantities, dryness, temperatures, winds, hail, soil moisture
  - Record expected indicators of crop status under favorable conditions
  - Compile monthly questions (July through June) to gauge timing, effort, and adjustments
  - Collect information on expected timelines, durations, and weather-triggered decision changes
  - Include sections on key climate risks, and top three risks per month
- Recalling recent extremes:
  - Sheet 2 prompts participants to identify the most critical weather risks per month, use of information, sources and delivery, usefulness to decisions, and potential improvements
  - Explore local knowledge signals for dry/wet seasons and contingency strategies (e.g., drought-tolerant varieties, mulching)

## Weather information usage and impact (Section 3)
- Groups: those who receive weather/climate information vs those who do not
- For receivers: what information is used, sources, delivery method, formats, frequency, usefulness, trust, and conditions enabling use
- For non-receivers: why not, what information would be useful, and preferred delivery channels and formats
- Questions cover optimal timing, usefulness for decision-making, and desired changes to improve utility and impact on agricultural practices

## Relevance for analysis and decision-support
- Provides a rich, structured qualitative dataset aligned with monthly agro-climatic cycles, enabling exploration of correlations between climate information access, interpretation, and farming decisions.
- Facilitates cross-district comparisons and integration with long-term weather station data to assess spatial heterogeneity in agro-climatic indices.
- Supports development of predictive insights on how information delivery, trust, and usability influence adaptation strategies and early action in weather-related agricultural decision-making.
