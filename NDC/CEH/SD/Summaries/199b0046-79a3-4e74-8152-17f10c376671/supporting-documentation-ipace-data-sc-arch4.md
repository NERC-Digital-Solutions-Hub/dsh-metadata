# Supporting documentation IPACE data

- Objective and scope
  - Focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted in Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts to understand agro-climatic decision-making and weather services delivery.
  - EPAs chosen have PICSA and MRCS projects with at least one long-term weather observation station; design enables analysis of spatial resolution and heterogeneity in agro-climatic indices.
  - Aim to inform early warning and farmer engagement in weather services delivery; compare intra- and inter-district variations.

- Study design and participants
  - 15 FGDs conducted between April and May 2019 across five EPAs; 10 with farmers and 5 with Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs).
  - Participants: 70 female farmers, 48 male farmers, and 21 AEDOs; farmers include lead farmers; age ranges 20s–50s.
  - Discussions in local language (Chichewa); audio-recorded, then translated and transcribed by a local research assistant.
  - Recruitment: farmers selected by AEDOs; gender balance and representation of diverse farming roles.

- Data collection framework and elements
  - Qualitative data focused on monthly maize growing-season activities, climate impacts on farming decisions, and the use of weather information.
  - Data structured according to a predefined protocol (Appendix 1) with:
    - Interview information (enumerator, date/time, interview code)
    - Participants’ information (location, village, GPS coordinates)
    - Background information (household area cultivated, crops grown, yields, and usage)
    - Crop/farm calendar capturing agricultural practices, climate risks, field/crop conditions, and non-climatic factors (e.g., seed accessibility, labor, inputs)
  - Emphasis on constructing a Crop/Farm Calendar including:
    - Field activities (land prep, planting, weeding, fertilization, drying, storage)
    - Climate risk indicators (rainfall, temperatures, drought spells, pests, moisture)
    - How practices respond to climate risks and what indicators are used to anticipate conditions
  - Inclusion of key climate-related questions to capture:
    - Main climate risks and their timing
    - Actual or perceived extreme events and their impacts
    - Local knowledge and signs used to predict seasonality
    - Adaptation strategies (e.g., choice of crops, management techniques)

- Use of weather and climate information
  - Participants categorized by whether they receive weather/climate information.
  - For recipients: what information is used, source, format, frequency, perceived usefulness, and trust; how information informs decisions; desired improvements and delivery mechanisms (e.g., extension officers, radio, SMS).
  - For non-recipients: barriers to access and what information would be useful if available; preferred delivery formats and timing.
  - Detailed prompts cover usefulness, conditions needed to use information, and potential changes to information delivery to support agricultural practices.

- Analysis approach
  - Qualitative data coded and organized by the maize growing season month to identify cause-effect relationships between climate events and farming decisions.
  - Extraction of farmer responses on climatic phenomena that affected crop management and timing.

- Data quality, governance, and documentation
  - Quality control through cross-checks by researchers and the local assistant.
  - Clear data structure and documentation to ensure consistency across areas and researchers.
  - Appendix 1 provides standardized data collection fields to support reproducibility and future data discovery.

- Practical implications for data leadership
  - Demonstrates a structured approach to collecting rich, contextual climate and farming decision data that can feed early warning systems and farmer support tools.
  - Highlights the need for transparent metadata, standardized data collection protocols, and consideration of user needs (farmers and AEDOs) in data product design.
  - Emphasizes addressing data gaps (e.g., data granularity, data accessibility) by integrating qualitative insights with existing observational data from weather stations and ongoing projects (PICSA, MRCS).

- Appendices and protocol details (Appendix 1)
  - Detailed protocol for FGDs, including interview and participant records, background information, and specific prompts for building the crop calendar and recording climate risks.
  - Structured templates for month-by-month analysis and for recalling/extremes to facilitate consistent data capture across sites.
