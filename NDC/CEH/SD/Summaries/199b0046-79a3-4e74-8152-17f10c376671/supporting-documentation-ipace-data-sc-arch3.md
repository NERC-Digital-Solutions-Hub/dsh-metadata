# Supporting documentation IPACE data

## Overview
- Describes a qualitative data collection effort in Malawi to understand how farmers perceive and use climate information for agricultural decisions.
- Focuses on early warning, farmer engagement, and weather services delivery within districts that host weather stations and ongoing PICSA/MRCS projects.
- Aims to capture monthly agro-climatic activities, climate risks, and decision-making to inform climate services and adaptation strategies.

## Study setting and participants
- Location: Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) in Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts.
- Criteria: EPAs with ongoing PICSA and MRCS projects and at least one long-term weather station; allow intra- and inter-district comparison.
- Participants: 15 focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted April–May 2019 (5 EPAs, 10 with farmers, 5 with Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs)); total 70 female and 48 male farmers, and 21 AEDOs.
- Language and logistics: FGDs conducted in Chichewa, audio recorded, translated, and transcribed by a local research assistant.
- Rationale for method: FGDs chosen to enable rich group interaction around topics of climate services and farming decisions.

## Data collection methods
- Primary method: Focus Group Discussions with farmers and AEDOs to elicit group perspectives on climate services, farming calendars, and extreme weather experiences.
- Data capture: Qualitative data and seasonal calendars embedded in discussions to link climate factors with maize growing decisions.
- Documentation: Appendix 1 provides the data collection protocol and field-recording instruments.

## Data elements and structure
- Qualitative data and seasonal calendars: Used to map climate factors to monthly farming activities and decision-making.
- Required elements (where applicable):
  - Collection/generation methods
  - Quality control (cross-checking by researchers and local assistants)
  - Details of data structure (aligned with the data collection protocol)
  - Analytical methods (coding data by maize growing month; extracting responses on climate events and management timing)
- Data structure: Protocol-based organization of data, with emphasis on the seasonal calendar and monthly breakdowns of practices and climate risks.

## Appendix 1: Protocol for focus groups with farmers
- Interview information: Enumerator name, date, start/end times, interview code.
- Participants’ information: Names, province, district, local municipality, village, GPS coordinates.
- Background information: Estimated area cultivated, crops grown, yield, and use (domestic/trading/fodder).
- Crop/Farm calendar construction: 
  - Agricultural practices (land prep, planting, weeding, fertilization, drying, storage)
  - Climate risks (rainfall, temperatures, pests, moisture, etc.)
  - Non-climatic conditions affecting practices (insurance, seed access, labor, fertilizers)
  - Month-by-month prompts for practices, time needed to implement decisions, and how conditions affect decisions
  - Expected field/crop conditions under good weather
  - Key climate-related risks (top 3)
  - Additional questions on decision impact, adaptation options, and timelines
- The protocol emphasizes month-specific prompts (July through June) for practices, climate risks, and expected outcomes.

## Use of weather and climate information (for farmers)
- Framework for categorizing farmers as users or non-users of weather/climate information.
- For users: questions about information used, sources, reception mechanisms, helpfulness for decisions, trust, usefulness, preferred formats, and timing.
- For non-users: questions about barriers to usage, information that would be useful if available, and preferred delivery mechanisms and formats.
- Additional inquiries cover frequency of reception, the conditions needed to enable use (e.g., access, comprehension, timely delivery), and potential improvements to information flow.

## Recalling and describing recent extreme seasons/years
- Guided discussions (Sheet 2 prompts) to identify:
  - The most critical weather risks/events affecting crops and whether information was used
  - Sources and modes of information reception
  - Helpfulness for crop decisions and desired improvements
  - Local knowledge indicators for dry/wet seasons
  - Coping strategies (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching, crop diversification) when dry spells are anticipated

## Analytical approach and quality control
- Analytical approach involves coding qualitative data by month of the maize growing season to derive cause–effect relationships between climate events and farming decisions.
- Quality control includes cross-checking data across researchers and the local research assistant to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Data is structured according to the predefined protocol to facilitate comparability and potential replication.

## Key takeaways for monitoring and data governance
- The document demonstrates a structured, protocol-driven approach to collecting qualitative climate and agricultural data, with explicit data collection elements, quality control, and an emphasis on linking climate information to real-world farming decisions.
- It captures both the availability and the perceived usefulness of weather/climate information for farmers, including barriers to access and preferred delivery formats.
- The inclusion of appendices and standardized forms supports data transparency, reproducibility, and potential integration into monitoring frameworks that evaluate climate services and farmer decision-making.
