# Supporting documentation IPACE data

## Objective and scope
- Document describes the data collection and protocol used for IPACE-related qualitative climate and farming data.
- Focus: understanding agro-climatic indices, farmer decision-making, and the influence of climate services on farming in Malawi.
- Location and sampling: Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) conducted in Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) within Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts; EPAs selected where PICSA and MRCS projects are active and where weather stations with long-term data exist.
- Rationale: enables assessment of spatial resolution and heterogeneity (intra- and inter-district) in agro-climatic factors.

## Data collection methods and participants
- Method: Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) used to engage farmers and Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs) and to discuss monthly agricultural activities and climate-related decision-making.
- Sessions: 15 FGDs conducted between April and May 2019 across five EPAs.
  - 10 FGDs with farmers; 5 FGDs with AEDOs.
- Participants: 70 female farmers, 48 male farmers, 21 AEDOs.
- Selection: Farmers selected by AEDOs; included lead farmers; both genders represented.
- Language and logistics: FGDs conducted in Chichewa; facilitated by a local research assistant; discussions audio-recorded, translated, and transcribed.
- Data collection tools: Appendix 1 protocol and sheet-based templates for interviews and focus groups.

## Data elements and units
- Qualitative data and seasonal calendars derived from FGDs.
- Data structure aligns with the data collection protocol (Appendix 1), including:
  - Interview information (enumerator, date, time, interview code).
  - Participants’ information (names, location, village, GPS coordinates).
  - Background and farm characteristics (household area cultivated, crops grown, yield, purpose of use).
  - Crop/farm calendar components (agricultural practices, field/crop conditions, climate risks, rainfall details, non-climatic constraints).
  - Month-by-month breakdown of agricultural decisions, preparations, and perceptions of climate conditions.
  - Perceived climate risks (top risks, timing, and impact on decisions).
- Analytical focus: link climate events to crop management decisions and timing.

## Analytical methods
- Qualitative data coding: organize climate and farm decision-making information by maize growing season month.
- Extraction: identify responses about specific seasonal climatic phenomena and their effects on crops and management decisions to derive cause–effect relationships.

## Data structure and quality control
- Data structure follows Appendix 1 protocol (interview info, participants, background, crop information, calendar, climate risks, and decision-making prompts).
- Quality control: cross-checks performed by researchers and a local research assistant to ensure consistency across areas.

## Data management, storage, and accessibility
- Data are organized and prepared to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
- Outputs are designed to be presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) to support monitoring and policy analysis.
- Appendix 1 provides detailed data collection fields to support standardized data sharing and potential cross-site comparisons.

## Use of weather/climate information by farmers
- Framework differentiates between farmers who receive weather/climate information and those who do not.
- For receivers: what information is used, sources, how it helps decision-making, preferred formats, frequency, trust, and conditions needed to use the information effectively.
- For non-receivers: what information would be helpful and how it could support decision-making.
- Includes questions on expectations for information timing, delivery mechanisms (e.g., extension officers, radio), and desired improvements to usefulness.

## Recalling and describing recent extreme season/year (Section 2.1)
- Participants discuss the most critical weather risks/events affecting crops using a month-by-month structure (Sheet 2, months July to June).
- Topics covered:
  - Nature and impact of extreme events on crops.
  - Whether weather/climate information was used, and its sources and delivery.
  - The usefulness of information for crop decisions and how it could be improved.
  - Local knowledge indicators for seasonality (signs of dry/wet conditions) and strategies to cope with dry spells (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching).
- Aimed outcomes: capture perception of extremes, information usefulness, and adaptive strategies at the farmer level.
