# Supporting documentation IPACE data

- Scope and purpose
  - Presents the data collection methods and structure for IPACE data focusing on climate services, early warning/early action, and farmer engagement.
  - Aims to understand agro-climatic indices, crop decision-making, and how farmers access and use weather information.

- Study setting and context
  - Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) conducted in specific Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) within Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts.
  - EPAs chosen for having PICSA and MRCS projects and at least one long-term weather station to enable spatial resolution and heterogeneity analyses.
  - Discussions guided by monthly agricultural calendars and climate-related extreme events to illuminate decision-making.

- Participants and sampling
  - 15 FGDs conducted between April and May 2019 across five EPAs.
  - Participant groups: 10 FGDs with farmers; 5 FGDs with Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs).
  - Participants included both genders (70 female, 48 male farmers; plus 21 AEDOs).
  - Farmers selected by AEDOs; discussions conducted in local language (Chichewa) and audio recorded, then translated and transcribed.

- Data collection instruments and process
  - Use of seasonal calendars to structure discussions around monthly farming activities and climate services.
  - Data collection protocol detailed in Appendix 1 (interview information, participant information, background data, crops, yields, etc.).
  - Data quality control through cross-checking by researchers and a local research assistant.
  - Data organized according to a predefined collection protocol; seasonal calendars highlighted in the protocol.

- Data elements and structure
  - Qualitative data focused on climate and farm decision-making by month of the maize growing season.
  - Key data types include:
    - Interview information: enumerator, date, time, interview code.
    - Participants’ information: location, village, GPS coordinates, demographics.
    - Agricultural context: crops grown, area, yields, quality/purpose of produce.
    - Crop/farm calendar: practices (land preparation, planting, weeding, fertilization, drying, storage), pest/disease indicators, climatic cues, and non-climatic factors (input access, labor, seeds).
    - Climate risk assessment: presence/absence of rain, rainfall amounts, dry spells, temperatures, winds, hail, soil moisture; top climate risks (participants circle top 3).
    - Expected field conditions under good weather, and signs indicating seasonal changes.
    - Main agricultural decisions by month and time required to implement decisions; effects of weather on decisions.
    - Information use: whether they receive weather information, sources, format, frequency, usefulness, trust, and desired improvements.
    - Local knowledge and adaptation strategies for extreme seasons (e.g., drought, heavy rainfall) and potential coping techniques (alternative seeds, mulching, different crops).

- Appendix 1: Protocol for data collection
  - Detailed forms for recording:
    - Interview information (enumerator, date, time, interview code).
    - Participant information (names, district/municipality, village, GPS coordinates, background data).
    - Household agricultural context (area cultivated, crops, yield, and associated metrics).
    - Crop/farm calendar sections capturing agricultural practices, climate risks, non-climatic conditions, and expected seasonal indicators.
    - Structured prompts for monthly analysis (e.g., July to June) including time to prepare, weather impact, and expectations under good weather.
  - Emphasizes capture of both weather-related and non-climatic factors affecting agricultural practices.

- Analytical approach and data handling
  - Qualitative data coded and organized by maize-growing season month; extraction of climate phenomena linked to adverse impacts and management decisions.
  - Focus on deriving cause-effect relationships between climate factors and crop management decisions.
  - Data structured to enable cross-area comparisons (intra-district and inter-district) using the long-term observational records from weather stations.

- Use of weather/climate information (Section 3)
  - Participants categorized into those who receive weather/climate information and those who do not.
  - For receivers: what information is used, information sources, how it helps decision-making, how it is received (mechanisms), format, frequency, usefulness, trust, and potential improvements.
  - For non-receivers: reasons for not using information, what information would be useful, preferred delivery mechanisms and formats, and how often information would be desired.
  - Aims to understand accessibility, usability, and preferred channels (e.g., extension officers, radio, mobile formats) to improve timely, actionable climate information.

- Temporal scope and recall of extremes
  - Recollection and description of recent extreme seasons/years to understand farmers’ interpretation of extremes, the information accessed, and the effectiveness of that information on decision-making.
  - Probes include identifying specific extreme events, sources and timing of information, usefulness for crop decisions, and desired improvements.
  - Incorporates local knowledge indicators of seasonality (signs indicating upcoming dry or wet seasons) and coping strategies (e.g., drought-resistant practices).

- Outputs and relevance for data products
  - Generated artifacts include monthly crop calendars, agro-climatic indices, and climate-information usage patterns.
  - Structured data supports creation of user-friendly dashboards or reports enabling end users to explore climate-informed agricultural decisions.
  - Results can inform better design and dissemination of climate services, and highlight gaps in data access, interpretation, and adoption among farmers.
