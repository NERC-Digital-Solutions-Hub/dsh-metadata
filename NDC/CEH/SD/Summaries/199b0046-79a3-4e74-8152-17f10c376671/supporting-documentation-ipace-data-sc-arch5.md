# Supporting documentation IPACE data Mandatory elements - Collection/generation methods

## Overview
- Focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted in Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) within Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts.
- EPAs chosen to align with PICSA and MRCS projects on early warning, farmer engagement, and weather services; each has at least one weather station with long-term data.
- Aim to understand spatial resolution and heterogeneity of agro-climatic indices through intra- and inter-district comparisons.
- 15 FGDs conducted between April and May 2019: 10 with farmers, 5 with Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs).
- Participants: 70 female farmers, 48 male farmers, 21 AEDOs; mix of lead farmer representatives; age ranges provided (males 28–58; females 20–54).
- FGDs conducted in Chichewa, audio-recorded, then translated and transcribed by a local assistant.
- Appendix 1 provides the data collection protocol and structure.

## Data collection design and purpose
- FGDs guided by seasonal calendars to map important monthly agricultural activities and climate-related decision-making.
- Method chosen to foster discussion within groups about a topic (agro-climatic indices and farming decisions).
- Data aims include understanding how climatic factors influence agricultural practices and decision timing, and how information on weather/climate is used by farmers.

## Data elements, structure, and recording
- Nature and units: Qualitative data and seasonal calendars; emphasis on drawing and interpreting seasonal patterns.
- Data structure: Structured according to a predefined data collection protocol (Appendix 1); seasonal calendars are integrated as part of the data.
- Quality control: Cross-checking by researchers and a local research assistant to ensure data integrity across areas.
- Analytical methods: Qualitative data coded and organized by maize growing season; extraction of farmer responses about specific climatic events and their impact on crop management and timing to derive cause-effect relationships.

## Appendix 1: Protocol for focus groups with farmers to identify key agro-climatic indices
- Record-keeping fields:
  - Interview Information: Enumerator’s name, date, start/end times, interview code (district, interview number, date).
  - Participants’ Information: Names, province, district/municipality, village, GPS coordinates.
  - Background Information: Household cultivated area (past 12 months), crops grown (ranked top three by area), yield, and usage quality (domestic, trading, fodder, etc.).
- Constructing a Crop/Farm Calendar:
  - Agricultural practices by month (land prep, planting, weeding, fertilization, drying, storage).
  - Observations of weeds, pests, crop health, and moisture.
  - Non-climatic conditions affecting practices (seed accessibility, labor, fertilizer availability, crop insurance).
  - Time requirements for implementing decisions; how weather conditions influence monthly practices.
  - Expected field/crop conditions under good weather; identification of key climate risks.
- 2. Use of weather/climate information (for farmers):
  - Grouping by those who receive vs. do not receive weather/climate information.
  - For receivers: information used, source, format, frequency, usefulness, trust, and conditions needed to act on it.
  - For non-receivers: gaps and desired information, preferred delivery mechanisms and formats, and potential usefulness if access were granted.
  - A comprehensive set of prompts (12+ items) to explore usefulness, timing, delivery, trust, and improvements.
- 2.1 Recalling and Describing Recent Extreme Season/Year:
  - Prompt discussion of the most critical weather risks/events affecting crops.
  - Probes on whether weather/climate information was used, sources, timing, and perceived helpfulness for decision-making.
  - Exploration of local knowledge for seasonality signs and potential strategies for coping with dry spells (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching, crop choices).

## Data governance and stewardship implications
- Standardized data capture with explicit metadata (interviewer, time, location) supports traceability, reproducibility, and data quality assurance.
- GPS coordinates and household-level information enable spatial analysis and integration with agro-climatic datasets.
- Rich qualitative data (transcripts, calendars, and audio) require consistent coding schemes and documentation to maintain interoperability across EPAs.
- Data includes both climate-specific variables (seasonal calendars, rainfall indicators, extreme events) and non-climatic agricultural factors (inputs, labor, seed access), highlighting the need for careful metadata to describe context and scope.
- Privacy and consent considerations implied by collecting participant names and household data; stewardship should ensure appropriate access controls and de-identification where necessary.

## Key takeaways for data stewards
- The document provides a comprehensive, standardized protocol for collecting qualitative climate-agriculture data, enabling consistent metadata, context, and structure across multiple districts and participants.
- Critical data components include interview metadata, participant demographics and location, detailed monthly agricultural practices, climate risk identification, perceived usefulness and trust of weather information, and recall of extreme events.
- The structured approach supports subsequent analysis of cause-effect relationships between climate variables and farming decisions, as well as assessments of information dissemination effectiveness.
- Effective data governance will require maintaining translation/ transcription provenance, ensuring consistent coding of qualitative data, and safeguarding sensitive participant information.
