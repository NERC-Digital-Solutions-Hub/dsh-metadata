# Supporting documentation IPACE data

## Overview and purpose
- Focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted April–May 2019 in Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) within Mangochi, Salima and Zomba districts.
- EPAs selected where PICSA and MRCS projects are active, each with at least one weather station and long-term data.
- Goals: understand spatial resolution and heterogeneity of agro-climatic indices, and how climate information influences farming decisions; support early warning and weather services delivery; enable intra-district and inter-district comparability.
- Participants: 15 FGDs (10 with farmers, 5 with Agricultural Extension Development Officers), 70 female and 48 male farmers, 21 AEDOs; discussions conducted in Chichewa, audio-recorded and translated.

## Data collection methods and instruments
- Method: focus groups with farmers and AEDOs to explore monthly agricultural activities and climate impacts on decision-making.
- Data collection protocol: Appendix 1 provides structured data capture (interview metadata, participant details, agro-climatic observations, and crop calendars).
- Data points include GPS coordinates, village location, household area cultivated, crops grown, yields, and qualitative assessments of climate risks and farming practices.
- Focus groups generate both qualitative data and seasonal calendars to map agricultural activities to climate variables.

## Data elements and structure
- Recorded values include qualitative data and seasonal calendars, with explicit fields for data collection protocol (Appendix 1).
- Core data categories:
  - Interview information: enumerator name, date, time, interview code.
  - Participant information: province, district, municipality, village, GPS coordinates, household land area, crops, and yields.
  - Crop/farm calendar: agricultural practices by month, field/crop descriptions, rainfall presence and amounts, temperature and wind indicators, soil moisture, pests and weeds, non-climatic constraints (e.g., seed access, labor, inputs).
  - Climate risks: identification and ranking of top climate-related risks per month.
  - Information use: sources of weather/climate information, formats, frequency, usefulness, trust, and desired improvements.
  - Extreme-season recall: discussion prompts for critical weather events, sources of information, decision impact, and adaptation strategies.

## Analytical methods
- Qualitative data were coded and organized according to the maize growing season month to derive cause–effect relationships between climate phenomena and farm decisions.
- Data structure emphasizes month-by-month mapping of practices, risks, and responses to enable later GIS integration and spatial analysis.

## Constructing a Crop/Farm Calendar (Section 2)
- Detailed workflow to document:
  - Agricultural practices by month (land preparation, planting, weeding, fertilization, drying, storage).
  - Weather observations (rain presence, rainfall amounts, droughts, temperature, wind, rainfall timing and intensity).
  - Climate risks and their seasonal timing; presence of non-climatic factors affecting decisions.
  - Time requirements for implementing decisions and how weather influences monthly actions.
  - Expected field/crop conditions under good weather to contextualize observed data.

## Use of weather/climate information by farmers (Section 3)
- Classification of farmers into those who receive weather information vs. those who do not.
- For receivers: type of information used, sources, delivery mechanisms, formats, frequency, usefulness, and trust.
- For non-receivers: potential useful information, preferred delivery channels and formats, and conditions needed to enable use (e.g., access, comprehension, timing).
- Questions cover how weather information supports crop decisions and what improvements would enhance usefulness.

## Recalling and describing extreme conditions (Section 2.1)
- Structured prompts to capture:
  - The most critical weather risks/events in the examined periods and their specifics.
  - Whether and how weather information influenced decisions.
  - Information sources, delivery methods, timing, and helpfulness.
  - Local indicators for seasonality and potential adaptation strategies (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching).

## Appendices and protocol specifics
- Appendix 1: Detailed data collection sheet contents, including:
  - Interview metadata and participant information.
  - Household and land-use specifics.
  - Crops grown, area, yields, and crop rankings.
  - Crop/farm calendar sections with months, agricultural practices, climate risks, rainfall details, and field observations.
  - Structured prompts for what farmers expect to see under good weather, key climate risks, and how weather information is received and used.
- The protocol enables standardized data capture across sites and facilitates later geospatial alignment with weather station data and other GIS layers.

## GIS-focused implications and opportunities
- Provides georeferenced, month-by-month agro-climatic data linked to farmer measures (village, district, EPA) suitable for map-based analyses.
- Enables spatial comparisons of agro-climatic indices and farmer responses across EPAs and districts.
- Supports integration with weather station data and extension service delivery channels to map information dissemination and uptake.
- Highlights data standardization, quality assurance, and data transformation needs for GIS readiness (e.g., coding qualitative observations, harmonizing units, linking GPS coordinates to spatial layers).

## Key takeaways for GIS Specialists
- The document outlines a rigorous, georeferenced data collection framework that ties qualitative farmer insights to monthly agro-climatic indices.
- It emphasizes standardized, QA-driven protocols and explicit data elements (including GPS, calendar months, climate risks, and information flows) ideal for creating versatile GIS datasets.
- The collected data support mapping of climate risks, farming practices, information dissemination, and farmers’ adaptive strategies, enabling robust spatial analysis and decision-support visualizations.
