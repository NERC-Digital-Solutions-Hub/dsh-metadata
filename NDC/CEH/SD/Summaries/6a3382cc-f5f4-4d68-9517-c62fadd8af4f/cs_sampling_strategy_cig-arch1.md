# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Document the sampling framework and evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to underpin Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007, with emphasis on stratified random sampling, data structure, and how national and country-level estimates are derived.

- Core ideas
  - Use of stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage across ecological land types.
  - ITE Land Classification as the backbone for stratification, evolving over time to support different reporting units (GB-wide, England with Wales, Scotland, Wales-only).
  - Field sampling tied to a 1 km square sampling unit, with larger-scale environmental attributes driving class delineation.
  - National estimates computed by combining per-class habitat metrics with the area occupied by each class; later emphasis on country-specific estimates.

- Data and methodology highlights
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used in early development to classify land into coherent environmental clusters.
  - Initial sampling (CS1978) of 256 squares across 32 land classes; eight samples per class as a minimum, with surrounding squares classified to extend the landscape context.
  - 1984 CS: sampling increased to 12 squares per class (total 384), retaining the 1978 framework.
  - CS1990: shift to All Squares Land Classification; inclusion of urban/sea corrections; 508 squares surveyed; integration with the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - CS2000: need for separate country estimates led to subdividing land classes into country-unit variants, creating 40 strata (and later 45), plus additional squares to ensure representation; upland habitat module added; Isle of Man samples replaced for country-specific reporting.
  - CS2007: further Wales-focused reporting necessitated new Welsh sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata expanded to 45; additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure Wales-specific precision; some English classes retained with reduced square counts.

- Land Classification and class counts
  - 32 original ITE Land Classes (mid-1970s framework) based on environmental attributes.
  - CS1990 expanded/adjusted classifications; CS2000 increased to 40 classes for country reporting.
  - CS2007 introduced Welsh-specific sub-classes and expanded to 45 strata to support Wales-only reporting.

- Sampling framework by country and uplands
  - England with Wales and Scotland reporting frameworks revised for country-based estimates; classes subdivided by country unit where needed.
  - Wales received targeted augmentation to improve Wales-only precision; adjustments in class composition and sample allocation to maintain adequate representation across Welsh classes.
  - An uplands module in CS2000 added survey squares in upland/marginal upland classes to improve habitat estimates in those focal regions.

- Outputs and reporting
  - CS reports consistently link field survey data to the ITE Land Classification, enabling national habitat area estimates and trend analyses.
  - Tables and figures in the documentation (e.g., class maps, sample square distributions) accompany the reporting of sampling design and results.
  - National estimates discussed in relation to the latest Land Classification in each survey cycle, with caveats on cross-survey comparability when classifications change.

- Key historical progression (overview)
  - 1978: First Land Classification with 32 classes; 256 field squares; eight per class; national estimates via class-area weighting.
  - 1984: Expansion to 12 squares per class; broader sampling for land use features.
  - 1990: All Squares Land Classification; 508 squares; land cover mapping integrated; national estimates tied to updated classification.
  - 1998–2000: Revision to enable Scotland reporting; expansion to 40 classes; regional and country-specific estimations refined.
  - 2007: Wales-specific reporting finalized; introduction of Welsh sub-classes; 45 strata; Wales-focused sampling augmentation.

- Data quality, comparability considerations
  - Changing the basic classification affects consistency of national stock estimates; preference given to using the latest classification for country-specific reports, while preserving historical comparability where feasible.
  - When classifications shift, reallocation of squares to neighboring classes helps maintain stable representation of environment types across surveys.

- Takeaway for analysts
  - Countryside Survey data are built on a robust, stratified sampling framework anchored in a evolving land classification system; country-specific reporting requires deliberate class subdivision and targeted sampling augmentation to maintain precision.
  - When using CS data for trend or impact assessments, align analyses with the corresponding Land Classification version and note any reclassification or sampling changes that could affect comparability across survey years.
