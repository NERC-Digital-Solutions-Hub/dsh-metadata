# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise the public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Background and governance
- Part of the 2018/2019–2024 rolling programme funded by NERC (UK-SCaPE/National Capability).
- CS partners (as of 2007) include UKCEH, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.
- Location confidentiality supported by public-interest rationale; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects future survey integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permissions.
- Public interest to maintain confidentiality to safeguard ongoing scientific policy informatics.

## Circumstances and precision for release
- Circumstances allow approximate identification of squares at a four-digit grid reference under licence.
- If precise (six-digit) locations are essential, UKCEH can perform pre-processing analyses to avoid releasing locations; otherwise exceptional access may be granted under licence.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, require secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals for a defined project.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
- No release to third parties that could compromise square locations.
- Data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or assess individual landowners’ compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP requirements than six-digit releases; license terms prohibit attempts to deduce exact locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences with required clauses.
- UKCEH provides annual reporting on access applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS-partner needs, pre-processing support should be reasonable in timeframe; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data to help define requirements and/or secure appropriate use; collaboration or payment arrangements may be negotiated.

## Practical guidance for potential users
- Consider whether four-digit licensing suffices or whether six-digit locations are essential (with the understanding of stricter confidentiality and IP constraints).
- Plan for secure data handling, project-specific licensing, and eventual data destruction.
- Engage UKCEH early to discuss feasibility, requirements, and necessary governance steps.
