# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Funded by NERC for 2018/2019–2024; originally established by a consortium of UK environmental and governmental bodies.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations kept confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permissions.
- Public-interest rationale; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Circumstances and precision levels for release
- Four-digit grid references (10 km x 10 km grid) may be released under licence when helpful to users.
- Six-digit (precise) locations require pre-processing by UKCEH or exceptional justification; very rare cases require demonstration that IP data are equally or more confidential than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares could identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
- Licences for four-digit references have lighter IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, restrict access to named individuals, and be used for defined projects only.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at project end.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; not to be used to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to prove project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases: no attempts to deduce precise square locations; risk-of-derivation clauses included.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, procedures follow FOI/EIR regulations.
- UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising access applications and decision grounds.
- For practical delivery, UKCEH may provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes under moderate demand; case-by-case for external requests.
- Partners are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to work involving CS location data; assistance may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for Data Stewards
- Ensure governance around requests for CS location data, including authentication of licensees and project scope.
- Manage secure storage and access controls for licensed datasets and enforce finite licensing periods.
- Track and enforce destruction or return of data at licence end; monitor to prevent any misuse or reverse-engineering attempts.
- Coordinate with UKCEH for pre-processing, licensing, and potential support; document approval decisions and grounds.
- Maintain awareness of the balance between data utility (e.g., four-digit references) and confidentiality risks; ensure policy compliance in all sharing activities.
