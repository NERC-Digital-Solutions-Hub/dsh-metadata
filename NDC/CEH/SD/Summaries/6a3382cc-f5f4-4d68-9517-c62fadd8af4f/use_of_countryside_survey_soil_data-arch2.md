# Sampling design

## Purpose and timeline
- Soil sampling conducted for Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019.
- Early years used fixed square sets (1978/1998: 256 squares); 2007 expanded to 591 CS squares; 2019 initiated a rolling survey targeting ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
- Power analyses (Emmett et al. 2008) guided the number of samples to detect significant change.

## Sampling frames and plots
- Soil samples taken from CS X-plots, with 5 X-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates due to variation in land use, soil type, etc.
- Some X-plots are relocated over time due to plot destruction, access issues, or uncertainty about location.
- Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1); samples with the same identifier come from the same location but may be 2–3 m apart around the 2 m × 2 m plot corners.

## Field sampling method
- Soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for the invertebrate sample).
- Methods evolved: 1998–rolling survey (2018/2019–2023) used a hammered soil core; 1978 used soil pits to sample the top 15 cm.
- If 15 cm could not be reached due to stones or shallow soils, an incomplete core occurred.
- Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken in 2007 for some cores.
- The rolling CS survey adopted the core-based method.

## Measurements and lab procedures
- 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1990: some soil mapping undertaken.
- 1998, 2007, and rolling survey (2018/2019–2023): multiple cores per X-plot; different cores carry different measurements.
- No chemical analyses are performed by soil horizons; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 and in 2018/19–2023 (not using ISO bulk density method).
- A full description and implications of methods are detailed in Emmett et al. (2008).

## Data analysis and interpretation
- Analyses should account for statistical issues noted in CS.
- If land class structure is ignored, results reflect stock and change of the population; if land classes are considered, results are weighted national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not consistently used; advise considering the CS structure, and at minimum use a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for multiple X-plots per square.
- CS design uses dispersed observations rather than horizon-specific cores; increases overall precision and regional coverage when estimating national trends.
- Users are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications listed on the CS website.
