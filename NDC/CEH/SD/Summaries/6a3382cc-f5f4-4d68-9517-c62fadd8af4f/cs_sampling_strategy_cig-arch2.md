# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Introduction
- Purpose: The field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year sequence, is built on the ITE Land Classification to enable consistent environmental health monitoring and trend analysis.
- Core idea: Use stratified sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain's diverse landscapes; stratification is based on environmental attributes and land classifications rather than purely random sampling.
- Data workflow: Require understanding, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and standardized outputs (reports, maps, charts); outputs are stored in appropriate data portals.

## The ITE Land Classification: origins and purpose
- Theoretical basis: Stratify land into discrete classes so that different ecological and landscape attributes are represented in the sample; many strata are created by combining environmental factors (not just simple altitude).
- Original approach (mid-1970s): Use environmental attributes to classify 1 km squares, derived from a limited dataset and employing Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on scaled environmental data.
- 1 km square sampling: Center squares of a 15 × 15 km grid were classified (1228 centers), with surrounding 4 squares also assigned to classes; total sample frame encompassed 6039 km squares for initial stratification.

## The Sampling Framework by Survey Year

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
- Framework: 32 ITE Land Classes; 256 field squares surveyed (8 per class) to estimate national habitat areas.
- National estimates: Calculated as the product of mean habitat area per class and the land-class area.

### 1984 – Second Field Survey
- Expansion: 12 squares per class (total 384) surveyed; continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- Outcome: Supported comparisons of landscape change; limitations noted in representing all classes.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990)
- Change: Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB squares; satellite-derived Land Cover Map introduced.
- Survey: 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping from earlier survey.
- National estimates: Based on the revised, all-squares classification; results published in CS1990 main report (1993).
- Practical implication: While classification attempts to reflect all squares, representing all squares with the same level of detail as the original was not feasible; some squares shifted classes.

### 1990s – Development of a New Classification Framework
- Challenge: Need for regional/local estimates and better alignment with policy needs; all GB squares could not be classified at the original resolution.
- Solution: Use climatic, geological, and physiographic factors (or surrogates) to classify squares via multivariate methods; the 1228 original class centers were reclassified with a best-fit approach, resulting in some reassignments and representation shifts.
- Result: Some class distributions were distorted, necessitating adjustments in subsequent surveys.

### 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000): Separate Country Estimates
- Policy need: Distinct reporting for England & Wales vs Scotland (and eventually uplands/habitat status in Wales).
- Changes:
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), creating 40 strata.
  - Aggregation of underrepresented rump classes within each country unit to maintain representation.
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes in each country (minimum 6 per class; 19 extra squares overall; additional distribution to maintain England-Wales balance).
  - Special upland module: 30 extra squares focused on upland habitats in England and Wales for better country-specific accuracy.
- Totals: CS2000 involved substantial reallocation and expansion of sampling to enable reliable country-based estimates.

### 2007 – Developments for Wales-Only Reporting (CS2007)
- Wales-focus: Wales required more robust Wales-only estimates post-devolution; Wales became the most intensively sampled of the three regions.
- Key adjustments:
  - Country-unit subdivisions extended to five new Welsh/England sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Increased Wales sampling: 43 additional squares and a minimum of 6 squares in each Welsh class.
  - England adjustments: Some classes (5e and 15e) retained only 4 squares per class due to precision considerations, deemed acceptable by a 2006 scoping study.
- Welsh-class refinements: Wales-specific sub-division of Land Class 17 into 17w1, 17w2, 17w3.
- Outputs: Revised class maps for England with Wales and Scotland; sample-square maps illustrating the updated framework.
- Summary Table: CS2007 table outlines per-class square counts and sampling rates; total GB sample squares for 2007 reached 591 (England and Scotland combined), with Wales contributing a substantial portion (107 squares).

## Data governance, consistency, and national estimates
- Note on national estimates: Changing the underlying Land Classification affects the consistency of national stock estimates; a balance is sought between cross-survey consistency (using older classifications) and alignment with the latest classification for survey-specific consistency.
- Practical takeaway for analysts: When comparing across surveys, be mindful of classification version used; use the latest framework for within-survey estimates and apply consistent cross-survey mappings for trend analyses.

## Outputs and implications for monitoring
- Outputs produced: Standardized habitat status and change information, country-specific estimates (England & Wales, Scotland), and Wales-focused reporting; maps and tabulated results accompany narrative reports.
- Monitoring implications: The layered approach (stratified sampling, evolving land classifications, country-specific sub-stratification, upland modules) enhances the ability to detect change over time, ensures representation of diverse land uses, and supports policy-relevant reporting.

## Key figures and summaries (high-level)
- Sampling scale evolution: 256 (1978) → 384 (1984) → 508 (1990) field squares; GB-wide sample sizes expanded and refined through CS2000 and CS2007 to support separate country reporting and upland habitat assessment.
- GB-wide class framework: Land Classes expanded from 32 (1978) to approximately 40 (1990) and then to 45 with devolution-driven refinements (CS2007) to accommodate Wales reporting.
- Country-unit approach: Explicit subdivision into England with Wales and Scotland (and Wales-specific refinements) to enable country-focused environmental policy reporting.
- Upland emphasis: Additional sampling module added in CS2000 to improve upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
