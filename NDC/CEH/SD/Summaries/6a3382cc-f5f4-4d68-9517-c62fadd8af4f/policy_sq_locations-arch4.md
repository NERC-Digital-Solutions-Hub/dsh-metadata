# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximise public-interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of survey sites.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
  - Rolling program (2018/2019–2024) funded by NERC; list of CS partners historically includes UKCEH, Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

- Confidentiality rationale
  - Locations are confidential to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land in the future.
  - Public-interest justification; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- When and how locations may be released
  - Approximate locations: four-digit grid references (10 km x 10 km grid) may be released under licence.
  - Precise locations: six-digit grid references require UKCEH to perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing locations; very exceptional cases may grant external release under licence if IP/confidentiality is at least as protected as CS data.
  - Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, etc.) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional-release terms.

- Conditions of release
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to approved individuals for a defined project.
  - Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end of the period.
  - No data to be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; cannot be used to advise or plan visits or to monitor landowners.
  - If requested, licensees may need to show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same IP-level confidentiality as six-digit releases; a clause prohibits attempts to derive precise locations from the data.

- Responsible governance and process
  - UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate terms.
  - If approval is denied, processes align with FOI Act and Environmental Regulations.
  - UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - Internal use within CS partners may require reasonable pre-processing support from UKCEH; external requests are considered case-by-case.
  - Partners are encouraged to consult UKCEH before using CS location data; collaboration or payment may be negotiated as part of proposed work.

- Practical implications for data leaders
  - Establishes a formal, controlled framework balancing data utility with privacy and future survey integrity.
  - Clarifies who controls access (UKCEH on behalf of NERC), licensing processes, and ongoing accountability (annual reporting).
  - Emphasises the need for secure handling, defined project scope, and criteria for exceptional access.
  - Highlights the importance of pre-processing capabilities to avoid disclosure and of engaging with the data custodians early.

- Key takeaways
  - Location data are highly regulated and access is strictly controlled through licences.
  - Four-digit releases are permitted under licence; six-digit releases require exceptional justification and often preprocessing by UKCEH.
  - Any release supports strict confidentiality, finite licensing periods, and destruction of data post-use.
  - UKCEH serves as the central governance point, with annual transparency reporting and collaboration options for CS partners and external requests.
