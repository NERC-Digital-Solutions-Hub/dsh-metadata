# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the development and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey GB from 1978 to 2007.
  - Emphasises the need for a stratified, representative, and repeatable sampling approach to detect change in habitats and land use over time.
  - Addresses the evolution of country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and the eventual Wales upland module.

- Data lineage and classification evolution
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data of 1,228 centre squares (15 x 15 km grid).
    - Extended classification to surrounding squares (total 6,039 km squares) and surveyed 256 squares (8 per class).
    - National habitat area estimates calculated from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (total 384); used the 1978 Land Classification for estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to cover all 1 km squares in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; included repeat vegetation Quadrat data from 1978.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
    - Classification expanded to 40 classes to support Scotland reporting; separate reporting introduced.
    - England/Wales and Scotland results framed for national estimates with updated mapping.
  - 2000 (CS2000; Sampling for England, Scotland, Wales)
    - Addressed representation imbalances from the new classification.
    - Introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) with 40 strata; added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation; additional adjustments to maintain comparable sampling rates across countries.
    - Wales received intensified sampling; Isle of Man squares reallocated.
    - Upland habitat module planned to improve upland estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Welsh reporting and refinement)
    - Wales-specific reporting formalised; added five Welsh country-unit sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
    - Added 43 additional Welsh squares (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class); England had limited adjustments (some classes with 4 squares).
    - England/Scotland maps adjusted accordingly; Wales became the most densely sampled country unit.
    - Welsh upland sampling module further enhanced country-specific estimates.

- Sampling framework and field surveys
  - Core unit: 1 km squares across Great Britain.
  - Sampling design: stratified, random sampling to ensure representation of ecological variation; aim to reduce bias from purely random selection.
  - Initial sampling per survey: at least eight samples per Land Class (CS1978) to derive national estimates; later surveys refined to country-specific reporting.
  - Field survey outputs: habitat and landscape features, with main reports published for each cycle (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) and cross-survey methodological papers.

- Country-specific reporting and data governance implications
  - Separate country units introduced to align with policy/legislation needs (England with Wales; Scotland; later Wales-specific reporting).
  - Classification history affects cross-survey comparability; careful documentation required to map between older classifications and newer country-specific versions.
  - Data inclusions/exclusions (e.g., Isle of Man adjustments) preserved data integrity for national estimates while ensuring country-specific accuracy.
  - Upland module adjustments (CS2000) and Wales upland refinements (CS2007) highlight the need for modular data governance to improve precision in under-sampled areas.

- Documentation, data quality, and accessibility
  - Extensive documentation across reports detailing classification definitions, sampling frames, and methodological changes.
  - Emphasis on traceability: versioned Land Class maps, per-survey sampling counts, and clear rationale for changes to maintain time-series integrity.
  - Data products include main survey reports and accompanying methodological literature to support reproducibility and future data reuse.

- Practical takeaways for Data Stewards
  - Maintain clear version control for Land Class maps and country-specific stratifications (e.g., 32 → 40 → 45 classes; country-unit subdivisions).
  - Preserve historical mappings and provide transparent crosswalks between classifications to ensure comparability across survey years.
  - Ensure metadata captures survey year, country unit, Land Class definitions, sampling rate, and class-specific square counts.
  - Document data provenance, including how changes in classification and sampling frames affect national and country-level estimates.
  - Manage data governance for modular additions (e.g., upland modules) to improve targeted estimates without compromising longitudinal consistency.
  - Acknowledge and plan for representation biases, especially when adjusting sample allocations for country-specific reporting (e.g., Wales enhancements, English class reductions).
  - Facilitate data sharing and reuse by publishing comprehensive methodological appendices and maintaining accessible national estimates alongside detailed class distributions.
