# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aim: maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Funding and partners: 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1, UK-SCaPE National Capability); 2007 CS partners include NERC, CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.
- Rationale for confidentiality: preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, underpinning scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Public-interest stance: decisions on exceptional release are made by UKCEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access framework and release levels
- Allowed releases:
  - Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to indicate which 10 km x 10 km grid square each CS square falls into (useful for area-level analyses such as country, county, ITE land class, or Environmental Zone).
  - Six-digit grid references: released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external parties must demonstrate that their IP/data confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, etc.): release follows the same exceptional-criteria as six-digit location data due to potential identifiability.
- Processing option: if precise location data are essential, UKCEH may perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing exact locations.

## Specific license terms and safeguards
- Licences must:
  - Preserve confidentiality; data stored securely; access limited to named individuals with legitimate need for the project.
  - Be granted for finite periods tied to specific projects; data not retained for other organizational duties.
  - Require written destruction confirmation at licence end.
  - Prohibit release of data or derivatives to third parties that could compromise square locations; do not use to plan visits or verify landowner compliance.
  - Require evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP when applicable.
  - For four-digit releases, terms are similar but do not require the higher IP-confidentiality criteria; still prohibit attempts to pinpoint precise square locations.
- Licences include a clause preventing users from deriving exact square locations or claiming to have done so.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Decision-maker: UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, approves exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with applicable clauses.
- If access is denied: CS partners can rely on FOI/Regulations procedures supporting the decision.
- Reporting: UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Practical support: UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; other organisations can request case-by-case consideration.
- Consultation recommendation: CS partners and potential data users are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to data use; involvement can be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Data utility balanced with stewardship: allows higher-level spatial analysis (area-based tagging and monitoring) without revealing precise square locations.
- Workflow considerations:
  - Plan licensing early and coordinate with UKCEH.
  - Use four-digit grid releases for broad spatial analyses; resort to six-digit releases only under exceptional justification.
  - If precise analysis is necessary, leverage UKCEH pre-processing to avoid disclosing exact sites.
  - Ensure compliance with secure storage, limited access, and destruction requirements.
- Public-facing data remains accessible; the policy specifically governs confidential location data and its controlled release.
