# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy to maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Part of a rolling program funded by NERC (UK-SCaPE), 2018/2019–2024, award NE/R016429/1.
- Original partners (2007) include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Maintains representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys’ scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing access permission from landowners.
- Confidentiality considered in the public interest; requests handled by UKCEH for the CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision
- External use may identify whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10 km x 10 km) may be released under licence to indicate square location.
- Precise six-digit locations released only in very exceptional circumstances; external requests must be processed by UKCEH to avoid release if possible.
- If precise location data are essential, organisations must demonstrate, legally, that their data/models require equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data from within survey squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP-confidentiality threshold.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed after the period.
- No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check compliance by landowners.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar terms, but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases; a clause prevents users from deriving precise locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative from the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH will follow FOI Act and Environmental Regulations procedures.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For practical use, UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; other organisations’ requests are case-by-case.
- It is strongly recommended that potential data users consult with UKCEH before committing to CS location data use; UKCEH involvement may be collaborative or paid and is negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for GIS specialists
- Access to confidential CS square locations is controlled and licensed; assess whether your use requires four-digit or six-digit data.
- Understand licensing terms, renewal periods, and retention/destruction requirements.
- Coordinate with UKCEH early to determine feasibility and required pre-processing.
- Ensure data handling complies with confidentiality, security, and JCOP-aligned management standards.
