# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Sets rules for access to CS survey square location data and spatial data within squares.
- Aims to maximise public-benefit use of data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Other CS data remains publicly accessible.

## Background and Governance
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), award NE/R016429/1, part of the UK-SCaPE programme.
- Original CS partners include NERC (UKCEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Confidentiality Rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and securing landowner permission.
- Requests handled by UKCEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) under the Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access and Release Rules
- Public-use checks can identify whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10 km grid) may be released under licence when approximate location is sufficient.
- Six-digit grid references (precise) require pre-processing by UKCEH to avoid release; very exceptional cases may grant external release if the requester demonstrates IP confidentiality requirements equal to or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional release conditions.

## Licensing Conditions and Use
- Licences: confidentiality must be preserved; secure storage; access restricted to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the licence period.
- No third-party disclosure that could compromise square locations.
- Data cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Prohibition on attempts to derive precise locations from data; may require evidence of project-management standards equivalent to JCOP.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- CS data owners; UKCEH decides on exceptional releases on behalf of NERC.
- UKCEH issues hardcopy licences containing confidentiality clauses; sign-off by authorized representatives.
- If approval is denied, decisions follow FOI/Regulations procedures.
- UKCEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- Reasonable pre-processing support from UKCEH during moderate demand; other organisations treated case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to CS location data use; collaborative or paid support may be negotiated.
