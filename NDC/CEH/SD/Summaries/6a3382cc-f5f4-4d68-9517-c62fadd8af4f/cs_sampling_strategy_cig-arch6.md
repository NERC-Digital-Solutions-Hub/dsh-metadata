# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Built on and evolves from the ITE Land Classification, which stratifies Great Britain into land classes for representative sampling.
  - Aims to understand ecological and habitat change over time and to provide robust, country-specific estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and, later, Wales-only reporting.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified random sampling: dividing land into discrete strata (land classes) to ensure representative sampling across varied landscapes.
  - Land Classification as the sampling framework: environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) define classes; class composition drives sample allocation.
  - Sample unit: 1 km x 1 km squares; early work used centre squares of larger grids with surrounding squares classified.
  - National estimates: derived by combining class-level areas with per-square habitat estimates within each class (and adjustments for country units).

- Evolution of the Land Classification and sampling (timeline highlights)
  - 1978 (Initial survey)
    - 32 ITE Land Classes derived from 1228 centre 1 km squares; 8 squares per class surveyed (total 256).
    - National habitat estimates calculated from mean habitat area per square within each class and the total area of each class.
  - 1984 (Second survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); used the 1978 Land Classification framework.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd survey)
    - Expanded classification to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - First linkage to the Land Cover Map from satellite imagery; most features updated from the 1984 survey.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th survey)
    - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; enabled Scotland-only reporting; sample size increased to 569 squares.
  - 2000 (Countryside Survey CS2000)
    - Introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland); subdivided and aggregated Land Classes to create 40 strata tailored to country units.
    - Added 19 extra squares to ensure representation of new classes; uplands module added to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - 2007 (Countryside Survey CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting needs led to further Welsh-specific class subdivisions (creating 5 new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and a total of 45 strata.
    - 43 additional squares in Wales to ensure adequate representation; two English classes (5e, 15e) retained with fewer squares (still considered adequate for reporting).
    - Total sampling adjusted to reflect Wales emphasis while maintaining England/Scotland comparability.

- Country-specific sampling and outputs
  - CS2000: framework reorganized into country units; 40 strata; additional country-focused sampling.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused adjustments increased Welsh sampling and precision for Wales-only reporting; England-adjusted classes preserved overall balance.
  - Outputs include country-specific habitat estimates, Land Class maps, and cross-year trend data suitable for policy and planning.

- Data products and use
  - Field survey data on habitat areas and land cover by Land Class.
  - Environmental stratifications enabling robust national and sub-national estimates.
  - Reports and maps linking field measurements to land classifications and country units (England with Wales; Scotland; Wales-specific reporting in later years).

- Data quality, challenges, and considerations
  - Ensuring representative sampling across many landscape types; early sampling used center squares to manage computational and data constraints.
  - Shifts in classification (e.g., 1990 All Squares vs. earlier frameworks) affected cross-year comparability and required careful handling for national estimates.
  - 2006 scoping study highlighted Wales sampling adequacy for Wales-only reporting; adjustments in CS2007 addressed this need.
  - Practical trade-offs: occasionally reduced sample counts in some classes (e.g., some English classes in CS2007) to maintain overall balance and reporting needs.

- National estimates: notes and guidance
  - Changing the basic classification used for national estimates impacts consistency; preferred approach is to use the latest classification for GB estimates when possible, while recognizing cross-survey comparability considerations.
  - Tables in the report illustrate how sample sizes and class definitions have varied across surveys, influencing national and country-level estimates.

- Enduring takeaway for data use
  - The Countryside Survey’s sampling strategy demonstrates a rigorous, evolution-driven approach to ecological monitoring, leveraging a stratified land-class framework to produce robust, country-specific habitat estimates and time-series data suitable for policy, planning, and public understanding.
