# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares, while all other CS data remain publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity; maintain scientific integrity and landowner goodwill.

## Data covered and governance
- Rolling program: 2018/2019–2024 funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.
- 2007 CS partners include NERC (via UKCEH), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.
- Confidentiality protects representativeness of sampling and landowner goodwill; essential for future survey permissions and environmental policy relevance.

## When locations may be released
- Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to indicate which 10 km x 10 km grid square contains a CS survey square.
- Six-digit grid references: released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, typically requiring UKCEH to perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing precise locations; external release requires demonstration that the external data/IP protection is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit locations.
- Conditions for release apply equally to spatial data and four-digit references.

## License terms and obligations
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- Upon license expiry, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- Data must not be shared with third parties in ways that could compromise square confidentiality; users must not infer precise square locations.
- If needed, licensees may be required to show evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases but still prohibit locating the exact squares from the data.

## Roles and processes
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Decisions and rationales are documented; annual reports summarise licence applications and outcomes for CS partners.
- Internal pre-processing support by UKCEH is encouraged to expedite approved uses, subject to moderate demand; requests by non-CS partners are case-by-case.
- Partners advised to consult UKCEH before committing to CS location data use to help define requirements and determine appropriate use; collaboration or paid support may be negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for potential users
- Consult UKCEH early to define requirements and determine whether pre-processing can meet needs without releasing precise locations.
- Expect licensing terms to require secure handling, restricted access, and destruction after project completion.
- Be prepared to demonstrate equivalent IP confidentiality protection if seeking six-digit or sensitive spatial data.
- Licensees should not use data to plan visits, monitor landowner compliance, or attempt to derive exact square locations.

## Contact and oversight
- UKCEH administers licences and, with NERC, oversees exceptional-release decisions.
- An annual report from UKCEH provides licence activity details and decision grounds.
- For internal CS-partner use, reasonable pre-processing support may be provided; broader third-party requests are evaluated case-by-case.
