# Introduction

- Purpose: This dataset provides monthly global methane emissions from natural wetlands at 0.5° x 0.5° resolution, generated by the JULES land surface model driven with WFDEI data. It is designed to support monitoring, evaluation, and policy-informed decision-making regarding environmental health and climate feedbacks.
- Key outputs: 
  - fwetl: Fraction of wetland in each grid box.
  - fch4_wetl: Gridbox methane flux from natural wetland (mg CH4 m-2 day-1), scaled so global wetlands emissions total 180 Tg CH4 per year.
  - cs: Gridbox soil carbon in each pool (decomposable plant material, resistant plant material, microbial biomass and humus).
  - t_soil: Gridbox sub-surface temperature of the top soil layer.
- Model and emission scheme: Uses JULES v4.5 with TRIFFID dynamic vegetation (competition disabled) to simulate energy, water, and carbon fluxes; methane emissions follow the Gedney et al. (2004) scheme with a temperature-dependent Q10 function and the sum of soil pool contributions weighted by pool-specific respiration factors.
- Output and interpretability: The dataset includes all variables from the methane emission equation so users can disentangle outputs or apply their own field data (e.g., dividing fch4_wetl by fwetl and multiplying by a user-provided wetland map).
- Calibration and scaling: Global wetland methane emissions are calibrated to 180 Tg CH4 per year in 2000 via the scaling constant k and the fwetl and pool parameters.
- Input data and drivers: 
  - Meteorology: WFDEI (WATCH Forcing Data applied to ERA-Interim).
  - Soil and hydrology: Harmonised World Soil Database; TOPMODEL-based hydrology with HydroSHEDS-derived topographic index; vegetation map from IGBP land cover data.
- File format and structure: Data distributed as CF-compliant netCDF files, with yearly files containing all variables.
- References and model context: Documentation and model descriptions are linked to key publications (Best et al., Clark et al., Gedney et al., IGBP, Marthews et al., Parker et al., McNorton et al., Weedon et al.).
