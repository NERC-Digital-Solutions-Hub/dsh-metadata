# Introduction

- Dataset purpose: monthly global methane emissions from natural wetlands at 0.5° x 0.5° resolution, derived from the JULES land surface model driven by WFDEI data.
- Spatial/temporal coverage: global, monthly emissions, stored in yearly netCDF files.
- Key output variables:
  - fwetl (1): fraction of wetland in each grid box.
  - fch4_wetl (mg CH4 m-2 day-1): gridbox methane flux from natural wetland, scaled so global wetlands emissions total 180 Tg CH4.
  - cs (kg m-2): soil carbon in decomposable plant material, resistant plant material, microbial biomass and humus.
  - t_soil (K): sub-surface temperature of the top soil layer.
- Modeling framework:
  - JULES (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) v4.5 with TRIFFID vegetation model (competition disabled) for vegetation growth; vegetation fractional cover prescribed from IGBP data.
  - Methane emission scheme uses a dynamic soil carbon pool approach with TOPMODEL-based hydrology.
  - Emission formula: fch4_wetl = k * fwetl * Q10(t_soil1m)^(t_soil1m/T0) * sum_i (κ_i * cs_i) with i representing soil pools (DPM, RPM, BIO, HUM) and specified κ values.
  - Global scaling factor k chosen so that global methane emissions equal 180 Tg/year (2000 baseline).
- Input data sources:
  - Meteorology: WFDEI (WATCH Forcing Data for ERA-Interim).
  - Soil properties: Harmonised World Soil Database (HWSD).
  - Topography/topographic index: HydroSHEDS-based data.
  - Vegetation: IGBP land cover map, regridded.
- File format and organization:
  - NetCDF format, CF-compliant, CEH gridded dataset conventions.
  - Data stored in yearly files with all variables included in each file.
- How to use in GIS:
  - The dataset’s decomposed terms (e.g., fwetl vs fch4_wetl) enable users to apply their own wetland maps or adjust inputs.
  - Example workflow: divide fch4_wetl by fwetl to map flux per unit wetland area, then multiply by a user-provided wetland dataset.
- Practical considerations for GIS work:
  - Global gridded, model-based product suitable for map-based visualizations and spatial analyses.
  - Allows disaggregation or re-aggregation with other geospatial layers and datasets.
