# Introduction

- Dataset provides monthly global methane emissions from natural wetlands at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution.
- Model origin: JULES land surface model driven with WFDEI meteorological forcing.
- Key output variables:
  - fwetl (1): Fraction of wetland in each grid cell.
  - fch4_wetl (mg CH4 m-2 day-1): Gridbox methane flux from natural wetlands, scaled so total global wetlands emissions are 180 Tg CH4.
  - cs (kg m-2): Soil carbon in each pool (decomposable plant material, resistant plant material, microbial biomass and humus).
  - t_soil (K): Sub-surface temperature of the top soil layer.
- Methane emission scheme (per Gedney et al. 2004) uses dynamic soil carbon and includes:
  - fch4_wetl = k × fwetl × Q10(t_soil1m)^(t_soil1m / T0) × Σi (κi × csi)
  - Pool-specific κ values: DPM, RPM, BIO, HUM with specified constants.
  - Q10 temperature dependence with T0 = 273.15 K; k = 7.034×10^-10; global emissions set to 180 Tg CH4 in 2000.
  - fwetl calculated using TOPMODEL hydrology within JULES.
  - All model variables in the dataset allow users to disentangle and re-apply the emission calculation.
- Model and vegetation details:
  - JULES version 4.5 with dynamic vegetation (TRIFFID) but competition disabled; vegetation cover prescribed from the IGBP database.
  - Uses Van Genuchten soil properties; TOPMODEL-based hydrology.
- Input data sources:
  - Meteorology: WFDEI (Watch Forcing Data for ERA-Interim).
  - Hydrological and thermal soil properties: Harmonised World Soil Database (FAO, 1995), regridded with CAP software.
  - Topography: HydroSHEDS-based topographic index (Marthews et al. 2015).
  - Vegetation map: IGBP land cover map (regridded with CAP).
- File format and structure:
  - NetCDF format, CF-compliant, CEH gridded dataset conventions.
  - Yearly files with all variables stored in a single file.
- Practical use and re-use:
  - The dataset exposes all components of the methane emission equation, enabling users to substitute in their own wetland maps (e.g., if using an observed wetland area map, divide fch4_wetl by fwetl and multiply by the observed wetlands dataset).
