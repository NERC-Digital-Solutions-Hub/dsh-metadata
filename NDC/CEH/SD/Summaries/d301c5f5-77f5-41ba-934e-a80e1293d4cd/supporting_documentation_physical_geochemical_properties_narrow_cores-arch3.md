# Physical and geochemical properties of saltmarsh soils produced from 462 narrow diameter gouge cores spanning 22 UK saltmarshes collected between 2018-2021

- Overview and purpose
  - Project: Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE); UK-wide assessment of saltmarsh soil properties to inform organic carbon stock calculations.
  - Objective: Provide physical and geochemical measurements to support estimation of organic carbon stocks across UK saltmarsh ecosystems.

- Data scope and coverage
  - 462 narrow-diameter gouge cores (30 mm) collected from 22 UK saltmarshes between 2018 and 2021.
  - Sub-sampling: 3434 sub-samples taken from cores at 10 cm intervals in the field.
  - Sites chosen to represent UK saltmarshs across varying sediment types and organic carbon contents.

- Sampling and measurement methods
  - Core collection: 30 mm gouge corer; DGPS used to record site locations.
  - Sample handling: cores frozen at -20°C until analysis.
  - Sub-sampling and description: field subsamples described using Troels-Smith classification; mid-point depths recorded.
  - Laboratory analyses:
    - Wet and dry bulk densities (g cm-3) determined from weighed samples before/after drying.
    - Organic carbon content (% wt) quantified using a Soli TOC with the temperature gradient method (DIN 19539; Natali et al. 2020; Smeaton et al. 2021).
    - Calibration: Soli TOC calibrated with CaCO3 and standard TOC/ROC/TIC references.
  - Quality control: laboratory equipment calibrated according to University of St Andrews practices.

- Location and temporal details
  - Geographic extent: United Kingdom (multisite coverage across Scotland, England, Wales) with site locations provided in both geographic (lat/long, WGS84) and projected coordinates.
  - Temporal coverage: samples collected 2018–2021; dataset describes year of collection for each entry.

- Metadata, provenance, and governance
  - Rich metadata structure includes variable descriptions, units, and data formats.
  - Data provenance established via collaboration among multiple UK universities and partners; responsible project personnel and affiliations listed.
  - Data sharing and openness: CSV format and comprehensive description facilitate reuse; explicit statements on calibration and QA practices; however, explicit public data access status is not stated in the description.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides standardized, field-based measurements of soil physical properties and soil organic carbon across a representative set of UK saltmarshes.
  - Enables estimation of regional carbon stocks and monitoring of changes over time when repeated or integrated with other sites.
  - Methodological rigor (Troels-Smith substrate classification, TOC analysis with calibration standards, DGPS positioning, QA procedures) supports comparability and transparency in policy-relevant monitoring.
