# Physical and geochemical properties of saltmarsh soils produced from 462 narrow diameter gouge cores spanning 22 UK saltmarshes collected between 2018-2021

## Overview
- A multi-site UK dataset describing physical and geochemical properties of saltmarsh soils.
- Based on 462 narrow-diameter gouge cores (30 mm) collected from 22 saltmarshes between 2018 and 2021.
- Aimed at enabling calculation of organic carbon soil stocks across UK saltmarsh ecosystems.

## Project, funding, and team
- Project: Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE).
- Funding: Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), NE/R010846/1.
- Staff responsible: Craig Smeaton.
- Research team includes researchers from University of St Andrews, University of Glasgow, University of York, University of Leeds, Bangor University, and UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, among others.

## Data collected and study design
- Sampling design: 462 cores collected from 22 UK saltmarshes; sub-samples (n=3434) retrieved from cores at 10 cm resolution in the field.
- Core collection: 30 mm gouge corers; samples collected and cores described using Troels-Smith classification; DGPS used for site locations.
- Sample handling: Samples frozen at -20°C until analysis; dry weights measured after drying at 60°C for 72 hours.
- Analysis: Carbon quantification using Elementar Soli TOC with a temperature gradient method (DIN 19539; Natali et al., 2020; Smeaton et al., 2021); calibration with CaCO3 and standards.
- Scope: Sea marsh soils used to quantify organic carbon content and related soil properties across multiple UK sites.

## Variables and data structure
- Data resource: Physical_geochemical_properties_narrow_cores.csv (data resource description available).
- Core-level and location fields:
  - Core_ID; Saltmarsh; Marsh_type (e.g., Natural, Realigned); Marsh_zone (Low, High); Nation (Scotland, Wales, England).
  - Collection_year; Lat_dec_deg (decimal degrees, WGS84); Long_dec_deg (decimal degrees, WGS84).
  - X_easting; Y_northing (location in projected coordinates).
  - Elevation_above_OD_m (elevation above ordnance datum).
  - Sample_depth_cm; Mid_Point_depth_cm (depth intervals in cm).
  - Substrate (Troels-Smith classification).
  - Wet_bulk_density_g_cm3; Dry_bulk_density_g_cm3.
  - OC_perc (organic carbon content, % by weight).
- File format: .csv; header definitions distinguish Description and Cell Format.
- Data conventions: NA indicates no data in cells; coordinates provided in both geographic (lat/long) and projected (X/Y) formats.

## Methods and quality control
- Field methods: 462 cores collected with 30 mm gouge, sub-samples at 10 cm increments, DGPS location data.
- Laboratory methods: Drying, milling, and TOC analysis per DIN 19539; calibration with CaCO3 and standard references; equipment calibration per institutional practice (University of St Andrews).
- Quality control notes: Laboratory equipment calibrated according to local practices; samples stored and analyzed under specified conditions; description fields outline procedures and formats.

## Data governance, provenance, and documentation
- Data provenance: Generated by a multi-institution collaboration under the C-SIDE project; core and sub-sample data linked to specific saltmarsh locations across the UK.
- Metadata and structure: Comprehensive metadata in the data resource description; clear column headers and formats to support interoperability and reuse.
- Documentation scope: Includes method references, calibration details, and data field definitions to facilitate reproducibility and secondary analysis.

## Usage, limitations, and dissemination
- Intended use: Calculation of UK saltmarsh organic carbon soil stocks; cross-site comparisons; integration into ecosystem carbon accounting.
- Reuse considerations: Ensure alignment of coordinate systems (WGS84 for lat/long; projected coordinates for X/Y), unit consistency (g cm-3 for densities, OC% for carbon content), and adherence to Troels-Smith substrate classifications for comparability.
- Updates and maintenance: Not explicitly stated; data reflect collection period 2018–2021; potential for future updates if additional samples are acquired.
