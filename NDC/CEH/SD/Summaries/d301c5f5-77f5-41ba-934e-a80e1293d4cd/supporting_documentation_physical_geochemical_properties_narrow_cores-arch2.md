# Physical and geochemical properties of saltmarsh soils produced from 462 narrow diameter gouge cores spanning 22 UK saltmarshes collected between 2018-2021

- Aim and scope
  - Provides physical and geochemical measurements of saltmarsh soils to calculate organic carbon soil stocks across UK saltmarsh ecosystems.
  - Data intended to support standardized monitoring and comparison of carbon storage in intertidal environments.

- Data collection and sampling
  - 462 narrow sediment cores collected from 22 UK saltmarshes using a 30 mm gouge corer.
  - Sub-samples (n=3434) taken at 10 cm increments in the field.
  - Core descriptions follow Troels-Smith classification.
  - DGPS used to record sample-site locations; samples frozen at -20°C until analysis.
  - Samples dried at 60°C for 72 hours to determine bulk densities; milled to fine powder for analysis.

- Location and coverage
  - United Kingdom with sites across Scotland, Wales, and England; field locations chosen to represent saltmarsh types, sediments, and organic carbon content.
  - Observations geolocated in decimal degrees (WGS84) with associated easting/northing coordinates and elevation above ordnance datum (m).

- Variables and measurements
  - Elevation above ordnance datum (m)
  - Substrate (Troels-Smith classification)
  - Wet bulk density (g cm^-3)
  - Dry bulk density (g cm^-3)
  - Organic carbon content (% by weight)

- Laboratory methods and calibration
  - Carbon quantification via Soli TOC with a temperature gradient method (DIN 19539); standards include CaCO3 and Silty soil TOC/ROC/TIC.
  - Calibration and quality checks performed with appropriate standards; laboratory equipment calibrated per University of St Andrews practices.

- Data processing and format
  - Data stored as CSV files (Physical_geochemical_properties_narrow_cores.csv and related resources).
  - Key fields include Core_ID, Saltmarsh, Marsh_type, Marsh_zone (Low/High), Nation (Scotland/Wales/England), Collection_year, Lat/Long, X_Easting, Y_Northing, Elevation, Sample_depth_cm, Mid_Point_depth_cm, Substrate, Wet_bulk_density_g_cm3, Dry_bulk_density_g_cm3, OC_perc.

- Data quality and stewardship
  - Observational data collected with standardized field procedures; QC through lab calibration and documented methods.
  - Data intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for accessibility and reuse.

- Relevance for monitoring and policy
  - Enables UK-wide assessment of organic carbon stocks in saltmarsh soils, supporting long-term environmental monitoring and evaluation of carbon storage in intertidal ecosystems.
  - Facilitates data sharing and integration with other environmental datasets to enhance the value of monitoring datasets.
