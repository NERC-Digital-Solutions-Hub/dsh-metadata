# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), with gratitude to volunteers.
- It provides annual data on butterfly population status across the UK from a large-scale, site-based monitoring program.
- Since 1976, UKBMS has monitored butterfly abundance across more than 2,500 active sites each year, using multiple sampling methods analyzed together to answer biodiversity status and policy questions.

## Data Collection Methods

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km), recording all species in a 5 m wide belt weekly from April to September (up to ~26 counts/year) across ~2,000 sites.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum 2 visits in July/August); ~800 squares/year.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focused on particular species.

## Data Processing & Analysis

- Data are converted into abundance indices (relative measures, not absolute counts) to reflect population trends.
- Site-level indices are combined into species-level collated indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with a weighting adjustment so that site data weighted by the proportion of the species flight period surveyed influence the final index more strongly.
- The seasonal pattern across a year is estimated from all counts and used to extrapolate for gaps; weighting emphasizes observed data over extrapolated data.

## Quality Control

- Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods); records can be corrected or adjusted.
- Regional transect coordinators review data for questionable entries; continued validation occurs throughout the season with automated and manual checks, including cross-checks against known distributions and flight periods.
- Corrections are implemented through queries and coordinated discussions with coordinators or recorders.

## Data Download Details

- The download provides annual collated indices of abundance for all species with sufficient data from 1976–2021 (some early years may be missing due to data limitations).
- Data format: CSV with columns including SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (log10, scaled so the series average equals 2), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
- The Collated Index is presented as log10 values and is standardized for relative comparison over time.
