# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview and purpose
- Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Relies on volunteer contributions; aims to provide annual data on butterfly population status.
- Data supports understanding biodiversity changes and informs policy questions related to status and trends.

## Sampling framework
- Three complementary components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km), weekly counts up to 26 times/year, 5 m wide, across ~2000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects per square, 2–3 visits/year (minimum 2 in July/August; spring visits encouraged), ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods like timed counts, egg/larval web counts.
- All data streams are analyzed together to produce overall indicators.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices reflect a consistent proportion of butterflies present; detectability varies by species.
- Collated species indices produced with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year to emphasize observed data over extrapolated data.
- Combines counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS to estimate seasonal patterns and fill data gaps.

## Quality control
- Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online (UKBMS data entry site) or via Transect Walker.
- Automated checks flag potential errors; regional transect coordinators validate records throughout the season.
- Additional validation checks include: records outside known distributions, outside flight periods, first-time site records, extreme or anomalous abundances.
- Corrections are made through queries and coordination with recorders as needed.

## Details of this data download
- Provides annual collated indices of abundance for species with sufficient data from 1976–2021 (some early years not calculated due to data limitations).
- Data distributed as CSV (.csv).
- Key columns: SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (log10, scaled so average equals 2), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
- Taxonomic references and checklists cited for species naming.

## Licence and attribution
- Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use and reuse with few conditions.
- Must include citation with DOI in publications describing research using the data.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks and policy planning
- Demonstrates a multi-method, long-term monitoring framework that blends transects, stratified sampling, and targeted surveys.
- Emphasizes quality assurance, data governance, and transparent methodology for policy-relevant indicators.
- Highlights practical data sharing considerations, metadata clarity, and collaboration to improve environmental health assessments and decision-making.
