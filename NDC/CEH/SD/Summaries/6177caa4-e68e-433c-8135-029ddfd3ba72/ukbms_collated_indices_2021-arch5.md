# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with thanks to volunteers.
- Purpose: annual data on butterfly population status from a wide-scale, site-based monitoring program; informs policy questions on biodiversity status and trends.
- History and scope: monitoring since 1976 with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year; data from all sampling methods are analyzed together.
- Data use: provides abundance indices (relative measures) to track population changes and trends across the UK.

- Sampling framework (data collection methods):
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km, weekly counts (April–September), 26 counts/year, 5 m recording band, ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year (minimum two in July/August), ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts).

- Nature of data and trend analysis:
  - Use abundance indices (relative population size) derived from counts; site indices reflect comparable portions of populations.
  - Collated species indices produced with Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with site-year weighting based on the species’ flight period.
  - All seasonal counts are used to estimate patterns and fill gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

- Quality control (QA/QC):
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; online entry via UKBMS data site or Transect Walker.
  - Automated checks detect anomalies; regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
  - Further automated/manual validation checks for out-of-range, out-of-distribution records, first-time site records, or unusual abundances.
  - Corrections are made through queries and edits to the main UKBMS dataset as needed.

- Details of this data download:
  - Annual collated indices for species with sufficient data, 1976–2021 (earlier years may be incomplete).
  - File format: CSV.
  - Key columns: SPECIES CODE, SPECIES (scientific name), COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (log10, scaled so average = 2), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
  - Notes on taxonomy references and data coverage; some years lack collated indices due to insufficient data.
