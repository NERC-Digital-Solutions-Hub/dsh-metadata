# Sampling regime

- Study period and scope
  - River Tay and its tributaries sampled monthly for chemical analysis and greenhouse gas concentrations at nine sites.
  - Sampling duration: February 2009 to December 2010.
  - Site locations chosen based on existing SEPA flow gauging and water sampling sites.

- Sample collection methods
  - Headspace technique used to determine dissolved CH4, CO2, and N2O concentrations.
  - For each sample: three 60 mL syringes used to extract 40 mL of river water from 10 cm below the surface; 20 mL ambient air added.
  - Syringes shaken vigorously underwater for 1 minute to equilibrate headspace and water.
  - Headspace gas injected into pre-evacuated 12 mL gas-tight vials for later GC analysis.
  - An ambient atmosphere sample collected as a reference.
  - Water temperature and atmospheric pressure recorded.
  - On-site water sampling: Hydrolab Quanta Probe used to measure temperature.
  - A 1 L bottle of main stream water collected from the river edge, then filtered on-site through pre-combusted GF/F (0.7 µm, 47 mm) paper using a filtration unit and electric vacuum pump.
  - Filtered sub-samples stored at 5 °C until analysis.

- Analytical methods
  - Gases
    - CH4 and N2O measured with HP5890 Series II GC equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD) and a flame ionisation detector (FID); accuracy ~30 ppb for N2O and ~70 ppb for CH4.
    - CO2 measured on a separate HP5890 Series II GC.
    - Dissolved concentrations calculated from headspace measurements using:
      - CH4: Wiesenburg and Guinasso (1979) Bunsen solubility data.
      - CO2 and N2O: Weiss and Price (1980) solubility data.
    - Gas-saturation values calculated as the ratio of dissolved gas concentration to the expected equilibrium water concentration.
  - Dissolved inorganic and organic carbon
    - DOC and TDC measured with a PPM LABTOC analyser using ultraviolet oxidation and infrared gas analysis.
    - DIC calculated as the difference between TDC and DOC.
    - Instrument accuracy ≈ 1% of the calibration standard concentration.
  - Nutrients and nitrogen species
    - Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), NO3-, and NH4+ analyzed on a Skalar San Plus automated flow analyser using standard colorimetric methods.
    - NO3- determined via copper/cadmium reduction and sulphanilamide/NEDD reaction to form a red/purple color (absorbance at 540 nm).
    - TDN via oxidation/digestion by persulfate/UV digestion.
    - NH4+ via hypochlorite reaction forming chloroamine, then reacting with nitroprusside and salicylate to form an indophenol dye (absorbance at 640 nm).
