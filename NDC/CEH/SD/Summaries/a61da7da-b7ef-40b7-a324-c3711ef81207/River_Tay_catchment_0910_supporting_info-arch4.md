# Sampling regime

- Scope and design: Water from the River Tay and its tributaries was sampled monthly from February 2009 to December 2010 at nine sites, chosen based on existing SEPA flow gauging and sampling locations.

- Sampling method for gases: Headspace technique to determine dissolved CH4, CO2, and N2O. For each sample:
  - Three 60 mL syringes collected 40 mL of river water from 10 cm below the surface, then 20 mL ambient air was added.
  - Syringes shaken underwater for 1 minute to equilibrate headspace with water temperature.
  - Headspace gas injected into pre-evacuated 12 mL gas-tight vials for GC analysis.
  - An ambient atmosphere sample was taken; water temperature and atmospheric pressure recorded.
  - Gas concentrations reported as triplicate means.

- On-site water sampling and handling: 
  - Temperature measured with a Hydrolab Quanta Probe.
  - 1 L plastic bottle used to sample the main water stream from the river edge.
  - On-site filtration through pre-combusted GF/F filters (0.7 μm) using a filtration unit; filtrates stored at 5 °C until analysis.

- Analytical methods for dissolved gases: 
  - CH4 and N2O measured with an HP5890 II GC equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD) and flame ionisation detector (FID).
  - CO2 measured on a separate HP5890 II GC.
  - Dissolved gas concentrations calculated from headspace measurements using Bunsen solubility (CH4) and Weiss & Price solubility (CO2 and N2O).
  - Gas saturation values calculated as the ratio of dissolved gas concentration to the equilibrium concentration in water.

- Additional chemical analyses:
  - DOC and TDC via PPM LABTOC analyser using ultraviolet oxidation and infrared detection; DIC derived from the difference between TDC and DOC; instrument accuracy ~1% of calibration standard concentration.
  - Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), NO3-, and NH4+ measured with a Skalar San Plus automated analyzer using standard colorimetric methods:
    - NO3- reduction via copper/cadmium and sulphanilamide/NEDD reaction to form a red/purple colour (absorbance at 540 nm).
    - TDN oxidation/digestion by persulfate/UV.
    - NH4+ via hypochlorite reaction forming chloroamine, then indophenol dye (absorbance at 640 nm).

- Data units and formatting:
  - Missing data indicated with an asterisk in the CSV file.
  - All data reported to two decimal places.
  - Units and data columns detailed in Table 1, including: Temperature (°C); N2O-N (μg/L); CH4-C (μg/L); CO2-C (mg/L); NO3-N (mg/L); NH4-N (mg/L); TDN-N (mg/L); DON-N (mg/L); DOC (mg/L); TDC (mg/L); DIC (mg/L); CO2 Sat (%); CH4 Sat (%); N2O Sat (%).
