# Sampling regime

- Study design and scope
  - Water from the River Tay and its tributaries sampling conducted monthly for chemical analysis and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations.
  - Sampling period: February 2009 to December 2010.
  - Nine sites chosen based on existing SEPA flow gauging and water sampling sites.

- Sample collection procedures
  - Headspace technique used to determine dissolved CH4, CO2, and N2O concentrations.
  - For each sample: three 60 mL syringes extract 40 mL of river water from 10 cm below the surface; 20 mL ambient air added; syringes shaken underwater for 1 minute to equilibrate headspace with water temperature.
  - Headspace gas injected into pre-evacuated 12 mL gas-tight vials; ambient atmosphere sample also taken.
  - On-site measurements: water temperature (Hydrolab Quanta Probe) and atmospheric pressure recorded.
  - Water samples for dissolved constituents collected in 1 L bottles, filtered on site through pre-combusted GF/F filters (0.7 µm, 47 mm) using a filtration unit, then stored at 5 °C until analysis.

- Analytical methods
  - GHG analysis: N2O and CH4 measured on a HP5890 Series II GC with an electron capture detector (ECD) and flame ionisation detector (FID); CH4 accuracy ~70 ppb, N2O ~30 ppb. CO2 measured on a second HP5890 GC.
  - Calculations: dissolved gas concentrations derived from headspace measurements using Bunsen solubility (CH4; Wiesenburg & Guinasso, 1979) and CO2/N2O solubility (Weiss & Price, 1980).
  - Saturation values: ratio of dissolved gas concentration to the expected equilibrium water concentration.
  - DOC and TDC: measured with a PPM LABTOC analyzer using ultraviolet oxidation and infrared gas analysis; DIC calculated as TDC – DOC. Instrument accuracy ≈ 1% of the calibration standard.
  - TDN, NO3-, NH4+: analyzed by a Skalar San plus automated flow analyzer using standard colorimetric methods.
    - NO3-: copper/cadmium reduction and sulphanilamide/NEDD reaction; absorbance at 540 nm.
    - TDN: oxidation/digestion by peroxodisulfate/UV digestion.
    - NH4+: hypochlorite reaction to form chloroamine, then nitroprusside/salicylate dye; absorbance at 640 nm.
