# Sampling regime

- Water from the River Tay and its tributaries was sampled monthly for chemical analysis and determination of greenhouse gas concentrations at nine sites between February 2009 and December 2010. Site locations were based on existing SEPA flow gauging and water sampling sites.

## Sampling design and site context
- Nine sampling sites derived from the SEPA network; sampling occurred monthly over nearly two years (Feb 2009–Dec 2010).
- Data collected to assess concentrations of dissolved gases (CH4, CO2, N2O) and related water chemistry parameters.

## Sample collection methods
- Headspace technique used to determine dissolved CH4, CO2, and N2O. For each sample:
  - Three 60 ml syringes collected ~40 ml river water each from 10 cm below the surface; 20 ml ambient air added.
  - Syringes shaken underwater for 1 min to equilibrate headspace with water; headspace gas injected into pre-evacuated 12 ml gas-tight vials.
  - An ambient atmosphere sample collected; water temperature and atmospheric pressure recorded.
- On-site water sampling and filtering:
  - Hydrolab Quanta Probe used for water temperature.
  - 1 L bottle used to collect main water stream sample from the river edge.
  - On-site filtration through pre-combusted (500°C, 10 h) Whatman GF/F 0.7 µm, 47 mm filter paper; filtration with Nalgene unit and electric vacuum pump.
  - Filtered sub-samples stored at 5 °C until analysis.

## Analytical methods
- GHG analysis:
  - CH4 and N2O measured on an HP 5890 Series II GC with an electron capture detector (ECD) and flame ionisation detector (FID); CH4 accuracy ≈ 70 ppb, N2O ≈ 30 ppb.
  - CO2 measured on a second HP 5890 Series II GC.
  - Dissolved gas concentrations calculated from headspace measurements using Bunsen solubility relationships: CH4 from Wiesenburg and Guinasso (1979); CO2 and N2O from Weiss and Price (1980).
  - Gas saturation values computed as the ratio of dissolved concentrations to equilibrium water concentrations.
- Organic and inorganic carbon:
  - DOC and TDC measured with a PPM LABTOC analyser using ultraviolet oxidation and infrared gas analysis.
  - DIC calculated as difference between TDC and DOC.
  - Instrument accuracy ≈ 1% of the calibration standard.
- Nutrients and nitrogen species:
  - TDN, NO3-, and NH4+ measured simultaneously with a Skalar San Plus automated analyzer using standard colorimetric methods.
  - NO3- determined by copper/cadmium reduction and sulphanilamide/NEDD reaction (absorbance at 540 nm).
  - TDN via oxidation/digestion by peroxodisulfate/UV digestion.
  - NH4+ via hypochlorite reaction forming chloroamine, then nitroprusside/salicylate to form an pink/diole dye (absorbance at 640 nm).
