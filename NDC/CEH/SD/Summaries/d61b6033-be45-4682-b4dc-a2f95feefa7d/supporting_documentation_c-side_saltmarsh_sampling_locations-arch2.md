# Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE)

- Project and team
  - Project: Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE)
  - Funded by: NERC (NE/R010846/1)
  - Staff responsible: Craig Smeaton
  - Research team includes collaborators from University of St Andrews, University of Glasgow, University of York, University of Leeds, Bangor University, UK CEH, and others

- Dataset overview
  - Focus: Global positioning system (GPS) locations and elevations of soil sampling sites across UK saltmarshes
  - Timeframe: 2018–2021
  - Sites: 1,323 sampling sites across UK saltmarshes
  - Geography: United Kingdom (emphasis on Scotland for comparability; includes Scotland, England, and Wales)
  - Primary purpose: Surficial organic carbon (OC) stock calculations, soil carbon stocks and burial rates, and assessment of belowground biomass

- Geospatial and site metadata
  - Locations: GPS coordinates provided as decimal degrees (WGS84) and as X (Easting) and Y (Northing); elevation above Ordnance Datum (m)
  - Extent descriptors: UK wide with a focus on similar environmental regions in Scotland to enable comparability
  - Site identifiers: Marsh_ID (saltmarsh name), Site_ID (sample identifier)
  - Administrative and context fields: Nation, Local_authority
  - Marsh characteristics: Marsh_type (Natural, Historic Breach, Managed Realignment)
  - Collection year: Year of sampling

- Variables and data formats
  - Spatial variables: Lat_dec_deg, Long_dec_deg, X_easting, Y_northing, Elevation_AOD_m
  - Sampling and core data: Sampling_method (Syringe Sampler; Narrow (30 mm) gouge corer; Wide (60 mm) gouge corer), Core_length_cm
  - Purpose-related variables: Purpose (Surficial OC stock calculations; Soil C stocks and burial rates; Belowground biomass)
  - Data format: .csv
  - Documentation: Locations described with decimal degrees and projected coordinates; data recorded on GPS devices at saltmarsh sites

- Data collection and processing
  - Equipment and corrections: Juniper Systems RTK corrections in real time, Leica Infinity real-time corrections, Trimble GNSS correction service
  - Calibration and processing: No subsequent processing documented
  - Data quality: Data checking procedures (quality control) not provided (NA)

- Data management and accessibility
  - Data resource identifiers: GPS locations and elevations as the described dataset; detailed variable and site metadata provided
  - Data storage and sharing: Intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals (specific portals not listed)

- Use cases and implications for monitoring
  - Supports standardized, repeatable assessment of saltmarsh carbon stocks and burial rates over time
  - Enables integration with other datasets for broader environmental monitoring and policy performance evaluation
  - Highlights the potential to increase data value through cross-dataset integration and improved access to underlying data

- Key challenges and opportunities for analysts
  - Challenge: Increasing the value of the dataset by combining with other relevant data sources
  - Challenge: Enabling broader access to the underlying data used to generate outputs
  - Opportunity: Standardized geospatial and sediment data support consistent environmental health monitoring and policy assessment across the UK saltmarsh ecosystem
