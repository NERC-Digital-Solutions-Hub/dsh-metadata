# Overview of data

## Study purpose and scope
- Compilation of results from the in-stream N-cycling component of the NERC Macronutrients consortium, led by Prof. Mark Trimmer, titled "The role of lateral exchange in the seaward flux of C, N and P."
- Data generated by Dr. Katrina Lansdown under guidance of Prof. Trimmer and Dr. Kate Heppell.
- Two accompanying data files:
  - Lansdown et al N transformations and porewater chemistry in permeable sediments
  - Lansdown et al N transformations in clays
- Four field campaigns across rivers of varying land-river connectivity in the Hampshire Avon catchment to measure in situ rates of nitrogen transformations and porewater chemistry.

## Data collection and study design
- Permeable sediments (sand or chalk geology) studied with a push-pull technique using bespoke stainless steel probes at depths of 3–20 cm.
- Clays studied using intact-core method due to clogging and recovery issues with push-pull in fine sediments.
- In permeable sediments, porewater sampled for O2, pH, Fe(II), and nutrient/chloride analyses; 15N-labeled nitrate injected to measure nitrogen transformations.
- In clays, 15N-labeled nitrate added to overlying river water; cores incubated for up to 4 hours, then slurrified for analysis.
- Data files structure: 241 rows x 20 columns (permeable sediments) and 153 rows x 7 columns (clays).

## Sampling methods and measurements
- Field campaigns: spring, summer, autumn 2013, and winter 2014; some sites excluded due to flooding or owner constraints.
- Measurements and parameters collected:
  - In situ rates: A14 (anammox), D14 (denitrification), ra (anammox contribution to N2)
  - Nitrification indicators: Nit-15N (nitrification potential in permeable sediments) and Nit-pn (ambient nitrification in clays)
  - Chemical and physical porewater parameters: Ammonium, Chloride, Iron(II), Methane, Nitrate, Nitrite, N2O, O2, O2sat, pH, SRP
  - Metadata: Season, SiteCode, Vegetated (Y/N), Depth
- Analytical methods:
  - Ammonium by indophenol blue method; detection limit 0.6 μM
  - Chloride by ion-selective electrode; detection limit 1.9 mg/L
  - Fe(II) by phenanthroline colorimetric method; detection limit 1 μM
  - Methane/N2O/N2 analysis via gas chromatography with headspace methods; detection limits specified per compound
  - O2 measured with microelectrode; calibration with zero and known O2 solutions; contamination subtracted
  - SRP by molybdenum blue method; detection limit 0.1 μM
- Data conventions: BD L indicates below detection limit; ND indicates not determined due to conditions (e.g., flow).

## Data structure and key variables
- Column headers (examples of key fields):
  - RecordID (unique sample identifier)
  - Season
  - SiteCode (e.g., CE1, CW2, GN1, GA2, AS1, AS2)
  - Vegetated
  - Depth (cm)
  - A14 (in situ anammox rate)
  - D14 (in situ denitrification rate)
  - ra (anammox contribution to N2 production)
  - Nit-15N (nitrification potential in permeable sediments)
  - Nit-pn (ambient nitrification in clays)
  - Ammonium, Chloride, Iron(II), Methane, Nitrate, Nitrite, N2O, O2, O2sat, pH, SRP
- Units vary by parameter and by sediment type (permeable sediments vs clays), with standard calculation methods cited.

## N2 calculations and interpretation
- 15N-nitrate tracer mixes with ambient 14N; production of 29N2 and 30N2 measured via mass spectrometry after equilibrating with a helium headspace.
- For permeable sediments:
  - Rates P29 and P30 determined by linear trend of aN2 over time; corrections applied for advective flow via chloride decay.
  - Nitrification in permeable sediments quantified by production of 15N-NOx after converting nitrate to nitrite and then to N2.
  - p14 (14N-N2 production from ambient processes) calculated using r14 (14N:15N ratio), P29, P30 and nitrate ratios.
  - ra (fraction of N2 production from anammox) derived from 15N in N2 and N2O pools.
  - A14 (14N produced by anammox) and D14 (14N produced by denitrification) computed from p14 and ra.
- For impermeable sediments (clays):
  - Similar framework, but N2 data quantified from slurry measurements and scaled to m2 riverbed per hour.
  - Ambient nitrification rate Nit-pn calculated using p14, ra, and adjustments for the ambient nitrate pool.
- References to standard methods for calculations are provided (e.g., Nielsen 1992; Risgaard-Petersen et al. 2003; Trimmer et al. 2006).

## Data quality, limitations, and caveats
- Detection limits and measurement precision documented for all chemical analyses.
- Some measurements missing due to flow conditions or site flooding; porewater sampling constraints noted.
- Methodological differences between permeable sediments and clays require careful interpretation when comparing across sediment types.
