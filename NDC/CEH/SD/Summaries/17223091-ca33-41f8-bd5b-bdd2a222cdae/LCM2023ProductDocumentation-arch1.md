# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

- Purpose and scope
  - User guide for the UKCEH Land Cover Map 2023 (LCM2023), an annual product consisting of seven datasets: three for Great Britain (GB) and three for Northern Ireland (NI) plus a 1 km summary raster.
  - Datasets include 10 m classified pixels, 10 m land parcels (vector), 25 m rasterised land parcels, and a 1 km summary raster; appendix 3 lists official dataset names and DOIs.
  - Aims to describe data production, validation, and accuracy to enable informed use and decision-making.

- UKCEH Land Cover Classes and mapping framework
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats concepts) used to describe land cover.
  - Classes related to BAP Broad Habitats but not identical; distinctions are annotated and cross-referenced in appendices.
  - Seasonal and contextual information integrated to reduce spectral confusion and improve classification.

- Dataset descriptions (GB and NI; plus cross-GB/NI 1 km products)
  - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
    - Created by mosaicking multiple Classification Scenes; each pixel carries two bands: the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class and the associated classification probability (confidence).
    - 10 m pixels are not generalised by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine features.
  - Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
    - Generated by intersecting 10 m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
    - Rasterised version of land parcels; carries per-parcel mode, conf (mean probability) and purity as three bands.
  - Vector Land Parcels
    - Land parcel geometries provided within the UKCEH Spatial Framework; intended for change detection and parcel-based analyses.
  - 1 km summary rasters (GB and NI)
    - Summary of 25 m data to 1 km resolution: dominant class, dominant aggregate class, and percentage cover per class and per aggregate class (with rounding caveats near boundaries).
    - Coefficients acknowledge that sums may not equal exactly 100% due to rounding and coastal partial coverage.
  - Classification Scenes and classification approach
    - GB: 32 Classification Scenes following a tile grid (~100 x 100 km); NI: single Classification Scene covering NI.
    - Scenes combine Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images (10 bands at 10 m for many bands) with Context Rasters to form Classification Scenes.
  - Seasonal Composite Images
    - Derived from Google Earth Engine; Sentinel-2 reflectance resampled to 10 m; four seasons (Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec) with 10 Sentinel-2 bands used; occasional gaps due to cloud.
  - Context Rasters
    - 10 m context layers to reduce spectral confusion (GB) including terrain (height, aspect, slope) and proximity masks to buildings, roads, tidal water, freshwater, foreshore, woodland, saltmarsh.
    - NI context rasters include urban mask and proximity to coast, freshwater, roads, foreshore, tidal water.
  - Data processing and scale considerations
    - GB tiles support regional phenological variation; NI processed in a single scene; 10 m data emphasize detailed features, while 25 m/parcels provide a stable framework for comparison and change detection.

- UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Framework inherited from LCM2007 and refined for LCM2015; used to generalise land cover into discrete parcels (~0.5 ha minimum) for stable change-detection units.
  - Parcel identifiers (gid) may not align with LCM2015 if cross-map comparisons are attempted; processing re-ordered storage and indices for performance.
  - Parcels typically dominated by a single land cover; infrastructure designed to facilitate time-series comparisons.

- Bootstrap Training and Random Forest classification
  - Bootstrap Training: automatic training data generation without new fieldwork; uses historic LCM observations (LCM2020–LCM2022) to sample current Sentinel-2 imagery; pixels with >80% probability and consistent class across three years are used for training.
  - Random Forest classifier: balanced training via sampling with replacement to ensure rare classes are adequately represented.
  - Production system includes bespoke UKCEH software integrating WEKA, PostGIS, and GDAL; open-source components.

- Validation and accuracy
  - Product validation uses 33,107 reference points spanning all 21 classes.
  - Overall accuracy for LCM2023: 83%.
  - Appendix 4 provides detailed confusion matrices, class-wise user/producer accuracies, and summary statistics.

- Known issues and caveats
  - Minor missing polygons in vector land parcel products; negligible effect on 1 km products; 10 m classified pixels datasets unaffected.
  - Some classification uncertainties exist due to spectral similarity between certain habitats (e.g., some bog, heath, and peat-related classes) and due to the inherent differences between BAP Broad Habitats and satellite-detected land cover classes.
  - Temporal changes vs. methodological changes: occasional differences across annual maps reflect both real change and updates to methods.

- Data access, citation, and documentation
  - Each LCM2023 dataset has a DOI; citations are provided in Table 5 (and corresponding dataset references).
  - Users are encouraged to cite the appropriate data product by DOI when using LCM2023 data.
  - Additional documentation includes overviews of production methods (see Marston et al., 2023; 2024 references) and detailed appendices describing class definitions and BAP crosswalks.
  - Appendix 5 and Appendix 6 provide recommended color recipes for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes (including color-blind-friendly options) and accompanying QGIS symbol files.
