# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

## Overview
- UKCEH LCM2023 is a land cover mapping product created annually, consisting of seven datasets: three for Great Britain (GB) and three for Northern Ireland (NI) plus a 1 km summary raster across GB and NI.
- Data are produced from Classification Scenes that combine Sentinel-2 seasonal composites with Context Rasters; classification is automatic using Bootstrap Training and Random Forest.
- The map provides 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes, aligned with Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats, plus aggregate classes in the Land Parcel product.
- Formal validation reports an overall accuracy of 83% at full thematic detail.
- The production aims to improve temporal consistency, comparability and change detection, with annual updates intended to differentiate real change from classification error.

## Data Products and Formats
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets
  - GB: 2 bands per pixel (class identifier and associated confidence/probability).
  - NI: 2 bands per pixel (class and confidence).
  - Pixels are not generalized to the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine, narrow features; validation is against the 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset.
- Land Parcel datasets
  - Generated by intersecting 10 m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to create parcel attributes.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Raster format with 3 bands per parcel: dominant land cover (_mode), confidence (_conf), and parcel purity (_purity).
- 1 km summary rasters
  - GB and NI combined; four products:
    - Dominant cover (class, 1 band)
    - Dominant cover (aggregate classes, 1 band)
    - Percentage cover for 21 classes (1 km, 21 bands)
    - Percentage cover for 10 aggregate classes (1 km, 10 bands)
  - Percentage totals are integer rounded; coastal areas may sum to less than 100 due to mapping extents.
- Context Rasters
  - Used to reduce spectral confusion; GB includes 10 context rasters (e.g., Height, Aspect, Slope, distances to buildings/roads/tidal water/freshwater, foreshore mask, woodland mask, saltmarsh mask).
  - NI includes 9 context rasters (Height, Aspect, Slope, urban mask, distances to coast/road/freshwater, foreshore mask, tidal water mask).
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Derived from Sentinel-2, resampled to 10 m; four seasons: Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec.
  - Uses bands 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8A,11,12; occasional gaps due to cloud are handled by the classifier.
- Classification Scenes
  - GB: 32 tiled Classification Scenes (~100 x 100 km tiles) for full GB coverage; some tiles enlarged to include sea-dominated areas (e.g., Western Isles, Orkney, Shetland, Cornwall/Scilly).
  - NI: Single Classification Scene covering the NI land mass.
  - Each Scene is trained and classified independently.
- Coordinate Systems
  - GB: British National Grid, EPSG 27700.
  - NI: Irish Grid (TM75), EPSG 29903.
- Pixel/Parcel Counts and Extents
  - GB and NI parcel counts provided in product tables; GB and NI extents align with national grids shown in the dataset details.

## Classification Method and Data Sources
- Bootstrap Training
  - Automatic training process that samples training observations from historic land maps without fresh field data.
  - Uses pixels from LCM2020, LCM2021, and LCM2022 with >80% class probability and consistent class across all three years.
  - Large Bootstrap Training sets help stabilize learning; changes are better detected over successive maps.
- Random Forest
  - RF classifier trained on Bootstrap Training pixels; 10,000 samples per class (with replacement) to ensure balanced learning.
  - Output per pixel: most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class and the associated confidence.
- Software and workflow
  - Bespoke UKCEH software integrating WEKA, PostGIS, and GDAL; uses open-source components.

## Spatial Framework and Parcel Data
- UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Used to generalise national cartography into discrete land parcels (≥ ~0.5 ha MMU).
  - Parcels are designed to represent real-world units (fields, parks, urban areas, etc.) and are typically dominated by a single land cover type.
  - 10 m Classified Pixel data are not automatically constrained to the Parcel framework to preserve fine detail; parcel-aggregated products (25 m rasters, land parcels) provide a cleaner basis for change detection.
- Parcel Identifiers
  - LCM2023 uses gid as a unique parcel identifier in vector products; changes in the spatial framework mean gid values may not match LCM2015 identifiers.

## Validation and Known Issues
- Validation
  - 33,107 validation reference points across the UK; covers all 21 classes.
  - Overall accuracy: 83% (full thematic detail).
- Known Issues
  - A small number of polygons are missing from the vector land parcel products, causing nodata in the 25 m rasterised parcels; impact is negligible for 1 km summary rasters; 10 m classified pixels are unaffected.

## How to Cite and Data Citations
- Each LCM2023 dataset has a DOI; recommended citations include Marston et al. (2024) for the 10 m classified pixels and related datasets, along with corresponding entries for NI, 25 m rasterised land parcels, land parcels (vector), and 1 km summary rasters.
