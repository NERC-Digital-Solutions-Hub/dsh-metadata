# U-GRASS (Understanding and enhancing soil ecosystem services and resilience in UK grass and croplands) Soil functional measurements (enzymatic activities) across geo linked sampling locations, on grassland, UK (2016)

## Executive overview
- Project purpose: measure soil enzymatic activities to understand soil functional change under different management and climatic scenarios; part of the NERC U-GRASS soil security programme.
- Scope: 32 grassland sites across the UK with land-use contrasts (intensive vs extensive) sampled in winter/spring 2015–2016.
- What was measured: extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activities using fluorescent substrates, covering eight enzymes (acetate esterase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, β-glucosidase, arylsulfatase, phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, chitinase, lipase).
- Location and custody: analysis conducted at CEH Wallingford; results compiled for deposition into a central data portal (EIDC) and available as a CSV dataset (UgrassSoilFunctionalMeasurements.csv).
- Context: addresses soil security, soil organic matter, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem services; links soil biodiversity, edaphic status, and land management to soil function.

## Protocols

- 2.1 Soil sampling
  - 32 sites across the UK with adjacent contrasting land-use intensities.
  - Soil cores (15 x 5 cm) collected along 100 m land-use interface at 25 m intervals, yielding 5 paired replicates per site.
  - Sampling period: November 2015–February 2016.
  - Samples stored frozen at -20°C prior to processing for chemical, physical, molecular, and functional analyses.

- 2.2 Enzyme activity
  - Conducted at CEH Wallingford.
  - Enzyme activities measured as nmol product min-1 g-1 dry soil (EEA on a dry soil mass basis).
  - Enzymes assayed (with fluorescent substrates) and linked processes:
    - Acetate esterase (global activity/plant hemicellulose degradation)
    - Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (microbial activity potential)
    - β-glucosidase (glucose release from cellulose)
    - Arylsulfatase (sulfur cycle and mineralization)
    - Phosphatase (phosphorus mineralization)
    - Leucine aminopeptidase (protein degradation)
    - Chitinase (chitin degradation)
    - Lipase (lipid degradation)
  - Method details: soil slurry (1.5 g soil + 20 mL deionized water) mixed, then 30 µL slurry with 170 µL substrate in 96-well plates; incubated 4 hours at 28°C; fluorescence read every 30 minutes (330/342 nm excitation, 450/440 nm emission, respectively).
  - Quality controls: three methodological replicates per sample plus quenched standards; fluorescence monitored to ensure enzyme activity signals; results normalised to nmol min⁻¹ g⁻¹ dry soil.

## Data structure and outputs

- Data structure
  - Single flat CSV file with 450 data rows and 12 columns.
  - Key fields: id (unique reference), management_intensity (qualitative). Geography: latitude and longitude.
  - Enzyme measurements: ace, fda, glu, sul, pho, leu, chin, lip (all in nmol product min⁻¹ g⁻¹ dry soil).
  - Additional descriptor: NA indicates missing data.

- Data outputs
  - Primary dataset: UgrassSoilFunctionalMeasurements.csv
  - Data handling: results compiled from lab outputs and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals (EIDC).

## Lineage and provenance
- Sampling across 32 grassland sites with paired low/high intensity management; November 2015–February 2016, samples stored at -20°C.
- Enzyme analyses performed at CEH Wallingford; data compiled in Excel, then exported to CSV for deposition.
- Part of the U-GRASS project under the NERC Soil Security Programme (NE/M017125/1).

## Context and significance
- Emphasises soil security, organic matter’s role in soil quality, and the capacity of soils to support ecosystem services under changing climate and land use.
- Uses enzymatic activity as functional indicators linked to nutrient cycling and organic matter turnover.
- Integrates biodiversity context with soil function to understand how different soils and management regimes influence resilience and resistance to change.
