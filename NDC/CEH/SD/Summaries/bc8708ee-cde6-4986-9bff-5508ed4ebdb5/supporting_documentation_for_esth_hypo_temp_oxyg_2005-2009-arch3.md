# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from Esthwaite Water 2005 to 2009

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring data from Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.
- Fortnightly measurements of hypolimnion temperature (hypo_temp_c) and hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (hypo_DO_mgL).
- Measurement depth: approximately 13.5 to 15 meters from a boat at the deepest part of the lake (marked buoy).
- Timeframe: January 2005 through the end of 2009.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Frequency: fortnightly sampling.
- Instrument and procedure: WTW oxi340i meter lowered to sediment, readings taken while raised to about 0.5 meters above the measurement depth.
- Location: deepest part of Esthwaite Water, via a fixed buoy.
- Data scope: part of an ongoing long-term monitoring dataset.

## Quality Control
- Data are raw and have not yet undergone quality control or calibration.
- Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
- Missing data attributed to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Data structure
- Data provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns:
  - Date: date of measurement.
  - Hypo_temp_c: hypolimnion temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - Hypo_DO_mgL: hypolimnion dissolved oxygen concentration in mg/L.

## Funding
