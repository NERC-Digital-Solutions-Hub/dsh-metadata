# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from Esthwaite Water 2005 to 2009

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring dataset from fortnightly sampling at Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.
- Data available to download: hypolimnion temperature (hypo_temp_c) in °C and hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (hypo_DO_mgL) in mg/L.
- Measurements taken at depths between 13.5 and 15 m using a WTW oxi340i meter.
- Instrument lowered from a boat at a marked location (buoy) at the deepest part of the lake.
- Time period: January 2005 through the end of 2009.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling cadence.
- Measurement procedure: instrument lowered to the sediment and raised about 0.5 m to take readings.
- Location: buoy at the deepest part of Esthwaite Water.
- Part of an ongoing long-term monitoring effort.

## Data quality and quality control status
- Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
- Missing data are attributed to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Data structure and accessibility
- Stored as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns include:
  - Date: Date of measurement (with a descriptive label).
  - Hypo_temp_c: Hypolimnion temperature in degrees Celsius (with a descriptive label).
  - Hypo_DO_mgL: Hypolimnion dissolved oxygen concentration in mg per litre (with a descriptive label).

## Provenance and funding
- Data collection funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
- Authored by Feuchtmayr, H.; De Ville, M.M.; Fletcher, J.M.; Thackeray, S.J. (2024).

## Governance implications for Data Stewards
- Status: raw data pending quality control; requires formal QC/calibration before broader reuse.
- Actions to consider:
  - Document and apply standardized quality control procedures and calibration details.
  - Capture and preserve processing steps (e.g., cleaning, handling of missing data, any transforms).
  - Ensure comprehensive metadata: instrument specifications, calibration records, data collection context (location specifics, deployment times), and any quality flags.
  - Establish an update and versioning workflow to incorporate new measurements beyond 2009 if the monitoring continues.
  - Maintain clear data-access statements and track data availability, including any embargoes or usage restrictions.

## Usage notes and caveats
- Use with caution for analyses requiring calibrated measurements; raw data may need QC adjustments.
- Be aware of gaps due to weather or staffing when interpreting temporal trends.
