# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from Esthwaite Water 2005 to 2009

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring dataset from Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.
- Fortnightly sampling from 2005 to 2009.
- Variables: hypolimnion temperature (hypo_temp_c) in °C and hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (hypo_DO_mgL) in mg/L.
- Data collected from the deepest part of the lake at a marked buoy location.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling schedule.
- Measurements taken at depths between 13.5 and 15 m.
- Instrument: WTW oxi340i meter lowered from a boat to the sediment and retracted ~0.5 m to take readings.
- Location: buoy-based measurement at the deepest point of Esthwaite Water.

## Data availability and structure
- Data provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns: Date (measurement date), hypo_temp_c (hypolimnion temperature, °C), hypo_DO_mgL (hypolimnion DO, mg/L).
- Data are raw and not yet quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data primarily due to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Temporal scope and location
- Timeframe: January 2005 through end of 2009.
- Location: Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.

## Quality control and limitations
- Not yet quality controlled/calibrated; suitable for initial analyses after QC.
- Some missing data, influenced by practical constraints during fieldwork.

## Funding and programme context
- Funding: Natural Environment Research Council (NE/R016429/1).
- Part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.

## Relevance for monitoring aims
- Demonstrates environmental condition over time using standardized measurement methods.
- Data are suitable for validation, cleaning, and transformation to enable consistent reporting of environmental health trends.
- Clear formats (CSV) facilitate integration into dashboards, maps, or reports.
- Dataset aligns with goals of increasing data value through re-use and enabling access to underlying data for interpretability and policy evaluation.
