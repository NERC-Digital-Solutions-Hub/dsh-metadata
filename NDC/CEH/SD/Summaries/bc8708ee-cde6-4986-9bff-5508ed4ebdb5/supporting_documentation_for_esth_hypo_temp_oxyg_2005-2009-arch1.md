# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from Esthwaite Water 2005 to 2009.

- Overview
  - Long-term monitoring dataset from Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.
  - Fortnightly sampling from Jan 2005 to end of 2009.
  - Variables: hypolimnion temperature (hypo_temp_c, °C) and hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (hypo_DO_mgL, mg/L).

- Sampling regime and collection methods
  - Depth of measurement: 13.5–15 m.
  - Instrumentation: WTW oxi340i meter.
  - Procedure: meter lowered to sediment and raised about 0.5 m to obtain measurement.
  - Location: from a boat at a marked buoy at the deepest part of the lake.
  - Frequency: fortnightly observations.

- Data structure and content
  - Data provided as a CSV file.
  - Columns include Date and the two measurements (hypo_temp_c and hypo_DO_mgL); each column accompanied by a descriptive label.
  - Data are raw measurements; not yet quality controlled or calibrated.

- Quality control and data quality
  - No formal quality control or calibration performed yet.
  - Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
  - Missing data occur due to weather conditions or staff shortages.

- Location, scope, and provenance
  - Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.
  - Part of UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
  - Funded by Natural Environment Research Council (award NE/R016429/1).

- Implications for analysis
  - Suitable for investigating relationships between hypolimnetic temperature and oxygen over time.
  - Be mindful of gaps, raw status, and lack of calibration when performing trend analyses or cross-variable correlations.
  - Data are from a single deep-water site, which may limit broader generalizations without additional context.
