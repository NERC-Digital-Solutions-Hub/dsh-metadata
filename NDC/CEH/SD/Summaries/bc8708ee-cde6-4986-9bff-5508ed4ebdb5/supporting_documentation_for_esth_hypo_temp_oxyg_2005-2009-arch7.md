# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from Esthwaite Water 2005 to 2009.

## Purpose and content
- Long-term monitoring dataset from fortnightly sampling at Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.
- Variables: hypo_temp_c (°C) and hypo_DO_mgL (mg/L).
- Time coverage: January 2005 to end of 2009.
- Depth context: measurements taken at ~13.5–15 m depth, by lowering a WTW oxi340i meter to the sediment and pulling it back up to around 0.5 m to take the measurement, at a marked buoy location at the deepest part of the lake.

## Data collection method
- Instrument: WTW oxi340i meter.
- Sampling from a boat at the deepest-part buoy.

## Data format
- CSV file with columns:
  - Date (date of measurement)
  - Hypo_temp_c (hypolimnion temperature, °C)
  - Hypo_DO_mgL (hypolimnion dissolved oxygen, mg/L)
- Each column is described (Description) in the dataset metadata.

## Quality control
- Data are raw and not yet quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data largely due to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Spatial and temporal context
- Spatial: single measurement location (a buoy at the deepest part of Esthwaite Water); coordinates are not provided in the document.
- Temporal: fortnightly sampling from 2005 through 2009.

## Data limitations for GIS
- Calibration and quality control pending; use with caution for map products.
- Limited spatial coverage (one fixed site) and potential data gaps.

## Data provenance and funding
- Funding: Natural Environment Research Council award NE/R016429/1, part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
