# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from Esthwaite Water 2005 to 2009

- Overview
  - Long-term monitoring dataset from fortnightly sampling at Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.
  - Data available: hypolimnion temperature (hypo_temp_c) and hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (hypo_DO_mgL).
  - Measurements taken at a depth of 13.5–15 m from a boat at the deepest part of the lake; location is a marked buoy.
  - Time period: January 2005 to the end of 2009.

- Sampling regime and collection methods

    - Date: Date of measurement
    - Hypo_temp_c: Hypolimnion temperature in degrees Celsius
    - Hypo_DO_mgL: Hypolimnion dissolved oxygen concentration in mg/L
  - Each column accompanied by a Description field explaining the variable.

- Quality control and limitations
  - Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
  - Data have been double entered and visually checked.
