# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from Esthwaite Water 2005 to 2009.

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring dataset from Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.
- Fortnightly sampling conducted from January 2005 to end of 2009.
- Focuses on hypolimnion temperature and dissolved oxygen.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Measurements taken at a depth of 13.5 to 15 m.
- Method: lower a WTW oxi340i meter from a boat to near the sediment, then pull back up about 0.5 m to obtain the measurement.
- Sampling location: marked buoy at the deepest part of the lake.

## Data available
- Variables included: hypo_temp_c (hypolimnion temperature in °C) and hypo_DO_mgL (hypolimnion dissolved oxygen concentration in mg/L).

## Timeframe
- Data cover January 2005 through the end of 2009.

## Data structure and format
- Provided as a comma separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns include:
  - Date
  - Hypo_temp_c (Hypolimnion temperature in °C)
  - Hypo_DO_mgL (Hypolimnion dissolved oxygen in mg/L)
- Each variable accompanied by a Description note in the dataset structure.

## Quality control and data quality
- The data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data are due to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Location and context
- Site: Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, England.
- Deepest-part measurement location (buoy).

## Funding and project context
- Funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NE/R016429/1).
- Part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.

## Access and notes for data users
- Data are available to download (dataset accompanying the study).
- Users should account for the lack of formal QC/calibration in analyses and interpret missing values as weather/staff-related gaps.
