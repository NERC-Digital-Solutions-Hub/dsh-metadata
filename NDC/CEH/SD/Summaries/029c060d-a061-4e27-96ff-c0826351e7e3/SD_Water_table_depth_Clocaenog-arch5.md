# Details of data structure for 'Water table depth_Clocaenog.csv'

## Dataset scope and structure
- Single spreadsheet containing 10 columns.

## Temporal and spatial coverage
- Date column covers 13/05/1999 to 30/06/2015.
- Measurements correspond to water table depth (in centimetres) from the soil surface for experimental plots 1 to 9 (columns 2–10).

## Data values and encoding
- Water table depths are numeric values in centimetres.
- Values recorded as 'below detectable limit' when the water is below the detectable depth.

## Documentation context
- Supplement to the supporting documentation for data series described in: Clocaenog_supporting documentation_Data series.rtf.

## Metadata and governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure metadata clearly defines:
  - Column mappings (Date; Plot 1–9 depths).
  - Unit specification (centimetres) and how non-detect values are represented.
  - Temporal coverage and exact date formats.
- Link dataset to broader Clocaenog data documentation to support discoverability and reuse.
- Validate data quality with attention to:
  - Consistent date formatting and complete date coverage.
  - Consistent handling of 'below detectable limit' across records.
  - Documentation of measurement methods and any site-specific context missing from this extract.

## Quality and stewardship recommendations
- Preserve provenance by connecting to the associated supporting documentation.
- Consider versioning and publishing in a data portal with attributes for site, plots, measurement method, and units.
- If updates occur, maintain a changelog and note any re-interpretation of 'below detectable limit' entries.
