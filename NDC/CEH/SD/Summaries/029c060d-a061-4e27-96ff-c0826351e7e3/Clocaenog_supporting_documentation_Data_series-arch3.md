# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

## Overview
- Climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog forest to simulate drought and warming for upland moorland over the next 20–30 years.
- Automated roof technology and curtains create controlled drought and warming treatments with replication and controls.
- On-site since 1998; powered by solar and wind; located in North East Wales with typical upland heath vegetation.

## Experimental design and site context
- Site and vegetation: upland western Atlantic moorland (Calluna vulgaris-dominated), with Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum, and other species; humo-ferric podzol soil type; coordinates SJ019519 (53.055°N, -3.465°W).
- Treatments and replication: two climate treatments (drought and warming) plus three controls, arranged in replicates across three blocks (total 9 plots, each 4 m x 5 m).
  - Drought: retractable polyethylene roof reduces rainfall (approx. 20% annual reduction; up to ~80% of rain excluded within drought periods). Operated May–Sept 1999–2011; since 2012April–October. Curtains do not operate in high winds (>10 m/s).
  - Warming: retractable aluminium curtains reduce nighttime heat loss; nightly operation triggered by dusk with a rain-retraction safeguard. Annual rainfall reduction ~14%. Curtains also paused in high winds.
- Plot and layout details: three replicates for each treatment per block; appendix with plot and quadrat layout provided.

## Data collection and datasets (scope and methods)
- Data collection is extensive, spanning abiotic and biotic responses, using multiple instrumentation and methods. Data coverage ranges from 1998 onward, with AWS data continuing to 2015 and beyond in some datasets.
- Data categories and key methods:
  - AWS meteorological data: hourly averages; sensors include air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, solar and net radiation, PAR, wind speed/direction, barometric pressure; mounted at 4 m after initial thefts.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily soil/air temperature and soil moisture measured with T107/CS616 sensors; 5–20 cm depth; data logged daily.
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry: storage rain gauge (biweekly); warren spring collectors for chemistry (pH, nitrate, chloride, sulfate, DOC, ammonium).
  - Throughfall: plot-level rainfall captured biweekly; data used to derive percent change per treatment relative to site rainfall.
  - Water table depth: measured with permeable tubes from 2009 onward; manual biweekly readings.
  - Soil respiration: fortnightly measurements with soil collars; multiple measurement systems over time (CIRAS-2, LI-COR 8100, automated setups from 2013–2014); includes root/heterotroph respiration components.
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): measured with static chambers attached to same collars; gas samples analyzed via gas chromatography.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): measured 2002–2004 and 2011 using Perspex chambers with CIRAS-2 and LI-COR 6400; adjustments for biomass differences in analyses.
  - Photosynthesis: infrequent measurements using leaf cuvettes and CIRAS IRGA; standardized lighting curves for selected species.
  - Vegetation surveys (pin-point biomass): annual surveys (1998–2012 and beyond) using pin quadrats; conversion of pin hits to biomass using species-specific calibration; includes bryophytes pooled; retrospective biomass calibrations.
  - Canopy reflectance: ground-based spectrometer measurements (NDVI and PRI indices) in 2001–2002 and 2003–2004.
  - Vegetation phenology, growth, and pathogens: shoot elongation, budburst, and phenophase assessments for Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum; annual maximum growth measurements for shrubs.
  - Vegetation chemistry: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates from green and litter material.
  - Litterfall: collectors monthly (1999–2002) and later periodically; litter dried and weighed; carbon and nitrogen analyses conducted in CEH labs.
  - Root biomass: multiple core-based methods across years (2003–2013), including different core sizes and extraction protocols; root tissue processed to determine biomass.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012) with DOC extraction and correction for microbial biomass carbon.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: incubation cores with ammonium and nitrate analyses (1998–2004); paired initial/final cores used to derive net mineralisation rates.
  - SOM/SOC and bulk density: soil core analyses to derive soil organic matter, soil organic carbon, and bulk density, then converted to g m-2.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tension lysimeters (1998 onward); analysis of pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, and DOC; samples analyzed via ion chromatography and TOC.
- Data accessibility and governance:
  - Data are listed by dataset name with supporting documentation; not all smaller or post-2015 data are stored in the EIDC.
  - Points of contact for data details: Sabine Reinsch and Bridget Emmett at CEH Bangor.
  - Data are publicly shared where possible, but legacy practices may hinder some metadata completeness or data sharing at the origin.

## Data processing and units
- Unit conversions and data processing notes provided for key datasets:
  - Soil respiration and NEE conversions between g CO2 m-2 h-1 and mg CO2-C m-2 h-1; conversions use standard factors and ideal gas law calculations.
  - Biomass and pin-hit conversions (pin-point to biomass; species-specific calibration tables).
  - NDVI and PRI calculations for canopy reflectance data.
- Legacy data caveats:
  - Some datasets use legacy processing methods; documentation acknowledges that current best practices were not always followed historically.
  - Data quality control described as graphic/manual in places, with some datasets lacking modern automated QA.

## Data quality, challenges, and governance considerations
- Challenges highlighted by the monitoring authors:
  - Missing or inconsistent data due to equipment failures, sampling gaps, or throughfall measurement issues (e.g., funnel loss, overflow).
  - Throughfall-based treatment means data can be excluded from means if data quality is compromised; infilling used in some years.
  - Changes in measurement technology over time (CIRAS-2, LICOR 8100, automated soil respiration) requiring careful data harmonization.
  - Some datasets are infrequent or retrospective, complicating direct comparability across years.
- Governance implications for monitoring frameworks:
  - Emphasizes the need for robust metadata, data provenance, and standardised conversions across long-term datasets.
  - Highlights data sharing barriers when historical datasets were not prepared with open metadata at the source.
  - Demonstrates the value of documenting calibration factors, conversion equations, and methodological changes to support reuse and policy-relevant analyses.

## Appendices and site layout
- Appendix 1: Site layout and grid reference details.

- Appendix 3: Plot layout with quadrats and measurement areas; oxygen/lysimeter layouts (lysimeters, PQs, SSs) as part of the 2012 plot layout.

## Practical implications for policy and monitoring practice
- Provides a long-term, multi-dimensional dataset framework linking climate manipulation (drought and warming) to ecosystem-level responses (soil respiration, NEE, canopy function, vegetation dynamics, litter input, soil chemistry, and microbial processes).
- Demonstrates the complexity of aligning diverse data streams with treatment effects over decades, including data standardization, metadata quality, and transparent reporting of data processing steps.
- Highlights the importance of documenting data provenance, measurement methods, and calibration factors to enable policy-relevant analyses and cross-site comparability.
