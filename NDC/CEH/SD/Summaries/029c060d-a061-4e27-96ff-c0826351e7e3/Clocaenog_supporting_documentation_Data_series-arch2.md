# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Purpose and scope
  - Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming for upland moorland over the next 20–30 years.
  - Established in 1998 at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales; site designed to be solar/wind powered and remotely operable.
  - Replicated treatments: drought and warming with three plots each, plus three control plots, across four blocks (total 9 plots).

- Site description
  - Environment: upland west-atlantic moorland; dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather) with Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum also present.
  - Flora and structure: detailed plant list including bryophytes; soil is humo-ferric podzol with variable Eg and Bh horizons.
  - Growing season: June–August (with shoulder seasons April–May and Sept–Oct); winter dormancy November–February.

- Climate change treatments
  - Drought (D)
    - Timing: May–Sept (1999–2011); since 2012, April–October.
    - Mechanism: retractable polyethylene roof over 4 m x 5 m plots triggers on rainfall; excludes ~80% of rain during active drought window, reducing annual rainfall by ~20%.
    - Constraints: roof inactive in wind >10 m/s; some small rain events not detected by tipping-bucket sensor may still be excluded.
  - Warming (W)
    - Mechanism: retractable aluminum mesh curtains over plots; reflect 96–97% of infrared radiation, reducing night-time heat loss.
    - Rainfall interaction: roof retracted during rain to preserve rainfall; overall annual rainfall reduction ~14%.
    - Constraints: high winds disable curtains.
  - Experimental design
    - Treatments distributed across 9 plots with a block structure to mirror shading and microclimate effects.
    - Tables summarize timing and magnitude of drought and warming adjustments by year.

- Datasets and data collection (data processing and storage)
  - Data management
    - On-site automated weather station (AWS) and micro-meteorological sensors collect a broad suite of environmental variables.
    - Data are stored in the CEH EIDC where available; some smaller or post-2015 data may not be stored there.
    - Key contacts for data: Sabine Reinsch and Bridget Emmett (CEH Bangor).
  - Data types and datasets
    - AWS meteorological data: hourly/minutely measurements (temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, solar radiation, net radiation, pressure).
    - Micro-meteorological plot data: soil/air temperature and soil moisture (various depths).
    - Rainfall data: storage rain gauge (site-level rainfall), with biweekly chemical analyses (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium).
    - Throughfall data: plot-level rainfall collected biweekly; used to derive plot-specific rainfall changes per treatment.
    - Water table depth: biweekly measurements using permeable tubes (2009 onward).
    - Soil respiration and trace gases: fortnightly/monthly measurements using collars and closed-chamber setups; includes CH4 and N2O fluxes; automated vs. manual methods described.
    - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): measured in select years (2002–2004, 2011) with CIRAS-2 and LI-COR systems; photosynthesis vs. respiration separated in some years.
    - Photosynthesis: infrequent measurements (2001–2003) using leaf cuvette and CIRAS-2.
    - Vegetation biomass: Pin-point vegetation surveys (1998–2012, and 2007–present in parts), with conversion to biomass using species-specific calibration; annual or multi-year time steps.
    - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometer (2001–2002, 2003–2004).
    - Phenology, growth and pathogens: shoot elongation and phenophase tracking across C. vulgaris, V. myrtillus, E. nigrum (years 1999–2009 in various samples).
    - Vegetation chemistry: elemental analysis (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates) of green and litter material.
    - Litterfall: collectors across plots (1999–2009); biomass converted to g m^-2 and analyzed for C and N.
    - Root biomass: multiple methods across years (2003–2013) including soil cores and WinRHIZO analysis.
    - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation technique (2000, 2001, 2012).
    - Nitrogen mineralisation: incubation-based NH4+/NO3- analysis (1998–2004).
    - SOM, SOC, bulk density: soil cores and standard 20/105/375°C dry-weight methods; conversions to g m^-2.
    - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers; biweekly sampling for pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, NH4.
  - Data quality and limitations
    - Legacy data: some processing steps and best practices not consistently documented; units and conversions provided, but some data processing notes reflect historical methods.
    - Data gaps and recovery: occasional data loss or plot exclusions in throughfall and rainfall datasets; some data gaps due to equipment changes or maintenance.
    - Data accessibility: most core datasets referenced; some smaller datasets or post-2015 data may not be in the central repository.
  - Data processing and quality control
    - Basic visual quality checks used on AWS/micro-met data; consistency checks for pin-hit biomass conversions; cross-year calibration where applicable.
    - Throughfall-derived treatment means may exclude plots with data loss; occasional infilling with year-average reductions.

- Equipment and protocols (high-level)
  - AWS equipment and sensors
    - Temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, solar radiation, net radiation, PAR; data collected hourly or minutely depending on sensor.
    - Early deployment (1 m) moved to 4 m mast after thefts; data quality controlled visually.
  - Plot-level sensors
    - Soil temperature and moisture sensors (depths down to 20 cm; TDR-based moisture in later years).
  - Gas flux measurements
    - Soil respiration and CH4/N2O fluxes via static chambers and IRGAs; adjustments and unit conversions explained for cross-technology data.
  - Vegetation and litter measurements
    - Pin-point biomass calibration; litterfall collectors; canopy reflectance measurements; phenology scoring; chemical analyses in accredited labs.

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy evaluation
  - Provides a comprehensive, multi-taxa, multi-method dataset to assess environmental health and climate-change treatment effects over time.
  - Standardized approaches and cross-method conversions facilitate integration with other monitoring programs.
  - Highlights challenges in data integration, long-term storage, and accessibility of legacy and diverse datasets for policy performance analyses.
