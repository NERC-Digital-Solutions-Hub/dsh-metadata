# Clocaenog supporting documentation: Data series and SD_Water_table_depth_Clocaenog.rtf - Details of data structure

- Overview
  - The document appears to consist of two supporting files related to Clocaenog data: one for general supporting documentation of a data series, and one detailing the structure of the water table depth data.

- Included files
  - Clocaenog_supporting_documentation_Data series.rtf: Supporting documentation for the data series.
  - SD_Water_table_depth_Clocaenog.rtf: Details of the data structure for the water table depth data.

- What this means for data governance
  - Indicates the data series is accompanied by dedicated metadata/documentation, which is essential for discoverability and proper use.
  - The separate data-structure document suggests there is a defined data schema or dictionary for the water table depth dataset.

- Gaps/risks to consider
  - The filenames alone do not reveal the completeness or quality of metadata (variable definitions, units, methods, provenance, and licensing).
  - Potential need to ensure both documents are up-to-date, versioned, and linked to the actual datasets in the catalog.

- Recommended actions for data stewards
  - Verify that the supporting documentation and data-structure details are comprehensive and align with the datasets.
  - Ensure metadata includes data creator/sharer, data collection methods, variable definitions, units, temporal/spatial scope, and data quality notes.
  - Link these documentation files to the corresponding datasets in the data portal; confirm access permissions and licensing.
  - Establish version control and update notifications to reflect any changes in the data or structure.
