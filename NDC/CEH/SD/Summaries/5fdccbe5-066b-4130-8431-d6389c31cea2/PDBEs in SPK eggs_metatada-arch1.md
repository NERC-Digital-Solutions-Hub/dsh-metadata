# EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

- Egg sampling and archiving: Failed or abandoned sparrowhawk eggs were collected by licensed egg collectors and archived as part of the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) in the UK. Eggs were sampled to cover the longest temporal period within the smallest geographic area (east England, within 250 km of the Welsh border). Sampling years spanned 1985–2007 across 10 years, with 3–5 eggs per year from different nests; when multiple eggs from a nest were available, one was randomly chosen since laying order was unknown.

- Morphological data and storage: Egg weight, length, and breadth measured; shells washed, air-dried, reweighed; contents homogenised and stored at -20°C until analysis. Wet weight and lipid content were recorded (n = 43).

- PBDE analysis: Egg homogenates were extracted, cleaned, and analysed by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) using a 30 m CPSIL-8 CB column, calibrated with seven PBDE standards (2.5–250 pg/µL). Analyzed for 27 PBDE congeners (tri-Octa BDE: 17, 28, 32, 35, 37, 47, 49, 51, 66, 71, 75, 77, 85, 99, 100, 118, 119, 126, 128, 138, 153, 154, 166, 183, 190, 196, 197).

- Detection limits and QA/QC: Instrument LoD ranged from 2.5 pg/µL (tri-hexa BDEs) to 12.5 pg/µL (Octa BDEs), equivalent to egg wet-weight LoDs of 0.0631, 0.126, and 0.316 pg/g for the respective groups. Five procedural blanks were run; concentrations were blank-corrected. Mean recoveries for 13128 C12-labelled congeners were 73.4–95.6% and recovery-corrected. A QC standard containing five PBDEs (2.5–250 pg/µL) was used; batches passed QC if concentrations were within ±10% of expected values.

- Identification of additional octa-BDEs: During the study, three extra potential octa-brominated PBDEs (BDEs 201, 202, 203) were detected alongside known octa homologues (including 196 and 197) with characteristic mass fragments (640, 643; and 320, 802). The distinctive pattern across peaks suggested BDEs 201, 202, 203. Because calibration for these congeners was unavailable, their concentrations were semi-quantified using the calibration curves for BDEs 196 and 197.

- Desiccation correction and volume estimation: Concentrations were corrected for desiccation by multiplying by the total egg weight/volume ratio. Egg volume was estimated using V = 0.51 × L^2 × B, where L is length and B is breadth. For damaged eggs where reliable volume could not be calculated, the mean volume/weight ratio for the other eggs that year was used.

- Shell index: A shell-thickness proxy calculated as shell weight (mg) / (shell length × breadth in mm).

- Handling data below detection limit (LoD): For congeners where some observations were below LoD, values below LoD were interpolated if <20% of observations were below LoD; if >20% were below LoD, those congeners were not used in statistical analyses. For ΣPBDE, concentrations below LoD were set to zero only if those congeners were detected.

- Data transformations: The distribution of individual congeners and ΣPBDEs was skewed. Box-Cox transformations were applied to achieve normality for statistical testing.

- Statistical analyses and modeling: Associations between ΣPBDEs, individual congeners, and shell index were assessed using Pearson correlations. Temporal trends were analyzed with linear, quadratic, or split-line regressions. Relationships with time, land-use, human population density, and eggshell thickness were modeled using linear and polynomial regressions. Model adequacy was evaluated using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

- Population density near nests: Human density was estimated with a “sphere of influence” approach at 200 m resolution using the 2001 UK census data. A = Σ(pop_i / r_i^2), where r_i^2 = (E_i − E_0)^2 + (N_i − N_0)^2, incorporating eastings (E) and northings (N).

- Land-use around nests: Land-use within a 10 km^2 area around each nest was classified using GIS from the 2000 UK Land Cover Map (1 km resolution) and condensed into five groups: urban, arable, grassland, woodland, semi-natural. Land-use was used both as percentages and as a dominant class to model ΣPBDE and individual congeners.

- Data scope and undamaged eggs: Shell index analyses were conducted only on undamaged eggs where reliable shell index could be calculated.
