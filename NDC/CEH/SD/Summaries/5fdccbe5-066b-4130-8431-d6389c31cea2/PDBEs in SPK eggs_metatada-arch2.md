# Long-term PBDE concentrations in sparrowhawk eggs from the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme, England (1985-2007)

## Overview
- Study uses failed or abandoned sparrowhawk eggs from the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) in the UK to assess polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) contamination over time.
- Aims to analyze temporal trends and associations with environmental and foraging context using standardized monitoring data.
- Identified and quantified PBDE congeners to examine patterns across a 1985–2007 period, including detection of additional octa-BDEs (201, 202, 203).

## Sampling and data collection
- Eggs sourced from PBMS archives by licensed collectors; eggs archived as part of ongoing monitoring of top predators.
- Selection criteria focused on maximizing temporal coverage while minimizing geographic spread: eggs from the region directly east of England within 250 km of the Welsh border.
- For each sampling year (up to 10 years), 3–5 eggs from different nests were analyzed; when multiple eggs were available from a nest, the egg analyzed was chosen at random.
- Sampling years determined by egg availability in the archive; overall span covered 1985–2007.
- Egg characteristics recorded when possible (egg weight, length, breadth); some eggs damaged, affecting volume/weight calculations.

## Laboratory analysis and QA/QC
- Egg contents homogenised and stored at -20°C until analysis.
- PBDEs quantified by GC-MS using a 30 m CPSIL-8 CB column; calibration with seven PBDE standards (range 2.5–250 pg/µL).
- Analyzed for 27 PBDE congeners (tri-, hepta-, and octa-BDEs), including: 17, 28, 32, 35, 37, 47, 49, 51, 66, 71, 75, 77, 85, 99, 100, 118, 119, 126, 128, 138, 153, 154, 166, 183, 190, 196, 197.
- Instrument detection limits (LoD) ranged from 2.5 pg/µL (tri- to hexa-BDEs) to 12.5 pg/µL (Octa-BDEs); corresponding egg wet-weight LoDs calculated.
- Five procedural blanks per batch; samples blank-corrected.
- Mean recoveries for labeled BDE congeners (28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183) ranged 73.4–95.6%; concentrations recovery-corrected.
- A quality control (QC) standard with five PBDEs (2.5–250 pg/µL) used to check precision; batches passed QC if concentrations were within ±10% of expected values.
- Identification of three additional octa-BDEs (BDEs 201, 202, 203) based on distinctive mass fragments and retention patterns; semi-quantified using calibration curves for BDEs 196/197 due to absence of corresponding calibration standards.

## Data handling and processing
- PBDE concentrations expressed on a wet-weight basis and desiccation-corrected using total egg weight/volume ratio.
- Egg volume estimated via V = 0.51 × L^2 × B; when eggs were damaged, mean volume/weight ratio from other eggs in that year used for adjustment.
- Shell index calculated as shell weight (mg) / (shell length × breadth (mm)).
- For congeners with concentrations below the LoD, interpolation applied for those congeners when <20% of observations were below LoD; not applied when >20% of observations were below LoD and no analyses conducted for those datasets.
- ΣPBDE concentrations computed from detected congeners, with below-LoD values set to zero for this sum.

## Statistical analyses and modelling
- Concentrations across congeners and ΣPBDEs presented on a wet-weight basis and adjusted for desiccation.
- Data transformation: Box-Cox transformations used to normalize skewed distributions prior to statistical testing.
- Handling nondetects: interpolation applied where appropriate (below-LoD data ≤20% of observations).
- Relationships explored using:
  - Pearson’s rank correlation to assess associations between ΣPBDEs, congeners, and shell index.
  - Temporal trends examined with linear, quadratic, or split-line regression models.
  - Relationships with time, land-use, human population density, and eggshell thickness modeled via linear or polynomial regression.
- Model selection guided by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
- Analyses involving shell index restricted to undamaged eggs.
- Human population density near nest sites estimated with a sphere-of-influence approach at 200 m resolution, incorporating UK census data.
- Land-use around nest sites (within a 10 km2 area) derived from GIS data (2000 UK Land Cover Map), condensed into five classes: urban, arable, grassland, woodland, semi-natural. Analyses considered both the percentage composition and the majority class within the 10 km radius as predictors.

## Environmental and data-access context
- Land-use and population-context data derived from UK-wide sources to contextualize PBDE exposure relative to foraging habitat and human influence.
- Data integration supports examining potential links between PBDE burdens in eggs and environmental/anthropogenic factors across time and space.
- PBMS background and methodology cited to underpin ongoing environmental risk assessment for top predators in Britain.

## Implications for monitoring and data reuse
- Demonstrates standardized data processing and QA/QC in long-term contaminant monitoring.
- Facilitates cross-year comparisons of PBDE body burdens in top predators, contributing to policy evaluation and environmental health assessment.
- Highlights ongoing challenges and opportunities to increase data value by integrating monitoring data with broader environmental datasets and by improving access to underlying data for reuse and scrutiny.
