# SEOSAW Field Manual

## Overview
- Describes a standardized method for establishing long-term plots in savannas, woodlands, and forests, with applicability to large, multi-site monitoring and compatibility with global comparisons.
- Emphasizes data quality, verifiability, and consistency to support environmental health and policy performance monitoring over time.
- Supports data entry via Android tablets (Open Data Kit) and Excel sheets; aims to facilitate data sharing and integration while acknowledging field-based compromises.

## Plot Design and Location
- Locate plots in homogeneous soil types and land-use history; obtain informed consent from landowners/users.
- Recommended long-term monitoring plot sizes: 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 hectares; 1.0 ha square plots preferred.
- Random or pre-determined stratified placement to minimize bias; regularly spaced plots can aid analyses.
- Use GIS to randomly place points within strata; carry extra points as reserves.
- Drone-assisted site assessment advised to evaluate disturbance proximity and drainage prior to fieldwork.
- Data entry and site assessment tools: tablet-based apps, drone software (e.g., Pix4D Capture, DJI GS Pro); post-processing to create areal statistics.

## Shape, Orientation, and Slope
- Plot shapes: circular, square, or rectangular; squares preferred when feasible due to smaller perimeter-to-area ratio, aiding measurement ease and boundary management.
- Align principal axes roughly north–south and east–west for squares/rectangles; record bearings, latitude, longitude, and elevation.
- Account for slope by sampling an area-based footprint rather than a flat plane; record average slope/aspect and corner altitudes for later planar area correction.

## Plot Size and Timing
- Size influences perimeter effects, biomass distributions, and data normality; 1 ha is standard for long-term monitoring; smaller plots (0.75, 0.5, 0.25 ha) acceptable in homogeneous or dense vegetation with ≥25 stems.
- Timing of measurements should be season-consistent to reduce water-content–related diameter variation; dry season is often better for easier measurements, but rainy-season visits aid species identification and voucher collection.

## Plot Visibility and Marking
- For long-term monitoring, mark plot corners or center with durable markers (concrete posts, steel droppers, or other long-lasting options); in some contexts, use cryptic marking to avoid bias.
- If marking is inappropriate, employ buried markers or detailed maps; use cryptic or less visible markers to locate plots.
- Maintain markers to withstand corrosion, fire, termites, etc., and consider adding a 20 m grid within plots to aid relocation and reduce inclusion/exclusion errors.

## Plot Boundaries and Data Recording
- Boundary measurement performed with at least two people; minimize vegetation disturbance during setup.
- Record complete plot metadata (design, location, sampling, environmental conditions, land-use rights, presence of fire, large herbivores, etc.) on SEOSAW plot data sheets.

## What to Measure (Stems and Trees)
- Measure all stems that meet inclusion criteria: base within ≥50% of stem inside plot and diameter above a defined threshold (commonly 5 cm or 10 cm at the POM).
- Include living, dead, standing, and fallen stems; recruit designs may require counting smaller stems in subplots.
- Aim for at least 200 trees measured per main plot to support biomass and diversity analyses.

## Diameter, Point of Measurement (POM), and Accuracy
- Diameter measured at a defined POM (default 1.3 m; alternative 0.3 m if necessary).
- POM is the straight-line distance from soil to the POM, not the tree height; adjust for slope or lean as needed.
- If a stem is deformed, forked, buttressed, or has other anomalies, adjust POM accordingly (e.g., 30 cm above deformity or fork base).
- For climbing plants or large vines, measure at multiple points and capture the maximum relevant diameter for comparability.
- Record exact POM for every stem and use tagging to facilitate re-measurement; paint or tag bases (20 cm above POM) to aid relocation.

## Diameter Measurement Methods
- Use diameter tape for stems ≥ 5 cm; calipers for smaller ones.
- Record diameter to the nearest 0.1 cm; note “large tree” for DBH > 10× the minimum threshold to minimize misreads.
- If a full circumference is not accessible, apply half-diameter methods (estimate on half the stem and multiply by two) and document method in data.

## Multiple Stems and Tagging
- For trees with multiple stems, identify a base ID (the earliest tagged stem) and assign others accordingly; never reuse tags.
- Tag stems with durable markers; if tagging affects plot use, bury tags at base instead.

## Marking and Mapping Stem Location
- Mark stems with metal tags or painted numbers; attach tags 20 cm above the POM to ease relocation.
- Create stem-location maps to support re-measurement, using 10 m strip coordinates within plots; use GPS (preferably differential if available) for precise coordinates.

## Health, Mortality, and Topkill
- Record alive/dead status; topkilled stems show no signs of life above the POM and may require extra notes on mortality mode and decay class.
- Use standardized codes for causes of death (e.g., Neighbouring tree, Elephant, Fire, Human, Termites); where uncertain, use “Q” (Can’t tell) and add notes.

## Species Identification and Vouchers
- Assign species or morphospecies; involve a botanist/parataxonomist; collect voucher specimens when possible and store in herbaria.
- Document identifications, updates during re-measurements, and use reference works; photographs of living material and herbarium specimens are valuable for verification.

## Height Measurement
- Height measurement is time-consuming; use site-specific height-diameter relationships to estimate height from DBH when feasible.
- If accurate height data are essential, measure a representative subsample (e.g., ~50 trees across DBH classes) and assess predictive strength; otherwise, use trigonometric or eye-based height estimates as appropriate.

## Stems on Termite Mounds
- Note stems located on termite mounds because mounds host distinct flora and may influence analyses of diversity and biomass.

## Data Recording Protocols
- Use separate data sheets for live stems, topkilled stems, recruits, and stumps; standardized forms improve data cleaning and cross-census comparability.
- Re-measurements should reference previous census data; insert blank rows for previous stems on re-surveys to retain data lineage.
- Maintain a consistent tagging system: do not reuse tag numbers; record base IDs for recruitment and resprouting analyses.

## Small Stems and Regeneration
- Define small-stem classes: poles (5–10 cm), saplings (3 mm up from 0.1 m, <5 cm DBH), seedlings (<3 mm at 0.1 m height).
- Count small stems in a 2 m x 50 m transect within each 0.25 ha plot; two transects per plot; no diameter measurements required for these subplots.
- Consider more intensive sampling or tagging if regeneration or understory diversity is a focus.

## Stumps and Coarse Woody Debris
- Stumps: record diameter at top, height, diameter at 0.3 m above base, decay class, species if possible, and cause of break; do not necessarily tag.
- Coarse woody debris: define as non-rooted woody material; measure along perpendicular transects crossing the plot center; record diameter at intersection, piece length, decay class, and species; estimate density, volume, and biomass using established equations (e.g., Waddell et al. 2002).

## Plot Re-measurement and Demographics
- Re-measure stems about every 5 years; shorter intervals at first can help resolve initial census errors and improve species identifications.
- Re-measurements should compare with prior censuses; relocate stems, re-record POMs, and note any changes or anomalies.
- For demography: tag all stems, track bases with stems, and maintain base IDs across censuses to analyze recruitment, resprouting, and topkill mortality.
- When stems are dead in two censuses, consider removal from field sheets to minimize data clutter.

## Annexes and Data Sheets
- Annexes provide plot data sheets and stem data sheets with structured fields for comprehensive metadata, plot design, location, sampling details, and stem-level measurements.
- Annex 1 describes the Plot Data Sheet (fields for plot name, date, investigators, area, shape, coordinates, environmental context, land-use details, and protocol references).
- Annex 2 describes the Stem Data Sheet (fields for subplot, tag numbers, base tag, species, POM, DBH, alive/dead status, stem condition, decay, height, miscelaneous notes, and cross-references).
