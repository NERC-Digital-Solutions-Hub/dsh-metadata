# SEOSAW Field Manual

- A field protocol for establishing and monitoring long-term plots across savannas, woodlands, and forests in southern Africa, with an emphasis on compatibility for global comparisons and data sharing.
- Aimed at enabling consistent data collection, governance, and reuse by researchers, land managers, and data stewards.

## Data governance and stewardship

- Emphasizes standardization, metadata, and documentation to ensure datasets are discoverable and usable by others.
- Includes explicit version control history for the manual (V0.0 to V3.0) to support traceability and updates.
- Data collection is designed to be interoperable with global networks (e.g., RAINFOR) and to support long-term data sharing.
- Landowner/informal user consent is required for plot establishment; long-term institutional support is encouraged for sustainability.
- Data ownership, authorship, acknowledgments, and protocol references are clearly defined to enable proper data provenance.

## Data collection standards and plot design

- Plot design: locate in homogeneous soil types and land-use histories; random or pre-determined stratified placement to avoid bias.
- Plot size and shape: 0.25–1.0 ha plots recommended for long-term monitoring; long-term plots often 1.0 ha square; circles, squares, or rectangles may be used.
- Location and orientation: record bearings, coordinates (latitude/longitude), elevation; account for slope to allow comparison with planar-area plots.
- Plot markings: permanent corners or centers marked with durable materials (concrete, steel, or cryptic marking where needed); plan for relocation during re-measurements.
- Timing: re-measure approximately every 5 years, with more frequent checks early on; measure at similar times of year to minimize seasonal diameter variation.
- Data recording: complete a plot data sheet for each plot (meta-data) detailing design, location, sampling, environmental conditions, land use, fire history, herbivore exposure, etc.

## Data collection standards for trees and stems

- All stems meeting inclusion criteria (base inside plot and minimum diameter threshold, including dead/fallen stems) should be tagged, measured, and identified.
- Diameter measurements: use a defined point of measurement (POM) at 1.3 m or 0.3 m from ground; default to 1.3 m unless insufficient stems reach that height.
- POM guidance: adjust for slope, leaning, deformities, buttresses, forks, and climbers; record exact POM height and any adjustments.
- Diameter measurement methods: use a diameter tape for ≥5 cm DBH; calipers for smaller stems; half-diameter methods permitted when full circumnavigation is not possible.
- Multiple stems: record base ID and assign unique stem IDs to all stems; determine whether stems belong to the same tree.
- Marking stems: use metal tags or painted numbers; tags placed 20 cm above POM to aid remeasurement; consider cryptic marking if tagging affects plot use.
- Mapping stem location: record stem coordinates within the plot (often via a 10 m grid) to aid re-locating stems; GPS can be used with appropriate accuracy.
- Additional stem data: record species (with vouchers when possible), alive/dead status, cause of death, presence of decay, damage, resprouts, and whether stems are standing or fallen; document spatial position, height (optional), and whether stems are on termite mounds.
- Notable codes: use standardized categories for topkill, mortality modes, decay classes, and other qualitative assessments (e.g., U, P, S, W, Q for causes of death; decay class 1–5).

## Data management, documentation, and quality assurance

- Separate data sheets: live stems, topkilled stems, recruits, and stumps are recorded on separate sheets to support demographic analyses.
- Plot metadata: maintain a comprehensive plot data sheet with design, location, sampling, environmental conditions, land use history, and other contextual factors.
- Data structure: organize data so that every row is a record and every column is a variable to facilitate data cleaning and analysis.
- Remeasurement workflow: keep prior census data accessible on re-surveys; insert blank rows under each prior stem to preserve longitudinal records; ensure tag numbers are never reused.
- Recruitment and mortality tracking: tag recruits, record base IDs for resprouting analyses, and document mortality/topkill across censuses; remove stems only after two consecutive dead confirmations.
- Data integrity practices: relocate POMs if necessary, document any changes, and note explanations for significant diameter changes between censuses.
- Documentation of protocols: specify the protocol used (e.g., SEOSAW protocol) and provide references; maintain annexed data sheets for transparency and replication.

## Data standards for related data (biomass, species, and ancillary measures)

- Biomass and allometry: record species and use standardized allometries; collect vouchers when possible; document local or preferred allometry for biomass estimation.
- Species identification: involve a botanist or morphospecies approach; collect vouchers and consider photos of living, pressed, and flowering/fruiting material to aid later identification.
- Height and regeneration: height is optional but encouraged via site-specific height-diameter relationships or direct measurement for a subsample; include separate protocols for small stems (poles, saplings, seedlings) in regeneration studies.
- Coarse woody debris and stumps: define and measure woody debris and stumps with standardized criteria and decay assessments; apply biomass estimation methods for debris per standardized equations.
- Stumps and damages: record diameter, height, decay, species (if possible), and cause of break; distinguish between topkill and mortality.

## Data sharing, interoperability, and practical tools

- SEOSAW data and field forms: the manual is complemented by Android data-entry forms (Open Data Kit) and Excel sheets to promote standardized data capture and sharing.
- Global interoperability: designed to align with global networks (e.g., RAINFOR) to enable cross-site comparisons and integration into broader carbon and biodiversity analyses.
- Practical tools and technologies: use GIS for plot randomization and location planning; drone-assisted site assessment; photogrammetry software (Pix4D, Metashape) for post-processing; standard GPS devices for coordinates.
- Data accessibility: data sheets and protocols are published to support reuse; documentation and annexes provide structure for data collection and archival.

## Particular challenges for Data Stewards

- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities.
- Timely receipt of data from multiple data producers.
- Ensuring data creators meet standards and metadata requirements.
- Managing data across diverse systems and formats, including non-interoperable legacy datasets.
- Handling large datasets and transfer limitations.
- Dealing with outdated databases requiring bespoke solutions and careful integration.
