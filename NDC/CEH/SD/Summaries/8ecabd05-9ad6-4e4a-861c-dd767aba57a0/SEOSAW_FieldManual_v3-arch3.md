# SEOSAW Field Manual

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a standardized method for establishing long-term, large plots (savannas, woodlands, forests) focused on environmental health monitoring and policy-relevant metrics.
  - Aims to enable cross-site comparability and integration into global comparisons; complementary data-entry tools (Android/ODK, Excel) available via the SEOSAW website.

- Core monitoring design for policymakers and managers
  - Plot placement and consent
    - Locate plots in homogeneous soil types and land-use histories; obtain informed consent from landowners and users.
    - Random or pre-determined pattern placement within strata to avoid bias; regular spacing can aid certain analyses.
  - Plot size and shape
    - Long-term monitoring: 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 ha; 1.0 ha square plots preferred; circular plots usable but larger circles are harder to measure beyond ~20 m radius.
    - Shape choices (square preferred for perimeter efficiency; circles for quick setup); record bearings and position.
  - Data scope and cadence
    - Measure stems above a defined minimum diameter threshold (commonly 5 or 10 cm) at 1.3 m or 0.3 m height.
    - Re-measure approximately every 5 years, with more frequent visits early on to resolve census errors.
    - Complete a plot data sheet for each plot to support diverse analyses.

- What to measure (tree stems and accompanying data)
  - All stems meeting inclusion criteria (live, dead, standing or fallen) within plots; not restricted to “trees” as defined botanically.
  - Key stem attributes and recommendations
    - Tag ID/stem ID; record all stems that meet inclusion criteria.
    - Diameter and Point of Measurement (POM): standard height (1.3 m or 0.3 m); use diameter tapes for ≥5 cm, calipers for smaller stems; note POM height and adjust if necessary.
    - Species identification (prefer botanist/parataxonomist; collect vouchers when possible).
    - Alive/Dead status and cause of death; include topkill, resprouting, and decay classification; record whether stem is standing or fallen; note damages, cambial exposure, bracket fungus.
    - Spatial position (optional): record X/Y coordinates or grid-based positions to support spatial analyses; use GPS where appropriate.
    - Height (optional): useful for biomass allometry and allometric checks; measure on a subset if full height measurement is impractical.
    - New recruits: track stems reaching the minimum diameter threshold for recruitment analysis; record with dedicated recruit sheet and assign unique tag IDs that are never reused.
    - Stumps and coarse woody debris: document stumps above POM and measure debris density/biomass via standard methods at plot level.
  - Subplots for regeneration and understory (optional)
    - Small stems, saplings, poles, and seedlings can be sampled in subplots (e.g., 2 m wide x 50 m long transects) to assess regeneration and understory diversity.

- Plot establishment and marking
  - Location and site criteria
    - Homogeneous soil and land-use history; informed consent; access considerations; long-term institutional support; consider human disturbance and potential changes in land use.
  - Marking and locating plots
    - Use durable markers (e.g., concrete posts, steel droppers, or similar) to ensure re-location; cryptic options available where marking biases the plot usage.
    - In circular plots, mark center or corners; for squares/rectangles, mark corners; maintain plot markers to withstand environmental conditions.
  - Orientation and slope considerations
    - Record main axes bearings; adjust planning to account for slope so that plots sample a defined surface area rather than a flat plane; compute planar area later using slope/aspect data.
  - Plot boundary stringing
    - Use at least two people to lay out boundaries with string; minimize vegetation disturbance; place additional internal strings (e.g., 10–20 m spacing) to aid orientation and mapping.

- Data recording, governance, and metadata
  - Meta data collection
    - Record plot design, location (lat/long, altitude, slope, aspect), sampling within plot, environmental conditions, land-use rights, fire regime, canopy cover, termite presence, and herbivore exposure.
    - Include information on land ownership, rights for harvesting, and any management or manipulation experiments.
  - Data sheets and templates
    - Use SEOSAW plot data sheet for plot-level meta data; separate data sheets for stems, recruits, stumps, and coarse woody debris; annexed data sheets are provided for standardized data capture.
  - Data sharing and openness
    - Protocol emphasises transparency, openness, and standardized data governance to facilitate reuse and cross-site comparisons; aims to share underlying data where appropriate.

- Re-measurement and long-term data integrity
  - Re-measurement cadence and process
    - Re-measure stems approximately every 5 years; re-measurement should reuse previous census data to check for errors.
    - Insert blank rows for new censuses under each originally measured stem record to maintain consistent data structure.
  - Demographic processes
    - Track recruitment, resprouting, topkill, and mortality with dedicated tags and base IDs to preserve lineage.
    - Do not reuse tag numbers; maintain base IDs for stems with multiple parts; if all stems die, decide on whether to keep or remove bases and ensure consistent tagging strategy.
  - Relocation and POM adjustments
    - Re-identify stems by relocating POM relative to tags; if POM degrades, record measurements at old and new POM to adjust biomass estimates.

- Data types and analyses supported
  - Biomass estimation
    - Use diameter, species-specific allometry, and possible wood density data; height data optional but beneficial for certain allometries.
  - Population dynamics
    - Assess recruitment, mortality, resprouting, and topkill dynamics to inform carbon balance and ecological processes.
  - Biodiversity and habitat structure
    - Capture species identifications, habitat structure (canopy cover, termite mounds), and spatial patterns.
  - Coarse woody debris and stumps
    - Quantify deadwood densities, volumes, and decay classes for carbon and fuelwood assessments.
  - Understory and regeneration (optional)
    - Include saplings, poles, and seedlings within small transects for regeneration studies and understory diversity.

- Tools and technology
  - Data collection devices
    - Android tablets with open data kit (ODK) forms; Excel-based data entry sheets; cloud or local data storage as appropriate.
  - Positioning and imagery
    - GPS for coordinates; drones can assist in site assessment, boundary validation, and large-area verification; post-processing can create large-area mosaics for analysis.
  - Measurement tools
    - Diameter tapes for ≥5 cm diameters; calipers for smaller stems; seismically robust tagging, with 20 cm above POM tagging to facilitate remeasurement.

- Annexes and templates
  - Annex 1: Plot data sheet (plot-level metadata)
  - Annex 2: Stem data sheet (individual stem records)
  - Appendix references for data collection, species vouchers, and measurement protocols

- Practical considerations for policy-oriented monitoring frameworks
  - Standardization and comparability
    - The manual provides a consistent protocol for plot establishment, measurement, and data recording to enable cross-site policy-relevant analyses and benchmarking.
  - Data quality and metadata
    - Emphasizes robust metadata, plain-language documentation, and rigorous data management to support governance and auditing of environmental health indicators.
  - Open data and governance
    - Encourages sharing of datasets and methodological transparency to reduce data silos and support evidence-based decision-making.
  - Stakeholder engagement and legitimacy
    - Requires landowner consent, community engagement, and consideration of land-use rights to ensure sustainable, policy-relevant monitoring programs.

- Key takeaway for monitoring framework authors
  - Adopt a standardized, transparent, and repeatable field protocol that aligns plot design, measurement, and data governance with long-term environmental health objectives.
  - Ensure data collection supports biomass, biodiversity, and ecosystem process indicators while enabling re-measurement to track temporal changes.
  - Build in data sheets, metadata capture, and governance processes from the outset to facilitate policy evaluation, cross-site comparisons, and open-data collaboration.
