SEOSAW Field Manual

Summary
- Describes a method for establishing long-term plots across savannas, woodlands, and forests in southern Africa to enable cross-site data comparability and integration with global datasets.
- Emphasizes capturing standardized, rich plot- and stem-level data to support biomass estimation, species diversity, recruitment, mortality, and demographic processes.
- Provides practical guidance on plot design, data collection, measurement protocols, data recording, and re-measurement to ensure data quality and long-term usability.
- Encourages use of Android data entry with SEOSAW data sheets and Excel sheets, plus GIS, and, where helpful, drones for site suitability.
- Contains detailed protocols for marking, measuring, tagging, recording, and re-measuring stems, as well as handling of small stems, stumps, coarse woody debris, termites, and associated metadata.

Key Data Framework and Rationale
- Standardization: Aims for compatibility across SEOSAW partners and global comparisons; follows shared data sheets and protocols.
- Metadata emphasis: Comprehensive plot metadata (design, location, sampling, environmental conditions, land use, fire history, large herbivore presence) to support robust analyses.
- Reproducibility: Clear procedures for re-measurement, data sheet organization (one row per record; separate recruit sheets), and tag management to minimize data losses and errors.

Plot Design and Setup (Data Perspective)
- Location and homogeneity: Select plots in homogeneous soil, land-use history, and ensure landowner consent; randomize plot placement within strata to avoid bias.
- Plot size and shape: Long-term goals favor 1.0 ha square plots; 0.25–1.0 ha options available; circular, square, or rectangular shapes with square preferred for boundary efficiency; document axes, coordinates, slope, and altitude.
- Accessibility and longevity: Ensure long-term institutional support; avoid sites prone to permanent disturbance; consider random placement using GIS-generated points with reserved backups.
- Slope adjustment: Record slope/aspect to compute planar area for cross-site comparability; adjust bearings to fit homogenous strata.

Plot Geometry and Timing
- Shape/orientation: Use North-South and East-West axes when possible; record start-point bearings, latitude, longitude, and elevation.
- Size and sampling intensity: Larger plots reduce perimeter effects; ensure a minimum of about 200 trees measured per plot by selecting appropriate minimum diameter thresholds.
- Timing: Schedule measurements for consistent seasonal conditions to minimize diameter measurement variation; dry season often preferred.

Plot Marking and Visibility
- Relocation markers: Permanently mark plot corners/centre (or cryptic alternatives where visibility biases are problematic); use durable materials (concrete posts, steel droppers, or buried markers) to withstand field conditions.
- Plot visibility considerations: If visibility biases are present, avoid conspicuous markers and rely on maps/tloating markers to relocate plots.
- Marker and data integrity: Use 20 cm offset between marker and POM for re-measurement reliability; consider differential GPS where appropriate.

Data Recording and Plot Metadata
- Plot data sheets: Record a complete set of metadata for every plot (design, location, sampling, environmental conditions, land use, fire history, herbivore exposure, etc.) on SEOSAW plot data sheets.
- Annexed templates: Use provided plot data sheets and associated data collection annexes for consistency and future analyses.

What to Measure (Stem- and Plot-level Data)
- Scope: Tag, measure, and identify all stems meeting inclusion criteria (≥ minimum diameter threshold; base ≥ 50% inside plot), including alive or dead, standing or fallen, climbers, palms, and baobabs.
- Diameter and POM: Measure stem diameter at a defined point of measurement (POM = 1.3 m default, or 0.3 m if necessary); record POM height and any adjustments (deformities, buttresses, forks, leaning).
- Multiple stems and base IDs: For multi-stemmed individuals, assign a base ID and unique stem IDs; record the base ID for stems connected to the same tree.
- Marking stems: Tag stems with metal tags or painted numbers; place tags 20 cm above POM; consider cryptic marking if tagging affects plot use.
- Mapping: Record precise stem locations (x, y) within the plot, using a 10 m strip grid if needed; alternatively, use GPS with adequate accuracy for larger plots.
- Alive/Dead and topkill: Mark status as alive or topkilled; use standardized codes for cause of death and decay; record signs of resprouting or mortality.
- Crown and health indicators: Note cambial exposure, bracket fungus, and overall health indicators to inform mortality and biomass estimates.
- Height data: Height is optional; if possible, develop site-specific height–diameter relationships using a sub-sample to estimate heights for other stems.
- Special cases: Note stems on termite mounds; record climbers and epiphytes; address buttressed or fluted stems with POM adjustments as needed.
- Data sheets: Use separate data sheets for live stems, topkilled stems, recruits, and stumps to streamline analysis.

Diameter Measurement Details
- Tools: Diameter tapes for ≥5 cm; calipers for smaller stems; measure to 0.1 cm precision.
- Deformities and special cases: If POM is deformed, move diameter measurement up or down per guidelines; use half-diameter methods when full wrap is not possible (and document).
- Large trees: Flag stems >10x the threshold with a note to reduce data entry errors.

Marking and Mapping Details
- Tags: Use durable metal tags or painted markers; ensure nails allow growth; consider non-reflective or painted finishes for animal disturbance.
- Base and stem IDs: Maintain a consistent tagging scheme; never reuse tags for the same plot; the base ID ties stems to the same tree across censuses.
- Mapping strategy: Use 10 m strip-based coordinates to locate stems; record center coordinates for circular plots.

Stems in Special States
- Cut/broken/fallen: Record the height of cut/break, cambial exposure, bracket fungus, or status as fallen; exclude non-rooted stems from the stem inventory and treat as woody debris if appropriate.
- Stumps: Record diameter at top, height, diameter at 0.3 m above base, decay class, species, and cause of break; no need to tag stumps.

Alive/Dead and Topkill Codes
- Alive/Dead: Tag and track stem status; a stem is topkilled if there is no sap beneath the bark at the POM and no canopy signs; record cause of death and decay class using standardized codes.
- Topkill codes: Include modality (U, P, S, W, etc.) and cause (N, E, F, H, M, etc.); when cause is human, provide method details in notes.

Species Identification
- Identification process: Involve a botanist or parataxonomist; collect vouchers when possible; use morphospecies when necessary; ensure voucher handling complies with Nagoya protocol.
- Documentation: Photograph living leaves, fruits, flowers, bark; preserve dried herbarium specimens when possible; recordings and permissions are essential for international exchanges.

Height Measurement
- Methods: Direct measurement or height estimation via site-specific diameter–height relationships; use trigonometric methods or sight-based estimation where necessary.
- Data integration: Height data should be collected for stems meeting the diameter threshold and can be used to improve biomass estimates.

Coarse Woody Debris and Other Components
- Coarse woody debris: Define and measure using perpendicular transects across the plot; record diameter at intersection, piece length, and decay class; estimate density, volume, and biomass using standard equations.
- Termites: Note presence of termite mounds for diversity analyses.

Data Recording and Census Routines
- Data sheets: Maintain separate sheets for live stems, topkilled stems, recruits, stumps, and other components; ensure consistency with SEOSAW templates.
- Plot re-measurement: Re-measure approximately every 5 years, with an initial period of more frequent checks; consult previous census data to maintain continuity.
- Data integrity: Insert blank rows for each previously measured stem to preserve lineage; recruit data should be on a separate recruit sheet; never reuse tag numbers; record base IDs for recruits to track resprouting.
- Missing trees: Investigate missing stems to distinguish topkill from relocation errors; search for tag remnants or roots to confirm death.

Annexes and Templates

Tools and Practical Aids
- Digital data capture: Android data kit and Excel sheets for field data entry; MOUs and data handoffs to ensure consistency.
- GIS and remote sensing: Pre-field random placement of plots; use high-resolution imagery to assess land-use and disturbance indicators.
- Drone guidance: For site suitability and rapid assessments of potential plot locations; guidance on flight planning and post-processing software (Pix4D, Agisoft Metashape) for creating areal statistics.
- Allometry and biomass: Use site-appropriate allometric models; document recommended allometry and justifications within plot data.
