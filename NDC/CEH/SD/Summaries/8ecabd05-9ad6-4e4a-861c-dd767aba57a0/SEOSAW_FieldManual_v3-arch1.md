# SEOSAW Field Manual

- A field protocol for establishing and monitoring long-term plots in savannas, woodlands, and forests in southern Africa.
- Emphasizes compatibility and comparability with other networks (e.g., RAINFOR) and aims to share practical experience, including what works and what does not.
- Supports data entry via Android tablets (ODK) and Excel sheets; promotes standardized data sheets and metadata to enable cross-site analyses and global comparisons.

## Scope and aims
- Applicable to long-term large plots and useful for one-off smaller plots.
- Focus on documenting methods that balance practicality with cross-site comparability within SEOSAW and with global standards.
- Provide guidance on plot establishment, data collection, and re-measurement to support analyses of carbon, biomass, and biodiversity.

## Plot design and location (2.1)
- Locate plots on homogeneous soil and land-use histories; obtain informed consent from landowners and users.
- Recommended long-term plot sizes: 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 ha (1.0 ha squares preferred) for monitoring.
- Measure diameters of all stems above a chosen threshold (e.g., ≥5 or ≥10 cm) at 1.3 m or 0.3 m height.
- Establish permanent plot markers at corners (or centre for circular plots) using durable materials (e.g., concrete posts, iron bars).
- Re-measure roughly every 5 years; more frequent measurements early on.
- Complete a plot data sheet for every plot.

## Plot location and randomization (4.1)
- Criteria for site selection: homogeneous soil and land-use history; informed consent; good access; long-term institutional support; low risk of permanent land-use change.
- Avoid bias by random placement within strata; use GIS to generate random points and select odd-numbered points as actual locations; keep extra reserved points.
- Tools: GIS software, high-resolution imagery on tablets; drones can help assess suitability and disturbance.

## Shape and orientation (4.2)
- Plot shapes: circles, squares, and rectangles; squares preferred when possible due to lower perimeter-to-area ratio.
- Align principal axes roughly NS/EW; record bearings, latitude, longitude, and elevation.
- Account for slope so plots sample an area rather than a plane; record average slope, aspect, and corner altitudes to allow planar area corrections later.

## Size and scaling (4.3)
- Plot size impacts perimeter ratio and biomass estimate distributions.
- 1 ha is standard for SEOSAW long-term plots; smaller plots (0.75, 0.5, 0.25 ha) acceptable where vegetation is homogeneous and dense.
- Plots with fewer than ~25 stems inside are not ideal for diversity estimates; consider increasing size.

## Timing (4.4)
- Time measurements to minimize water-content-driven diameter variation; dry season often preferred for stem measurements and understory clarity; rainy season beneficial for voucher collection and flowering/fruiting for identification.

## Visibility and markers (4.5)
- Mark plot corners or centre for long-term relocation; in some areas, cryptic markers or buried maps may be used to avoid bias.
- Use durable markers (e.g., treated posts, steel droppers, concrete posts) and consider cryptic markers where visibility biases must be avoided.
- If using GPS-only markers, be aware of relocation accuracy; differential GPS is more precise but ties users to expensive equipment.

## Plot boundaries and stringing (4.6)
- After establishing the start point, lay out plot boundaries with at least two people, minimizing vegetation disturbance.
- Consider adding strings along the plot length at regular spacing to aid orientation and mapping.

## Data recording and metadata (4.7)
- Record comprehensive plot metadata using the SEOSAW plot data sheet ( Annex/Appendix ).
- Metadata topics include plot design, location, sampling, environmental conditions, land use history, fire history, herbivore exposure, and other contextual factors.

## What to measure: stems, recruitment, and all stems (5.1)
- Tag, measure, and identify all stems that meet inclusion criteria (more than 50% base inside plot and above a minimum diameter threshold, typically 5 or 10 cm).
- Include live, dead, standing, and fallen stems (as long as contiguous from base to measurement point).
- For recruitment, record all stems below the main threshold; select threshold to ensure at least ~200 trees measured per plot.
- Optional sub-sections cover poles, saplings, and seedlings for regeneration studies.

## Point of measurement and diameter (5.2)
- Use a defined POM (1.3 m default; 0.3 m if few stems reach 1.3 m).
- Record exact POM for every stem; adjust POM if needed due to deformities, forks, buttresses, or lean.
- If necessary, measure at multiple POMs (e.g., 1.3 m and 0.3 m) to enable cross-site comparisons using a conversion factor.
- For special cases (forked, buttressed, buttress roots, climbers), specify measurement adjustments and locations.
- Make diameter measurements with diameter tape (≥5 cm) or calipers for smaller stems; record to the nearest 0.1 cm.
- For complex cases (climbers, deformations), use half-diameter methods and note in the data form.

## Multiple stems and base IDs (5.2.3)
- Record base IDs for stems that belong to the same tree; ensure each stem has a unique stem ID.
- For trees with multiple stems, the base ID is the first tagged stem’s ID, maintained even if later stems die.

## Marking and mapping stems (5.3)
- Attach metal tags or painted numbers to stems; place tag about 20 cm above the POM to aid relocation without affecting measurements.
- If tagging affects plot use, bury the tag at the base as an alternative.
- Map stem locations, ideally via a 10 m grid within the plot; for circular plots, record distance and bearing from the center. Differential GPS can be used if available, but standard GPS is less precise.

## Stem condition and mapping details (5.4–5.5)
- 5.4: Record if a stem was cut, broken, damaged (with cambial exposure and bracket fungus), or fallen.
- If a stem is not rooted in soil, it is not part of the stem inventory and is categorized as woody debris.
- 5.5: Record alive vs. dead/topkilled status; topkilled indicates no sap beneath bark at POM and no canopy life; note cause and decay class where applicable.

## Topkill codes and decay classes (5.5.1)
- Use codes to describe death mode and cause (Uprooted, Snapped, Standing, Vanished, etc.; Human, Fire, Elephant, Termites, Wind, Neighbouring tree, etc.).
- Decay classes describe wood condition and biomass reduction (structured codes from sound/firm to highly decayed; many descriptive attributes).

## Species identification and vouchers (5.6)
- Assign species or morphospecies to each stem; involve a botanist/parataxonomist during plot setup.
- Collect voucher specimens when possible; store duplicates in herbaria; pursue legal export permissions per Nagoya protocol.
- Use photos (living and herbarium-like) to aid later verification.

## Height measurement (5.7)
- Height measurement is time-consuming; develop site-specific height–diameter relationships from a subsample (approx. 50 trees across DBH ranges).
- If r-squared < 0.5 for height predictions, measure heights for more stems.
- Height should be recorded for separate stems meeting the diameter threshold.

## Stems on termite mounds (5.8)
- Note stems located on termite mounds, as mounds support distinct flora and may influence analyses of diversity.

## Data recording practices (5.9)
- Use separate data sheets for live stems, topkilled stems, recruits, and stumps.
- Ensure data sheets facilitate retrospective re-measurement and data cleaning.

## Small stems (6)
- Define small-stem classes: poles (5–10 cm DBH), saplings (diameter at 0.1 m height <5 cm), and seedlings (<3 mm at 0.1 m height but ≥0).
- Use a 2 m x 50 m transect in two subplots per 0.25 ha to count small stems; optional additional measures for understory.
- Tagging of very small stems is discouraged if it causes damage; measurements may be limited to counts.

## Stumps (7)
- Record stumps (>5 cm at top) and use separate sheets for stumps and cut stems.
- Capture diameter at the top, height, diameter at 0.3 m above base, decay class, species, and cause of break.

## Coarse woody debris (8)
- Define and quantify dead, non-rooted woody material lying on or above the ground (not including stumps or rooted trees).
- Use an X or + transect layout radiating from the plot center to avoid sampling bias.
- Record diameter at intersection, piece length, decay class, and species; apply Waddell-based biomass equations to estimate density, volume, and biomass per plot.

## Plot re-measurement (9)
- Re-measure stems roughly every 5 years; review previous census data for consistency.
- Keep prior census data on the new datasheet for consistency; use recruit sheets for new stems.
- Tag all stems if possible; track bases to study resprouting and mortality dynamics; never reuse tag numbers.
- If stems die, recheck dead status in subsequent censuses to confirm mortality; remove stems only after two confirmed dead censuses.

## Annexes
- Annex 1: Plot data sheet (plot-level metadata: design, location, sampling, environment, land use, fire, herbivores, etc.).
- Annex 2: Stem data sheet (per-stem records including POM, DBH, alive/dead, stand/fall, mode, cause, decay, height of break, notes).

- Overall, the SEOSAW Field Manual provides a comprehensive, standardized protocol for establishing, maintaining, and re-measuring long-term woody plots, with explicit methods for data collection, tagging, measurement, and metadata to enable robust analyses of biomass, diversity, and demographic processes across southern Africa.
