# 25m raster

- What it is
  - The 25m raster dataset records the dominant land cover per 25m grid cell, derived from converting land parcels within the vector dataset into a 25m grid using LCM2000 Subclasses.
- Metadata (Great Britain and Northern Ireland)
  - Great Britain: 24,400 columns × 48,400 rows; lower left easting 50,000 m; lower left northing 10,000 m; pixel size 25 m; coordinate system British National Grid; projection Transverse Mercator; Spheroid Airy; Datum OSGB 1936.
  - Northern Ireland: 7,600 columns × 7,200 rows; lower left easting 180,000 m; lower left northing 280,000 m; pixel size 25 m; coordinate system Irish National Grid; projection Transverse Mercator; Spheroid Airy Modified 1849; Datum Ireland 1965.
  - Note: For pixel centre, add 12.5 m to each lower-left value.
- 1km raster (summary of 25m data)
  - The LCM2000 raster 1km data is created by summarising the 25m data within 1km grid cells.
  - Great Britain: 700 columns × 1,300 rows; lower left easting/northing 0; pixel size 1,000 m.
  - Northern Ireland: 500 columns × 500 rows; lower left easting/northing 0; pixel size 1,000 m.
  - Coordinate system, projection, spheroid, and datum mirror the 25m dataset (GB OSGB36; NI Ireland 1965; Transverse Mercator; Airy/Airy Modified 1849).
  - Note: For pixel centre, add 500 m to each lower-left value.
- Coding and storage details
  - 25m Subclass codes (normally floating point with one decimal place) are stored as 8-bit unsigned bytes by multiplying by 10 (0–255 range).
  - Example: Water (inland) Subclass 22.1 → 221 in the raster dataset.
- Table 3: Subclass-to-1km-to-aggregate mapping
  - Provides the correspondence between 25m Subclass codes, 1km codes, and Aggregate class codes for each land cover type.

- Practical implications for analysts
  - Enables cross-scale analysis by providing a direct mapping between 25m land-cover subclasses and 1km aggregate classes.
  - Facilitates area estimation and change detection at two resolutions, with consistent coding schemes across Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
  - The byte-encoded 25m subclass codes allow compact storage and straightforward reclassification to standard categories at 1km or other analytic levels.
- Key considerations
  - Pixel centre offsets and differing coordinate extents between GB and NI must be accounted for in spatial joins and alignment.
  - The mapping table (Table 3) is essential for interpreting codes and performing accurate cross-scale analyses.
