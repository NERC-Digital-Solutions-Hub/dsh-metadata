# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Purpose
  - Map Broad Habitats to LCM2000 Target Class, Subclass, and Variant structure to understand how land-cover classes align with field-survey habitat categories.
  - Provide a framework for comparing map-derived classes with field-derived classifications.

- Structure of LCM2000 classifications (as used in the tables)
  - Target Class: the broad category (e.g., Sea/Estuary, Water inland, Littoral rock, Supralittoral rock, etc.).
  - Subclasses: more detailed groupings within each Target Class.
  - Variants: further refinements within Subclasses.
  - The mapping often shows multiple correspondences (e.g., Broad Habitats linking to several LCM2000 Subclasses/Variants).

- Data coverage and examples
  - Table 5 presents the coverage (in km2) of LCM2000 Subclasses and of Aggregate classes (bold) from LCM2000 and from field survey (FS) in the UK and its constituent countries.
  - Major patterns include:
    - England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland totals for broad land-cover types (e.g., Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing open water, Built-up areas, etc.).
    - UK totals (LCM2000) vs. FS totals where FS data is available.
  - Coastal coverage is noted as variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore inter-tidal areas.
  - FS statistics differ in definition (e.g., FS population of 1 km squares) which affects total coverage and comparability.

- Key findings (Table 6 and related notes)
  - Table 6 compares LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) with field-survey (FS) estimates at 95% confidence intervals (Low/High) for GB and its regions.
  - General pattern:
    - There is variation in how closely FS estimates align with LCM2000 figures across habitat types and regions.
    - Some categories show FS estimates bracketed by or close to LCM2000 values; others show notable differences, reflecting landscape/scale and definitional differences.
  - Important methodological notes:
    - LCM2000 statistics come from a full count of cover using a 25 m grid.
    - FS statistics follow methods from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
    - Differences between LCM2000 and FS statistics are explained in the text.
  - Coastal coverage caveat: Coastal areas are variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore areas.

- Summary correspondences (Tables 8–10)
  - Tables 8–10 present summary correspondence matrices comparing LCM2000 data with CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain (and England & Wales in Table 9; Scotland in Table 10).
  - Key aspects:
    - Results are expressed per 1000 (or per BH level) and are weighted estimates using strata based on 40 Land Classes, with bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals.
    - The matrices show how often a given CS2000 habitat category corresponds to a given LCM2000 target class, subclass, or variant.
    - Results are provided at different aggregation levels (Target Class, Aggregate Class) and include urban/generalisation considerations.
  - Overall pattern:
    - There is a range of correspondence strength across habitat types and regions; some LCM2000 categories align relatively well with CS2000 field classifications, while others show weaker or more ambiguous correspondences.
    - General caution is advised when interpreting direct one-to-one mappings due to scale and boundary differences and potential urban generalisation.

- Footnotes and methodological context
  - Footnotes explain:
    - LCM2000 and CS2000 as complementary data sources, with the former based on a 25 m grid and the latter on field survey squares.
    - Coarse-to-fine generalisation issues, especially in urban and coastal contexts.
    - Differences in definitions and population extents (e.g., NI exclusions in FS, 1 km squares definition).
    - Bootstrapping and stratification approach used to derive confidence in the correspondence matrices.
  - The tables emphasise that differences between LCM2000 and FS are expected and are discussed in the accompanying text.
