# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Purpose: Present how Broad Habitats map to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants (including Suclasses as displayed by map colours).
- Content scope: Defines mapping across multiple habitat types (e.g., inshore sublittoral, standing water, littoral rock/sediment, dune, urban, arable, woodland, bog, fen, moorland, etc.) to corresponding LCM2000 classifications.
- Output format: Sets up the framework for relating field observations and map classifications to Target Class, Subclass, and Variant levels for subsequent tables and analyses.

# Table 5. The coverage (km 2 ) of Subclasses from Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) and of Aggregate classes (bold)  from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) in the UK and constituent countries.

- What it shows:
  - Area coverage by LCM2000 Subclasses and Aggregate classes (in km2) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the UK.
  - Comparison between LCM2000 totals and field survey (FS) estimates where available.
- Key patterns:
  - Large totals for Arable & Horticultural, Improved Grassland, Suburban/Rural Developed, and Built-up Areas & Gardens across the UK.
  - Regional distribution varies by habitat type (e.g., substantial woodland when combining Broadleaved/mixed and Coniferous categories; substantial arable/forage areas in England & Wales; sizable mountain/habitat areas more concentrated in Scotland).
  - Some FS values are missing (n/a) for certain regions/habitat combinations, reflecting data gaps.
- Important notes:
  - LCM2000 statistics based on a full count of cover on a 25 m grid; FS statistics from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore inter-tidal areas.
  - Total coverage differs with the FS population definition (e.g., some BHs excluded in Northern Ireland).
- Practical takeaway for data use:
  - The table provides a comprehensive baseline of habitat extents by region, useful for cross-walking LCM2000 data to field observations and for planning data quality checks and calibrations.

# Table 6. LCM2000 cover (km 2 ) for BHs (uncalibrated) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and GB, compared with field survey estimates at 95% confidence (i.e. +/- 2 standard errors).

- What it shows:
  - Uncalibrated LCM2000 cover for Broad Habitats (BHs) by country/GB and corresponding Field Survey (FS) confidence ranges (Low and High) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and GB.
- Key examples:
  - Broadleaved/mixed and yew woodland: GB LCM2000 = 15,259; FS Low = 12,750; FS High = 16,670.
  - Coniferous woodland: GB LCM2000 = 12,879; FS Low = 10,672; FS High = 16,808.
  - Arable and horticulture: GB LCM2000 = 56,638; FS Low = 47,944; FS High = 57,036.
  - Improved grassland: GB LCM2000 = 50,024; FS Low = 50,536; FS High = 59,104.
  - Neutral grassland: GB LCM2000 = 10,770; FS Low = 5,046; FS High = 7,214.
  - Bog (peat/deep): GB LCM2000 = 5,134; FS Low = 18,696; FS High = 25,664.
- Important notes:
  - Data are uncalibrated; differences between LCM2000 and FS are explained in the text.
  - Coastal coverage and urban/generalisation considerations influence comparisons.
- Practical takeaway for data use:
  - The table illustrates substantial differences between map-based estimates and field survey ranges, highlighting the need for calibration and context-aware interpretation when using LCM2000 for decision-making.

# Table 8. Summary correspondences matrix (results expressed per 1000) made by from comparing LCM2000 with the CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain: results are weighted estimates, using strata based on 40 Land Classes, bootstrapped' to calculate confidence intervals (see text).

- What it provides:
  - A coarse, per-1000 correspondence matrix comparing LCM2000 Target Class and Aggregate Class levels against CS2000 field survey classifications.
  - Distinguishes broad habitats (yellow), urban generalisation (blue), and various class levels (pink/green) with bootstrapped confidence intervals.
- Key takeaways:
  - Indicates general alignment between LCM2000 and CS2000 across many habitat groups, but with notable discrepancies in several categories (differences in appearance, patchiness, and class definitions).
  - Urban/generalisation adjustments are considered in the comparisons.
  - The table supports understanding of where LCM2000 classifications map reliably to field survey squares and where calibration or local adjustment is needed.
- Practical takeaway for data use:
  - Useful for quality assessment and validation planning when aligning map-based data with survey data, and for prioritising areas needing local calibration.

# Table 9. Summary correspondences matrix (results expressed per 1000) made by from comparing LCM2000 with the CS2000 field survey squares in England and Wales: results are weighted estimates, using strata based on 40 Land Classes, bootstrapped' to calculate confidence intervals (see text).

- What it provides:
  - Similar to Table 8 but restricted to England and Wales.
- Key takeaways:
  - Provides region-specific alignment insights between LCM2000 classifications and CS2000 field data for England & Wales, with confidence intervals.
  - Highlights areas where LCM2000 over- or under-represents certain habitat types relative to field data.
- Practical takeaway for data use:
  - Enables targeted calibration and validation for the England/Wales subset, informing policy and planning decisions at these scales.

# Footnotes (general for Tables 5–10)

- Data sources and definitions:
  - LCM2000: full-cover grid-based statistics; CS2000/FS: field survey statistics (Haines-Young et al. 2000).
- Methodological notes:
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS explained in the text.
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and offshore area inclusion/exclusion.
  - FS population definitions influence total coverage (e.g., some BHs excluded in Northern Ireland).
- Data quality and interpretation:
  - Some FS values are missing (n/a); many results are uncalibrated (Table 6).
  - Bootstrapping used for confidence intervals in Tables 8–10 to provide uncertainty estimates.

Overall implications for Data Support perspective

- Data integration challenges:
  - Substantial differences between map-based (LCM2000) and field-based (CS2000/FS) data highlight calibration needs, especially for urban areas, coastal zones, and complex habitat categories.
- Data quality considerations:
  - Although LCM2000 offers comprehensive nationwide coverage at 25 m resolution, calibration against CS2000/FS is essential to ensure reliable decision-making, especially for policy and local planning contexts.
- Practical guidance for data supporters:
  - Use Table 5 and Table 6 to understand the scale and variability of habitat extents by region and habitat type, with attention to uncalibrated nature and confidence ranges.
  - Employ Tables 8–10 as a basis for validating LCM2000 classifications against field survey data; identify habitats requiring local calibration or refinement.
  - Factor coastal variability and data gaps (FS n/a) into analyses and reporting, and communicate the uncertainty and assumptions clearly in data products.
