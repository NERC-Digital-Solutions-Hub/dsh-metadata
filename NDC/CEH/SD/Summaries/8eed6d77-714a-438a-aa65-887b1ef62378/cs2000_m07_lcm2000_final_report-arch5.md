# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents how Broad Habitats map to LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants.
  - Uses colour-coding to display Suclasses in map displays.
  - Establishes terminology and relationships used throughout the document (Target Class, Subclass, Variants).

- Data structure and classifications
  - LCM2000 structure comprises:
    - Target Class (e.g., Sea/Estuary, Water inland, Littoral rock, etc.)
    - Subclasses (more specific groupings within a Target Class)
    - Variants (specific forms within a Subclass, e.g., rock, mud, dune types)
  - Examples of mappings include broad habitats such as Broad-leaved woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & Horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing open water, Built-up areas, and various coastal/sea-related habitats.
  - The table shows how each LCM2000 category aligns with target classes, subclasses, and variants, enabling cross-referencing between classification schemes.

- Key datasets and sources referenced
  - LCM2000 (Land Cover Map 2000) with 25 m grid statistics
  - FS (Field Survey) data from Haines-Young et al. 2000 as a baseline for validation
  - CS2000 field survey squares used for comparative validation in Tables 8–10
  - Notes indicate differences between LCM2000 and field survey data, including coastal/urban coverage and data availability (n/a denotes not available)

- Regional coverage and totals (Table 5 focus)
  - Table 5 provides area (km2) by Subclass from LCM2000 and by Aggregate classes (bold) from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) across England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and UK totals.
  - Examples of many entries include: Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable cereals, Arable & Horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing water, Built-up areas, and Coastal categories.
  - Overall UK totals show large-scale coverage differences between LCM2000 and FS estimates; coastal coverage is highlighted as variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of inter-tidal areas.
  - Some regions/cells report FS data as not available (n/a) or partial coverage, reflecting data availability and definitional choices.

- Validation and calibration (Table 6 emphasis)
  - Table 6 presents LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) for Broad Habitats (BHs) with field survey confidence intervals (CS2000 FS estimates Low/High) by England, Wales, Scotland, NI, GB totals.
  - Demonstrates the need for calibration of map-based estimates against field-derived data and shows regional variation in agreement and estimated ranges.

- Summary correspondence (Tables 8–10)
  - Tables 8–10 provide summary correspondence matrices comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares in GB, England & Wales, and Scotland, respectively.
  - Results are expressed per 1000 (weighted estimates) and show:
    - Correspondence for Broad Habitats (yellow), urban-generalisation considerations (blue), Target Class (pink), and Aggregate levels (green).
  - The matrices reveal varying levels of agreement across habitat categories, with notable effects of urban generalisation and coastal contexts on correspondence.

- Footnotes and methodological caveats
  - LCM2000 statistics are full counts on a 25 m grid; FS statistics come from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS are explained within the text; coastal and urban areas influence totals.
  - Definitions of BHs, targets, and variants may differ between datasets, affecting cross-walks and correspondence results.
  - Some data points are marked as n/a or include ranges to reflect uncertainty or unavailable data.

- Implications for data governance and action items for Data Stewards
  - Data lineage and provenance: track LCM2000 classifications, field survey inputs (CS2000/FS), and cross-walks used for mapping Target Class/Subclass/Variant.
  - Metadata and documentation: maintain clear definitions for Target Class, Subclass, Variant, and Suclass mappings; document any definitional differences across datasets.
  - Calibration and uncertainty: incorporate calibration results (Tables 6 and 8–10) and provide confidence intervals; flag areas with high uncertainty (e.g., coastal/urban regions).
  - Data quality assurance: ensure consistent handling of missing data (n/a) and transparent reporting of regional data gaps.
  - Interoperability: align LCM2000 classifications with CS2000/FS frameworks to improve cross-dataset comparability; include crosswalks in metadata.
  - Accessibility and governance: provide easy access to breakdowns by country and aggregated UK totals; maintain versioning to reflect recalibrations or updates.
  - Usability for users: ensure classification schemes are clearly explained for data creators and data users, enabling usable datasets for mapping, planning, and environmental analysis.
