# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a crosswalk between Broad Habitats and LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants to enable standardized tagging and comparison of environmental types over time.
  - Indicates how each Broad Habitat maps to a LCM2000 Target Class, with further refinement via Subclasses and Variants (some variants shown by map colours).

- Key mappings (high-level picture)
  - Inshore and coastal/marine environments are linked to Sea/Estuary or Inland Water categories, e.g., inshore sublittoral aligns with Sea/Estuary; standing water/canals aligns with Water (inland); supra-/littoral elements map to coastal rock and sediment categories.
  - Terrestrial habitats are associated with forest/woodland classes, arable and horticultural systems, grassland families (improved, neutral, calcareous, acid), bracken, dwarf shrub heath, fen/marsh/swamp, bog, and various montane or inland rock/urban groupings.
  - Urban and built-up areas are represented with “Built up areas and gardens,” “Suburban/rural developed,” and related agglomerations, while coastal edge entities include supralittoral and littoral rock/sediment categories.
  - A broad set of 22 Broad Habitats are explicitly linked to corresponding LCM2000 targets, with numerous Subclasses and Variants enumerated to capture the diversity across the UK.

- Data coverage and comparison (Tables 5 and 6)
  - Table 5: Coverage (km2) by Subclass from Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) and Aggregate classes from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) across the UK and constituent countries.
    - Provides country-level totals for major habitat groups (e.g., broadleaved woodland, coniferous woodland, arable crops, improved grassland, neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, bracken, fen/marsh/swamp, bog, urban and built-up areas, coastal/shoreline, etc.).
    - Example scale: total UK LCM2000 coverage for major classes sums to hundreds of thousands of km2 (e.g., UK total LCM2000 cover for Arable & Horticultural, Improved Grassland, Built up areas, etc.), with FS (field survey) figures provided where available to enable comparison.
    - Highlights that coastal coverage and some urban classifications show definitional differences and varying inclusion of intertidal areas.
  - Table 6: LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) vs field survey estimates at 95% confidence (GB, i.e., ±2 standard errors) for key Broad Habitats.
    - Provides LCM2000 values alongside Low/High FS estimates for multiple habitat groups (e.g., Broadleaved/mixed/yew woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & Horticulture, Improved Grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing Open Water, Montane habitats, Inland rock, Built up areas, Supralittoral/Littoral categories, etc.).
    - Indicates whether LCM2000 values align with FS bounds or differ substantially in particular habitat types (differences explained by calibration, coastal measurement, and survey scope).

- Summary of correspondences with CS2000 field survey (Tables 8–10)
  - Tables 8–10 present summary correspondence matrices (results per 1000) comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain, England & Wales, and Scotland.
  - The matrices are weighted and bootstrapped to generate confidence intervals, with results shown at:
    - Broad Habitats level (yellow cells)
    - Field survey generalisation for urban areas (blue cells)
    - LCM2000 Target Class level (pink cells)
    - Aggregate class levels (green cells)
  - Overall interpretation
    - There is a mix of alignment and divergence across habitat groups, with some Broad Habitat categories showing relatively higher correspondence and others showing substantial differences.
    - The analysis notes that urban generalisation, multiple classification levels, and coastal measurement differences contribute to observed mismatches.
  - Footnotes and caveats
    - Differences in calibration between LCM2000 and CS2000, coastal area inclusion/exclusion, and use of a 25 m grid for LCM2000 statistics.
    - Some Northern Ireland (NI) areas are excluded or treated differently in FS counts.
    - Coastal coverage variability and the need to generalise urban areas in certain comparisons.

- Data quality, processing, and dissemination (Analysts’ perspective)
  - Data handling
    - Requires understanding of data sources, verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation to support standardised outputs (e.g., reports, maps, charts).
    - Emphasises storage and uploading of created datasets to appropriate portals to support reuse.
  - Outputs
    - Delivers consistent formats that enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Accessibility and value
    - One challenge is increasing the value of monitoring datasets by integrating them with other relevant data sources (avoiding “single-use” datasets).
    - Another challenge is enabling broader access to the underlying data used to create final outputs.

- Implications for monitoring practice (Analysts’ takeaways)
  - The crosswalk between Broad Habitats and LCM2000 targets supports standardized monitoring and temporal comparisons, essential for assessing environmental health and policy progress.
  - The comparative tables (FS vs LCM2000; CS2000 field surveys) reveal areas where land-cover maps align well with field evidence and areas needing refinement or recalibration, particularly for coastal, urban, montane, fen/marsh/swamp, bog, and some calcareous/acid grassland categories.
  - Use of these mappings and correspondences can guide data integration, reporting, and decision-making, while acknowledging the methodological differences that influence observed discrepancies.

- General context and caveats
  - The statistics derive from a full count of cover on a 25 m grid (LCM2000) with FS data from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
  - Coastal coverage varies with tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore intertidal zones.
  - Differences in population definitions (e.g., NI vs GB) influence totals and comparability.
  - The material underscores the importance of documenting assumptions and providing confidence intervals to support transparent interpretation of habitat mapping outcomes.
