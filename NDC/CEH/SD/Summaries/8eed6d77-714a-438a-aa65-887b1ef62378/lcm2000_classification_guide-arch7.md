# CSLCM/Final

- A UK CEH report describing the LCM2000 land cover mapping project, its Broad Habitat framework, and calibration against the CS2000 field survey to support biodiversity reporting and habitat statistics.

## Overview

- Purpose: Support UK Biodiversity Action Plan reporting by mapping Broad Habitats (BHs) and providing calibrated, regionally consistent statistics.
- LCM2000: Thematic classification of satellite spectral data, enhanced with external data for context; provides BHs, Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants for flexible reporting.
- CS2000 field survey: Detailed, ground-based data used to assess map accuracy and calibrate LCM2000 outputs to enable BH statistics comparable to field data.

## Data and Classification Framework

- Broad Habitats (BHs): High-level habitat types defined by JNCC; LCM2000 maps spectral data to BHs with accompanying Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants for finer distinctions.
- Classification hierarchy:
  - BH level: Broad habitat category (e.g., Broadleaved woodland, Bog, Neutral grassland).
  - Target classes and Subclasses: More detailed spectral/land-use distinctions.
  - Variants: Thematic components within Target classes (e.g., specific crops, grassland management).
- Nomenclature: BH names used for map displays; LCM2000 classes shown in bold; some areas use aggregated BHs for reporting to reflect mapping reliability at national/regional scales.
- Key mapping considerations:
  - Spectral/class read-across challenges between BHs and Target classes.
  - Some small features (<0.5 ha) are not captured by LCM2000’s minimum mapping unit (MMU).
  - Coastal and linear features treated as aggregates or omitted from certain BH-level analyses due to resolution and mapping scope.

## GIS Operation and Calibration Methodology

- Data and GIS workflow:
  - ARC/Info coverage files created for 569 CS2000 squares (1 km each) and equivalent LCM2000 sections.
  - Three main comparison tests per square: per-pixel, per-segment, and per-parcel.
  - Correspondences evaluated at multiple thematic levels: BH level, generalized urban, Target class, and Aggregate class.
- Calibration approach:
  - Inter-comparison rather than strict validation due to resolution and timing differences between field surveys (FS) and satellite data.
  - Bootstrapping used to derive 95% confidence limits for correspondence measures.
  - The goal is to calibrate LCM2000 outputs with FS to produce BH statistics comparable to field data across GB, England/Wales, and Scotland.

## Confidence Limits and Correlation

- Bootstrapped confidence estimates provided for all correspondence measures.
- Overall correspondence (GB) by level:
  - Per-pixel: ~54% (GB), ~60% (England/Wales), ~44% (Scotland)
  - Per-segment: ~58% (GB), ~64% (England/Wales), ~47% (Scotland)
  - Per-parcel: ~62% (GB), ~69% (England/Wales), ~48% (Scotland)
- Higher correspondence at Target class and parcel levels than BH level, reflecting classification and resolution differences.
- Fragmentation and resolution differences (25 m pixels vs field parcels ~0.04 ha) contribute to most mis-matches; segmentation and dominant-class approaches improve agreement over pixel-level comparisons.

## LCM2000 Assessments at Class Level

- Summary matrices generated by stratifying by National Land Class and weighting by extent; analyzed at BH, Target, and Aggregate levels.
- Notable class-level patterns:
  - Broadleaved/mixed woodland and Coniferous woodland: similar UK coverage, but direct FS agreement is lower due to small woodland patches being below LCM2000’s MMU.
  - Arable and horticultural land: LCM2000 slightly higher than FS; confusion with improved grassland and general rotation effects in different survey years.
  - Improved grassland: well-classified by LCM2000; distinguishing it from semi-natural grasslands remains challenging; around 20% FS-improved grassland mapped as semi-natural by LCM2000.
  - Semi-natural grasslands, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands: difficult separation by spectral means; spectral masks struggle with pH-based distinctions and management effects.
  - Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog: significant mapping challenges due to habitat definitions, peat depth considerations, and spectral similarity; peat depth used to separate bog from heath, with noted discrepancies.
  - Montane habitats and Inland bare ground: limited field data and accessibility lead to larger uncertainties; altitude-based classification for montane habitats may not align well with FS.
  - Coastal BHs (Supra-littoral/Littoral): small, often below resolution; treated as aggregates for reporting; intertidal areas can be inconsistently represented.
  - Built up areas and gardens: LCM2000 differentiates Suburban/rural development and Continuous urban, whereas FS tends to treat urban land as a larger, continuous category with fewer distinctions for open spaces.
- Overall conclusion: LCM2000 captures broad patterns well but has notable disparities with FS due to resolution, MMU, timing, and classification differences. Certain BH distinctions (e.g., rough grasslands, peat-related bog vs heath) may improve with integrated analysis.

## LCM2000 Accuracy

- The reported correspondence is not ground truth accuracy; FS is not a perfect reference due to resolution and timing differences.
- Target-class level accuracy is more reliable than BH-level due to the aggregation of features and classification structure.
- Estimated practical accuracy:
  - Around 72% of LCM2000's maximum potential accuracy when compared at the per-parcel Target level (roughly 85% possible at the Target class level in ideal conditions).
  - Time differences (FS ~1998 vs LCM2000 images 1998–2001) and MMU differences account for many discrepancies.
- The study stresses that LCM2000’s accuracy should be interpreted as a relative measure against field-based calibrations rather than absolute ground truth.

## Change Detection

- Detecting landscape change from 1990 to 2000 with satellite data alone is challenging due to resolution, data models, and sampling differences.
- Segment-based LCM2000 results differ from 1990 raster outputs; direct BH-level comparisons are limited.
- A more intelligent, integrated approach is recommended, leveraging FS data from 1990 and 1998 to identify plausible changes and distinguish them from classification/error.
- Future work: Develop change-detection methods that use known change patterns (from FS) and consider calibration results to improve reliability.

## Appendix I: Broad Habitats Overview

- Provides definitions and distinguishing features for BHs and guidance on how spectral/remote-sensing signals relate to field-based classifications.
- Highlights the inherent difficulty of distinguishing certain swards and soil types spectrally (e.g., Neutral vs Calcareous vs Acid grasses) and the role of context (soil pH, peat depth) in classification.
- Outlines general approaches for differentiating woodland types, arable vs. grassland, and coastal habitats, noting where field data or contextual maps are essential for accuracy.

- Overall takeaway for GIS practitioners:
  - Calibrating broad habitat maps against detailed field data yields more usable statistics (BH statistics) but requires careful interpretation of resolution limits, MMU, and timing differences.
  - Use the BH/Target/Aggregate framework to balance map reliability and the need for detailed reporting.
  - Be mindful of classification ambiguities (especially semi-natural vs improved grasslands, bog vs heath, rough grasslands) and consider integrating external datasets (soil, peat maps, altitudinal context) to refine classifications.
  - Change-detection should rely on integrated, multi-temporal analyses rather than satellite data alone, leveraging field survey patterns and prior knowledge of land-cover changes.
