# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity; policy applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.
- Why locations are confidential: To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for survey integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permissions.
- Legal framework: Requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Circumstances for release and precision level:
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) can be released under licence to indicate approximate locations.
  - Six-digit grid references (more precise) are only released in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, requiring pre-processing by CEH to avoid direct release or demonstration that external IP/privacy standards are as stringent as CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats/linear features) carry equivalent confidentiality and may be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- General licensing conditions:
  - Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and restricted to named individuals with legitimate project need.
  - Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at license end.
  - No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could reveal square locations; data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; both prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; signs on behalf of the licensee organisation.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - CEH should, subject to moderate demand, assist internal CS partnership users with necessary pre-processing analyses; external requests are handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult with CEH before committing to use any data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may vary by project and will be negotiated.
