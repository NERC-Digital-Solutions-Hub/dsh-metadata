# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Scope and aim
  - Maximise the public-interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey site locations.
  - Applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- CS partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for future surveying, environmental protection, and ongoing permission from landowners.
  - Confidentiality supports scientific integrity and informed environmental policy.
  - Requests for information handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- When and how locations may be released
  - Four-digit grid references (identifying 10x10 km grid squares) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only allowed in very exceptional circumstances, requiring legal demonstration that the associated IP/data has equal or higher confidentiality than CS data; processing may be done by CEH to avoid direct release.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) have equivalent risk to location data and are released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- Specific licensing conditions
  - Licences must preserve confidentiality, with secure storage and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at licence end, with written confirmation.
  - No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
  - If uncertain, consult CEH; data must not be used to derive precise square locations or identify landowners.
  - IP/confidentiality requirements: six-digit releases require stronger safeguards; four-digit releases have less stringent but still defined limitations.
  - A clause prevents using released data to pinpoint exact CS square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC and the CS partners, decides on exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with policy-reflective terms; licences signed by a senior authorised official.
  - If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI/EIR procedures to support the decision.
  - CEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision rationales.
  - CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS partner use; external requests are considered case by case.
  - It is recommended that potential users consult CEH before commitment to data use; CEH may facilitate collaboration with a scientific lead, with arrangements possibly involving collaborative or paid support.
