# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to maximise the public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.

- Who are the CS partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
  - Defra
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission from landowners to survey land.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- Circumstances and level of precision for release
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence to show approximate location within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, or Environmental Zone).
  - Six-digit grid references or precise location data: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, and only if the requester demonstrates, legally, that their IP data is equally or more confidential/protected than CS data; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing raw locations.
  - Spatial data within survey squares could also be used to identify square location and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational use after the period ends.
  - Upon expiry, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
  - No data or derivatives should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If required, licensees may need to provide evidence of JCOP-level project management standards.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but are less stringent regarding IP confidentiality; users must not attempt to derive precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate terms.
  - If access is denied, CEH follows FOI/EIR procedures to support the decision.
  - CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; other organisations’ requests are case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before using CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

- Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Balances public health and policy utility of spatial data with the need to protect sampling integrity and landowner relations.
  - Introduces formal licensing, data governance, and pre-processing steps to enable controlled data use.
  - Requires clear accountability, documentation, and periodic reporting on data access activities.
