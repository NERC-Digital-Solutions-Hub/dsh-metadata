# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protects representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for the survey’s scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Protecting confidentiality supports the public interest; requests are handled by CEH under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Four-digit grid references (identifying 10x10 km grid squares) may be released under licence for certain needs.
- Six-digit precise locations are only allowed in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external requests must show IP data with equal/higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms.
- In general, practitioners may learn whether squares fall within predetermined areas but not precise locations.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to approved individuals for the agreed purpose.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational duties.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- Data (including derived or original) must not be shared with third parties that could reveal square locations.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have comparatively lower IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases and include constraints to prevent pinpointing exact locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; approvals signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal use through reasonable pre-processing analysis within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use any data covered by this policy; CEH may assist in defining requirements or supporting appropriate use, potentially on a collaborative or paid basis.
