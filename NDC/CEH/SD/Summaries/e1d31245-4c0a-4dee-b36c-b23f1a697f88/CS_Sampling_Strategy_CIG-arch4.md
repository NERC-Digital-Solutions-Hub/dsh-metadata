# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the field survey sampling strategy used in Countryside Survey 2007 and traces its evolution from the initial ITE Land Classification (started in 1978).
- Emphasizes a stratified, random sampling approach to ensure representative coverage of Britain’s countryside and to support national and country-specific habitat estimates.
- Shows how classification changes and country-specific reporting requirements influenced sampling design over time.

## The ITE Land Classification: core idea and evolution
- Stratified approach: divide land into discrete classes (strata) based on environmental attributes to reduce sampling bias and better capture ecological variability.
- Original basis (mid-1970s): use Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on 1 km squares to define 32 land classes from environmental data.
- Sampling unit: 1 km squares, with surrounding squares allocated to the same class to reflect landscape context.
- Purpose: link land classes to national estimates of habitat areas by multiplying mean habitat area per square by the land-class area.

## The CS1978 framework (Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey)
- 32 land classes derived from classification of 1228 centre squares (15 x 15 km grid).
- For each centre square, four surrounding squares were classified, yielding 6039 squares classified in total.
- Surveyed eight squares per land class (256 total) in a single field season.
- National habitat estimates computed as the product of the mean habitat area per square and the total area of each land class.

## The CS1984 framework (2nd Field Survey)
- Expanded sampling to 12 squares per land class (384 squares total), maintaining the 32-class structure.
- Eight previously visited squares were retained per class.
- Retrospective national estimates discussed; broader coverage improved precision but relied on the 1978 framework for some estimates.

## The CS1990 framework (All Squares land classification; 3rd Field Survey)
- Land classification updated to classify every square in GB (not just a sample of squares), enabling regional and local estimates.
- 508 squares surveyed; all features from CS1984 were recorded again plus a repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats.
- Satellite-derived Land Cover Map linked to the program.
- Classification changes caused some shifts in class representation; 62% correspondence with the prior classification, but non-matching squares tended to fall into neighboring classes with similar characteristics.

## The CS2000 framework (New classification; separate country estimates)
- Aimed to provide reliable England, Scotland, and Wales (ESW) country-level estimates.
- Land Classes were subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata created (expanding from 32).
- Additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new classes in each country; overall more squares than CS1990.
- England & Wales upland module added (30 squares) to improve accuracy for upland habitats in that region.
- Summary statistics (sample sizes and sampling rates) provided to show distribution across country units and classes.

## The CS2007 framework (Welsh-focused adjustments and continued country units)
- Responded to devolution needs for Wales-only reporting; Wales required more robust sampling than in CS2000.
- Introduced five new country-unit classes for England & Wales (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
- Increased Wales sampling to ensure at least six squares per Welsh class; added 43 Welsh squares.
- England adjustments: no corresponding increase in English squares; two English classes (5e, 15e) left with four squares each, deemed acceptable per scoping studies.
- Results summarized in revised class maps and tables showing the distribution of sample squares across England, Wales, and Scotland.

## Data governance and implications for long-term surveillance
- Changing the Land Classification affects consistency of national stock estimates; studies recommend using the latest classification for country-based estimates while noting cross-survey consistency.
- Table-based notes show how the number of squares and strata evolved across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, illustrating the balance between representativeness, precision, and policy needs.
- Wales and Scotland require separate reporting, driving sub-classes and additional sampling in those regions.
- The strategy underpins how national estimates are constructed (area by class × mean habitat per square) and how changes in classification impact time-series comparability.
