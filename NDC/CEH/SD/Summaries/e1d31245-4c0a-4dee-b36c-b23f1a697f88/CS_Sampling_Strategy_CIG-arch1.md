# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Documents the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007, and its evolution from early 1970s concepts to a UK-wide, country-specific reporting system.
- Links the sampling design tightly to the ITE Land Classification, a stratified environmental framework used to ensure representative sampling across Great Britain.
- Emphasizes the need to understand earlier methodologies to interpret current and future time-series data.

## Core Concepts: Stratification and Land Classification
- Stratified, random sampling is used to avoid bias and ensure samples represent the full variability of land across GB.
- ITE Land Classification: groups land based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to create land classes that define sampling strata.
- Initial approach used a 1 km square sampling unit with centre squares classified and surrounding squares allocated to the same or neighboring classes to build a robust framework for national estimates.
- Practical constraints (early computing) led to using a subset of classified squares for full analysis while preserving environmental representativeness.

## Timeline of Developments

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1 km squares (centre of 15 x 15 km grid).
  - 4 surrounding squares per centre were also classified, creating a total of 6039 km squares for sampling.
  - 8 squares per land class were surveyed (total 256 squares).
  - National habitat estimates were derived by multiplying mean habitat area per square within each class by the class’s total GB area.

- 1984 – Second Field Survey
  - Expanded sampling to 12 squares per land class (384 total), including eight previously visited squares.
  - National estimates based on the 1978 Land Classification.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and Third Field Survey
  - Land Classification updated to classify every GB square; urban and sea corrections included.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repetition of 1978 vegetation quadrats and additional features recorded.
  - National estimates were calculated using the 1990 Land Classification.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification and Fourth Field Survey
  - Further refinement to allow separate Scottish reporting; Land Classes increased to 40.
  - Fourth survey involved 569 GB squares.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Aimed to produce separate reliable estimates for England & Wales vs. Scotland; and improved upland habitat estimates.
  - Land Classification subdivided to create country-unit versions (England with Wales and Scotland); class aggregation used where needed to maintain representation.
  - Added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; additional adjustments to 5e and 15e classes left with 4 squares in some instances.
  - Upland module introduced to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.
  - Summary tables (e.g., Tables 2 and 4 in the report) detail class distributions and sampling rates.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements driven: Wales needed Wales-only habitat status data for policy and legislation.
  - Welsh class subdivisions created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure adequate representation; some English classes reduced to 4 squares per class due to limited new Welsh samples.
  - England, Scotland, and Wales sample maps updated accordingly; Table 3 shows updated square counts and sampling rates.

## Sampling Framework Details
- Sampling units: 1 km squares; base framework derives from central 1 km squares within a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares classified to support stratification.
- National estimates: calculated as the mean habitat area per square for each land class multiplied by the total land area of that class in GB.
- Country-specific reporting: CS2000 and CS2007 introduced country-unit versions of land classes to enable England & Wales and Scotland-specific estimates; additional sampling and aggregation adjustments ensured adequate representation within each country.
- Strata and sample sizes:
  - 1978: 32 land classes; 256 total sample squares (8 per class).
  - 1984: 32 classes across all GB with 384 squares (12 per class).
  - 1990: all GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; larger emphasis on regional and local estimates.
  - CS2000: expanded to 40 land classes (reflecting updates) and introduced separate country estimates with added samples; upland module added.
  - CS2007: 45 strata (country-unit subdivisions) with Welsh-focused sampling and 43 additional Welsh squares; overall adjustments to maintain precision.
- Data consistency: note discusses the trade-off between using the latest classification for national estimates vs. maintaining cross-survey consistency using the original 1990 classification.

## Country-Specific Adjustments and Upland Module
- Separate country estimates: England with Wales and Scotland treated as distinct units; class sub-divisions created to align with country boundaries; some classes aggregated within a country when representation was low.
- Wales-focused enhancements (CS2007): five new Welsh country-unit classes; additional Welsh squares to ensure robust Wales-only reporting; overall strata increased.
- Upland habitat module (CS2000): targeted sampling in upland and marginal upland areas to boost statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates.

## National Estimates and Consistency
- Changing the land-class framework affects national estimates; 2006 scoping study notes the trade-off between country-specific reporting using latest classifications and cross-survey consistency.
- Preference for latest classification in country-specific reporting, while maintaining methodological continuity for time-series comparisons.
