# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview and purpose
  - Describes the field sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification used to stratify the Countryside Survey of Great Britain.
  - Aims to produce representative, map-based data products to estimate and monitor habitat types and land use across GB, with country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland).

- ITE Land Classification: origin and role
  - Developed in the 1970s to stratify ecological sampling by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
  - Based on classifying 1 km squares (the sampling unit) using a multivariate approach (Indicator Species Analysis originally; environmental surrogates later).
  - Led to a hierarchical set of land classes (starting with 32, later expanded to 40, then 45) used to guide sampling design and national estimates.

- Evolution of the sampling framework by survey year
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - Centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid were classified; surrounding four squares also classified.
    - 8 samples per Land Class were surveyed (total 256 squares).
    - National habitat estimates derived from class means and the area of each class.
  - 1984 (Second GB survey)
    - Expanded to 12 squares per Land Class (total 384).
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Revised to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Introduced a Land Cover Map linked to this program.
  - 2000 (Developments for CS2000)
    - Addressed the need for Scotland and England–Wales separate estimates and better upland habitat representation.
    - Revisions to allow country-unit reporting; added 40 strata (sub-division and aggregation of classes); 19 additional squares to ensure coverage of new classes; some adjustments to ensure Wales representation.
    - A upland habitat module added to improve estimates in uplands.
  - 2007 (Developments for CS2007)
    - Further Welsh-specific refinements due to devolution and policy needs.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating five new Welsh/English classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and a total of 45 strata.
    - Additional squares allocated in Wales (43 new squares) to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class; some English classes subsequently reduced in sampling to maintain balance.
    - England remained with 2 English classes (5e, 15e) reduced to 4 squares per class but deemed acceptable for precision.
    - Wales and Scotland receive revised class maps and separate reporting framework.

- Data products and GIS implications
  - Land Classification maps: visual maps of GB-wide and country-specific classifications across survey cycles (1978, 1990, 2000, 2007; with England-with-Wales and Scotland revisions in 1990–2007).
  - Sample square maps and tabulations: lists and figures showing where samples were drawn and how many squares per class per survey.
  - Country-unit reporting: methodology to produce England & Wales vs Scotland estimates, including class subdivisions and aggregation to ensure adequate representation per country.
  - Upland module data: targeted sampling in upland and marginal upland areas to improve precision for those habitats.
  - Data consistency considerations: cross-survey comparability requires selecting definitions/classifications (latest vs original) for national estimates, discussed in the note on national estimates.

- Key principles and methodological notes for GIS use
  - Stratified random sampling is used to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation across GB.
  - 1 km square units enable consistent spatial data products and integration with other GIS datasets.
  - Class definitions evolve over time; users should be aware of changes in classification schemes when integrating across survey years.
  - Isle of Man sample squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced to maintain country-specific reporting integrity.
  - The framework supports Wales-only and Scotland-only reporting, reflecting devolved policy needs and enabling targeted spatial analyses.

- Endnotes and context
  - The strategy underpins published results for CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 (with corresponding national and country-specific reports).
  - Acknowledges methodological and computational constraints historically (e.g., early reliance on centre squares due to limited computing power; later expansion to classify all GB squares).
  - Provides a historical Appendix and references outlining the development and applications of the ITE Land Classification in landscape ecology and policy-relevant environmental reporting.
