# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- This document traces the evolution of the Sampling Strategy and the ITE Land Classification used to stratify field surveys for Countryside Survey over three decades, linking current methods to their historical roots.

## Beginning: foundational concepts and 1978 framework

- Goal: create a representative national ecological sampling system for Great Britain using stratified sampling to avoid bias.
- Core idea: stratify land into discrete land classes and sample within each class.
- ITE Land Classification origin: developed in the 1970s from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) and used Indicator Species Analysis to group land into 32 classes.
- Sampling design (1978): select the centre square of a 15x15 km grid (1228 squares classified); include the four surrounding squares for a total of 6039 km squares classified.
- Field survey: 8 km squares per Land Class (total 256 squares) surveyed; national habitat area estimates derived from mean habitat area per square in each class times the land class area.
- Documentation and early outputs described in 1984/1986 publications.

## Middle: expansion, refinement, and all-squares approach

- 1984 survey: increased sampling to 12 squares per land class (384 total) to improve estimates; eight squares from 1978 were revisited.
- 1990 Countryside Survey (CS1990): broadened Land Classification to cover all 1 km squares in GB; added urban/sea corrections; 508 squares surveyed.
- Land Cover Map of GB linked to CS1990; continued use of Land Classification for sampling, with some squares reclassified during the upgrade.
- Classification evolution (CS1990): recognition that classification needed to extend to every square; initial attempts to classify all GB squares with surrogates and multivariate methods; results showed about 62% class agreement with the original, but neighboring classes generally preserved characteristics, enabling a reasonable replacement.
- Implications: reclassification affected national and regional estimates; some shifts in class representation across the country.

## Transition: CS2000 – country-specific estimates and expanded coverage

- CS2000 introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales together vs. Scotland) to meet policy and reporting needs.
- Structural changes:
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Aggregation of underrepresented rump classes within countries, creating 40 strata (up from 32).
  - Additional squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; higher sampling in the English/Welsh split to balance representation.
  - Wales-specific refinement of Land Class 17 through sub-division to improve Wales reporting.
  - Isle of Man sampling adjusted (two prior squares removed and replaced with England squares) for country-unit reporting.
- Uplands module: added 30 squares in upland/marginal areas of England and Wales to improve habitat estimates in those zones.
- Outputs: revised country-specific maps and tables; CS2000 total samples and distributions summarized (England & Wales vs. Scotland).

## Recent refinement: CS2007 – Wales reporting, country-unit framework, and expanded classes

- Welsh-only reporting continued to drive methodological refinements after devolution.
- Key changes:
  - Land Classes further subdivided into country-unit versions, creating five new Wales/England-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata expanded to 45.
  - Added 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure sufficient representation in Wales; minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - England adjustments: no corresponding English square increases to compensate for Welsh additions; some English classes (5e, 15e) may have only 4 squares, deemed acceptable per scoping study findings.
- Outputs: CS2007 survey numbers show the distribution of squares across classes and countries, with Wales receiving a notably higher sampling rate to support Wales-only estimates.

## Data governance notes and implications for consistency

- National estimates are sensitive to the Land Classification used; changes across versions can affect comparability over time.
- Two options considered for consistency: (a) recalculate GB-wide estimates using the latest classification version for each survey, or (b) retain the original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency. The guidance favors using the latest classification within each survey for internal consistency, while acknowledging cross-survey comparability considerations.
- Documentation emphasizes the importance of clear metadata on classification versions, country-unit distinctions, and sampling allocations to support transparent data governance and reuse.

## End matter: acknowledgements, references, and further reading

- Acknowledgements recognize contributions from individuals involved in statistical guidance, mapping, and data synthesis.
- A substantial list of references and further reading documents the methodological foundations, historical developments, and methodological papers related to the ITE Land Classification and Countryside Survey sampling strategy.

## Key takeaways for data stewardship

- The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey presents a long-running, governance-aware approach to stratified ecological sampling, anchored by the ITE Land Classification.
- Over time, the framework evolved from a 32-class GB-wide stratification to a country-unit framework with up to 45 active strata, including Wales- and Scotland-specific adaptations.
- Versioning and metadata are critical: classifications, country units, and sample allocations must be clearly documented to ensure traceability and appropriate use in national vs. regional reporting.
- The approach includes repeated sampling within strata, documented changes to class definitions, and explicit guidance on how to handle updates to maintain data integrity and comparability.
- The document provides a thorough historical basis for understanding how current datasets were constructed, enabling transparent data governance, reproducibility, and informed data sharing.
