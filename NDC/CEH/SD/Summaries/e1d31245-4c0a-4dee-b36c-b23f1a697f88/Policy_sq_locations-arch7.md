# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include CEH (NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys and environmental policy relevance.
- Requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release and precision levels
- Access can help identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence to indicate location within a grid.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only considered in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional-access terms as six-digit references.
- Any release aims to preserve confidentiality and not enable pinpointing of square locations.

## Specific licensing conditions
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the license.
- End-of-licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must show JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
- Four-digit releases: similar licensing terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases; still prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with confidentiality clauses.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support reasonable pre-processing analyses within moderate demand; case-by-case for external requests.
- Partners and potential data users are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before using CS location data; CEH involvement may vary and can be negotiated.

## Practical implications for GIS work
- Location data can be used to assess square inclusion within larger administrative or environmental zones, subject to licensing.
- Workflows should favor pre-processing or anonymized analyses to minimize need for releasing precise locations.
- Always comply with licensing terms, confidentiality obligations, and destruction requirements at project end.
- Consider engaging CEH early to align data needs with the policy and to explore permissible processing options.
