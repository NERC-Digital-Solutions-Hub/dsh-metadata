# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) 2007 and its evolution over 30 years.
- Central concept: use the ITE Land Classification to create stratified, representative samples of Great Britain (GB) to detect ecological change and support policy decisions.
- Emphasizes linking sampling with a consistent data framework to enable national and country-level estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and, later, upland refinements.

## Core concepts and foundations
- Stratified sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation across land.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to define land classes; original system created in the mid-1970s.
- Sampling units: 1 km squares classified; initial sampling used center squares plus surrounding squares to form the dataset for classification.
- National estimates: derived by combining class-level statistics (area, habitat means) with the land-class distribution across GB.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and CS sampling (timeline)

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification & First Field Survey
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to produce 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 center 1 km squares.
  - Four surrounding squares per center were classified; total ~6039 km squares.
  - Eight samples per land class (8 × 32 = 256 squares) surveyed.
  - National habitat estimates calculated as mean habitat area per class times the land-class area.

- 1984 – Second GB Land Use Survey
  - Sampling expanded: 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Continued use of 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - Example change statistics published later.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey
  - Land Classification updated to classify every GB square (all squares); urban and sea corrections applied.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repetition of 1978 vegetation quadrats; additional data collected.
  - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report; tie-in with first GB Land Cover Map.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification (CS1990 framework) & Fourth Field Survey
  - Land Classification extended to enable separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
  - 569 squares surveyed (CS1998 reference for fieldwork).
  - National estimates re-based on updated classification; broader policy relevance.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Need to provide separate country estimates (England with Wales vs Scotland); counties allocated by country units.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; broader class aggregation where necessary (now 40 strata → 40–45 strata with subdivisions).
  - Additional samples added to ensure representation of new country-unit classes; uplands module added to improve upland habitat estimates (England & Wales).
  - Wales samples increased to improve Wales-only reporting; England samples adjusted accordingly.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting needs refined; further subdivisions created for country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares (43) added to guarantee minimum representation per Welsh class.
  - England had reductions in some classes but overall precision deemed acceptable per scoping studies.
  - Revised country maps and sampling framework published to reflect England, Wales, and Scotland distinctions.
  - Outputs continued to include national and country-specific estimates, with emphasis on Wales reporting and policy needs.

## Data outputs and usage
- Outputs include national and country-specific estimates of habitat areas and landscape features, supported by maps and tables (CS1990–CS2007 publications).
- Documentation highlights how changing land classifications affects consistency of national estimates and the preferred approach for a survey (country-specific vs GB-wide consistency).
- Emphasizes the need for adequate sample sizes per class, especially for Wales, to deliver reliable country-unit estimates.

## Special modules and adjustments
- Uplands module (CS2000): added 30 squares in upland/marginal upland counties to improve accuracy of upland habitat estimates for England and Wales.
- Welsh-only reporting: expanded Welsh sampling and introduced Welsh-specific land-class subdivisions to meet policy and legislative needs.

## Practical implications for data support
- Robust, stratified sampling framework linked to a dynamic land-class system; supports time-series analysis and cross-country comparisons.
- Highlights the trade-off between classification changes and comparability across survey years; recommends alignment with the latest classification for consistency in national estimates.
- Demonstrates the importance of targeted sampling adjustments to meet devolved government needs (Wales, Scotland) and policy drivers (upland habitats).
