# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise utility of CS spatial data in the public interest while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Defra
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- The Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Confidentiality protects sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release conditions and precision levels
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to show which grid square contains CS squares, for predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit precise locations require CEH preprocessing to avoid release; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may external access be granted under licence if the requester demonstrates comparable or higher confidentiality protections for their own data.
- Spatial data within survey squares could indirectly identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit locations.

## Licensing terms and data handling
- Licences preserve confidentiality, require secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licence.
- End-of-period: written confirmation that data was secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derivatives should be released to third parties that could reveal square locations; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar licensing terms but do not require the same IP confidentiality level as six-digit releases, and users must not attempt to derive precise locations or claim they have done so.

## Governance, responsibilities, and process
- CEH, for NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; licences must be signed by an authorized representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report on licence applications and decision grounds.
- CEH strives to support pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe for CS partners; other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid and is negotiated case-by-case.
