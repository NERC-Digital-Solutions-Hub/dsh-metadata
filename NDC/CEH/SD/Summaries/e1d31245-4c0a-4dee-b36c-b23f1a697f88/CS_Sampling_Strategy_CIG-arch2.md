# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Documents the field sampling strategy used by Countryside Survey (CS) from its origins to the 2007 survey.
  - Grounded in the ITE Land Classification, a stratified framework designed to produce representative, time-series environmental data across Great Britain.
  - Sampling unit: 1 km squares, selected within stratified land classes to capture ecological and land-use variation.
  - Aims to enable consistent, comparable estimates of habitat areas and landscape characteristics over time; supports national, and later country-specific, reporting.

- Key concepts: Stratification and land classification
  - Early rationale: avoid bias by stratifying the population (ecological units) into discrete strata with similar characteristics.
  - The ITE Land Classification classifies land based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to create homogeneous land classes.
  - Sampling within classes ensures all parts of the landscape are represented in national estimates.

- Timeline of Land Classification developments and sampling framework
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used on environmental data from 1228 centre squares (1 km) to define 32 land classes.
    - Final sampling: eight squares per class (256 total); four surrounding centre squares also classified.
    - National habitat estimates derived by multiplying mean habitat area per square by land-class area; results published subsequently.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Sampling increased: 12 squares per land class (total 384).
    - Emphasis shifted toward land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification updated to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Integrated with Land Cover Map (from satellite imagery); urban/sea corrections applied.
    - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - 1998–2000 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
    - Towards nationwide, square-by-square classification; computing constraints led to using surrogates for some squares.
    - Classes expanded to allow Scotland-only reporting; total of 40 land classes.
    - Adjustments made to enable separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and to improve regional accuracy.
    - Separate country estimation framework implemented: class sub-division into country units, class aggregation where necessary, and additional sampling to ensure representation; upland modules added.
  - 2007 (Revised Land Classification; 5th Field Survey)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements prompted further refinement.
    - Wales-specific class subdivisions created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), increasing to 45 strata.
    - Additional Welsh squares (43) added to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class; English sampling adjusted due to Welsh additions.
    - Wales became the most densely sampled country; England and Scotland sampling complemented to maintain comparability.
    - Upland sampling module expanded with 30 extra squares targeted to upland and marginal upland habitats.

- Country-specific sampling and upland module
  - England with Wales and Scotland treated as separate reporting units for national estimates.
  - Sampling framework adapted (class sub-divisions and aggregations) to produce robust country-level estimates.
  - Upland module added in CS2000 to improve precision for upland habitats in England and Wales.

- Data outputs, representation, and caveats
  - Tables and maps (referenced in the document) show the distribution of sample squares by land class and country unit.
  - The strategy emphasizes maintaining representative coverage across the landscape, tracking changes over time, and ensuring compatibility across survey waves.
  - Note on consistency: changing land classifications across surveys affects cross-survey comparability of national estimates; preferred approach is to use the latest classification for consistency within a survey while recognizing historical classification differences when comparing across surveys.
