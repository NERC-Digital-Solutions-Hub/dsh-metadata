# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy used in Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Built on the ITE Land Classification, developed over the last 30 years since 1978.
  - Emphasizes a stratified, random sampling framework to produce representative, time-series data on habitat and land use.

- Core concepts for data governance
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental stratification system that groups land into discrete classes to ensure representative sampling.
  - Stratified sampling with random selection to avoid bias and to capture variability across land types.
  - Use of 1 km squares as the primary sampling unit; classification of squares to land classes drives the sampling framework.
  - Time-series linkage: successive Surveys (1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2000, 2007) are anchored to evolving land-class definitions, affecting comparability.

- Evolution of the Land Classification and sampling framework
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and first field survey)
    - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to create 32 land classes from environmental attributes of 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15x15 km grid).
    - 8 squares per land class surveyed (total 256).
    - National habitat area estimates derived from class proportions and class area.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Same framework with 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
    - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; urban/sea corrections applied.
    - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats plus additional features.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; fourth field survey)
    - Land Classification expanded to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
    - National estimates aligned to the 1990 framework but with expanded classification.
  - 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000)
    - Adjustments to enable separate England & Wales and Scotland reporting.
    - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions; aggregation where necessary; additional squares to ensure representation of new classes (40 strata to 40).
    - An uplands module added to improve estimates for upland habitats in England & Wales.
  - 2007 (Revised Land Classification; fifth field survey)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further Welsh class subdivisions (five new Welsh-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class) and adjustments in England.
    - Welsh- and England-specific sampling adjustments implemented; uplands module continued to support country-specific estimates.

- Country-specific estimates and data structure
  - Throughout, there is a distinction between country-level estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) and GB-wide estimates.
  - For Wales and England, classes are subdivided into country-unit versions to enable country-specific reporting.
  - Class numbers, sample sizes, and sampling rates adjusted to maintain representation across countries and to accommodate devolution-related reporting needs.

- Uplands module
  - An additional CS2000 module introducing 30 squares in uplands and marginal uplands of England and Wales.
  - Aimed at improving statistical accuracy of upland habitat estimates within country-based reporting.

- Data products and documentation
  - Main results published in sector-specific reports:
    - CS1990: Countryside Survey 1990 – main report.
    - CS2000: Countryside Survey – UK results from 2000.
    - CS2007: Countryside Survey – UK results from 2007.
  - Land Classification maps and class descriptions accompany the sampling framework and enable reproducibility and cross-survey comparability.
  - Documentation discusses methodological choices, sampling frames, and the implications of changing land classifications for national estimates.

- Data governance considerations highlighted
  - Comparability across surveys is challenged by changes in Land Classification; two approaches are discussed:
    - Use the latest classification for consistency within a survey.
    - Use the original classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - The appendix outlines the historical development and data lineage, essential for traceability, metadata, and reproducibility.
  - Funding, agencies involved, and acknowledgments provide context for data provenance and governance.

- Practical implications for data stewards
  - Maintain metadata on classification version, country-unit definitions, and enumerated class sub-divisions.
  - Ensure clear linkage between years’ sampling frames and the corresponding Land Classification used.
  - Preserve documentation of uplands modules and country-specific adjustments to support country-based analyses.
  - Be aware of potential comparability issues when aggregating results across surveys with different classifications.
  - Archive state of classifications, sampling numbers, stratum areas, and square counts to enable auditability and re-use.
