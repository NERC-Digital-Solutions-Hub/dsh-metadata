# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose: Document the evolution of the ITE Land Classification-based sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field work up to 2007, linking current methods to thirty years of prior development.

- Core idea: Use stratified, random sampling anchored by an environmental stratification (ITE Land Classification) to ensure representative coverage of Britain's countryside and enable robust national, regional, and country-specific estimates.

- Key concepts
  - Stratified sampling to minimize bias and capture variability across land types.
  - ITE Land Classification: environment-based classification of land into discrete classes to guide sampling.
  - Field sampling units: 1 km squares (with centre squares used initially; later expansions and sub-divisions).
  - National estimates: derived by combining mean habitat areas per square within each Land Class with the total area of each class.

- Early development and rationale
  - The idea of large-scale ecological survey matured in the 1970s, with Bunce and Shaw developing a stratified approach to achieve representativeness.
  - Stratification reduces risk that pure random sampling would over- or under-sample extreme cases, ensuring samples span the full range of ecological variation.

- The sampling framework through the years
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
    - Basis: 32 Land Classes derived from environmental attributes using Indicator Species Analysis.
    - Sampling: 8 squares per class, total of 256 squares.
    - Output: estimated area per Land Class for Great Britain; plotting of habitat areas by class.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Increased sample: 12 squares per class (384 total), extending prior results.
    - National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square (508 squares surveyed).
    - Integration with the first Land Cover Map of GB; repeat of some earlier vegetation data.
    - National estimates based on the 1990 Land Classification; results published in CS1990 main report.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
    - Land Classification updated to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
    - 4th field survey included, with broader representation of Scotland.
  - 2000 (CS2000; 5th Field Survey)
    - Emphasis on producing separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland, and Wales reporting).
    - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions; class aggregation where necessary; total of 40–45 strata.
    - Additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes; upland habitat module added to improve upland estimates.
    - Output: revised sampling distribution and country-specific estimates; map and tables illustrating sampling framework.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Welsh-specific adjustments; 6th Field Survey progression)
    - Wales-specific reporting emphasis led to further Wales-England-Wales class subdivisions (including five new Welsh country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure adequate Welsh representation.
    - England adjustments: some classes reduced to 4 squares per class; overall precision considered acceptable per scoping studies.
    - Final outputs: updated maps and tables showing England, Wales, and Scotland sampling distributions.

- Wales and uplands
  - Wales-only reporting requirements prompted targeted sampling expansions and class subdivisions for Wales.
  - An uplands module was added to CS2000/CS2007 to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- National estimates and methodological notes
  - Estimates can be produced using either the latest land classification (country-specific classifications) or the original 1990 classification; the 2006 scoping study recommends using the latest classification for consistency within surveys, but acknowledges cross-survey consistency considerations.
  - Output strategy includes maps, lists of class-specific sample counts, and sampling rates to enable transparency and replication.

- Outputs and interpretation
  - Results are presented as country-specific estimates and, where appropriate, GB-wide estimates derived from Land Class proportions and square-level data.
  - The strategy emphasizes reproducibility, explicit representation of all Land Classes, and alignment with policy-relevant reporting needs (e.g., Wales-only reporting, upland habitats).

- Practical implications for data work
  - The Sampling Strategy demonstrates how to design a long-running, policy-relevant data program with evolving classifications and country-specific reporting needs.
  - Highlights the importance of maintaining representative sampling across changing classifications, documenting changes clearly, and providing transparent national-estimation methodologies.
  - Provides a framework for producing self-contained data products (class-level summaries, stratum counts, sampling rates, and maps) to support stakeholder interpretation and reuse.
