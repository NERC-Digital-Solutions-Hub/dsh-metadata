# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Outlines the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007, detailing how the ITE Land Classification has evolved and how samples were selected to monitor habitat change across Great Britain.

## Core concepts and origins

- The Countryside Survey relies on a stratified, random sampling approach to ensure samples are representative of land types and minimize bias.
- The ITE Land Classification started in the 1970s to stratify GB land into homogeneous environmental classes, enabling robust national and regional estimates.
- Early work used a central 1 km square for classification (1978) with surrounding squares assigned to classes to form a stable, repeatable stratification system.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification and sampling

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to create 32 land classes from environmental data of 1 km squares ( centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1215 classified).
  - Sampled 8 squares per land class, totaling 256 squares nationwide.
  - National habitat estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per square within each land class with the total area of that class.

- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Expanded sample to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares (more comprehensive but conservative).
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping; first link to the Land Cover Map of GB.

- 1990s: Refined classifications and comparability
  - Recognized need to classify every GB square; tested multiple approaches to extend the Land Classification.
  - Comparison between original 1228-square classification and new methods yielded 62% exact correspondence; non-identical squares generally fell into neighboring classes, preserving overall class characteristics.

## CS2000: Revised framework and country-based reporting

- Rationale: Demand for separate, country-specific estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) for policy and governance.
- Changes:
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (England with Wales; Scotland), creating expanded strata (40).
  - Aggregation applied where a country had few squares in a class to maintain representation.
  - Added 19 squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; further 11 squares allocated to balance England and Wales sampling.
  - Wales received enhanced representation with a Wales-specific subdivision (5 new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates; replaced with new England squares for England-Wales reporting.
- Uplands module: Added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland classes to improve habitat estimates in uplands for England and Wales.

## CS2000 sampling details and outputs

- The plan produced a tabulated summary of sample squares by class and country, showing distribution, sampling rates, and total squares.
- Emphasis: enabling robust country-level estimates while preserving GB-wide comparability.

## CS2007: Wales-focused reporting and further refinements

- Motivation: Devolution increased demand for Wales-only habitat information; needed more Wales-specific representation.
- Welsh-only adjustments:
  - Sub-divided land classes to create five new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Strata increased to 45; added 43 Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation (6 squares per Welsh class).
  - England adjustments: no equivalent increase; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained with 4 squares per class, deemed acceptable for reporting.
- England, Scotland, and Wales sample maps and class maps updated to reflect England-with-Wales and Scotland framings.
- Table 3 (CS2007) provides the updated counts of squares per class and country, including sampling rates.

## Note on national estimates and comparability

- A 2006 scoping study cautions that changing the basic Land Classification used for national estimates affects consistency; two approaches exist:
  - Use the latest country-specific classification for national estimates (preferred for internal consistency).
  - Use the original 1990 Land Classification for cross-survey consistency.
- The document provides a crosswalk (Table 4) of sample sizes per class across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, illustrating how sampling evolved.
