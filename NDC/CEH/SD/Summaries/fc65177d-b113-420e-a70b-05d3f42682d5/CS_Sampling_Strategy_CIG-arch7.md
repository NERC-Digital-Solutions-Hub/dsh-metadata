# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007, building on the ITE Land Classification developed over the previous 30 years.
- Emphasises use of a stratified, random sampling framework to ensure representative, map-based ecological and habitat data for GB-wide and country-specific estimates.
- Highlights how classifications evolve to support Wales-only, Scotland-only, and England & Wales reporting, and the implications for GIS-based data products.

## Key GIS Concepts and Data Products
- ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to define land classes; central 1 km squares classified, with surrounding squares allocated to classes for context.
- 1 km square sampling units:
  - 1978: 32 land classes derived from 1228 central squares; 8 squares per class surveyed (256 total).
  - 1984: sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total).
  - 1990: all GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; incorporation of Land Cover Map from satellite data.
- The classification maps and sampling grids underpin national and regional estimates of habitat areas and features.
- Figure-based and table-based outputs describe the distribution of sample squares by class and the sampling rates (e.g., 1:x values) for each survey year.

## Development Timeline and Sampling Frameworks
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used on environmental data to create 32 land classes from 1228 central squares; surrounding four squares per class designated.
  - Resulting frame: 6039 km squares classified; 256 squares surveyed nationally.
- 1984 (Second GB Land Use Survey)
  - Framework retained, expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); additional squares allocated without land-class-size weighting.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
  - Classification extended to all 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation/quadrat data collected; first link to Land Cover Map.
- 1998–2000 (Revised Land Classification & CS2000)
  - Revisions to enable Scotland-only reporting; separate country estimates introduced (England with Wales, Scotland).
  - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions; aggregation of rare classes; 40 strata overall; 19 extra squares added to ensure representation of new classes; upland habitat module added for England & Wales.
- 2007 (CS2007: Welsh Reporting & Updated Framework)
  - Wales-only reporting required; introduction of 5 new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total of 45 strata.
  - Wales received 43 additional Welsh squares; England unchanged or slightly adjusted; English classes 5e and 15e left with fewer squares but considered adequate by scoping study.
  - Revised maps and tables reflect England, Wales, and Scotland sampling frames.

## Separate Country Estimates and Wales Uplands Module
- England & Wales vs Scotland country units: sampling framework adapted to produce separate estimates by country.
- Wales-specific adjustments: added Welsh squares, sub-divided certain land classes for Wales, and allocated additional squares to maintain representation across Welsh classes.
- Upland habitat module: additional 30 squares in upland/marginal upland classes to improve statistical accuracy for upland estimates.

## Sampling Details and Outputs
- Tables and figures provide:
  - The number of squares surveyed per land class for each survey year (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - The distribution of squares across England, Wales, and Scotland, and the corresponding sampling rates (1:x).
  - Country-specific totals and the overall GB totals for sample sizes and strata areas.
- National estimates methodology (note on consistency):
  - Estimates typically derived from mean habitat area per square within each land class multiplied by the land class area.
  - Changes in land classification across surveys can affect cross-survey comparability; 1990 classification used for consistency within a survey, while newer classifications improve country-specific reporting.

## Practical GIS Implications
- GIS-ready data products include land classification maps by survey year, sampling grids, and country-unit strata definitions.
- Enables map-based visualization of habitat distribution, change detection across time, and clear presentation of country-specific habitat statistics.
- Users should consider classification changes when comparing across CS years; for consistent time-series analysis, align outputs to the most comparable classification or document the mapping year used for estimates.
