# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Introduction and Purpose
- Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Presents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and how it shapes sampling, stratification, and national estimates.
- Emphasizes that current methodology is built on decades of preceding work and remains linked to earlier time series.

## Core Methodology: Land Classification, Stratification, and Sampling Units
- Stratified, random sampling is used to ensure samples represent the broader countryside and to reduce bias.
- The primary sampling unit is the 1 km square, selected from a 15 km x 15 km grid.
- Early approach classified a subset of squares (center squares) and allocated surrounding squares to classes, creating a national stratification of land classes.
- ITE Land Classification: a multivariate system grouping land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- National estimates are derived by combining mean habitat area per square within a class with the total area of that class.
- Over time, the classification expanded from 32 to 40, then to 45 classes, to improve regional and country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and to reflect policy needs.

## Historical Evolution of Countryside Survey Sampling (1978–2007)
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data across 1,228 central squares.
  - Surrounding four squares per center were classified, resulting in about 6,039 km² classified.
  - Field surveys covered 8 km² per class, totaling 256 squares.
  - National habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each land class, scaled by class area.
- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - 12 squares per land class (total 384) were surveyed.
  - National estimates used the 1978 Land Classification; results published later.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; features recorded from CS1984 plus repeat vegetation quadrats.
  - Led to Countryside Survey 1990 main report publication in 1993.
- Early 1990s (Developments in Land Classification)
  - Recognition that a GB-wide, consistent classification would require extending classification to all squares.
  - A major reclassification exercise tested several schemes; best-fit approach produced 62% correspondence with the original, but similar class characteristics were maintained, enabling continued use for estimates.
- 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000 – CS2000)
  - Growing need for separate country estimates (England with Wales vs Scotland) led to framework modifications.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit variants; the total strata expanded from 32 to 40.
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes (minimum 6 squares per new class; extra allocations to England/Wales to balance sampling).
  - Wales-specific refinement: sub-division of Land Class 17; Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced.
  - Included a dedicated uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
- 2007 (Countryside Survey 2007 – CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting required more robust Wales-focused sampling post-devolution.
  - Wales-specific class subdivisions created five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares for adequate representation; England sampling adjusted to maintain precision where Welsh samples were added.
  - Revised class maps reflect England with Wales and Scotland frameworks for CS2007.

## Country-Specific Reporting and Upland Focus
- CS2000 introduced separate country-unit estimates (England with Wales and Scotland), requiring class subdivision and aggregation to ensure representation per country.
- CS2007 further refined for Wales-only reporting, introducing dedicated Welsh classes and additional Welsh sampling to bolster Wales-specific precision.
- An uplands module in CS2000 provided improved statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Data Outputs, National Estimates, and Consistency
- National estimates can be sensitive to the Land Classification used; a 2006 scoping study highlighted potential inconsistencies when replacing older classifications with newer ones.
- Preference for using the latest classification for GB estimates to maintain internal consistency within a survey, while recognizing cross-survey comparability challenges.
- Table and map summaries (by class, country, and year) illustrate sampling intensity and framework changes across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
