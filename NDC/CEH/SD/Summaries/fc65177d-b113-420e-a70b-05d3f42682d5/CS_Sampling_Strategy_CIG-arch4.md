# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Introduction
- Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007 and its link to the ITE Land Classification.
- Emphasises that current methodology is built on 30 years of development; understanding precedents is essential for interpreting time-series data.
- Highlights the goal of providing an objective, representative framework for estimating habitats and land-use features across Great Britain, with attention to country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales).

## The Beginnings: Stratified Sampling and the ITE Land Classification
- Core idea: use stratified sampling to avoid bias and ensure samples represent the whole region.
- Stratification mirrors ecological variability: multiple strata defined by combinations of environmental factors (not just simple altitude).
- 1 km square sampling unit chosen as a balance between logistical feasibility and ecological detail.
- Early computing constraints led to a practical approach: classify a subset of squares and assign surrounding squares to classes to create a representative stratification (ITE Land Classification).

## Development of the first ITE Land Classification (CS1978)
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to group 1 km squares into 32 land classes based on environmental attributes.
- Center square of a 15 x 15 km grid was classified, with four surrounding squares also allocated to the class (total of 6039 km squares analyzed for classification map).
- Field sampling: eight samples per land class, totaling 256 squares surveyed.
- National estimates calculated as the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.

## 1984 Survey (CS1984)
- Expanded sampling to 12 km squares per land class (total 384 squares) to better capture variability.
- National estimates still derived using the 1978 Land Classification framework; aims to refine change statistics between 1978 and 1984.

## 1990 Survey (CS1990) and All Squares Land Classification
- Shift from a fixed grid to incorporating data from all 1 km squares in GB; Land Classification revised accordingly.
- Survey expanded to 508 squares; included repeated vegetation quadrats and broader habitat mapping response.
- First Land Cover Map of GB linked to the program; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report (1993).
- CS1990 highlighted limitations of using an older, gridded classification for regional/local estimates; efforts began to classify every square.

## 1990 Land Classification Revised
- Due to computational limits, every GB square could not be classified in full detail; major climatic, geological, and physiographic surrogates were used for classification of all squares.
- Comparisons between the original 1228-square-based classification and the new approach showed about 62% exact correspondence; mismatches generally fell into neighboring classes, preserving overall class characteristics.
- The reclassification affected the distribution of classes and representation, introducing distortions in some strata.

## Developments for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
- Policy-driven needs to report separate country estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland) prompted framework changes.
- Key changes:
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions (creating more classes) and aggregation where necessary to maintain adequate representation within each country (resulting in 40 strata).
  - Additional sample squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes in each country (19 extra in total; plus 11 to balance England/Wales sampling).
  - Wales-specific refinement: sub-division of Land Class 17 to better represent Welsh habitats.
  - Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with new England-based squares.
- An upland module was added to improve in-scope estimates for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Sample counts (England & Wales, Scotland) and overall stratified distribution were adjusted accordingly (extensive tables and maps illustrate the framework and sample distribution).

## Developments for Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
- Wales-only reporting continued to be a priority post-devolution; existing Welsh sampling (64 squares) was insufficient for Wales-only estimates.
- Implemented:
  - Country-unit sub-divisions expanded (five new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Strata increased to 45 due to sub-divisions; additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure minimum representation per Welsh class (minimum 6 per class).
  - England adjustments: no further English expansions; two classes (5e, 15e) left with only 4 squares each, deemed acceptable for English estimates per scoping study.
- Result: revised Land Classification maps for England with Wales and for Scotland; detailed sample counts across classes and regions (CS2007 sample squares summarized in Table 3 and figures).

## Note on National Estimates
- The 2006 scoping study warns that changing the basic Land Classification used for national estimates affects the consistency of stock estimates across surveys.
- For internal consistency with a given survey, the earlier classification may be preferred, but cross-survey comparability benefits from using the latest classification.
- Table 4 presents sample sizes per class under the original 1990 Land Classification for historical comparison.

## Summary of Sampling Progression and Scale
- CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class) across 32 land classes (total classified squares ~6039).
- CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
- CS1990: 508 squares; shift to All Squares Land Classification; inclusion of land-cover mapping via satellite imagery.
- CS2000: 569 squares; country-unit framework established (England with Wales, Scotland); 40 strata; upland module added.
- CS2007: 591 squares; Wales-focused refinements; 45 strata; enhanced Welsh representation; England adjustments limited to maintain comparability.
