# Overview

- This dataset documents a continuous field trial of a decentralised, low-maintenance drinking water treatment system (DWTS) in the UK, implemented as part of a UK-India Water Quality project aimed at sensing and improving water quality for deployment in India.
- The trial ran from November 25, 2019 to February 10, 2020 (11 weeks), with weekly sampling (two campus closure weeks reduced sampling).
- The NINJA drinking water treatment platform (NINJA-DWTP) uses a PAqua 1000D-2 purification unit with ultrafiltration (UF) and electrochemically activated biocidal dosing (PAqualyte ECAS) to produce biologically safe drinking water from highly contaminated raw water.
- Data collection combines high-frequency telemetry (5-minute cadence) for system operating parameters with laboratory-analysed water quality data at three sampling locations, enabling evaluation of treatment performance and compliance with regulatory limits.

## Monitoring framework and data governance context

- The dataset exemplifies an integrated monitoring approach: real-time system telemetry, centralized remote management, and periodic laboratory analysis of water quality.
- It highlights practical data governance and metadata needs for monitoring frameworks, including provenance, data quality assurance, and public sharing of underlying data.
- Data are generated under formal laboratory accreditation (UKAS) and aligned with Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) regulatory parameters, facilitating framework-based evaluation against statutory limits.
- Completeness and consistency vary across parameters and sampling events; some data are missing (NA), and certain parameters were collected as indicators rather than essential measurements.
- Metadata mapping is provided via detailed column definitions and method references, illustrating the importance of clear data dictionaries when building monitoring dashboards and dashboards for policy evaluation.

## System description and monitoring framework

- DWTS configuration:
  - PAqua 1000D-2 purification unit with ECAS disinfectant (PAqualyte) generated by an ECAS generator.
  - 50 µm pre-filter and 0.02 µm ultrafiltration membranes.
  - In-line ORP and free chlorine monitoring with automated rejection to wastewater if thresholds are exceeded.
  - 100 L treated water tank feeding a water-softening stage and backwashing for UF membranes (automatic backwash every 30 minutes; enhanced clean when TMP reaches thresholds).
  - Output water stored in a potable tank for sampling; backwash water directed to drains.
- Ancillary input water treatment to reduce sediment and particulates:
  - Two 1000 L settlement tanks in series.
  - Two Turbidex 5 µm prefilter ionisers to remove particulates.
- Telemetry and remote management:
  - Grundfos Remote Management platform collects data from pumps and inline sensors (s::can, Messtechnik).
  - Key telemetry parameters include flow rate, UF transmembrane pressure (TMP), ORP, and free chlorine.
- Sampling and laboratory analysis:
  - Three sampling locations: raw water (RW), header tank (HT) post-filtration, and potable water (PW) for distribution.
  - Lab analyses conducted by Wessex Water Scientific Centre (UKAS-accredited), following Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) methods.
  - Weekly sampling schedule (with two weeks of campus closure), documented in the trial’s methods and appendix.

## Data collection, telemetry, and quality control

- Telemetry (file 1) provides 5-minute window-averaged and min/max values for:
  - Flow, differential pressure across UF membranes (TMP), ORP, and free chlorine (FCl) in treated water.
- Water quality data (files 2–4) cover a broad set of parameters, including:
  - Microbiological: coliforms, E. coli, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococci, plate counts.
  - Physicochemical and chemical: pH, colour, turbidity, electrical conductivity, hardness, alkalinity, TOC, sulphates, orthophosphate, chlorides, silica, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, various metals and trace contaminants, halogenated organics, pesticides, PAHs, and more.
  - Each parameter is described with units, DWI limits (where applicable), and standard methods.
- Data structure:
  - File 1: 1_DWTS_operational-parameters.csv (11 columns; 5-minute operational metrics and sensor readings).
  - File 2: 2_DWTS_RawWater_data-summary.csv (85 columns; comprehensive raw water quality data).
  - File 3: 3_DWTS_HeaderTank_data-summary.csv (77 columns; header tank quality data).
  - File 4: 4_DWTS_Potable_data-summary.csv (85 columns; potable (final) water quality data).
- Completeness and caveats:
  - Some parameters are not collected at all sampling times; “NA” indicates missing data.
  - The raw data for system operation primarily comes from the Grundfos remote management system; some additional Grundfos data were not used for performance interpretation.
  - The sampling regime is described in detail, including the exact schedule and the two-week closure period.

## Sampling regimes and locations

- Raw water source: modified artificial water body on the University of the West of England campus.
- Three sampling locations:
  - RW: raw water source.
  - HT: header tank, after Turbidex pre-filtration, before PAqua-WPU.
  - PW: potable water, after treatment and into the potable storage line.
- Sampling and analysis:
  - Water samples collected in sterile bottles, delivered to Wessex Water Scientific Centre within four hours; microbiological analyses performed within 24 hours under ISO/IEC 17025 UKAS accreditation.
- Parameter suites and sampling tables:
  - Full suite: comprehensive basic, microbiological, chemical, metals, and hydrocarbons.
  - Standard suite: basic, microbiological, chemical, and basic metals.
  - Basic suite: basic and microbiological parameters.
  - A detailed sampling schedule (Table 1) defines which locations and suites were used at each date.

## Relevance for monitoring framework authors

- Demonstrates integration of high-frequency telemetry with periodic formal lab analyses to monitor system performance and compliance.
- Illustrates the value of tiered parameter sets (Full, Standard, Basic) for scalable monitoring depending on data availability and policy requirements.
- Highlights data governance considerations critical to monitoring frameworks:
  - Data provenance, alignment with regulatory limits, and public sharing considerations.
  - The need for comprehensive metadata and clear data dictionaries to ensure interpretability and reusability.
- Provides a concrete example of end-to-end data workflow from field deployment to laboratory confirmation, useful for designing monitoring dashboards, QA/QC procedures, and data governance policies in similar environmental health monitoring frameworks.
