# Multiplexed shotgun genotyping for rapid and efficient genetic mapping

- Objective: Identify loci contributing to discrimination between males of related species by genotyping female progeny from a D. simulans backcross (F2 from an F1 backcross) in a two-choice mate assay.
- Experimental setup:
  - Flies: adult females (>3 days and <28 days) and males (7–28 days) from D. simulans and D. sechellia.
  - Assay: three test females and three test males (from each species) per trial; monitored for up to four hours or until copulation.
  - Outcome: after the first mating, vials frozen to preserve mating pair; species of copulating male determined by male genitalia.
- Genotyping and data structure:
  - Genotyping method: Multiplexed Shotgun Genotyping (MSG) to obtain genotypes; libraries prepared with standard molecular biology techniques.
  - Library metadata: an ID column that combines library name with a unique barcode.
  - Phenotype encoding: pheno column where 0 = female mated with D. simulans males and 1 = female mated with D. sechellia males.
  - Genomic references: columns specify specific genome locations (D. simulans, Hu et al. 2013; parental genomes A2A2B for D. simulans and D1A1C for D. sechellia).
  - Data processing: genotypes obtained via MSG; thinning of files performed with pull_thin (David Stern's script).
- Quality control and data filtering:
  - Exclusion criteria: individuals with more than 25% ambiguous genotype calls (NA) removed due to low DNA content.
  - Reporting of genotypes: coding BB = sim/sim alleles; BA = sech/sim; NA = data not available.
- Data provenance and references:
  - Data sources and methods tied to Andolfatto et al. 2011 (MSG method) and Hu et al. 2013 (D. simulans genome assembly).
  - Additional context provided by the cited genomes and assembly work.
- Implications for monitoring framework perspectives:
  - Emphasizes meticulous metadata (library IDs, barcodes, phenotype encoding, parental lines) to support traceability and reuse.
  - Highlights the importance of data quality assurance (removing NA-heavy samples, documenting criteria for exclusion).
  - Demonstrates reproducibility through use of established pipelines (MSG, pull_thin) and transparent references.
  - Underlines potential data governance needs: sharing underlying data and ensuring data provenance and versioning are maintained.
