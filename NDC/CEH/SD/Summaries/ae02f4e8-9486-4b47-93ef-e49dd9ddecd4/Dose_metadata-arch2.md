# A 'Reference Site' in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: radionuclide and stable element data, and estimated dose rates

## Overview
- Metadata for a dataset from a reference site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, focusing on radionuclide and stable element data and estimated dose rates.
- Source: NERC Environmental Information Data Centre; includes a DOI for traceability.
- Aimed at standardised, time-consistent presentation to support environmental health and policy performance assessment.

## Data files and structure
- Files included: Biota_external_dose.csv, Biota_internal_dose.csv, Biota_total_dose.csv, Biota_total_dose_per_radionuclide.csv.
- Core concepts:
  - Radionuclide examined: Cs-137, Sr-90, Am-240, Pu-239, Pu-240, Pu-238.
  - Dose-rate data presented for external exposure (External_Dose_Rate_microGy_h-1) with statistical summaries.
  - Statistical data provided: Mean, Variance, 5th and 95th Percentiles, Median, Minimum, Maximum, 25th and 75th Percentiles.
  - Units: microGray per hour (μGy h-1).

## Biota and taxa covered
- Species and groups represented in the dataset:
  - Pinus sylvestris (pine tree)
  - Agrostis gigantea (grass)
  - Lumbricus terrestris (earthworm)
  - Apodemus agrarius (mouse)
  - Sorex araneus (shrew)
  - Sorex minutus (shrew)
  - Apodemus flavicollis (mouse)
  - Microtus agrestris and Microtus spp. (mouse)
  - Muscardinus avellanarius (doormouse)
  - Myodes glareolus (vole)
  - Bombina bombina (toad)
  - Bufo bufo (toad)
  - Pelobates fuscus (toad)
  - Rana arvalis (frog)
  - Bombus and Xylocopa spp. (bee)

## Dose rate metrics
- External dose-rate data: microGy h-1 with detailed statistical summaries.
- Data likely intended to support cross-species comparisons and regulatory or policy assessments of environmental radiological health.

## Data quality and standardisation
- Metadata includes clear explanations of column headers and units, enabling consistent interpretation.
- Data are produced and stored following standardised approaches and quality assurance practices typical of environmental monitoring datasets.
- Outputs are designed for clear presentation in reports, maps, and charts, with datasets stored and uploaded to the appropriate portals.

## Uses for environmental monitoring
- Enables consistent monitoring of environmental health over time through comparable dose-rate metrics.
- Facilitates trend analysis, spatial mapping, and cross-species exposure assessments for radiological risk.
- Supports evaluation of policy performance related to radiological contamination in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.

## Accessibility and data sharing
- Datasets are prepared for sharing via established data portals; underlying data are intended to be accessible to those using the final outputs.
- Emphasises the importance of enabling access to underlying data used to generate final reports and visuals.

## Challenges and opportunities for Analysts
- Challenge: increase the value of these datasets by integrating with other relevant data sources for broader analyses beyond single-use outputs.
- Opportunity: improve accessibility to underlying data to empower re-use, re-analysis, and alternative presentations of the information.
