# A 'Reference Site' in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: radionuclide and stable element data, and estimated dose rates

- Purpose and scope
  - Document materials and methods for establishing a reference site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone with radionuclide and stable element data and estimated dose rates.
  - Emphasizes comprehensive sampling across multiple taxa and environments to support wildlife dose assessments.

- 2.1 Sample Site
  - 0.4 km² site on the western edge of the Red Forest, ~5 km from Chernobyl Unit 4.
  - Excluded areas with extreme 1986 exposure effects; inner sampling area (~0.06 km²) within former kitchen gardens.
  - Dominant soils: soddy-podzolic sandy loam; surrounding habitats: deciduous woodland and marsh.

- 2.2 Sampling overview
  - Conducted May/June 2014; focused on ICRP Reference Animal and Plant (RAP) definitions; additional species analyzed for 90Sr and 137Cs.

- 2.2.1 Wild grass
  - Agrostis gigantea sampled on a grid, approximately 1 cm above ground; air-dried and homogenised.

- 2.2.2 Pine Tree
  - Trunk wood from three mature trees (>28 years old) and samples of needles, cones, and branches; wood used for RAP geometry; samples dried and homogenised.

- 2.2.3 Earthworm
  - Eisenia-type worms from six inner-area sites; gut evacuation to separate soil; sub-samples for radiochemical and stable element analyses.

- 2.2.4 Bees and other insects
  - Pan traps (water-filled) used to collect bees (Xylocopa spp., Bombus spp.); other taxa collected and stored for analyses; bees analysed for stable elements.

- 2.2.5 Small mammals
  - Sherman live traps over five nights; 166 animals of seven species captured; mass, sex, age recorded; most released; Apodemus flavicollis captured for euthanasia and tissue sampling; other species sampled where feasible.

- 2.2.6 Amphibians
  - Hand collection supplemented by fences; moor frog, European fire-bellied toad, European toad, common spadefoot toad; mass recorded; most released; nine Rana arvalis ashed for radiochemical analyses; select tissues and organs sampled from specific individuals.

- 2.2.7 Soils
  - Fifteen 10 cm cores per tree around selected pines; soils dried and homogenised; ambient dose rates measured in the field.

- 2.3 Live-monitoring
  - 118 animals monitored in vivo for whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr using a lead-shielded counting container with HPGe and NaI detectors.
  - Counting times 150–1200 s; typical errors: <3% for 90Sr and <7% for 137Cs.
  - Data used to derive internal dose rates and compare across species.

- 2.4 Radioanalyses
  - General approach to quantify 90Sr and 137Cs in matrices; gamma spectrometry for Cs-137; radiochemical methods for Sr-90.
  - Alpha spectrometry for actinides (Pu and Am) with tracers (242Pu, 243Am) and complex chemical separations.
  - Calibration and validation against standard sources; uncertainties typically within stated ranges.

- 2.5 Stabilised and elemental analyses
  - 65% HNO3 digestion for most samples; HF digestion for silicate-rich soils; organics pre-digestion when needed.
  - ICP-MS (iCAP-Q) used for 29 elements with multiple cell modes (He-cell, STD, H2-cell) to manage interferences.
  - Internal standards (Ge, Rh, Ir) added; external calibration with standard reference materials (NIST CRMs).
  - Quality control: recoveries generally within 100 ± 15% for tomato leaves and bovine liver CRMs; soil CRM recoveries within 100 ± 25%.

- 2.5.1 Extractions (soil, plant, animal)
  - Soil digestions: multi-acid approach (HNO3, HF, HClO4) with stepped heating; post-digestion dilution.
  - Plant digestions: HNO3 with microwave digestion; QC with NIST CRMs.
  - Animal tissues: HNO3 + H2O2 digestion; QC with CRMs; thorough dissolution achieved except for some earthworms.

- 2.5.2 Analyses
  - ICP-MS across three modes; primary elements listed; detection limits based on blanks.
  - Data processed with Qtegra software; in-sample switching for different elements as required.

- 2.6 Dose assessment
  - Tier 3 (probabilistic) ERICA Tool (version 1.2.1) used to estimate total exposure for wildlife.
  - External exposure: soil activity concentrations used with assumed soil dry matter content and lognormal distributions.
  - Internal exposure: organism-specific activity concentrations (fresh mass basis) used; Pu/Am contributions treated as 50/50 where data exist; otherwise values inferred from similar species.
  - Species-specific geometry and occupancy factors built in ERICA for small mammals, amphibians, bees; default geometries used for earthworms and plants.
  - Radiation weighting factors: 10 for alpha, 3 for low-energy beta, 1 for others.

- Data quality and integration
  - Use of degraded data management and robust QA via certified reference materials and cross-validation against established methods.
  - Comprehensive, multi-taxa dataset designed to support transfer parameter work, dose modelling, and inter-comparisons within wildlife radiological assessment frameworks.

- Context and references
  - Builds on ERICA Tool lineage and ICRP reference species frameworks; includes extensive citations to related field studies, methodological papers, and standard reference materials to support transfer and dose calculations.
