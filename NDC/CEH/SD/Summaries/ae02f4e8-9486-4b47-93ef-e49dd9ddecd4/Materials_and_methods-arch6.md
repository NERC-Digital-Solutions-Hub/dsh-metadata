# Materials and methods for: A 'Reference Site' in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: radionuclide and stable element data, and estimated dose rates

- Objective and scope
  - Present a dataset of radionuclide and stable element concentrations and estimated dose rates for wildlife and environment within a Chernobyl reference site.
  - Support transfer and dose–rate assessments using established models (e.g., ERICA Tool).

- Study area and sampling period
  - Location: western edge of the Red Forest, ~5 km WSW of Chernobyl Unit 4; inner sampling area (~0.06 km2) within former kitchen gardens.
  - Soils and habitats: soddy-podzolic sandy loam; surrounding deciduous woodland and marsh.
  - Sampling window: May–June 2014 (focused on ICRP RAP-defined species; additional species analyzed for 90Sr and 137Cs); frogspawn collected in early 2015.
  - Site size and sampling density: area around sampled Pinus sylvestris trees with 15 soil cores per tree site and 28 soil samples in total; multiple taxa sampled across the inner area.

- Target organisms and sample types
  - Wild grass: Agrostis gigantea (blanks bent grass) sampled on a grid from inner area; air-dried and homogenised.
  - Pine trees: trunk wood from three trees (>28 years old) plus needles, cones, and branches; dried and homogenised.
  - Earthworms: Eisenia spp. from six inner sites; gut evacuation and preparation for radiochemical and stable element analyses.
  - Bees and other insects: Xylocopa spp. and Bombus spp. (I CRP RAP definitions); pan traps and subsequent taxonomic separation; bees analysed for stable elements.
  - Small mammals: Apodemus agrarius, Myodes glareolous (most abundant); others captured and processed; some A. flavicollis euthanised for radiochemical analyses.
  - Amphibians: Rana arvalis, Bombina bombina, Bufo bufo, Pelobates fuscus; live-monitored or dissected for tissue analyses; frogspawn collected.
  - Soils: 10 cm cores around each sampled pine; 28 total soils; ambient dose rate measured at 1 m height above ground.

- Analytical methods for radionuclides and elements
  - Radionuclide activity concentrations
    - 137Cs: gamma spectroscopy (HPGe detector).
    - 90Sr: beta spectrometry; in some samples via live-counting of animals or soil/biota without radiochemical pretreatment.
    - Actinides (Pu isotopes and 241Am): radiochemical separation (anion exchange, TRU resin) after acid digestion; alpha spectrometry for separated fractions.
  - Stable elements and iodine
    - ICP-MS: multi-element analysis with various cell modes (He-cell, STD, H2-cell) to reduce interferences; internal standards used; external calibration with multiple CRM materials.
    - Iodine: stable iodine concentrations determined by alkaline extraction (TMAH) or acidic digestion when sample size limited.
  - Sample preparation and quality control
    - Digestions: soils (HNO3/HF/HClO4 digestion with high-temperature digestion), plants (microwave-assisted HNO3 digestion), animal tissues (HNO3/H2O2 digestion).
    - CRM materials for QA: NIST SRMs (2711a Montana soil, 1573a Tomato Leaves, 1577c Bovine Liver); recoveries generally 100 ± 15–25%.
    - Uncertainty and detection limits: Cs: ~10–15%; Sr: ~20%; alpha isotopes: typical 20% for Pu/Am; detection limits per instrument and sample type.

- Dose assessment approach
  - Tool: ERICA Tool (version 1.2.1) Tier 3 probabilistic assessment.
  - Inputs: activity concentrations in soil, trunk wood, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates; occupancy factors and default geometries for each species.
  - Species coverage and geometry
    - Small mammals and amphibians: species-specific geometries based on measured masses; occupancy in soil, on soil, or in air.
    - Bees, earthworms, and plants: default ERICA geometries.
  - Isotope assumptions
    - 239,240Pu treated as total Pu with equal contributions; for species lacking data for Am or Pu, values imputed from similar species.
  - Outputs used for exposure estimation: external exposure rates and total dose rates for each species, enabling cross-species comparison.

- Data quality, interoperability, and access
  - Calibration and method validation
    - Methods calibrated against phantoms and cross-validated with radiochemical techniques; multifaceted QA using standard reference materials.
  - Metadata and reproducibility
    - Detailed sampling, preparation, and analysis protocols provided; data designed for integration into wildlife transfer databases and dose assessment frameworks.
  - Data availability
    - Part of a broader data Centre; linked to NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) with dataset references and DOIs in related publications.

- Practical outputs for data use
  - Datasets of radionuclide activities (137Cs, 90Sr, Pu, Am) across multiple taxa and soils.
  - Stable element concentrations across plants, invertebrates, mammals, and amphibians.
  - Dose-rate estimates for wildlife using ERICA Tool inputs, enabling risk assessment and cross-site comparisons.
  - Potential data products: exposure maps, transfer parameter datasets, dashboards for self-service exploration, and inputs for ecological risk modeling.
