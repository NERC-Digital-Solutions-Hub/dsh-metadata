# A 'Reference Site' in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: radionuclide and stable element data, and estimated dose rates

## Overview
- Metadata description for a reference site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone focusing on radionuclide and stable element data and estimated dose rates.
- Source: NERC Environmental Information Data Centre; includes a DOI.
- Files accompany the metadata: Biota_external_dose.csv, Biota_internal_dose.csv, Biota_total_dose.csv, Biota_total_dose_per_radionuclide.csv.

## Data files and structure
- Files and their focus:
  - Biota_external_dose.csv
  - Biota_internal_dose.csv
  - Biota_total_dose.csv
  - Biota_total_dose_per_radionuclide.csv
- Common structure elements:
  - Radionuclide column with: Cs-137, Sr-90, Am-240, Pu-239, Pu-240 or Pu-238.
  - External_Dose_Rate_microGy_h-1 as the dose rate metric (microGray per hour).
  - Statistical descriptors for external dose rate: Mean, Variance, 5th Percentile, 95th Percentile, Median, Minimum, Maximum, 25th Percentile, 75th Percentile.
- Units and headings are explicitly defined to support analysis and reproducibility.

## Radionuclides and dose metrics
- Radionuclides covered: Cs-137, Sr-90, Am-240, Pu-239, Pu-240 or Pu-238.
- Dose rate data described at multiple levels:
  - External dose rate (microGy/h) with comprehensive summary statistics.
  - Datasets include per-radionuclide and total dose rate information.

## Biota coverage (taxa and samples)
- Species and groups included:
  - Pinus sylvestris (pine)
  - Agrostis gigantea (grass)
  - Lumbricus terrestris (earthworm)
  - Apodemus agrarius (mouse)
  - Sorex araneus (shrew)
  - Sorex minutus (shrew)
  - Apodemus flavicollis (mouse)
  - Microtus agrestris and Microtus spp. (mouse/voles)
  - Muscardinus avellanarius (doormouse)
  - Myodes glareolus (vole)
  - Bombina bombina (toad)
  - Bufo bufo (toad)
  - Pelobates fuscus (toad)
  - Rana arvalis (frog)
  - Bombus and Xylocopa spp. (bee)
- Indicates a broad range of flora and fauna sampled for dose assessment.

## How analysts can use the data
- Identify correlations between specific radionuclides and dose rates across diverse biota.
- Compare external vs. internal vs. total dose rates, and decompose totals by radionuclide.
- Develop predictive models of dose exposure for different taxa at the reference site.
- Support dose reconstruction, risk assessment, and environmental monitoring studies in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.

## Data quality, provenance, and accessibility
- Metadata provides clear explanations of column headings and units to enable correct interpretation.
- Datasets are structured to facilitate data discovery, reuse, and potential public portal upload with metadata.
- Emphasis on traceability of data sources and reproducibility of analyses.
