## Data governance and accessibility
- Data described through column headings and units, enhancing discoverability and reuse.
- File formats: CSV; accompanying metadata explains each column (Radionuclide, Dose Rate, species, etc.).
- Source dataset resides in the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre; DOI available for reference.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Illustrates end-to-end data stewardship: clear variable definitions, unit specifications, and structured file organization across multiple related datasets.
- Supports evaluating data coverage across radionuclides, dose-rate components (external/internal/total), and diverse biota, enabling cross-species risk assessment and prioritization.
- Demonstrates the need for comprehensive metadata to aid data discovery, interoperability, and reuse across networks and partners.
- Highlights considerations for data quality, standardization, and documentation to facilitate collaboration and avoid data duplication.
