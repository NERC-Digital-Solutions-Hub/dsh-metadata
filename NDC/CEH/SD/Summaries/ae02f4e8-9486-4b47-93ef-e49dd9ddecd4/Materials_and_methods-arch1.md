# A 'Reference Site' in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: radionuclide and stable element data, and estimated dose rates

- Purpose: describe materials, sampling, analytics, and dose-rate estimation for a reference site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone to support wildlife radiological assessments.
- Core data types: radionuclide concentrations (137Cs, 90Sr, actinides), stable element concentrations, and estimated external/internal dose rates for wildlife.

## Study Site and Sampling Design

- Location: sampling site (0.4 km2) on the western edge of the Red Forest, about 5 km west-southwest of Chernobyl Unit 4.
- Context: not within areas where pine trees were killed by high exposure in 1986; inner sampling area (~0.06 km2) comprised former kitchen gardens (dacha) with fruit trees.
- Soils and surroundings: predominant soddy-podzolic sandy loam soil; surrounding habitats were largely deciduous woodland and marsh.
- Sampling period: May/June 2014; focused on ICRP Reference Animals and Plants (RAP) definitions, with additional species analysed for 90Sr and 137Cs.

## Sampling and Sample Types

- Wild grass: Agrostis gigantea sampled on a grid; 1 cm above ground, air-dried, homogenised.
- Pine trees: trunk wood from three >28-year-old trees; samples of needles, cones, branches; dried and homogenised.
- Earthworms: collected from six inner-area sites; gut contents evacuated; sub-samples for radiochemical and stable-element analyses.
- Bees and other insects: 12 pan traps; bees (Xylocopa spp., Bombus spp.) analysed for stable elements; other insects collected and stored.
- Small mammals: 166 animals of seven species; majority Apodemus agrarius and Myodes glareolous; nine Apodemus flavicollis euthanised for radiochemical analyses; other tissues dissected and stored.
- Amphibians: fence and hand-catching; species include Rana arvalis, Bombina bombina, Bufo bufo, Pelobates fuscus; mass recorded; most released; Rana arvalis sampled ashed for radiochemical analyses.
- Frogspawn: mass collected from flooded bog and freeze-dried for stable-element analyses.
- Soils: 15 soil cores per sampled tree area plus additional sites; ambient dose rate measured at 1 m height; 28 soil samples total; soils and bulks digested for analysis.

## Live Monitoring and Measurements

- Live-monitored animals: 118 total (e.g., 37 A. agrarius, 24 M. glareolous, 12 R. arvalis).
- Whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr measured in vivo using a shielding setup with HPGe gamma detector (137Cs) and a thin-film NaI detector (90Sr via 90Y).
- Counting times: 150–1200 s; typical counting uncertainties <3% for 90Sr and <7% for 137Cs.

## Radioanalytical Methods

- 137Cs: gamma-spectrometry (HPGe detector) with standard calibration, detection limits ~0.18 Bq per sample.
- 90Sr: beta-spectrometry without radiochemical pretreatment; calibrations against standards and background.
- Actinides (Pu, Am): in-depth radiochemical separation after acid digestions; alpha-spectrometry; use of 242Pu/243Am yield tracers; typical alpha-counting uncertainties <20%.
- Sample preparation: homogenisation of solids; 10 g dry mass aliquots for radiochemical analyses; soils require HF digestion; plant and animal digestions with HNO3 and H2O2.
- Stable-element analyses: multi-element determinations by ICP-MS; use of internal standards; quality control with NIST CRMs (SRM 2711a, 1573a, 1577c).

## Extractions and Analytical QA

- Extractions: detailed acid digestion protocols for soils, plants, and animal tissues; microwave digestion for plant and animal matrices; HF/HNO3 digestion for soils.
- QA: recoveries evaluated against NIST SRMs; typical recoveries within expected ranges (e.g., 100 ± 15–25% for major CRMs); blanks and standards run with each batch to ensure accuracy.

## Elemental Analyses

- ICP-MS analyses conducted in three modes (He-cell, STD, H2-cell) to address interferences; internal standards added (Ge, Rh, Ir).
- Elements measured: Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, S, Se, Sr, Tl, U, V, Zn; detection limits based on reagent blanks.
- Data processing: external calibration with standard solutions; in-sample switching for select elements as appropriate.

## Dose Assessment

- Method: Tier 3 probabilistic dose assessment using the ERICA Tool (version 1.2.1).
- Inputs: site-specific mean and SD values for each species; assumed lognormal distributions; soil external exposure based on bulk soil activity; trunk wood concentration for P. sylvestris.
- Species geometries: defined in ERICA Tool for small mammals and amphibians; default geometries for bees, earthworms, and plants.
- Occupancy factors: derived from literature and supplementary information; amphibians assumed 100% terrestrial.
- Pu/Am: total 239,240Pu activity treated as 50% each when data available; otherwise values from related species were used for missing data.
- Output: combined external and internal dose-rate estimates for wildlife within the reference site.

## Data Sources and Standards

- Grounded in established references and methodologies for radiation dose assessment to wildlife (ICRP RAP, ERICA Tool, IAEA manuals).
- Use of international reference materials and cross-validation against prior field studies in Chernobyl and other ecosystems.

## Implications for Data Use

- Provides a comprehensive, multi-taxa dataset of radionuclide and stable-element concentrations linked to estimated dose rates for wildlife at a field reference site.
- Data collection methods and QA steps designed to support cross-study comparability and potential integration into broader ecological radiological assessments.
- The approach demonstrates how to combine field sampling, in vivo measurements, laboratory radiochemical analyses, and dose-modeling to quantify environmental radiation exposure.
