# A 'Reference Site' in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: radionuclide and stable element data, and estimated dose rates

- Overview
  - Comprehensive field study focused on radionuclide and stable element concentrations across multiple biota and soils in a Western edge area of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, near the Red Forest.
  - Aimed to provide data for ICRP Reference Animals and Plants and related biota, with estimated dose rates using ERICA Tool (Tier 3 probabilistic assessment).
  - Sampling conducted in May–June 2014; inner sampling area centered on former kitchen gardens and fruit trees within soddy-podzolic sandy loam soils and adjacent habitats.

- Site and Habitat
  - Inner sampling area ≈ 0.06 km2 within a 0.4 km2 sampling site.
  - Predominant soil: soddy-podzolic sandy loam; surrounding deciduous woodland and marsh.
  - Not within the area of pine-tree kill from the 1986 accident; samples collected from trees, soils, grasses, invertebrates, amphibians, small mammals, and birds/bees.

- Sampling Plan and Timeline
  - Targeted ICRP RAP species; collected additional species for 90Sr and 137Cs analyses.
  - Sampling period: about one month in May/June 2014, with supplementary frogspawn collected in April 2015.
  - Sample types and collection methods included: wild grass, pine trunk/needles/cones/branches, earthworms, bees and other insects, small mammals, amphibians, soils, and frogspawn.

- Sampling Details by Organism/Media
  - Wild grass: Agrostis gigantea collected on a grid; dried and homogenised for analysis.
  - Pine trees: trunk wood from three felled trees (>28 years old, predating 1986); samples from needles, cones, branches; dried and homogenised.
  - Earthworms: collected from under old fruit trees; gut contents evacuated; sub-samples for radiochemical and stable-element analyses.
  - Bees and insects: Pan traps with dye; mainly Apidae (Xylocopa and Bombus) analysed for stable elements; other insects stored for potential analyses.
  - Small mammals: Sherman live traps; 166 animals of seven species captured; mass, sex, approximate age recorded; A. flavicollis euthanised and analysed for radiochemical and stable-element content; others released.
  - Amphibians: hand-collected and pit-trapped; mass recorded; most released; nine Rana arvalis ashed for radiochemical analyses; some dissected for tissue samples.
  - Soils: 15 soil cores per tree area plus additional sites; bulked per tree and 28 samples total; ambient dose rates measured at 1 m height; soils dried and homogenised.

- Live-Monitoring and In Vivo Measurements
  - 118 animals were live-monitored for whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr concentrations using in vivo counting with a dual detector system (HPGe for 137Cs, NaI for 90Sr via 90Y daughter).
  - Counting times varied (150–1200 s); counting errors typically <3% for 90Sr and <7% for 137Cs.

- Radioanalyses and Stable Element Analyses
  - 137Cs: gamma-spectrometry (HPGe detector) with 152Eu calibration; minimum detectable activity ~0.18 Bq per sample; typical uncertainties ~10–15%.
  - 90Sr: beta-spectrometry without radiochemical pretreatment; calibration with standard mixtures; uncertainties ~20%.
  - Actinides (Pu isotopes and 241Am): chemical separation (anions, TRU resin) after digestion (HNO3, HF, HClO4) and alpha spectrometry; typical alpha-counting uncertainties <20%.
  - Stable elements: 29 elements measured by ICP-MS (iCAP-Q) with multiple cell modes (He, STD, H2) to mitigate interferences; use of internal standards and external calibrants; detection limits based on blanks.
  - Iodine (stable): iodine concentrations determined by ICP-MS after alkaline extraction (TMAH) or, when sample limited, acidic digestion was prioritized; stable iodine data alongside radiocaesium/radiostrontium.

- Extractions, Digestions, and Quality Control
  - Soil digestions: strong acid digestion (HNO3, HF, HClO4) with final dilution; NIST SRMs used for QA (Montana soil); recoveries generally within 100 ± 15–25% across soils, plants, and animal tissues.
  - Plant digestions: HNO3 with microwave-assisted digestion; QA with NIST SRMs (Tomato Leaves).
  - Animal tissue digestions: HNO3 + H2O2 with microwave digestion; QA with NIST bovine liver CRM.
  - Overall QA: satisfactory recoveries for CRMs; element recovery within expected ranges for the majority of tested elements.

- Dose Assessment
  - Used ERICA Tool (Tier 3 probabilistic) version 1.2.1 to estimate total exposure for wildlife.
  - Input parameters:
    - External exposure from soil concentrations using arithmetic means and lognormal distributions.
    - Internal exposure from organism concentrations using fresh mass data and species-specific occupancy assumptions.
    - For P. sylvestris, trunk wood activity used for ERICA geometry.
    - Averaged data for Apidae bees and Microtus voles; Pu and Am treated as 50/50 in dose calculations where data permitted; otherwise, substitute from similar species.
    - Insects analysed only within ICRP Reference Bee definition; amphibians and other taxa modeled with appropriate geometries and occupancy patterns.
  - Species-specific factors:
    - Geometries based on measured masses and literature; occupancy factors derived from available data; amphibians assumed to spend 100% of time on land.
    - Radiation weighting factors: alpha = 10, low-energy beta = 3, beta/gamma = 1.

- Data Scope and Outputs
  - Generated multi-taxa radionuclide concentration data (e.g., 137Cs, 90Sr) and stable-element concentrations across soils, flora, invertebrates, amphibians, and mammals.
  - Provided dose-rate estimates for wildlife in the reference site context, enabling comparisons with ERICA benchmarks and other reference sites.

- References and Methodological Context
  - Build upon established references for sampling, radioecology, and the ERICA framework.
  - Included extensive methodological citations for sampling, radiochemical analyses, and dose modeling to situate outputs within the ICRP and ERICA tool literature.
