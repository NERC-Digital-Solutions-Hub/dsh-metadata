# A 'Reference Site' in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: radionuclide and stable element data, and estimated dose rates

- Purpose and scope
  - Reports materials and methods for collecting and analysing radionuclide and stable element data, and estimating dose rates for a designated reference site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
  - Data cover wildlife (various taxa), soils, and environmental media; intended for field- and lab-generated datasets to support reference-ecosystem assessments and cross-site comparisons.
  - Dose rates estimated using the ERICA Tool (Tier 3 probabilistic assessment) with site- and species-specific inputs.

- 2.1 Sample Site
  - Study area: ~0.4 km² at the western edge of the Red Forest, ~5 km WSW of Chernobyl Unit 4; inner sampling area ~0.06 km² used for detailed biological sampling.
  - Dominant soils: soddy-podzolic sandy loam; surrounding habitats include deciduous woodland and marsh.
  - Sampling focus included species aligned with ICRP Reference Animals and Plants (RAP) definitions; certain additional species tested for 90Sr and 137Cs.

- 2.2 Sampling
  - Timeframe: all samples collected over about one month (May/June 2014); frogspawn collected April 2015.
  - Sampling pattern: grid-based for several taxa; additional species captured for radiocaesium and radiostrontium analyses.
  - 2.2.1 Wild grass
    - Agrostis gigantea sampled on a grid within inner area; samples dried, homogenised for analyses.
  - 2.2.2 Pine Tree
    - Pinus sylvestris trunk wood from three trees (>28 years old), plus needles, cones, branches; samples dried and homogenised.
  - 2.2.3 Earthworm
    - Lumbricidae (likely Eisenia hortensis) from six inner-area sites; gut evacuation, split sub-samples for radiochemical analyses and stable-element analyses after freeze-drying.
  - 2.2.4 Bees and other insects
    - Pan-trap collection of bees (Xylocopa spp., Bombus spp.) and other insects; samples stored frozen and later dried for stable-element analyses (bees analysed for stable elements only).
  - 2.2.5 Small mammals
    - Sherman traps over five nights; 166 individuals from seven species; mass, sex, age recorded; majority released; nine Apodemus flavicollis euthanised for radiochemical analyses; tissues collected for stable-element analyses.
  - 2.2.6 Amphibians
    - Moor frog, European fire-bellied toad, European toad, common spadefoot toad; mass recorded; most released; nine R. arvalis ashed for radiochemical analyses; frogspawn collected and freeze-dried for stable-element analyses.
  - 2.2.7 Soils
    - 15 soil cores per sampled pine tree; total 28 soils sampled; bulked per tree; ambient dose rates measured; soils dried and homogenised for analyses.
  - General sampling notes
    - Each sample type processed to determine 137Cs and 90Sr activities; actinides measured in select samples; stable elements also analysed on selected bulks and samples.

- 2.3 Live-monitoring
  - 118 animals live-monitored (species within ICRP Rat and Frog RAP definitions).
  - Whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr measured in vivo using a shielded counting setup with a germanium detector (Cs) and a thin-film NaI detector (Sr), following validated protocols.
  - Counting times and calibration targeted to achieve typical errors <3% for 90Sr and <7% for 137Cs.

- 2.4 Radioanalyses
  - For non-live-monitored samples or additional material: radiocaesium (Cs-137) via gamma spectroscopy; Sr-90 via beta spectroscopy without radiochemical pretreatment for many samples.
  - Actinide analyses (Pu, Am) using isotope tracers (242Pu, 243Am); samples digested with strong acids, separated via ion-exchange/resin methods, and measured with alpha spectrometry.
  - Stable-element and iodine analyses performed via ICP-MS and specialized iodine extraction (alkaline or acidic digestions as appropriate); quality control with standard reference materials.
  - Uncertainties and detection limits explicitly reported for each method and element where applicable.

- 2.5 Extractions and 2.5.2 Analyses
  - 2.5.1 Extractions
    - Soil, plant, and animal tissues digested with appropriate acid mixtures (HNO3, HF, HClO4; microwave digestion for plants; HNO3/H2O2 for animal tissue).
    - QA with NIST standard reference materials (e.g., SRM 2711a Montana soil, NIST 1573a Tomato Leaves, NIST 1577c Bovine Liver); recovery tracking within typical certified ranges.
  - 2.5.2 Analyses
    - Multi-element ICP-MS (ICP-MS iCAP-Q) with multiple collision/reaction modes (He-cell, STD, H2-cell) and internal standards.
    - External calibration with multi-element standards; detection limits based on reagent blanks; 29 elements targeted (Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, S, Se, Sr, Tl, U, V, Zn).
    - Data processing with cross-calibrations; acquisition settings tailored per element and matrix.

- 2.6 Dose assessment
  - ERICA Tool (Tier 3 probabilistic assessment) used to estimate total exposure for studied organisms.
  - Inputs:
    - External exposure from mean soil activity concentrations; assumed 100% soil dry mass for certain calculations with lognormal distributions.
    - Organism-specific inputs: mass-based geometry for small mammals and amphibians; default ERICA geometries for bees, earthworms, and plants.
    - Occupancy factors (time spent in soil, on soil, or in air) derived from supplementary information; amphibians assumed 100% terrestrial.
    - Radiation weighting factors (alpha=10, low-energy beta=3, other beta/gamma=1).
  - Specific assumptions:
    - 239,240Pu treated as 50% of total activity for dose calculations; sharing of AmPu data across species when not all isotopes measured.
    - Bee and Microtus species data averaged and used for respective dose assessments.
  - Outputs: site- and species-specific external dose rates; used to contextualise ecological risk.

- Data governance and provenance notes relevant to data stewards
  - Data are generated from a defined reference site with clear spatial boundaries, sampling designs, and species coverage, enabling cross-site comparability.
  - Methodological transparency:
    - Detailed protocols for sampling, preparation, and analyses (including QA with certified reference materials and documented detection limits).
    - In vivo and in vitro radiometric techniques with calibration and error estimates documented.
  - Data products and sharing
    - Describes both radionuclide concentrations and stable-element data across multiple media and taxa, suitable for deposition in environmental data centres.
    - References to data centre deposition (NERC Environmental Information Data Centre) and standardized references (ICRP RAPs, ERICA Tool references) support interoperability and reuse.
  - Standards and interoperability
    - Use of internationally recognized reference materials (NIST SRMs) and standard analytical methods (gamma spectrometry, beta spectrometry, ICP-MS, alpha spectrometry).
    - Clear units, detection limits, and uncertainties facilitate data integration into broader radiological risk assessments.
  - Temporal and archival considerations
    - Sampling occurred in 2014 with frogspawn in 2015; documentation of sampling windows supports longitudinal or comparative analyses.
    - Comprehensive metadata potential (sample IDs, species, tissue type, location, date, analytical method) supports traceability and re-use.
