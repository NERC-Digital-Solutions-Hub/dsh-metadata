# A 'Reference Site' in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: radionuclide and stable element data, and estimated dose rates

- Purpose and scope: A comprehensive dataset from a 0.4 km2 sampling site in the western Red Forest of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, focusing on radionuclide and stable element concentrations and estimated dose rates. The study prioritises organisms defined by ICRP Reference Animals and Plants (RAP) with additional species analysed for 90Sr and 137Cs.
- Sampling period: Approximately one month in May/June 2014 for most samples; frogspawn collected in early April 2015.
- Study area context: Inner sampling area (~0.06 km2) within former kitchen gardens; surrounding habitats include soddy-podzolic sandy loam soils and deciduous woodland.

## Data assets and sample types

- Wild grass: Agrostis gigantea collected on a grid; samples air-dried and homogenised.
- Pine tree: Trunk wood from three mature trees (>28 years); samples include needles, cones, branches; dried and homogenised.
- Earthworms: Collected from six inner-area sites; gut evacuation and freeze-dried for stable element analyses.
- Bees and other insects: Bees collected with pan traps; focus on Apidae (Xylocopa spp., Bombus spp.); other insects also collected for potential analyses.
- Small mammals: Trapped within the inner area; 166 animals across seven species; mass, sex, age recorded; selective euthanasia or release for radiochemical analyses.
- Amphibians: Moor frog, European fire-bellied toad, European toad, common spadefoot toad; live-monitored with select tissues taken from some individuals.
- Frogspawn: Collected and freeze-dried for stable element analyses.
- Soils: 28 samples around sampled pines and animal traps; ambient dose rate measured at 1 m height; soils dried and homogenised.
- Analyte scope: 137Cs and 90Sr activity concentrations; actinides (241Am, Pu isotopes) in specific samples; stable element concentrations including iodine (I) via multiple extraction methods.

## Methods and processing

- Live monitoring: 118 animals assessed for whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr using in vivo methods (lead-shielded boxes with HPGe and NaI detectors); counting times 150–1200 s; typical uncertainties ~3% (90Sr) and ~7% (137Cs).
- Radioanalyses and sample preparation:
  - Homogenisation of samples; gamma spectrometry for Cs-137; beta spectrometry for Sr-90 via 90Y daughter.
  - Actinide analyses: digestion, anion-exchange separation, alpha spectrometry for Pu isotopes; Am isolated and measured; use of tracers 242Pu and 243Am for yield tracking.
  - Stable element determinations: digestion procedures for soils, plants, and animals; ICP-MS with multiple cell modes (He-cell, STD, H2-cell) and internal standards; external calibration with multiple CRM materials.
  - Iodine determinations: alkaline extraction with TMAH and, where possible, acidic digestions; thyroid tissue prioritized for TMAH.
- Extractions and quality control:
  - Soil, plant, and animal digestions validated with CRM materials (NIST SRM 2711a, 1573a, 1577c); recoveries generally within 100 ± 15% for most elements; ICP-MS recovery performance within expected ranges.
  - Detection limits and uncertainties established per sample type; method references provided for calibration and QA.

## Dose assessment and modelling

- Tool and approach: ERICA Tool (version 1.2.1), Tier 3 probabilistic assessment, to estimate total exposure for wildlife.
- Inputs and geometry:
  - External exposure based on mean soil activity concentrations with assumed 100% dry matter content and lognormal distribution.
  - Habitat- and species-specific inputs: masses and dimensions from field data and literature; occupancy factors (soil, ground, air) derived per species; amphibians assumed terrestrial 100% of time.
  - Reference radiological components: Cs-137, Sr-90, and Pu/Am isotopes with equal weighting when data are unavailable; bee and small mammal dose assessments aligned to RAP definitions.
- Outputs: Combined dose rate estimates for the wildlife assemblage at the site, enabling inter-study comparisons and model validations.

## Data quality, standards, and documentation

- Quality assurance:
  - Use of certified reference materials for method validation; recovery rates typically within acceptable ranges (e.g., 100 ± 15% for major CRMs).
  - Detection limits and counting uncertainties explicitly reported (e.g., Cs-137 ~0.18 Bq per sample; Sr-90 ~20% uncertainty).
  - Consistent reporting across soils, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates; explicit detailing of sample preparation and digestion protocols.
- Data provenance and traceability:
  - Extensive methodological documentation and references to established methods and prior studies.
  - Data intended for inclusion in the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre, ensuring discoverability and reuse.

## Data management and accessibility

- Data governance and sharing:
  - The collected radionuclide, stable element, and dose-rate data are positioned for integration into broader wildlife radiological databases and inter-laboratory comparisons.
  - Multiple data streams (various species, matrices, and analyses) are standardised through harmonised sampling and QA procedures to support cross-study comparability.
- Documentation and usage context:
  - Comprehensive methodological references provided, enabling reproducibility and cross-application to different ecosystems or ICRP RAP sets.

## Takeaways for Data Leaders

- Whole-system data perspective: The study aggregates diverse biological and environmental media to support dose assessment for wildlife, illustrating the importance of end-to-end data integration across matrices.
- Data discoverability and standards: Emphasizes standardized sampling, robust QA with CRMs, and detailed documentation to enable reuse and inter-site comparisons (e.g., ERICA Tool inputs, ICRP RAP alignment).
- User needs and collaboration: Data support advanced risk assessment models and cross-study benchmarking; the dataset is designed to be shared with the wider data community through a data centre, facilitating co-ownership and collaborative analysis.
- Gaps and future work (in context of data leadership): While extensive, the dataset relies on heterogeneous sample types and periods; future efforts could enhance metadata completeness (e.g., occupancy factors, detailed tissue-specific data) and expand harmonization across sites to strengthen comparability and utility for policy-relevant radiological risk assessments.
