# Supporting Document Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Grasmere 1968 to 2013

- Overview: Long-term monitoring dataset of Grasmere (Cumbria, England) measuring surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a from 1968 to 2013.
- Data provenance: Collected initially by the Freshwater Biological Association; since 1989 by CEH and its predecessor Institute of Freshwater Ecology.
- Sampling regime: Weekly to fortnightly sampling; started 1968 for some variables; water samples integrated from 0 to 5 m; measurements typically taken from a boat at the lake buoy (deepest part); if buoy access was not possible, samples collected from the shore (Flag 2).
- Variables and units:
  - TEMP: Surface temperature, °C
  - OXYG: Surface oxygen saturation, % air-saturation
  - SECC: Secchi depth, m
  - ALKA: Alkalinity, µg CaCO3 per L
  - PH: pH
  - NH4N: Ammonium, µg N per L
  - NO3N: Nitrate, µg N per L
  - PO4P: Soluble reactive phosphate, µg P per L
  - TOTP: Total phosphorus, µg P per L
  - SIO2: Dissolved reactive silicon, µg per L
  - TOCA: Phytoplankton chlorophyll a, µg per L
- Data structure and format:
  - Delivered as CSV with columns: sdate (measurement date), variable (description of the variable), value (measurement value), sign_if_LT_LOD (indicates below detection limit), flag (1 = buoy, 2 = shore).
- Data quality and limitations:
  - Raw data, not yet quality controlled or calibrated (except for double entries from 2005 onwards); visually checked.
  - Some samples were not integrated (shore samples) when buoy access was not possible.
  - Detection limits are indicated with a “<” sign in sign_if_LT_LOD.
- Temporal and geographic scope:
  - Temporal coverage: June 1968 to end of 2013.
  - Geographic scope: Grasmere Lake, Cumbria, England.
- Data usage notes:
  - Suitable for long-term trend analyses and cross-variable relationships, with the caveat of raw QC status and potential sampling method changes over time.
  - Useful for linking with published studies; dataset has been cited in multiple recent publications.
- Example publications using the dataset:
  - 2013: Catchment productivity controls CO2 emissions from lakes (Nature Climate Change)
  - 2012: Forty years of monitoring water quality in Grasmere: enrichment vs hydraulic flushing on phytoplankton ecology (Freshwater Biology)
  - 2016: Coupling of carbon and silicon geochemical cycles in rivers and lakes (Scientific Reports)
  - 2016: Lake surface temperatures (State of the Climate in 2015) (Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society)
- Implications for data strategy and governance:
  - Highlights the importance of documenting data provenance, collection methods, and QC status.
  - Demonstrates need for ongoing quality control, calibration, and standardized metadata to enhance discoverability and reusability across networks.
  - Underlines potential data gaps due to accessibility and sampling approach (buoy vs shore) over time.
