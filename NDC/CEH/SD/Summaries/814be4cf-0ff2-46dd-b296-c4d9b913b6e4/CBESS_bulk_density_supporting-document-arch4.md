# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil bulk density from three soil depths on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset measuring soil bulk density (g/cm3) at three depth intervals (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm) across saltmarsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay.
- Timeframe: Winter and Summer 2013, with Essex winter samples collected 2–6 March 2013.
- Staff: Hilary Ford.
- Sites: Essex – Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM); Morecambe Bay – Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Context: Sites represent contrasting soil types (clay in Essex; sandy in Morecambe Bay) with differing inundation, creek structures, and vegetation; grazing regimes varied by site.

## What data are included
- Primary variable: Bulk density for each sample (g/cm3) at three depths (D1: 0–10 cm, D2: 10–20 cm, D3: 20–30 cm).
- Spatial and temporal coverage: Six sites, across Winter and Summer seasons; quadrats numbered 1–22 per site/scale.
- Data format: Excel workbook; NA cells indicate no data.
- Dataset fields described: Row Number, Season (Winter W, Summer S), Location (Morecambe M, Essex E), Site (CS, WS, WP; AH, FW, TM), Habitat (Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM), Quadrat Number (1–22), Scale (A=1m, B=1–10m, C=10–100m, D=100–upper limit), BD_D1 (0–10 cm), BD_D2 (10–20 cm), BD_D3 (20–30 cm).

## How the data were collected
- Method: Bulk density calculated from soil cores (bulk density rings: 3.1 cm height, 7.5 cm diameter) taken vertically at three depths per quadrat.
- Preparation: Soil samples dried at 105°C for 72 hours prior to measurement.
- Sampling framework: Part of a general field campaign in Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples collected in an additional window (2–6 March 2013).

## Data structure and metadata
- Dataset includes explicit field descriptions to support discoverability and reuse, including season, location, site, habitat, quadrat number, scale, and depth-specific bulk density measurements.
- Scale coding and site/habitat combinations are documented, aiding cross-site comparability.
- Metadata notes: Calibration procedures marked as None; quality control procedures are listed but not detailed.

## Location and sampling frame
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes (clay soils; differing grazing pressures and geese presence).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands, West Plain (sandy soils; grazing regimes include sheep and geese).
- Sampling period aligned with broader coastal monitoring in 2013, capturing seasonal variation and depth-specific soil properties.

## Quality, formats, and reuse
- Data in an accessible Excel workbook format with clearly labeled depth layers and site metadata.
- Data quality notes indicate no explicit calibration; presence of NA cells signals incomplete data for some quadrats/depths.
- Structured metadata (row, season, location, site, habitat, quadrat, scale, and depth-specific BD fields) supports integration with broader CBESS datasets and reuse for comparative analyses across sites, depths, and seasons.

## How this supports data leadership aims
- Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: from field data collection in diverse coastal ecosystems to structured metadata and accessible formats.
- Emphasizes data discoverability and interoperability through explicit field definitions and standardized depth measurements.
- Provides a reproducible data product that can be updated, validated, and integrated with wider data communities (CBESS and related coastal datasets).
- Highlights the importance of capturing site-level context (soil type, grazing, inundation) to interpret bulk density data and prioritize data gaps.
