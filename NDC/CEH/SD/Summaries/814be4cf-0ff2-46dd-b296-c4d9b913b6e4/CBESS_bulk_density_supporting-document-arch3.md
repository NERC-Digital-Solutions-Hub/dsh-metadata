# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil bulk density from three soil depths on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Purpose and scope
  - A dataset of soil bulk density (g/cm3) measured at three depth bands (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm) to support monitoring of soil physical properties relevant to coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service sustainability.
  - Intended to inform environmental health monitoring frameworks and decision-making.

- Study sites and context
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
  - Sites chosen to represent contrasting soil types (clay in Essex; sand in Morecambe Bay) and differing inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.
  - Grazing regimes varied: heavy hare grazing in Essex; intensive sheep grazing in Morecambe Bay; light grazing at West Plain.

- Sampling design and timeline
  - Field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013.
  - Additional Essex winter samples collected 2–6 March 2013.
  - Sampling adjacent to flume cores within each site/quadrat.

- Data collected and measurement methods
  - Variable observed: Bulk density (BD) at three depths (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm).
  - Method: soil cores (3.1 cm height, 7.5 cm diameter) collected per quadrat; samples dried at 105°C for 72 hours; bulk density calculated as dry soil mass divided by core volume.
  - Data formats: Excel workbook; “NA” indicates missing data.

- Data structure and content
  - Row metadata: Row Number (sorting key), Season (Winter W or Summer S).
  - Location/habitat: Location (Morecambe M or Essex E); Site (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex); Habitat (Mudflat MF or Saltmarsh SM).
  - Spatial indexing: Quadrat Number (1–22); Scale (A–D) indicating spatial range (A: 1 m; B: 1–10 m; C: 10–100 m; D: 100–upper limit).
  - Bulk density fields: BD_D1 (0–10 cm), BD_D2 (10–20 cm), BD_D3 (20–30 cm).

- Data quality, governance and provenance
  - Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
  - Quality control and data checking procedures are acknowledged; calibration procedures noted as None for this dataset.
  - Data sharing and metadata practices referenced (dataset described with explicit site, habitat, and sampling metadata); Excel format facilitates dissemination, with explicit notes on missing data.

- Relevance for monitoring and policy use
  - Provides standardized, site-comparative soil physical property measurements across multiple coastal saltmarsh locations.
  - Enables cross-site monitoring of soil bulk density as an indicator of soil structure and potential changes in ecosystem services.
  - Supports transparent data provenance and open data sharing through a well-documented dataset structure.
