# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil bulk density from three soil depths on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Purpose: Dataset documenting soil bulk density (g/cm3) at three depths (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm) across salt marsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay to support analyses of soil properties and ecosystem services.
- Timeframe: Field campaigns in Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples collected in an extended sampling window (2–6 March 2013).
- Lead/Contact: Hilary Ford.

## Dataset content and scope

- Primary variable: Bulk density (BD) at three depths (BD_D1, BD_D2, BD_D3).
- Observation unit: One sample per quadrat, across three depth zones.
- Dataset format: Excel workbook (NA cells indicate missing data).

## Locations and site descriptions

- Essex, UK (clay soil): 
  - Abbotts Hall (AH) – 51.783°N, 0.8667°E
  - Fingringhoe Wick (FW) – 51.8167°N, 0.9667°E
  - Tillingham Marshes (TM) – 51.6833°N, 0.9333°E
- Morecambe Bay, UK (sandy soil): 
  - Cartmel Sands (CS) – 54.1667°N, 3.0000°W
  - Warton Sands (WS) – 54.1333°N, 2.8000°W
  - West Plain (WP) – 54.0000°N, 3.0000°W
- Habitats included: Saltmarsh (SM) and Mudflat (MF).

## Sampling design and context

- Sampling campaign: Winter and Summer 2013; additional Essex winter sampling window noted.
- Quadrat-level sampling: Each quadrat yields a single bulk-density sample per depth zone.
- Gauging context: Saltmarsh sites represent contrasting soil types (clay in Essex; sandy in Morecambe Bay) with differing inundation frequency, creek structure, and vegetation.

## Methods and procedures

- Depths and measurement: 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm.
- Bulk density calculation: BD = Dry soil mass (g) / Volume of soil core (cm3).
- Soil cores: Bulk density rings (3.1 cm height, 7.5 cm diameter) used to collect samples.
- Sample preparation: Soils dried at 105°C for 72 hours prior to measurement.
- Calibration: None reported.
- Data quality: Mentions data checking procedures; no explicit calibration, but standard QA steps implied.
