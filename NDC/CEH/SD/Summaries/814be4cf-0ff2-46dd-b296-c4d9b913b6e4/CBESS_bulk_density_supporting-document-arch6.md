# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil bulk density from three soil depths on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset records soil bulk density from three depth zones (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm) across six saltmarsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay, as part of CBESS.
  - Aims to support data exploration, combination with other CBESS data, and creation of data products for end users.

- Data collection details
  - Depth zones measured: 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm.
  - Bulk density calculation: bulk density (g/cm^3) = dry soil mass (g) / soil core volume (cm^3).
  - Core and sampling: samples taken with bulk density rings (3.1 cm height, 7.5 cm diameter) in quadrats; three depths sampled vertically per quadrat.
  - Sample preparation: soils dried at 105°C for 72 hours prior to measurement.
  - Seasonality: Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples additionally collected 2–6 March 2013.
  - Staff: Hilary Ford.

- Locations and environmental context
  - Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
  - Site characteristics: Essex (clay soils) vs. Morecambe Bay (sandy soils); differing inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
  - Grazing regimes: Essex hare-grazed (with Brent geese grazing at Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick); Morecambe Bay heavily sheep-grazed (Cartmel Sands and Warton Sands) with pink-footed geese in winter; West Plain lightly grazed.

- Data structure and fields
  - File format: Excel workbook.
  - Core fields (examples):
    - Row Number: sortable index.
    - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S).
    - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E).
    - Site: Morecambe – Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP); Essex – Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
    - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM).
    - Quadrat Number: 1–22.
    - Scale: A (1 m), B (1–10 m), C (10–100 m), D (100 m to upper limit).
    - BD_D1: Bulk density at 0–10 cm.
    - BD_D2: Bulk density at 10–20 cm.
    - BD_D3: Bulk density at 20–30 cm.
  - Notes: NA cells indicate no data.

- Methods and quality information
  - Procedures: bulk density calculated from dried cores; no calibration procedures reported.
  - Data quality: explicit quality control procedures are not detailed in the metadata.
  - Data accessibility: provided as an Excel workbook; broadly described field definitions to enable re-use and integration with other CBESS datasets.

- How to use and potential applications
  - Combine with other CBESS datasets (e.g., biodiversity, ecosystem services) to analyze relationships with soil properties.
  - Create self-serve data products (dashboards, pivot tables) by site, habitat, depth, and season.
  - Compare soil bulk density across contrasting soil types (clay vs. sandy) and grazing regimes.
  - Assess data coverage and identify gaps or missing data for targeted field campaigns.
