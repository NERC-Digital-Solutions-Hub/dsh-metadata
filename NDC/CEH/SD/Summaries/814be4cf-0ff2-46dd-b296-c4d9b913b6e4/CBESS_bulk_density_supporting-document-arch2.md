# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil bulk density from three soil depths on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Aim and scope
- Provides measured soil bulk density data to support monitoring of environmental health and ecosystem service potential at salt marsh sites.
- Data intended for standardised assessment, comparison over time, and integration with other environmental datasets.

## Data provenance and responsibility
- Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
- Part of CBESS, with data collected during a field campaign in Winter and Summer 2013, plus an Essex-specific sampling window (2–6 March 2013).

## Locations and site characteristics
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Saltmarsh sites chosen to represent two contrasting soil types:
  - Essex: clay soils (southeastern Atlantic UK).
  - Morecambe Bay: sandy soils (west UK).
- Regional differences include inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
- Grazing regimes differ by site:
  - Essex: hare-grazed; AH and FW heavily grazed by Brent geese.
  - Morecambe Bay: CS and WS heavily grazed by sheep; occasional winter grazing by pink-footed geese; WP lightly grazed.

## Sampling design and monitoring cadence
- Field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples collected in an extended sampling window (2–6 March 2013).
- Each quadrat provides bulk density data across three depth zones (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm).

## Variables and measurement methods
- Primary variable: Bulk density (g/cm^3).
- Depth zones: 0–10 cm (BD_D1), 10–20 cm (BD_D2), 20–30 cm (BD_D3).
- Sampling method: Bulk density rings (3.1 cm height, 7.5 cm diameter) used to extract cores; soils dried at 105°C for 72 hours prior to measurement.
- Bulk density calculated as Dry soil mass / Volume of soil core.
- Habitat types recorded: Saltmarsh (SM) and Mudflat (MF) where applicable.

## Data structure and formats
- Dataset provided as an Excel workbook.
- Key fields (Dataset Field descriptions example):
  - Row Number (sort order)
  - Season (Winter W, Summer S)
  - Location (Morecambe M, Essex E)
  - Site (CS, WS, WP or AH, FW, TM)
  - Habitat (Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22)
  - Scale (A=1m, B=1–10m, C=10–100m, D=100–upper limit)
  - BD_D1 (0–10 cm), BD_D2 (10–20 cm), BD_D3 (20–30 cm)
- NA cells indicate missing data.

## Quality control and data quality
- Calibration procedures: None reported.
- Data checking/quality control procedures: Not explicitly detailed in the provided metadata.

## Data use and accessibility
- Provides a structured, repeatable format suitable for integration with other environmental data.
- Facilitates spatial and depth-wise comparisons of soil bulk density across contrasting salt marsh habitats and grazing regimes.
- Dataset designed to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals as part of standard monitoring outputs.

## Practical considerations for analysts
- Useful for assessing soil physical properties linked to sediment dynamics, inundation effects, and ecosystem service potential.
- When combining with other CBESS or environmental datasets, consider site-specific grazing intensity, soil type (clay vs. sand), and inundation patterns to contextualize bulk density differences.
- Be mindful of missing data indicated by NA entries when performing analyses or aggregations.
