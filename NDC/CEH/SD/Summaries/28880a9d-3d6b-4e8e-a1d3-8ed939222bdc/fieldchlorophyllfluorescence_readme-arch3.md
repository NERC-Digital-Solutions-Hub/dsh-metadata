# Data collected on Mt Etna during the field transplant in 2017

## Overview
- Field transplant experiment conducted on Mt Etna in 2017.
- Five genotypes randomly selected for each of two Senecio species: AE = S. aethnensis and CH = S. chrysanthemifolius.
- For each genotype, four cuttings were taken per transplant elevation; four leaves measured per plant.
- Measurements repeated on a second day to account for weather and measurement timing.
- After 30 minutes of dark adaptation, light response measurements were recorded with an IMAGING-PAM M-series chlorophyll fluorometer.
- Primary analysis used the PI(total) variable, representing total photosynthetic capacity.

## Experimental design and sampling
- Genotype identity derived from individuals grown in the glasshouse from which cuttings were taken.
- TGSite records the elevation of transplant sites.
- TGBlock denotes replicate experimental blocks in the field.
- Grid provides grid location of plants within each block; genotype randomized to different grid locations.
- Day indicates the day measurements were taken.

## Measurements and data collection
- Fluorometer outputs recorded across columns 7–22; analysis focused on PI(total).
- Measurements included multiple plant parts (four cuttings per genotype, four leaves per plant) and repeated measurements on a second day.

## Data variables and outputs
- Species: AE (S. aethnensis) and CH (S. chrysanthemifolius).
- Genotype: identifier for the source genotype used for cuttings.
- TGSite: transplant elevation.
- TGBlock: field block replication.
- Grid: plant location within a block (genotype randomized).
- Day: measurement day.
- PI(total): total photosynthetic capacity used for analysis; other fluorometer outputs exist but were not used in the analysis.

## Data usage and implications for environmental monitoring
- Design supports comparative assessment of photosynthetic capacity across species, genotypes, and transplant elevations.
- Emphasizes the importance of multi-layer metadata (site, block, grid, day) for traceability and replication.
- Demonstrates rigorous data collection practices (replication, randomization, standardization of measurement protocol).
- Highlights potential data governance considerations for environmental monitoring datasets (clear provenance, full metadata, and rationale for selecting PI(total) for analysis).
