# Data collected on Mt Etna during the field transplant in 2017

- Overview of the experiment
  - Five genotypes randomly selected for each of two Senecio species
  - Four cuttings per genotype at each transplant elevation
  - Four leaves measured per plant
  - Measurements repeated on a second day to account for weather and timing
  - After 30 minutes of dark adaptation, light response measured with an IMAGING-PAM M-series chlorophyll fluorometer
- Measurements and instrument
  - Instrument: IMAGING-PAM M-series chlorophyll fluorometer
  - Primary output used in analysis: PI(total), representing total photosynthetic capacity
- Variables collected
  - Species: AE = S. aethnensis; CH = S. chrysanthemifolius
  - Genotype: ID from individuals grown in the glasshouse
  - TGSite: Elevation of the transplant sites
  - TGBlock: Replicate experimental blocks in the field
  - Grid: Grid location within each block (genotype randomized to grid locations)
  - Day: Day measurements were taken
  - Columns 7-22: Fluorometer outputs; PI(total) used for analysis
- Data handling and analysis notes
  - Data collected on Mt Etna during the field transplant in 2017
  - Measurements designed to be standardized and comparable across conditions
  - Analysis focuses on PI(total) as an indicator of total photosynthetic capacity
