# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2021

- UKCEH LCM2021 is the ninth UK land cover map, produced annually, classifying land cover into 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes aligned with Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats (with some differences for consistency).  
- The product comprises six geospatial datasets split across Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI): three for GB and NI each (two 10 m pixel-based datasets and land parcel datasets) plus 25 m rasterised land parcels. It also provides 1 km summary products.  
- Formal validation reports an overall accuracy of 82.6% at full thematic detail (95% CI 82.19–82.99%).

## Purpose and Scope

- Purpose: provide data production, validation, and accuracy details to help users apply LCM2021 appropriately in current and future work.  
- Core datasets: six total (GB and NI), including:
  - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (per GB and NI)
  - Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Additional 1 km products (dominant class and percentage cover by class/aggregate)
- Annual production aims to improve temporal consistency, support change detection, and distinguish real change from random classification errors.

## Key Concepts and Classes

- UKCEH Land Cover Classes: 21 classes defined by UKCEH, derived from BAP Broad Habitats (with essential distinctions outlined in appendices).  
- BAP Broad Habitats: used for context and cross-reference; includes categories like Broadleaved Woodland, Coniferous Woodland, Arable, Improved Grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid Grasslands, Bracken, Heather, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Bog, Standing Open Water, Rivers/Streams, Montane/Inland Rock, Built-Up Areas, Saline and Littoral coastal habitats, among others.  
- Generalised vs. detailed mapping: 21 UKCEH classes provide detailed mapping, while UKCEH Aggregate Classes offer generalised land parcel representations when full detail is not required.

## Data Production and Methodology

- Seasonal Composite Images:
  - Derived from Google Earth Engine using Sentinel-2 surface reflectance, resampled to 10 m.
  - Four seasons used: Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec (spectral bands 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8A,11,12).
  - Seasonal gaps may occur due to clouds; algorithm tolerates partial spectral information to produce complete UK results.
- Context Rasters:
  - 10 m GB Context Rasters (e.g., height, aspect, slope, distances to buildings/roads/sea/freshwater, foreshore, tidal water, woodland mask) to reduce spectral confusion.
  - 10 m NI Context Rasters include height, aspect, slope, urban mask, distance to coast/roads/freshwater, foreshore and tidal masks.
- Classification Scenes:
  - GB: 32 Classification Scenes (tiles ~100 x 100 km) plus some enlarged tiles to account for sea areas; NI: a single Classification Scene (49-band) for the wider NI landmass.
  - Each Classification Scene is trained and classified independently; features include the Seasonal Composite images and the Context Rasters (50-band GB scenes; 49-band NI scene).
- Bootstrap Training:
  - Self-starting training method that uses historic land cover maps (LCM2018–LCM2020) as training data, reducing need for new field data.
  - Training samples are drawn from land parcels with >80% purity consistently across three years, enabling balanced learning for the Random Forest (RF) classifier.
- Random Forest Classification:
  - RF classifier trained with bootstrapped samples (10,000 per class per bag) to yield 10 m Classified Pixel product; the first band is the most likely land cover class, the second band is the associated class probability/confidence.
  - Classification software combines Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL (open source).
- UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework:
  - A fixed framework used to aggregate 10 m pixels into land parcels (~0.5 ha minimum mapping unit, MMU) to reduce noise and enable change detection.
  - Parcel identifiers (gid) differ from LCM2015 due to framework changes; spatial overlap-based comparisons across versions may not be straightforward.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel and 1 km Products:
  - 25 m rasters are generated by rasterising land parcels, carrying three attributes: dominant class (mode), mean confidence, and purity.
  - 1 km products summarize 25 m data to dominant class and percentage cover for both class-level and aggregate-level mappings (percentages rounded to integers; coastal areas may sum to less than 100 due to coastal mapping extents).

## Datasets and Access

- Datasets (as per Appendix 3):  
  - 10 m Classified Raster Product (GB and NI)  
  - Land Parcel Product (GB and NI)  
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel Product (GB and NI)  
  - 1 km Dominant/Percentage products (class and aggregate)  
- Coordinate Systems:
  - GB: British National Grid (EPSG 27700)
  - NI: Irish Grid TM75 (EPSG 29903)
- Metadata and naming: official dataset names and citations provided; dataset extents and counts (e.g., GB parcels ~6.74 million; NI parcels ~0.90 million) with pixel resolutions (10 m and 25 m) and band counts (2 bands for 10 m pixel products; 3 bands for 25 m rasterised parcels).
- Data quality and validation details included in Appendix 4 (confusion matrices, producer’s and user’s accuracies) and Appendix 5–6 (color recipes); full validation reported in Appendix 4.

## Validation and Accuracy

- Validation: 35,182 points distributed across all 21 classes, combining GB countryside survey data, National Forest Inventory, Rural Payments data, and bespoke validation points.  
- Accuracy: 82.6% overall accuracy with a 95% confidence interval of 82.19% to 82.99% for full thematic detail.  
- Validation is tied to 25 m rasterised parcel data; 10 m classified pixels were not separately validated against ground truth in the formal validation.

## Practical Considerations and Caveats

- 10 m Classified Pixels:
  - Not generalised by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework; preserves fine features (e.g., narrow patches) that may be below the 0.5 ha MMU. Users should be aware that formal validation targets the 25 m parcel data, so 10 m pixel results require careful interpretation for accuracy claims.
  - Higher spectral confusion exists among certain classes; context rasters and seasonal data mitigate some of this but some cross-class confusion (e.g., between Fancy combinations of grasses, bog, fen) remains.
- Temporal and Change Detection:
  - Annual production aids in distinguishing genuine land cover change from random errors; random errors are expected to flicker over time, whereas real changes persist.
- Relationship to BAP Broad Habitats:
  - While 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes map closely to BAP Broad Habitats, there are deliberate deviations for compatibility and training; appendices provide detailed mapping notes and caveats.
- Use of Bootstrap Training:
  - Relies on historical, wall-to-wall maps for training; assumes target dynamics are slower than the refresh interval; large bootstrap datasets help balance learning across rarer classes.
- Data Discoverability:
  - Datasets and metadata are intended to be discoverable via portals with clear provenance and documentation.

## Summary of Value for Analysts

- Provides annually updated, high-resolution (10 m) land cover data across GB and NI, enabling detailed spatial analysis, trend detection, and model-based predictions of land cover change.
- Combines advanced machine learning with extensive contextual information to maximize classification accuracy and reduce spectral confusion.
- Delivers both pixel-level data and parcel-based summaries, plus scalable 1 km products suitable for larger-scale analyses and integration with other datasets.
- Documented validation, data lineage, and methodological transparency support robust statistical and policy-relevant analyses.
