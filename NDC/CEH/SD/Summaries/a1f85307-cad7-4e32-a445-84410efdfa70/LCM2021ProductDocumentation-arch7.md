# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2021

## Overview
- UKCEH LCM2021 is the ninth UK land cover map, produced annually using automated methods.
- Product consists of six geospatial datasets (three for Great Britain and three for Northern Ireland): 10 m Classified Pixel dataset, Classified Land Parcel dataset, and 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset.
- Land cover is defined as 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Broad Habitats, with some nuances to maintain consistency with earlier products).
- Classification uses Classification Scenes built from Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images plus 10 Context Rasters to reduce spectral confusion; Bootstrap Training paired with a Random Forest classifier.
- Formal validation indicates overall accuracy of 82.6% (95% CI 82.19%–82.99%) at full thematic detail.

## Product suite and datasets
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Pixel-level classification with two bands: most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class and the associated class membership probability.
  - Native 10 m resolution preserves fine landscape features; not generalised by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
- Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to create parcel-level attributes.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Rasterised representation of land parcels at 25 m resolution with three bands: dominant land cover (mode), mean confidence (conf), and parcel purity (purity).
- 1 km raster products
  - Derived by summarising 25 m rasters to 1 km pixels.
  - Provide dominant cover (for both 21 classes and 10 aggregate classes) and percentage cover (for both 21 classes and 10 aggregate classes; values are integers and may not sum to exactly 100 due to rounding).

## Data details and spatial framework
- Coordinate systems
  - Great Britain: British National Grid, EPSG 27700
  - Northern Ireland: Irish Transverse Mercator (TM75), EPSG 29903
- Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Minimum parcel size ≈ 0.5 ha (MMU)
  - Parcels are generalised from national cartography to reduce noise; 10 m classified pixels are not generalised in the 10 m dataset to preserve detail.
  - Parcel identifiers (gid) in LCM2021 do not match LCM2015 if you compare by parcel ID; spatial overlap comparisons will not be immediately possible.
- Temporal and methodological context
  - Classification Scenes: GB classified via 32 tiles (~100 x 100 km tiles) using 50-band Seasonal Composite Images plus context rasters; NI uses a single 40-band Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite with NI context rasters.
  - Seasonal Composite Images derived from Sentinel-2 data (spectral bands and four seasonal periods).
  - Context Rasters provide additional information to reduce spectral confusion (terrain, proximity to features, water bodies, urban areas, etc.).

## Seasonal data and context rasters
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Based on Sentinel-2 reflectance, resampled to 10 m with median reflectance computed for four seasons (Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec) using 10 Sentinel-2 bands (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8A, 11, 12).
  - Occasional data gaps due to clouds are mitigated by classifier tolerance; gaps are not required to be manually filled.
- Context Rasters (10 m)
  - Great Britain: height, aspect, slope; distance to nearest building, road, sea, freshwater; foreshore and tidal water masks; woodland mask.
  - Northern Ireland: height, aspect, slope; urban mask; distance to coast, freshwater, road; foreshore and tidal water masks.

## Classification approach
- Bootstrap Training
  - Automatic training dataset created from historical land maps (LCM2018–LCM2020) with >80% purity parcels that were consistently classified in all three years.
  - Enables sampling of pixels from Classification Scenes to create training data without fresh field data.
- Random Forest classification
  - Balanced sampling: 10,000 samples per class per bag with replacement to train the RF classifier; ensures rarer classes are adequately learned.
  - Output: 10 m Classified Pixel product with class and associated confidence.
- Validation and accuracy
  - Validation dataset: 35,182 points across all 21 classes, using a composite reference data set from GB countryside survey, National Forest Inventory data, Rural Payments Agency data, and manual/field-derived points.
  - Overall accuracy: 82.6% (95% CI 82.19%–82.99%) at full thematic detail.

## UKCEH Land Cover Class definitions and BAP relation
- UKCEH 21 Land Cover Classes are closely related to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats but are not identical.
- In Appendices, the document explains how some BAP Broad Habitats map to UKCEH classes and how some splits or combinations are handled (e.g., Freshwater combines Standing Open Water and Canals with Rivers and Streams; Saltwater vs Freshwater distinctions rely on Context Rasters and coastline proximity).
- When referring to BAP Broad Habitats, terms are italicised to reduce ambiguity; UKCEH classes are capitalised.

## Practical usage notes for GIS specialists
- Data selection
  - Use 10 m Classified Pixel for detailed map products; suitable for fine-scale mapping and feature extraction, but expect higher data volume and processing needs.
  - Use 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel products for parcel-based analysis and change detection with the Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - Use 1 km products for broad-scale landscape summaries and rapid overview.
- Limitations and caveats
  - 10 m pixel data are not generalised to the Land Parcel Spatial Framework; this preserves narrow features but means higher noise at parcel boundaries.
  - Validation is based on the 25 m rasterised dataset; users focusing on 10 m detail should be aware that accuracy estimates are tied to the validation dataset.
  - Some spectral confusion remains (e.g., Saltwater vs Freshwater near coasts; various grassland types; peat/bog vs acid grasslands) even with Context Rasters.
  - UK BAP Broad Habitat mappings are not a one-to-one match with UKCEH classes; refer to appendices for detailed relationships.
- Data management and reproducibility
  - Bootstrap Training relies on historic maps (2018–2020) to train the current classifier; spatially extensive historical data are crucial for robust training.
  - Parcel IDs (gid) differ from LCM2015; cross-map comparisons by parcel ID may require spatial overlap approaches rather than ID matching.
- Data access and structure
  - Official dataset names and extents are provided in Appendix 3; refer to these for data naming when cataloguing or importing into GIS.
  - 10 m datasets include two bands (class and confidence); 25 m datasets include three bands (mode, conf, purity) to support parcel-based analyses.
  - 1 km products include dominant class rasters and percentage cover rasters for both 21 classes and 10 aggregate classes.

## Quick reference: key figures and relationships
- 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes; alignment with BAP Broad Habitats with some carefully managed distinctions.
- GB and NI datasets; GB: 10 m + parcel + 25 m parcel; NI: 10 m + parcel + 25 m parcel.
- Validation: 82.6% overall accuracy; 95% CI 82.19%–82.99%.
- MMU: approx. 0.5 ha for land parcels; parcels are designed to represent discrete real-world units.
- Temporal aim: annual LCM production to maximize change detection capabilities and temporal consistency.
