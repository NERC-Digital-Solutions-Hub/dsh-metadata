# Durleigh Reservoir Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter Measurements

- Metadata for acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) data collected at Durleigh Reservoir from 20/08/2018 to 24/08/2018.
- Instruments and setup:
  - Nortek Vector ADV
  - Measured near-bed water velocities (10 cm above bed) near reservoir surface mixers
  - Compass calibrated prior to deployment; velocities converted to ENU (East-North-Up)
  - Burst mode operation: 16 seconds of data every 10 minutes
  - Sampling frequency: 64 Hz
- Authors and citation:
  - Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain
  - Citation: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter measurements from Durleigh Reservoir, August 2018.
- Spatial and temporal extent:
  - Location: Lat 51.1215, Lon -3.0396
  - Measurements taken over 5 days (days 1–5 corresponding to August 20–24, 2018)
- Data files and structure:
  - File types: dat and sen
  - Day-based files named day1, day2, day3, day4, day5
- dat file contents (velocities and quality metrics):
  - vel_xe (m/s) – East component
  - vel_yn (m/s) – North component
  - vel_zu (m/s) – Up/vertical component
  - Amp1, Amp2, Amp3 (counts)
  - snr1, snr2, snr3 (dB)
  - corr1, corr2, corr3 (%)
  - pres (dbar)
- sen file contents (timing, orientation, and environmental context):
  - Hour, Minute, Second
  - soundspeed (m/s)
  - heading (degrees)
  - pitch (degrees)
  - roll (degrees)
  - tempearture (degrees C) [note: header contains a typo in "tempearture"]
- Data characteristics and notes:
  - ENU velocities derived from compass orientation
  - Data capture aligned to 5-day period with separate per-day files
  - Calibration and quality indicators included (snr, corr)
  - Temperature field misspelling present in header; verify during processing
- How this supports GIS work:
  - Enables creation of map-based visualizations of near-bed flow fields
  - Can be combined with time stamps to generate animated or time-series velocity maps
  - Supports analyses of flow direction, magnitude, and variability around reservoir mixers
- Processing and integration considerations:
  - Merge dat (velocity components and quality metrics) with sen (time, orientation, and environmental context) by timestamp
  - Transform velocity components to desired coordinate system if needed
  - Use latitude/longitude location as the spatial reference for GIS layers
- Access and provenance:
  - Data are organized by day (day1–day5) covering Aug 20–24, 2018
  - Metadata includes instrument setup, location, and measurement parameters to support reproducibility and proper interpretation in GIS workflows
