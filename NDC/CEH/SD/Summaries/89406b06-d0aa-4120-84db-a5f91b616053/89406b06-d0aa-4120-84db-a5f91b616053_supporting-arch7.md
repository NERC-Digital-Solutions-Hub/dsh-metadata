# Entomological and microclimate data logger data for the Kilombero valley in Tanzania

## Overview
- Global malaria hotspot context: Kilombero Valley, Tanzania.
- Long-running field study (since 2007) collecting primary malaria vectors in four villages: Lupiro, Kidugalo, Minepa, Sagamaganga.
- Mosquitoes identified to species (An. gambiae, An. funestus) with sex and abdominal status recorded.
- When available, daily links to on-site microclimate data (temperature, humidity, vapour pressure deficit).
- Data supports exploration of relationships between malaria vector dynamics and environmental conditions.
- Supporting information available for the 2018 dataset publication.

## Spatial and temporal scope
- Villages and approximate locations:
  - Lupiro (8.38°S, 36.67°E)
  - Kidugalo (8.51°S, 36.52°E)
  - Minepa (8.26°S, 36.68°E)
  - Sagamaganga (8.07°S, 36.80°E)
- Spatial units in the dataset are at village and household levels, with village codes and household identifiers.
- Timeframe: sampling from 04/07/2016 to 14/09/2017.
- Sampling design:
  - MET (Mosquito Electrocuting Traps): indoor and outdoor trapping, hourly data from 18:00 to 06:00.
  - CDC light traps: indoor trapping, nightly data from 18:00 to 06:00.
- Data gaps: MET data missing at the study start and for 3 weeks in June 2017 due to equipment issues.

## Data structure and formats
- Data stored as comma-separated values (CSV) in two files:
  - MET_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv (6280 lines, 26 columns)
  - CDC_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv (853 lines, 30 columns)
- Key identifiers:
  - village (three-letter code: KID, MIN, LUP, SAG)
  - villageHH (household identifier within village, e.g., SAG1)
  - traptype (MET or CDC)
  - trap and time period identifiers (e.g., MET1:1, CDC1:1, etc.)
  - date, Month (e.g., JUL), year
  - IN.OUT ( indoor or outdoor for MET; indoor for CDC)
  - Time start / Time end (hourly windows for MET; nightly windows for CDC)
- Village coordinates are provided in the description (not as embedded coordinates in each row); spatial placement can be inferred via village codes.

## Measurements and instruments
- Mosquito trapping methods:
  - MET traps: indoor and outdoor placements; four 35 × 35 cm panels with electrified wires, powered by 24 V DC batteries.
  - CDC light traps: standard indoor trap with a fan and light attractant; powered by 12 V batteries.
- Mosquito data recorded per trap per time interval:
  - Anopheles species counts (examples): Agml (An. gambiae males), Agfed (blood-fed An. gambiae females), Agunfed (unfed An. gambiae), Aggrv (gravid An. gambiae), Afml (An. funestus males), Affed (blood-fed An. funestus), Affunf (unfed An. funestus), Afgrv (gravid An. funestus), Acml (An. coustani males), Acfem (An. coustani females), OthAn (other non-identified Anopheles).
  - For MET: hourly counts; for CDC: daily counts.
- Microclimate data:
  - Tiny Tag loggers recorded indoor temperature and humidity hourly; data downloaded weekly.
  - On-site mean, max, and min temperature and humidity available for CDC data.
- Fieldwork details:
  - Temperature and humidity used to calculate indoor saturation deficit (based on Allen et al., 1998).
  - Calibration and validation steps include PCR/ELISA species confirmation, logger calibration, and regular checks of trap power systems.

## Calibration, quality control, and data processing
- Species validation: a subset of mosquitoes tested for malaria parasites and species verification via PCR/ELISA.
- Instrument calibration:
  - Tiny Tag data loggers calibrated annually; weekly cross-checks in a controlled room.
  - MET trap grid voltages checked twice nightly with a voltmeter.
  - CDC trap batteries checked at the start of each trapping night.
- Data processing:
  - Indoor microclimate data used to derive saturation deficit and linked to entomological counts where available.
  - Data managed and organized with identifiers to enable linkage across trap type, time, and household.

## Implications and GIS applications
- Suitable for map-based analyses of malaria vectors across four villages and multiple households.
- Enables spatial visualization of species abundance by village/household and temporal trends (hourly MET, daily CDC).
- Can be combined with on-site microclimate data to explore environmental drivers of mosquito dynamics.
- Data quality notes essential for mapping workflows, including gaps due to equipment issues and the need to integrate coordinates for precise geolocation (village coordinates provided in text).
- Potential uses include risk mapping, vector surveillance planning, and evaluating environmental correlates of vector dynamics in Kilombero Valley.
