# Entomological and microclimate data logger data for the Kilombero valley in Tanzania

- Overview
  - Dataset from Kilombero Valley, Tanzania, a global malaria hotspot, collected since 2007 to study malaria vectors.
  - Focuses on four villages: Lupiro, Kidugalo, Minepa, and Sagamaganga.
  - Mosquito specimens identified to species (An. gambiae, An. funestus) and sex/status recorded; linked to on-site microclimate data (temperature, humidity, vapour pressure deficit).
  - Enables exploration of relationships between malaria vector dynamics and environmental conditions over a long period.

- Data collection and design
  - Trapping methods:
    - Indoor CDC light traps (CDCs) inside households.
    - Mosquito Electrocuting Traps (MET) deployed indoors and outdoors per household.
  - Sampling regime:
    - Monthly sampling for one week per village (Mon–Fri); visits at least 5 days per month per village.
    - MET data collected hourly from 18:00 to 06:00; CDC data collected nightly (6 PM–6 AM).
    - Data gaps: MET data missing at study start and for 3 weeks in June 2017 due to equipment issues.
  - Microclimate data:
    - Indoor temperature and humidity logged hourly using Tiny Tag data loggers placed inside houses ~1 m above ground; data downloaded weekly.
    - Used to compute indoor saturation deficit (via Allen et al. 1998).
  - Field instrumentation:
    - CDC traps powered by 12V batteries; MET traps powered by 24V DC with safety protocols for volunteers.
    - Tiny Tag loggers run on lithium batteries (long-term recording possible).
  - Data validation:
    - A subset of mosquitoes tested for malaria parasites; species confirmed with PCR/ELISA.
    - Calibration: Tiny Tag loggers calibrated annually; basic cross-checks done weekly; MET grid voltages checked twice nightly; CDC trap batteries checked at start of each trapping night.

- Data files and structure
  - MET data file: MET_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
  - CDC data file: CDC_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
  - MET data characteristics:
    - 6,280 lines, 26 columns.
    - Key fields: village (three-letter code: KID, MIN, LUP, SAG), village2, traptype (MET), trap, date (DD/MM/YYYY), Month, year, household identifiers (HH, VillageHH), IN.OUT, Time start/end, hourly counts for An. gambiae (Agml, Agfed, Agunfed, Aggrv) and An. funestus (Afml, Affed, Afunfed, Afgrv), other Anopheles (OthAn), and environmental variables (temperature, humidity).
  - CDC data characteristics:
    - 853 lines, 30 columns.
    - Key fields: village, household identifier (villageHH), traptype (CDC), trap, date, Month, year, HH, IN.OUT (CDC trapping indoors), Time start/end, and species counts (Agml, Agfed, Agunf, Aggrv; Afml, Affed, Affunf, Afgrv; Acml, Acfem, OthAn), plus microclimate variables (MeanTemp, MeanHum, MaxTemp, MaxHum, MinTemp, MinHum).
  - Temporal scope: trapping and microclimate data collected between 04/07/2016 and 14/09/2017.
  - Data notes: some days missing due to adverse weather or equipment failure; formatting is comma-separated values (CSV).

- Variables and units (highlights)
  - Mosquito counts by species and sex/status:
    - An. gambiae (Agml, Agfed, Agunfed, Aggrv)
    - An. funestus (Afml, Affed, Afunfed, Afgrv)
    - Other Anopheles (OthAn)
  - Environmental measurements:
    - MET: temperature (°C), humidity (%)
    - CDC: MeanTemp, MeanHum, MaxTemp, MaxHum, MinTemp, MinHum (°C, %)
  - Location and trap identifiers:
    - Village codes (KID, MIN, LUP, SAG)
    - Household identifiers (HH, VillageHH)
    - Trap type (MET or CDC) and trap id
  - Time-related fields:
    - Date (DD/MM/YYYY), Month (e.g., JUL), year, Time start, Time end
    - Indoor/outdoor designation for MET data (IN/OUT); CDC trapping was indoors only

- Quality assurance and calibration
  - Species verification via PCR/ELISA for a subset of specimens.
  - Microclimate loggers calibrated annually; cross-checks performed weekly in a controlled room.
  - MET trap voltages checked twice nightly; CDC trap battery voltage checked at the start of each trapping night.

- Limitations and caveats
  - Missing data periods: MET data incomplete at study start and for three weeks in June 2017; some days may be missing due to weather or equipment failures.
  - Indoor vs outdoor MET data captured, while CDC trapping was indoors; temporal resolution differs between MET (hourly) and CDC (daily) datasets.
  - Data interpretation requires careful alignment of time stamps and calendar periods when linking vector counts to microclimate conditions.

- Potential uses for data leaders
  - Assess associations between malaria vector dynamics and microclimate variables across villages and years.
  - Integrate entomological data with broader data ecosystems to inform malaria control strategies and policy planning.
  - Evaluate data quality, standardization, and metadata practices for cross-project discoverability and reuse.
  - Use as a model for managing data provenance, calibration, and documentation in multi-method field studies.
