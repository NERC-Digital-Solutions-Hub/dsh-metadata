# Entomological and microclimate data logger data for the Kilombero valley in Tanzania

## Data overview
- Global malaria hotspot in Kilombero Valley, Tanzania; four villages studied: Lupiro, Kidugalo, Minepa, Sagamaganga.
- Data collected (2007–2017 project period): trapping of malaria vectors (An. gambiae and An. funestus) with indoor CDC traps and Mosquito Electrocuting Traps (MET) indoors and outdoors.
- Mosquito data: species counts, sex, abdominal status (fed/unfed/gravid), linked to on-site microclimate data when available.
- Microclimate data: temperature, humidity, vapour pressure deficit (on-site readings from weather loggers) linked to mosquito data where possible.
- Two main CSV data files:
  - MET_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
  - CDC_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv

## Data access and licensing
- Licensing terms and full access details available at the dataset DOI: https://doi.org/10.5285/89406b06-d0aa-4120-84dba5f91b616053
- Data stored as comma-separated values (CSV); two separate files for MET and CDC data.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Trapping methods:
  - MET traps: indoor and outdoor traps at selected households; hourly abundance from 18:00 to 06:00.
  - CDC traps: indoor trapping; nightly (18:00–06:00) from households in all villages.
- Sampling cadence: monthly visits to all households in each village for one week (Mon–Fri); data covers at least 5 days per village per month.
- Data completeness: MET data has some early-mstudy gaps and a 3-week gap in June 2017 due to equipment issues.
- Data files contain distinct trap data for MET and CDC with related microclimate variables.

## Data collection, generation, and transformation
- Indoor temperature and humidity: Tiny Tag data loggers placed ~1 m above ground inside houses; data downloaded weekly; used to compute indoor saturation deficit (reference: Allen et al. 1998).
- Field instrumentation:
  - CDC light traps (Model 512) with 12V batteries.
  - MET traps powered by low-voltage DC supply via 12V batteries; four panels form a square with a human volunteer’s legs inside, lethal to mosquitoes attempting to pass wires.
  - Tiny Tag data loggers run on lithium batteries (long-term recording possible).

## Calibration, quality control, and validation
- Mosquito subset tested for malaria parasites and species validation via PCR/ELISA.
- Tiny Tag loggers calibrated annually; weekend intercomparison checks in a single room.
- MET trap panel voltages measured twice nightly; CDC trap battery voltages checked at trapping nights’ start.

## Data format, structure, and units
- MET data file: MET_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
  - 6,280 lines; 26 columns.
  - Key fields include village, traptype (MET), trap, date, month, year, household identifiers, indoor/outdoor indicator, trapping times, counts by species/sex/status (e.g., Agml, Agfed, Agunfed, Aggrv, Afml, Affed, Affunf, Afgrv, Acml, Acfem, OthAn), and site temperature/humidity.
  - Temperature and humidity fields: temperature (C), humidity (%).
- CDC data file: CDC_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
  - 8,53 lines; 30 columns.
  - Key fields include village, villageHH, indoor trapping (IN.OUT always indoor for CDC), trap, date, month, year, household identifiers, trapping times, counts by species/sex/status (e.g., Agml, Agfed, Agunf, Aggrv, Afml, Affed, Affunf, Afgrv, Acml, Acfem, OthAn), and climate metrics (MeanTemp, MeanHum, MaxTemp, MaxHum, MinTemp, MinHum).
- Both datasets use a consistent village/household coding scheme to enable linkage across MET and CDC data and to microclimate measurements.

## Data quality, limitations, and notes
- Missing data: some days missing due to adverse weather or equipment failure; MET data missing at study start and for 3 weeks in June 2017.
- Data notes field: includes other comments (e.g., animals around households or trap malfunctions) that may affect interpretation.
- Units: temperatures in Celsius; humidity in percent; other variables documented within each file’s definitions.

## Relevance for data work and potential analyses
- Data can be joined across MET and CDC datasets by village, household, date/time windows, and indoor/outdoor context, with microclimate variables enabling environmental correlation analyses.
- Potential analyses and data products:
  - Time-series dashboards of vector counts by species, trap type, and location.
  - Relationship analysis between mosquito abundance and microclimate (temperature, humidity, saturation deficit).
  - Indoor vs outdoor contrasts and vector species composition across villages.
  - Temporal patterns (hourly MET data) versus daily CDC data to study activity windows and vector behavior.
  - Data quality dashboards to monitor missing data and equipment-related gaps.
- This dataset supports exploration of malaria vector dynamics in relation to environmental conditions, with potential public-health and policy implications for vector control strategies.
