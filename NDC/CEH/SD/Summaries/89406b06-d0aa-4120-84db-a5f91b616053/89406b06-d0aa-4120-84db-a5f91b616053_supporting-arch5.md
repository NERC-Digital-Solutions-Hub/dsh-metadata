# Entomological and microclimate data logger data for the Kilombero valley in Tanzania

## Overview
- Dataset documenting malaria vector trapping and microclimate data in Kilombero Valley, Tanzania, an area of global malaria interest.
- Long-term collaboration (since 2007) between IHI and University of Glasgow.
- Data linked to on-site microclimate measurements (temperature, humidity, vapour pressure deficit) to explore relationships between vector dynamics and environment.
- Four villages involved: Lupiro, Kidugalo, Minepa, Sagamaganga.

## Data content and structure
- Two CSV data files:
  - MET_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
  - CDC_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
- MET dataset (hourly data, 18:00–06:00): 6280 lines, 26 columns; records for each location/time point with trap type, species counts, and local microclimate variables.
- CDC dataset (daily data, per-night trapping): 853 lines, 30 columns; similar fields plus daily mean/max/min temperature and humidity metrics.
- Key fields across both files include:
  - Village identifiers (KID, MIN, LUP, SAG), household identifiers (VillageHH), trap type (MET or CDC), trap and time identifiers, date, month, year, indoor/outdoor status, and trapping time windows.
  - Mosquito counts by species and status (e.g., An. gambiae, An. funestus; male/female; fed/unfed/gravid).
  - Environmental readings: temperature and humidity; for CDC file additional mean/max/min values.

## Data collection methods
- Trapping methods:
  - Indoor CDC light traps deployed overnight inside households.
  - Mosquito Electrocuting Traps (MET) deployed indoors and outdoors; hourly sampling from 18:00 to 06:00.
- Sampling schedule:
  - All households in a village sampled monthly for one week (Mon–Fri); each village visited at least 5 days per month.
  - MET data has some early-study and June 2017 gaps due to equipment issues.
- Environmental data collection:
  - Indoor temperature and humidity recorded hourly using Tiny Tag data loggers placed ~1 m above ground; data downloaded weekly.
  - Indoor saturation deficit calculated using established equations (Allen et al., 1998).

## Data quality, calibration, and QA
- Species identification validated on a subset via malaria parasite testing and PCR/ELISA.
- Calibration and quality control:
  - Tiny Tag loggers calibrated annually; weekly cross-checks by placing all loggers in the same room.
  - MET trap panel voltages checked twice nightly; CDC trap batteries checked at start of each trapping night.
- Documentation notes: occasional missing days due to weather or equipment failure; some entries include notes on malfunction or animals present.

## Data formats and field definitions
- Storage format: comma-separated values (CSV).
- MET dataset specifics:
  - 26 columns, including village, traptype (MET), trap, date, month, year, household, IN.OUT, time windows, and counts for multiple Anopheles species (e.g., Agml, Agfed, Agunfed, Aggrv; Afml, Affed, Affunf, Afgrv; Acml, Acfem; OthAn) plus environmental variables (temperature, humidity).
- CDC dataset specifics:
  - 30 columns, including similar demographic/trap fields, but with indoor-only trapping for CDC, plus daily mean/max/min temperature and humidity.

- Supporting information and context:
  - Data referenced in Kreppel et al. (2018); methodology anchored to established evapotranspiration guidelines (Allen et al., 1998).

## Limitations and considerations for reuse
- Temporal coverage gaps:
  - MET data missing at the beginning of the study and for three weeks in June 2017.
  - Data can be incomplete due to adverse weather conditions or equipment failure.
- Format considerations:
  - Data stored as CSVs with detailed column descriptions; users should review code mappings for village codes and household identifiers.
- Scope:
  - Data are specific to four villages in Kilombero Valley and period 2016–2017; suitability for longitudinal malaria-vector-environment analyses depends on alignment with research questions and required metadata.
