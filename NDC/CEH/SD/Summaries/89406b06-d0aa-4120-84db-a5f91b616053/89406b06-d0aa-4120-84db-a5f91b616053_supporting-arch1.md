# Entomological and microclimate data logger data for the Kilombero valley in Tanzania

## Overview and purpose
- Kilombero Valley in Tanzania is a global malaria hotspot.
- Long-running study (since 2007) trapping primary malaria vectors (An. gambiae, An. funestus) across four villages: Lupiro, Kidugalo, Minepa, Sagamaganga.
- Data link mosquito captures (species, sex, abdominal status) with site microclimate measurements (temperature, humidity, vapour pressure deficit) to explore relationships between vector dynamics and environmental conditions.
- Datasets support analyses of vector ecology, malaria risk, and environment-driven transmission patterns.

## Study design and sampling regime
- Trapping methods:
  - Indoor trapping with standard CDC light traps.
  - Mosquito Electrocuting Traps (MET) deployed indoors and outdoors.
- Sampling frequency:
  - All households in a village sampled monthly for one week (Mon–Fri).
  - MET data collected hourly from 18:00 to 06:00; CDC data collected nightly 18:00–06:00.
- Locations:
  - Four villages: Lupiro (LUP), Kidugalo (KID), Minepa (MIN), Sagamaganga (SAG).
- Data file sources:
  - MET data: ET_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
  - CDC data: CDC_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
- Data gaps:
  - MET data missing at the start of the study and for 3 weeks in June 2017 due to equipment issues.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Mosquito identification:
  - Species identified to species level; An. gambiae and An. funestus recorded.
  - Sex (male/female) and abdominal status (fed/unfed) documented.
- Microclimate measurements:
  - Indoor temperature and humidity recorded with Tiny Tag data loggers (hourly).
  - Used to compute indoor saturation deficit using established methods (Allen et al. 1998).
- Trapping equipment:
  - MET: four 35 × 35 cm panels forming a square to trap volunteers’ legs; electrically charged to kill mosquitoes on contact without harm to volunteers.
  - CDC traps: standard light traps with 12 V batteries.

## Data formats, variables, and units
- MET dataset (MET_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv):
  - 6280 lines, 26 columns.
  - Key fields: village (KID/MIN/LUP/SAG), village2, traptype (MET), trap, date (DD/MM/YYYY), Month, year, household identifiers (HH, VillageHH), IN.OUT (indoor/outdoor), Time start/end, counts for An. gambiae (Agml, Agfed, Agunfed, Aggrv) and An. funestus (Afml, Affed, Afunfed, Afgrv), OthAn, temperature, humidity.
  - Temperature and humidity on site (float; °C and % respectively).
- CDC dataset (CDC_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv):
  - 853 lines, 30 columns.
  - Key fields: village, villageHH, traptype (CDC), trap, date, Month, year, HH, IN.OUT (indoor trapping only for CDC), Time start/end, counts for An. gambiae (Agml, Agfed, Agunf, Aggrv) and An. funestus (Afml, Affed, Affunf, Afgrv), other species (OthAn), environmental variables (MeanTemp, MeanHum, MaxTemp, MaxHum, MinTemp, MinHum).
- Common notes:
  - Village codes: KID, MIN, LUP, SAG; household identifiers combine village and household number (e.g., SAG1).
  - All data stored as comma-separated files.

## Calibration, quality control, and data quality
- Species identification validation:
  - Subset of mosquitoes tested for malaria parasites and species confirmation via PCR/ELISA.
- Instrument calibration:
  - Tiny Tag data loggers calibrated annually; weekly inter-checks to ensure consistent readings.
  - MET trap voltages checked twice nightly; CDC trap batteries checked at start of each trapping night.
- Data limitations:
  - Some days have missing data due to adverse weather or equipment failure.
  - Indoor CDC trapping was consistently indoors; MET provided indoor and outdoor data with occasional gaps.

## Potential uses for analysts
- Correlate malaria vector abundance with microclimate variables (temperature, humidity, saturation deficit) across villages and trapping methods.
- Develop predictive models of vector dynamics and malaria risk under varying environmental conditions.
- Compare indoor vs. outdoor vector activity and the effectiveness of trapping methods.
- Integrate with additional datasets to examine scale-up insights from local village to broader regional contexts.
