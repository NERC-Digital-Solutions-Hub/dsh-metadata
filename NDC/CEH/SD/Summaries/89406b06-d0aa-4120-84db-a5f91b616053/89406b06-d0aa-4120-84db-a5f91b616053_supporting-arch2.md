# Entomological and microclimate data logger data for the Kilombero valley in Tanzania

## Overview
- Long-running study in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania, a malaria hotspot.
- Data collected from four villages (Lupiro, Kidugalo, Minepa, Sagamaganga) to relate malaria vector dynamics to environmental conditions.
- Two trapping methods used: indoor Mosquito Electrocuting Traps (MET) and indoor CDC light traps; data linked to microclimate measurements.
- Timeframe: sampling conducted from July 2016 to September 2017; daily/hourly data linked to on-site weather variables (temperature, humidity, vapour pressure deficit when available).

## Data collection and study design
- Sampling regime: monthly household visits across all villages for one week (Monday–Friday); households sampled each month, ensuring at least 5 visit days per village.
- Trapping details:
  - MET traps deployed indoors and outdoors (one trap per household per site).
  - CDC traps used indoors only.
  - Abundance estimates for mosquito species recorded hourly (MET) or daily (CDC) during trapping periods.
- Field devices:
  - Indoor microclimate measured using Tiny Tag data loggers placed ~1 m above ground; data downloaded weekly.
  - MET panels monitored for voltage; calibration and checks performed regularly.
- Data gaps:
  - MET data missing at the start of the study and for about 3 weeks in June 2017 due to equipment issues.
  - CDC data complete for the specified sampling windows but can have day-to-day gaps due to weather/equipment.

## Data content and format
- Two primary CSV data files:
  - MET_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
    - 6,280 lines, 26 columns
    - Variables include village, village code, trap type (MET), trap/time identifiers, date, month, year, household identifiers, IN.OUT (indoor/outdoor), trapping time windows, Anopheles species counts (e.g., Agml, Agfed, Agunfed, Aggrv; Afml, Affed, Affunf, Afgrv), other Anopheles data, and on-site temperature/humidity (temperature, humidity).
    - Indoor/outdoor microclimate data tied to MET trapping times.
  - CDC_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
    - 853 lines, 30 columns
    - Variables include village, villageHH, indoor trapping (IN), trap/time identifiers, date, month, year, household, and indoor trapping times, species counts (e.g., Agml, Agfed, Agunf, Aggrv; Afml, Affed, Affunf, Afgrv; Acml, Acfem; OthAn), notes, and mean/min/max temperature and humidity on site (MeanTemp, MeanHum, MaxTemp, MaxHum, MinTemp, MinHum).
- Data format: comma-separated values; notes field included for additional comments; date formats and time windows standardized to trapping periods (evening to early morning).

## Quality assurance and calibration
- Species verification: subset of mosquitoes tested for malaria parasites and species confirmation via PCR/ELISA to validate field identifications.
- Instrument calibration:
  - Tiny Tag data loggers calibrated annually; periodic checks by placing all loggers in the same room to confirm consistency.
  - MET trap panel voltages checked twice nightly with voltmeters.
  - CDC trap batteries checked at the start of each trapping night.
- Data integrity considerations: data can be missing due to adverse weather conditions or equipment failures; documentation of missing days is included in the dataset.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and analysis
- Enables investigation of relationships between malaria vector dynamics and on-site environmental conditions.
- Standardised, machine-readable dataset suitable for time-series analyses, spatial comparisons across villages, and integration with other environmental datasets.
- Outputs can support environmental health monitoring, vector-control policy evaluation, and malaria transmission risk modeling.

## Limitations and considerations for use
- Data gaps: MET data incomplete at study start and for ~3 weeks in June 2017; CDC data largely complete within the documented period but may contain occasional gaps due to field conditions.
- Indoor microclimate data are tied to specific houses and nights; extrapolation beyond measured locations should be done cautiously.
- Vapour pressure deficit data are noted as available when possible; not always present for all records.

## How to use
- Combine MET and CDC vector counts with indoor microclimate variables to model vector abundance against environmental conditions.
- Use village-level identifiers (KID, MIN, LUP, SAG) and household codes (VillageHH) to explore micro-spatial patterns.
- Leverage calibration and QA notes to assess data reliability and to filter records with potential instrument-related anomalies.
