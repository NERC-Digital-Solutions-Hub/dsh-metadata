# Entomological and microclimate data logger data for the Kilombero valley in Tanzania

## Overview
- Dataset linking malaria vector data (An. gambiae and An. funestus) with microclimate data logger readings (temperature, humidity, vapour pressure deficit).
- Collected in four Kilombero Valley villages: Lupiro, Kidugalo, Minepa, Sagamaganga.
- Timeframe for this dataset: project activity described around 2016–2017; continuous malaria vector monitoring since 2007.
- Data support examining relationships between vector dynamics and environmental conditions; intended to inform monitoring and policy decisions.

## Data collection design and methods
- Trapping methods:
  - Indoor CDC light traps (CDC traps) deployed inside households.
  - Mosquito Electrocuting Traps (MET) used indoors and outdoors; traps run hourly from 18:00 to 06:00.
- Sampling regime:
  - All households in each village sampled monthly for one week (Mon–Fri), ensuring visits in each village at least 5 days per month.
  - MET data collection began with some early data gaps due to equipment issues.
- Data linkage:
  - When available, daily mosquito data linked to on-site microclimate data (weather conditions including temperature, humidity, vapour pressure deficit).

## Data types and structure
- Two CSV data files:
  - MET_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
  - CDC_host_seeking_mosquitoes_and_MClim_data_NERC.csv
- MET dataset:
  - 6,280 lines, 26 columns.
  - Key fields: village, village2, traptype (MET), trap, date (DD/MM/YYYY), Month, year, household identifiers, IN.OUT (Indoor/Outdoor), Time start/end, counts for An. gambiae and An. funestus (male and female, fed/unfed/gravid), OthAn, and environment: temperature, humidity.
- CDC dataset:
  - 853 lines, 30 columns.
  - Key fields: village, villageHH, traptype (CDC), trap, date, Month, year, HH, IN.OUT (always Indoor for CDC), Time start/end, mosquito counts by species/sex/status, and environmental metrics: MeanTemp, MeanHum, MaxTemp, MaxHum, MinTemp, MinHum.
- Village codes: KID (Kidugalo), MIN (Minepa), LUP (Lupiro), SAG (Sagamaganga).
- Data stored as comma-separated values (CSV).

## Data collection instruments and quality control
- Indoor temperature and humidity:
  - Tiny Tag plus 2 loggers placed inside houses (~1 m above ground); data downloaded weekly.
  - Loggers calibrated annually; weekly inter-comparisons conducted.
- MET traps:
  - Four 35 × 35 cm panels forming a square; electric grid powered by 24 V battery, designed to kill mosquitoes on contact without harming volunteers.
  - Grid voltage checked twice nightly; batteries checked at start of trapping night.
- CDC traps:
  - Model 512 light traps with 12 V batteries; operated nightly 6 pm–6 am.
- Species verification and data quality:
  - Subset of collected mosquitoes tested for malaria parasites and species confirmation via PCR/ELISA.
  - Data quality assurance includes calibration of loggers and hardware, with notes on potential data gaps due to equipment issues.

## Data format, values, and metadata
- File format: CSV for both MET and CDC datasets.
- Variables include:
  - Location identifiers (village, villageHH), sampling details (trap type, trap ID, date, time windows), counts by species and sex/status (e.g., Agml, Agfed, Agunfed, Aggrv, Afml, Affed, Affunf, Afgrv, Acml, Acfem, OthAn), and environmental readings (temperature, humidity).
  - For CDC data: indoor trapping only; Mean/Max/Min temperatures and humidity recorded on site.
- Environmental units:
  - Temperature in Celsius; Humidity in percent; other derived measures (e.g., indoor saturation deficit) derived from the data.

## Considerations for monitoring framework usage
- Strengths:
  - Provides linked vector and microclimate data across indoor and outdoor settings, enabling analysis of environmental drivers of malaria vector dynamics.
  - Includes explicit QA/QC steps (species verification, loggers calibration, trap maintenance) and detailed metadata.
- Challenges and limitations:
  - Missing MET data at the start of the study and a 3-week gap in June 2017; other days may be missing due to weather or equipment failure.
  - Data aggregation requires careful alignment of MET and CDC datasets by village, household, date, and time window.
  - Public sharing requirements of underlying data may affect immediate reuse in some contexts.
- Governance considerations:
  - Clear metadata and calibration records support data governance; datasets are prepared for sharing with appropriate licensing and citation requirements.
  - Encourages standardized data management practices (sharing underlying data where appropriate, transparency about data gaps).
