# MM Protocol

## Aim
- Conduct standard meteorological observations according to the British Meteorological Office (BMO) protocols.
- Preserve continuity of historic data and provide calibration/back-up for ECN automatic weather stations (AWS).

## Rationale
- Aligns ECN sites with established meteorological standards and historic datasets.
- Supports data quality, comparability across sites, and back-up for AWS measurements.

## Equipment and Method
- Instruments per BMO standards, including:
  - Large Stevenson screen with iron stand; dry/wet bulb thermometers; max/min and grass minimum thermometers; soil thermometers at 30 cm and 100 cm; Octapent rain gauge Mk2A; run-of-wind counter anemometer.
  - Possible BSI-certified thermometers where applicable.
- Location
  - Manual station colocated with AWS where possible; if a Meteorological Office Climatological Station exists, adjacency to ECN instruments may vary.
- Operation
  - Follow the Observers' Handbook (Meteorological Office 1982) and BMO standards.
  - BMO personnel perform periodic field calibration for Climatological Stations.
  - ECN sites read data weekly on Wednesdays at 0900 GMT; existing BMO Climatological Stations record daily.
  - Monthly data sheets (as submitted to BMO) are shared with the ECN Data Manager; QC queries directed to ECN Data Manager.
  - If sites already record sunshine hours, snow depth, or soil temperatures for non-ECN purposes, share these data with ECN Data Manager.

## Time and Data Recording
- Core observations recorded daily at 0900 GMT; weekly sites have a 1 hour/month periodicity for recording.

## Data Recording Conventions and Formats
- Core variables must be captured with standardized identifiers:
  - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Recording date/time (GMT).
- Core measurements (meteorology – manual) recorded daily at 0900 GMT:
  - Dry bulb temp, Wet bulb temp, Maximum temp, Minimum temp, Grass minimum temp, Soil temp 30 cm, Soil temp 100 cm, Rainfall total, Wind run total.
- Recording time, units (C for temperatures; mm for rainfall; km for wind run), and precision are specified in the protocol.
- Data submission formats align with ECNCCU datasets; specific format documentation is available via the restricted ECN extranet (Data Transfer documentation). Access requests to ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.

## Recording Forms
- Use the British Meteorological Office recording form 3208B and instruction booklet 3100A.
- Refer to the Meteorological Office Handbook (1982) for procedures.
