# Climatic data (Meteorological Office recordings) from four sites along an altitudinal gradient in Cumbria. 1952 - 1990

## Overview
- Climatic dataset from four sites along an altitudinal gradient in Cumbria, spanning 1952–1990.
- Collected according to standard Meteorological Office procedures (Observer's Handbook, 4th ed., 1982).
- Data stored in a database described by Cuthbertson (1993); supporting documentation available as MM.pdf.

- Additional descriptors: SUNSHINE (hours), THUNDER/GALE/FOG indicators, VISCODE (visibility codes)

## Data management and provenance
- Data collected following Meteorological Office procedures; QA and transformation steps implied to ensure data quality.
- Stored in a database described in Cuthbertson (1993); associated with supporting MM.pdf.
- Dataset includes a DATID identifier linking data to the dataset record.

## Temporal coverage
- Overall span: 1952–1990, with site-specific ranges as listed above.

## Access and related work
- The UK Environmental Change Network has continued monitoring at Moor House (1980s onward) with meteorology data for 1991–2015 (Rennie et al. 2017; DOI provided).

## Relevance for environmental analytics
- Provides standardized, long-term climatic observations across an altitudinal gradient to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Outputs can be generated in formats like reports, maps, and charts; underlying data can be stored in appropriate portals for reuse.

## Opportunities and challenges
- Challenges:
  - Increase value by integrating these datasets with other relevant environmental data (avoiding single-use limitation)
  - Improve access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs
- Opportunities:
  - Enhance data interoperability and reuse across monitoring programs and policy analyses
