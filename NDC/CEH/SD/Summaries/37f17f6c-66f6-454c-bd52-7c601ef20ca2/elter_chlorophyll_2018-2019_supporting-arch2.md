# Elter_chlorophyll_2018-2019.txt

- Purpose: Weekly to monthly vertical profiles of chlorophyll a to monitor environmental condition in the Elterwater inner basin over May 2018 to December 2019.

- Location: Deepest point of Elterwater inner basin (Latitude 54.4287°, Longitude -3.0350°).

- Sampling frequency and period: Weekly to monthly sampling from May 2018 to December 2019.

- Sample collection: Water samples of 500 mL collected at depths of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 meters.

- Filtration and preservation: Immediately after collection, samples filtered through a 5.5 cm GF/C filter paper; the filter paper was Frozen and the sample analyzed within a month.

- Laboratory analysis: Chlorophyll a extraction by heated methanol extraction; analysis with a spectrophotometer.

- Spectrophotometer wavelengths: 750 nm for background turbidity, 665 nm for the red absorbance maximum of chlorophyll a.

- Calculation of chlorophyll a concentration: Chlorophyll a concentration = (13.9 × A_corr665 × 1/d) × (v/V), where A_corr665 = A_corr665 − A_corr750, d is cuvette pathlength (cm), V is the volume of sample filtered (mL), and v is the volume of extract (mL).

- Data structure: Date (yyyy-mm-dd), Depth (m), Concentration (μg L^-1).
