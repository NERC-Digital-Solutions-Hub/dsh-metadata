# Elter_dissolved_oxygen_2018-2019.txt

## Overview
- Daily average dissolved oxygen concentration (DO_conc, μg L -1) measured at Elterwater Inner basin's deepest point (Lat: 54.4287°, Long: -3.0350°).
- Time period: May 2018 to December 2019.
- Depths measured: 3 m and 5 m from the surface.
- Sampling cadence: every 15 minutes.
- Instrumentation: PME miniDOT oxygen sensors (Precision Measurement Engineering, Vista, California, USA).

## Measurement Method
- DO concentrations measured via fluorescence.
- Sensor accuracy: 0.3 mg L -1.
- Sensors equipped with anti-fouling wipers to reduce biofilm growth on the optical sensor.

## Data Processing
- Raw data (15-minute intervals) daily averaged.
- Small gaps in QCed data were linearly interpolated (< 3 hours).

## Data Structure
- Columns: Date (yyyy-mm-dd), Depth (m), DO_conc (μg L -1).
