# Elter_light_2018-2019.txt

- Overview
  - Weekly to monthly vertical profiles of underwater PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) collected from May 2018 to December 2019.
  - Profiles are taken at the deepest point of Elterwater inner basin.

- Location
  - Deepest point of Elterwater inner basin.
  - Coordinates: Latitude 54.4287°, Longitude -3.0350°.

- Method and frequency
  - Instrument: LI-COR LI-192 underwater quantum sensor.
  - Measurement: PAR readings at half-meter depth intervals from 0.5 to 6 m.
  - Frequency: Profiles collected weekly to monthly.
  - Quality check: Measurements were visually inspected for plausibility.

- Data structure and variables
  - Columns: Date (yyyy-mm-dd), Depth (m), Light (μmol s^-1 m^-2, i.e., PAR).

- Timeframe
  - May 2018 to December 2019.

- Data quality and caveats
  - Visual inspection used for quality assurance; no additional automated validation described.
  - Limited to the deepest point in a single basin; may not generalize to other locations or depths beyond 6 m.
  - Profile-based data with potential gaps due to sampling frequency or operational constraints.

- Potential uses for analysts
  - Assess depth-dependent attenuation of PAR and its temporal changes.
  - Explore correlations between PAR at various depths and seasonal/solar variations.
  - Combine with other environmental data to model light availability for photosynthetic activity in Elterwater.

- Notes on data handling
  - Data are organized as Date, Depth, and Light, enabling reconstruction of vertical PAR profiles over time.
