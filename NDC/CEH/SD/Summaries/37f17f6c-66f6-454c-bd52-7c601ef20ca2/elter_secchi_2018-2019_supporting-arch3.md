# Elter_Secchi_2018-2019.txt

## Overview
- Secchi extinction depths (in meters) collected at Elterwater Inner basin's deepest point.
- Spatial coordinates: Lat 54.4287°, Long -3.0350°.
- Timeframe: May 2018 to December 2019.
- Measurement purpose: indicator of water clarity for environmental health monitoring.

## Data details
- Data fields: Date (yyyy-mm-dd), Secchi (m).
- Instrument: oceanographic Secchi disk (all white).

## Sampling protocol
- Measurement frequency:
  - Weekly during the stratified period (May–October).
  - Monthly outside the stratified period.

## Data quality and governance considerations (implications for monitoring)
- Clear, timestamped depth measurements enable trend analysis of water clarity.
- Data structure is simple (Date and Secchi depth), facilitating integration into dashboards or reports.
- Metadata completeness and accessibility are important for reuse and verification.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Provides a tangible environmental health metric (water visibility/clarity) that can be used to assess ecosystem status and inform policy decisions.
- Useful for evaluating changes over time and potential responses to management actions at Elterwater.
