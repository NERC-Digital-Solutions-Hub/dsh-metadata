# Elter_Secchi_2018-2019.txt

- ## Overview
  - Secchi extinction depths collected at Elterwater Inner basin's deepest point (lat 54.4287, lon -3.0350) from May 2018 to December 2019.
  - Depths measured weekly during the stratified period (May–Oct) and monthly outside this period.
  - Instrument: oceanographic Secchi disk (all white).

- ## Geographic Context
  - Site: Elterwater Inner basin, deepest point.
  - Coordinates: 54.4287 N, -3.0350 W.

- ## Temporal Coverage
  - Timeframe: May 2018 to December 2019.

- ## Sampling Design
  - Frequency: weekly during stratified months (May–Oct); monthly outside stratified period.
  - Purpose: track water transparency over time with higher resolution in warmer months.

- ## Measurements and Instrumentation
  - Variable: Secchi depth (water transparency).
  - Unit: meters (m).
  - Instrument: oceanographic Secchi disk (all white).

- ## Data Structure
  - Columns: Date (YYYY-MM-DD), Secchi (m).

- ## Data Quality and Metadata Considerations
  - Includes precise site coordinates; temporal resolution varies by season.
  - Data format is a two-column time-series table suitable for trend analysis of water transparency.
