# Elter_Secchi_2018-2019.txt

## Overview
- Secchi extinction depths (in meters) collected at Elterwater Inner basin's deepest point.
- Location coordinates: Lat 54.4287°, Long -3.0350°.
- Study period: May 2018 to December 2019.
- Purpose: quantify water transparency over time.

## Sampling and Schedule
- Depths collected weekly during the stratified period (May–October).
- Depths collected monthly outside the stratified period (November–April).

## Instrumentation
- Secchi disk type: oceanographic Secchi (all white).

## Data Structure
- Columns: Date (YYYY-MM-DD), Secchi (m).

## Potential Uses for Analysis
- Time-series analysis of lake transparency and seasonal patterns.
- Investigation of trends across the 2018–2019 window and correlation with stratification dynamics.
- Basis for comparisons with other sites or longer-term datasets.

## Data Considerations and Quality Notes
- Single-site data; limited spatial coverage.
- Temporal gaps possible due to the change in sampling frequency across seasons.
- Metadata depth is provided (date and Secchi depth), but additional metadata (e.g., observer, measurement protocol nuances) is not stated.
