# Elter_Secchi_2018-2019.txt

## Overview
- Secchi depth measurements collected at Elterwater Inner basin’s deepest point (Lat: 54.4287, Long: -3.0350).
- Timeframe: May 2018 to December 2019.
- Purpose: quantify water transparency over time.

## Data Content and Structure
- Variables:
  - Date (yyyy-mm-dd)
  - Secchi (m) – depth in meters
- Instrument: oceanographic Secchi disk (all white)

## Spatial and Temporal Coverage
- Location: Elterwater Inner basin, deepest point
- Temporal pattern:
  - Weekly measurements during the stratified period (May–October)
  - Monthly measurements outside this period

## Data Quality and Provenance Considerations
- Consistent measurement approach: Secchi depth with a single instrument type noted.
- Units: Secchi depth recorded in meters; ensure consistent unit handling across records.
- Temporal consistency: varying sampling frequency (weekly vs monthly) to be reflected in metadata and any analyses.
- Potential gaps: non-weekly periods may introduce uneven temporal coverage; verify for missing dates or incomplete records.

## Metadata and Documentation Needs
- Current structure includes Date and Secchi (m); augment with:
  - Location coordinates (lat/long) as explicit fields
  - Instrument details and measurement protocol
  - Data collector or responsible entity
  - Data collection cadence and any deviations from plan
  - Uncertainty or measurement errors, if available

## Access, Sharing, and Updates
- Description does not specify data repository or access conditions.
- Best practice: document data portal, licensing, and update cadence; establish versioning and provenance tracking.

## Data Stewardship Implications and Actions
- Ensure accurate, machine-readable dates and numeric Secchi values.
- Maintain a clear data dictionary outlining variable names, units, and allowable ranges.
- Preserve metadata completeness (location, method, cadence, personnel).
- Validate and document any anomalies (e.g., unusually large or negative Secchi values).
- Plan for data publication in appropriate portals and define an update schedule if data collection continues beyond 2019.
