# Elter_Secchi_2018-2019.txt

- Purpose and content: Secchi extinction depths (in meters) collected at Elterwater Inner basin's deepest point to assess water transparency from May 2018 to December 2019.
- Location: Point at Lat 54.4287°, Lon -3.0350° (Elterwater Inner basin).
- Temporal coverage and sampling frequency:
  - Period: May 2018 through December 2019
  - Sampling frequency: weekly during the stratified period (May–Oct); monthly outside this period (Nov–Apr)
- Measurement details:
  - Instrument: oceanographic Secchi disk (all white)
  - Data fields: Date (YYYY-MM-DD), Secchi (m)
- Data structure and format:
  - Tabular dataset with two columns (Date, Secchi); suitable for CSV, and can be exported to GIS-friendly formats (shapefile, GeoJSON) with time attributes
- GIS considerations:
  - Create a time-enabled point layer using the site coordinates with attributes: date and secchi_m
  - CRS: likely WGS84 (EPSG:4326); reproject as needed for analysis
  - Potential analyses: time-series visualization of transparency at a single site; animation/time-slider displays; integration with other lake/water-quality layers
- Data quality and limitations:
  - Single monitoring location; limited spatial coverage
  - Temporal gaps outside weekly periods; consistency depends on measurement protocol across years
- Processing and use recommendations:
  - Ensure proper date parsing and units (meters)
  - Annotate metadata with measurement method, instrument, and period of record
  - Consider aggregations (e.g., monthly means, seasonal summaries) for broader analyses
  - Handle missing values explicitly in GIS/analysis workflows
