# Elter_T_profiles_2018-2019.txt

## Overview
- Hourly average water temperature data for Elterwater Inner basin’s deepest point.
- Time period: 2018-01-01 00:00:00 to 2019-12-31 23:00:00.
- Depths measured: 1–6 meters below surface; data initially at 4-minute intervals.
- Location coordinates: Lat 54.4287°, Long -3.0350°.
- Sensor: RBRsoloT; accuracy ±0.002 °C.

## Data Processing and Structure
- Raw data at 4-minute intervals were hourly averaged.
- Small data gaps (if any) were linearly interpolated, typically less than 2 hours.
- File structure: DateTime (yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS), T_1m (°C), T_2m (°C), T_3m (°C), T_4m (°C), T_5m (°C), T_6m (°C).

## Data Quality and Provenance
- Temperature readings derived from calibrated sensors with high accuracy.
- Processing includes hourly averaging and minor linear interpolation for gaps.
- Clear documentation of measurement depths and timestamp format supports reproducibility.

## Spatial and Temporal Coverage
- Spatial: single monitoring point at Elterwater Inner basin deepest location.
- Temporal: two-year period spanning 2018 and 2019 with hourly-averaged values.

## Governance, Sharing, and Metadata Considerations
- Metadata provided includes coordinates, depths, time range, sensor type, and accuracy.
- Data presented in a structured, tabular format suitable for repository upload and cataloguing.
- Potential considerations for sharing: verify data licensing, update policy, and versioning; confirm time zone, data stewardship contact, and any embargo or proprietary constraints (not specified).
