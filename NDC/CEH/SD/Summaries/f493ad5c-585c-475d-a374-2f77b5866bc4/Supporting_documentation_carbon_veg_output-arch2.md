- Abstract: a dataset of modelled vegetation carbon output from the land surface model JULES, plus temperature and rainfall inputs, at monthly 1.5 km resolution; four JULES simulations using two climate projections under constant present-day CO2 and under a SRES A1B CO2 pathway.

- Background: simulations driven by downscaled climatological data from HadRM3-PPE-UK (25 km to 1.5 km grid) with a constant and varying CO2 pathway; four simulations total. HadRM3-PPE-UK standard configuration used (climate sensitivity 3.5 K) and an ensemble member with the highest sensitivity (7.1 K). Present-day CO2 = 386.5 ppm; SRES A1B CO2 pathway applied.

- Quality control: JULES is a community-developed land surface model led by the UK Met Office and Centre for Ecology and Hydrology; data generated with model version vn4.9; model configuration documented in Rose suite u-ao645, branch 'transient_25km_drive' (registration required to access).

- Details of data structure: data stored as NetCDF (.nc) files containing latitude/longitude grids, monthly midpoints time series, and the corresponding dataset values. Directory structure includes 35K and 71K climatologies, each with Const_CO2 and CO2 subdirectories; each subdirectory contains 3 .nc files (e.g., Temp_35K_Const_CO2.nc).

- Relevance to environmental monitoring: provides standardized, reproducible climate-vegetation data at high spatial (1.5 km) and temporal (monthly) resolution for multiple CO2 scenarios, suitable for mapping, charts, and assessments of vegetation carbon under climate change.

- Data stewardship and accessibility considerations: emphasizes data provenance, quality assurance, and storage/upload to appropriate portals to enable others to access underlying data used for outputs.
