# The nitrogen policy arena for South Asia

## Aim
- To collect and analyze nitrogen-related policies in South Asia to identify gaps and opportunities for managing reactive nitrogen (Nr).
- To provide a starting point for understanding what policies exist, informing future needs, and assessing policy performance over time.

## Scope and dataset
- Policy corpus: 966 nitrogen-relevant policies valid in 2019, collected during 2020–2021.
- Countries covered: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka (country totals shown in Table 1).
  - Afghanistan: 89
  - Bangladesh: 187
  - Bhutan: 60
  - India: 192
  - Maldives: 40
  - Nepal: 108
  - Pakistan: 175
  - Sri Lanka: 115
- Policy types include legislation, acts, laws, regulations, plans, strategies, standards, rules, codes, guidelines, etc.
- Sectors and sub-sectors covered: agriculture, land use, environment, human health, marine, urban development, water and waste management, transport, energy, industry; responsible ministries identified to aid searches.
- Data sources: 55% from FAOLEX (and ECOLEX), 45% from other sources (government and ministry websites, etc.).
- Metadata captured for each policy: title, year, data source, Rec.Id (if FAOLEX), URL, document type, country, territorial level (national/sub-national), language, and responsible ministry.

## Methods

### Collection
- Policies collected from multiple online sources, with descriptive information stored in spreadsheets.

### Filtering
- Relevance determined by sector/sub-sector connection and keywords (e.g., fertilizer, nitrogen pollution, nutrient pollution).
- Policies clustered to distinguish core ("central node" such as Acts/Laws/strategies) from subordinate, amendments, repeals, or replacements. Amendments with substantial new nitrogen content kept as separate entries; minor amendments clustered to core policies.

### Classification
- Policies coded by: environmental sink, sector and sub-sector, policy type, pollution source type, impact direction, impact scope, and relevance.
- Classification followed the Kanter et al. (2020) global framework, with additional categories as needed.
- Classification definitions include:
  - Sinks: Water, Air, Climate, Soil, Ecosystem, Multiple, NA
  - Sectors: Agriculture, Energy, Food, Industry, Land Use Change, Transport, Urban Development & Tourism, Waste, Other, Multiple, NA
  - Policy types: Regulatory, Economic, Framework, Data & Methods, R&D, Commerce, Pro-nitrogen
  - Pollution type: Point source, Non-point source, Both, Unspecified, NA
  - Impact direction: Positive, Mixed/Neutral, Negative
  - Impact scope: Large, Medium, Small
  - Relevance: High (direct), Medium (indirect)
- Key words guiding relevance include fertilizer, nitrogen, nitrate/nitrite, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, eutrophication, water/air quality, greenhouse gases, etc.

## Quality control and governance
- Integrated, interdisciplinary approach with a core coordination team to ensure consistency and alignment with the broader policy analysis framework.
- Online biweekly meetings, training, and one-on-one discussions to build uniform capacity across partners.
- Policy datasets were quality-checked by coordinators and external reviewers (including Kanter) to ensure accurate filtering and classification.
- Local partners contributed to data collection and language considerations, enabling broader coverage.

## Outputs and key findings

- SANH created a dedicated South Asia nitrogen policy database with comprehensive metadata and classifications, enabling structured analysis of nitrogen policy landscapes.
- The approach builds on the global nitrogen policy assessment by Kanter et al. (2020), expanding the dataset with a South Asia focus (SANH) and deeper dive into direct and indirect nitrogen policy relationships.
- The policy database provides insights into which sectors and environmental sinks are prioritized and what policy instruments are in use or proposed, informing future policy development and evaluation.
- Acknowledged that the 2019 policy set serves as a baseline for monitoring and comparing future policy performance in Nr management.

## Relationship to broader work
- The SANH methodology extends the Kanter et al. (2020) global study by increasing coverage in a high-priority region and improving depth of analysis (direct vs indirect nitrogen relevance, multiple sinks, and nuanced policy classifications).

## Challenges and considerations for monitoring
- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating SANH policies with other relevant data to avoid single-use datasets.
- Ensuring broad access to underlying data used to generate outputs, supporting transparency and reproducibility for policymakers and researchers.

## Notes
- The document references Table 1 (policy counts by country and data source) and Figure 1 (overview of methods), and acknowledges Kanter as a co-author of the global policy framework and the first author of the Kanter et al. (2020) paper that established the global database.
