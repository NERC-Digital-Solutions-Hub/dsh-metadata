# 1.1 Brief methods overview

- Purpose: Build the nitrogen policy arena for South Asia by collecting and analysing nitrogen-related policies to identify gaps, opportunities, and policy instruments for managing reactive nitrogen (Nr) in the region. This complements the global assessment by Kanter et al. (2020) and yields a South Asia–specific SANH policy database.

- Data sources and scope:
  - Created a SANH policy database with 966 nitrogen-relevant policies valid in 2019, collected during 2020–2021.
  - Based on an adjusted data-collection approach using multiple online sources, notably FAOLEX and ECOLEX, plus other government and ministry websites.
  - For South Asia, 55% of policies were sourced from FAOLEX and 45% from other sources.
  - Builds on Kanter et al. (2020) global dataset (which had 2,726 policies from 186 countries).
  - The SANH database focuses on policies across sectors: agriculture, land use, environment, human health, marine, urban development, water and waste management, transport, energy, and industry; identifies responsible ministries to aid searches.

- Data collected (fields recorded):
  - Policy title, year of establishment, data source (FAOLEX/ECOLEX or other), FAOLEX Rec.Id and URL (where applicable), Related File URL, policy document type, country, territorial division (national/sub-national), language, and responsible ministry.

- Collection process:
  - Sources include FAOLEX/ECOLEX and a range of government/ministry websites.
  - Policies were collected up to December 2019 (valid in 2019) and prepared in spreadsheet form for filtering and analysis.

- Filtering (how relevance was assessed):
  - Relevance guided by sector/sub-sector alignment and keywords: fertilizer, manure, nitrogen pollution, nutrient pollution, nitrate/nitrite/ammonia, N oxides, greenhouses gases, etc.
  - Clustering approach: determine central (core) policies vs subordinate, amendments, or repealed/replaced policies. Amendments with substantial new nitrogen content were kept as separate entries; minor amendments were clustered with core policies.
  - Central node vs subordinate policies and amendment status affected whether a policy was counted as an individual entry.

- Classification framework (1.2 Policy Classification; Table 2 & 3):
  - Classified by:
    - Sink: Water, Air, Climate, Soil, Ecosystem, Multiple, NA
    - Sector: Agriculture, Energy, Food, Industry, Land Use Change, Transport, Urban Development & Tourism, Waste, Other, Multiple, NA
    - Policy Type: Regulatory, Economic, Framework, Data & Methods, R&D, Commerce, Pro-nitrogen, etc.
    - Pollution Type: Point source, Non-point source, Both, Unspecified, NA
    - Impact Direction: Positive, Mixed/Neutral, Negative
    - Impact Scope: Large, Medium, Small
    - Relevance: High (direct), Medium (indirect)
  - Definitions and coding rules align with the Kanter et al. (2020) global approach, with additional classifications.
  - Keyword list used for relevance includes terms such as fertilizer, nitrogen pollution, nitrate, ammonia, nitrous oxide, eutrophication, groundwater quality, air quality, emissions, etc.

- Quality control and governance:
  - Coordinated, interdisciplinary team with Kanter (co-author) to ensure consistency with the global approach.
  - Core coordination team facilitated co-design and consistency; online biweekly meetings maintained momentum.
  - One-to-one training and discussions with partners ensured uniform capacity and confidence in analysis.
  - Country-level datasets quality-checked by coordinators and external reviewers (including Kanter) to align filtering and classification.
  - Strong reliance on the contribution of South Asia partners to identify national sources and overcome language barriers.

- Relation to the global study and outputs:
  - SANH refined and expanded the methodology to provide deeper insight into direct and indirect nitrogen policies than the global study alone.
  - The SANH dataset (966 policies) substantially expands beyond the 9% overlap with the global dataset.
  - The document references the broader context: Kanter et al. (2020) produced the first global nitrogen policy database; Kanter is the first author of that paper.

- Country-level overview (SANH 2019 total per country; percentage of SANH total):
  - Afghanistan: 89 policies (9%)
  - Bangladesh: 187 policies (19%)
  - Bhutan: 60 policies (6%)
  - India: 192 policies (20%)
  - Maldives: 40 policies (4%)
  - Nepal: 108 policies (11%)
  - Pakistan: 175 policies (18%)
  - Sri Lanka: 115 policies (12%)
  - South Asia total: 966 policies (100%)

- Key implications for policy analysis:
  - Provides a structured, searchable database of nitrogen-related policies across major sectors and government bodies.
  - Enables identification of policy gaps, central vs. subnational policy relationships, and opportunities for strengthening nitrogen management in South Asia.
  - Supports transparency and reproducibility through documentation of data sources, classifications, and quality-control processes.
