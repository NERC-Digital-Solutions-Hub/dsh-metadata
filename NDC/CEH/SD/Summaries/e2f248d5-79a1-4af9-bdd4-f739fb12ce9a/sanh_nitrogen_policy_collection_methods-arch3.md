# Nitrogen policy arena for South Asia: SANH policy database methodology

- Aim and scope
  - Build the nitrogen policy arena for South Asia by collecting and analysing nitrogen-related policies to identify gaps, opportunities, and needs for future management of reactive nitrogen (Nr).
  - Extends Kanter et al. (2020) global assessment; SANH created a South Asia policy database to support policy scrutiny, prioritisation, and decision-making.
  - Outputs describe which sectors and sinks are prioritised, and which policy instruments exist or are recommended, informing future policy design and evaluation.

- Data sources and policy corpus
  - SANH database comprises 966 nitrogen-relevant policies valid in 2019 (collected 2020–2021).
  - Country distribution (counts within 966): Afghanistan 89; Bangladesh 187; Bhutan 60; India 192; Maldives 40; Nepal 108; Pakistan 175; Sri Lanka 115.
  - Primary data sources: FAOLEX/ECOLEX (about 55%) and other web sources (about 45%).
  - Policy documents include legislation, acts, laws, ordinances, plans, strategies, regulations, standards, rules, orders, codes, frameworks, and guidelines.
  - Sectors and ministries covered: agriculture, land use, environment, human health, marine, urban development, water and waste management, transport, energy, industry; identified responsible ministries to aid searches.

- Collection and metadata
  - Descriptive metadata captured in spreadsheets: policy title, year of establishment, data source, FAOLEX Rec.Id (if applicable), record URL, related file URL, policy type, country, territorial division, language, and responsible ministry.
  - For South Asia, mix of FAOLEX (55%) and other sources (45%) used to ensure coverage.

- Filtering and relevance assessment
  - Policies filtered for relevance using sectoral/sub-sector links and keywords (e.g., fertilizer, nitrogen pollution, nutrient pollution, nitrate, ammonium, nitrogen oxides, eutrophication, etc.).
  - Clustering approach: identify core/original policies (central nodes) vs subordinate, amendments, repealed/replaced policies; minor amendments clustered to core policies unless substantial new nitrogen content is present.
  - Final set focused on policies with substantial content related to nitrogen management.

- Classification framework
  - Multi-dimensional classification to reveal patterns across countries and policy types. Classifications include:
    - Sink: water, air, climate, soil, ecosystem, multiple, or NA (no sink referenced).
    - Sector: agriculture, energy, food, industry, land use change, transport, urban development & tourism, waste, other, multiple, NA.
    - Policy type: regulatory, economic, framework, data & methods, research & development (R&D), commerce, pro-nitrogen, or multiple/NA.
    - Pollution type: point source, non-point source, both, unspecified, NA.
    - Impact direction: positive, mixed/neutral, negative.
    - Impact scope: large, medium, small.
    - Relevance to nitrogen: high (direct), medium (indirect).
  - The classification approach follows Kanter et al. (2020) with additional categories and explicit coding guidance (Tables 2 and 3 in the document).

- Data quality control and governance
  - Integrated, interdisciplinary process with a core coordination team to ensure consistency and methodological alignment.
  - Biweekly online meetings; one-to-one partner training to harmonise data collection and analysis.
  - Datasets quality-checked by coordinators and external reviewers (including Kanter) to ensure filtering and classification consistency.
  - Substantial involvement of South Asia research partners to adapt methods, overcome language barriers, and source national web content.
  - Emphasis on transparency and potential data sharing, while recognising barriers to openly sharing datasets and metadata.

- Outputs and significance
  - SANH policy database provides a transparent, country-comparable corpus of nitrogen-related policies for South Asia (966 policies, 2019).
  - Enables identification of gaps, opportunities, and needs for future nitrogen policy and management, and helps prioritise sectors and policy instruments.
  - Demonstrates a rigorous methodology for building regional monitoring datasets: from collection and metadata capture, through relevance filtering, to multi-criteria classification and quality assurance.

- Relation to broader monitoring framework goals
  - Aligns with the aim of monitoring environmental health measures to scrutinise policy and inform future decisions.
  - Highlights governance considerations: openness of underlying data, data management standards, and clear presentation of findings via reports, charts, or dashboards.
  - Acknowledges practical challenges common to monitoring frameworks, such as data gaps, access limitations, organizational silos, metadata quality, data transformation needs, and communicating complex results effectively.
