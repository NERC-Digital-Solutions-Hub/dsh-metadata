# 1.1 Brief methods overview

## Context and aims
- Part of the effort to build the nitrogen policy arena for South Asia.
- SANH collected and analyzed nitrogen-related policies to identify gaps and opportunities for managing reactive nitrogen (Nr).
- Builds on Kanter et al. (2020) global policy assessment; SANH expands coverage to South Asia with a dedicated database of 966 policies valid in 2019 (collected 2020–2021).

## Data sources and collection
- Primary data sources: FAOLEX (55% of South Asia policies) and ECOLEX plus other government/ministry websites (45%).
- Policy types collected: Legislation, Acts, Laws, Ordinances, Plans, Strategies, Regulations, Standards, Rules, Codes, Frameworks, Guidelines.
- Sectors covered: agriculture, land use, environment, human health, marine, urban development, water and waste management, transport, energy, industry.
- For each policy, data fields captured (descriptive spreadsheet): policy title, year, data source, Rec.Id (if FAOLEX), URL, Related File URL, document type, country, territorial division (national/sub-national), language, responsible ministry.

## Data product and outputs
- Created the SANH policy database with 966 nitrogen-relevant policies (2019 baseline).
- Country-level overview presented in Table 1 (policy counts by country; source breakdown by FAOLEX vs other sources).

## Filtering and relevance assessment
- Relevance filtering using keywords (e.g., fertilizer, nitrogen pollution, nutrient pollution, nitrates, ammonia, N oxides, etc.).
- Clustering approach: identify core/original policies vs subordinate policies, amendments, repeals, or replacements.
- Amendments with substantial new nitrogen content kept as separate entries; minor amendments/repeals clustered to the core policy.

## Classification framework
- Policies classified across multiple dimensions:
  - Environmental sinks: Water, Air, Climate, Soil, Ecosystem, Multiple, NA.
  - Sectors and sub-sectors: Agriculture, Energy, Food, Industry, Land Use Change, Transport, Urban Development & Tourism, Waste, Other, Multiple, NA.
  - Policy type: Regulatory, Economic, Framework, Data & Methods, R&D, Commerce, Pro-nitrogen.
  - Pollution type: Point source, Non-point source, Both, Unspecified, NA.
  - Impact direction: Positive, Mixed/Neutral, Negative.
  - Impact scope: Large, Medium, Small.
  - Relevance: High (direct), Medium (indirect), Low (indirect).
- Classifications follow Kanter et al. (2020) with additional categories; “core” policies are those most likely to impact nitrogen management.

## Quality control and governance
- Integrated, interdisciplinary quality assurance.
- Core coordination team ensured consistency; online biweekly meetings supported progress.
- One-to-one training with partners to ensure uniform capacity.
- Policy datasets quality checked by coordinators and external reviewers (including Kanter).
- National partners’ involvement and language considerations addressed to enable data collection across countries.

## Key findings and significance
- The SANH database expands global efforts by providing a South Asia–focused, comprehensive collection of nitrogen-related policies.
- The database enables assessment of which sectors, sinks, and policy instruments are prioritized, and where gaps or opportunities exist for Nr management.
- Demonstrates a robust, transparent workflow for collecting, filtering, classifying, and QA’ing policy data, enabling end-users to explore and re-use the data and analyses.

## Relationship to prior work
- Extends the global nitrogen policy approach initiated by Kanter et al. (2020), increasing regional depth (South Asia) and producing a sizable, searchable policy dataset for regional policy analysis and future policy design.
