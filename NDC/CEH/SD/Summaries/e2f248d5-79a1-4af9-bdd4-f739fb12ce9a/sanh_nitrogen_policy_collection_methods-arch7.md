# 1.1 Brief methods overview

- Objective and context: Building the nitrogen policy arena for South Asia by collecting and analysing nitrogen-related policies to identify gaps, opportunities, and needs for effective reactive nitrogen management. The SANH policy assessment builds on a global study (Kanter et al., 2020) to understand sectoral priorities, policy instruments, and potential performance indicators.
- Data scope and sources: Expanded the existing global database with South Asia-specific policies, resulting in a SANH policy database of 966 policies valid in 2019, collected during 2020–2021. Policies were sourced from FAOLEX/ECOLEX (about 55%) and additional web sources (about 45%).
- Geographic coverage: South Asia, covering Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Country-level counts in the SANH database total 966 policies (e.g., India 192, Pakistan 175, Bangladesh 187, Sri Lanka 115, Nepal 108, Afghanistan 89, Sri Lanka 115, Maldives 40, Bhutan 60).
- Data collection and fields: Descriptive information recorded in spreadsheet form, including policy title, year established, data source (FAOLEX/ECOLEX or other), if FAOLEX: Rec.Id and URL, Related File URL, policy document type (legislation, policy, regulation, etc.), country, territorial division (national/sub-national), language, and responsible ministry.
- Coverage and sectors: Sectors and sub-sectors identified to cover agriculture, land use, environment, human health, marine, urban development, water and waste management, transport, energy, industry; ministries involved include both obvious and less obvious ones (e.g., Health).
- Filtering process: Policies filtered for relevance using keywords (e.g., fertilizer, nitrogen pollution, nutrient pollution) and clustering logic. Core “central node” policies were distinguished from subordinate policies, amendments, repeals, or minor amendments (the latter clustered to the core policy if content wasn’t substantially nitrogen-related).
- Classification scheme: Policies classified by environmental sink, sector, sub-sector, policy type, pollution source type (point, non-point, both, unspecified, NA), impact direction (positive, mixed/neutral, negative), impact scope (large, medium, small), and relevance (high, medium). Classifications follow and extend Kanter et al. (2020) with additional categories.
- Data fields and coding details: Classification tables specify sinks (Water, Air, Climate, Soil, Ecosystem, Multiple, NA), sectors (e.g., Agriculture, Energy, Food, Industry, etc.), policy types (Regulatory, Economic, Framework, Data & Methods, R&D, Commerce, Pro-nitrogen), pollution types, impact directions, and impact scopes; a comprehensive key-words list is used to determine relevance.
- Quality control and governance: Integrated, interdisciplinary approach with a core coordination team and Kanter as co-author for alignment with the global study. Processes included: online biweekly meetings, one-to-one partner training, consistent data collection and analysis practices, country-level data quality checks by coordinators and external reviewers (including Kanter), and recognition of SOUTH Asia partners’ contributions to overcome language barriers and identify national sources.
- Reuse and significance: The SANH database provides a deeper, region-specific assessment of nitrogen-related policies, enabling more targeted policy synthesis and informing future nitrogen management needs in South Asia. It also demonstrates how to adapt a global methodology for regional policy datasets.
