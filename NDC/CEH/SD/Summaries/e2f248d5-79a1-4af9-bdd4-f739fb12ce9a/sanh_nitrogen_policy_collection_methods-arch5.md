# 1.1 Brief methods overview

## Overview
- The SANH (South Asia Nitrogen Hub) aimed to build a nitrogen policy arena for South Asia by collecting and analyzing nitrogen-related policies to identify gaps, opportunities, and needs for future nitrogen management.
- Builds on Kanter et al. (2020) global nitrogen policy database; SANH created a new South Asia policy database with 966 policies valid in 2019, collected during 2020–2021.

## Data sources and collection
- Data sources: FAOLEX (55% of policies) and other sources including ECOLEX and government/ministry websites.
- Scope: Policies from South Asia across sectors and ministries; included Legislation, Acts, Laws, Regulations, Plans, Strategies, Standards, Guidelines, etc.
- Data collection and recording: Descriptive information captured in spreadsheets including:
  - policy title, year, data source (FAOLEX ECOLEX vs other), FAOLEX Rec.Id (when applicable), Record ID URL, Related File URL, policy type, country, territorial division, language, and responsible ministry.

## Data fields, data model, and provenance
- Data fields: Title, year of establishment, source, identification IDs/URLs, document type, country, division (national/sub-national), language, and responsible ministry.
- Data model supports linking to source records (e.g., FAOLEX Rec.Id with direct URL) to enable traceability and access to abstracts/indexing.
- Inclusion of multiple document types and sectors to ensure broad coverage of nitrogen-related policy instruments.

## Collection, filtering, and relevance
- Filtering approach: Relevance guided by sector/sub-sector coverage and keywords (e.g., fertilizer, nitrogen pollution, nutrient pollution). 
- Clustering logic: Identified central ('core') policies (Act, Law, or strategy) and subordinate policies; amendments evaluated for substantial new nitrogen content and either kept as separate entries or clustered to the core policy.
- Outcome of filtering: A curated dataset emphasizing policies with direct or indirect relevance to nitrogen management.

## Classification framework
- Classifications aligned with a structured schema to enable cross-country comparisons and pattern analysis:
  - Sink: Water, Air, Climate, Soil, Ecosystem, Multiple, NA
  - Sector: Agriculture, Energy, Food, Industry, Land Use Change, Transport, Urban Development & Tourism, Waste, Other, Multiple, NA
  - Policy Type: Regulatory, Economic, Framework, Data & Methods, R&D, Commerce, Pro-nitrogen, etc.
  - Pollution Type: Point source, Non-point source, Both, Unspecified, NA
  - Impact Direction: Positive, Mixed/neutral, Negative
  - Impact Scope: Large, Medium, Small
  - Relevance: High (direct), Medium (indirect), Low
- Key definitions and classification rules are provided (Tables 2 and 3) to maintain consistency across analysts.

## Quality control and governance
- Coordination and process governance:
  - A core coordination team facilitated co-design and consistency; online biweekly group meetings supported momentum and shared progress.
  - One-to-one training with data collectors ensured consistency and confidence across disciplines.
- Data validation:
  - Datasets for each country were quality checked by coordinators and external reviewers (including Kanter).
  - The South Asian partners' involvement was essential for data collection, language access, and country-specific validation.
- Provenance and transparency:
  - Documentation of data sources, IDs, URLs, and country-level details to enable traceability and reuse.
- Research integration:
  - SANH work built on Kanter et al. (2020) global approach, with collaborative refinement to provide deeper assessment of nitrogen policies.

## Data maintenance, scope, and usage notes
- Coverage: 966 policies identified for South Asia, with validation against multiple sources to ensure coverage across sectors and ministries.
- Timeframe: Policies valid as of December 2019; collection conducted in 2020–2021.
- Access and reproducibility: Data fields include direct URLs and IDs (e.g., FAOLEX Rec.Id) to facilitate access to abstracts and indexing information.
- Role of collaboration: Emphasized the importance of national partners to identify local web sources and overcome language barriers, enabling broader and more accurate data capture.

## Key outcomes relevant to data stewardship
- Provides a reproducible, transparent methodology for assembling a policy database with traceable provenance, comprehensive metadata, and a robust classification scheme.
- Establishes a scalable framework for updating and maintaining policy datasets across countries and sectors, with clear QA procedures and documentation.
- Enables analysis of policy instruments and sectoral coverage to identify gaps and opportunities in nitrogen management in South Asia.
