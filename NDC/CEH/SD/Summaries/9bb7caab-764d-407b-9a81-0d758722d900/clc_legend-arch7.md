# Archetype: GIS Specialists

## Aim
- Create data products, primarily map-based, that enable their audience to understand and explore relevant information.
- Act as data analysts focusing on Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to produce map-based visualisations for policy colleagues, clients, or the public.

## Who they are
- Data analysts specialising in GIS.
- Develop map-based visualisations for diverse audiences (policy colleagues, clients, the public).

## How they meet their aims
- Work closely with end users to understand audience needs throughout the process.
- Locate and verify data appropriate for purposes.
- Quality assure, clean, and transform data; aggregate datasets from different resolutions.
- Analyse data to identify significant features and determine how to present them.
- Present data in map formats using GIS to clearly show spatial features.
- Test early prototypes and iterate based on feedback. 

## Particular Challenges
- Responding to requests that overlook data limitations rather than prioritising needs.
- Data is dispersed across many locations.
- Data gaps, especially at suitable resolutions.
- Inconsistent data standards.
- Large or complex datasets not packaged into manageable units.
- Effort required to clean and transform data.
- Building teams with sufficient GIS-related skills.
