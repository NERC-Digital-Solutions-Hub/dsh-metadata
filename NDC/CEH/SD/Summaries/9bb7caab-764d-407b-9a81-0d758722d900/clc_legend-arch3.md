# Authors of Monitoring Frameworks

## Aim
- Identify environmental health measures to scrutinise and evaluate policy, and inform future decisions.

## Who they are
- Management-level professionals within government departments or environmental quangos.
- Responsible for deciding on and implementing environmental health monitoring approaches.

## How they meet their aims
- Engage with stakeholders and experts to understand which measures provide useful insight; learn from others to avoid duplication.
- Find and verify available data; address metadata shortcomings by contacting dataset originators.
- May add metadata to datasets; often must publicly share data used, which can be a barrier.
- Commission new data to fill gaps; ensure quality, openness, and data management standards are set at the source.
- Ensure data is quality assured, cleaned, transformed, analysed; present findings clearly via reports, charts, or dashboards.
- Disseminate outputs; consult stakeholders; ensure underlying data is shared appropriately; implement data governance processes.

## Particular Challenges
- Lack of data, including data of a good enough standard.
- Lack of access to data, including issues with timeliness.
- Silos within and between organisations hindering collaboration.
- Public sharing requirements for datasets can be a barrier to using existing data.
- Concerns about keeping data up to date deter data sharing.
- Inadequate metadata hinders verification against requirements.
- Data formats often require effortful transformation to be usable.
- Difficulty in communicating complex findings clearly.
- Establishing data governance processes to ensure datasets meet standards, are stored, shared, and kept up to date.
