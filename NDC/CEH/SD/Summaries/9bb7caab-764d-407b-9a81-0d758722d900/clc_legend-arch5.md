# Data Stewards

## Aim
- Ensure datasets meet appropriate standards
- Ensure datasets are stored, shared, and kept up to date
- Datasets are readily discovered and used by others
- Work for organisations or networks with large numbers of datasets
- Ensure appropriate data governance is in place

## Who they are
- Employed by organisations or networks with large datasets
- Responsible for ensuring appropriate data governance
- Understand good data management practices
- Collaborate with data creators/sharers, informed by understanding data user needs

## How they meet their aims
- Understand user needs to ensure shared datasets meet those needs; may adopt a publishing mindset to create usable datasets
- Collaborate with data creators to ensure standards are met (accuracy, consistency, metadata, format); provide guidance and tools
- Identify data availability and limitations (disclosure risks, proprietary issues, embargoes)
- Receive data (sometimes needing to chase up)
- Quality assure, clean, and transform datasets before sharing
- Ensure that sharing limitations are respected and establish systems for updates
- Upload datasets to relevant portals and catalogue data holdings
- Document work done on datasets where appropriate

## Particular Challenges
- Incomplete picture of user needs and priorities
- Getting data in a timely manner
- Getting data creators to meet standards, including metadata
- Working with many different systems and formats, including difficult ones
- Working with large datasets that are hard to transfer
- Working with outdated databases that necessitate bespoke, non-interoperable solutions
