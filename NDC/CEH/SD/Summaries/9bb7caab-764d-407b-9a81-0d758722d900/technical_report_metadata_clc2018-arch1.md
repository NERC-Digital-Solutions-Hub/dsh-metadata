- Lineage
  - 2018 UK CLC update process
    - Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery from 2017 used for image interpretation.
    - Aerial imagery from Google Earth supported interpretation.
    - Followed EEA technical guidelines; used InterChange support package for mapping CLC changes; revised 2012 map accordingly.

- Access, use, and rights
  - Data access governed by Commission delegated regulation on GMES (Copernicus) data; free, full, and open access with attribution, no official endorsement implied, and EU ownership statements for adapted or modified data.
  - License requires informing users of data source and clear attribution; data remains EU property.

- Quality control and verification
  - Internal quality control by University of Leicester; each Working Unit independently interpreted by two people; InterCheck software used; feedback loop to interpreters to finalize units.
  - External quality control by European Technical Team (CTT) in February and June 2018; remote verifications covering representative areas and multiple interpreters; errors tracked and reported with verification reports.
