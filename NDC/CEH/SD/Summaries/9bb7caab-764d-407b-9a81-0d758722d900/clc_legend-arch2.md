# Archetype: Analysts Monitoring the Environment

## Aim
- To use data to demonstrate the condition of the environment in a consistent format that allows the scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Who they are
- Typically work for organisations with set environmental monitoring responsibilities.
- Likely possess topic expertise and analytical skills.
- Generally follow broad, standardised approaches rather than diving deeply into data beyond established norms.

## How they meet their aims
- Understand the required data (often from established sources), verify it, quality assure, clean, and transform it.
- Analyse data using standardised methods to produce outputs such as categorising environmental health against standards.
- Present findings in clear formats like reports, maps, and charts.
- Ensure created datasets are stored and uploaded to the appropriate portals.

## Outputs and practices
- Create datasets and dashboards that reflect environmental health against standards.
- Use standardized analytical workflows and documentation to enable reproducibility.
- Focus on clear communication of results to policymakers and stakeholders.

## Particular Challenges
- Increasing the value of datasets created for monitoring by combining them with other relevant data (avoiding 'single use').
- Enabling others to access the underlying data used to create final outputs.
