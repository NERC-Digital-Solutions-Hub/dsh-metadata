## Lineage and Production

- Updated for reference year 2018; main objective: detect and map land cover changes > 5 ha
- Imagery basis: Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 (2017) for image interpretation
- Support imagery: Google Earth for interpretation
- Production methodology aligned with EEA technical guidelines; used InterChange mapping for CLC changes and revising the 2012 map

## Access, Use Conditions and Licensing

- Access: Free, full, and open access with specific conditions
- Conditions include:
  - Acknowledge EU source when distributing data or service information
  - Do not imply official EU endorsement of user activities
  - Clearly state if data/information has been adapted or modified
- Legal context: Tied to EU Copernicus regulations and governance; data remains EU property with grant acknowledgment
- Data rights: Governed by Commission delegated regulation EU No 1159/13 (with successor provisions)

## Quality Control and Validation

- Internal quality control (University of Leicester): 
  - Every Working Unit (WU) interpreted independently by two people
  - InterCheck software used; feedback cycles from interpreter to improve shapefiles
- External quality control (European Technical Team, CTT): 
  - Two remote verifications in Feb 2018 and Jun 2018
  - Sample areas checked for harmonised European CLC2018
  - Errors recorded as points in shapefiles with descriptive attributes and verification reports
- Verification scope included CLC2012 revision and CLC-Changes 2012-2018 layers

## How this supports Data Use and Product Development (Data Support perspective)

- Facilitates data discovery and integration by detailing dataset scope, coverage, and CRS, enabling self-serve data products (e.g., maps and change analyses)
- Enables quality assurance workflows through documented internal/external validation processes
- Provides lineage and methods to reproduce or audit changes (2012 revision, 2012–2018 changes) and the imagery basis for interpretation
- Clarifies access constraints and attribution requirements essential for sharing, dashboards, or public communication
- Supports interoperability with EU Copernicus/INSPIRE standards for policy-oriented data use and environmental monitoring
