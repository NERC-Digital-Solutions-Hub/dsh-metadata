# Technical Report Metadata for Corine Land Cover data 2018. UK.

- Purpose and scope
  - Metadata for three UK Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets: CLC2018_UK.shp (2018 status map), CLC2012rev_UK.shp (revised 2012 map updated in 2018), and CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp (CLC changes 2012–2018).
  - UK coverage includes Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Guernsey, Jersey, and Northern Ireland.
  - Datasets contain CLC level-3 classification codes, area (ha), length, feature area, remarks, and a unique ID.

- Datasets and technical details
  - Dataset 1: Corine land cover 2018 (CLC2018_UK.shp)
    - Final UK status map for 2018
    - Projection: British National Grid; Transverse Mercator
    - Geographic CRS: GCS_OSGB_1936; Datum: D_OSGB_1936
  - Dataset 2: Corine land cover 2012 (revised) (CLC2012rev_UK.shp)
    - Updated 2012 map revised during 2018 change mapping
    - Same projection/CRS as above
  - Dataset 3: Corine land changes (2012–2018) (CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp)
    - Final UK changes layer (2012–2018) mapped directly
    - Same projection/CRS as above
  - Metadata language: English; metadata hierarchy: Dataset
  - File identifiers and international coordination: CLC_metadata_UK

- Metadata standards and access
  - Metadata aligns with the EEA Metadata Profile (INSPIRE compliant with extensions)
  - Online resource linkage provided; governance and ownership described
  - Access and licensing: use governed by European Commission/GMES provisions; open access under specific conditions; attribution and clarity on adaptation required

- Lineage and production
  - CLC UK 2018 update used Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery from 2017; aerial imagery from Google Earth supported interpretation
  - Followed EEA technical guidelines for producing CLC changes; InterChange mapping tool used
  - Revision of the 2012 map included to ensure harmonization with European CLC2018

- Spatial and thematic specifications
  - Corine 44-class nomenclature; level-3 class codes included
  - Minimum mapping units: status layers 25 ha; linear features 100 m; changes (LCC) 5 ha
  - Extent: West -8.62°, East 1.76°, South 49.88°, North 60.84°
  - Spatial resolution parameter: 1:100,000 denominator

- Quality control and verification
  - Internal quality control by University of Leicester; dual interpretation of each work unit (InterCheck)
  - External verification by European Technical Team (CTT) in two rounds (Feb and Jun 2018) sampling multiple work units
  - Errors recorded and fed back to interpreters; ongoing checks ensured harmonization with European CLC2018

- Lineage and usage restrictions
  - Lineage statement emphasizes monitoring land cover and land use changes for environmental indicators, policy support, and EU reporting (e.g., biodiversity, climate change, Water Framework Directive)
  - Acknowledges sources: Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, Google Earth imagery; adherence to EEA guidelines

- Stakeholders and contacts
  - Originator: University of Leicester
  - Custodian: Defra
  - Owner/Endorsement: European Environment Agency and European Commission DG ENTR
  - Primary topic: Environment; imagery base maps / earth cover
  - Acknowledgments for consortium: University of Leicester, Centre for Landscape and Climate Research, Specto Natura; funded by EU Copernicus Programme

- Practical implications for data leadership
  - Provides harmonized, policy-relevant UK CLC datasets aligned with European standards
  - Clear data lineage, production methods, and quality processes supporting governance, reuse, and cross-network collaboration
  - Metadata supports discoverability, interoperability, and responsible data sharing with attribution and licensing clarity
