# Centre for Landscape and Climate Research School Geography, Geology and Environment Technical Report Metadata for Corine Land Cover data 2018. UK.

## Executive overview
- Metadata report for three UK Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets: CLC2018_UK.shp, CLC2012rev_UK.shp, CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp.
- UK coverage includes Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Guernsey, Jersey, and Northern Ireland.
- Dataset attributes include CLC level-3 codes, area (hectares), length, area for each feature, remarks, and a unique ID.

## Datasets described
- Dataset 1: Corine land cover 2018 (CLC2018_UK.shp)
  - Status map for UK in 2018.
  - Projections: British National Grid; Projection: Transverse Mercator; Geographic: GCS_OSGB_1936; Datum: D_OSGB_1936.
- Dataset 2: Corine land cover 2012 (revised) for the UK (CLC2012rev_UK.shp)
  - Updated CLC2012 map for the UK, revised during 2018 change mapping.
  - Same projection and coordinate system as Dataset 1.
- Dataset 3: Corine land changes (2012-2018) for the UK (CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp)
  - Changes between 2012 and 2018 mapped directly.
  - Same projection and coordinate system as above.

## Metadata and standard compliance
- Metadata language: English; hierarchy level: Dataset.
- Metadata conformant with the EEA Metadata Profile (INSPIRE compliant with some extensions).
- Online metadata resource: linked via Eionet/Gb Copernicus portal.
- Point of contact: University of Leicester (Originator), Defra (Custodian), European Environment Agency (Owner/Co-ordinator), European Commission DG ENTR (Owner).

## Content and parameters
- Purpose: provide UK component of Copernicus CORINE land cover datasets; supports land cover inventory, change detection, environmental indicators, and policy monitoring.
- Base parameters: 44-class Corine nomenclature; MMU 25 ha for status layers; MMU 5 ha for change layers.
- Data are designed for integration into seamless European land cover maps; applicable to policy monitoring and environmental reporting.

## Lineage and production notes
- 2018 UK CLC update targeted land cover changes >5 ha; base imagery from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 (2017); Google Earth imagery used for interpretation support.
- Production followed EEA technical guidelines; used InterChange mapping tools; revised the 2012 map where appropriate.

## Quality control and validation
- Internal QC: University of Leicester; each Working Unit interpreted by two different interpreters; InterCheck software used; feedback loops ensured corrections prior to completion.
- External QC: European Technical Team (CTT) conducted two remote verifications (Feb 2018 and Jun 2018) for harmonisation across Europe; included detailed error reporting and verification of multiple interpreters’ outputs.
