# Archetype: Data Leaders

## Overview
- Hold management roles focused on implementing an effective data strategy.
- Apply past data analysis knowledge to the organisational data function.
- Consider data as part of a wider community, potentially collaborating across networks of partners.

## How Data Leaders Meet Their Aims
- Think about the whole data system and its end-to-end lifecycle.
- Understand user needs (e.g., policy colleagues) as an ongoing process and support co-ownership of data products.
- Know what data is available and where gaps exist; verify data suitability to prioritise work.
- Source data through platforms, online searches, and outreach; commission new data and creatively gather data.
- Promote good analytical, presentation, and dissemination practices within their teams.
- Ensure data assets are well-managed (format, quality, metadata, discoverability, updates).
- Ensure products meet user needs through feedback and iteration.
- Collaborate with the wider data community to strengthen the overall data system.

## Core Practices and Capabilities
- Map and understand the data landscape, including data availability and gaps.
- Verify data content and format quickly and effectively.
- Establish and maintain data standards, quality, and metadata for discoverability.
- Manage data assets end-to-end (format, quality, metadata, updates).
- Foster user-centred data product development with iterative feedback.
- Commission or source new data as needed; think creatively about data gathering.
- Promote strong analytical, presentation, and dissemination practices within the team.
- Engage in cross-organisational and sector-level collaboration to support an effective data ecosystem.

## Challenges
- Understanding diverse user needs across public audiences.
- Gaining an overview of scattered and fragmented data sources.
- Limited data availability, especially at required granularity.
- Barriers to access such as paywalls and data protection constraints.
- Difficulty quickly verifying data content and format.
- Lack of data standards, variable data quality, and unclear metadata.
- Sector coordination gaps, duplicated efforts, and a need for stronger communities of practice.
