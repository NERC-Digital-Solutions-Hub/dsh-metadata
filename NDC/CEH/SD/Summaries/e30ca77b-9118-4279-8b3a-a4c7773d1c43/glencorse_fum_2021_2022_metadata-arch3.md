# Ammonia enhancement data from Glencorse experimental site near UKCEH, Edinburgh (2021-2022)

- Purpose and context
  - Studies the effects of high ambient ammonia (NH3) on forest vegetation, bryophytes, lichens, and soils.
  - Conducted at the Glencorse woodland near Edinburgh (Birch plantation) from 2021 to 2022; data extend to 5 January 2023.

- Experimental design and control
  - NH3 enhancement system controlled by wind conditions; NH3 released only when wind direction is 275–345 degrees and wind speeds meet thresholds (0.3–10 m/s).
  - Release mechanism: three 20 m long PVC tubes arranged parallel; NH3 delivered from a cylinder through a mass flow controller and solenoid valve into a central manifold, then dispersed via holes along the tubes.
  - Positive pressure airflow generated by a central fan; NH3 dilution occurs in the airflow before release.
  - Wind and release conditions monitored to ensure controlled NH3 exposure.

- Measurements and instrumentation
  - Key data collected: NH3_release status (ON/OFF), NH3_flow_set (setpoint for NH3 flow), NH3_flow (actual NH3 flow), wind_speed (below-canopy), wind_direction (below-canopy).
  - Measurement interval: 15-minute averages; data timestamped in GMT.
  - Supporting instrumentation: WXT536 weather station (wind data) and a mass flow controller (MFC) for NH3 delivery.
  - Location and timing: site coordinates provided; data spanning 16 Sep 2021 to 5 Jan 2023.

- Data structure and content
  - Data volume: 45,538 measurements across 5 parameters.
  - Data format: CSV file with detailed column metadata (timestamps and descriptive attributes for each field), including instrument and manufacturer information for traceability.
  - Columns include: Timestamp; NH3_status; NH3_flow_set; NH3_flow; Wind_speed; Wind_direction; plus descriptive metadata per field.

- Quality control and data limitations
  - Visual quality checks performed; obvious instrument/logger errors and power issues removed.
  - Some gaps occurred due to the replacement of faulty gas control components.
  - Data are provided with contextual notes on release conditions and measurement units to aid interpretation.

- Data governance, sharing, and provenance
  - Data are accompanied by detailed metadata describing instruments and measurement descriptions to support verification and reuse.
  - The dataset is linked to published methodology and findings (Deshpande et al., 2024) and contributes to estimating ammonia deposition to forest ecosystems in Scotland and Sri Lanka.
  - Funding for the facility came from UKRI GCRF South Asian Nitrogen Hub.
