# Supporting information for MongooseMortalities.csv dataset

## Aim
- To estimate the proportion of mortalities from winning groups versus losing groups in intergroup conflicts among banded mongooses.

## Data structure
- Focal and rival groups are assigned randomly.
- Each record corresponds to an observed lethal intergroup encounter.
- Provides: which group won (based on which group ran away), which individual died, whether the deceased belonged to the winning or losing group, and the date.

## Data collection
- Fights observed ad libitum (as they occurred).

## Measurements and identification
- Winning group: determined by which group ran from the fight location.
- Deceased individual: identified by unique shaving patterns on the mongoose’s back; patterns reapplied monthly when animals are trapped.

## Quality control
- Field manager Francis routinely checks data before submission to the University of Exeter to ensure accuracy.

## Location and dates
- Location: Mweya, Uganda; latitude -0.191724, longitude 29.895988.
- Time span: 19/02/2000 to 11/11/2011.

## Data columns (headers) and description
- focal.group: randomly chosen focal group ID.
- rival.group: randomly chosen rival group ID.
- winner.group: ID of the winning group (as determined by the fight outcome).
- dead.individual: ID of the deceased individual.
- dead.ind.pack: which group the deceased individual belonged to.
- dead.ind.in.which.pack: whether the deceased belonged to the winning or losing group.
- date: date of the fight that led to the mortality.

## Experimental design / fieldwork notes
