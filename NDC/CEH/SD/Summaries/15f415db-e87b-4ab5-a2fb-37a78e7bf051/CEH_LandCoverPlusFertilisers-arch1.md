# CEH Land Cover plus: Fertilisers 2010-2015 (England)

- Overview
  - A set of 1 km x 1 km resolution maps showing predicted average annual application rates (2010-2015) of three inorganic fertilisers (nitrogen N, phosphorus P, potassium K) in England, with associated uncertainty.
  - Data modelled from Defra’s British Survey of Fertiliser Practice (BSFP) and interpolated on a national crop map to support analysis of agrochemical impacts on the environment.
  - Intended to aid farmers and policymakers in exploring sustainable agricultural practices and related environmental outcomes.

- Data content
  - Two raster bands per fertiliser: 
    - Band 1: Predicted average annual application rate (kg/km^2)
    - Band 2: Uncertainty (percent)
  - Separate rasters exist for N, P, and K, covering England.
  - Uncertainty reflects 95.5% confidence (two standard deviations) and is derived from kriging variance.
  - Outputs include both predicted surfaces and corresponding uncertainty surfaces for each fertiliser.

- Data sources and collection
  - Raw data from Defra’s BSFP (2010-2015): yearly, georeferenced farm records of fertiliser application (kg/ha), with crop typology (66 classes), soil type, farm size, and IDs.
  - Participation is voluntary; each year ~3,696 farms nationally representative via stratified random sampling.
  - Zeros in the BSFP data were excluded from analysis due to ambiguity (missing data, actual zero application, or substitution with organic manures); mapped surfaces represent non-zero application patterns only.

- Analytical methods
  - Interpolation using Ordinary Kriging (OK) with a supporting crop map (CEH Land Cover plus: Crops, based on Sentinel data) to tie fertiliser rates to crop areas.
  - Crops map used a 2015-2017 average, at 1 km resolution, to scale application rates by crop area per cell.
  - OK parameters: variable search radius (12 input points) and default ArcGIS settings; selection justified by performance and feasibility.
  - Outputs: prediction maps (kg/km^2) and corresponding kriging variance used to compute uncertainty.

- Data quality and uncertainty
  - Uncertainty maps generated by aggregating crop-specific variances to a total per-fertiliser surface; expressed as a percentage per grid cell.
  - Uncertainty calculation: U = (2 * sqrt(V)) / P * 100, where V is variance and P is predicted value; reflects 95.5% confidence limits.
  - Acknowledges limitations around non-spatial predictability for zero-record cells and potential correlations between crops when summing variances.

- Data structure and access
  - File format: two-band TIFF rasters for each fertiliser, covering England.
  - Filenames (examples): fertiliser_n_prediction_uncertainty, fertiliser_p_prediction_uncertainty, fertiliser_k_prediction_uncertainty.
  - Bands:
    - Band 1: Predicted average annual fertiliser application rates (kg/km^2)
    - Band 2: Uncertainty estimates (%)

- Uses and applications
  - Modelling nutrient fate and potential impacts of farming practice changes (intensification/extensification) on nutrient runoff to water.
  - Estimating greenhouse gas emissions related to fertiliser use in crops and grassland (linked to air quality).
  - Quantifying past/future impacts on eutrophication and agricultural ecosystems (e.g., arable plants, farmland birds, pollinators).
  - Linking crop growth models to identify regions where improved nutrient management could boost yields.
  - Informing policy measures to mitigate fertiliser-related environmental impacts (e.g., catchment-sensitive farming, water quality improvements).
