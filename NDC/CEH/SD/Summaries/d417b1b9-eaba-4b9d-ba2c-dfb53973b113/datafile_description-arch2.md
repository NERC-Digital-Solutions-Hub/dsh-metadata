# Aquatic carbon isotope composition in natural and restoration pools in blanket peatlands in Scotland and Northern Ireland, 2014-2015

## Aim and scope
- Describes the sample collection and analysis required to generate isotopic data for the data repository file Pools14Cdata.csv.
- Focuses on aquatic carbon isotopes (radiocarbon 14C and stable carbon δ13C) across natural and restoration peatland pools in the UK.

## Study sites and sampling design
- Regions: northern and southwest Scotland and Northern Ireland.
- Site groups:
  - Cross Lochs, Loch Lier, Munsary (Flow Country, northern Scotland)
  - Silver Flowe (blanket peatland, Galloway, southwest Scotland)
  - Slieveanorra (upland raised bog, County Antrim, NI)
  - Garron Plateau (near-natural upland blanket bog, NI)
- Pool types:
  - Natural pools sampled at all locations
  - Restoration pools (drain-blocked and rewetted) sampled at Cross Lochs and Loch Lier
- Ditching dates: 1970s (Cross Lochs and Loch Lier); rewetting restoration at Loch Lier (1998) and Cross Lochs (2002)
- Sampling campaigns:
  - Cross Lochs: May 2014, Nov 2014, Sept 2015 (P01, P04, P06, P07, P09, P10; plus P03, P05, P11, P12)
  - Loch Lier: Nov 2014; Sept 2015 sampling at all locations except Loch Lier

## Sample collection methods
- Water samples: focus on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved CO2; additional dissolved POC, ebullition CH4, ebullition CO2, dissolved CH4; pool sediment samples where possible.
- Collection and storage:
  - Water in 1 L glass bottles pre-fired at 450°C for 3 h
  - Coolers during transport, store at 4°C
  - Transport to NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride) in coolers (≤1 day)
- Filtration and carbon forms:
  - Filter water within 3 days using pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 μm)
  - POC by combusting GF/F filters when material allows
  - CO2 obtained by degassing 3 L water into a 1 L headspace; headspace gas captured on molecular sieve cartridges
- Ebullition sampling:
  - Bubble traps (inverted glass funnels with floats) deployed on 21 May 2014; checked until 5 Nov 2014
  - Gas from traps collected in N2-flushed bags; CO2 separated from CH4 in lab using molecular sieves
  - 6 natural and 5 restoration pools yielded sufficient ebullition samples for 14C analysis (four natural, two restoration for CH4; one natural for CO2)
- Sediment sampling:
  - Top ~20 cm of pool floor sediment collected with a simple corer; refrigerated at 4°C

## Sample processing and isotope analysis
- Processing at NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride)
- DOC and POC:
  - Filtered DOC solids and POC filters acid fumigated to remove inorganic C; combusted to CO2
  - Dissolved CO2 recovered from molecular sieve cartridges by heating
- Ebullition samples:
  - Filter CO2, oxidize CH4 to CO2 using platinum bead catalyst (950°C)
- Sediments:
  - Cold acid wash (1 M HCl) to remove carbonates; homogenised, freeze-dried, combusted to CO2 (sealed quartz tube method)
- General lab practices:
  - Glassware cleaned by furnace at 450°C for ≥3 h
  - CO2 graphitised via Fe-Zn reduction for all 14C samples
  - δ13C analysis (where >1 mL CO2 available) using dual-inlet IRMS; report δ13C vs VPDB (±0.1‰)
- Radiocarbon measurements:
  - 14C analysed by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS)
  - 14C content normalised to δ13C = -25‰ and expressed as F14C (±1σ)
  - Conventional radiocarbon ages provided for samples with F14C < 1
- Standards and QA:
  - Radiocarbon-dead and known-age standards processed concurrently to assess background and accuracy
  - Background correction using Dead standards (Donahue et al., 1990)
  - Reference standards: barley mash from TIRI intercomparison and 96H humin standard
- Publication and data codes:
  - Publication code and material/sample IDs track analyses
  - Site, pool type, sampling date and location details recorded
  - Uncertainties (1σ) provided for F14C and yBP

## Data product and structure

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides a standardised, traceable dataset for aquatic carbon cycling in peatland pools, including restoration sites.
- Enables temporal and spatial comparisons of carbon forms (DOC, POC, CO2, CH4) and isotopic signatures across natural and restored systems.
- Supports assessment of restoration impact on carbon pathways and long-term environmental health in blanket peatlands.
