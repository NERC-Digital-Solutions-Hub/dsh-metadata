# Long-term multisite Scots pine trial, Scotland: temperatures and temperature variances for tree nurseries, 2007-2012

## Objective
- Study to assess the impact of temperature on growth and development of Scots pine seedlings across three nurseries in Scotland from 2007 to 2012.

## Source material
- Seed source: from 21 native Scottish Scots pine populations (10 trees per population; 210 families; 24 half-sib progeny per family).
- Seed origin represents the species’ native range in Scotland, including three populations from each of seven seed zones.
- Germination and initial growing conditions conducted at the James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen.

## Experimental design
- Seedlings allocated to three nurseries, with 8 seedlings per family per nursery (total 1,680 seedlings per nursery; 1,680 × 3 = 5,040 individuals).
  - NW: outdoors at Inverewe Gardens (western Scotland).
  - NE: outdoors in a fruit cage at the James Hutton Institute (Aberdeen, eastern Scotland).
  - NG: unheated glasshouse at the James Hutton Institute (Aberdeen).
- Trees arranged in 40 randomised trays (blocks) per nursery; each block contains two trees per population (total 42 trees per block).
- 2010 changes:
  - NG plants moved outdoors to Glensaugh, Aberdeenshire.
  - All plants repotted into 19 cm (3 L) pots with Levingtons CNSE Ericaceous compost and Osmocote fertiliser; rearranged into new blocks.

## Temperature data collection and processing
- Temperature recording: hourly measurements at each nursery from Sept 2007 (NG and NE) or Nov 2007 (NW) to Mar 2012.
- Data loggers placed 50 cm above ground under an aluminium foil-covered funnel.
- Calculated daily statistics for each site:
  - DailyMaximum, DailyMinimum, DailyAverage, DailyVariance (0:00–23:00).
  - DaytimeVariance and NighttimeVariance (based on sunrise/sunset times; times obtained from timeanddate.com using site coordinates).
- Handling of missing data: days with more than one missing hourly record were excluded from daily calculations.
- Data file: NurseryTemperature.txt with fields including Nursery (NE, NG, NW), Year (2007–2010), Month (1–12), Day (1–31), Date (DD/MM/YYYY), DailyMaximum, DailyMinimum, DailyAverage, DailyVariance, DaytimeVariance, NighttimeVariance (all in appropriate units).

## Data quality and availability
- Data prepared using standardized procedures for recording and summarising environmental measurements.
- Missing data are excluded from daily statistics to maintain data integrity.
- Data are structured for cross-site comparison of temperature regimes and variance, facilitating analyses of temperature effects on seedling performance.

## Data content and usage
- Primary dataset captures long-term temperature regimes and diurnal/overall variances across three distinct nursery environments.
- Enables evaluation of how temperature and its variability correlate with seedling growth and development across different microclimates and cultural conditions (outdoors vs. glasshouse).
