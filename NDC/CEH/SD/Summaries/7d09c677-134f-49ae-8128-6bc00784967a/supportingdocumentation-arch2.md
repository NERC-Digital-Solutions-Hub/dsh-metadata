# Brief Overview

- Purpose and context
  - Repeat electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) measurements at four sites to monitor soil resistivity changes through the agricultural growing season (Spring, Summer, Autumn 2021) and relate them to crop stages and land management cycles.
  - Data collected to support the Land Management in Lowland Catchments for Integrated Flood Risk Reduction (LANDWISE) NFM research project.

- Study design and timeline
  - Seasonal campaigns: Spring (April/May), Summer (June/July), Autumn (September 2021).
  - Four sites with repeated transects to capture construction, production, and post-harvest soil conditions.
  - Precise repeat positioning using GNSS (~0.01 m accuracy) to ensure survey comparability across campaigns.

- Field methodology and instrumentation
  - 19 m ERT transects with 96 electrodes spaced 20 cm apart (Campus Tigre system).
  - Data collection in a Wenner Array configuration to achieve good vertical and horizontal resolution; each traverse yields about 660 apparent resistivity readings down to ~1 m below ground level.
  - Field data collected with ImagerPro2006; inversion and processing performed in Geotomo Res2DInv.

- Sites and transect specifics
  - Lower Hampen Farm – Barn Ground
  - Lower Hampen Farm – Flat Ground
  - Manor Farm – Whittington Hill
  - Hendred Farm – Lockinge (Untraffic) and East Hendred (Traffic A/B)
  - Start and end coordinates provided for each transect (geospatially documented).

- Data collection and processing details
  - Data scope: approximately 660 data points per 19 m transect; measurements recorded as Apparent Resistivity (Ohm·m) with a-d spacing related depth of investigation.
  - Processing: data quality checks for electrode contact, removal of noisy points before inversion in Res2DInv.
  - Data structure: stored in Geotomo Res2DInv format (example file BarnGround_April.dat), including electrode spacing, array type, number of data points, mid-point locations, and data points for each reading.

- Interpretation of measurements
  - Resistivity reflects soil structure, pore water content, and salinity; increasing spacing correlates to deeper investigation depth in the cross-section.
  - The Wenner Array configuration enables cross-sectional resistivity profiles to track changes over time related to soil physical properties and moisture dynamics.

- Outputs and data management
  - Generated resistivity profiles and cross-sections to assess temporal changes across growing seasons.
  - Data organized for archiving and sharing within the LANDWISE project framework; supports standardized monitoring outputs and potential integration with other environmental datasets.

- Key challenges and opportunities (aligned to monitoring archetype)
  - Challenge: Increasing the value of the ERT datasets by integrating with additional relevant data (e.g., soil moisture, turf/land management records) beyond single-use analyses.
  - Challenge: Enabling broader access to underlying data to support reuse and cross-project analyses.
  - Opportunity: Link resistivity changes to specific agricultural practices and hydrological processes to enhance environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessments over time.
