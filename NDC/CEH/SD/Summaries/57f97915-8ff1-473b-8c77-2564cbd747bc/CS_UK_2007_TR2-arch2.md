# CS Technical Report No.2/07 Vegetation Plots Handbook

- A comprehensive protocol for recording, locating, and re-sampling vegetation plots to create a long-term, repeatable dataset on plant presence and abundance.
- Emphasises digitally captured data (Vegplots) linked to GIS plots in ArcMap, photo documentation, and standardized species recording to enable temporal analysis of vegetation change over decades.

## Purpose and Scope
- Document the procedures to repeatably locate and record vegetation plots across various habitat types to document changes over time.
- Support large-scale, fine-grained change assessments at multiple plot sizes and configurations.
- Provide standardized data formats and workflows for data entry, quality assurance, and storage.

## Data, Tools, and Workflow Overview
- Data capture primarily via Vegplots software on tablets, with ArcMap GIS maps and digital plot photos.
- Key outputs include header data (plot meta), listed species, selected species with estimated cover, and completion/validation status.
- Data are organized by square and plot type, with unique plot IDs and nested plot structures (e.g., nest 0, nest 1, etc.).
- Photos and maps accompany every plot to aid relocation and interpretation; plots and maps are stored in tablet directories and archive folders.

## Plot Relocation and Plot Management
- Relocation: Use ArcMap plot maps and photos to relocate plots; precise GPS may be available but relocation relies on landmarks and previous marks. If relocation fails, mark as Not Found and consider creating a new plot.
- Adding new plots: Triggered when a plot cannot be found, land use changes require new plots, or new plot types are needed (e.g., M, Y, etc.).
- Plot maps: New maps should be precise, may include multiple plots per map, and edited/redrawn maps must be clearly documented.
- Plot movement: Plots can be moved in ArcMap if landscape features change, but GPS positions should not be altered to reflect relocation errors.

## GPS and Location Logging
- Historical GPS data (including non-differential GPS) may be present; contemporary practice logs GPS coordinates directly on ArcMap during recording.
- Tablet GPS is used as an aid in conjunction with maps and photos to improve repeatability.

## Data Entry and VegPlots Workflow
- Locate the point for the plot in ArcMap, then open VegPlots to enter standard recording data.
- Header information includes plot location, plot type, plot number, and status (Found, Not Found, New, Not Appropriate, etc.).
- Validation is required before exiting a plot; save frequently to avoid data loss.
- Photos of plot locations are required to facilitate future relocation; photos must include plot number/type and be repeatable.

## Plot Header and Description Details
- Plot relocation status, plate presence, and plot IDs are recorded in the Header.
- Plot description includes slope, aspect, shade, and whether photos were taken; maps are marked and kept for each plot.
- Vegetation height is captured as modal height across canopy, shrubs, and ground layers.

## Vegetation Height and Admin
- Height categories for canopy, shrubs, and ground vegetation are defined (e.g., None, 3-5 m, etc. for canopy; height bands for shrubs; ground height bands).
- Admin fields capture surveyor initials and plot completion status, including validation errors.

## Listed and Selected Species
- Listed species: All vascular plants plus a restricted set of bryophytes/lichens; encourage inclusion of unidentified species (A-C for common tab, D-Z for unidentified tab) for later identification.
- Selected species: As species are identified, they are added to a growing nest-specific list with cover estimates (in 1% increments, converted to 5% bands for final entries). Nested plots require entering cover per nest, with total cover calculated across the 200 m2 X plots.

## Plot Types (Overview of Protocols)
- X PLOTS (Large, Wally plots) – 200 m2, multiple nested plots (nest 0 to nest 4) within a 14.14 m square; used to sample common vegetation types across the landscape.
  - Locating new X plots via random points; mark with metal plate near the south corner; if needed, adjust on boundary lines.
  - Nested 1 m2 inner plots (nest 0) and subsequent nests for comprehensive species recording.
- Y PLOTS – Small (2 m x 2 m) habitat plots; focus on habitat patches or Priority Habitats not well-sampled by X plots.
  - Up to 5 plots per square; placement across PH patches determined after mapping.
- U PLOTS – Unenclosed plots (2 m x 2 m); represent unenclosed Broad Habitats.
  - Allocation based on proportion of unenclosed habitat in the square; up to 10 plots; random allocation across habitats, with minimum representation.
- S/PLOTS and W PLOTS – Streamside and waterside plots (10 m x 1 m).
  - Located along watercourses near X plots; focus on water-related vegetation; must avoid placement within 10 m of each other on the same feature.
- R/V PLOTS – Roadside and Verge plots (10 m x 1 m).
  - Located along roadsides/verges; placement starts at the interface between soil and road edge; verges must be at least 1 m wide.
- A PLOTS – Arable Field Margin plots (100 m x 1 m) adjoining boundary plots; margins can be multiple types (e.g., perennial grass margins, wildflower mixes).
  - Up to 5 A plots per square; placement from hedge/field boundary and along outward margin for consistent sampling.
- M PLOTS – Margin plots (2 m x 2 m) associated with arable fields and margins beyond cross-compliance strips; margins can be up to 6 m wide.
  - Placement to capture margin vegetation away from edges; multiple margins may exist.
- H PLOTS – Hedgerow plots (10 m x 1 m); located along hedges, with plots extending into the field from the hedge center.
- D PLOTS – Hedgerow diversity plots (30 m long, sampling across woody features); assess canopy height, gappiness, woody diversity, and invasion indicators.
- B PLOTS – Boundary plots (1 m width along field boundary) used to measure vegetation at boundaries adjacent to hedges, ditches, walls, fences, etc.
- A PLOT/HEDGE DIVERSITY specifics – Additional header fields capture distance from boundary features and boundary types.

## Data Standardization and Quality
- Aggregations and combinations: Where species are difficult to separate, amalgamated taxa are used (e.g., Cardamine hirsuta/flexuosa) to maintain consistency with legacy data.
- Bryophytes and lichens: Recorded only if present with specific presence/cover data; other bryophytes/lichens excluded.
- Nested plots and cover: Presence/absence and 5% cover bands used across nested plots; total cover summed with attention to layering (no double-counting overlapping canopies).
- Plot maps and photos: Essential for relocation accuracy; edited or redrawn maps must be documented with initials and date.

## Accessibility and Sharing Considerations (Challenges for Analysts)
- Value and reuse of datasets: Encourages linking plot data with other environmental data to increase dataset value beyond single-use outputs.
- Data access: Emphasizes making underlying data accessible to others to enable broader analysis and policy evaluation.
- Standardized formats: VegPlots and ArcMap integration supports consistent, time-series analysis across squares and years.

## Endnotes and Documentation

## How This Supports Environment Monitoring Analysts
- Provides a rigorous, repeatable framework for collecting long-term vegetation data that can be used to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Delivers standardized data capture, storage, and retrieval workflows suitable for cross-site comparisons and temporal analyses.
- Enables integration with GIS and photo documentation to enhance traceability, relocation accuracy, and data quality, aligning with aims of making environmental data broadly usable and comparable.
