# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The document outlines the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007, describing its development as part of the ITE Land Classification series (started in 1978).
- It emphasizes that the current methodology is built on and inseparable from previous approaches, and that understanding historical context is essential for interpreting time-series data.

## Purpose and core concepts

- Purpose: to provide a stratified, representative sampling framework for GB countryside surveys and to support national, regional, and country-specific environmental estimates.
- Core concepts:
  - Stratified, random sampling to minimize bias and capture variability across land types.
  - ITE Land Classification used to define strata; land classes are environmental, physiographic, and climatic groupings.
  - Sampling units: 1 km2 squares, with central squares classified and surrounding squares assigned to the same or neighboring classes.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used in early development to classify landscapes.
  - National estimates derived by combining class-level statistics with land-class areas.

## Evolution of the sampling framework and Land Classification

- 1978 (Initial CS): 256 field squares surveyed (8 per class) across 32 Land Classes. National habitat estimates calculated as mean habitat area per square within each class multiplied by the class area.
- 1984 (2nd Field Survey): sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey): Land Classification revised to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; added data on land use and habitat mapping; first link to the Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1990 Land Classification developments: expanded to classify every GB square using surrogates for climate, geology, and physiography; this introduced mismatches with the original 1228-square classification, causing some distortion in class representations.
- 2000 (CS2000): addressed policy needs for separate England & Wales vs Scotland reporting. Implemented country-unit versions of Land Classes, subdividing classes and aggregating rump classes as needed (creating 40 strata). Added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation; included an uplands module to improve upland habitat estimates.
- 2007 (CS2007): responded to devolution with Wales-only reporting needs. Implemented Welsh-specific class subdivisions (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), increasing strata to 45. Allocated 43 additional Welsh squares; adjusted English class representation accordingly (some English classes reduced to 4 squares). Wales became the most intensively sampled country unit; England and Scotland maintained substantial sampling as well.

## Country-specific reporting and upland module

- Separate country estimates: CS2000 introduced England & Wales vs Scotland reporting, requiring country-unit classifications and adjusted sampling design (sub-dividing and aggregating Land Classes, increasing strata to 40, then to 45 with Wales).
- Uplands module (CS2000): added 30 squares in uplands and marginal uplands to improve habitat estimates in these areas, ensuring better statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Practical outputs and considerations

- Outputs include spatial maps and tables showing the distribution of sampled squares by Land Class and country unit, enabling national and country-specific estimates for habitat features.
- Note on national estimates: changing the underlying Land Classification affects the consistency of stock estimates; a balance is needed between using the latest country-specific classifications and maintaining cross-survey comparability.
- Data governance: emphasis on documenting data sources and ensuring traceability of estimates across survey years.

## Appendix: brief history of the ITE Land Classification

- 1978: ISA-based 32 Land Classes from 1 km squares; central square plus surrounding squares classified; initial sampling framework established.
- 1984: expansion to 40 Land Classes and larger sample sizes; shift toward land-use features.
- 1990: all GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; introduction of land-cover mapping; classification adapted to cover all squares with some neighborhood adjustments.
- 1998–2000: refinement for Scotland and England/Wales reporting; 40 then 40–45 classes; separate country reporting introduced.
- 2007: Wales-specific classifications added (5 new Welsh classes), overall 45 strata; Wales receives more intensive sampling to support country-specific reporting.
