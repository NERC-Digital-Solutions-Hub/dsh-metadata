# Quality Assurance of botanical recording in the Countryside 2007 Survey

- Purpose: Assess the consistency and reliability of botanical recording across the Countryside 2007 Survey field program, comparing CS surveyors with QA assessors to understand data quality and implications for vegetation change assessments.
- Scope: QA on 266 plots across eight plot types in 44 squares; dedicated to measuring plot relocation, species richness, species-frequency accuracy, and species cover; comparison with QA exercises from 1990 and 1998.

## Methods and calibration

- Sampling design: 44 1-km squares; within each, one quarter surveyed for QA; targeted to include as many plot types as possible (CS2007), with triplets/couplets from past QA where possible.
- Plot types: 200 m² X plots, 4 m² Y plots, 2 m² U plots, and linear plots R (roads), H (hedges), S (streamsides), B (boundaries), A (arable).
- Recording protocol: Standardised botanical lists with vascular plants and lichens/cryptogams; 5% cover bands; initial blind recording followed by QA comparison; additional test of tablet-based data entry versus paper records.
- Relocation methods: Combination of sketch maps, surveyor photos, and metal-detecting plates to relocate plots; assessors tracked both plot and plate relocation efficiency.

## Key findings

- Plot and plate relocation
  - Plot relocation success: CS surveyors precisely relocated about 70% of plots; about 16% were adequately positioned; overall satisfactory relocation around 86% (similar to 1990/1998 QA). Unsatisfactory relocations ~14%.
  - Plate relocation: Surveyors located plates ~36.4% of the time; QA assessors re-found plates at about 67–70% when adjusted for new Wales plots; overall plate detection improved when considering all years, but the direct CS2007 figure was lower than earlier years.
  - Effective relocation reliance: Photographs and sketch maps crucial for locating plots after many years.
- Species richness
  - CS surveyors recorded an average of 17.49 species/plot vs QA assessors 21.67 species/plot; overall CS surveyed about 80.7% of QA richness.
  - Under-recording varied by plot type; Hedge and Arable plots showed higher relative agreement (94% and 96%), while other plots were around 74–79%.
  - Group differences: Forbs – ~90% captured; Grasses – ~85%; Woody species and bryophytes/cryptogams notably poorer (cryptogams especially problematic in uplands).
- Accuracy of species records
  - Total species records: CS2007 + QA2007 = 6511; common to both T1 and T2 = 3745; mis-matches = 2766 (about 34.4% of total, i.e., 65.6% crude agreement).
  - Major error sources (CS surveyors vs QA):
    - Overlooked species: 48.9%
    - Plot location/orientation errors: 14.5%
    - Species mis-identifications: 7.8%
    - Management/seasonal changes and other T2 errors accounted for remaining portions.
  - Temporal/seasonal effects: Some mis-matches due to plot management or seasonal variation; location errors increased with cryptogam emphasis and upland plotting.
  - Overall trend: Agreement in 2007 lower than 1998 and 1990 QA exercises; similar range of plot-by-plot variation to earlier QA programs but with more pronounced upland cryptogam issues.
- Species frequency and abundance
  - Frequency of occurrence: Several common species more frequently recorded by QA assessors; notable under-recording of grasses and bryophytes by CS surveyors; some species over-recorded by CS surveyors (e.g., Poa trivialis, Anisantha sterilis).
  - Cover estimates: CS surveyors tended to overestimate mean covers for many species; notable excess for Poa trivialis, Agrostis stolonifera, Dactylis glomerata, and several grasses; differences varied by species.
  - Tablet effects: Tablet test showed about 2% of entries contained errors; about 0.81% missing species codes, 0.24% wrong codes, 0.26% extra codes, 0.86% wrong cover; overall tablet-related errors ~2.29% of records.
- Cryptogams and landscapes
  - Cryptogams (mosses, liverworts, lichens) recording was particularly inconsistent, driving lower richness and accuracy in upland squares.
  - Landscape-level results: All plots combined – ~57.3% crude %Agreement and ~62.2% %Accuracy; excluding cryptogams raised agreement to ~66.8% and accuracy to ~66.4% in uplands.
  - Plot-type performance: X and B plots around 55–60% agreement; R plots around 60% agreement; U plots lowest (around 60–68% depending on metric); Arable (A) plots very variable due to seedlings and identification challenges.

## Data quality implications

- Data quality limits detection of vegetation change: Between-year comparisons show declines in CS surveyor richness (1990→1998→2007) but QA assessments do not consistently show overall declines; temporal comparisons are sensitive to who records the data and the presence of cryptogams.
- Uncertainty comes from multiple sources: plot relocation, species identification, seasonal/management changes, and increasingly, cryptogams in uplands; data from tablets introduce additional error channels but can be mitigated with better input aids.
- Robustness of trend detection depends on covering consistent, high-quality species lists and accurately recording cover, particularly for grasses and cryptogams that influenced community assessments.

## Recommendations

- No new plates unless necessary: Avoid erecting new plots/plates when the original is still present; record best estimates if a plot cannot be found.
- Enhance cryptogams training: Focus on identifying bryophytes and lichens; these groups significantly influence richness and accuracy, especially in uplands.
- Increase grasses training: More vegetative ID practice during training to improve grass recording accuracy.
- Improve photography and plotting: Emphasize including contextual features in photos; ensure photo placement is marked on plots; verify plot position relative to hedges/streams to avoid roadside vs fieldside errors.
- Tablet input improvements: Default presence/absence or streamlined input to reduce typing; develop smarter drop-down/auto-suggest features to prevent mis-entries.
- Monitor and manage cover values: Address high total cover values (some >200–300%) that indicate input issues; provide clear guidance on handling overlapping or dense cover.
- Input quality controls for cryptogams: Consider cryptogams as a core part of the QA process, with targeted checks to ensure their inclusion and accuracy.
- Consider two-investigator teams: To mitigate observer variability and improve reliability in plant recording over time, pair two surveyors per plot where feasible.

## Conclusion

- The Countryside 2007 QA showed substantial consistency with earlier QA exercises but highlighted notable weaknesses in plot relocation, bryophyte/cryptogam recording, and grass-cover accuracy.
- The estimated overall agreement on species lists (~65.6%) is lower than earlier QA years, reflecting challenges in upland cryptogams and plot localization.
- Implementing the recommendations should improve data quality for future long-term vegetation monitoring and more reliable detection of genuine ecological changes.
