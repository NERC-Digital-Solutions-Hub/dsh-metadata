# Quality Assurance Exercise CS2007: The quality of botanical recording across plots

- Purpose: Assess consistency and reliability of botanical recording within the Countryside 2007 Survey (CS2007) field programme.
- Scope: QA on botanical data across 8 plot types (X 200m2, Y 4m2, U, R, H, S, B, A) using 44 squares; 266 plots analyzed; QA conducted Aug 9 – Nov 2, 2007 (with some plots earlier).
- Context: Builds on prior QA exercises (1990 and 1998) to enable comparison of data quality, plot relocation, species recording, and data capture processes.

## Methodology and data capture

- Data collection
  - Standardised data sheets for all vascular plants and allowed cryptogams; 5% cover bands.
  - Blinded QA: QA observers recorded independently, then compared to CS surveyors' records.
  - Tablet-based data capture tested alongside paper forms to identify tablet-specific errors.
- Plot and plate relocation
  - Relocation aided by sketch maps, plot photographs, and metal detectors.
  - Surveyors relocated 70% of plots precisely, ~16% adequately repositioned (total relocation ~86%); 14% unsatisfactorily located.
  - Plate relocation by QA assessors ~70%, with ~36% of CS2007 plates relocated by surveyors; plate recovery by assessors remained relatively high across QA iterations (1990–2007).
- Data analyses and reporting
  - Comparisons used: species richness per plot, species frequency, and species cover.
  - Ten categories of mis-match used to allocate errors (e.g., mis-identification, overlooked species, mis-location, seasonal/management changes).
  - Additional metrics: percentage agreement, percentage efficiency (adjusted for QA changes), and cryptogam-specific analyses.
- Data quality controls
  - Teeth of potential tablet-related errors quantified; 2% tablet-entry error rate in a subset.
  - Annexes summarized square-level results and error allocations; analysis also considered landscape types and plot types.

## Key findings

- Overall data agreement and richness
  - Mean species per plot: CS2007 surveyors 17.49 vs QA assessors 21.67; CS2007 records are about 80.7% of QA values.
  - Plot-type performance varied: arable and hedge plots near or above 95% accuracy; upland and some smaller plots notably lower.
  - Across all plots, percentage agreement between CS2007 and QA2007 was 65.6% (lower than 1990–1998 QA exercises; 73.1% in 1998; 79.3% in 1990).
- Error sources and distributions
  - Major contributor to mismatches: species overlooked by CS surveyors (approx. 48.9% of errors).
  - Plot location/orientation errors contributed ~14.5% (J-type) of mis-matches.
  - Mis-identifications accounted for ~7.8% of errors; management changes and seasonal effects contributed smaller shares.
  - Uncertain location issues: 5.6% of total errors.
  - Tablet-related issues: 2.29% of species records contained tablet errors (missing, wrong, or extra codes; wrong/overstated cover values).
- Species groups and accuracy
  - Cryptogams (mosses, liverworts, lichens) recorded particularly inconsistently, strongly affecting upland plot accuracy and overall species richness.
  - When cryptogams were omitted, agreement and accuracy improved substantially across landscape types.
  - Grass species often under-recorded by CS surveyors; many forbs recorded reliably; grasses and cryptogams were the main drivers of reduced accuracy.
- Change detection and historical comparability
  - QA assessments show that, relative to earlier QA exercises, 2007 data were less concordant, particularly in upland plots, but more concordant for arable plots.
  - Differences in species frequency and cover between CS surveyors and QA assessors highlighted systematic over-recording of some species by CS surveyors (notably grasses) and overestimation of covers in many plots.
- Data capture and processing
  - Tablet entries introduced additional complexity; overall tablet-related errors were modest but non-trivial, and some observed errors resembled “mis-identification” errors from older QA exercises.
  - Higher total covers reported by CS surveyors for a number of key species; several cases showed significantly different mean covers between CS surveyors and QA assessors.

## Implications for data governance, sharing, and reuse

- Data quality and fitness for purpose
  - Substantial variation in data quality across plot types and landscapes; cryptogams and upland plots disproportionately reduce data reliability.
  - For longitudinal vegetation monitoring, inconsistent plot relocation and species identification can bias change detection.
- Provenance, metadata, and lineage
  - QA demonstrates the importance of documenting plot relocation methods, plate recovery status, and tablet usage, to support data provenance and reproducibility.
  - Records should capture reasons for mismatches (e.g., seasonal effects, management changes) to contextualize time-series analyses.
- Data curation and standardization
  - The need for standardized protocols for cryptogams, grasses, and cover assessments to improve cross-year comparability.
  - Clear guidance on handling missing or uncertain location data and on when to record updates due to management or seasonal changes.
- Tools and training
  - Tablet and data-entry workflows require improvements to minimize mis-entry and to simplify adding new taxa.
  - Training improvements recommended for cryptogams, grasses, and accurate plot delineation, plus enhanced photographic documentation.

## Recommendations (operational and governance-focused)

- Plot and plate integrity
  - No creation of new plates when a plot is missing; record best estimate only if necessary, but avoid erecting new plots to prevent data duplication.
  - Emphasize documentation of unsuccessful relocations and photograph/sketch evidence to support future relocation efforts.
- Cryptogams and grasses
  - Strengthen cryptogam training and standardize cryptogam recording procedures; elevate their importance in long-term vegetation monitoring.
  - Increase practice in vegetative ID for grasses during training and ensure more reliable grass identifications.
- Photographic and locational metadata
  - Stress the use of photographs with clear contextual features; ensure exact position references on plot sketches and hedge/stream plots.
- Tablet and data entry
  - Implement default or streamlined input for presence/absence or cover to reduce data-entry burden.
  - Develop an intelligent ID assistant for tablets (e.g., partial name matching, unique IDs) to reduce mis-entry and improve speed.
- Data quality monitoring and documentation
  - Maintain detailed records of seasonal/management changes impacting plots to distinguish genuine vegetation shifts from recording biases.
  - Consider permanent plots or fixed-reference quadrats to reduce relocation errors and improve long-term comparability.
- Reporting and transparency
  - Produce clear, accessible metadata and QA summaries for data users to assess reliability and comparability across years and plot types.

## Limitations and context

- Variation in data quality reflects human observer variability, training depth, and methodological differences; results emphasize the inherent challenges in large-scale, multi-operator vegetation surveys.
- Improvements in data governance should focus on standardization, training, provenance, and robust metadata to enhance data discoverability and reuse for future data stewards.

## Takeaway for Data Stewards

- Robust data governance for large-scale vegetation datasets must address observer-driven variability, cryptogam recording, plot relocation reliability, and the impact of data-entry tools on data quality.
- Implementing targeted training, standardized protocols, improved metadata, and better data-entry tooling will enhance dataset usability, discoverability, and the reliability of change assessments over time.
