# Quality Assurance of botanical recording across the plots CS2007

- Purpose: Assess the consistency and reliability of botanical recording during the Countryside Survey 2007, focusing on quality assurance (QA) of field data across eight plot types, and compare with prior QA exercises (1990 and 1998) to understand changes in accuracy and reliability.

## What was done

- Sampling and plots
  - 44 squares selected; one quarter of each square QA-surveyed.
  - 266 vegetation plots recorded across eight plot types (X 200 m2; Y 4 m2; U plots; and linear plots R, H, S, B, A).
  - Priority given to SQUARES with previous QA data to enable cross-year comparisons.

- Plot relocation and plate handling
  - Relocation of buried plates and plots evaluated using sketch maps, photos, and metal detectors.
  - Combination of sketch maps and photographs allowed precise location for about 70% of plots; 16% adequately duplicated; 14% unsatisfactorily located (similar to 1998 figures).
  - Plate relocation by QA assessors: ~67–70% recovered; surveyors relocating ~70% precisely, ~16% adequately; overall relocation efficiency ~86%.

- Data collection methods
  - Plots recorded on standardized data sheets listing all vascular plants and allowed cryptogams; cover assigned in 5% bands.
  - Some plots recorded twice: on paper and on computer tablets to assess tablet-related errors.

## Key findings

- Species richness (per plot)
  - CS2007 surveyors: 17.49 species/plot; QA assessors: 21.67 species/plot.
  - CS surveyors captured about 80% of the species present (CS2007 % of QA: 80.71% overall; plot-type variations: e.g., Hedge 94.01% highest, Arable 95.82%, U uplands 74.13%).

- Accuracy and mis-matches
  - Total species records (CS2007 + QA) = 6511; mis-matches = 2766.
  - Major share of errors due to overlooked species by CS surveyors (B category, 48.9%).
  - Plot location/orientation errors (J) contributed 14.5% of mis-matches.
  - Mis-identifications (A) accounted for ~7.8%.
  - Seasonal/management changes (F/E) and “mysteries” (D) also present.
  - Crude overall percentage agreement (T1 vs T2) = 65.6% (lower than 1998 and 1990 QA exercises).
  - After adjusting for seasonal/management/location factors, estimated accuracy of initial recording ~71% of actual plot species composition.

- Cryptogams (mosses, liverworts, lichens)
  - Recording of cryptogams was very inconsistent, notably reducing upland plot accuracy and richness.
  - When cryptogams are omitted, overall agreement/accuracy improve (cryptogams had a marked impact on upland plots).

- Species frequency and cover
  - Frequency: many common grasses and bryophytes under-recorded by CS surveyors; some species over-recorded (e.g., Anizantha sterilis under CS, Poa trivialis over CS in some years).
  - Cover: CS surveyors tended to assign higher mean covers than QA assessors for several species; notable over-estimation for Poa trivialis, Agrostis stolonifera, Dactylis glomerata, etc.
  - Tablet effects: tablet testing showed about 2% of entries contained errors; potential for overlooked species (≈1.6%) and mis-identifications (≈0.5%).

- By plot type (percentage agreement with QA)
  - X plots: 80.7% of QA; Y plots: 77.3%; H (hedge) plots: 94.0%; R (road verges): 79.5%; B (boundaries): 78.9%; U (upland unenclosed): 74.1%; A (arable margins): 95.8%; S (streamsides): 79.3%.

- Landscape and plot-type details
  - Low cryptogam-related accuracy particularly affected upland and moss-rich landscapes.
  - Arable and Hedge plots showed higher comparability between CS surveyors and QA assessors.

## Discussion and implications for data strategy

- Variation and reliability
  - Long-standing issue: variation among surveyors in field botany and cover estimation can affect trend detection.
  - Two-person recording is recommended to reduce observer bias and improve reliability, especially for detecting vegetation change over time.

- Plot relocation and permanence
  - Precise relocation remains critical; errors in plot positioning can inflate apparent turnover and bias change assessments.
  - Importance of permanent plots, accurate sketching, and photography to support re-surveys.

- Data quality over time
  - The 2007 QA shows lower overall agreement than 1990 and 1998 QA exercises, particularly affected by stationary cryptogams and upland plots.
  - Indicates need for targeted training in grasses, bryophytes, cryptogams, and cover estimation for robust longitudinal analyses.

## Recommendations

- Data collection and workflow
  - No new plates: if a plot cannot be found, mark as missing rather than erecting a new plate; avoid introducing new plots that complicate longitudinal comparability.
  - Emphasize cryptogams training and identification during courses; continue to monitor bryophyte presence as a potential indicator of nutrient status.

- Training and skills development
  - Increase practice in identifying grasses (vegetative ID) and cryptogams during training.
  - Improve photo and sketch practices; ensure photos include salient background features; clearly indicate photo position on plot sketch.

- Tablet and data entry improvements
  - Use a default “presence” for common species to speed data entry.
  - Improve tablet entry: implement predictive input (short-name IDs) to reduce mis-entry and improve retrieval of taxa.

- Data quality process
  - Maintain two-recorders approach for future surveys to reduce observer bias.
  - Continue cross-year QA to monitor consistency, and consider structuring QA to tease apart seasonal/management effects from genuine ecological change.

- Documentation and transparency
  - Provide annexed error taxonomy and plot-level/landscape summaries to enable end-users to interpret data quality and uncertainty in trend analyses.

## Conclusion

- The CS2007 QA shows substantial but varying levels of agreement with QA assessments across plot types, with cryptogams and upland plots posing the greatest challenges.
- While relocation and plot-coverage by CS surveyors have improved since earlier QA cycles, overall accuracy remains dependent on operator skill, training, and methodological consistency.
- Implementing the recommended training, data-entry refinements (especially for tablets), and careful handling of plots without erecting new plates will help improve data quality for future long-term vegetation monitoring.
