# Quality Assurance of Botanical Recording in Countryside 2007 Survey

- Purpose and context
  - Assess consistency and reliability of botanical recording across field teams in the Countryside 2007 Survey (QA exercise).
  - Compare 2007 QA results with previous QA exercises (1990 and 1998) to understand changes in data quality over time.
  - Focus on eight plot types across 44 squares, with 266 plots re-surveyed to measure quality of data collection, plot relocation, species detection, and data recording.

- Methods and QA approach
  - Plot types and sampling: Quadrats (200 m2 X plots, 4 m2 Y plots, 2 m2 U plots) and linear plots (R road verges, H hedges, S streamsides, B boundaries, A arable); 266 plots analyzed.
  - QA protocol: Each quarter of 1 km squares re-surveyed; initial CS2007 surveyors recorded plots blind to QA data; QA assessors compared lists and covers, identified mis-matches, and categorized errors.
  - Relocation and plate-tracking: Assessed relocation efficiency using sketch maps, photographs, and metal plates; evaluated both plot and buried plate relocation success.
  - Data collection modes: Some plots recorded on paper and on a computerized tablet to identify tablet-related errors; used standardized data sheets and 5% cover bands.

- Key findings: plot relocation and plate detection
  - Plot relocation: CS2007 surveyors precisely relocated 70% of plots, adequately positioned 16%, and inadequately located 14% (similar to 1998; slightly better than 1998 precise relocation).
  - Plate relocation: CS2007 plate detection about 36.4%, though assessors using the same equipment recovered plates at ~70% on similar tasks; true plate presence remained despite fewer finds.
  - Overall relocation effectiveness demonstrated the value of combining sketch maps, photos, and plates to locate plots.

- Key findings: species richness and recording accuracy
  - Species richness: CS2007 mean per plot 17.49 vs QA assessors 21.67; CS2007 recorded about 80% of species present, with notable under-recording in small plots (2 m x 2 m U and 4 m x 2 m Y) and better performance for hedges (H) and arable (A) plots.
  - Comparison to prior QA: QA assessors consistently recorded more species; 1998 showed higher concordance than 2007.
  - Accuracy of records: Of 6511 total records (CS2007 + QA2007), 3745 were common to both, giving 2766 mis-matches. About 48.9% due to overlooked species by the CS surveyors; 14.5% due to location/orientation errors; 7.8% mis-identifications; seasonal, management, and other factors also contributed.
  - Overall agreement: 65.6% of species records common to both lists (CS vs QA) when viewed as a proportion of the total species list; 1990 and 1998 QA exercises showed higher agreement (73.1% and 79.3% respectively).
  - Specialists and cryptogams: Recording of cryptogams (mosses, liverworts, lichens) was particularly inconsistent and reduced overall accuracy, especially in upland plots. Excluding cryptogams raised overall agreement/accuracy (all plots: ~66.8% agreement; ~68.5% accuracy).

- Data handling and tablet use
  - Tablet data entry introduced about 2% errors in a test subset; some errors involved wrong cover bands or missing/extra species entries.
  - Tablet-related issues contributed to “overlooked” and “mis-identification” type errors, but were not the sole driver of inaccuracy; training and method standardization remained critical.

- Species frequencies and covers
  - Frequency of occurrence showed many species under-recorded by CS surveyors, especially grasses and bryophytes; some over-recorded species (e.g., Poa trivialis) persisted from earlier QA cycles.
  - Cover assessments tended to be higher in CS surveyor data for many key species, indicating overestimation of total cover in certain cases.

- By plot type and landscape
  - Agreement and accuracy varied by plot type and landscape; arable (A) and hedges (H) tended to perform relatively better, while upland plots and cryptogam-rich plots yielded poorer concordance.
  - When cryptogams were removed from the analysis, overall agreement improved notably, especially in upland landscapes.

- Discussion and implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Inter-operator variation and plot relocation accuracy remain central to data quality in large-scale monitoring; cryptogams and grasses are persistent challenges for reliable long-term trend detection.
  - The QA framework highlights how non-structural factors (seasonality, management changes, plot misplacement) can inflate apparent change unless accounted for.
  - Consistent data governance practices (standardized protocols, metadata, double-checking data input, tracking of plot location changes) are essential to ensure data are fit for detecting vegetation change over time.

- Recommendations for future surveys (operational improvements)
  - No new plates: avoid erecting new plots when original plots are not located; note failures but refrain from creating new plots to prevent data drift.
  - Cryptogams emphasis: strengthen training and identification of bryophytes; maintain cryptogam data as a quality concern due to their impact on richness and upland accuracy.
  - Grasses training: provide more vegetative-ID practice during training for grasses.
  - Photographs and sketches: stress capturing photos with contextual background; clearly indicate photo location on plot sketches; verify photo/plot alignment before fieldwork.
  - Tablet data entry: implement default "presence" cover value where appropriate to speed data capture and reduce input errors; improve species lookup via streamlined input (e.g., short ID-based selection).
  - Data consistency checks: improve methods to distinguish true ecological change from recorder error (e.g., use two-investigator approaches, standardize plot relocation checks).
  - Communication of results: ensure transparent reporting of data quality and uncertainty when using monitoring data for trend analyses.

- Concluding note
  - The Countryside 2007 QA demonstrates meaningful progress in relocation and data capture but underscores substantial challenges in achieving high species-record accuracy, particularly for cryptogams and grasses. The outlined recommendations aim to strengthen the reliability of long-term monitoring data and support robust, governance-aligned environmental health assessments.
