# QA and bias in vegetation recording

## Executive Summary
- QA analyses of Countryside Survey 2007 indicate possible under-recording of vegetation species compared with QA experts, which could bias change estimates.
- Under-recording is partly expected due to greater expertise of QA team; changes in bias over time could distort trend interpretations.
- Recording of cryptogams is notably poor and has been excluded from analyses in CS2007, as in previous surveys.
- After excluding cryptogams, there is no significant difference in under-recording of species across surveys for species richness measures.
- Derived measures (e.g., Ellenberg scores) show bias differences between the 1990 survey and later surveys; 1990 often differs from 1998/2007.
- Recommendations:
  - Exclude cryptogams from analyses of CS2007 data (as before).
  - Do not apply general corrections to account for CS–QA bias in species richness results.
  - For derived measures (likely Ellenberg indices), apply a static adjustment to 1990 values to align with later surveys, using the differences shown in Table 3.
  - Implement the adjustment prior to full analysis; optionally adjust standard errors post-analysis using Table 3.

## Background
- Quality assurance (QA) is embedded in CS vegetation recording since 1990, with independent experts repeat-recording a subset of plots to assess botanical accuracy.
- Historically, QA reports show QA teams record more species than CS field teams; this difference is expected given expertise and remit.
- Previous CS analyses excluded cryptogams due to identification difficulties.
- The 2007 QA report suggested declining QA accuracy relative to field teams, largely driven by cryptogams under-recording. Supplementary analyses (excluding cryptogams) indicated reduced discrepancies between QA and field teams; a smaller matched-triplicate dataset (1990, 1998, 2007) showed no significant QA–field difference when cryptogams were excluded, though power was limited.

## Analysis

### Data and Statistical Methods
- Bias per plot was defined as the difference between QA and CS values; mixed models with square as a random effect and year as the repeated measure were used.
- Models estimated bias for each year and differences between years; a common-bias model aggregated across years to test for overall differences.
- Analyses included both full QA datasets (with cryptogams excluded) and a restricted matched-triplicate dataset (1990, 1998, 2007) for robustness.

### Species Richness Measures
- Across measures, significant bias exists: CS field teams record fewer species than QA teams, with magnitude varying by group.
- Time trends: little evidence that under-recording changed systematically over time, except possibly grass richness (p ≈ 0.045), which may not hold after multiple testing correction.
- Non-native richness showed no significant bias.

### Derived Measures
- Most derived measures (e.g., Ellenberg scores) show significant bias across years; Ellenberg light and radius were not always biased, while others (e.g., Ellenberg fertility, pH) showed time-related differences.
- In many measures, 1990 biases differ from those in 1998 and 2007; however, 1998 and 2007 biases are often similar.
- A secondary model allowing 1990 bias to differ from 1998/2007 revealed multiple derived measures with significant 1990 versus later-year bias differences.

## Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations
- There is measurable under-recording of species in CS vegetation monitoring, impacting derived measures such as Ellenberg scores.
- The difference in richness measures is expected and not a cause for concern regarding CS results; QA experts are highly experienced and under time pressure, so some disparity is anticipated.
- Cryptogams’ particularly poor recording quality is a recurrent issue; exclusion from published analyses remains warranted.
- Importantly, differences in under-recording across surveys can affect trend interpretation. When cryptogams are excluded, there is no significant change in bias of richness measures across surveys; however, derived measures show a notable 1990 bias difference relative to later years.
- Recommendations:
  1) Exclude cryptogams from CS2007 analyses, as done previously.
  2) Do not apply corrections to CS results to adjust for CS–QA bias in species richness.
  3) For derived measures (likely Ellenberg indices), adjust 1990 values to account for bias differences with later surveys, using the values indicated in Table 3.
  4) Implement the adjustment as a static, pre-analysis correction to derived measures.
  5) If necessary, adjust standard errors post-analysis using Table 3 estimates and standard-error formulas for sums of variables.
