# Quality Assurance Report - Analysis of plant species recording bias in Countryside Survey terrestrial vegetation plots Ð summary report

- Purpose: assess and validate the quality of botanical recording over time to ensure time-series integrity and reliable environmental signals (e.g., eutrophication, disturbance, succession).

## Background

- Countryside Survey field campaigns aim for consistent recording effort and expertise to prevent changes in botanical indices from reflecting recording variability rather than environmental change.
- QA surveys (1990, 1998, 2007) compared CS field records with independent expert records on subsets of plots.
- Prior findings: QA typically recorded more species, but no bias in species composition (as per DCA analysis) across 1990 and 1998.
- 2007 QA suggested a decline in recording quality, potentially due to less comprehensive bryophyte recording.

## Follow-up analyses (methods)

- Excluded bryophytes to align with previous surveys and reduce taxonomic variability.
- Focused on the “triplicate dataset” (plots surveyed in 1990, 1998, 2007) to assess changes in bias over time.
- Derived bias-correction factors using the CSQA dataset to adjust raw CS data.
- Reanalyzed data with a new modeling approach and examined potential drivers (survey timing, botanist skill, time between CS and QA visits) to identify if bias could be localized or require plot-level exclusions.

## Key findings

- Tablet PC data entry errors were minor.
- 2007 showed an increased proportion of overlooked species, suggesting bias due to survey effort rather than misidentification.
- Some observed differences in species richness and Ellenberg scores between QA and CS were ambiguous; overall effects were small but potentially meaningful relative to prior significant changes.
- Notable patterns: substantial under-recording of sedges in CS 2007 vs 1998 (QA recorded 28% more occurrences) and grasses (QA 17% more in 2007).
- The bias appears diffuse across the dataset rather than driven by a small subset of plots or individuals.

## Actions triggered

- Independent statistician reviewed the QA report; data gathered from QA plots assembled into a new database; indices recalculated for validation and bias correction.
- Reanalysis of triplicate QA data and full QA data using the new modeling approach.
- Investigations into factors (earliness of CS survey, skill level, timing between CS and QA visits) to determine if exclusion of certain plots is warranted.
- Development of bias-correction factors for all years and indices.

## Results of analyses

- QA analyses deemed sound, though some methodological details were not fully transparent.
- Triplicate dataset showed larger apparent differences in richness than the full QA dataset, indicating potential subset bias.
- A formal statistical approach produced bias estimates (CS minus QA) and their standard errors for each survey and index, enabling bias-corrected estimates.
- For individual plots, the only significant factor linked to accuracy differences was the earliness of the CS survey; earlier surveys tended to have lower accuracy, but the worst values were associated with skilled botanists, and overall surveyor skill did not differ markedly on QA plots.
- Across the total QA dataset (excluding bryophytes), a mixed-effects model found:
  - Differences in bias for richness across surveys were not significant.
  - Some Ellenberg score biases were significant but small in magnitude; thus bias correction is not universally essential.
  - Possible explanations include representativeness issues with the triplicate subset and averaging effects over many plots.
- Bias-correction factors were calculated for all years and response variables.

## Conclusions and recommendations

- Bryophytes should remain excluded from CS2007 analyses (implemented).
- No broad adjustment of CS results to correct for CS–QA bias was recommended or applied (implemented).
- For derived measures (potentially Ellenberg scores), an adjustment to the 1990 data to account for bias differences with other surveys may be warranted (implemented as static adjustments to derived measures before full analysis).
- Optional adjustment to the standard errors of 1990 estimates post-analysis could be made using computed correction factors (not implemented).
- Lessons for future surveys:
  - Improve training and recruitment of botanists.
  - Balance data quality with quantity.
  - Strengthen QC of plot recording during field campaigns.
