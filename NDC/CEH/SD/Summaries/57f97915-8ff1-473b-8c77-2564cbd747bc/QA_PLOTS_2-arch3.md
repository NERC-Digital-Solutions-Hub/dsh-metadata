Countryside Survey 2007: Quality Assurance Exercise. Appendix

## Overview
- Purpose: assess whether variation in CS2007 surveyors’ recording introduced bias into the dataset and how this might affect vegetation change estimates.
- Data sets used: Full QA2007 (532 samples, 266 plots) and Matched Triplicate (108 plots common to 1990, 1998, 2007 QA exercises).
- Modifications: cryptogams (mosses, liverworts, lichens) removed; presence/absence data used to reduce cover-variation issues.

## Data sets and modifications
- Full QA2007 data: 532 samples across 266 plots; CS2007 vs QA2007 comparisons.
- Matched Triplicate data: 108 plots with six lists (CS and QA for 1990, 1998, 2007).
- Common data handling: removal of cryptogams; data converted to presence/absence for analyses.

## Methods
- Univariate analyses: mean species per plot, paired t-tests, ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc tests; analyses also conducted after cryptogam removal.
- Time-series and group analyses: repeated-measures ANOVA and Wilcoxon paired tests for matched triplicate data; comparisons by land class (lowland vs upland).
- Multivariate analyses: Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) on full and matched-triplicate data; Ellenberg indicator scores (Light L, Nitrogen N, Moisture F) calculated and correlated with ordination axes.
- Outcomes: differences assessed via ANOVA, Wilcoxon, and repeat-measures approaches; outliers identified and removed as appropriate.

## Key findings (Full QA2007 data set)
- After cryptogams removal, CS2007 generally recorded fewer species per plot than QA2007, with an overall shortfall around 13% (except hedge and arable plots where the pattern differed).
- For land-class comparisons, the shortfall persisted in most categories; some plots showed smaller or larger gaps.
- DCA results showed Axis 1 related to fertility (Ellenberg N) with a strong negative correlation; Axis 2 related to shade vs exposure; Axis 3 less clear but with a negative relation to moisture (F). No strong directional bias between CS2007 and QA2007 in mean axis scores.

## Key findings (Matched Triplicate data set)
- Changes in species numbers over time show CS recordings generally lagging behind QA, even after cryptogams removal; the most pronounced declines were observed between 1990 and 2007 for CS, with QA showing smaller or different patterns.
- Species groups: grasses and sedges show notable declines in CS2007 relative to earlier CS surveys; woody species increases occurred in both CS and QA (parallel trends); forbs declined; cryptogams remained poorly identified in CS2007 (about 50% of cryptogams identifiable by QA in 1998).
- Sphagnum (a cryptogam) recording particularly poor in CS2007 (compared with earlier QA), though correct group assignment when present was generally good.
- Plot-type analyses (X, Y, Hedge, Verge, Stream, Boundaries, etc.) show mixed patterns, but several plot types indicate lower CS2007 species counts relative to earlier CS surveys; upland squares often recording less efficiently than lowland, despite cryptogam removal.
- Landscape-level patterns: upland plots showed more pronounced declines in CS2007 vs 1990, while lowland declines were present but less extreme; QA comparisons generally more stable over time.

## Ordination and Ellenberg associations (matched triplicate)
- DCA on matched triplicate data confirms declines in axis scores over time with fertility (N) most strongly implicated; axis 1 shows a measurable decline, but QA records show less change than CS in 1990–2007 sequences.
- Ellenberg N scores decline correspondingly with axis changes, indicating shifts toward species benefiting from higher fertility; Ellenberg L (light) and F (moisture) also exhibit detectable but smaller shifts.
- Overall, there is evidence of recording efficiency differences, but no single, simple directional bias that would invalidate comparability between CS and QA datasets.

## Epilogue: par scores and baseline adjustments
- Proposes provisional “par” adjustments to CS2007 species counts to align with CS1998 levels (excluding cryptogams) by plot type:
  - Hedge plots: no change
  - Boundary plots: +0.3
  - Stream and Verge plots: +0.8
  - Y plots: +1.9
  - X and U plots: +2.1
- These are crude extrapolations based on matched triplicate data and intended to aid baseline comparability rather than provide definitive corrections.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Data quality and comparability: highlights the impact of surveyor effects, cryptogam handling, and presence/absence approaches on long-term monitoring.
- Data management and governance: underscores the need for consistent protocols, comprehensive metadata, and openness about data processing decisions to enable cross-year comparability.
- Data availability and access: practical barriers to sharing underlying data emphasized (even when metadata gaps exist).
- Actionable improvements for monitoring: standardize survey protocols, provide targeted training to reduce inter-surveyor bias, maintain calibration exercises across survey iterations, and consider baseline adjustments or par scores when comparing across years with different recording efficiencies.

## Limitations
- Analyses rely on presence/absence data, potentially discarding informative abundance data.
- Cryptogams removal, while improving comparability, reduces historic comparability with earlier, cryptogam-inclusive datasets.
- Some plots/outliers were excluded to stabilize analyses, which may influence certain results.
- Conclusions about bias are nuanced; no overwhelming directional bias was found, but substantial, plot-type and landscape-specific biases exist.

## Conclusions
- The CS2007 data, relative to QA2007, show no strong overall directional bias in ordination axes, but exhibit notable differences in species richness and in recording efficiency across plot types and landscapes.
- The CS2007 results align more closely with the 1998 QA data along major ordination gradients, yet systematic under-recording by CS surveyors persists in several categories.
- The appendix provides a practical framework for interpreting and adjusting legacy CS data (via par scores) to improve cross-year comparability, highlighting ongoing considerations for monitoring framework design, data quality assurance, and governance.
