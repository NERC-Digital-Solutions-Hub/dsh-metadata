Quality Assurance Report - Analysis of plant species recording bias in Countryside Survey terrestrial vegetation plots Ð summary report

## Summary

- Purpose: Assess and quantify bias in botanical recording across Countryside Survey (CS) field campaigns to ensure time-series indices reflect ecological signals rather than recording effort or identification skill.
- Context: QA surveys in 1990, 1998, and 2007 compared CS field records with independent expert records to gauge recording effort and identify potential biases in species richness and environmental proxies (e.g., Ellenberg scores).
- Key issue: Potential decline in recording quality in 2007, with concerns that bias could affect core indices used for reporting signals of eutrophication, disturbance, and succession.

## QA 2007 results and follow-up analyses

- Initial finding: 2007 QA indicated a decline in botanical recording quality, possibly due to less comprehensive recording of common bryophytes.
- Follow-up analyses (excluding bryophytes):
  - Assessed bias using the triplicate dataset (1990, 1998, 2007) and data from QA plots surveyed in all three surveys.
  - Main observations:
    - No clear, consistent change in bias magnitude over surveys for most indices.
    - Some potential changes in mean species richness and Ellenberg N between CS and QA, but overall effects were small and comparable to prior survey changes.
    - Notable patterns: substantial under-recording of sedges and grasses by CS in 2007 relative to QA (sedges: QA 28% more occurrences; grasses: QA 17% more in 2007).
  - Technical issues:
    - Tablet PC software errors were minor.
    - The mismatch between QA and CS could be influenced by survey timing and surveyor effort rather than skill alone.

## Actions triggered by the follow-up work

- Independent review: QA report given to an independent statistician (Ralph Clarke) with input from CS statistician (Andy Scott).
- Method development: Development of bias-correction factor derivation based on the QA/CS dataset; planning for application to raw CS data.
- Data and reanalysis: New database of QA plant records created (excluding bryophytes); all botanical indices recalculated for validation and bias correction.
- Reanalysis efforts: Triplicate 1990–1998–2007 dataset reanalyzed; full QA dataset reanalyzed with new modeling approach.
- Further analyses: Investigated whether differences between QA2007 and CS2007 could be explained by early survey timing, botanist skill, time lag between visits, and plot-level characteristics; aimed to identify if bias was localized to certain plots.
  
## Results and key findings

- QA data quality and representativeness:
  - Overall QA analysis deemed sound, though some methodological details were not fully transparent.
  - The triplicate (1990–1998–2007) dataset showed larger apparent differences in richness than the full QA/CS data, suggesting potential bias in the small triplicate sample.
- Bias-correction factors:
  - A statistical framework was developed to estimate average bias (CS minus QA) and its standard error for each survey and botanical index.
  - The framework supports deriving bias-corrected means, standard errors, and confidence intervals for change analyses.
- Factors explaining bias:
  - The only significant association with accuracy percentages was CS survey early timing: earlier surveys tended to have lower CS accuracy relative to QA.
  - Plots with the worst accuracy tended to be recorded by otherwise skilled botanists; overall average skill did not differ markedly.
  - Bias appeared diffuse across the dataset rather than attributable to a handful of outliers or individuals.
- Total QA dataset analysis:
  - A mixed-effects model (survey square as random effect) on the full bryophyte-excluded QA dataset found:
    - Differences in bias levels for species richness across surveys were not significant.
    - Differences for derived measures (e.g., Ellenberg scores) were statistically significant for some responses but small in magnitude; thus bias correction was deemed less critical.
  - Reasons for variation: potential bias in the representativeness of the matched triplicate dataset and dampening of poorer censusing effects when averaged across many plots.
  - Conclusion: Bias correction factors were computed for all survey years and response variables; further work planned to better explain cross-survey differences.

## Conclusions and recommendations

- Recommendations implemented:
  - Exclude bryophytes from CS2007 analyses, consistent with prior surveys.
  - Do not apply a blanket bias adjustment to CS results to correct for CS–QA bias.
  - For derived measures (and possibly only Ellenberg scores), apply a static adjustment to the 1990 data to harmonize with later surveys.
  - Implement the adjustment to derived measures prior to full analysis; apply post-analysis SE adjustments if needed using existing correction factors (not implemented yet).
- Lessons for future work:
  - Improve training, recruitment, and balance between data quality and quantity.
  - Clarify QC processes for plot recording during field campaigns.
  - Consider data collection and access practices to facilitate timely quality assurance and bias-correction workflows.
