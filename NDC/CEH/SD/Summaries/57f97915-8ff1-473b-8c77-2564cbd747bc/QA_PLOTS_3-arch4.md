# QA and bias in vegetation recording

## Executive Summary
- QA analyses of Countryside Survey 2007 indicate possible under-recording of vegetation species compared with previous surveys.
- Some under-recording is expected due to the QA team’s greater expertise; changes in under-recording bias could bias trend estimates.
- Cryptogams are notoriously hard to record; CS2007 shows substantially worse cryptogam recording, leading to exclusion from analyses as in previous surveys.
- After removing cryptogams, there is no significant difference in under-recording of species across surveys for richness measures.
- There is evidence that biases in derived measures (e.g., Ellenberg scores) differ between CS1990 and later surveys.
- Recommendations: exclude cryptogams from CS2007 analysis and avoid corrections for under-recording of other species; if needed, adjust CS1990 derived measures to account for bias differences (static adjustment prior to analysis; possible post-analysis SE adjustments using provided values).
- Overall, while species richness under-recording exists, it does not drive changes in richness across surveys when cryptogams are excluded; derived measures require careful handling.

## Background
- Quality assurance (QA) is a standard, ongoing element in CS vegetation monitoring, using independent expert repeat recordings to assess botanical accuracy.
- Historically, QA reports showed experts record more species than CS field teams; such differences are expected but should not imply erroneous conclusions.
- Cryptogams have been excluded from analyses due to identification difficulties; 2007 QA indicated crystal-clear cryptogam recording problems contributing to apparent richness differences.
- CS2007 included supplementary analyses (cryptogams excluded; a matched triplicate dataset) to explore bias over time.
- This report focuses on analysing the full 2007 QA dataset (cryptogams excluded) to quantify bias and inform method recommendations.

## Analysis
- Data and methods
  - Bias per plot per year was computed as the difference between QA and CS field values.
  - A mixed model (plot as unit; year as repeated measure; square as random effect) estimated bias and its changes over years; a model with equal bias across years tested overall bias differences.
- Species richness measures
  - Most richness measures show significant bias (CS under-recording compared with QA), with magnitude varying by group.
  - Little evidence that the level of under-recording changes over time, except for grass richness ( marginally significant).
  - After cryptogams exclusion, time-based changes in bias for richness are not significant.
- Derived measures
  - Derived measures (e.g., Ellenberg indices) generally show bias as a function of species misidentification/under-recording; not all indices are biased (Ellenberg light and radius less affected).
  - Some derived measures (Ellenberg fertility and pH; and possibly wetness and light) show time-related bias differences, with CS1990 often differing from 1998 and 2007.
  - When modelling 1990 separately (1998 and 2007 tied), several derived measures show significant differences in bias between 1990 and later surveys.
  - Across 1998 and 2007, biases for many measures converge, but derived measures still display different bias levels than 1990.
  
## Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations
- There is a measurable under-recording of species in CS vegetation monitoring that affects derived measures (like Ellenberg scores); experts’ QA results tend to report more species than field surveys.
- Cryptogams recording is particularly poor in 2007; excluding cryptogams aligns 1990, 1998, and 2007 analyses more closely for richness, but the bias in derived measures remains notable.
- Conclusions
  - No significant change in richness-bias across surveys when cryptogams are excluded.
  - A significant difference in bias for several derived measures exists between 1990 and later surveys.
- Recommendations
  1) Exclude cryptogams from CS2007 analysis (as in prior surveys).
  2) Do not adjust CS results to correct for general under-recording bias between CS and QA (no blanket corrections).
  3) For derived measures (particularly Ellenberg scores), apply a static adjustment to CS1990 results to correct for bias differences relative to later surveys (use values from the provided analysis).
  4) Apply the adjustment as a static pre-analysis correction to derived measures.
  5) If needed, adjust the standard errors of 1990 estimates post-analysis using the provided SEs and standard-sum formulas.
