Countryside Survey 2007: Quality Assurance Exercise Appendix

- Objective and scope
  - Assess whether variation in CS2007 surveyors’记录 introduced bias into the data set used for estimating vegetation change.
  - Use two data sets: Full QA2007 (532 samples; 266 plots recorded by both CS2007 surveyors and QA2007 assessors) and Matched Triplicate (108 plots common to CS1990, CS1998, and CS2007 with QA counterparts).
  - Examine changes in species records with cryptogams removed and data converted to presence/absence for analyses.

- Data sets
  - Full QA2007 data set: 532 samples (CS2007 vs QA2007); cryptogams removed; presence/absence data.
  - Matched Triplicate data set: 108 plots (CS1990, QA1990, CS1998, QA1998, CS2007, QA2007) with six species lists per plot; analyses focus on time, surveyor (CS vs QA).
  - Modifications: cryptogams eliminated; data transformed to presence/absence to reduce cover-estimation variability.

- Analytical approaches
  - Univariate comparisons: paired t-tests and ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc tests to compare mean species richness per plot.
  - Multivariate analyses: Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) on presence/absence data; Ellenberg indicator values (Light L, Fertility N, moisture F) calculated per quadrat; correlations between Ellenberg scores and ordination axes.
  - Repeated measures analyses: among matched triplicate data, repeat-measures ANOVA and Wilcoxon tests to test effects of time and surveyor.
  - Within-plot-type and landscape analyses: breakdown by plot type and by landscape class (lowland arable, lowland pasture, marginal upland, upland).

- Key results: Full QA 2007 data set
  - Changes in species number (cryptogams removed)
    - CS2007 mean = 16.47 species/plot; QA2007 mean = 19.13; p < 0.001; CS2007 at 86.1% of QA.
    - Excluding cryptogams, most plot types still show CS2007 lower than QA2007, except hedge and arable where the difference is not significant; overall shortfall about 13% (across most plot types).
  - Land class comparisons (cryptogams removed)
    - Lowland arable, Lowland pasture, Marginal upland show CS recorded fewer species than QA; upland differences are pronounced.
    - Upland plots had large shortfalls in CS relative to QA; hedge/arable plots show smaller or non-significant gaps.
  - Overall interpretation
    - Removing cryptogams reduces some discrepancies but CS2007 still under-recorded species richness relative to QA2007, especially in upland and some plot types.
  - Matched triplicate results (1989–2007 context)
    - Mean species number including cryptogams shows declines in CS from 1990 to 2007, with QA showing smaller or later declines; significant ANOVA across six surveys (p < 0.001).
    - Excluding cryptogams, CS shows a stronger decline from 1990 to 2007 than QA (CS declines from 19.28 to 15.63; QA from 21.00 to 18.42; p < 0.001 for time effects).
    - Interpretation: a genuine decline in recorded vascular plant richness in CS2007 relative to earlier CS surveys, but the magnitude appears exaggerated in the CS2007 data when compared with QA or earlier CS results.

- Species groups and composition
  - Grasses and sedges
    - Grasses: QA shows declines 1990→1998; CS shows ongoing declines, with CS2007 recording about 10% fewer grasses than would be expected if the 1998 CS efficiency had been maintained.
  - Cyperaceae and Juncaceae
    - Cyperaceae: QA declines 1990→1998 with a modest 2007 drop; CS shows accelerated declines by 2007.
    - Juncaceae: declines 1990→1998 with little change thereafter; no strong evidence that CS1998 vs CS2007 differed in efficiency.
  - Woody species and shrubs
    - Woody species (excluding subshrubs): increases in both CS and QA since 1998; CS2007 vs QA2007 differences are small, suggesting similar surveyor performance.
    - Subshrubs and ferns: small changes; no clear national trend indicating systematic CS vs QA bias.
  - Forbs
    - Forbs account for about half of all records; overall decline in recording efficiency since 1998, with CS recording ~5% fewer forbs than would be expected if 1998 CS levels were maintained.
  - Cryptogams (allowable)
    - Identification of mosses, liverworts, and lichens remained problematic; matched triplicate data suggest CS2007 identified slightly less than 50% of allowable cryptogams compared to 1998 CS counterparts.
    - When recorded, Sphagnum types were usually assigned to the correct group (93%), but overall Sphagnum recording was poor (48%) relative to earlier years (86% in 1990, 77% in 1998).

- Plot types and landscape class results
  - Plot-type patterns (e.g., X, Y, Hedge, Stream, Verge, Boundary)
    - Strong surveyor effects, especially on plots like X and Y where 1990–2007 differences show CS under-recording relative to QA.
    - Stream plots show a clear, consistent decline in species per plot with CS results diverging from QA; Hedge and Boundary plots show more nuanced patterns.
  - Landscape class (lowland vs upland)
    - Both lowland and upland categories show significant declines over time; upland declines in CS appear more pronounced than in QA, though QA2007 levels are closer to QA1998 than CS1998.

- Ordination and ecological interpretation
  - DCA results (full and matched triplicate data)
    - Axis 1 (fertility-related; correlated with Ellenberg N) shows a significant but small difference between CS and QA; no strong directional bias between CS2007 and QA2007.
    - Axis 2 (shade vs exposure) shows smaller changes; Axis 3 shows weaker signals.
    - Ellenberg N (fertility) declines from 1990 to 2007 for CS (more pronounced in CS1998 and CS2007), with QA showing smaller shifts; this reflects a shift toward communities with higher fertility-adapted species in CS, an effect partially exaggerated in CS1998/CS2007.
    - Ellenberg L (light) declines indicate increased shading over time; Ellenberg F (moisture) shows weaker trends.
  - Correlations between axis scores and Ellenberg indicators support ecological interpretation, though CS vs QA differences at 2007 are not significant in axis scores, suggesting no pervasive directional bias in the 2007 QA comparison.

- Epilogue: adjustments for recording differences
  - A set of provisional “par” scores is proposed to approximate the 1998 QA-level recording if cryptogams are excluded.
  - Example adjustments (par scores) by plot type:
    - Hedge: 1 (no change)
    - Boundary: 0.3
    - Stream: 0.8
    - Y plot: 1.9
    - X and U plots: 2.1
  - These crude estimates are derived from matched triplicate analyses to align CS2007 with QA1998 levels and are intended as tentative adjustments rather than definitive corrections.

- Implications and conclusions
  - The QA analyses indicate systematic but limited under-recording by CS2007 surveyors relative to QA2007 assessors, particularly for certain plot types and in upland contexts.
  - Removing cryptogams reduces but does not eliminate differences; overall, CS2007 records fewer species than QA2007, and declines over time (1990→2007) are more pronounced in CS data than in QA.
  - Multivariate analyses show no clear directional bias in the 2007 CS vs QA comparison, but time-related declines and lower recording efficiency in CS data suggest cautious interpretation when using CS2007 for trend analyses without QA adjustments.
  - The epilogue offers provisional adjustments (“par scores”) to approximate 1998 QA levels, highlighting the potential to harmonize historical and current datasets for more accurate vegetation-change estimation.
