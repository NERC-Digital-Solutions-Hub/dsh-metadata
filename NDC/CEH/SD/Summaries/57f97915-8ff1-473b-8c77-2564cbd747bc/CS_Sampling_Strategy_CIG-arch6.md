# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
  - Emphasises that the current methodology is tightly linked to its predecessors and understanding earlier development is essential for interpreting changes over time.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative national ecological information.
  - ITE Land Classification used to stratify land into discrete classes (strata) with distinct ecological characteristics.
  - Use of 1 km squares as the sampling unit, with a centre square and surrounding squares to capture spatial variability.
  - National estimates are derived by combining class-level statistics (e.g., mean habitat area per square) with the total area of each class.

- Key methodological developments by period
  - 1978 – Initial Land Classification and first field survey
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to define 32 land classes from environmental attributes of 1228 centre 1 km squares.
    - Four surrounding squares per centre square also classified, yielding 6039 km squares in total.
    - Eight samples per land class were surveyed (256 total squares).
    - National habitat area estimates computed as the product of mean habitat area per square and land-class area.
  - 1984 – Second field survey
    - Expanded survey to 12 km squares per land class (384 total).
    - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey
    - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB; urban and sea corrections added.
    - 508 squares surveyed; collected data from the 1984 survey plus a repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats.
    - National estimates based on the 1990 Land Classification; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - 1998 – Revised Land Classification and fourth field survey
    - Further revision to enable separate Scottish reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
    - 569 squares surveyed; national estimates aligned with the 1990 framework but updated for the new classifications.
    - Results published in Accounting for nature (2000) and related works.
  - 2000 – Developments for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
    - Introduction of separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland).
    - Land Classes subdivided to create country-unit versions; total strata increased to 40 (then 45 with subdivisions).
    - Additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new classes; Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates.
    - Included an uplands module to improve accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
    - Summary data presented in Table 2 and Figure 5.
  - 2007 – Developments for Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-specific reporting requirements led to further Welsh class subdivisions (five new Welsh-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure minimum representation (6 per Welsh class).
    - England did not receive additional squares to compensate for Welsh additions; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained at four squares each.
    - Revised class maps produced for England with Wales and for Scotland; detailed CS2007 sampling figures provided (Table 3, Figure 6, Figure 7).

- Data outputs and references
  - National habitat estimates derived from class-level data and land-class areas for each survey year.
  - Key national reports include Countryside Survey 1990 (main report), Countryside Survey 2007 (UK results), and supporting methodological papers detailing the Land Classification evolution and sampling logistics.
  - Note on consistency: changing the basic classification used for national estimates affects cross-survey comparability; CS tends to favor using the latest classification for within-survey estimates while older classifications may be used for cross-survey consistency.

- Additional context
  - Early reliance on ISA for initial classification evolved toward using environmental surrogates (climate, geology, physiography) to classify every square in GB as computational capabilities expanded.
  - The strategy consistently balanced precision (adequate representation of each class/country) with practical sampling constraints, leading to iterative refinements in class definitions, country-specific reporting, and upland-focused modules.
