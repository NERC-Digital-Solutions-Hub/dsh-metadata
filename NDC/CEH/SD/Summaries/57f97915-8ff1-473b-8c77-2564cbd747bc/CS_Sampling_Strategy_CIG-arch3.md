# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy underpinning Countryside Survey (CS) from its inception to 2007.
  - Grounded in the ITE Land Classification to provide a stratified, representative framework for national, regional, and country-specific habitat estimates.
  - Aims to support monitoring of environmental change, informing policy and future decision-making.

- Core approach
  - Stratified, random sampling of 1 km squares classified by the ITE Land Classification to capture broad environmental variation.
  - Use of centre squares for classification, with surrounding squares allocated to classes to reduce bias and improve stability of class definitions.
  - Sampling intensity per land class chosen to balance representativeness with logistical feasibility.
  - Outputs include habitat area estimates, change statistics, and maps/reports, with results presented as charts, tables, and national estimates.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework
  - 1978 (CS1978): First GB-wide field survey using 32 ITE Land Classes; 1 km squares chosen at random within each class; eight samples per class (total 256 squares).
  - 1984 (CS1984): Land use focus; sampling increased by 50% within the same framework; 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - 1990 (CS1990): All GB squares reclassified to extend classification to all squares; 508 squares surveyed; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; results used 1990 classification for national estimates.
  - 1998 (CS1998/CS2000 planning): Major revision to allow Scotland-only reporting; Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; sample increased to address representation across the country units.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Implemented separate country estimates (England & Wales; Scotland); created country-unit versions of land classes; added 19 extra squares to bolster representation; introduced upland habitat module.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting emphasized; land classes subdivided into country-unit classes (5 new Welsh classes); total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added; upland/marginal upland module expanded to improve Wales and England Wales estimates.

- Country-specific framework and upland focus
  - Separate country estimates: England with Wales, and Scotland, with class subdivisions and aggregations to ensure adequate representation per country.
  - Wales-specific refinements addressed Wales-only reporting needs; additional upland habitat sampling provided stronger statistics for upland regions in England and Wales.

- Data, metadata, and comparability considerations
  - Changes in Land Classification across surveys raise issues of consistency for national estimates; debates on using latest vs original classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - The report emphasizes maintaining a coherent time series while adapting to policy-relevant country reporting (Scotland, Wales) and region-specific needs.
  - Outputs and tables document the number of squares, strata area, and sampling rates by class and by country.

- Outputs and policy relevance
  - Time-series habitat estimates and landscape change statistics to inform policy and environmental management.
  - Wales- and Scotland-specific results support country-level environmental policy and legislation.
  - Provides a methodological framework that underpins national environmental monitoring, landscape change analysis, and potential scenario planning.

- Challenges and considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - Ensuring sufficient data and metadata quality to verify class assignments and the representativeness of samples.
  - Maintaining up-to-date, comparable classifications while accommodating country-specific reporting needs.
  - Balancing the need for detailed, country-specific strata with the practicality of sampling a large number of classes.
  - Addressing gaps in representation for smaller or more variable classes, particularly in Wales and upland areas.
  - Governance and transparency around data sharing, dataset provenance, and methodological changes across survey iterations.
