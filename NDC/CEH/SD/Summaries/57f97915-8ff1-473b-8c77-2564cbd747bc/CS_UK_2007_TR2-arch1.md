# CS Technical Report No.2/07: Vegetation Plots Handbook

## Overview and purpose
- Describes the Countryside Survey vegetation plotting framework used to record plant presence and abundance across various plot types.
- Establishes a globally unique, long-term dataset enabling large-scale, fine-grained change documentation over time (four survey points across ~29 years).
- Introduces a digital data capture workflow (VegPlots) and tablet-based plot photos to improve efficiency and reduce transcription errors.
- Emphasizes matching data collection with relocation capabilities (maps, photos, GPS) to enable reliable repeat measurements.

## Data collection workflow and tools
- Plot data captured digitally using VegPlots on tablets; photos uploaded to a New_Plot_Photos directory; maps provided in ArcMap.
- Plot relocation relies on a combination of ArcMap plot maps, plot photos, and tablet GPS (non-differential) as an aid.
- Each survey uses a coordinated workflow: locate plot in ArcMap, open VegPlots, enter data, validate, save, and exit; photos accompany most plots to aid relocation and illustrate trends.
- Data enters through a structured header, listed species, and selected species sections, with datasets tracked per square and plot type.

## Plot relocation and adding new plots
- Relocation: if a previous position is uncertain, move the plot on the ArcMap map (not by GPS position). If relocation is not satisfactory, mark as Not Found.
- New plots: added when a previous plot cannot be found, new square is surveyed, or plot types are expanded (e.g., M, Y, etc.). New plots must be clearly marked (metal plate or wooden stake) and properly numbered to avoid treating them as repeats.
- New plot placement follows communication with mappers and adherence to plot-type protocols; landmarks and marks ensure repeatability.

## GPS locations and logging
- Historically non-differential GPS locations exist; for future surveys, surveyors are instructed to log GPS coordinates during data collection.
- On the ArcMap map, GPS locations are stamped with the plot type and number to assist relocation.

## Plot recording in Vegplots: data entry and validation
- Locate the ArcMap point for the plot, open VegPlots, and use the Standard Recording screen.
- Key fields: Select Plot ID, Nest, and top-right Plot metadata (Square, Plot Type, Plot Number, Plot ID).
- Tabs include Headers, with sub-sections for Plot relocation, Plot description, Vegetation height, Photos, and Plot Map status; Selected Species and List of species feed into the Nested structure.
- Validation highlights missing fields; data must be saved and validated before switching plots.

## Header and plot description data
- Plot relocation status (Found, Not Found, New Plot Replacement, etc.) and whether a plate was detected.
- Plot description: slope, aspect, shade, photos taken, plot map drawn; and map edits if applicable.
- Vegetation height is captured as modal height across canopy, shrubs, and ground layers.
- Admin: surveyors’ initials; completion status; notes describe losses or inappropriateness of a plot.

## Listed species and selected species
- Listed species: a series of species groups (Common, Grasses, Sedges/Rushes, Ferns, Forbs/Woody, Mosses/Lichens, Crops, Unidentified) with presence/absence and initial cover input.
- Selected species: species added to a plot as nests; estimated total cover per species recorded in 5% bands; cross-checks between partners to avoid bias.
- Nested plots (Nest 0, Nest 1, etc.) collect data at multiple scales within a single plot; total cover summarized across all nests.

## Plot-type specific protocols (summary)
- X PLOTS – LARGE, MAIN OR “WALLY” PLOTS (X1–X5)
  - 200 m2 plots with nested 4 m2 inner plots; multiple nests (0–4) within a 200 m2 plot.
  - Random placement in new squares; marked with metal plates; uses a 5-sector overlay to locate new X plots if land is limited.
- Y PLOTS – SMALL, TARGETED/HABITAT PLOTS (Y1–Y5)
  - 2 m x 2 m plots placed in semi-natural habitats or Priority Habitat (PH) patches; up to 5 per square, random selection when multiple patches exist.
  - Nested data collection across inner nests; PH designation selected from a list.
- U PLOTS – UNENCLOSED PLOTS (U1–U10)
  - 2 m x 2 m plots placed in unenclosed broad habitats; allocation based on proportion of unenclosed habitat within the square.
  - Up to 10 plots per square; random placement within habitat, with specific guidance for difficult relocations.
- Laying out and locating X/U/Y plots
  - Markers (plates or stakes) placed at plot corners; distances and compass bearings recorded on map/sketches.
  - Distances from boundaries and major linear features are carefully measured to ensure reproducibility (with rules to avoid overlap and maintain distance criteria).
- A PLOH PLOTS – HEDGEROW PLOTS (A, A1)
  - Arable field margin alignment adjacent to B plots; 100 m x 1 m plots extending from the boundary, with 50 m outward reach from hedge center.
  - A plots depend on boundary context and margin layout; presence of A plots may be limited by land use changes.
- M PLOTS – MARGINS (new in 2007)
  - Margin plots measuring 6 m wide beyond cross-compliance margins; placed to capture margin vegetation quality; placement rules depend on hedge/ boundary geometry.
- H PLOTS – HEDGEROW PLOTS (H1–H2)
  - Linear 10 m x 1 m plots along hedges; placed to the left of the hedge when facing from the field; minimum spacing relative to B plots.
- D PLOTS – HEDGEROW DIVERSITY PLOTS (D1–D10)
  - 30 m long plots to assess woody species diversity and hedgerow condition; extensive header data including modal height, width, gappiness, historic management, invasive species presence, and more.
- S/W PLOTS – STREAMSIDE AND WATERSIDE PLOTS (S1–S2, W1–W3)
  - Linear plots along rivers/streams; S plots placed near older X plots; W plots located in the center of waterway type within the square.
  - Headers detail stream type, watercourse condition, width, and freeboard; listed species recorded along the waterside.
- R/V PLOTS – ROADSIDE AND VERGE PLOTS (R1–R2, V1–V3)
  - Linear plots along roadsides and verges; starting at the soil–tarmac interface; verges must be at least 1 m wide.
- Aggregations/Combinations
  - Emphasis on recording to species level, with amalgamations for difficult separations (e.g., Cardamine hirsuta/flexuosa) when necessary to maintain cross-survey consistency.
- Bryophytes, Lichens, and Sphagna
  - Record only listed bryophytes/lichens with individual cover values; Sphagnum varieties listed with distinct categories (green/thin, red/thin, fat forms).

## Data management, accessibility, and quality
- Datasets are stored on tablets (A/B datasets) and later uploaded; careful labelling ensures datasets do not overwrite across tablets.
- Plot maps, photos, and Nest data are designed to be discoverable and usable, with metadata and clear provenance maintained.
- The handbook underlines the need for careful data validation, repeatability, and documentation to enable robust analyses and cross-square comparisons.

## End notes and context
- Publication funded by Defra and NERC partners; aims to build a long-term, comparable vegetation dataset across the UK.
- Includes guidance on legal use, updates, and contact information for the Countryside Survey project.
