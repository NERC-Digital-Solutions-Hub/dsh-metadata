# Countryside Survey 2007: vegetation plot data, Great Britain Dataset Documentation

- Two CSV files capture vegetation data from 2007 field plots in Great Britain:
  - Vegetation Plot - Plot Information 2007.csv
  - Vegetation Plot - Species List 2007.csv
- Ownership and rights:
  - Data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH)
  - All CS data usage must include an acknowledgment: “Countryside Survey data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology”
  - Countryside Survey © Database Right/Copyright NERC- Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. All rights reserved.
- Context and references:
  - Refer to Maskell et al., 2008 for detailed methodology and data handling
  - Key publications include Countryside Survey UK Results from 2007 (Carey et al., 2008) and related environmental zones documentation
  - The Countryside Survey project has a website with general overview and methodology links
- Dataset contents and field descriptions:
  - Plot Information file (Vegetation Plot - Plot Information 2007.csv)
    - YEAR: Year of Survey
    - SQUARE_ID: Square identifier
    - PLOT_ID: Plot identifier
    - PLOT_TYPE: Type of plot
    - COUNTRY: ENG, SCO, or WAL
    - ENV_ZONE_2007: Environmental Zone number
    - EZ_DESC_07: Environmental Zone description
  - Species List file (Vegetation Plot - Species List 2007.csv)
    - YEAR: Survey Year
    - SQUARE_ID: Survey square identifier
    - PLOT_ID: Plot identifier
    - AMALG_PTYPE: Plot type (amalgamated)
    - BRC_NUMBER: Species identifier
    - BRC_NAMES: Species name
    - NEST_LEVEL: Nest species first recorded in
    - ZERO_COVER: Percent cover in zero nest
    - FIRST_COVER: Percent cover in first nest
    - TOTAL_COVER: Percent cover in whole plot
- Nomenclature:
  - Species names follow Stace, C. (1997) New flora of the British Isles
- Usage notes:
  - The dataset provides plot-level and species-level vegetation data across England, Scotland, and Wales
  - Environmental Zones (EZ) provide a framework for regional analysis
  - Refer to the Vegetation Plots Handbook (Maskell et al., 2008) for field methods and data handling
- Data accessibility and discoverability:
  - Data sources should be tracked; datasets created may be made discoverable with metadata through portals
- Key takeaway for analysts:
  - Enables cross-site, cross-year analyses of vegetation composition and cover, linked to environmental zone classifications, with explicit plot metadata and standardized species nomenclature for robust statistical analysis
