# Quality Assurance Exercise for Botanical Recording in Countryside Survey 2007

- Purpose and scope
  - Assess consistency and reliability of botanical recording across many surveyors in the Countryside 2007 Survey.
  - Focus on QA of botanical data across eight plot types, comparing CS2007 surveyors with QA assessors trained to identify errors and mis-matches.
  - Allow comparison with previous QA exercises (1990 and 1998) to gauge progress and persistent issues.

- Study design and methods
  - Sample: 44 squares from the 2007 survey; within each square, one quarter targeted for QA.
  - Plots recorded: 266 plots across eight plot types (2m x 2m X plots, 4m x 4m Y plots, U plots, and 10m x 1m linear plots R, H, S, B, A).
  - QA process: plots re-surveyed, observers blind-recorded, and discrepancies analyzed by 10 mis-match categories (e.g., overlooked species, mis-identification, location/orientation errors, seasonal/management effects).
  - Location effort: assessed relocation of buried plates using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors; evaluated precision of plot relocation vs. plate relocation.
  - Data capture: standardised data sheets; comparison with CS surveyors and optional tablet data entry to assess tablet-related errors.

- Plot relocation and plate relocation findings
  - Plot relocation: 86.5% recovery rate (70% precise relocation, ~16% adequately duplicated); 14% unsatisfactorily located, similar to 1998 levels.
  - Plate relocation: surveyors accurately relocated ~36.4% of plates; QA assessors recovered ~67–70% when comparing across years; plate detection by assessors remained consistently higher than surveyors.
  - Plates still exist in the landscape, but relocation rates vary; effective use of photographs and sketches remains crucial.

- Species richness and recording accuracy
  - Across 266 plots, CS2007 surveyors recorded significantly fewer species than QA assessors (mean 17.49 vs 21.67 per plot); overall CS2007 coverage ~80.7% of QA values.
  - Plot-type variation: notably lower CS recording efficiency in most plot types; Hedge (H) and Arable (A) plots showed closer parity.
  - Upland and cryptogams: recording of bryophytes and lichens particularly weak, contributing to lower overall richness and accuracy in upland plots.
  - Accuracy assessment (concordance between CS and QA): overall percentage agreement across all species lists 65.6%; lower than 1990 (79.3%) and 1998 (73.1%); under-recording largely due to overlooked species (B category) and location/orientation errors (J).

- Sources of error and mis-matches
  - Total mis-matched species records: 2766 across CS2007+QA (6511 total records).
  - Main mis-match driver: overlooked species by CS surveyors (B category) ~48.9% of mis-matches.
  - Plot mis-alignment/orientation (J) contributed ~14.5% of T1 errors.
  - Management changes (E) and seasonal changes (F) contributed notable portions of T2 errors.
  - Location/orientation uncertainty (G/H) accounted for a portion of T2 mis-matches.
  - Tablet-related issues added around 2.3% of total mis-matches in the tablet test.
  - Cryptogams positively impact accuracy; removing cryptogams increased overall percentage agreement and accuracy in upland squares.

- Species frequency and cover observations
  - Species frequency: many common species under-recorded by CS surveyors; grasses and cryptogams frequently under-recorded.
  - Some species over-recorded by CS surveyors (e.g., Poa trivialis, Anisantha sterilis in certain contexts).
  - Species cover: CS surveyors tended to assign higher cover values than QA assessors in most comparisons; significant differences (Wilcoxon test) for several species, notably grasses and some forbs.
  - High total cover values were observed in some CS surveyor records, including anomalies (e.g., single species over 200%, some plots >180% total cover).

- Results by landscape type and plot type
  - Overall % agreement and % accuracy shown to be highest in certain landscape/plot types; upland plots, particularly those with cryptogams, showed lower accuracy.
  - Plot-type highlights:
    - A (Arable): high agreement and accuracy when cryptogams are excluded; otherwise variable.
    - X (200m2 quadrats) and S/H/R (linear plots) show mixed performance; U plots (upland unenclosed) particularly challenging due to bryophyte prominence.
  - Cryptogams: excluding cryptogams substantially improves both agreement and accuracy, especially in upland landscapes.

- Tablet and data-entry considerations
  - Tablet test revealed minor error rate (about 2.3% of species records had tablet-related issues).
  - Tablet-related errors included missing or mis-entered species codes and occasional omissions; overall effect dominated by broader field recording challenges rather than tablet alone.
  - Recommendations to streamline tablet use and reduce input errors (e.g., faster lookup, partial autofill, better drop-down selection).

- Comparisons with earlier QA exercises
  - 1990 QA: higher agreement/accuracy than 2007 after accounting for study design.
  - 1998 QA: higher % agreement than 2007; 2007 showed notable under-recording, particularly of bryophytes and grasses, compared with 1998.
  - Trend indicates improvement in certain areas (e.g., plot relocation by surveyors) but persistent gaps in species-level recording and cryptogams for upland contexts.

- Recommendations for future surveys
  - No new plates: avoid erecting new plates when the original plate cannot be found; record best estimate but do not create new plots.
  - Cryptogams: emphasize training in cryptogams identification, particularly bryophytes; these are critical to upland accuracy and biodiversity signals.
  - Grasses: increase practical training in vegetative (non-reproductive) grass identification.
  - Photographs: improve photography practices; ensure photos show position and background features; always mark photo location on plot sketch.
  - Tablet input: adopt defaults to minimize data-entry burden; implement efficient species lookup (e.g., partial letter-based search) to reduce entry errors.
  - Cover values: monitor and recalibrate cover estimation practices to mitigate inflated values; ensure consistency with field reality.
  - Photos and sketches: verify hedge and streamside plot locations and sides of features to avoid misplacement; review sketches before fieldwork to prevent roadside vs. field-side errors.

- Implications for environmental monitoring and data quality
  - Quality assurance demonstrates that field-based vegetation monitoring is susceptible to observer variation, especially for species-poor or cryptogam-rich plots.
  - Long-term monitoring using multiple survey teams benefits from standardized QA protocols, training improvements, and robust relocation strategies to maintain data comparability over time.
  - The study reinforces the value of permanent plots and dual-observer designs to quantify and adjust for observer-related turnover in species lists and covers.

- References and context
  - Builds on earlier QA work from CS1990 and CS1998; situates findings within a broader literature on observer bias, plot relocation, and vegetation monitoring reliability.
  - Highlights ongoing need for training, standardization, and methodological refinements to enhance the reliability of long-term environmental monitoring datasets.
