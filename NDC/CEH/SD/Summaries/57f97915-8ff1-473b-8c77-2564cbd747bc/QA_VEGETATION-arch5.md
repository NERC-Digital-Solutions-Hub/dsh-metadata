# Quality Assurance Report - Analysis of plant species recording bias in Countryside Survey terrestrial vegetation plots Ð summary report

## 1. Background
- Purpose: maintain time-series integrity by ensuring consistent recording effort and identification competence to avoid bias in botanical indices.
- Methods to reduce bias: categorize less-taxonomically demanding species, use limited cover data, aggregate by growth-form, omit bryophytes due to known censoring issues.
- QA surveys: conducted in 1990, 1998, and 2007 to compare CS field records with independent expert records on subsets of plots.
- Previous findings: QA generally recorded more species but showed no bias in species composition; concerns about 2007 quality due to bryophyte recording differences.

## 2. QA 2007 survey results
- Apparent decline in 2007 recording quality, potentially due to reduced bryophyte recording rather than skill loss.
- Follow-up analyses (excluding bryophytes and focusing on the triplicate dataset across 1990, 1998, 2007) sought to isolate bias changes and their impact on key botanical indices and environmental signals (eutrophication, disturbance, succession).
- Key follow-up findings:
  - Tablet PC software errors were minor.
  - Increased proportion of total error due to overlooked species in 2007, suggesting changes in surveyor effort rather than skill.
  - Ambiguity in whether bias between QA and CS progressed over time; possible threshold where differences in mean species richness and Ellenberg N widened.
  - Overall effects small but comparable to some significant changes in 1990–1998 analyses.
  - Notable patterns: substantial under-recording of sedges and grasses by CS surveyors in 2007 versus QA (e.g., sedges: QA 28% more occurrences; grasses: QA 17% more).

## 3. Actions triggered by the follow-up work
- Independent review: QA report shared with an independent statistician and the Countryside Survey statistician.
- Method development: Ralph Clarke (independent statistician) and Andy Scott developed an approach to derive bias-correction factors from the QA/CS dataset and advised on application to raw CS data.
- Data consolidation: A new plant species database was built from QA plot data; botanical indices recalculated for validation and bias factor derivation.
- Reanalysis: Triplicate QA dataset reanalyzed; full QA dataset reanalyzed with the new modelling approach.
- Investigation of bias sources: Analyses explored whether bias related to early CS surveys, botanist skill, timing between CS and QA visits, and whether effects varied by year; aimed to determine if bias was localizable to specific plots.
- Outcome: Efforts aimed to determine if selective exclusion of biased plots was viable.

## 4. Results
- QA reports review: Overall QA methodology sound, though some methodological details are not always fully clear; triplicate vs full dataset comparisons indicated possible bias in the subset.
- Development of bias-correction factors: A statistical framework established to estimate average bias (CS minus QA) and its standard error per survey and botanical index; enables bias-corrected estimates, SEs, and CIs for change analyses.
- Analysis of QA/CS2007 data (factors explaining bias): Earliness of CS survey emerged as the only variable significantly associated with lower accuracy; earlier CS surveys tended to show lower CS accuracy relative to QA. Plot-level bias appeared diffuse rather than driven by a few outliers; higher surveyor skill on QA plots did not systematically align with lower bias.
- Total QA dataset analysis (statistical modelling): A revised QA database (excluding bryophytes) was analyzed with a mixed-effects model (survey square as random effect). Findings:
  - Differences in bias for species richness across surveys were not significant.
  - Differences for derived measures (e.g., Ellenberg scores) were statistically significant for some variables but small in magnitude; bias-correction factors may be less critical.
  - Possible explanations for discrepancies include representativeness of matched QA/CS triplicate plots and the dampening effect of averaging across many plots.
  - Bias correction factors were computed for all years and response variables.
  
## 5. Conclusions
- Bryophytes should be excluded from CS2007 analyses, as with previous surveys (implemented).
- No adjustment of CS results to correct for CS–QA bias is recommended (implemented).
- For derived measures (potentially Ellenberg scores), consider adjusting 1990 results to account for bias differences with other years (implemented).
- Apply a static adjustment to derived measure values prior to full analysis if needed (implemented).
- If necessary, adjust standard errors of 1990 estimates post-analysis using the computed correction factors (not implemented).
- Document and implement lessons for future surveys on training, recruitment of botanists, balancing data quality and quantity, and plot recording QC during campaigns.
