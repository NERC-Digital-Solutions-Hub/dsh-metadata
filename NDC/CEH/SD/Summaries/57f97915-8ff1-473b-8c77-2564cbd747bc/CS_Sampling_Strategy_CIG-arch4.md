# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Traces the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and how it underpins the sampling framework across successive surveys (from 1978 to 2007).
  - Explains how national and country-specific estimates are derived and how classifications have been updated to support Wales- and Scotland-/England-focused reporting.

- Core idea: stratified ecological sampling
  - Use an objective stratification system (ITE Land Classification) to partition land into discrete strata that reflect ecological variability.
  - Within each stratum, samples are drawn randomly to avoid bias and ensure representativeness of the whole population.
  - Stratification helps address issues of variability across land forms, land use, climate, geology, and other environmental factors.

- Development of the ITE Land Classification
  - Origins: 32 land classes developed in the mid-1970s using environmental attributes (altitude, slope, rainfall, geology, etc.) and an environmental classification approach.
  - Method: classification built on centre squares of a 15×15 km grid; surrounding four squares allocated to classes; used to stratify GB for field sampling.
  - Evolution: classifications expanded and adapted to better reflect national and regional reporting needs (from 32 to around 40–45 classes, including country-unit subdivisions for England, Wales, and Scotland).

- Key survey milestones and sampling framework
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
    - 8 sample squares per Land Class; total of 256 squares surveyed.
  - CS1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - Increased sampling to 12 squares per class; total of 384 squares.
  - CS1990 ('All Squares' Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB from satellite data; included repeat vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping.
  - CS2000 (Developments of the Land Classification)
    - Class expansion and refinement to support separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland).
    - Sub-division of classes into country-unit versions; creation of 40 strata; additional squares added to ensure representation; upland habitat module introduced.
    - Aim: enable statistically reliable country-specific estimates and address under-representation in some classes.
  - CS2007 (Developments of the Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2007)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements prompted further adjustments.
    - Welsh-specific class subdivisions created (five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Wales received additional sampled squares to ensure adequate representation; England adjustments made where Welsh squares were removed.
    - Uplands sampling refined for Wales/England reporting.
  
- Country-level estimates and sampling design
  - Separate country-unit estimates implemented by subdividing Land Classes into country-specific versions and aggregating where necessary.
  - Additional squares were allocated to ensure adequate representation of new/adjusted classes in each country.
  - Some regions (e.g., Isle of Man) were treated separately or replaced in country-unit reporting to maintain consistency.
  - Acknowledges trade-offs between using the latest country-specific Land Classification versus maintaining cross-survey consistency with the original 1990 classification.

- Uplands module
  - An additional module in CS2000 funded to improve statistical accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
  - Involves surveying extra squares located in upland and marginal upland Land Classes.

- Output and interpretation guidance
  - National habitat estimates are calculated as:
    - Mean area of habitat per square within each Land Class × total area of that Land Class.
  - The Land Classification classification used for national estimates can affect comparability across surveys.
  - For cross-survey consistency, the 1990 (original) Land Classification can be used, but using the latest country-specific classification is preferred for within-survey consistency.
  - The framework supports both aggregate GB estimates and country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland).

- Notable methodological considerations and challenges
  - The need to balance representativeness with practical sampling constraints as classifications evolve.
  - Ensuring adequate representation of Wales, Scotland, and upland areas, especially post-devolution.
  - Handling data consistency when migrating between classifications while preserving interpretability of trend estimates.

- Acknowledgements and further reading
  - Acknowledgements sections recognize contributions from DETR, CEH, ITE, and statistical guidance.
  - References and bibliographic notes provide historical context and methodological detail for the Land Classification and Countryside Survey series.

- Summary takeaway for data leadership
  - The Countryside Survey demonstrates a rigorous, evolving data strategy built on stratified sampling using a formal land classification.
  - Key strengths include representativeness through stratification, country-specific reporting, and an explicit upland module for targeted accuracy.
  - Important governance considerations include documentation of classification changes, baseline methods for national estimates, and transparent handling of cross-survey comparability vs. country-specific reporting needs.
