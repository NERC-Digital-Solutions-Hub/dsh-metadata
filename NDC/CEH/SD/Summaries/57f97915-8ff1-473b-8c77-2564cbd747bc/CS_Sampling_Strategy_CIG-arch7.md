# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212
September 2011

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey (CS) field surveys from 1978 through 2007.
- Emphasises the need for a stratified, random approach to ensure representative sampling across Great Britain and its constituent countries.
- Links the sampling design to data products (land-class maps, habitat estimates) and to country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales-only in later years).

## Core concepts and beginnings
- Stratified random sampling is used to avoid bias and to capture variability across land types.
- ITE Land Classification translates environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) into 1 km square classes to guide sampling.
- Early method used centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; surrounding four squares (the 1 km framework) were allocated to classes to create 6040 classified squares from an initial 1228 centre squares.
- 32 initial Land Classes described by environmental characteristics.

## Key developments by CS surveys

- CS1978 (Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey)
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to create 32 land classes from 1 km squares.
  - Sampled 8 squares per class (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas as a function of class area and mean habitat per square.

- CS1984 (2nd Field Survey)
  - 12 km squares surveyed per land class (total 384).
  - Built on the 1978 Land Classification; results published later.

- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
  - Expanded classification to cover all GB squares; urban/sea corrections applied.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats; Land Cover Map of GB linked to the program.
  - Resulted in a revised, broader classification framework (still using a linked set of core land-class concepts).

- CS2000 (Developments of the ITE Land Classification)
  - Addressed needs for regional and local estimates; enabled separate country estimates.
  - Re-classification caused discrepancies in representation across countries; major changes included subdivision/aggregation of classes and new sampling to improve country-specific accuracy.
  - Separate country estimates implemented: England with Wales and Scotland, with 40 strata (later adjusted to 40 from 32) and additional squares to ensure adequate representation.
  - Upland habitat module added to improve accuracy for upland England & Wales reporting.
  - Summary: total GB sample squares increased; country-based sampling adjustments implemented.

- CS2007 (Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2007)
  - Responded to Wales-specific reporting needs for country-level policy and legislation.
  - Wales-only reporting increased precision; new country-unit sub-divisions added: five Welsh-English sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), expanding to 45 strata.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure minimum representation; some English classes retained with as few as 4 squares.
  - England, Scotland, and Wales maps updated to reflect revised country-unit classifications.
  - Summary: totals across classes and countries documented; overall 45 strata with focused Wales adjustments.

## Outputs and data structure for GIS use
- Land Classification maps: updated classifications for England with Wales and Scotland, and for England/Wales/Wales-only reporting in 2007.
- Sampling frames: spatial distributions of sample squares by class, country-unit, and, later, upland modules.
- Country-specific estimates: methodology remains the same (mean habitat per square within a class × land-class area), but with country-unit stratification and increased Welsh representation.
- Upland habitat module: additional sampling to improve statistical precision of upland habitats in England and Wales.

## National estimates and cross-survey consistency
- Note at creation of national estimates: changing the underlying Land Classification affects stock estimates; consistency can be achieved by using the latest classification for country estimates or aligning across surveys with earlier classifications.
- For cross-survey consistency, the 1990 Land Classification is used as a reference point in some comparisons, while 2007 and later classifications support country-specific reporting.

## Practical implications for GIS specialists
- Land Classification provides the spatial framework for stratified sampling and for generating nationwide habitat estimates at multiple scales.
- Data products require careful handling of country-unit subdivisions, especially Wales and Scotland, and the upland module, to ensure accurate, policy-relevant outputs.
- When integrating past CS data, be aware of changes in classification schemes (32 → 40 → 45 classes) and sampling allocations that affect comparability.
- Mapping outputs should align with the latest country-unit maps and class definitions, with clear provenance and notes on any reclassifications.
