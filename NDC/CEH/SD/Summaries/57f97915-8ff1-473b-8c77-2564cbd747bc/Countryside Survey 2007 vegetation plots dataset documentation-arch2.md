# Countryside Survey 2007: vegetation plot data, Great Britain Dataset Documentation

## Aim and scope
- Provides standardized vegetation plot data from Great Britain (2007) to support monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Data intended for broad, standardised analysis and reporting of environmental conditions.

## Dataset structure
- Two CSV files:
  - Vegetation Plot - Plot Information 2007.csv
  - Vegetation Plot - Species List 2007.csv

### Plot Information file (Vegetation Plot - Plot Information 2007.csv)
- YEAR: Year of Survey
- SQUARE_ID: Survey square identifier
- PLOT_ID: Plot identifier
- PLOT_TYPE: Type of plot
- COUNTRY: England (ENG), Scotland (SCO) or Wales (WAL)
- ENV_ZONE_2007: Environmental Zone number
- EZ_DESC_07: Environmental Zone description

### Species List file (Vegetation Plot - Species List 2007.csv)
- YEAR: Survey Year
- SQUARE_ID: Survey square identifier
- PLOT_ID: Plot identifier
- AMALG_PTYPE: Plot type
- BRC_NUMBER: Species identifier
- BRC_NAMES: Species name
- NEST_LEVEL: Nest species first recorded in
- ZERO_COVER: Percent cover in zero nest
- FIRST_COVER: Percent cover in first nest
- TOTAL_COVER: Percent cover in whole plot

Note: Species nomenclature follows Stace (1997). Data ownership and rights belong to NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.

## Data standards and references
- Standardised data collection aligned with Countryside Survey methodologies.
- Environmental Zones (EZ) framework used to classify plots (EZ_DESC_07 provides descriptions).
- Refer to Maskell et al. (2008) for the Vegetation Plots Handbook and detailed methodologies.

## Usage and outputs
- Suitable for analyzing vegetation across GB and comparing environmental health against standards.
- Outputs typically include reports, maps, and charts that communicate environmental condition over time.
- Datasets are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
