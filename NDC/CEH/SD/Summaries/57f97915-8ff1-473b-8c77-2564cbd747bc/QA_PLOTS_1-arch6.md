# Quality Assurance Exercise: Countryside Survey 2007 – Botanical Recording

- A QA assessment was conducted on botanical recording from the Countryside 2007 Survey to measure consistency and reliability across surveyors and provide guidance for future surveys.
- Sample: 44 squares were QA’d, each with one quarter of the square surveyed; 266 plots across eight plot types were evaluated.
- Methods: Plots were recorded first by CS surveyors and later by QA assessors (blind comparison); in 2007, a subset was recorded on a computer tablet to test tablet-related errors. Plot relocation, plate relocation, species lists, and cover were analyzed, with comparisons to 1990 and 1998 QA exercises.

## Scope and Plot Types

- Eight plot types: Q (200 m2 X plots), Y (4 m2 Y plots), U (upland/un-enclosed), R (roadsides), H (hedges), S (streamsides), B (boundaries), A (arable margins).
- QA examined relocation efficiency, species richness, frequency of occurrence, and cover, plus the impact of seasonal/management changes on species lists.

## Plot and Plate Relocation

- Plot relocation success: CS surveyors could relocate about 70% of plots precisely and ~16% adequately, giving an overall 86% relocation success (comparable to 1990/1998 QA).
- Plate (marker) relocation: QA assessors located ~45% of plates in earlier years; in 2007, CS surveyors re-found 36.4% of plates; true plate recovery by assessors remained high (CS1990 65%, CS1998 69%, CS2007 70%), with some new Wales plots affecting comparisons.
- Conclusion: Relocation methods (sketch maps, photos, and metal detector) are effective; plates are still detectable but harder to relocate consistently; photographs and sketches remain crucial.

## Species Richness and Recording Accuracy

- Overall species richness: CS surveyors recorded 17.49 species/plot vs QA assessors 21.67; CS2007 captured about 80% of the species present (down from 1990/1998 levels); richness was notably lower for small plots (74–77%) and higher for hedge (94%) and arable plots (96%).
- By plot type (mean species/plot CS2007 vs QA2007): X ~ 19.8 vs 24.6; Y ~ 12.2 vs 15.8; H ~ 18.0 vs 19.2; R ~ 20.6 vs 25.9; B ~ 16.9 vs 21.4; U ~ 12.8 vs 17.3; A ~ 19.7 vs 20.6; S ~ 19.6 vs 24.7.
- Accuracy and mis-matches: Total CS2007+QA2007 species records = 6511; 3745 were common to both, giving 2766 mis-matches. Major sources:
  - Overlooked species by CS surveyors: 48.9%
  - Plot location/orientation errors: 14.5%
  - Other categories (mis-identification, mysteries, management/seasonal changes, etc.) accounted for remaining portions.
- Overall agreement and efficiency:
  - Percentage Agreement (shared species / total species list): 65.6% (lower than 1990/1998 QA results of 73.1% and 79.3%).
  - Percentage Efficiency (adjusted for QA changes): results show substantial under-recording by CS surveyors, especially for upland and cryptogams; per-plot % agreement varied widely.
- Species groups:
  - Forbs and grasses were generally better recorded than bryophytes and cryptogams; cryptogams (mosses, liverworts, lichens) were particularly under-recorded, affecting upland plots.
  - Under-recording was most pronounced for bryophytes (particularly upland cryptogams) and some grasses; some species were over-recorded (e.g., Poa trivialis) or mis-identified.
- Frequency and abundance:
  - Of species occurring in 10%+ of plots, 19 were significantly under-recorded by CS surveyors; several grasses and bryophytes were among these.
  - Total covers were often over-estimated by surveyors for many common species; some high total cover values likely stem from tablet input issues.

## Tablet and Data Entry

- Tablet testing (90 plots): ~2% of tablet entries contained errors (mostly wrong cover band entries or occasional missing/misidentified species).
- Tablet-related issues could account for up to ~10% of overlooked species in a full QA run and sometimes produced improbable taxa on printouts.
- Tablet had a measurable but modest impact on overall data quality; main issues were mis-entry and occasional omissions.

## Species Frequency and Cover Analysis

- Frequency data show under-recording of several common species by CS surveyors, especially grasses; some species appeared more often in QA data than CS data.
- Cover assessment: CS surveyors tended to assign higher mean covers than QA assessors for many species, particularly grasses; differences were statistically significant for several key species (e.g., Poa trivialis, Agrostis stolonifera, Dactylis glomerata, etc.).
- Cryptogams notably reduced overall data accuracy in upland plots when included; excluding cryptogams raised the overall agreement/accuracy scores for upland plots.

## Data Quality Indicators and Interpretation

- Overall % Agreement (CS2007 vs QA2007) = 65.6%; lower than previous QA exercises (1990: 79.3%, 1998: 73.1%).
- On a per-plot-type basis, arable and hedge plots tended to show higher agreement; upland plots showed poorer agreement, driven largely by cryptogams and plot relocation variability.
- Across landscapes, cryptogams had a substantial negative impact on accuracy, especially in upland squares.

## Recommendations

- No new plates: If a plot cannot be found, do not erect a new plate; record the best estimate but avoid creating new plots.
- Cryptogams: Focus training on cryptogams identification; they contribute significantly to species richness and can indicate nutrient status.
- Grasses: Increase vegetative ID practice during training.
- Photographs: Emphasize the importance of good lighting, include contextual background, and clearly indicate photo position on plot sketches.
- Tablet usage: Set a default presence value to streamline data entry; improve dropdowns/lookup to reduce entry errors; implement better input recognition for species (e.g., shorter letter-based IDs).
- Address measurement accuracy: Improve plot boundary measurement and location accuracy to reduce mis-location errors; consider enhanced training on identifying hedge/streamside plot boundaries and locations relative to roads.
- Review and refine protocols for hedge/streamside plots to minimize location errors and ensure consistent plot overlap between CS and QA assessments.

## Conclusions

- The 2007 QA exercise confirms persistent challenges in field identification, plot relocation, and cryptogam recording, with CS surveyors under-recording species and overestimating some covers.
- Differences between CS surveyors and QA assessors quantify the reliability gaps and point to targeted training and procedural improvements to enhance data quality for trend analyses.
- The report emphasizes the continued value of QA exercises, permanent plots, and standardized methodologies to improve long-term vegetation monitoring data.
