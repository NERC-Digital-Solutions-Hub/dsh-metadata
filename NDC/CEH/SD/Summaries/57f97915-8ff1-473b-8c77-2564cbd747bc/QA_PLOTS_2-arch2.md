Countryside Survey 2007: Quality Assurance Exercise. Appendix

- Purpose and datasets
  - Assess whether variation in CS2007 surveyors’ recording biased the vegetation dataset.
  - Use two data sets: Full QA2007 (532 samples, 266 plots recorded by CS2007 and QA2007) and Matched Triplicate (108 plots common to three QA exercises: 1990, 1998, 2007; six lists per plot).
  - Time sequence analysis adds a longitudinal perspective across 1990, 1998, and 2007.

- Data processing and modifications
  - Cryptogams (mosses, liverworts, lichens) removed from analyses for comparability.
  - Presence/absence data used instead of cover values to reduce variability in recording.
  - Analyses focus on species richness, multivariate patterns, and Ellenberg indicator values.

- Key analyses
  - Species richness
    - Compared mean species per plot between CS2007 and QA2007 (cryptogams removed) and across 1990, 1998, 2007 for both CS and QA in the matched triplicate dataset.
    - Statistical approaches include paired t-tests, ANOVA with Tukey post hoc, and repeat-measures ANOVA.
  - Multivariate analysis
    - Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) on full QA2007 data and on matched triplicate data (cryptogams removed, presence/absence).
    - Axis interpretation linked to ecological gradients; Ellenberg scores (Light N O and F) calculated and correlated with axis scores.
  - Ellenberg scores
    - Calculated for each quadrat; correlations between axis scores and Ellenberg values examined to explain variation.
  - Matched triplicate specifics
    - Breakdowns by plot type, landscape class (lowland vs upland), and time to detect surveyor vs time effects.
    - Repeated measures analyses and Wilcoxon pairwise tests used to explore time and surveyor effects.

- Major findings
  - Bias between CS and QA
    - Even after removing cryptogams, CS2007 records generally show lower mean species richness per plot than QA2007 (significant in several plot categories).
    - The shortfall is modest overall (~13% on some summaries) but systematic, and not solely due to presence/absence treatment.
  - Effect of cryptogams removal
    - Removing cryptogams reduces but does not eliminate differences between CS and QA; CS2007 still lags behind QA2007 in many cases.
    - Across land classes, the CS under-recording persists, though the magnitude varies by landscape type.
  - Plot-type and landscape differences
    - Upland squares recorded less efficiently than lowland ones, even after cryptogams removal, contrasting with earlier QA patterns.
    - In matched triplicate data, grasses and sedges show notable declines in CS records relative to QA; woody species and subshrubs show different patterns, with woody species increasing in both CS and QA since 1990, while other groups decline in CS relative to QA.
  - Sphagnum and cryptogams
    - Sphagnum recording remains challenging; overall cryptogams are poorly recorded in the 2007 CS survey compared with 1990/1998 QA efforts, though accuracy for Sphagnum groupings when recorded is relatively high.
  - Ordination and Ellenberg relationships
    - Axis 1 of DCA strongly related to Ellenberg N (fertility); Axis 2 relates to shading/exposure; Axis 3 to moisture/fertility axes with weaker signals.
    - Across CS2007 vs QA2007, no major directional bias detected in axis scores or Ellenberg values when using the full dataset; however, time trends show CS series can exaggerate perceived changes in Axis 1 (fertility) and Ellenberg N compared with QA.
  - Time trends (1990–1998–2007)
    - For matched triplicate data, there are notable declines in species richness over time in several plot types, more pronounced in CS than QA in some plots.
    - The epilogue notes that declines in CS records between 1990 and 2007 may be exaggerated in CS2007 results, even after cryptogams removal.
  - Specific plot-type findings
    - X plots: CS shows stronger decline over time than QA; significant CS vs QA differences detected in some years.
    - Y plots: similar pattern with time- and surveyor-related differences; CS declines more than QA.
    - Hedge plots: declines over time; QA shows significant time effects, CS results show variability.
    - Stream, Verge, Boundary plots: clear time effects with CS2007 often showing larger declines than QA2007.
  - Epilogue: adjustment estimates
    - Provisional “par” scores suggest how many species per plot would be needed to bring CS2007 results in line with CS1998 levels (cryptogams removed) by plot type (e.g., hedges 0, stream 0.8, Y plots 1.9, X/U plots 2.1).

- Implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Data quality and comparability
    - Demonstrates the importance of consistent data verification, standardised methodologies, and presence/absence treatment to reduce subjective bias in long-running environmental monitoring.
  - Data value and accessibility
    - Highlights the need to make underlying recording data accessible to enable cross-study integration and re-analysis, aligning with the challenge of “increasing the value of datasets … by combining with other data” and “enabling others to access the underlying data.”
  - Guidance for future monitoring
    - Suggests calibrating CS2007 outputs against QA benchmarks or implementing correction factors by plot type to improve comparability with earlier surveys.
    - Supports continuing use of standardised QA processes and longitudinal analyses to detect genuine ecological trends rather than artefacts of surveyor performance.
