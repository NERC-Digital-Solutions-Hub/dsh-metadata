# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007, building on 30 years of ITE Land Classification developments.
  - Demonstrates how stratified, random sampling is used to produce representative, time-series ecological data for Great Britain.

- Core concepts for Data Stewards
  - ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework: environmental attributes used to define land classes, forming strata for sampling.
  - Stratified random sampling to minimize bias and ensure coverage of land types with ecological differences.
  - Time-series integrity: methodology tied to earlier surveys (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) to enable change assessment over decades.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification (key milestones)
  - 1978 (initial survey): 32 land classes derived from 1 km squares; eight samples per class (256 total); core basis for national estimates.
  - 1984: sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); data used to compare with 1978 patterns.
  - 1990: Land Classification expanded to cover all 1 km squares in GB; Land Cover Map linked; 508 squares surveyed; class adjustments with urban/sea corrections; national estimates recalibrated using updated framework.
  - 1998–2000: revision to enable Scotland and later England/Wales country-specific reporting; majority of squares reclassified to align with country estimates; 40 land classes expanded to 40+.
  - 2007: Wales-only reporting driving further refinements; creation of country-unit sub-classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total of 45 strata; additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure six squares per Welsh class; England adjustments to compensate for Welsh additions; revised maps for England with Wales and Scotland.

- Sampling framework by survey (square counts and structure)
  - CS1978: 256 total samples across 32 classes; 8 squares per class.
  - CS1984: 384 total samples; 12 squares per class; preserved cross-survey comparability.
  - CS1990: 508 squares; all GB squares classified under an updated Land Classification; additional land-use and habitat data collected; incorporation of satellite-derived land cover map.
  - CS2000: England & Wales (E&W) and Scotland country-unit framing; expanded classes to support country-specific reporting; added squares to improve representation of new classes; uplands module introduced to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - CS2007: Welsh sub-classes introduced; 45 strata; Wales receives 43 extra squares; some English classes reduced in sample to maintain overall efficiency; adjusted maps and sampling rates to support Wales-only reporting.

- Country-unit and survey adjustments (governance and data implications)
  - Separate country estimates implemented (England with Wales, Scotland); class sub-division and aggregation used to ensure adequate representation per country.
  - Isle of Man replacements and reallocation to maintain country-specific integrity.
  - Upland module added to bolster habitat estimates in upland England/Wales.

- Data governance and documentation considerations
  - Provenance and versioning: multiple land-class versions across surveys; need clear metadata to indicate which classification version was used for any given national estimate.
  - Data interoperability: reclassification can shift class composition and estimates; cross-w survey comparability relies on documented methods and class mappings.
  - Metadata needs: class descriptions, country-unit definitions, sampling rates, number of squares per class, and maps illustrating class distributions.
  - Access and reuse: results published as Countryside Survey reports (CS1990 main report; CS2000 scoping/UK reporting; CS2007 Wales/UK results), with explicit methodology to support replication and longitudinal analyses.

- Challenges and considerations for ongoing stewardship
  - Under-representation or small sample sizes in certain classes, particularly for Wales in earlier rounds; strategic additions addressed via CS2007 adjustments.
  - Changing classification schemes can affect comparability; the note on national estimates emphasizes choosing a consistent approach for a given analysis (latest classification for country estimates vs. original for cross-survey consistency).
  - Maintenance of an auditable trail for changes in sample design, class mappings, and country-specific reporting to support governance and data integrity.
