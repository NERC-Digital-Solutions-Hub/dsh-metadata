# Quality Assurance Report - Analysis of plant species recording bias in Countryside Survey terrestrial vegetation plots Ð summary report

## Background
- Objective: ensure time-series integrity by maintaining consistent recording effort and identification skill across campaigns.
- Strategies to reduce bias in indices: classify species by taxonomic demand, use cover data selectively, aggregate by growth-forms, and omit bryophytes due to known poor censorship.
- QA surveys (1990, 1998, 2007) compare field-team records with independent experts on subsets of plots; prior analyses found more species recorded by QA but no bias in species composition.

## QA 2007 survey results
- 2007 recorded a decline in botanical recording quality, possibly due to reduced bryophyte recording.
- Follow-up analyses excluding bryophytes re-examined 1990, 1998, 2007 triplicate data (plots surveyed in all three surveys) focusing on changes in bias, species richness, composition (DCA axis scores), and Ellenberg scores.
- Key findings:
  - Tablet PC software errors were minor.
  - Indicated increase in overlooked species in 2007, suggesting bias tied to surveyor effort rather than skill.
  - Mixed signals on bias over time; potential threshold where CS–QA differences in mean richness and Ellenberg N grew with time.
  - Overall effects small but comparable to significant changes seen previously.
  - Notable under-recording of sedges and to a lesser extent grasses in 2007 by CS surveyors.

## Actions triggered by the follow-up work
- Independent statistician review of QA report; data re-analysis planned.
- Development of bias-correction factors using the QA/CS dataset; preparation for applying corrections to raw CS data.
- Creation of a new plant-record database from QA plots; calculation of botanical indices for validation and correction.
- Reanalysis of triplicate QA dataset (1990, 1998, 2007) and reanalysis of full QA data with new modelling approach.
- Investigations into whether bias could be explained by early survey timing, botanical skill, visit timing, or other factors; assessment of localised vs diffuse bias and potential plot exclusions.

## Results
- QA inspection: methods sometimes under-documented; triplicate subset may not be representative of full plot population.
- Development of bias-correction factors: statistical approach to estimate average bias (CS minus QA) and its standard error for each survey and botanical index; enables bias-corrected means, SEs, and CIs for change analyses.
- Factor analysis: early CS surveys linked to lower accuracy relative to QA; overall CS QA plots tended to have slightly higher surveyor skill, but bias was diffuse across plots.
- Modelling across all QA data (bryophytes excluded):
  - Mixed-effects model (survey square as random effect) showed no significant differences in bias for species richness across surveys.
  - Some Ellenberg-related measures showed significant but small biases; overall less justification for broad bias correction.
  - Possible reasons for differing conclusions: representativeness of the matched triplicate dataset and dampening effects when averaging across many plots.
- Conclusions from modeling: bias-correction factors exist for all years/variables; differences in conclusions attributed to dataset representativeness and averaging effects; further work planned to refine explanations.

## Conclusions and recommendations
- Bryophytes should continue to be excluded from CS2007 analyses (and prior surveys) as per implemented practice.
- No overall adjustment of CS results to correct for CS–QA bias is recommended or implemented.
- For derived measures (potentially Ellenberg scores), a targeted adjustment to the 1990 data to align with other surveys is recommended and implemented.
- Apply a static adjustment to derived measure values prior to full analysis; adjustment to standard errors for 1990 remains optional and not implemented.
- Document and incorporate lessons for future surveys on training, recruitment, data quantity vs. quality, and plot recording QC.
