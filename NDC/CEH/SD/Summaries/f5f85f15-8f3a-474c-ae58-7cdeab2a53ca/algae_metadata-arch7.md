# Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Overview
- Metadata and results from phytoplankton cell counts in Durleigh Reservoir during 2018.
- Aim: better understand phytoplankton dynamics in the reservoir.

## Spatial and Temporal Coverage
- Dates: 22/02/2018 to 05/10/2018 (dd/mm/yyyy).
- Sampling locations (three): 
  - Location 1: 51.1213, -3.0400
  - Location 2: 51.1210, -3.0403
  - Location 3: 51.1215, -3.0445
- Note: Location 3 inaccessible on 05/04/2018; no data for that date at that site.
- Depths sampled at each location: surface (L1S), middle (L1M), bottom (L1B); depths in metres.

## Data Content and Format
- Counts: phytoplankton cell counts in cells/ml.
- Community structure categories: cyanobacteria (BGA), greens, diatoms, others.
- Records include total phytoplankton counts and counts for specific species.
- Sample identifiers reflect location and depth (e.g., L1M = Location 1, middle depth).
- Date format: dd/mm/yyyy.

## Sampling Methods and Processing
- Sampling method: van dorn water sampler following Wessex Water protocol.
- Collected by: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain (throughout 2018).
- Processing and analysis: Emily Slavin, Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
- Concentration: membrane filtration prior to identification/enumeration.
- Identification instrument: Olympus BH2 light microscope.
- Counting: minimum of 30 fields of view per sample.

## Data Structure and GIS Use
- Suitable for map-based analyses and visualization of spatial and temporal phytoplankton patterns.
- GIS-ready fields include: location coordinates, date, depth (L1S/L1M/L1B), total counts, counts by phytoplankton group, and species counts.

## Data Quality and Notes
- Data gaps where sampling location 3 was inaccessible on 05/04/2018.
- Data combines multiple resolutions (location, depth, date) to form a comprehensive time-series/spatial dataset.
- Location coordinates provided in decimal degrees; date values follow dd/mm/yyyy.
