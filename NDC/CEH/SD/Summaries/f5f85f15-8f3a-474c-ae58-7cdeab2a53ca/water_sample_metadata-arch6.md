# Water chemistry samples from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

- Purpose: Data collected to assess in-reservoir water quality in 2018, capturing a wide range of chemical and physical parameters to enable analysis and potential self-service exploration (e.g., dashboards, reports).
- Data scope: Multi-parameter water chemistry dataset with spatial (three locations) and vertical (surface, middle, bottom) resolution over 2018, processed for quality control and reporting. Some parameters may be missing for certain dates due to laboratory processing frequency.

## Sampling details

- Date range: 22-Feb-2018 to 05-Oct-2018 (dates in dataset follow dd-mmm-yyyy format).
- Locations:
  - Location 1: lat 51.1213, lon -3.0400
  - Location 2: lat 51.1210, lon -3.0403
  - Location 3: lat 51.1215, lon -3.0445
- Access: All locations sampled by boat.
- Gaps: Location 3 inaccessible on 05-Apr-2018; no values for that date at Location 3.
- Depths sampled: L1S (surface), L1M (middle), L1B (bottom) — depths vary with water level through the year.
- Sampling method: Van Dorn water sampler following Wessex Water protocol for metals, inorganics, T&O metabolites, and BOD.

## Data collection and processing

- Collected by: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
- Laboratory processing: Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
- Quality notes: Some parameters not reported when laboratory processing frequency increased.
- Units and data qualifiers: Concentrations reported as <0.02 to indicate detection limit; various parameters reported in their respective units (e.g., mg/l, NTU, ng/l, °C).

## Parameters and analytical methods

- Physical and chemical parameters (with methods):
  - Suspended solids
  - Turbidity (NTU) — Turbidimeter
  - Conductivity
  - pH
  - Alkalinity
  - Ammonia (mg/l)
  - TON (mg/l) — sulphanilamide/N-1-napthylethylene-diamine dihydrochloride method with nitrate reduced first
  - Nitrite (mg/l) — sulphanilamide/N-1-napthylethylene-diamine dihydrochloride method
  - Nitrate (mg/l) — TON concentration minus nitrite concentration
  - Ammonium (mg/l) — sodium salicylate/sodium nitroferricyanide method
  - Orthophosphate (mg/l) — ascorbic acid method
  - Sulphate (mg/l)
  - Chloride (mg/l)
  - Silica (mg/l)
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Sodium (mg/l)
  - Magnesium (mg/l)
  - Aluminium (total and soluble) (mg/l)
  - Potassium (mg/l)
  - Calcium (mg/l)
  - Manganese (total and soluble) (mg/l) — ICP-MS
  - Iron (total and soluble) (mg/l) — ICP-MS
  - Copper (total and soluble) — ICP-MS
  - Zinc (total and soluble) — ICP-MS
  - Geosmin — GC/MS/MS (total) (ng/l)
  - MIB — GC/MS/MS (ng/l)
- Special notes on MIB/Geosmin: Extracted via solid-phase extraction; eluted with dichloromethane.
- Quality assurance: Calibration standards, analytical quality control, and blanks processed alongside test samples.
- Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD): 5-day incubation at 20°C (mg O2/l); measured only at surface and bottom of Location 1 on 21/22/23 August 2018.

## Data quality and caveats

- Some parameters not reported when processing frequency increased; data may be patchy across dates.
- Depth-location combinations do not exist for all dates (e.g., Location 3 on 05-Apr-2018 has no data).
- Detection limits indicated by <0.02 values; units vary by parameter.
