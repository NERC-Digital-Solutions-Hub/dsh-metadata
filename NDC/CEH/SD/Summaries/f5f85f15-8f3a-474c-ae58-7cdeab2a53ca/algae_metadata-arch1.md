# Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Overview
- metadata and results from phytoplankton cell counts in Durleigh Reservoir during 2018
- sampling period: 22 February 2018 to 5 October 2018
- three sampling locations accessed by boat; samples collected at three depths per location
- counts reported as cells per millilitre (cells/ml)
- community structure categories: cyanobacteria (BGA), greens, diatoms, and others
- both total counts and counts for specific phytoplankton species are provided

## Data scope and structure
- sampling locations: Location 1, Location 2, Location 3
  - Location 1: lat 51.1213, lon -3.0400
  - Location 2: lat 51.1210, lon -3.0403
  - Location 3: lat 51.1215, lon -3.0445
- dates: date of each water sample (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - note: on 5 April 2018, Location 3 was inaccessible; no data for that date
- depths per location: surface, middle, bottom
  - depth codes used in dataset: L1S (surface), L1M (middle), L1B (bottom)
- depths are measured in metres
- sampling and processing team
  - collected by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain (throughout 2018)
  - processed and analysed by Emily Slavin at Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford
- sample processing
  - concentration by membrane filtration
  - enumeration using an Olympus BH2 light microscope
  - minimum of 30 fields of view counted per sample

## Data fields and measurements
- total phytoplankton cell counts per sample (cells/ml)
- counts for specific phytoplankton species (per sample)
- community structure composition per sample: cyanobacteria (BGA), greens, diatoms, others

## Methods and provenance
- sampling protocol: van dorn water sampler following Wessex Water protocols
- data file is a metadata/file accompanying the counts
- dataset citation: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018
- dataset authorship and processing details are provided to enable reproducibility and verification

## Quality, limitations, and considerations
- date format: dd/mm/yyyy
- missing data: no data for Location 3 on 5 April 2018 due to inaccessibility
- counts are per sample; documentation notes at least 30 fields of view per count, supporting measurement reliability
- data may be used for analyses of spatial (location), temporal (date), and depth-related phytoplankton dynamics, including shifts in community structure and species-specific trends

## Usage and potential analyses
- analyze correlations between location, depth, and phytoplankton community structure
- compare total counts with the proportions of cyanobacteria, greens, diatoms, and others
- investigate temporal trends across the sampling period and across locations
- model species-specific counts and overall phytoplankton dynamics, using the provided metadata (coordinates, date, depth codes)
