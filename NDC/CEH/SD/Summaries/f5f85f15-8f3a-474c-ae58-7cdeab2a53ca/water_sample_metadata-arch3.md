# Water chemistry samples from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Overview
- Dataset of water chemistry samples collected in 2018 from Durleigh Reservoir to assess in-reservoir water quality.
- Collected by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain; processed at Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
- Sampling device: Van Dorn water sampler; protocol aligned with Wessex Water procedures for metals, inorganics, T&O metabolites, and BOD.
- Timeframe: samples gathered between 22 February 2018 and 5 October 2018.
- Purpose: to monitor water quality across the reservoir over 2018.

## Sampling design and locations
- Sampling locations: three locations in Durleigh Reservoir; locations accessed by boat.
- Coordinates provided for each location (latitude and longitude).
- Date-specific note: on 5 April 2018, location 3 was inaccessible, so no data for that date at that location.
- Depths at each location: three depths per location – surface (L1S), middle (L1M), bottom (L1B); depth labels reflect sampling depth within the water column, which varied with water level.

## Parameters, methods, and reporting
- Measurements include: Suspended solids, Turbidity (NTU, measured with Turbidimeter), Conductivity, pH, Alkalinity, Ammonia, TON, Nitrite, Nitrate, Ammonium, Orthophosphate, Sulphate, chloride, Silica, Temperature, Sodium, Magnesium, Aluminium (total and soluble), Potassium, Calcium, Manganese (total and soluble, measured by ICP-MS), Iron (total and soluble, ICP-MS), Copper (total and soluble), Zinc (total and soluble), Geosmin (total, GC/MS/MS), and MIB (total, GC/MS/MS).
- Analytical methods: 
  - Metals and inorganics via ICP-MS for Mn/Fe (and other elements as listed),
  - Geosmin and MIB analyzed by GC/MS/MS with solid-phase extraction (SPE) and dichloromethane elution.
  - Orthophosphate via ascorbic acid method; TON, nitrite, nitrate via sulphanilamide/N-1-napthylethylene-diamine methods with nitrate reduction where applicable.
  - Turbidity via Turbidimeter; temperature, conductivity, pH, alkalinity by standard water-quality methods.
- Quality control: calibration standards, analytical quality control, and blanks run alongside test samples.
- Detection limits: several concentrations reported as "<0.02" indicating level of detection.
- BOD: Biochemical Oxygen Demand (5-day) measured at 20°C; only at surface and bottom of location 1 on 21/22/23 August 2018.

## Data quality, metadata, and limitations
- Some parameters were not reported on certain dates due to changes in processing frequency at the Wessex Water laboratory.
- Data include explicit date (dd-mmm-yyyy) and time (HH:MM) formats.
- Location 3 data missing for 5 April 2018 due to inaccessibility.
- Depth labeling (L1S, L1M, L1B) corresponds to sampling depths; vertical profiling is subject to water-level variations.

## Data governance, usage, and citation
- Citation: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Water chemistry samples from Durleigh Reservoir 2018.
- Data provenance: samples collected by the named researchers and processed at Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
- Purpose for monitoring frameworks: supports evaluation of reservoir water quality and informs future monitoring decisions, with attention to metadata completeness, data availability, and gaps due to processing frequency and accessibility.
- Access considerations: dataset metadata provided; public sharing of underlying data encouraged as part of data governance, with standard citation required for reuse.
