# Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

- Purpose and content
  - Dataset to understand phytoplankton dynamics in Durleigh Reservoir during 2018.
  - Provides total phytoplankton cell counts (cells/ml) and counts by community structure (cyanobacteria/BGA, greens, diatoms, others) plus species-level counts.
  - Includes counts for samples collected at three locations and three depths over time.

- Sampling design and scope
  - Timeframe: 22 February 2018 to 5 October 2018.
  - Locations: three sampling locations at Durleigh Reservoir.
  - Coordinates (lat, lon) provided for each location.
  - Depths: three levels per location (surface, middle, bottom) referred to as L1S, L1M, L1B; depths are in metres.
  - Data gap: on 5 April 2018, location 3 was inaccessible; no data for that date/location.
  - Sampling method: van dorn water sampler following Wessex Water protocol.

- Data collection and processing
  - Collectors: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain (throughout 2018).
  - Processing/analysis: Emily Slavin at Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
  - Sample preparation: membrane filtration prior to identification and enumeration.
  - Counting method: Olympus BH2 light microscope; a minimum of 30 fields of view counted per sample.

- Data structure and outputs
  - Units: counts reported as cells/ml.
  - Outputs include: 
    - total phytoplankton cell counts per sample,
    - community structure counts (cyanobacteria/BGA, greens, diatoms, others),
    - counts for specific species.
  - Dataset format notes: date format is dd/mm/yyyy.

- Metadata, provenance, and citation
  - Metadata includes sampling locations, depths, dates, coordinates, and counting methodology.
