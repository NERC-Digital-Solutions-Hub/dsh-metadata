# Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Overview
- Dataset of phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir for 2018, focusing on dynamics within the reservoir.
- Timeframe: samples collected between 22 February 2018 and 5 October 2018.
- Collected and analyzed to understand phytoplankton community structure and dynamics.
- Metadata and dataset citation provided: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018.

## Sampling design and locations
- Water samples collected at 3 locations in Durleigh Reservoir.
  - Location coordinates: 
    - Location 1: 51.1213, -3.0400
    - Location 2: 51.1210, -3.0403
    - Location 3: 51.1215, -3.0445
- All locations accessed by boat.
- On 5 April 2018, Location 3 was inaccessible; no data for that date at Location 3.
- At each location, samples were taken at three depths:
  - L1S (surface), L1M (middle), L1B (bottom of water column).
- Depths are recorded in metres.
- Date format used: dd/mm/yyyy.

## Methods and processing
- Sampling conducted following Wessex Water protocol.
- Samples collected by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain in 2018.
- Processing and analysis performed by Emily Slavin at Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
- Sample concentration by membrane filtration prior to identification and enumeration.
- Enumeration performed with an Olympus BH2 light microscope.
- A minimum of 30 fields of view counted per sample.

## Data content and structure
- Counts reported as cells per millilitre (cells/ml).
- Phytoplankton community structure categories reported:
  - Cyanobacteria (BGA; blue-green algae)
  - Greens
  - Diatoms
  - Others
- In addition to community-level counts, counts for specific phytoplankton species are provided.
- Outputs include total phytoplankton counts per sample and species-specific counts.

## Data quality and presentation
- Multiple sampling depths and locations provide a multi-dimensional view of phytoplankton.
- Metadata include date, location coordinates, and depth identifiers (L1S, L1M, L1B).
- Noted data gap: Location 3 missing data on 5 April 2018 due to inaccessibility.
- Clear citation for data usage: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018.

## Potential uses for data support
- Enable end users to explore phytoplankton dynamics across locations and depths.
- Support cross-site comparisons and reservoir health assessments.
- Integrate with broader water quality datasets for dashboards or reports.
- Verify data quality and transform into user-friendly data products (e.g., charts by location/depth and time).
- Promote data reuse through clear provenance and methodological details.
