# Water chemistry samples from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Overview
- Dataset documenting water chemistry samples taken at Durleigh Reservoir in 2018 to assess in-reservoir water quality.
- Sampling used Van dorn water samplers following Wessex Water protocols for metals, inorganics, T&O metabolites, and BOD.
- Collected by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain; processed at Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
- Some parameters not reported when laboratory processing frequency increased.
- Concentrations reported as <0.02 where below detection limits.

## Spatial and temporal coverage
- Sampling period: 22 February 2018 to 5 October 2018.
- Location coordinates (three sampling sites):
  - Location 1: lat 51.1213, lon -3.0400
  - Location 2: lat 51.1210, lon -3.0403
  - Location 3: lat 51.1215, lon -3.0445
- Date format: dd-mmm-yyyy; Time format: HH:MM.

## Sampling design
- Depths sampled at each location: surface (L1S), middle (L1M), bottom (L1B); depths vary with changing reservoir water level.
- All locations accessed by boat.
- On 5 April 2018, Location 3 was inaccessible; no values for that date.

## Parameters and analytical methods
- Measured parameters (units indicated where applicable): 
  - Suspended solids
  - Turbidity (NTU) – Turbidimeter
  - Conductivity
  - pH
  - Alkalinity
  - Ammonia (mg/l)
  - TON (mg/l) – method with nitrate reduction
  - Nitrite (mg/l) – colorimetric method
  - Nitrate (mg/l) – TON/Nitrate method
  - Ammonium (mg/l) – sodium nitroferricyanide method
  - Orthophosphate (mg/l) – ascorbic acid method
  - Sulphate (mg/l)
  - Chloride (mg/l)

  - Sodium (mg/l)
  - Magnesium (mg/l)
  - Aluminium (total and soluble) (mg/l)
  - Potassium (mg/l)
  - Calcium (mg/l)
  - Manganese (total and soluble) (mg/l) – ICP-MS
  - Iron (total and soluble) (mg/l) – ICP-MS
  - Copper (total and soluble) (mg/l)
  - Zinc (total and soluble) (mg/l)
  - Geosmin – GC/MS/MS (total) (ng/l)
  - MIB – GC/MS/MS (ng/l)
- Geosmin and MIB: extraction via solid phase extraction; eluted with dichloromethane.
- Calibration standards, analytical quality control (QC), and blanks processed alongside samples.

## Quality and limitations
- Some parameters not reported when laboratory processing frequency increased.
- Detection limit: concentrations reported as <0.02 (below detection limit).
- BOD measurements (5-day, 20°C) were performed only at Surface and Bottom of Location 1 on 21/22/23 August 2018.
