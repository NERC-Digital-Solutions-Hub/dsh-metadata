# Water chemistry samples from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Aim and scope
- 2018 in-reservoir water quality monitoring dataset for Durleigh Reservoir.
- Samples collected to assess water quality across multiple locations and depths over time.
- Some parameters not reported when processing frequency at the Wessex Water laboratory increased.

## Sampling locations and timing
- Sampling at 3 locations in Durleigh Reservoir:
  - Location 1: lat 51.1213, lon -3.0400
  - Location 2: lat 51.1210, lon -3.0403
  - Location 3: lat 51.1215, lon -3.0445
- All locations accessed by boat.
- Sampling dates: 22 February 2018 to 5 October 2018.
- On 5 April 2018, Location 3 was inaccessible; no data for that date at Location 3.
- At each location, three depths sampled (surface, middle, bottom) denoting L1S, L1M, L1B (depths varied with water level).

## Sampling and analytical methods
- Samplers: Van Dorn Water sampler, following Wessex Water protocol for metals, inorganics, T&O metabolites, and BOD.
- Processing: Samples processed at the Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
- Depth-related sampling: Depth designation L1S (surface), L1M (middle), L1B (bottom).
- Instruments and procedures:
  - Turbidity (NTU) measured with turbidimeter.
  - Geosmin and MIB analyzed by GC/MS/MS (total) after solid-phase extraction (SPE); eluted with dichloromethane.
  - Other metals and ions measured by standard methods; ICP-MS used for total/soluble Mn, Fe.
  - Calibration standards, analytical quality control, and blanks run with test samples.
- Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD): 5-day incubation at 20°C (mg O2/L); measured only at the surface and bottom of Location 1 on 21/22/23 August 2018.

## Parameters and data format
- Physical/chemical parameters (units where applicable):
  - Suspended solids
  - Turbidity (NTU)
  - Conductivity
  - pH
  - Alkalinity

  - TON (mg/L) – nitrite reduced method
  - Nitrite (mg/L)
  - Nitrate (mg/L) – TON/NITRITE relation
  - Ammonium (mg/L)
  - Orthophosphate (mg/L)
  - Sulphate (mg/L)
  - Chloride (mg/L)
  - Silica (mg/L)
  - Temperature (°C)

  - Magnesium (mg/L)
  - Aluminium (total and soluble) (mg/L)
  - Potassium (mg/L)
  - Calcium (mg/L)
  - Manganese (total and soluble) (mg/L) – ICP-MS
  - Iron (total and soluble) (mg/L) – ICP-MS
  - Copper (total and soluble) (mg/L)
  - Zinc (total and soluble) (mg/L)
  - Geosmin (ng/L) – GC/MS/MS
  - MIB (ng/L) – GC/MS/MS
- Concentrations reported as "<0.02" where below detection limits.
- Depth- and location-specific data collected as L1S, L1M, L1B per sampling event.

## Data quality and caveats
- Some parameters were not reported when laboratory processing frequency increased.
- Data include QA measures: calibration standards, QA samples, and blanks processed alongside test samples.
- One location (Location 3) had missing data on 5 April 2018 due to inaccessibility.
