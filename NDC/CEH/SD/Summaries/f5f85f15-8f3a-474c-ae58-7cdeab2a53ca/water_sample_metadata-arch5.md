# Water chemistry samples from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Overview
- Purpose: 2018 assessment of in-reservoir water quality.
- Sampling window: 22 February 2018 to 5 October 2018.
- Locations: three sites with coordinates:
  - Location 1: 51.1213, -3.0400
  - Location 2: 51.1210, -3.0403
  - Location 3: 51.1215, -3.0445
- Access: all sites by boat; Location 3 inaccessible on 5 April 2018 (no data for that date).
- Depths: at each site, three depths (surface, middle, bottom) labeled as L1S, L1M, L1B (example: L1M = middle at location 1).
- Sampling protocol: Van Dorn water sampler following Wessex Water protocol for metals, inorganics, T&O metabolites, and BOD.
- Collectors and processing: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain; processed at the Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
- Data reporting: some parameters not reported when laboratory processing frequency increased.

## Data content and parameters
- Analytes and measurements include:
  - Suspended solids, Turbidity (NTU), Conductivity, pH, Alkalinity
  - Ammonia, TON, Nitrite, Nitrate, Ammonium
  - Orthophosphate, Sulphate, Chloride, Silica
  - Temperature, Sodium, Magnesium, Aluminium (total and soluble)
  - Potassium, Calcium, Manganese (total and soluble), Iron (total and soluble)
  - Copper (total and soluble), Zinc (total and soluble)
  - Geosmin, MIB
  - Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) at 5 days
- Units: mg/l for most parameters; NTU for turbidity; Geosmin/MIB in ng/l; BOD in mg O2/l.
- Depth/Location coding: L1S/L1M/L1B denote depth per location (e.g., L1M = middle at location 1).
- Methods:
  - Metals and ions via ICP-MS (where applicable)
  - Geosmin and MIB via GC/MS/MS; extractions by solid-phase extraction with dichloromethane elution
  - BOD via 5-day incubation at 20°C
- Data quality indicators:
  - Values reported as <0.02 indicating level of detection
  - Calibration standards, QA controls, and blanks run alongside samples

## Data quality, provenance, and notes
- Processing: some parameters not reported when Wessex Water laboratory processing frequency increased.
- QA/QC: calibration standards, analytical QA controls, and blanks are included in analyses.
- Provenance: dataset credited to Slavin, E.I. and Wain, D.J. (2018); processing at Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.

## Data governance and sharing considerations for Data Stewards
- Data completeness and gaps: notable gap on 5 April 2018 for Location 3; some parameters omitted due to lab frequency changes.
- Metadata needs: ensure complete fields for date/time formats (dd-mmm-yyyy; HH:MM), geographic coordinates, depth codes (L1S/L1M/L1B), site labeling, methods, units, detection limits, QA/QC details, and provenance.
- Standardization: maintain consistent naming for depths and locations; harmonize units and reporting conventions (e.g., <0.02 LOD, ng/l for Geosmin/MIB).
- Accessibility: plan for uploading to relevant portals and catalogues; include the dataset citation Slavin & Wain (2018).
- Documentation: include notes on data limitations, incomplete dates, and any bespoke processing to aid re-use and governance.
