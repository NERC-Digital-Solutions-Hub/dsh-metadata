# Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Overview
- Dataset of phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir collected in 2018 (22 February to 5 October 2018).
- Aimed at understanding phytoplankton dynamics within the reservoir.

## Data content
- Sampling locations: three locations with coordinates:
  - Location 1: 51.1213, -3.0400
  - Location 2: 51.1210, -3.0403
  - Location 3: 51.1215, -3.0445
- At each location, samples were taken at three depths: surface (L1S), middle (L1M), bottom (L1B).
- Depths are in metres; counts are in cells/ml.
- On 5 April 2018, Location 3 was inaccessible, resulting in missing values for that date.
- Outputs include total phytoplankton cell counts and species-specific counts; phytoplankton community structure categories reported as cyanobacteria (BGA), greens, diatoms, and others.

## Sampling and processing
- Water samples collected using a van Dorn sampler following Wessex Water sampling protocol.
- Collected by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain; processed and analysed by Emily Slavin (Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford).
- Concentration by membrane filtration; enumeration via Olympus BH2 light microscope.
- A minimum of 30 fields of view counted per sample.

## Metadata and provenance
- Date format: dd/mm/yyyy.
- Dataset citation: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018.
- Clear documentation of collection and analysis workflow (collectors, laboratory, equipment).

## Data quality and limitations
- Geographic and temporal gaps due to inaccessibility (Location 3 on 5 April 2018).
- Standardized units (cells/ml) and defined sampling depths improve consistency and reuse.
- Metadata includes precise coordinates, dates, and depth identifiers (L1S, L1M, L1B) for validation and discoverability.

## Usage and implications for data strategy
- Provides a well-documented data product suitable for ecosystem monitoring and comparative analyses.
- Facilitates data stewardship through explicit provenance, quality indicators, and a formal citation.
- Supports planning for data discovery, interoperability, and potential integration with broader reservoir monitoring datasets.
