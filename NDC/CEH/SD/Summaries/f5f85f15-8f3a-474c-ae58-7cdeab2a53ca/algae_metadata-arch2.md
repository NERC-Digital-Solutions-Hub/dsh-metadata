# Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Overview
- Dataset of phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir collected during 2018 (22/02/2018 to 05/10/2018).
- Outputs include total phytoplankton counts (cells/ml) and counts for specific taxa; community structure categorized as cyanobacteria (BGA), greens, diatoms, and others.
- Sampled and processed to understand phytoplankton dynamics and reservoir health.

## Sampling locations and depths
- Three sampling locations at Durleigh Reservoir with coordinates:
  - Location 1: lat 51.1213, lon -3.0400
  - Location 2: lat 51.1210, lon -3.0403
  - Location 3: lat 51.1215, lon -3.0445
- All locations accessed by boat; on 5 April 2018 Location 3 was inaccessible, so no data for that date.
- At each location, three depths were sampled:
  - L1S (surface), L1M (middle), L1B (bottom)
  - Depth labels refer to sampling at Location 1 as example (L1M = middle of the water column at Location 1); depths are given in metres.

## Sampling methodology
- Water samples collected with a van Dorn sampler following Wessex Water sampling protocol.
- Dates of sampling span 2018; sampled by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.

## Laboratory analysis
- Concentration of samples performed by membrane filtration.
- Enumeration conducted using an Olympus BH2 light microscope.
- A minimum of 30 fields of view counted per sample.
- Output includes total phytoplankton cell counts and counts for specific species.

## Data structure and provenance
- Metadata and results include date (dd/mm/yyyy), locations, depth labels (L1S/L1M/L1B), and geographic coordinates; counts reported in cells/ml.
- Phytoplankton community structure reported as cyanobacteria (BGA), greens, diatoms, and others.
- Samples processed by Emily Slavin at Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
- Dataset citation: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018.

## Use, quality, and storage considerations
- Aimed at enabling consistent monitoring of environmental health and informing policy performance over time.
- Methods are standardized to support data quality assurance, with clear documentation of sampling, processing, and data outputs.
- As with similar monitoring datasets, there is a potential gap on 5 April 2018 for Location 3 due to inaccessibility.
- Data are prepared for storage and upload to appropriate data portals as part of routine stewardship.
