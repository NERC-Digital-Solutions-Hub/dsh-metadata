# Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Overview
- Metadata describing phytoplankton cell counts collected from Durleigh Reservoir in 2018.
- Timeframe: samples collected between 22 February 2018 and 05 October 2018.
- Location: three sampling locations at Durleigh Reservoir; all locations accessed by boat.
- Measurements: total phytoplankton cell counts per sample (cells/ml) and counts for specific groups/species.
- Depths: at each location, samples collected from surface (L1S), middle (L1M), and bottom (L1B) of the water column.
- Community structure categories: cyanobacteria (BGA), greens, diatoms, and others.
- Data producers and processors are named; dataset should be cited accordingly.

## Data collection and scope
- Sampling method: van Dorn water sampler following Wessex Water sampling protocol.
- Date format: dd/mm/yyyy.
- Sampling locations and coordinates:
  - Location 1: lat 51.1213, lon -3.0400
  - Location 2: lat 51.1210, lon -3.0403
  - Location 3: lat 51.1215, lon -3.0445
- All locations were accessed by boat.
- Data Gap: on 5 April 2018, location 3 was inaccessible, so no values for that date.
- Responsible researchers: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain collected samples in 2018; processing done by Emily Slavin at Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.

## Sampling design and methods
- Depths sampled per location: surface (L1S), middle (L1M), bottom (L1B); depth units in metres.
- Sample processing: concentration by membrane filtration; enumeration/identification via Olympus BH2 light microscope.
- Quality control: a minimum of 30 fields of view counted per sample.

## Data content and structure
- Outputs include:
  - Total phytoplankton cell counts per sample (cells/ml).
  - Counts for specific species.
  - Phytoplankton community composition by group: cyanobacteria (BGA), greens, diatoms, others.
- Data provenance: collected by named researchers; analyzed/processed at a named laboratory.

## Data quality and governance
- Clear documentation of sampling protocol, locations, and dates supports reproducibility and reuse.
- Standardized format notes: date format and depth labeling (L1S, L1M, L1B) facilitate consistent interpretation.
- Explicit methodology for counting (minimum 30 fields of view) provides a baseline for quality and comparability.

## Metadata, citation, and provenance
- Dataset citation: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Phytoplankton cell counts from Durleigh Reservoir 2018.
- Metadata file purpose: to describe collection, processing, and structure to enable discovery and reuse.

## Access, sharing, and stewardship considerations
- Data is documented with collection times, locations, depths, methods, and processing details to aid data stewardship and discoverability.
- Ensure ongoing updates and accessibility align with organisational data governance practices.
- When sharing, include the full citation and the detailed metadata described above to preserve context and reuse potential.
