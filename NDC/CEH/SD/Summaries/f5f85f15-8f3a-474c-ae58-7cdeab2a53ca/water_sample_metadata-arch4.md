# Water chemistry samples from Durleigh Reservoir 2018

## Overview
- Metadata for an in-reservoir water chemistry dataset from Durleigh Reservoir, collected in 2018.
- Aims to assess water quality across locations, depths, and time to support understanding of in-reservoir conditions.

## Sampling design and scope
- Sampling period: 22 February 2018 to 5 October 2018.
- Locations: three sampling points in Durleigh Reservoir.
  - Location 1: lat 51.1213, lon -3.0400
  - Location 2: lat 51.1210, lon -3.0403
  - Location 3: lat 51.1215, lon -3.0445
- Access: all locations accessed by boat.
- Depths: at each location, samples collected from surface, middle, and bottom (L1S, L1M, L1B); depths vary with changing water level.
- Data gap: location 3 was inaccessible on 5 April 2018, so no values for that date.

## Sampling and processing methods
- Collection method: Van Dorn water sampler following Wessex Water protocol for metals, inorganics, T&O metabolites, and BOD.
- Processing: samples processed at Wessex Water Scientific Centre, Saltford.
- Personnel: collected by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
- Quality controls: calibration standards, analytical quality control, and blank samples analyzed alongside test samples.
- Reporting conventions: concentrations reported as <0.02 to indicate limit of detection; some parameters not reported when laboratory processing frequency changed.

## Parameters measured and analytical details
- Physical and general water quality:
  - Suspended solids
  - Turbidity (NTU) – Turbidimeter
  - Conductivity
  - Temperature (degrees C)
  - pH
  - Alkalinity
- Nutrients and inorganic species (all reported in mg/l unless noted):
  - Ammonia
  - TON (N-1-napthylethylene-diamine dihydrochloride method with nitrate reduced)
  - Nitrite
  - Nitrate (TON concentration – nitrite concentration)
  - Ammonium
  - Orthophosphate (ascorbic acid method)
  - Sulphate
  - Chloride
  - Silica
  - Sodium
  - Magnesium
  - Aluminium (total and soluble)
  - Potassium
  - Calcium
  - Manganese (total and soluble) – ICP-MS
  - Iron (total and soluble) – ICP-MS
  - Copper (total and soluble) – ICP-MS
  - Zinc (total and soluble) – ICP-MS
- Volatile/odour compounds:
  - Geosmin – GC/MS/MS (total, ng/l); extraction via solid phase extraction; eluted with dichloromethane
  - MIB (2-MIB) – GC/MS/MS (ng/l); extraction via solid phase extraction; eluted with dichloromethane
- Biological/organic parameter:
  - Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD7) – 5 days at 20°C (mg O2/l); measured only at surface and bottom of Location 1 on 21/22/23 August 2018

## Data quality, gaps, and caveats
- Some parameters not reported when Wessex lab processing frequency increased.
- Detection limits: concentrations below 0.02 are recorded as <0.02.
- Date/time format: dates as dd-mmm-yyyy; times in 24-hour HH:MM.
- Data gaps: incomplete data for Location 3 on 5 April 2018; occasional missing values due to processing frequency.
