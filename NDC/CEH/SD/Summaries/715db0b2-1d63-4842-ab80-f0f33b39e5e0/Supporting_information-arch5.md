# SusHiWat_FinalVersion.WEAP

## Overview
- Dataset comprises the project folder SusHiWat_FinalVersion.WEAP for the WEAP water resources model, including all files needed to run the model for a historical period and to explore multiple future climate-change scenarios.
- Built within the SusHi-Wat project (NE/N015541/1), funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council and the Indian Ministry of Earth Sciences through the Newton-Bhabha Fund.

## Contents
- WEAP model project folder with a sub-folder named Data.
- Data sub-folder includes:
  - Meteorological inputs for the model (11 CSV files).
  - Numerous WEAP-supporting files (e.g., databases, shapefiles, images, text/config files, and various other formats such as DBF, PX, X02–XG4, Y02–YG4, etc.).
- The structure is designed to run the model for a historical period and to supply inputs for multiple future climate-change scenarios.

## Running for the historical period
- Open WEAP and go to Area > Manage Areas.
- Use Restore to load SusHiWat_FinalVersion.WEAP, creating a new folder SusHiWat_FinalVersion in the WEAP Areas directory (default under Documents when WEAP is installed).
- Switch to Results view to obtain outputs for the period June 1989 – May 2008.

## Running future climate-change scenarios
- Available scenarios are generated by combining RCPs with GCMs from CMIP5, using KNMI Climate Explorer; time slices are MidCentury (2031–2050) and EndCentury (2081–2100).
- To run a specific scenario, update model inputs related to precipitation, temperature, glacier area, and initial depth:
  - Replace precipitation and temperature inputs using scenario-specific files (Pcorrected_WEAPEBands.csv, Pcorrected_WEAPEBands_day.csv, Tcorrected_WEAPEBands.csv, Tmaxcorrected_WEAPEBands_day.csv, Tmincorrected_WEAPEBands_day.csv) from the Climate Change Scenarios data.
  - In WEAP, under Data > Demand Sites and Catchments > Land use > Area, adjust glacier area for elements C04, C07, C08, C09, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, C17, C18, C19, C20 using TimeSlice_GlacierProjection_CXX.csv for the chosen scenario.
  - Still in Data, adjust Glacier initial ice depth for the same elements using the corresponding TimeSlice_GlacierProjection_CXX.csv.
- Run the model in Results to obtain outputs, which correspond to 2031–2050 or 2081–2100 depending on the scenario; baseline dates do not change.

## Provenance and funding
- Linked to the SusHi-Wat project (NE/N015541/1) funded by NERC and the Indian Ministry of Earth Sciences.

## Data governance and stewardship considerations
- Metadata and provenance: ensure clear documentation of model version, input files, scenario mappings, data sources, and the relationship between scenario files and WEAP inputs.
- Data quality and interoperability: manage the wide variety of file types and formats; maintain consistency between scenario inputs and glacier projection files.
- Access, storage, and updates: store the complete WEAP project with the Data sub-folder; implement versioning for updated climate scenarios and corresponding input files.
- Usage guidance: provide explicit instructions for restoring the WEAP project, running historical simulations, and configuring future scenarios to support discoverability and reuse.
- Licensing and reuse terms: specify licensing or terms of use to govern sharing and reuse of the dataset.
