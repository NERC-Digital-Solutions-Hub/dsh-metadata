# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: Maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. The policy covers survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- Current CS partners:
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- These elements are essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest defense: requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

Circumstances for location release and precision
- Access can identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Precise six-digit grid references are only released when essential and only after CEH pre-processing to avoid direct release; VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases may allow external release under licence if the requester proves the related IP requires equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) can potentially identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals for approved purposes.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other obligations after licence expires.
- Licensees must confirm in writing after the project that data remained secure and were destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; if in doubt, consult CEH.
- Location data must not be used to visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have licensing terms similar to six-digit releases but do not require the same high IP confidentiality criteria.
- A clause prevents licensees from trying to identify square locations or claiming to have done so.

Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, with clauses reflecting policy; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI/Environmental Regulations procedures to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing within reasonable timeframes; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may vary by collaboration or payment arrangements.
