# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview (scope and purpose)
- Provides guidelines for field data collection in CS2000, expanding on CS1990.
- Aims to monitor environmental health and landscape change over time using standardized datasets.
- Emphasizes consistent data capture, integration with field maps, and linkages to policy/research context.
- Data collection supports vegetation, land cover, boundaries, soils, and freshwater interfaces across GB.

## Flora and habitat coding (field data recording)
- Comprehensive species coding system for: 
  - Ferns (e.g., Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris filix-mmas) and associated abbreviations.
  - Forbs/woody species with standardized abbreviations (e.g., Acer pseudosal) and cross-references to scientific names.
  - Mosses/Lichens with separate coding blocks and typologies.
- Codes map to field observations on Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and are used for standardized habitat classification and policy-relevant outputs.
- Broad Habitat and plot-level categorisations tied to policy frameworks (e.g., UK Biodiversity Action Plans).

## Data collection tools and formats
- Field Assessment Books (FABs) structure data collection across multiple domains:
  - Mapping, plots (vegetation data), and sampling sections.
  - Ownership, physiography, inland water, coastal features, agriculture, forestry, boundaries, buildings/communications/recreation, and universal codes.
- Standardized procedures ensure consistency across observers and time-series analyses.
- Mapping outputs include de novo mapping for new squares and change detection for existing squares; results feed into policy-relevant habitat metrics.

## Sampling framework and logistics
- Three sampling types in CS2000:
  - Soil sampling (by field surveyors)
  - Calluna sampling (by field surveyors)
  - Freshwater biota sampling (by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff)
- Soil sampling objectives:
  - Five replicate soil samples per square (in each X-plot), focusing on soil chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status.
  - Samples processed at ITE Merlewood; rapid processing required for short-shelf-life components.
- Calluna sampling:
  - Collect current year's growth (CYG) shoots from Calluna vulgaris; random sampling across plants.
  - Samples despatched to ITE Merlewood; options to ship via research stations or direct post.
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Coordinated with IFE; conducted concurrently with field surveys to avoid interference.
- Equipment and distribution:
  - Specific items allocated to teams; includes cool boxes, trowels, pipes, envelopes, and labeled bags for soil cores.
  - Detailed packing and dispatch instructions to ensure traceability and sample integrity.

## Sampling procedures (soil and Calluna)
- Center-plot sampling within each X-plot:
  - First soil core: long black pipe (15 cm) positioned 15 cm north of the center plot corner.
  - Second and third soil cores: short white pipes (8 cm) positioned 15 cm east and 15 cm west of the first point.
  - Soil cores placed in labeled bags, shipped to ITE Merlewood; remaining cores stored in the car until pickup.
- Calluna sampling steps:
  - Label bags with sample details; collect 30–50 g of current-year growth; seal and post as required.
  - Drying guidance provided if samples are wet; ensure proper packaging and postage receipts for reimbursement.
- Documentation:
  - All sampling details logged on FABs; notes appended for any deviations or site-specific comments.

## Freshwater sampling coordination
- Recognizes potential concurrent work by IFE staff.
- Coordination with CS2000 coordinators to arrange suitable timing to minimize disruption and ensure data compatibility.

## Photography and documentation
- Each team receives a camera; photos are taken for every vegetation plot to capture general appearance and landmark references.
- Reference features should be obvious, unique, permanent, and visible in future visits.
- Photos must label square/plot numbers clearly on a provided board within the frame.
- Composition guidelines emphasize plot-centric framing with minimal sky to ensure useful light/landmark context.

## Procedures after survey
- A day’s data must be reviewed to ensure no features are omitted.
- Re-transcribing data onto new forms is discouraged and reserved for damage/spoilage scenarios.
- FABs and samples should be transported to ITE stations promptly.

## Annex 1: Collecting GPS data
- Step-by-step GPS usage and troubleshooting:
  - Ensure sufficient satellites (minimum four) and monitor PDOP (ideally below 6 for 3D fixes).
  - Record stationary positions (plots) and moving features (boundaries) with appropriate file names.
  - Use custom file naming: square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE) or feature-based names (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
  - Data logging displays and controls (start/stop logging, time stamps) are described in detail.
- Battery management, almanac updates, and obstruction handling guidance provided.
- Tips for using the Magellan keypad and achieving unobstructed sky views to improve GPS accuracy.

## Attribute reference and mapping aids
- Attribute reference sheets help quickly select plot identifiers and feature IDs to streamline field coding.
- Sheets provide mappings between shorthand plot IDs and full FAB coding templates for efficient data entry.
