# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Aim to maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners include CEH (on behalf of NERC) and Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

- Rationale for confidentiality
  - Protects representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and landowner permission to survey.
  - Public-interest justification; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Release conditions and precision levels
  - Access can indicate whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to identify the broader location.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances under licence; CEH may preprocess data to avoid release.
  - Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality and may be released under the same exceptional terms.
  - Any release must avoid enabling precise location identification beyond permitted terms.

- Licensing terms and conditions
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
  - Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the period.
  - Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
  - Data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to monitor landowner compliance.
  - Evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP may be required.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
  - Licences for four-digit or spatial data include clauses prohibiting attempts to deduce precise square locations or to claim such derivations.

- Roles and responsibilities
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences.
  - Licences must be signed by a senior authority from the licensee organization.
  - If approval is denied, CEH will follow legal procedures under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report summarising licence applications and decision grounds.
  - CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analysis within reasonable timeframes; other requests are case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid as negotiated.
