# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- QA exercise to measure consistency and reliability of CS2000 field work.
- Scope: 38 of 519 squares; resurvey of 234 species plots across nine plot types.
- Focus areas: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, reliability of percentage vegetation cover estimates, potential directional bias in CS2000 outputs, comparability with CS1990, landcover mapping accuracy, and recording of changes.

## Aims
- Quantify accuracy of field recording in CS2000 and assess change statistics.
- Examine plot relocation efficiency and sources of error (observer bias, location/orientation, plot type, management, season).
- Relate findings to CS1990 performance.
- Evaluate accuracy of landcover mapping and recording of changes.

## Methods and Scope
- Sample: 38 squares (of 519); one quarter resurveyed; 234 plots across main plot types (quadrats and linear plots; road verges; streamsides; boundaries; arable margins).
- Plot relocation: attempt to relocate buried plates from 1990; assess plate and plot recovery eight years on.
- Data comparisons: CS2000 survey records vs QA reassessment (T1 vs T2) across species, cover, landcover codes, boundary features, and change strings.
- Categorization of relocation success:
  - I. Plate and plot located
  - II. Plate not found but plot closely matches
  - III. Plate not found; approximate relocation
  - IV. Insufficient data to locate; plot abandoned
- Annex B (dates and efficiency) indicates re-survey and QA timing and coverage.

## Key Results

### Plot Relocation and Plate Recovery
- CS2000 relocation success: about 60% accurately relocated; ~25% relocated approximately; ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate recovery by QA assessors: 69.3% success; comparable to 1991 QA of CS1990 (65.2%).
- Overall: 8-year post-burial relocation feasibility similar to 12-month post-burial results.
- Total CS2000 plate/plot recovery across all assessments indicates substantial but imperfect relocation; some issues included mis-locations relative to boundaries or hedges and occasional use of new plates, complicating next-cohort relocations.

### Species Concordance and Recording Accuracy
- Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4; overall species concordance between CS2000 and QA high (approximately 87–88% per-plot averages).
- Non-concurrences largely due to plot location/orientation errors and mis-recorded or overlooked species; in-depth analysis partitions errors into mis-identifications, mis-location/orientation, and overlooked species.
- The QA identified that improvements in plot relocation and location consistency reduce apparent species mis-matches, with overall efficiency comparable to CS1990 QA once location issues are accounted for.

### Vegetation Cover (Percent Cover) and Codes
- Agreement on cover values generally high but with notable species-specific differences:
  - Some species show statistically significant differences in cover between CS2000 and QA (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum) in certain comparisons.
  - Overall, cover codes exhibited substantial concordance; for landuse sample points, coverage agreement around 63%, with higher concordance (about 74%) for select well-identified species.
- Differences often tied to season, plot location/orientation, or assessors' interpretation of cover bands.

### Change in Frequency and Structure
- DECORANA axis analysis shows no directional bias when aggregating quadrats by plot type; mean axis scores CS2000 vs QA are very close (no significant difference).
- Overall change concurrence (alignment of two time-points) about 51.4%; some changes noted by CS2000 but not substantiated by QA (33.9%); and changes recorded but not observed by CS2000 (14.7%).
- Indicates substantial challenges in consistently detecting and recording changes over time; many changes may be missed or misinterpreted without rigorous field verification and coding.

### Landcover Mapping and Boundary Features
- Primary landcover codes:
  - Overall concordance excluding BAP codes: 91.6%
  - BAP (broad habitat) concordance: 77.4%
  - Including BAP codes: overall primary land cover agreement about 87.5%
- Primary boundary features:
  - Total concordance: 85.0% (code concordance 92.0%)
  - Hedge boundary coding (e.g., 323 mixed hedge) and occasional updates reflecting changes not captured in 1990 strings noted as common discrepancies.
- Boundary detail (height, stockproof status) showed high agreement (boundary height 89.2%; stockproof 83.8%; code concordance around 92.8% and 89.4%, respectively).

### Hedge Diversity and Arable Margin Plots
- Hedge diversity (19 samples): total species recorded 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
- Arable margin plots: only five plots; concordance was very low (about 30.6%), with many misidentifications and seasonal effects contributing to poor reliability. Recommendations cautioning two visits per plot for future arable margins.

## Implications for Data Quality and Monitoring
- Overall CS2000 field data collection demonstrates high reliability in relocation, landcover coding, and boundary mapping, with strong concordance to QA assessments across many elements.
- Change detection remains a weak point; a substantial proportion of real changes may be missed or misclassified without improved procedures, suggesting a need for:
  - More consistent plot location/orientation checks
  - Clearer coding and documentation for changes
  - Additional visits or seasonal timing considerations for certain plot types (e.g., arable margins)
- Mapping components (primary codes and boundaries) show robust agreement, supporting their use in longitudinal environmental health and policy monitoring.
- Data integration opportunities exist due to generally high data quality, but analysts should be aware of potential biases from mis-location, mis-identifications, and seasonal effects, especially for certain taxa and plot types.

## Summary for Monitoring and Analysis
- CS2000 QA indicates reliable data collection across relocation, species presence, and landcover coding, enabling credible long-term environmental monitoring.
- Caution is warranted for change statistics and arable margin plots; these areas may require targeted QA enhancements or supplementary field checks.
- The QA framework demonstrates effective methods for validating large-scale environmental monitoring datasets and can inform ongoing data quality assurance processes for environmental health indicators.
