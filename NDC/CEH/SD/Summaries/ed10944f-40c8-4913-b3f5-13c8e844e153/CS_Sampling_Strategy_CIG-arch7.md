# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field work from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes that the methodology is tightly linked to time-series analysis and is essential for deriving national and regional habitat estimates.
- Highlights the shift from ecological features to landscape, land-use, and habitat mapping across surveys.
- Notes that the framework underpins map-based data products and policy-relevant reporting at multiple geographic scales (GB, England & Wales, Scotland, Wales-only).

## Core Concepts
- Stratified random sampling to reduce bias and ensure representative sampling across ecological variation.
- ITE Land Classification as the stratification system; classifying land into distinct environmental types to guide sample placement.
- Use of 1 km square sample units (with initial center squares in a 15 x 15 km grid) for national-scale sampling.
- Historical constraint: limited computing power early on led to using a central subset of squares; later revisions expanded to classify all squares with surrogates while maintaining class characteristics.
- National estimates initially derived from class-area proportions multiplied by mean habitat area per class within each class.

## Timeline of Sampling Frameworks

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification (32 classes)
  - 1228 centre 1 km squares classified; 4 surrounding squares per centre also classified (total ~6,039 km squares).
  - 256 squares surveyed (8 per class) for field data (vegetation and soils).
  - National estimates calculated from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class times the Land Class area.

- 1984 – 2nd Field Survey
  - 12 squares surveyed per land class (384 total; plus the 8 previously visited per class).
  - Continued use of 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990)
  - A revised framework to classify every GB 1 km square; urban and sea corrections added.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats plus 1984 survey features.
  - Publication of Countryside Survey 1990 main report (CS1990).

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification (CS1990 update)
  - Land Classification expanded to allow separate reporting for Scotland; number of Land Classes increased to 40.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey CS2000 Developments
  - Addressed policy-driven needs for separate England & Wales and Scotland estimates.
  - Class sub-division into country-unit versions, class aggregation where under-represented, and additional squares to ensure adequate representation (total 40 strata expanded to 40+ with country-unit refinements to 45 strata).
  - Introduction of separate upland habitat estimates through an additional module.
  - Wales received extra Welsh-class squares; England did not receive equivalent increases in all classes.
  - Notable output: revised class maps for “England with Wales” and Scotland; comprehensive tables of square counts and sampling rates.

- 2007 – Developments for Wales-only Reporting (CS2007)
  - Welsh reporting required finer Wales-only stratification; added five country-unit subdivisions: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w (increasing to 45 strata).
  - Added 43 Welsh squares to meet representation needs (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class); England had some classes with as few as 4 squares.
  - Updated class maps and sample-square distributions to accommodate Wales-focused reporting while maintaining overall GB estimates.

## Classification and Stratification Details
- Land Classes evolved from 32 (1978) to 40 (1990), then to 45 (2000/2007) with country-unit subdivisions for England, Wales, and Scotland.
- In CS2000 and CS2007, classes were subdivided into country-specific variants (e.g., 5w, 6w, etc.) to enable country-level estimates.
- Adjustments included class aggregation where needed to preserve statistical representation within each country unit.
- Separate upland habitat sampling was added to improve accuracy for upland estimations.

## Country-Specific Sampling and Estimates
- Early cross-border classifications mixed country boundaries; later frameworks restructured sampling to enable England & Wales and Scotland-specific estimates.
- Country estimates calculated from mean features per class multiplied by the class area within each country unit.
- Tables and maps illustrate how squares are distributed across countries and classes; notes highlight the trade-offs between cross-country consistency and country-specific reporting.

## Uplands Module
- An additional sampling module added in CS2000 funded to improve habitat estimates in uplands and marginal uplands of England and Wales.
- Ensures better statistical accuracy for country-based upland habitat reporting.

## Data Outputs and GIS Relevance
- Land Classification maps and class-based sampling schemes underpin map-based data products and GIS visualizations.
- Time-series capability supports analysis of habitat extent and change across survey years.
- Documentation provides a foundation for reproducible GIS workflows and policy-relevant spatial reporting at GB, England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only levels.
