# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Aim and scope
- Evaluates consistency and reliability of the Countryside 2000 field programme due to many recorders.
- Key QA components: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, reliability of percentage cover estimates, potential directional bias in habitat change, and comparability with CS1990.
- Focuses on 38 of 519 squares surveyed in 1998, with one quarter resurveyed across 234 species plots in nine plot types.

## Methods and scope
- Resurvey design: one quarter of each selected square; plots analyzed across quadrats and linear plots (road verges, streamsides, boundaries, and additional plots).
- Plate and plot relocation: assessment of ability to relocate buried plates and plots after eight years; comparison with 1991 QA of CS1990.
- Data types examined: land cover mapping, boundary features, vegetation species and cover, and recorded changes since 1990.
- Coding framework: primary land cover codes, secondary/descriptive codes, and cover codes; annexed protocols for mapping and boundary coding.

## Key findings

### Plot relocation
- Recovery rate: 86.7% of 210 plots relocated satisfactorily; similar to 1991 QA results.
- Exact relocation: CS2000 surveyors accurately relocated about 60% of 1990 plots; ~25% relocated closely; ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate relocation: assessors located 69.3% of plates; overall plate/plot recovery rate around 40–45% for CS2000 (compared with 59.4% upper bound).
- Eight-year relocation: indicates that relocation remains feasible but with notable planning and effort; some misplacement between plot features (e.g., wrong boundary side, wrong bank of a stream).

### Species concordance
- Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4 (increase of about 2.5 species on reassessment).
- Overall concordance: about 87.7% across all plots; differences largely due to plot location/orientation errors and seasonal effects.
- Type of mismatches: mis-identifications (mostly grasses and related taxa), overlooked species, and orientation/location errors; overlooked species contributed the largest single category (~39.8% of TI variations).
- Comparison with 1990 QA: improvement in agreement for many frequent species; seasonality and management changes noted as contributing factors.

### Vegetation cover
- General agreement on cover for principal species, but notable discrepancies for several grasses (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
- Statistical tests show mixed significance across species; some mismatches attributed to seasonal effects or plot relocation accuracy.
- Species-specific cover codes: overall 74.4% concordance; some under- or overestimation tendencies for certain taxa; seasonality and plot overlap influence results.

### Landcover mapping
- Primary land cover codes: high concordance; overall concordance excluding BAP codes around 91–92% depending on metric.
- BAP codes (broad habitat types): concordance around 77–78% with some systematic misclassifications (e.g., drift between related habitat types).
- Primary boundary and hedge/field boundary features: overall high concordance for primary boundary features (around 85–92% depending on metric); hedge shape coding less successful when new codes introduced; some boundary changes not consistently captured.

### Change in frequency and interpretation
- Change in land use and habitat between CS2000 and 1990: assessed using DECORANA axis scores.
- Axis score shifts for plot types generally show no directional bias between CS2000 and QA.
- Overall concordance for recorded changes: about 51.4%; substantial portion of changes either not noted by CS2000 or not substantiated by assessors.
- Indicates many changes since 1990 may be missed or miscodified; suggests caution when relying on survey changes alone for trend analysis.

### Hedge diversity and arable plots
- Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species 124; common species 92; overall concordance about 74.2% and surveyor efficiency about 77.4%.
- Arable plots (5 plots): very poor concordance; counties caution due to seasonality and less familiarity with ruderal species; recommended multiple visits for future arable margin plots.

### General interpretation
- No overall directional bias in mean axis scores between CS2000 and QA; differences are tied to location/orientation errors and to mis-matches in cover or species identification.
- Mapping and boundary coding generally robust, though some new hedge coding schemes were not fully integrated.
- Data quality varies by plot type; linear plots and road verges tend to yield higher concordance than more variable or seasonally affected plots (arable margins).

## Implications for monitoring framework authors
- Data quality hinges on accurate plot location and consistent recording of species and cover; improvements in field protocols and location verification are critical.
- Metadata and data provenance are essential; the QA process highlights the need to document plot relocation uncertainty and boundary changes.
- Data governance should address sharing of underlying data and transparency around coding schemes (including new hedge/boundary codes) to avoid misinterpretation.
- When designing monitoring frameworks, include explicit QA components (plot relocation, species concordance, cover validation, change verification) and predefine acceptable thresholds for accuracy and reproducibility.
- Consider seasonality and management effects in design and interpretation of repeated surveys; plan for multiple visits in arable margins and other dynamic habitats.
- Emphasize that while mapping codes are generally robust, ongoing training and coder consistency are needed to maintain high concordance across complex land-use categories and hedge structures.

## Annex and supplementary notes
- Annex B provides dates and efficiency data by square, illustrating variable QA efficiency across land classes and plots.
- Annexes document detailed categorization of errors (mis-identification, overlooked species, orientation/location errors) and the breakdown of deviations across plot types and land classes.
- Overall conclusion: CS2000 QA demonstrates substantial reliability in many components but identifies specific gaps (notably change recording and certain vegetation and boundary codes) that monitoring framework authors should address in future design and governance.
