# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Guidelines for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE).
- Aims to produce standardized, current, and comparable data across Great Britain on land use, habitats, vegetation, and landscape features for time-series analyses and policy-relevant insights.
- Emphasizes data quality, consistency across observers, and thorough documentation of methods and limitations.

## Governance, standards, and metadata
- Standardized data collection across numerous datasets to support monitoring, governance, and biodiversity/sustainable development indicators.
- Requires clear coding schemes, accompanying definitions, and a Field Handbook as a prerequisite for consistency.
- Documentation of uncertainties, atypical cases, and explicit comments to accompany recordings.
- Metadata, standardized codes, and change-d documentation underpin long-term governance and data lineage.

## Data collection framework and structure
- Three interlinked elements:
  - Mapping of land cover and landscape features.
  - Vegetation data collection in plots (species composition and cover).
  - Sampling plots for baseline vegetation and habitat monitoring.
- Mapping focuses on change detection, broad-habitat reporting, and upland unenclosed habitat monitoring.
- Data are recorded via the Field Assessment Booklet (FAB), which consolidates maps and data sheets per square.

## Field recording and coding
- FAB is the primary data recording package; sections cover ownership, landowner information, physiography, agriculture/natural vegetation, forestry/wildlife/trees, boundaries, buildings/structures/communications, and universal codes.
- Emphasis on data integrity and readability to reduce downstream processing errors.
- Coding framework includes a wide range of land-cover types, species codes, and 25–100% cover bands; provision for unique/temporary codes (601–699) when needed.
- Comprehensive woodland, boundary, and management coding keys (e.g., 301–369 for walls, fences, hedges; boundary/state/condition codes).

## Mapping and reporting framework
- Two mapping modes:
  - New squares: de novo mapping of land cover and landscape features.
  - Old squares: mapping changes since 1990.
- Reporting by broad habitats aligned with Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) and UK frameworks, including montane and supra-littoral categories.
- BAP-based categorizations:
  - Mappable BAPs for time-series mapping in broad habitats.
  - Plottable BAPs for additional plot-based monitoring where boundaries are complex.
- Aerial photography and API conventions are used as guidance rather than fixed inputs.

## Plot types and vegetation recording
- X plots (Wally plots): 200 m² plots with nested subplots; central to long-term vegetation change monitoring.
- Y plots: 2 m × 2 m plots in semi-natural habitats; five plots per square across land-cover types.
- U plots: Unenclosed plots for plottable broad habitats; 2 × 2 m.
- B plots: Boundary plots (hedgerows, walls, fences) at square boundaries.
- A plots: Arable field margin plots for monitoring arable weeds.
- H plots: Hedgerow plots for woody species composition along hedges.
- D plots: Hedgerow diversity plots for woody species diversity.
- S/W plots: Streamside and Waterside plots along watercourses; consider dry/wet conditions.
- GPS-enabled location rules; relocation in old squares; upland plotting uses GPS for accuracy.

## Permissions, access, and field operations
- Landowner permission required for all surveys; procedures described for pre-contact, on-site confirmation.
- If permission is denied, strategies include abandoning the square or surveying accessible portions; document ownership and permissions handling.

## Data quality, training, and change management
- Strong emphasis on observer training and QA to minimize recording variation for credible time-series.
- Explicit change-management protocols for CS1990-to-CS2000 transitions, including:
  - Mapping changes in old squares for consistency.
  - Distinguishing Mappable vs Plottable BAPs and how changes appear on FABs and BAP maps.
  - Procedures for changes in extent, splitting/merging features, or migration between BAP categories.
- Annex on GPS data collection for all upland/unenclosed plots.

## Data use, outputs, and policy relevance
- CS2000 data underpin policy-relevant assessments at national and international levels (e.g., UN/EU/UK frameworks).
- Re-surveys planned to maintain long-term trends and to ground-truth remote sensing against the ITE Land Classification System.

## Annexes and supplementary guidance
- Annex 1: Collecting GPS data for precise geolocation of plots.
- Embedded guidance on data sheet layout, coding sequences, plotting, and field workflow.

## Data accessibility and governance implications for Data Stewards
- Establishes a codified data collection protocol to enable discoverability, comparability, and reuse across years and agencies.
- Highlights the importance of metadata, standardized codes, and change documentation for governance and data lineage.
- Provides a framework for data quality control, versioning, and transparent handling of data limitations and access permissions.

## Section 10– Sampling (overview)
- Types of sampling: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, freshwater biota sampling (the latter by accredited IFE staff).
- Rationale: baseline soil data to support soil health indices and related sustainability assessments; five replicate soil samples per square.
- Procedures include sampling in 1 km squares, sample dispatch to ITE Merlewood, and detailed field logistics.

## Section 11– Photography
- One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and relation to landmarks.
- Photos must include square/plot numbers and reference features; guidance on composition and visibility.

## Section 12– Procedures after survey
- Post-survey checks to ensure all features are recorded; avoid transcription as a rule; return FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.
