# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides standardized field methods to monitor and evaluate changes in the rural environment across GB.
  - Aims to produce current, time-series, policy-relevant data with clear presentation and strong data governance.
  - Builds on CS1990 and earlier surveys, linking ecological indicators to policy drivers and reporting requirements.

- Overall data and governance approach
  - Emphasizes data quality, metadata, openness, and consistent presentation across years and regions.
  - Requires data to be verifiable, reproducible, and shareable within governance constraints.
  - Supports robust time-series analyses through standardized methods, coding, and documentation.

- Sampling types and objectives (Section 10)
  - Three main sampling streams:
    - Soil sampling: baseline soil quality data for national spatial coverage.
    - Calluna sampling: plant tissue (foliar nitrogen) to explore deposition impacts.
    - Freshwater biota sampling: conducted by accredited IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 field teams.
  - Rationale: establish baselines, understand biotic responses, and provide data for soil and ecosystem health indicators.

- Soil sampling protocol (Section 10.3–10.7)
  - In each 1 km square, five replicate soil samples for chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiology analyses.
  - Samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing; three cores per centre plot (X-plot) in each square.
  - Short-term handling: quick processing of short-core samples; longer-term handling for chemistry samples.
  - Equipment and distribution: predefined items allocated to teams; standardized packaging with square and plot identifiers.
  - Detailed field procedure: locate the centre plot, take samples with specified pipe sizes, label and bag samples, and despatch promptly.
  - Documentation: notes on sampling conditions and any deviations recorded with the samples.

- Calluna sampling protocol (Section 10.8–10.10)
  - Purpose: relate Calluna foliar nitrogen to nitrogen deposition and potential exceedance of critical loads.
  - Sample collection in each square containing Calluna vulgaris:
    - Select current year’s growth (CYG) shoots, gather 30–50 g fresh weight, random sampling across plants.
    - Pack and seal samples, allowing air circulation if slightly wet.
    - Dispatch samples to ITE Merlewood via intra-station posting or direct mail, with receipts for reclamation.

- Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11)
  - Coordinated sampling with IFE staff; scheduling to avoid conflicts with CS2000 field teams.

- Data capture, equipment, and imaging (Photography sections)
  - Photography: one camera per team; film stock for completing coverage of vegetation plots.
  - Reference features: choose obvious, permanent, and unique landmarks to anchor plots.
  - Documentation: each photo must show square/plot identifiers and reference features; framing guidelines to ensure future visibility.

- Data handling, recording, and metadata ( Vegetation and coding context)
  - Use standardized forms and field sheets; extensive taxon coding for flora and bryophytes/lichens.
  - Integration with CS1990/CS2000 datasets through consistent parcel and plot coding; notes on reclassifications and data lineage.
  - Ensures data are interoperable, traceable, and ready for public sharing under governance rules.

- Procedures after survey
  - Post-survey data checks: review data sheets for omissions; avoid unnecessary transcription unless essential.
  - Transport and secure return of FABs, samples, and associated data to ITE stations promptly.

- Annex: GPS data collection (GPS Annex)
  - Step-by-step guidance for GPS data capture in upland and unenclosed areas.
  - File naming conventions: create plot- and feature-specific data files (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to ensure traceability.
  - Operational guidance: battery and satellite checks, PDOP targets (<6 for good 3D accuracy), stationary vs moving logging, and GPS data management.
  - Tips for dealing with obstructions and using the Magellan keypad for data entry.

- Taxon coding and data dictionaries (indirectly referenced)
  - The handbook includes a comprehensive and standardized dictionary for plant and bryophyte/lichen taxa, facilitating consistent data entry and cross-year comparability.
  - Extensive mapping between traditional names and coded entries to support robust data integration.

- Enduring aims and utility
  - The CS2000 Field Handbook is designed to underpin standardized, large-scale environmental monitoring.
  - Facilitates robust time-series datasets, supports policy-relevant indicators, and provides transparent data quality and governance frameworks across years and regions.
