# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserve representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, environmental protection, and securing permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports scientific integrity and reliable policy guidance.
- Requests for information handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Access allows identification of whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10x10 km grid square) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Precise six-digit grid references may be released only in very exceptional circumstances; must be justified legally, showing IP data with equal/higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) could be used to identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are for finite periods and for specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation that data was secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released that could compromise confidentiality or reveal square locations.
- Location data must not be used to plan or execute visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms, but not the higher IP confidentiality requirements of six-digit releases.
- Licences for spatial data and four-digit references include a clause preventing attempts to identify precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licenses for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with relevant clauses; signed by a senior authorised official.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows legal procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decisions.
- CEH aims to provide preprocessing support within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; others handled case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or fee-based, negotiated case-by-case.
