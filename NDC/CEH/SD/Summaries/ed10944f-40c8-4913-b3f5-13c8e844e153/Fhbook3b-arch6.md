# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Purpose and Scope
- Standardises field data collection for Countryside Survey 2000 to enable robust year-on-year comparisons and support national policy and scientific evaluation.
- Covers planning, permissions, equipment, field procedures, data recording, mapping, and plotting across Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man where applicable).
- Aims to minimise observer variation and maximise data quality for long-term ecological assessment and landscape change detection.

## Data Model and Coding
- Three core data streams: mapping, plot-based vegetation recording, and sampling.
- Outputs aimed at national-scale indicators (land cover, broad habitats) and detailed plot-level change detection.
- Core concepts:
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) as the central data capture package; linkage to mapping and plot data.
  - Parcel-based data modelling with CS1990 parcel codes linking to CS2000 Primary Codes; new parcel numbers track changes.
  - Broad Habitat (BAP) mapping framework: Mappable BAPs (theme maps) and Plottable BAPs (upland/enclosed habitats) with corresponding plot arrangements.
- Change-focused methodology:
  - Old squares emphasize change since 1990; new squares establish baselines and map de novo where needed.
  - Mapping translations between CS1990 and BAP codes, with attention to upland vs lowland differences.

## Sampling Framework and Data Recording
- Plot types and sizes:
  - X plots: Arealand, 200 m² with nested 4 m² plots; relocation via metal plates.
  - Y plots: Small, 2 m × 2 m; baseline vegetation sampling; relocation planning.
  - U plots: Unenclosed plots; up to 10 per square; distributed across habitats.
  - B plots: Boundary plots; 200 m² at field boundaries; boundary feature coding.
  - A plots: Arable margins; 100 × 1 m along arable edges.
  - H/D/S/W/R/V plots: Various hedgerow, streamside, roadside, verge, and related habitat plots with specified dimensions.
- Plot relocation and data capture:
  - Nested plots, permanent markers, and GPS-enabled relocation for repeatability.
  - Thematic and plot-level data collection designed to support detailed change detection and habitat inventories.
- Data quality controls:
  - Emphasis on observer consistency, legibility, and standardized procedures to ensure reliable time-series data.

## Equipment, Field Logistics, Permissions, and Safety
- Equipment provisioning and stewardship:
  - Comprehensive equipment lists; maintenance responsibilities; emphasis on reuse across projects.
- Permissions and governance:
  - Landowner consent required; predefined contingencies for access denial or partial access (abandon, re-route, or relocate).
- Documentation and traceability:
  - Clear responsibilities for permissions, landowner relations, and field safety to minimize wasted fieldwork.

## Data Recording Formats and Output
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB):
  - Central data package per square; links to mapping and plot data; includes ownership, physiography, vegetation, boundaries, and universal codes.
- Thematic data recording forms:
  - Separate forms for each theme map (physiography, agriculture/vegetation, forestry, boundaries, buildings/communications).
  - First columns link to parcel numbers and CS1990 parcel codes; primary codes reflect current survey.
- Coding system:
  - Primary, secondary, and universal codes for land cover, vegetation types, boundary types, structures, and designated areas.
  - Species data: Top 200 species list used; unlisted species recorded with Latin names; bryophytes/lichens recorded selectively.
- Data integrity and relocation:
  - Legibility, accurate geographic referencing, and plotting sketches to support relocatability.
  - Photographs and GPS data used to reinforce relocation accuracy and data traceability.

## Mapping Methodology and Change Detection
- Mapping approach by square status:
  - Old squares (CS1990): change detection using predefined codes and theme maps.
  - New squares: full habitat/resource stock mapping; documentation for new parcels/features.
- BAP mapping framework:
  - Mappable BAPs: mapped on theme maps for area estimates.
  - Plottable BAPs: upland habitats with detailed plot data and additional Y/U plots.
- Change workflow:
  - For each feature, determine change relative to 1990; document with new parcel numbers, updated primary codes, and new BAP codes as needed.
  - Use of New Parcel Numbers to link 1990 features to 1998 observations; radical changes or new features get new parcel entries.
- Specific features:
  - Ponds: mapping guidance and potential cross-reference with Lowland Pond Survey data.
  - Montane/other special habitats: de novo mapping in certain cases due to translation limitations.

- Soil sampling details:
  - Five replicate samples per 1 km square for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), fauna diversity, and microbiological status; processed/stored at ITE Merlewood.
- Sample collection:
  - Three cores per X-plot: long black pipe and two short white pipes; careful handling and post-dispatch procedures.
- Calluna sampling:
  - Foliar nitrogen concentrations correlated with deposition; random sampling of current year growth across squares; samples mailed to ITE Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Conducted by IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 coordinators.

## Section: Photography (Section 11)
- Cameras provided; photograph every vegetation plot to capture appearance and landmarks.
- Reference features:
  - Obvious, unique, permanent, and viewable in all weather.
- Photo composition:
  - Include square/plot numbers on a board; frame to emphasize plot and reference features; minimize excessive sky.

## Section: Procedures After Survey (Section 12)
- Post-survey checks:
  - Read data sheets to ensure no feature is omitted; avoid transposing data unless essential.
- Data handling:
  - Transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

## Annex 1: GPS Data (GPS Data Collection)
- Battery power, satellite checks, and PDOP guidance (target PDOP < 6).
- Recording stationary vs moving features:
  - Detailed steps for starting and stopping logging; unique file naming per plot/feature (e.g., 501X4.PSE).
- File naming conventions:
  - Custom file names combining square number and plot/feature IDs; examples for new features (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
- Recording and recording rate:
  - 1-second sampling default; process to assign correct plot IDs quickly using an attribute reference list.
- Tips for relocation and unobstructed positioning:
  - Seek clear sky view; allow 3–5 minutes for stationary plots; adapt to obstructions with aerial extension as needed.

## Attribute Reference and Quick Reference Sheets
- Attribute reference list and sheet provide shortcuts to quickly select plot IDs (e.g., X1, D4, S1, W3) to accelerate data input.
