# Landscape point feature data 1998 [Countryside Survey], Great Britain

## Overview
- Landscape point features dataset from 538 1km squares across Great Britain, sampled in 1998/99.
- Source: Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Intended for landscape-scale ecological analysis and as a reference for land classification (ITE) in Great Britain.

## Data content and structure
- Spatial and temporal scope: SQUARE (1km sampling site code), YEAR, and ID (unique within a year).
- Thematic and biological attributes: THEME, THEME_NAME, PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTE, PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTE_NAME, SPECIES, SPECIES_NAME, PROPORTION, PROPORTION_RANGE.
- Land use and management: USE, USE_NAME.
- Habitat and site features: BUFFER around veteran trees/ponds, VETERAN_TREE attributes (TREE_DEAD, MISSING_LIMBS, DEAD_WOOD, DEAD_MISSING_BARK, LIGHTNING_STRIKES, HOLLOW_TRUNK), CANOPY_LIVE, EPIPHYTE_COVER, IVY_COVER, LC07 and LC07_NUM (ITE Land Classification 2007), EZ_DESC_07.
- Location and classification: COUNTRY, COUNTY07, LC07_NUM, LC07_NAME, and EZ_DESC_07; metadata for environment zones and land classification.
- Metadata fields: MODAL_DBH, MODAL_DBH_RANGE, VETERAN_TREE_TYPE and VETERAN_TREE_TYPE_NAME.
- Notes: All data use requires acknowledgement; dataset includes references and links to supporting publications and methodologies.

## Data use, access, and governance
- Acknowledgement requirement: “Countryside Survey data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology” and copyright notice apply to all copies, publications, and presentations.
- Reference framework: linked publications and external resources (e.g., Countryside Survey website, ITE Land Classification 1996/2007, JNCC guidance) to support interpretation and integration.
- Discoverability and updates: data are part of a broader Countryside Survey data ecosystem; users should verify data content, format, and any updates or errata through the Countryside Survey channels.

## Data quality, standards, and interoperability
- Standardized attributes and codes (themes, attributes, land classification, and habitat descriptors) to support interoperability with other biodiversity and land-use datasets.
- Potential quality considerations: variability in data detail across variables (e.g., richness of veteran-tree attributes, cover codes), and the need to verify content and format prior to analysis.
- Metadata richness supports data governance, repeatability, and integration with broader datasets.

## Practical implications for Data Leaders
- Data governance: ensure proper acknowledgment and licensing in all outputs; manage metadata quality and data provenance.
- Data discovery and integration: incorporate into a broader data catalog; align with ITE Land Classification 2007 and related biodiversity datasets.
- Data quality management: assess and document limitations, data provenance, and any gaps (e.g., granularity in certain attributes).
- Collaboration and reuse: leverage references and methodologies from the Countryside Survey ecosystem; engage with the data community to improve discoverability and standardization.
- Stewardship considerations: plan for updates, versioning, and alignment with other Countryside Survey datasets to support ongoing policy and analytical needs.
