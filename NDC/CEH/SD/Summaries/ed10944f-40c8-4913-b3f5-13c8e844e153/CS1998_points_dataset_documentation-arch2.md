# Landscape point feature data 1998 [Countryside Survey], Great Britain

## Overview
- Landscape point features collected from 538 1km squares across Great Britain in 1998/99.
- Data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH); Countryside Survey is the underlying project.
- Intended to support monitoring of environmental condition and policy performance over time through standardized data.

## Purpose, methods and standardisation
- Data are collected and coded using established Countryside Survey methodologies.
- Focus on verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and standardised outputs.
- Enables categorisation and comparison of environmental health against standards over time.

## Outputs and data accessibility
- Designed to support outputs such as reports, maps, and charts.
- Data should be stored and uploaded to appropriate portals; aligns with the monitoring archetype’s “store and share” practice.
- Emphasises the ability to combine with other datasets for expanded value (multi-source analyses).
