# THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

- Summary of purpose
  - Documents the sampling framework and evolution of the ITE Land Classification used for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
  - Demonstrates how the methodology has evolved over 30 years to support robust, stratified ecological sampling of Great Britain.

- Core concept: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling
  - Stratified, random sampling is used to ensure samples represent the diversity of land types and ecological conditions.
  - Land Classification is the backbone: environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) group land into classes to guide sampling.

- Timeline of major developments and surveys
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
    - Use Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to produce 32 land classes from 1 km squares drawn from a 15 km grid.
    - Classified 6039 km squares; sampled 8 squares per class (256 total) for national habitat estimates.
    - National estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per square with land-class area.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
    - Estimates based on the 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 (3rd Field Survey; All Squares Land Classification)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every 1 km square in GB (all squares), allowing national estimates with full coverage.
    - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats recorded; first integration with Land Cover mapping.
    - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - 1998 (4th Field Survey; Revised Land Classification)
    - Land Classification updated to support separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
    - Survey: 569 squares; national estimates recalibrated using the revised classification.
  - 2000 (CS2000; Separate country estimates introduced)
    - Need for England & Wales and Scotland-only estimates identified.
    - Implemented country-unit versions of land classes (creating 40 strata), added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation, with additional adjustments to Wales (including uplands module).
    - Wales received extra sampling to improve Wales-only estimates; Isle of Man sampling recalibrated.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Wales-only reporting and further refinements)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements driven by devolved policy needs.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions, increasing to 45 strata; 43 additional Welsh squares added; minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class.
    - England adjustments: some classes reduced to 4 squares per class but deemed acceptable for reporting accuracy.
    - Uplands module expanded with an additional 30 squares to improve upland habitat estimates for England & Wales.

- Country-specific and upland adaptations
  - England, Scotland, and Wales treated as distinct units for country-specific estimates.
  - Wales required additional classes (Welsh-specific subdivisions: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and more Welsh sampling.
  - An uplands module was added in CS2000 to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats.

- Data governance, consistency, and methodological notes
  - Changing the Land Classification has implications for national estimate consistency; two approaches are discussed:
    - Use the latest country-specific classification for each survey, preserving internal consistency.
    - Use the 1990 baseline classification for cross-survey consistency.
  - Cross-survey comparability requires careful attention to:
    - Class subdivision and aggregation across country units.
    - Representation of classes within each country.
    - Updated sampling rates and the total number of squares per survey.

- Data outputs and representations
  - Detailed tables ( Tables and figures in the full document) illustrate:
    - Number of squares by class per survey.
    - Spatial distribution maps of the sampling framework across GB and country units.
    - Summary of squares surveyed per class and per country for CS2007.
  - The document includes a comprehensive historical appendix tracing the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its application.

- Implications for Data Leaders
  - The importance of a robust, stratified sampling approach to achieve representative, time-series data.
  - Necessity to plan for country-specific reporting in a devolved governance context and to maintain sufficient sample sizes per class to ensure precision.
  - Recognition that updates to the classification framework can affect comparability; establish clear data lineage and versioning.
  - Need to address under-represented classes and ensure adequate sampling in upland regions to improve estimation accuracy.
  - Demonstrates the value of embedding upland-focused modules to improve habitat estimates in higher altitudes and marginal uplands.
