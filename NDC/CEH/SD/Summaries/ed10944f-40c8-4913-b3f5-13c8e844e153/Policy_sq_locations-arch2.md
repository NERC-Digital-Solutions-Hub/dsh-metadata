# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximise public use of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while protecting future surveys and site anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners include CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
  - Public-interest stance; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Circumstances for location release and precision
  - Four-digit grid references (approximate locations) may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing a CS square.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing analysis by CEH to avoid release; exceptional external release may be granted only in very limited cases.
  - Spatial data from within survey squares could reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional-terms as six-digit data.

- Conditions of release and licensing
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained after the licence ends.
  - Post-project destruction confirmation required; no data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but need not meet the highest IP confidentiality criteria required for six-digit releases.
  - Licences include clauses preventing attempts to deduce exact square locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, decides on exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data; licences must be signed by an authorized representative of the licensee.
  - If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI/EIR procedures to support the decision.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS partner uses within moderate demand; external requests are case-by-case.
  - Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by the policy to define requirements and/or obtain support, which may be negotiated on a case-by-case basis (involving collaboration or payment as appropriate).
