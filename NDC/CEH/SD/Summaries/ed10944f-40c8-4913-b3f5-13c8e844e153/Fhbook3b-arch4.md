# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- The CS2000 Field Handbook documents GB-wide field surveying activities for monitoring land use, land cover, and landscape features, with standardized protocols to ensure data consistency, traceability, and integration with broader biodiversity and environmental monitoring frameworks.

## Executive scope and aims for data leadership

- Establishes national, spatially referenced soil, vegetation, and landscape data across 1 km squares, enabling time-series analysis and policy-relevant indicators.
- Integrates multiple data streams (soil chemistry, soil fauna, microbiology, vegetation plots, and photography) to support robust change detection and biodiversity assessments.
- Facilitates data sharing and governance through standardized field records (FABs), sampling forms, maps, and GPS data, enabling collaboration with government, NGOs, and research partners.

## Sampling design

- Uses the CS1990 1 km square framework, continuing a linked time-series approach with potential enhancements for country representation and habitat classes.
- Within each square, five replicate soil samples are collected for chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiological status, processed at ITE Merlewood.
- Vegetation and landscape data are gathered via predefined plot types and sampling layouts, with attention to representativeness across habitat types.
- Ground-truthing combines field surveys with map-based interpretation, supported by standardized field sheets, photographs, and location records.

## Soil sampling procedure (three cores per X-plot)

- In each 1 km square, five replicate soil samples are collected from centre plots within X-plots (2 x 2 m).
- Three cores are taken using plastic piping: one long (15 cm) black pipe and two short (8 cm) white pipes, positioned at specific offsets from the centre corner (15 cm north, then 15 cm east and 15 cm west for subsequent samples).
- Procedures include marking sampling points, careful extraction with minimal soil loss, sealing and labeling samples, and prompt posting to ITE Merlewood for processing.
- All samples are packaged with labeled envelopes and bags, stored in vehicles, and posted as soon as feasible to maintain sample integrity.

## Calluna vulgaris sampling

- Collect current year's growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from Calluna vulgaris stands, at random across multiple plants within the square.
- Label, seal, and ship samples to ITE Merlewood, ensuring timely dispatch to support nitrogen deposition analyses linked to Calluna foliar chemistry.

## Freshwater sampling

- Conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff in coordination with CS2000 activities, timing arranged to fit within the overall survey schedule.

## Photography

- Each field team receives a camera; photographs document every vegetation plot to illustrate appearance and context.
- Reference features used for orientation must be obvious, unique, permanent, and clearly visible in plots.
- Each photo includes the square/plot identification on a board placed at plot edges; aim for framing that highlights the plot while avoiding excessive sky.

## Procedures after survey

- Daily review of data sheets to confirm completeness and identify omissions; avoid post-hoc transcriptions unless necessary due to damage.
- Transport all Field Assessment Books (FABs), maps, photos, and samples back to ITE stations as soon as possible to ensure data integrity and processing timeliness.

## Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data

- Ensures proper GPS setup: satellite lock (at least four satellites) and PDOP ideally below 6 for accurate positioning.
- Two recording modes: stationary positions (plot locations) and moving features (boundaries in upland areas); create a separate data file for each plot/feature (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4).
- Detailed steps for recording, including naming conventions, logging controls, and start/stop procedures; guidance on handling new features and feature attribute coding.
- Equipment notes: battery management, almanac updates, and handling obstructions (e.g., tall vegetation) by temporarily elevating the antenna.
- Data management: use standardized attribute references to quickly locate plot identifiers and ensure consistent GPS data capture across teams.

## Data quality and governance implications for data leaders

- Emphasizes standardized, traceable data collection across soil, vegetation, and freshwater domains to support reliable time-series analyses.
- Relies on Field Assessment Books (FABs), labeled sample containers, and GPS logs to enable reproducibility and relocation of plots.
- Requires timely data transfer to central facilities (ITE Merlewood) for processing and integration with national datasets.
- Supports cross-partner collaboration by aligning survey efforts with broader biodiversity and environmental policy objectives through consistent metadata and documentation.
