# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim and scope
  - Maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of survey site locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- Partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
  - Confidentiality decisions accord with the UK Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- Release under specific circumstances
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence to identify approximate locations.
  - Six-digit grid references require exceptional access; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release; exceptional release requires legal demonstration that the data or associated IP has equal or higher confidentiality.
  - Spatial data inside squares could reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional conditions as six-digit references.

- License terms and restrictions
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at period end.
  - No release to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to plan or conduct visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - Licensees may need to provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same IP confidentiality as six-digit releases.
  - License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and procedures
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; licences must be signed by a senior authorised official.
  - If a release is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report on licence applications, decisions, and rationales.
  - CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; external requests handled case-by-case.
  - Partner organisations are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by the policy; CEH involvement may be voluntary or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

- Practical implications for data leaders
  - Distinguish clearly between publicly accessible CS data and restricted location data.
  - Incorporate licensing, security, and confidentiality requirements into data governance and access strategies.
  - Plan for potential need for pre-processing analyses and formal licensing when external parties request location data.
  - Engage CEH early in data-sharing considerations to ensure compliant and efficient use of CS location data.
