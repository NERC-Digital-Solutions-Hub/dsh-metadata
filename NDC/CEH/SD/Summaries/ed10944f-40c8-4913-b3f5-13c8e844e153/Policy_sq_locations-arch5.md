# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- CS partners include CEH (as hub for NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidential to preserve representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
- Public-interest rationale; requests handled by CEH under the UK Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Access may identify whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to show approximate location.
- Six-digit grid references (precise location) may be released only under very exceptional circumstances, after CEH pre-processing analysis to avoid sharing data unnecessarily; exceptional cases require legal demonstration that IP data to be used with CS data has equal/higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carries equivalent confidentiality and may be released only under the same exceptional terms.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to authorized individuals for the agreed purpose.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licensing period.
- End-of-period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; no use to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP requirements than six-digit releases; four-digit data must not be used to derive precise square locations.

## Roles, approvals, and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases; CEH issues hard-copy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to offer reasonable pre-processing support to CS partner organisations; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data under this policy; CEH support may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
