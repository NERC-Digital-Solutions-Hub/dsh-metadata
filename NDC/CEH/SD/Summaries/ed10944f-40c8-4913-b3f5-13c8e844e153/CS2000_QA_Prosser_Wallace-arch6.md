COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

Overview
- A Quality Assurance (QA) exercise to assess the consistency and reliability of CS2000 field work.
- Sample: 38 of 519 squares; in each square one quarter resurveyed; 234 species plots across nine plot types.
- Focus areas: plot relocation, species concordance, accuracy of percentage cover estimates, effects of recording on habitat-change analyses, comparability with CS1990, landuse mapping, and recording of changes.

Aims
- Quantify field recording accuracy for CS2000 and assess change statistics.
- Evaluate plot relocation efficiency and observer-related biases.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, plot location/relocation, plot type, management and seasonal effects.
- Relate CS2000 findings to CS1990 comparability.
- Assess landuse mapping accuracy and the efficiency of recording changes.

Methods and Scope
- QA involved 38 squares; one quarter resurveyed per square; 234 plots analyzed; seven main plot types (quadrats, X/Y/U plots, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins).
- Plate and plot relocation assessed using 1990 sketches, photographs, and metal detectors; target: accurate relocation of plates and plots eight years on.
- Data compared: species records, cover estimates, landcover and boundary codes, hedge diversity, and changes since 1990.

Key Findings

Plot relocation and plate/plot location
- 86.7% of plots were satisfactorily relocated (28 of 210 could not be relocated).
- CS2000 surveyors: about 60% accurately relocated plots; ~25% relocated approximately; ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Small 4 m Habitat (Y) plots most difficult: 23% failure.
- Plate recovery: assessors located 69.3% of plates; total recovery possibly 40–45% when including approximate relocations (compared with 65.2% in 1991 CS1990 QA).
- Overall, relocating plots eight years on is feasible but less reliable than 12-month QA; accuracy similar to previous QA despite different conditions.

Species concordance and recording accuracy
- Approximately 6000 CS2000 records analyzed; 71% confirmed by QA assessors as present in original plots.
- Non-concordances largely due to real changes (management/seasonal effects) accounting for ~2%.
- Initial recording accuracy estimated around 73%, close to CS1990’s ~78%.
- Mis-matches mainly due to: mis-identifications, overlooked species, wrong box-tick, and mis-location/orientation of plots.

Vegetation cover estimates
- For 30 frequent species with appreciable cover, six grasses showed significantly different cover levels between CS2000 and QA (some seasonal effects).
- Overall, cover at landuse sample points showed reasonable agreement; notable differences for certain species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Eriophorum vaginatum) with some seasonal influence.

Changes in frequency of prevalent species
- The ranking of species frequency generally aligned between CS2000 and QA, but about 13% of species showed discrepancies in frequency counts.
- Some species under- or over-recorded (e.g., Poa trivialis, Agrostis capillaris, Ranunculus repens, Molinia caerulea, etc.), often related to identification challenges and plot location/orientation issues.
- Overall implication: differences tend to average out over many plots, but substantial mis-recording persists for a minority of common species.

Landscape mapping and landcover codes
- Primary landcover codes: concordance high; overall primary land cover agreement ~87.5% (excluding BAPs); BAP codes lower (~77.4% for BAPs).
- Landcover classifications at sample points (cover/landuse): moderate to good agreement (e.g., around 63% for individual cover codes; higher when considering combined cover-qualifier data, ~71–89% depending on metric).
- Primary boundary features and hedge types: high concordance for boundary codes and boundary heights; stockproof judgments also consistent; some mis-classifications (e.g., specific hedge boundary codes) noted.
- Change in landuse codes (CS1990 -> CS2000 changes): concordance low to moderate; overall change concordance ~51.4%; substantial portion of changes not recorded or not substantiated by assessors, indicating challenges in reliably detecting and coding changes over time.

 Hedge diversity and boundary details
- Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
- Mean number of species per hedge plot: CS2000 5.16 vs QA 5.89.
- Boundary features: high agreement for boundary heights and stockproof status (boundary height concordance ~89.2%; stockproof ~83.8%); some mis-matches in boundary codes and occasional omissions.

Arable plots
- Five arable margin plots; concordance extremely poor: overall ~30.6% agreement.
- Seasonality and unfamiliarity with ruderal species likely contributors; recommends two well-spaced visits for future arable margin plots to improve reliability.

Overall changes in ordination and bias
- DECORANA ordination: no significant directional bias between CS2000 and QA axis-1 scores for plot types; mean axis scores CS2000 vs QA were not significantly different.
- When grouped by landclass, no consistent bias detected across landclasses.

General conclusions and implications for data support
- CS2000 data are generally reliable for mapping and community-level patterns, with high concordance in primary landcover and many mapping elements.
- Major data reliability challenges stem from plot relocation accuracy and mis-location/orientation, which strongly influence species concordance and change detection.
- Change detection (landuse/structure changes) is less reliable; substantial changes recorded by surveyors are not always substantiated by QA assessors.
- Arable margin plots require additional field visits to improve reliability; hedges and boundaries show robust coding but some boundary-type misclassifications remain.
- For data products intended to support policy or public-facing analyses, it is advisable to treat change statistics with caution and to incorporate QA-derived flags or confidence measures for plots with relocation/orientation uncertainties.

Additional notes for data support practice
- Maintain and enhance permanent plot markers to improve relocation reliability over long intervals.
- Consider multiple visits or intensified protocols for plots prone to mis-location/orientation errors (especially linear plots like road verges).
- Use QA findings to calibrate automated data products and to provide end users with clear caveats about potential changes not substantiated by QA.
- The QA approach provides a robust framework to quantify observer effects, method biases, and code concordance across landcover and boundary classifications, informing data integration and provenance documentation.
