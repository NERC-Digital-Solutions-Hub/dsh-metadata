# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the development and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
- Describes how stratified, random sampling of 1 km squares is used to monitor habitat distribution and change across Great Britain, with national estimates calculated from class-based proportions.
- Explains how the classification and sampling framework evolved to enable country-specific reporting (England & Wales; Scotland) and Wales-only reporting, and introduces an uplands module to improve accuracy in upland habitats.

## The ITE Land Classification and Stratified Sampling
- Core idea: stratify land into discrete classes (land classes) to ensure samples are representative of the whole country and to reduce bias from purely random sampling.
- Origin: The ITE Land Classification grew from extending vegetation-plot classification (ISA) to landscape scale using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) to define 1 km squares.
- Sampling unit: 1 km squares across GB; core sampling approach uses a center square plus surrounding squares to classify and allocate samples.
- National estimates: calculated by multiplying the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class by the total area of that class; aggregates across classes yield country and national estimates.
- Evolution of classifications: began with 32 classes (1978) and progressed to 40 (1990), then to 45 (2000), and to 45 with country-unit subdivisions (2007).

## Timeline of Countryside Survey Samplings

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
- Developed a 32-class ITE Land Classification using environmental data for 1228 center 1 km squares (plus four surrounding squares per center).
- 256 squares surveyed (8 per class) focusing on vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat areas estimated by class proportions.
- National estimates based on mean habitat per square within each Land Class and the area of each class.

### 1984 – Second Field Survey
- Expanded sampling to 12 squares per Land Class (total 384).
- Continued use of 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- Change statistics between 1978 and 1984 published subsequently.

### 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (All Squares) and Third Field Survey
- Land Classification revised to cover all 1 km squares in GB; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
- 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats; additional habitat features recorded.
- Resulted in the first Land Cover Map of GB linked to CS1990 results.

### 1998 – Revised Land Classification and Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
- Land Classification extended to classify every square in GB; significant re-structuring and surrogates used due to computational limits.
- Land Classes increased to 40; sampling framework adjusted for regional and local estimates.
- Separate country estimates introduced: England & Wales, and Scotland; class sub-division and aggregation created 40 strata in total.
- Additional samples deployed to ensure adequate representation of new classes; uplands module introduced to improve upland habitat estimates.
- Wales and the Isle of Man adjustments described to align with country-specific reporting.

### 2007 – Revised Land Classification and Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
- Wales-only reporting emphasized; addressing devolution-driven demand for Wales-specific habitat status and change data.
- Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions for England & Wales, creating five new Welsh classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); overall 45 strata.
- Wales received 43 additional sample squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class); England sampling adjusted with some classes existing at 4 squares.
- Wales became the most intensively sampled country; England retained sufficient samples for reporting purposes.
- Revised country maps and sampling framework published to reflect England with Wales and Scotland; sample counts adjusted accordingly.

## National and Country-based Estimation
- National estimates rely on the latest Land Classification and country-unit adjustments to allocate samples by class and country.
- Note on consistency: changing the basic classification for national estimates affects the comparability of stock estimates across surveys; CS prefers using the latest classification for consistency within a survey, while older classifications align more closely across surveys.
- Tables and figures (CS1978–CS2007) illustrate sample sizes, strata areas, and country-specific distributions; CS2007 aggregates are presented as country-based results, with Wales receiving targeted sampling enhancements.

## Welsh and Upland Adjustments
- Wales-only reporting requirements led to sub-division of Land Classes and increased Welsh sampling intensity in CS2007.
- England- only adjustments did not proportionally increase, leaving some classes with lower sample counts but deemed acceptable for reporting purposes.
- An uplands module was added in CS2000 to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Uplands Module (CS2000)
- Added 30 squares allocated to upland and marginal upland Land Classes to strengthen habitat estimates in upland regions.
- Supports more robust country-based estimates for upland habitats when producing England & Wales and Scotland statistics.

## Notes and Context
- The Sampling Strategy emphasizes data quality, representativeness, and the ability to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
- The framework continuously adapts to policy needs (country-specific reporting) while maintaining a consistent methodological basis for trend analysis across decades.
- The overarching aim is to maximize the usefulness and accessibility of the environmental datasets generated by Countryside Survey, aligning with the Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype’s focus on standardized, auditable outputs.
