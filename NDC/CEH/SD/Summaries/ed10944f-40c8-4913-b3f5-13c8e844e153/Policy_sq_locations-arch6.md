# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Summary
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- CS partners include CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.
- Confidentiality protects sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, ensuring scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserves representativeness of sampling sites.
- Maintains landowner goodwill and willingness to allow surveys.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Public-interest stance; licensing decisions governed by policy and law.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for locating approximate areas.
- Six-digit grid references require pre-processing by CEH to avoid direct release; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases may external release be granted under licence.
- Spatial data within squares (habitat maps, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
- Licences constrain use to specified projects; data must not be used to locate individual squares or plan visits.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to authorized personnel.
- Licences are finite in duration and linked to specific projects; data must be destroyed at end of period.
- No dissemination to third parties that could compromise square locations; no use to monitor landowner compliance.
- May require evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; licensing terms prohibit attempts to derive exact square locations.

## Responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows Act and Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case for external requests.
- Partners and potential users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for data support
- Understands confidential nature and licensing pathways for CS location data.
- Identify appropriate release level (four-digit vs six-digit) based on necessity and confidentiality constraints.
- Plan data access with secure handling, restricted access, and clear project scoping to ensure temporary, license-bound use.
- Engage CEH early to explore preprocessing options and to align with JCOP-equivalent standards where required.
