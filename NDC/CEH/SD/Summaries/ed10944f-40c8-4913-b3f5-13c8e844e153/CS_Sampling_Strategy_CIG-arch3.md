# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Purpose and scope
- Documents the field survey sampling framework used by Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
- Builds on the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative, stratified sampling across Great Britain.
- Aims to support time-series habitat and land-use estimates for policy relevance, change detection, and decision-making.
- Emphasizes the importance of stratification to reduce bias and improve comparability across surveys and regions.

## Core concepts and design
- Stratified random sampling: geographic land classes (strata) are sampled to represent variability across Britain.
- Land Classification: originated from the ITE system; areas are grouped into land classes with similar environmental attributes.
- Sample unit: 1 km x 1 km squares central to a 15 x 15 km grid; early designs used centre squares with surrounding squares to assign class; total squares surveyed per survey varied by year.
- Data workflow: for each selected square, field data on vegetation, habitat features, soils, and land use are collected; national estimates derive from class-level means combined with class areas.

## Evolution across Countryside Survey years

- CS1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to create 32 land classes from environmental data of 1,228 centre squares.
  - Classified surrounding squares to extend context, yielding 6,039 km2 of classified squares.
  - Surveyed 8 squares per land class, totaling 256 squares.
  - National habitat estimates derived by multiplying mean habitat area per square by land-class area.

- CS1984 – Second Field Survey
  - Expanded sampling: 12 squares per land class (total 384). Eight original squares retained.
  - National estimates continued to be based on the 1978 Land Classification framework.

- CS1990 – All Squares Land Classification and Third Field Survey
  - Land Classification updated to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; urban and sea corrections applied.
  - Survey comprised 508 squares; repeated vegetation quadrats from 1978 and new data collection added.
  - Results linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.

- CS2000 – Revised Land Classification and Fourth Field Survey
  - Land Classification expanded to enable separate reporting for Scotland and England with Wales; alignment with policy needs for regional estimates.
  - Introduction of country-unit versions of land classes, class subdivision and aggregation to form 40 strata.
  - Added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; additional Wales-specific sampling to support Wales reporting.
  - Introduced an uplands module (funded separately) to improve upland habitat estimates and statistical precision.

- CS2007 – Welsh adjustments and Wales-focused reporting
  - Wales-specific reporting requirements driven by devolved governance necessitated Wales-only estimates.
  - Sub-division of several land classes into Wales- and England-specific versions, creating five new Welsh classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expanding strata to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure minimum representation in all Welsh classes; some English classes (5e, 15e) retained lower sample counts due to precision considerations.
  - England totals adjusted correspondingly; Isle of Man samples replaced for country-unit reporting.
  - Overall, the CS2007 sampling framework provided England-with-Wales and Scotland country-unit estimates with Wales-specific stratification.

## Land Classification development and class counts
- 32 land classes (CS1978) to describe broad environmental variation.
- 40 land classes (CS1990/CS1998) introduced to improve regional reporting and policy relevance.
- 45 land classes (CS2000/CS2007) through sub-divisions and additions to support Wales- and England-specific reporting and Wales upland representation.
- Class structure underpins sampling allocation and national estimates; devolution and cross-border reporting influenced class definitions and sample distribution.

## Country units and sampling representation
- National estimates originally pooled across England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man.
- CS2000 introduced country-unit reporting (England with Wales; Scotland) to meet country-specific policy needs.
- Wales and England-specific class divisions, with careful reallocation and occasional aggregation to maintain robust representation per country unit.
- Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates and replaced to maintain country-focused reporting.

## Uplands module and targeted improvements
- CS2000 included an uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland and marginal upland areas of England and Wales.
- Aimed to increase statistical precision for upland habitats within country-unit reporting.

## Outputs, comparability, and governance considerations
- Outputs include main survey reports for each iteration (CS1990, CS2000 UK results for 2007, etc.).
- Note on national estimates: changing the underlying Land Classification affects cross-survey comparability; researchers preferred to use the latest classification for internal consistency while recognizing archival comparability with original schemes.
- Data sharing and metadata considerations: while not a primary focus in this document, the strategy implies careful handling of class definitions, sampling frames, and country-unit delineations to support policy-relevant monitoring over time.

## Implications for monitoring framework authors
- Demonstrates a rigorous, policy-relevant approach to environmental health monitoring through structured stratified sampling and evolving classification frameworks.
- Highlights the importance of maintaining comparability across time while adapting to governance needs (e.g., devolved administrations requiring Wales- or country-specific reporting).
- Illustrates how data governance considerations (classification changes, metadata consistency, sampling documentation) underpin credible, shareable outputs for policy evaluation and future decision-making.
