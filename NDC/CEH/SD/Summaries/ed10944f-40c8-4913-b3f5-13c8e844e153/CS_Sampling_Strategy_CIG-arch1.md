# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- A historical account of how Countryside Survey field sampling and the ITE Land Classification have evolved from 1978 to 2007, forming the core framework for national, regional, and country-specific environmental estimates in Great Britain.

## Core purpose and approach
- Establishes a stratified, random sampling framework to ensure samples are representative of Britain’s land types and ecological variation.
- Uses the ITE Land Classification as the environmental stratification basis to divide land into discrete classes (strata) for sampling.
- Field surveys focus on vegetation, soils, land use, and habitat mapping, with national estimates derived by combining class-level statistics with land-class areas.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification (concepts and origins)
- Based on early work by Bunce and Shaw who classified vegetation types in a scalable way using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) rather than plant species alone.
- The initial national framework (mid-1970s) classified a subset of 1 km squares (center squares of a 15x15 km grid) into 32 land classes using a multivariate approach (Indicator Species Analysis, ISA).
- Surrounding four squares were assigned to the same classes to broaden each classification’s representation.
- The resulting framework allowed a stratified sampling design across Great Britain.

## Sampling framework by survey year

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & first field survey)
  - 32 land classes derived from environmental data across 1 km squares (center squares of a 15x15 km grid; 1228 classified; plus surrounding squares).
  - 8 squares were surveyed per land class (total 256 squares).
  - National habitat estimates were produced by multiplying the mean habitat area per square within each class by the land-class area.

- 1984 (Second GB land-use survey)
  - Same sampling framework as 1978 but increased sample size by 50% to 12 squares per class (total 384 squares), including eight previously visited.
  - Emphasis shifted toward land use and habitat mapping rather than soils/plants.

- 1990 (All Squares land classification; third field survey)
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all 1 km squares in GB (extension to classify every square, urban/sea corrections).
  - 508 squares surveyed; the 1984 data were supplemented with the 1990 scheme for national estimates.
  - Publication of Countryside Survey 1990 main report; first linkage of the Land Classification with a Land Cover map.

- 1990–2000 (Development of a refined GB-wide classification)
  - Recognition that every GB square should be classed for regional/local estimates; due to computing limits, a surrogate-based approach was used.
  - A comparison between the original 1228-square classes and new simulations showed only 62% exact correspondence; most mismatches fell into neighboring classes with similar characteristics.
  - Result: a revised classification was accepted as a reasonable replacement for national-scale estimation despite some class-shifts affecting representation.

- 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000; planning and country-specific estimates)
  - Considered sample sizing for modules and established the need for separate England & Wales vs Scotland estimates.
  - Introduced class subdivision and aggregation to create “country unit” versions of classes; expanded to 40 strata.
  - Added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; additional 11 squares allocated for balance (England and Wales).
  - Land Class 17 sub-divided in Wales to better reflect Welsh habitats; Isle of Man squares removed and replaced.
  - An uplands module was added to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.

- 2007 (Countryside Survey 2007; Wales-specific reporting and framework refinements)
  - Wales required Wales-only reporting; Welsh sampling was increased and five new country-unit classes were added (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Resulted in 45 strata (up from 40); 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - England lost some Welsh squares; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained at 4 squares, deemed acceptable for precision.
  - Revised land-class maps for England-with-Wales and Scotland published; sample squares distributed across three countries.

## Country-specific considerations and uplands module
- Welsh-only estimates prompted sub-divisions of land classes and dedicated Welsh sampling to meet policy and reporting needs.
- England and Wales uplands were further sampled (30 extra squares) to improve accuracy for upland habitat estimates.

## National estimates and consistency
- Throughout, a key tension was choosing whether to estimate using the latest country-wide Land Classification (three separate classifications for England & Wales, Scotland, etc.) or the original 1990 classification to maintain cross-survey consistency.
- The 2006 scoping guidance preferred using the latest classifications for country-specific estimates, noting trade-offs in cross-survey consistency.

## Key numbers and visual summaries
- CS1978: 256 squares surveyed across 32 land classes (8 per class).
- CS1984: 384 squares surveyed (12 per class); eight prior squares re-sampled.
- CS1990: 508 squares surveyed; expansion to classify all 1 km squares in GB (All Squares). First linkage to a Land Cover map.
- CS2000: England & Wales total GB squares considered; multiple subtype tallies across 40 strata; several hundred squares allocated per country-unit configuration; uplands module added; 9–30+ squares per class depending on class and country.
- CS2007: Wales-focused adjustments; 45 strata total; 43 additional Welsh squares; England maintains most classes but with some low counts (e.g., 4 squares in two English classes).

## Notes on data use and transparency
- The framework integrates class-based area weighting with observed square-level habitat data to produce national and country-level habitat estimates.
- The approach emphasized documenting and tracking changes in the Land Classification over time, and how those changes affected comparability of estimates across surveys.
- The strategy also provides for future data discoverability by aligning class maps and sample locations with the corresponding survey edition.
