# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- A QA exercise on 38 of the 519 CS2000 squares to assess consistency and reliability across fieldwork components.
- Re-surveyed one quarter of each selected square, recording 234 plots across nine plot types.
- Aimed to quantify field recording accuracy, plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, accuracy of vegetation cover estimates, and landcover mapping and its changes; compared CS2000 with CS1990 and with QA assessments.

## Objectives
- Quantify field recording accuracy and change statistics
- Examine plot relocation efficiency
- Explain recording differences due to observer error, plot location/orientation, management, season
- Relate findings to overall accuracy and to prior CS1990 results
- Assess mapping accuracy (primary codes, descriptive codes, cover codes) and changes since 1990

## Methods
- Selection of 38 out of 519 squares; one quarter resurveyed; 234 plots analyzed
- Seven plot types (quadrats and linear plots) including road verges, streamsides, arable margins, hedges, boundaries, etc.
- Plot relocation assessed using buried plates, sketches, photographs, and metal detectors; assessment of plate recovery and plot location eight years on
- Comparative analysis between CS2000 survey data and QA data, plus comparison with 1990 CS surveys
- Annex-based protocol for field location, mapping points, and data coding; QA data collection dates summarized in Annex B

## Key Findings

### Plot relocation and plate recovery
- Relocation success varied by plot type; overall, approximately 60% of CS2000 plots were accurately relocated, about 25% were relocated to a reasonable degree, and roughly 15% were inadequately relocated.
- QA assessors recovered about 69.3% of plates; overall plate/plot recovery around 40–45% for some measures, with higher success in plots not heavily disturbed.
- Eight-year relocation is feasible with substantial non-location-related errors still present (e.g., incorrect side of stream or hedge).

### Species concordance and recording accuracy
- Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4; QA tends to record longer species lists.
- Percentage agreement on species present (TI vs T2) across all plots ~76–87% depending on measure; overall agreement around 87–89% when comparing survey and QA results.
- Mis-identifications and plot-location/orientation errors were substantial contributors to mismatches; some differences attributed to seasonal effects, especially for management and vegetation changes.
- Across plot types, the rank order of plot richness largely matched between CS2000 and QA, though verges and streamsides fluctuated in relative richness.

### Vegetation cover estimates
- Visual cover estimates for species (above 5%) were generally concordant, but certain species showed significant differences (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum) between CS2000 and QA, with some species being over- or under-estimated by surveyors.
- Overall, cover concordance by species codes was around 74.4%, with some species showing low concordance due to seasonal changes and identification challenges.
- Where both surveyors and QA assessed the same species at the same location, cover coding agreement was high (about 89.2% when looking at exact same codes), though omission rates contributed to overall discrepancies.

### Landcover mapping and boundary coding
- Primary land cover codes: high concordance; overall primary land cover agreement ~87.5% (excluding BAPs).
- BAP codes: lower concordance (~77.4%), largely due to boundary and habitat delineation differences between surveys.
- Primary boundary features: very high concordance (~92%), with some inconsistencies in boundary presence (e.g., hedges or fences no longer present).
- Hedge/Wall boundary and wall condition: moderate concordance (~67.5%), with notable mismatches in hedge shapes and wall condition coding.
- Boundary height and stockproof status: high agreement on height and stockproof nature (around 89–92% code concordance).

### Change in land use and coded changes
- Change concurrence (CS2000 vs QA) was moderate to low: about 51.4% overall.
- Change not noted by CS2000: ~33.9%; changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors: ~14.7%.
- Many changes since 1990 appeared to be missed or mis-coded in the CS2000 records; some changes likely real, but the QA results suggest substantial under-recording of change by the original surveyors.
- There were instances of mis-codings or omissions when changes occurred (e.g., hedge type changes, crop changes); QA indicated a need for improved change verification and data entry checks.

### Arable plots
- Five arable margin plots examined; concordance was very poor, with seasonality and uncertain identification of ruderal species contributing to mismatches.
- Recommendation: for arable margins, plan two well-spaced visits to improve accuracy.

### Hedge diversity and boundary descriptors
- Hedge diversity plots showed a notable tendency to overlook woody elements within the hedge, contributing to higher-than-expected omissions.
- Total hedge diversity codes recorded augmented overall species counts, reflecting the importance of thorough hedge component recording.

### Overall ordination and bias
- DECORANA axis scores for CS2000 vs QA showed no directional bias (mean axis scores not significantly different overall).
- When data were pooled by landclass (LC, LG, MA, UP), there was no significant time-by-landclass bias in axis positions.
- No single dominant cause for discrepancies; issues clustered around plot location/orientation, species recording efficiency (including mis-identifications and overlooked species), and inconsistencies in cover value assignments.

## Implications for Data Stewardship

- Data quality generally robust for mapping and coding of primary habitat classes, with strong boundary and primary code concordance, enabling reliable long-term monitoring and change detection.
- Plot relocation and plot-position accuracy remain a key vulnerability; improved location protocols, mark-up accuracy, and possibly digital location tools are recommended to minimize mis-location errors.
- Species presence and frequency data are reasonably reliable but require ongoing training to reduce mis-identifications, particularly within grasses and difficult taxa; seasonal context should be explicitly captured in metadata.
- Change detection requires stronger procedures for recording and validating changes over time; a larger emphasis on change verification and cross-checking with base maps and prior strings is warranted.
- Arable margins and hedge-related data demand targeted QA and possibly augmented sampling to improve reliability.
- Documentation and metadata must clearly capture surveyor IDs, plot orientation, timing, and seasonal context to support reproducibility and data reuse.
- The QA protocol (Annex A/B) provides a repeatable framework for ongoing quality assurance and should be institutionalized to ensure consistent data quality across future CS cycles.

## Conclusion
- The Countryside Survey 2000 QA exercise demonstrates generally high concordance for mapping and most field-recording elements, with notable areas for improvement in plot relocation, change recording, and arable margin and hedge-related data.
- Data Stewards should incorporate these findings into governance practices: tighten relocation protocols, strengthen change verification, enhance species identification training, and ensure comprehensive metadata to support discovery, reuse, and accurate assessment of ecosystem change over time.
