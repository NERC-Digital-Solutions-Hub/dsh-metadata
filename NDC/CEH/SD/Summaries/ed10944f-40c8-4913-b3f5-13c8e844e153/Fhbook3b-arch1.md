# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- The document specifies standardized field data collection methods for CS2000, focusing on flora coding, sampling workflows, photography, data handling, and GPS procedures to enable robust time-series analyses across GB landscapes.

## Flora coding and species lists

- Abbreviations map to standardized species names (e.g., ferns, forbs/woody species, mosses/lichens) to ensure consistent data entry in field books and databases.
- The handbook provides extensive example mappings and codes for numerous taxa, supporting uniform tick-lists and hierarchical coding.
- A standard list of common plant species (approx. 200) is used, with provisions for unlisted species (Latin names) and selective recording of mosses/lichens.
- Coding supports both broad habitat interpretations and plot-level detail where applicable.

## Sampling types, aims and scope

- Three main sampling types conducted within CS2000:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna vulgaris (heathy vegetation) sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling (carried out by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff)
- The sampling program aims to establish spatially referenced baseline data to support soil quality assessment, biodiversity monitoring, and policy-relevant analyses.

## Soil sampling procedures

- Five replicate soil samples are collected per square in each 1 km square, using a standardized setup aligned with archival CS survey methods.
- In each X-plot (centered 2 x 2 m plots), three soil cores are taken using specified pipe types at defined locations relative to plot centers (e.g., 15 cm north of the north corner).
- Samples are processed and shipped to ITE Merlewood for laboratory analyses (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals, etc.), with rapid handling required for certain short-lived analyses.
- Equipment lists and packaging protocols specify what to include in envelopes, labels, and post-shipping arrangements to ensure traceability and sample integrity.

## Calluna sampling

- Within areas where Calluna vulgaris occurs, random sampling targets current year growth (CYG) to assess foliar nitrogen and potential nitrogen deposition effects.
- 30–50 g of CYG shoots are collected from multiple Calluna plants per square, labeled, dried/air-dried as needed, and mailed to ITE Merlewood in provided envelopes for later analysis.

## Freshwater sampling

- Freshwater sampling is conducted by trained IFE personnel in coordination with CS2000 coordinators, scheduled so as not to conflict with field survey work.

## Equipment, logistics and field integrity

- Equipment and safety gear are distributed to field teams, with responsibilities for maintenance and damage reporting clearly defined.
- Envelopes, bags, pipes, and other sampling materials are serialized and organized to match square and plot identifiers for traceability.
- Access to sites, time management, and sample transport are structured to minimize bias and maintain data quality.

## Photography guidelines

- A camera is provided per team, with a stock of film for documentation.
- Plot photographs must include square and plot identifiers, with reference features that are obvious, permanent, and visible in future visits.
- Photo composition aims to show the plot clearly while minimizing excessive sky and ensuring marker boards and reference features are legible.

## Procedures after survey

- After daily surveying, data sheets should be reviewed to ensure no features are omitted; transcription of data to new maps is discouraged unless necessary due to damage.
- FABs (Field Assessment Books) and samples should be transported back to ITE stations as soon as possible to preserve data integrity.

## Annex 1: Collecting GPS data

- Step-by-step guidance covers battery power, satellite connections (minimum four satellites; PDOP ideally below 6), stationary vs moving logging, file naming, data rate, and feature naming.
- Each plot or feature requires a unique data file name (e.g., 501X4.PSE) incorporating square and plot identifiers.
- Procedures address handling obstructions, almanac updates, and how to start/stop logging, with emphasis on obtaining accurate, well-documented spatial data.

## Data codes, references and metadata practices

- The handbook outlines attribute references and coding schemes to quickly locate plot identifiers and associated codes.
- Ensures consistent metadata capture across plots, features, and sampling events to facilitate reliable data integration and downstream analyses.
