# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- Purpose: quantify consistency and reliability of the Countryside 2000 field programme (QA of data quality).
- Scope: QA on 38 of 519 squares, with one quarter of each square resurveyed; 234 species plots across nine plot types.
- Focus areas: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, percentage cover estimates, direction bias, comparability with CS1990, land-use mapping accuracy, and changes in land cover.

## Methods (Summary)
- Design: replication of field procedures to assess reliability; use of original sketches, photographs, and buried plates to relocate plots eight years later.
- Plot types: seven main CS2000 plot types (quadrats and linear plots, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, etc.).
- Data elements examined: plot relocation success, species records, cover estimates, land-cover and boundary coding, hedge/wall features, and recorded land-use changes.
- Annex B details dates and efficiency measures; comparison with CS1990 QA methodology.

## Key Findings

### Plot Relocation
- Relocation success: 86.7% of full searches relocated; 60% precisely relocated; ~25% relocated but not precisely; ~15% not adequately relocated.
- Timeframe comparison: eight-year relocation similarly feasible as 12 months after; 1991 QA of CS1990 reported 87.1% relocation.
- Plate/plot recovery: 69.3% of plates recovered by assessors; overall potential recovery up to ~40–45% when counting approximate relocations.
- Implications: robust relocation is possible but prone to occasional misplacements; new plates often created, complicating future re-surveys.

### Species Concordance and Recording Accuracy
- Overall accuracy: ~73% concordance at time of QA; 71% of records confirmed by assessors; ~2% non-concordances due to real changes (management/seasonality).
- Change in species counts: mean number of species per plot higher in QA (CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4).
- Major error sources: mis-identifications (especially among grasses), overlooked species, and plot location/orientation errors.
- Seasonal effects: some discrepancies attributed to seasonality, particularly for certain grasses and annuals.

### Vegetation Cover
- General agreement: cover estimates for principal species largely matched between CS2000 and QA.
- Notable differences: several grasses showed significant differences in cover (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum); other species showed non-significant differences.
- Cover consistency: overall pattern indicates reasonable agreement, with some species exhibiting systematic biases in coding.

### Change Direction and Ordination (DECORANA)
- Axis shift: overall axis 1 shift was not significant; no directional bias detected when data were pooled by plot type and land class.
- Individual plot-type variations: some differences observed, but not indicative of a systematic survey-to-QA bias.
- Interpretation: changes observed between times largely reflect real variation plus recording errors rather than a directional artifact.

### Land-Cover Mapping
- Primary land-cover codes: high concordance; overall primary land-cover agreement ~87.5% (including ~77.4% for BAP codes).
- Primary boundary codes: strong concordance; overall boundary concordance ~85%, code concordance ~92%.
- Boundary features: lower concordance (~67.5%) for hedge/wall codes; hedge shape coding (374–380) had limited success; many hedges not coded or misinterpreted.
- Boundaries: stockproof height and condition generally well captured; some discrepancies in boundary height and wall coding.
- Change since 1990: alignment and coding of boundaries and land-use changes improved but remained imperfect; mis-match often due to boundary features no longer present or changes in management.

### Change in Land Use
- Change concordance: 51.4% overall; 33.9% of changes not noted by CS2000; 14.7% changes noted but not substantiated by assessors.
- Implication: substantial proportion of eight-year changes are missed or misrepresented by the CS2000 data; plot data may provide more reliable change signals but require rigorous capture and validation.

### Arable Plots
- Sample size: only five arable plots; concordance was extremely poor.
- Seasonal and identification challenges: arable margins highly variable; recommendations include multiple visits to capture seasonal variation more reliably.

## Implications for Data Leaders

- Data quality and time-series integrity
  - Robust QA processes are essential for long-running data programmes; ensure traceability of plots over time and clear documentation of relocation outcomes.
  - Maintain rigorous metadata on plot location, orientation, and changes to support longitudinal analyses.

- Standards and metadata
  - Standardize land-cover, boundary, and hedge/wall coding; ensure compatibility with prior surveys (CS1990) and clear documentation of new codes.
  - Capture and record changes explicitly, with justification and confidence levels; ensure changes are verifiable against field notes and imagery.

- Data architecture and governance
  - Invest in stable, durable plotting markers or improved relocation protocols to minimize mis-location/orientation errors.
  - Develop governance dashboards to monitor QA metrics (relocation success, concordance rates, change detection) across time and scale.

- Change detection and interpretability
  - Recognize that changes between time points are challenging to capture accurately; implement systematic change-capture workflows and cross-validation with multiple data sources.

- Operational guidance for field programmes
  - Enhance training focused on key error sources (plant ID for grasses, accurate plotting, consistent cover estimation).
  - Improve data collection tools to reduce omissions (e.g., hedge/wall coding, boundary attributes, and stockproofing status).
  - Plan for additional field visits in arable margin contexts to mitigate seasonal variability.

## Recommendations

- Improve plot relocation reliability
  - Use stable markers, validated sketch maps, and standardized relocation procedures to reduce mis-location/orientation errors.
- Strengthen taxonomic identification
  - Target grasses and commonly confused taxa with enhanced keys and reference materials; reinforce consistency across survey and QA teams.
- Expand arable margin sampling
  - Schedule multiple, well-spaced visits to account for seasonal dynamics and improve concordance.
- Enhance change-capture protocols
  - Implement explicit change codes and require corroborating evidence (field notes, photos) to validate observed changes.
- Refine coding systems and metadata
  - Simplify and harmonize land-cover, BAP, boundary, and hedge codes; maintain backward compatibility with CS1990 while adopting necessary improvements.
- Leverage QA insights for future survey design
  - Use identified error sources to inform survey design, sampling intensity, and data-system improvements; ensure QA metrics are embedded in data pipelines for ongoing quality assurance.
