# Elemental and isotopic data of a series of timed exchange experiments between clay, mineral water and seawater NERC Grant NE/T007214/1

- Study focus: Elemental and isotopic data from timed exchange experiments among clay, mineral water, and seawater; key elements are Sr, Mg, and Ca, with Sr and Mg isotopic analyses.

- Location and instrumentation:
  - Elemental measurements by ICP-OES (Agilent 5100) at the University of Cambridge.
  - Sr and Mg isotopic measurements by MC-ICP-MS (Thermo Neptune Plus) at the University of Cambridge.

- Elemental data (Sr, Mg, Ca):
  - Method: ICP-OES with matrix-matched synthetic standards spanning the sample concentration ranges.
  - Matrix considerations: 
    - Water-based matrix: external standard reference materials SPS-SW2 and SLRS-6; within ±5% of certified values.
    - Ammonium chloride matrix: SPS-SW2, SLRS-6, and a 3.2 BCR-2 (SCO-013a) LiBOx standard; values better than ±10% of certified values.
  - Purpose: Provide accurate elemental concentrations across sample sets for monitoring exchange experiments.

- Strontium isotope data (87Sr/86Sr and d88/86Sr):
  - Method: Radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr and stable d88/86Sr measured by MC-ICP-MS (Thermo Neptune Plus) using a Forced Mass Bias Zr-dope EEN technique.
  - Error analysis: Monte-Carlo simulation to evaluate total data reduction errors; n=1000 random sets generated from mean internal precision (2SE) to derive true isotope ratios and total errors.
  - Standards and reference values:
    - IAPSO Standard seawater: 87Sr/86Sr = 0.709186 ± 0.000008 (2SD, n=9).
    - d88/86Sr value: 0.389 ± 0.06 (2SD, n=9).
  - Notes: Total error assessment incorporates analytical uncertainty for each isotope ratio.

- Magnesium isotope data (d26/24Mg and d25/24Mg):
  - Method: MC-ICP-MS (Thermo Neptune Plus) with Sample-Standard Bracketing.
  - Error analysis: Two standard deviations calculated from at least three repeat analyses per sample.
  - Standards and performance:
    - Repeat analyses of IAPSO standard seawater and Cam1 show results within published values.
    - d26/24Mg:
      - IAPSO: -0.79 ± 0.07 (2SD, n=5).
      - Cam1: -2.59 ± 0.12 (2SD, n=3).
    - d25/24Mg:
      - IAPSO: -0.41 ± 0.05 (2SD, n=5).
      - Cam1: -1.33 ± 0.09 (2SD, n=3).

- Data handling and outputs:
  - Quality assurance: verification against standard materials, matrix-specific calibration, and replicated measurements to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.
  - Data formatting: outputs designed for clear presentation (e.g., reports, charts) and consistent with standard monitoring practices.
  - Data management: datasets are prepared for storage and upload to appropriate data portals to support ongoing environmental monitoring and policy assessment.
