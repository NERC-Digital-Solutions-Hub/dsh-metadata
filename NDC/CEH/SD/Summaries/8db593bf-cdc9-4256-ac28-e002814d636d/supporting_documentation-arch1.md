# Elemental and isotopic data of a series of timed exchange experiments between clay, mineral water and seawater

## Overview
- Presents elemental and isotopic data from timed exchange experiments involving clay, mineral water, and seawater.
- Data types include elemental concentrations (Sr, Mg, Ca) and isotopic ratios (Sr and Mg isotopes).
- Analyses were conducted at the University of Cambridge using high-precision ICP-OES and MC-ICP-MS instruments.
- Emphasis on quality control, standardization, and rigorous uncertainty estimation (including Monte Carlo propagation for Sr isotopes).

## Elemental data (Sr, Mg, Ca)
- Technique: ICP-OES (Agilent 5100) at University of Cambridge.
- Calibration: matrix-matched synthetic standards spanning sample concentration ranges.
- Quality controls:
  - External standards for water-based matrices: SPS-SW2 and SLRS-6; analyses within ±5% of certified values.
  - For ammonium chloride matrix: SPS-SW2, SLRS-6, and a 3.2 BCR-2 (SCO-013a) LiBOx standard; results better than ±10% of certified values.
- Analytes: Strontium (Sr), Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca).

## Strontium isotope data (87Sr/86Sr, d88/86Sr)
- Technique: MC-ICP-MS (Thermo Neptune Plus) with Forced Mass Bias Zr-doped EEN.
- Data reduction: Monte Carlo simulation to propagate errors.
  - For each variable, 1000 random numbers generated from the mean internal precision (2SE) of measured isotope ratios.
  - Across many simulated sets, true isotope ratios and total errors are derived.
- Reference materials and standards:
  - IAPSO Standard seawater used as a reference standard (87Sr/86Sr values provided; example reference value: 0.709186 ± 0.000008 2SD, n=9).
  - Total error assessment performed via the Monte Carlo approach to account for analytical uncertainties in each measured ratio.

## Magnesium isotope data (d26/24Mg, d25/24Mg)
- Technique: MC-ICP-MS (Thermo Neptune Plus) with Sample-Standard-Bracketing.
- Repeat analyses: At least three repeat analyses per sample; standard deviations computed from repeats.
- Quality checks:
  - Repeat analyses of IAPSO standard seawater and Cam1 are within the range of previously published results.
- Reported Mg isotopic values (examples from the dataset):
  - d26/24Mg: -0.79 ± 0.07 (2SD, n=5)
  - d25/24Mg: -2.59 ± 0.12 (2SD, n=3)
  - Additional set:
    - d26/24Mg: -0.41 ± 0.05 (2SD, n=5)
    - d25/24Mg: -1.33 ± 0.09 (2SD, n=3)

## Data quality and uncertainty
- Uncertainty handling:
  - Elemental data: reported against matrix-specific external standards with clear accuracy bands (±5% for water matrices; ±10% for ammonium chloride matrices).
  - Isotopic data: Monte Carlo-based total error assessment for Sr isotopes; standard isotopic values and repeat analyses used to validate magnesium isotopes.
- Standards and traceability:
  - Use of matrix-matched standards and reference materials (SPS-SW2, SLRS-6, BCR-2, IAPSO seawater) to ensure accuracy and comparability.
- Documentation of analytical approach:
  - Detailed description of instruments, calibration, cleaning/processing steps, and replication to enable traceability and reproducibility.
