# Elemental and isotopic data of a series of timed exchange experiments between clay, mineral water and seawater NERC Grant NE/T007214/1

## Overview of the data
- Elemental data for Sr, Mg, and Ca analyzed by ICP-OES on an Agilent 5100 at the University of Cambridge.
- Isotopic data for radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr and stable d88/86Sr measured by MC-ICP-MS (Thermo Neptune Plus) at the University of Cambridge.
- Magnesium isotopes (d26/24Mg and d25/24Mg) measured by MC-ICP-MS with a Sample-Standard-Bracketing approach.
- Data produced include elemental concentrations and isotope ratios with associated uncertainties, enabling interpretation of timed exchange experiments between clay, mineral water, and seawater.

## Methods and data types
- Elemental data
  - Technique: ICP-OES (Agilent 5100).
  - Matrices: water-based and ammonium chloride-based.
  - Calibration: matrix-matched synthetic standards spanning sample concentration ranges.
  - Standards: SPS-SW2 and SLRS-6 for water-based matrix; SPS-SW2, SLRS-6, and a 3.2 BCR-2 (SCO-013a) LiBOx standard for ammonium chloride matrix.
- Isotopic data
  - 87Sr/86Sr and d88/86Sr measured by MC-ICP-MS using Forced Mass Bias Zr-dope EEN technique.
  - Standards: IAPSO Standard Seawater for reference values.
  - Data processing: Monte-Carlo simulation to evaluate total errors, accounting for analytical uncertainty of each isotope ratio.
  - Simulation details: 1000 random draws based on mean internal precision (2SE) to obtain true isotope ratios and total errors; n values reported for each variable.
- Magnesium isotopes
  - d26/24Mg and d25/24Mg measured by MC-ICP-MS with wave-like repeat analyses to establish precision.
  - Standards and repeats: repeat analyses of IAPSO seawater and Cam1; results compared to published values.
  - Uncertainty calculation: two standard deviations from at least three repeat analyses per sample.

## Quality assurance, uncertainties, and validation
- External standard performance
  - Elemental measurements in water-based matrix: within ±5% of certified values.
  - Elemental measurements in ammonium chloride matrix: within ±10% of certified values.
- Isotopic uncertainties
  - 87Sr/86Sr and d88/86Sr uncertainties derived from Monte-Carlo total-error assessment.
  - Mg isotopes uncertainties derived from multiple repeats, with reported 2SD values.
- Replicates and reporting
  - Representative isotope ratio values provided with n = number of analyses; 2SD (two standard deviations) used for reporting variability.

## Representative data products and outputs
- Elemental data: concentrations of Sr, Mg, and Ca in the samples with associated measurement uncertainties (calibrated against matrix-matched standards).
- Isotopic data: 87Sr/86Sr and d88/86Sr isotope ratios with total uncertainties via Monte Carlo; matrices and calibration described.
- Magnesium isotopes: d26/24Mg and d25/24Mg with 2SD uncertainties from multiple repeats.
- Reference standards and values reported (e.g., IAPSO standard seawater values and acceptance ranges).

## Context, interpretation, and usage
- Purpose: to provide robust elemental and isotopic data from timed exchange experiments for interpretation of exchange processes between clay, mineral water, and seawater.
