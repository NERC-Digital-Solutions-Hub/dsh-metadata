# Elemental and isotopic data of a series of timed exchange experiments between clay, mineral water and seawater NERC Grant NE/T007214/1

- This document reports coordinated elemental and isotopic measurements from timed exchange experiments involving clay, mineral water, and seawater. It includes concentration data for Sr, Mg, and Ca, and isotope data for Sr and Mg, with detailed methods, standards, and uncertainty assessments.

## Elemental data (Sr, Mg, Ca)

- Measured by ICP-OES (Agilent 5100) at the University of Cambridge.
- Calibration: matrix-matched synthetic standards spanning the sample concentration ranges.
- Data quality against external references:
  - Water-based matrix: SPS-SW2 and SLRS-6 within ±5% of certified values.
  - Ammonium chloride-based matrix: SPS-SW2, SLRS-6, and a 3.2 BCR-2 standard better than ±10% of certified values.
- Data scope: elemental concentrations for Sr, Mg, and Ca.
- Error reporting: method errors noted for HNO3 matrix and NH4Cl matrix.

## Strontium isotope data (87Sr/86Sr and d88/86Sr)

- Measured by MC-ICP-MS (Thermo Neptune Plus) at Cambridge.
- Instrumental technique: Forced Mass Bias Zr-dope EEN.
- Uncertainty assessment:
  - Monte-Carlo simulation to propagate total errors in data reduction.
  - For each variable, 1000 random numbers (based on mean internal precision, 2SE) are generated to derive true isotope ratios and total errors.
- Standards and references:
  - IAPSO standard seawater value used: 0.709186 ± 0.000008 (2SD, n=9).
  - Reported isotope data include a value 0.389 ± 0.06 (2SD, n=9), as part of the total error characterization.
- Replication:
  - Data reductions and errors quantified across multiple sets generated via Monte Carlo (n=1000 per variable).

## Magnesium isotope data (d26/24Mg and d25/24Mg)

- Measured by MC-ICP-MS (Thermo Neptune Plus) at Cambridge.
- Analytical approach: Sample-Standard Bracketing.
- Replicates and uncertainty:
  - Two standard deviations calculated from at least three repeat analyses per sample.
- Standards and references:
  - Repeated analyses of IAPSO standard seawater and Cam1 show results consistent with published values:
    - For d26/24Mg: -0.79 ± 0.07 (2SD, n=5); -0.41 ± 0.05 (2SD, n=5).
    - For d25/24Mg: -2.59 ± 0.12 (2SD, n=3); -1.33 ± 0.09 (2SD, n=3).
- Data scope: Mg isotopic compositions (d26/24Mg and d25/24Mg) with associated uncertainties.
