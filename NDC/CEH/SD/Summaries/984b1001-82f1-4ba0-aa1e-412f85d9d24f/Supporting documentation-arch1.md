# Impact of grassland management on biomass production and nutritional quality, invertebrate communities, and soil health, from an experimental site in Berkshire, UK.

## Overview
- Multi-year, field-scale study (2009–2012) at Warfield, Berkshire, UK examining how seed mix, management type, management intensity, and seed bed cultivation affect grassland productivity, forage quality, pollinator communities, predatory beetles, and soil health.
- Factorial, randomised split-split-split-plot design across four blocks with 96 plots (~875 m2 each).
- No inorganic fertilizer applied during the experiment.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Seed treatments (whole-plot level):
  - G: grass-only mix
  - GL: grass & legume mix
  - GLF: grass, legume & forb mix
- Cultivation (seed bed establishment) treatments:
  - Deep ploughing
  - Minimum tillage (non-inversion)
- Management (split-plot):
  - Grazing vs cutting for silage (to 10 cm)
- Management intensity (split-split-plot):
  - Intensive (grazing May–Oct or May & Aug cuts)
  - Extensive (grazing with a June–Aug pause or a single May cut)
- Key context:
  - 24 treatment levels across 96 plots
  - Four blocks; blocks 1–4
  - Floristically poor baseline sward dominated by Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens
  - Seed mixtures include specified grasses, legumes, and forbs with defined sowing rates

## Data collected and variables

- Biomass production and nutritional quality
  - Dry matter yield (biomass) measured yearly (2009–2012) on cut plots
  - Herbage nitrogen content (%N) measured from the first May cut
- Invertebrate communities
  - Pollinators: abundance and species richness
    - Fixed 20 m x 2 m transects; surveys in May (pre-cut), late July, and early August
    - Taxonomic resolution: butterflies to species; Apis mellifera; Bombus spp. (multiple species); solitary bees; hoverflies
  - Predatory beetles: abundance, species richness, biomass
    - Vortis suction sampling (June and September); 55 ten-second suctions per plot-year
    - Beetles identified to species; classified as predatory or phytophagous
- Soil health
  - Bulk density (0–10 cm) measured in 2009, 2010, 2012
  - Total soil nitrogen (%N) and total soil carbon (%C) measured from sub-samples (0–10 cm horizon) in same years
- Seed mixtures (composition)
  - Detailed species lists and sowing rates for grasses (G), grasses with legumes (GL), and grasses with legumes and forbs (GLF)

## Data files and metadata
- Four CSV data files:
  - rawdata_biomass production and quality.csv
    - Contains plot-level measurements of dry matter yield and %N for cut plots across 2009–2012
  - rawdata_invertebrates.csv
    - Contains plot-level pollinator abundance/species richness and predatory beetle abundance/species richness/biomass across 2009–2012
  - rawdata_soil_bulkdensity.csv
    - Contains bulk density measurements (0–10 cm) by plot, seed treatment, management, intensity, cultivation, year
  - rawdata_soil_nitrogen and carbon.csv
    - Contains total nitrogen and total carbon measurements by plot, seed treatment, management, intensity, cultivation, year
- Metadata describes column headings, units, and meanings; provides context for each variable and data collection method
- Seed mixture table (Table 1) details species composition and sowing rates for G, GL, and GLF

## Methods and quality
- Field procedures:
  - Cutting performed with a 3 m mower, 10 cm residue height
  - Dry matter yield calculated from weighed 5 kg subsample and oven-dried mass
  - Nitrogen content measured with appropriate laboratory equipment
  - Pollinator surveys followed established protocols for timing and weather conditions
  - Beetle sampling via standardized suction method
  - Soil samples prepared and analyzed using established soil science protocols
- Data quality:
  - Surveys and lab analyses conducted by trained personnel
  - Standardised data collection forms and procedures
  - Anomaly checks performed to ensure data quality

## Potential analyses and usage
- Examine main effects and interactions of seed mix, management type, intensity, and cultivation on:
  - Biomass yield and forage quality
  - Pollinator abundance and diversity
  - Predatory beetle communities and biomass
  - Soil bulk density, total nitrogen, and total carbon
- Explore year-to-year trends and potential lag effects across 2009–2012
- Investigate relationships between aboveground plant management practices, biodiversity metrics, and soil health across blocks and plots
- Use dataset for meta-analyses or comparative studies on grassland management and ecosystem services
