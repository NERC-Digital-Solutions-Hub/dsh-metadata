# Impact of grassland management on biomass production and nutritional quality, invertebrate communities, and soil health, from an experimental site in Berkshire, UK.

## Overview
- Describes how different grassland management techniques affect biomass production, nutritional quality, pollinator and predatory beetle communities, and soil health.
- Location: Warfield, Berkshire, UK; field-scale, randomised block experiment conducted 2009–2012; Defra-funded project BD1466.
- Data package comprises four CSV files with accompanying metadata and references to related publications.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Design: field-scale, multifactorial, randomised split-split-split-plot across four blocks; 24 treatment levels over 96 plots (~875 m2 each).
- Seed treatments (whole-plot level):
  - G: grass mix of five grasses
  - GL: grass + legumes (five grasses + seven legumes)
  - GLF: grass + legumes + forbs
- Seed bed cultivation (CULTIVATION): Deep ploughing vs minimum tillage (non-inversion).
- Management (MANAGEMENT): Grazing vs cutting (silage to 10 cm).
- Management intensity (INTENSITY): Intensive (grazing May–Oct or cuts in May/Aug) vs Extensive (grazing as before with June–Aug suspension or one May cut).
- Fertiliser: No inorganic fertilisers used.
- Seed rates and species compositions detailed in Table 1 (seed mixes for grasses, legumes, and forbs).
- Focused measurements across treatments include biomass yield, herbage nitrogen content, pollinator and beetle communities, and soil properties.

## Data files and contents
- four CSV files:
  - rawdata_biomass production and quality.csv: yearly measurements (2009–2012) of dry matter yield and herbage nitrogen (%) for 48 plots under cutting management.
  - rawdata_invertebrates.csv: pollinator abundance and species richness; predatory beetle biomass, abundance, and species richness; across 96 plots.
  - rawdata_soil_bulkdensity.csv: soil bulk density (0–10 cm) measured in 2009, 2010, 2012 for plots under intensive management.
  - rawdata_soil_nitrogen and carbon.csv: total soil nitrogen and carbon (0–10 cm carbon/nitrogen context separate) measured in the same years.
- common fields across files include: Plot, Seed, Management, Intensity, Cultivation, Block, Year (yr2009–yr2012), with specific measurement columns per file.

## Data collection methods
- Biomass and quality:
  - Cutting samples collected with a 3 m mower; 5 m strip weighed; 0.5 kg homogenous sample dried at 80°C to determine dry matter yield; May nitrogen (%N) determined with LECO equipment.
- Pollinators:
  - Two fixed 20 m x 2 m transects per plot; surveys three times per year (2009–2012) from 10:00–16:00; identification of butterflies to species; bees (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp.), hoverflies; derived total pollinator abundance and species richness.
- Predatory beetles:
  - Vortis suction sampler used (June and September); 55 suction samples per plot per year; beetles identified to species and categorized as predatory or phytophagous; biomass derived from length–mass relationships.
- Soil properties:
  - Bulk density assessed in 0–10 cm horizon using five cores per plot (2009, 2010, 2012); additional cores for nitrogen and carbon analyses from the same plots; standard protocols followed for volume, drying, and analyses.

## Data governance, quality, and provenance
- Data collected by trained personnel following standardized field and laboratory protocols; field and lab forms used for data capture.
- Data checked for anomalous entries; provenance maintained through documented methods and references.
- Related publications listed for context and reuse (e.g., papers on enhancing pollinators and beetle communities in intensive grasslands).

## Supplemental information and references

- Provisions for understanding methodology and data interpretation are included in the methods and supporting documentation.

## Data access and reuse considerations for Data Stewards
- Structure: clearly defined per-plot measurements across four years; multilevel experimental design supports cross-treatment comparisons and ecosystem service assessment.
- Metadata-rich: explicit variable definitions (Seed, Management, Intensity, Cultivation, Block, Year) and detailed measurement protocols facilitate data discovery, harmonisation, and reuse.
- Limitations and scope:
  - No fertiliser inputs; intensive vs extensive management contrasts may influence transferability to different systems.
  - Data span 2009–2012; consider temporal context when integrating with newer datasets.
- Provenance and licensing context:
  - Funded Defra project with published associated papers; dataset includes references to supplemental materials and methodologies for governance and quality assurance.
