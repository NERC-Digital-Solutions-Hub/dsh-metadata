# Impact of grassland management on biomass production and nutritional quality, invertebrate communities, and soil health, from an experimental site in Berkshire, UK.

## Overview
- Describes a field-scale experiment (2009–2012) assessing how grassland management affects biomass production, nutritional quality, pollinator communities, predatory beetles, and soil health.
- Aimed at informing ecosystem service provision and land-management policy.

## Study site and experimental design
- Location: agriculturally improved grass ley in Warfield, Berkshire, UK.
- Experimental design: randomised, multifactorial split-split-split-plot with four blocks; 24 treatment levels across 96 plots (~875 m2 each).
- Treatments represented by four hierarchies:
  - Seed mix (SEED): Grass only (G), Grass+Legume (GL), Grass+Legume+Forbs (GLF).
  - Management (MANAGEMENT): Grazing vs Cutting for silage.
  - Intensity (INTENSITY): Intensive vs Extensive.
  - Seed bed cultivation (CULTIVATION): Deep ploughing vs Minimum tillage (non-inversion).
- Seed bed establishment: autumn 2008; no inorganic fertilizer used.
- Measurements span 2009–2012.

## Treatments and seed mixes
- Seed mixtures:
  - G: five grasses, higher agronomic performance under low input.
  - GL: G plus seven legumes.
  - GLF: GL plus six forbs.
- Grass species include Alopecurus pratensis, Dactylis glomerata, Festuca pratensis, Lolium perenne, Phleum pratensis, among others.
- Seed rates and approximate costs provided for each mix.
- Cultivation and management levels created a hierarchical experimental structure to test effects of cultivation, management type, and management intensity.

## Measurements and data collection
- Biomass production and quality:
  - Dry matter yield and herbage nitrogen content (%N) measured annually (2009–2012) on cut plots.
  - Method: standard grassland sampling with a mower, subsampling, oven-drying, and conversion to yield; nitrogen analysis with LECO equipment.
- Pollinator surveys:
  - Two fixed 20 m x 2 m transects per plot; three surveying periods yearly (2009–2012) at distinct times (pre-cut, post-cut, pre-final cut).
  - Taxonomic resolution: butterflies to species; Apis mellifera; Bombus spp. to species; hoverflies; total pollinator abundance and species richness derived.
- Predatory beetle sampling:
  - Vortis suction sampler used in June and September (2009–2012); 55 suction samples per plot; specimens identified to species; categorized as predatory or phytophagous.
  - Abundance, species richness, and biomass computed (biomass from length–mass relationships).
- Soil assessments:
  - Bulk density measured in 0–10 cm horizon for plots under intensive management (INTENSITY) in 2009, 2010, 2012.
  - Soil samples for total nitrogen (%N) and total carbon (%C) analyzed in the same years.
  - Additional cores collected for comprehensive soil chemistry.
- Data collection adhered to standardized protocols; trained surveyors and laboratory staff; data checked for anomalies.
