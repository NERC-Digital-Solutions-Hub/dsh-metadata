# Contextual metadata for Isle of May Breeding Success 1982-2012 dataset

- Purpose: describes a dataset of calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species at Isle of May (East coast Scotland), with annual values and sample sizes, and outlines the data collection, handling, and monitoring methods used to obtain the data.
- Content overview:
  - Dataset structure: for each year (1982-2012) a single row with six breeding success (BS) values (one per species) and six corresponding active nests counts.
  - Species included: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake, and northern fulmar.
  - Access and usage: free to use under a CEH data licence; user is encouraged to contact CEH staff before publication.

- Background and provenance:
  - Origin: Isle of May National Nature Reserve seabird studies (IMLOTS) within the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee monitoring programme.
  - Standardisation: methods for calculating breeding success standardized from 1987; data collected as part of long-term monitoring.
  - Data management: field data collected on notebooks and forms, transcribed to spreadsheets, cross-checked against field observations; archived at CEH Edinburgh.

- Field data handling and quality control:
  - Field staff: trained, using defined protocols.
  - Data workflows: notebooks and field sheets transcribed to spreadsheets; checks against field records to identify inconsistencies.
  - Quality control: quality-controlled databases; Access databases with error-checking queries.
  - Data governance: results and reports vetted within CEH management; support for publishing in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.

- Sampling design and species-specific monitoring details (overview):
  - Puffin: monitoring since 1973; 4 plots standardized from 1982; sampling scaled with population fluctuations.
  - Guillemot and Razorbill: monitoring began in 1982; plots increased over time to reflect population changes.
  - Shag: monitoring since 1987; initial 14 plots, expanded in 1996 to boost sample size.
  - Kittiwake: monitoring since 1987; started with 15 plots; expansions in 2004-2005 due to population changes.
  - Fulmar: monitoring since 1987; 10 plots.

- Appendix: productivity-monitoring methods by species (key elements)
  - Fulmar productivity-monitoring (nest-site mapping):
    - Plot design: 30–50 nest-sites per plot; 3–5 plots; same plots each year.
    - Data capture: photograph plots with overlays; mark and number nest-sites.
    - Fieldwork: three visits in late May/early June; record status (egg, incubating, etc.).
    - Data handling: careful matching of nest-sites across dates; note changes in viewing position.
    - Calculation: mean number of young fledged per occupied site; colony production = fledged young / nests incubating.
  - Shag productivity-monitoring:
    - Plot size: 10–30 nests per plot; aim for 3–5 plots; same plots annually.
    - Data capture: photograph plots; overlay with nest positions; visit every 7–10 days from mid-April.
    - Fieldwork: record nest state, contents, and incubation/brooding status; watch for large young.
    - Calculation: colony productivity = number of fledged young / nests incubating.
  - Kittiwake productivity-monitoring:
    - Plot design: 50–100 nests per plot; aim for 50–70 nests per photographic print; multiple plots.
    - Data capture: photograph plots in May; create overlays; mark incubating or attended nests.
    - Fieldwork: second and later visits to re-check nests; record chick age categories after first chick appears.
    - Calculation: after chick emergence, estimate fledging outcomes; colony productivity = fledged / completed nests.
  - Guillemot productivity-monitoring:
    - Plot design: several plots with at least 50 breeding pairs each.
    - Data capture: incubating-stage photographs; mark active sites; multiple daily visits; note bridled vs unbridled pairs.
    - Fieldwork: record eggs laid, lost, relaid, hatched, and chicks without an adult.
    - Calculation: productivity = total active sites (egg/chick/incubating) plus regular inactive sites; assume 15+ day-old chicks that disappear have fledged.
  - Puffin productivity-monitoring:
    - Timing: checks after peak laying (early May is ideal).
    - Plot design: four plots of 50+ burrows; burrows dispersed across colony.
    - Data capture: probe burrows with sticks to detect incubating birds; re-check by early July.
    - Fieldwork: determine success via chick presence, latrine, or moulted down; note predation or flooding.
    - Calculation: success = number of chicks present / number of burrows re-found (burrows not re-found excluded).
