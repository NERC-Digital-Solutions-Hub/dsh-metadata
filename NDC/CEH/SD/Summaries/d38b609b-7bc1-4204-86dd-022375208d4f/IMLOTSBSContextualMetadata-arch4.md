# Contextual metadata for Isle of May Breeding Success 1982-2012 dataset

- The dataset provides calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species from Isle of May, Scotland, with annual data rows.
- Species covered: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill (since 1982 for three species), European shag, black-legged kittiwake, and northern fulmar (these three since 1987).
- Each year includes six columns of breeding success rates (BS) and six columns for the number of active nests used to calculate those rates.
- Data access is free but governed by a CEH data licence; users, especially publishers, are advised to contact CEH staff prior to use.

## Context and provenance

- Part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), linked to the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee’s seabird monitoring program.
- Methods for calculating breeding success have been consistent since seabird monitoring standardised in 1987.
- Fieldwork conducted by trained staff following defined protocols; data recorded in notebooks and field sheets, transcribed to spreadsheets, and backed up to CEH directories.
- All data and notes archived at CEH Edinburgh; quality control and error checking implemented at source.
- Data management includes vetting of results, alignment with contracted deliverables, and encouragement of publication in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.

## Data structure and content

- Annual data: each year is a single row with six breeding success rates (per species) and six corresponding nest counts.
- Output integrity and reporting are subject to CEH management vetting and tracking.

## Data collection, methods, and quality assurance (high-level)

- Field protocols and data handling are designed to ensure data quality and consistency across years.
- Data are collected in the field, transcribed, checked for inconsistencies, and archived.
- Databases used are quality-controlled; Access databases include error-checking queries to verify and correct uncertain information at the field station.
- The dataset adheres to a documented data-manual approach, with routine checks and approvals before dissemination.

## Access, licensing, and reuse considerations

- The dataset is free to use under the CEH data licence.
- For publication or wider use, researchers are encouraged to contact CEH staff beforehand.
- Metadata and data lineage are clear: field methods, data handling, and QA processes are documented to support reproducibility.

## Appendices: Monitoring methods by species (key, high-level overview)

- Fulmar productivity-monitoring method
  - Use multiple study plots (30–50 nest-sites per plot; 3+ plots preferred; same plots yearly).
  - Photograph plots with overlays; map nest positions; three visits in late May/early June to determine incubation status.
  - Record nest state, contents, and presence of incubating birds; sample adjustments for difficult-to-detect sites.
  - Express colony production as mean fledged young per regularly occupied site.

- Shag productivity-monitoring method
  - Sample plots with 10–30 nests; aim for 3–5 plots; use annual plots.
  - Photograph plots; visits every 7–10 days from mid-April; record nest state, contents, and incubation/brooding.
  - Compute colony production as total young fledged divided by nests where birds were incubating.

- Kittiwake productivity-monitoring method
  - Identify plots of 50–100 nests; ideally 50–70 nests per photographic print.
  - Photograph during May; mark nests with birds incubating or attended.
  - Revisit to re-check and add new nests; flight-friendly plotting and detailed age/position notes.
  - Collected data yield productivity as fledged young divided by completed nests.

- Guillemot productivity-monitoring method
  - Select several study plots with a minimum of 50 breeding pairs per plot; random or representative selection.
  - Photograph incubating sites; repeat multiple visits daily during incubation and chick-rearing.
  - Define active sites (egg or chick or incubating adult); productivity is fledged Young / active sites (and some inactive but regular sites).

- Razorbill productivity-monitoring method
  - Similar to Guillemot: multiple plots with at least 10 breeding pairs; photograph and map active sites; frequent visits from incubation onward.
  - Productivity is fledged young divided by the number of active sites.

- Puffin productivity-monitoring method
  - Check a series of burrows after peak laying; four plots of 50+ burrows each.
  - Use probing sticks to detect incubating birds without disturbing eggs; re-check in early July to confirm chick presence.
  - Record evidence of predation or flooding; compute productivity as the number of chicks present divided by the total burrows where presence/absence of a chick was determined.

## Governance and usage notes for Data Leaders

- Emphasizes a long-term, standardized data collection framework across species, enabling cross-year comparability.
- Demonstrates importance of explicit metadata, detailed appendices describing methods, and archival practices for transparency and reuse.
- Highlights governance considerations: licensing, pre-publication liaison with data custodians, and alignment with customer/deliverables.
- Illustrates data lifecycle management: notebooks and field sheets, transcription to digital formats, QA checks, secure backups, and centralized archival at a data house (CEH Edinburgh).

## Key takeaways for data leadership

- Long-running, multi-species datasets benefit from standardized, well-documented methodologies and explicit data provenance.
- Robust data quality practices (error checking, archival, governance) are essential to ensure trust and reusability.
- Clear licensing, publication rights, and contact points facilitate responsible and collaborative data use.
- Appendices detailing species-specific monitoring protocols provide essential context for data interpretation and potential reuse in comparative analyses.
