# Contextual metadata for Isle of May Breeding Success 1982-2012 dataset

## Overview
- Dataset of calculated breeding success rates (BS) for six seabird species at Isle of May, Scotland, with annual data from 1982 to 2012.
- Species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake, and northern fulmar.
- Each year is a single row with six BS values and six corresponding active nests counts.
- Free to use under a standard CEH data licence; authors encourage contacting CEH staff before publication of results.

## Dataset structure and key variables
- Six species-specific breeding success rates (BS) per year.
- Six corresponding counts of active nests used to calculate BS.
- Data organization reflects long-term seabird monitoring as part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) within the JNCC seabird monitoring programme.

## Provenance, collection, and handling
- Background: Part of long-term seabird monitoring initiated in 1973; methods standardised from 1987 and documented in accompanying appendices.
- Field measurements conducted by trained staff following defined protocols; data captured in notebooks and field sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets.
- Quality checks: consistency checks performed on spreadsheets with field verification of potential errors; notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Databases: data quality controlled at source with error-checking queries in Access databases.
- Data handling and storage: all work governed by CEH management vetting; outputs align with customer deliverables and are suitable for peer-reviewed publication with customer approval.

## Quality, governance, and dissemination
- Data integrity and reporting are subject to CEH management oversight through sections leadership and finance administration.
- Encouraged dissemination of non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgement.
- Output focus includes facilitating self-service analysis via dashboards, reports, pivot tables, and charts; emphasis on improving data creation and re-use.

## Productivity-monitoring methods (by species)
Appendix extracts describe standardised, species-specific field methods used to derive productivity metrics. Key elements include plot selection, sampling intensity, and rules for defining fledging success.

- Fulmar productivity-monitoring method
  - Use 3–5 plots with 30–50 nest-sites each; map plots on photographs and overlay boundaries.
  - Three visits in late May/early June to record incubation and chick presence; avoid disturbing birds.
  - Express colony production as mean fledging per occupied plot; overall productivity as total fledged chicks divided by nests where incubation occurred.

- Shag productivity-monitoring method
  - 3–5 study plots; each plot 10–30 nests; photograph plots with nests visible.
  - Visits every 7–10 days from start of laying to chick fledging; record nest state and incubation/brooding status.
  - Colony productivity = fledged chicks divided by nests where birds were incubating.

- Kittiwake productivity-monitoring method
  - 50–100 nests across dispersed plots; photograph nests on nests during May.
  - Visits in late May and mid-June; mark nests with incubating birds, attended nests, and other site-holders.
  - Do not heavily estimate clutch size; productivity = fledged chicks divided by completed nests.

- Guillemot productivity-monitoring method
  - Five plots of ≥50 breeding pairs; photograph during incubation; map active sites from photographs.
  - Multiple visits per day from incubation through fledging; record egg laying, loss, relaying, hatching, and chick presence.
  - Productivity = total fledged chicks divided by active sites (egg or chick or incubating adults on consecutive checks).

- Razorbill productivity-monitoring method
  - Five plots; ≥10 breeding pairs each; photograph during incubation; map active sites.
  - Regular visits from incubation onset; record eggs, hatchings, and chick status.
  - Productivity = fledged chicks divided by active sites.

- Puffin productivity-monitoring method
  - Check burrows after peak laying; four plots of 50+ burrows.
  - Use probes to detect incubating birds; re-check when large chicks are present (early July) to confirm fledging.
  - Output: proportion of burrows with a chick present at checks; success expressed as chicks present divided by burrows checked.

## Appendix contents
- Appendix provides user-manual extracts detailing methods for each species, including plot selection, recording schemes, timing of visits, handling of nests and chicks, and calculations for productivity.

## Licensing and use
- Dataset is free to use under CEH data licence.
- Publication requires contacting CEH staff prior to use, especially for formal publication.
