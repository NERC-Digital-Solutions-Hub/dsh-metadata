# Contextual metadata for Isle of May Breeding Success 1982-2012 dataset

- Overview
  - Dataset of calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species from representative Isle of May colonies.
  - Each year is a single row with six columns for breeding success (BS) by species and six columns for the number of active nests used to calculate BS.
  - Time span: Puffin, Guillemot, Razorbill (since 1982); Shag, Kittiwake, Fulmar (since 1987).
  - Free to use under a standard CEH data licence; authors encourage contacting CEH staff before publication.

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), linked to JNCC’s seabird monitoring programme.
  - Methods have been standardised since 1987; dataset supports long-term seabird productivity monitoring.

- Data structure and content
  - Rows: one per year.
  - Columns: six species-specific breeding success rates (BS) and six corresponding active nest counts.
  - Species labels use common names with BS suffix; foundational data derived from field counts and nest observations.

- Provenance and data collection
  - Fieldwork conducted by trained staff using defined protocols.
  - Data captured in notebooks and field data sheets; transcribed to spreadsheets; backed up to CEH directories.
  - Data quality checks performed to resolve inconsistencies; notebooks/fieldsheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.

- Data quality, governance, and access
  - Databases quality-controlled at source; error-checking queries used in Access databases.
  - Outputs subject to management vetting and tracking within CEH (heads, programme directors, finance).
  - Encouragement to publish non-confidential scientific information with customer approval.
  - Licensing specifics and contact guidance provided to facilitate legitimate reuse.

- Documentation and methods (Appendix)
  - Appendix contains extracts from user manuals describing species-specific monitoring methods:
    - Puffin: burrow checks, plot selection, nest/site mapping, fledging calculations.
    - Shag: cliff/rock/boulder nesting plots, periodic checks, colony production calculation.
    - Kittiwake: plot-based nest monitoring, photographing, and fledging assessment.
    - Guillemot: multiple visits, active site mapping, timing around incubation and fledging.
    - Razorbill: plot-based monitoring, active site delineation, repeated checks.
  - Purpose of methods: to derive colony productivity as the number of fledged chicks divided by the number of active (or completed) nests.

- Reuse considerations and documentation lineage
  - Documented methodologies enable reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
  - Data governance and archival practices ensure long-term accessibility and traceability (CEH Edinburgh archive).
