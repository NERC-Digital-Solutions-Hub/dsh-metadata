# Contextual metadata for Isle of May Breeding Success 1982-2012 dataset

## Overview
- Dataset of calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species at representative Isle of May colonies (East coast of Scotland).
- Time span: 1982–2012; annual rows with six breeding success (BS) columns and six active-nest counts.
- Species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake, and northern fulmar.
- Access: free to use under a standard CEH data licence; authors encourage prior contact with CEH staff for publication usage.

## Data contents and structure
- Each year represented by a single row.
- Columns include:
  - Six breeding success rates (one per species; suffixed 'BS').
  - Six corresponding counts of active nests used to calculate BS.
- Data derived from the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS), part of JNCC national seabird monitoring programme.
- Data management and storage: datasets generated and quality-controlled at source; stored and backed up within CEH directories.

## Provenance and scope
- Contextual metadata for seabird monitoring from IMLOTS, with standardised methods implemented since 1987.
- Background: long-running field studies initiated by Mike Harris (1973); relationship to JNCC programme and CEH practices.
- Detailed species histories describing monitoring onset and plot adjustments aligned to population fluctuations.

## Data collection and field procedures
- Fieldwork conducted by trained staff following defined protocols.
- In-field data captured in notebooks/field sheets; later transcribed to spreadsheets; subjected to consistency checks against known hatching/fledging dates.
- All notebooks/fieldsheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Quality control at data sources via Access databases with error-checking queries to validate uncertain field information.

## Data quality, integrity, and governance
- Output and results subject to management vetting and tracking within CEH (Heads of Sections, Programme Directors, Finance Administration).
- Encouragement for CEH staff to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgement.
- Dataset integrity and alignment with contracted deliverables are central to data handling and reporting.

## Output, dissemination, and reuse
- Outputs presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals.
- Aimed at enabling environmental health assessments and policy performance scrutiny over time through standardized metrics.

## Appendix: species-specific productivity-monitoring methods
- Fulmar productivity-monitoring (nest-site mapping)
  - Plot-based sampling across colonies; multiple plots (3–5+ recommended); photographic plotting; multiple visits in late spring/early summer; express colony production as mean fledged young per occupied site.
- Shag productivity-monitoring
  - Regular 7–10 day visits; plot-based sampling with 3–5 plots; plot photos; record nest state and incubation/brooding status; colony production as fledged young per incubating nest.
- Kittiwake productivity-monitoring
  - 50–100 nest plots; photographic surveys; repeated visits; mark incubating/attended nests; track fledging via age categories; colony productivity as fledged chicks per completed nest.
- Guillemot productivity-monitoring
  - Several study plots (5 plots of at least 50 breeding pairs); incubating-period photography; multiple daily visits; track active sites and fledging status; productivity as fledged chicks per active site.
- Razorbill productivity-monitoring
  - Similar plot-based, photographic methodology; focus on active sites and fledging outcomes; productivity as fledged chicks per active site.
- Puffin productivity-monitoring
  - Burrow checks post-peak laying; four plots of 50+ burrows; probing burrows with sticks to detect incubation; re-checks through chick-rearing; success as chicks present over total burrows checked.
