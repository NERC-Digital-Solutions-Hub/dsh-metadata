# Contextual metadata for Isle of May Breeding Success 1982-2012 dataset

- Purpose of the dataset: Provides calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species from the Isle of May, with annual values and corresponding counts of active nests, enabling map-based visualization and spatial analyses when linked with site plots or colonies.

- Temporal and species coverage:
  - Years: 1982 to 2012 (with species-specific starting years; puffin, guillemot, razorbill from 1982; shag, kittiwake, and fulmar from 1987).
  - Species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, razorbill, European shag, black-legged kittiwake, northern fulmar.
  - Data structure: one row per year; six columns for breeding success (BS) rates and six columns for active nest counts.

- Data provenance and context:
  - Origin: Isle of May National Nature Reserve seabird monitoring (IMLOTS) as part of the JNCC seabird monitoring programme.
  - Monitoring framework: Methods standardized since 1987; long-term data collection and quality control embedded in CEH practices.
  - Field and management context: Fieldwork conducted by trained staff with defined protocols; data handling, transcription, and archiving at CEH Edinburgh; output vetted by CEH management.

- Data collection and processing:
  - Field data: Collected in notebooks and field data sheets; transcribed to spreadsheets; checks performed against field records; inconsistencies verified in the field.
  - Data handling: All data quality controlled at source; error-checking queries used in Access databases to double-check and correct uncertain information.
  - Archiving: Notebooks and field sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh; spreadsheets backed up to CEH directories.

- Data quality, standards, and governance:
  - Quality assurance: Databases and field protocols designed to ensure data integrity; routine vetting of results against contracted deliverables and reporting timelines.
  - Licensing and access: Data free to use but subject to CEH data licence; researchers are encouraged to contact CEH staff prior to publication.

- Outputs and usage:
  - Primary outputs: Breeding success rates by year for six species; counts of active nests used to calculate rates.
  - Potential GIS use: Suitable for time-series analyses and map-based visualization when linked to sampling plots or colony locations; however, the dataset itself centers on yearly, colony-wide metrics rather than explicit geospatial coordinates in the summary metadata.

- Appendix and methodologies (method references):
  - Provides detailed productivity-monitoring methods used for each species (fulmar, shag, kittiwake, guillemot, puffin), including plot selection, plot overviews on photographs, counting protocols, visit schedules, and interpretation rules for fledging and colony productivity.
  - These methodological extracts underpin how breeding success rates and nest counts were derived and may inform spatial sampling design considerations if integrating with GIS.
