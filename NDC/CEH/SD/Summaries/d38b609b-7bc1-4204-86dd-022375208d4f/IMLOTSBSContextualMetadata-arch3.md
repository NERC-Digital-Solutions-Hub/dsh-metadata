# Contextual metadata for Isle of May Breeding Success 1982-2012 dataset

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset of calculated breeding success rates ( chicks fledged per active nest) for six seabird species at Isle of May, off Scotland, covering 1982-2012.
  - Each year is a single row; six columns for breeding success rates (one per species) and six columns for the number of active nests used to calculate those rates.
  - Free to use under a standard CEH data licence; users are encouraged to contact CEH staff beforehand, especially for publications.

- Provenance and context
  - Originates from the Isle of May NNR seabird studies, part of the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) within the UK JNCC national seabird monitoring programme.
  - Breeding success calculation methods are consistent since monitoring standardised in 1987.
  - Methods and monitoring rationale tied to long-term population monitoring objectives.

- Species and sampling design
  - Puffin: monitoring since 1973; standardised on 4 plots from 1982; plots reflect population fluctuations.
  - Guillemot and Razorbill: monitoring began in 1982 with increasing plots over time; sampling adapted to population changes.
  - Shag, Kittiwake, Fulmar: monitoring commenced in 1987 with multiple plots; sample sizes expanded as needed to maintain representativeness.
  - Consistent use of fixed plots where possible; emphasis on random or dispersed plots to reduce sampling bias; same plots reused each year.

- Field measurements and data handling
  - Fieldwork conducted by trained staff to defined protocols; data collected in notebooks/field sheets and transcribed to spreadsheets; cross-checks performed for inconsistencies; archival storage of notebooks/fieldsheets at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Data quality controlled at source; Access databases feature error-checking queries to validate uncertain information.

- Output, governance and dissemination
  - Results and reports undergo management vetting and tracking within CEH (Heads of Sections, Programme Directors, Finance Administration).
  - Staff encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgment.
  - Underpinning datasets and outputs are shared with appropriate governance and data-sharing practices.

- Appendix: species-specific productivity-monitoring methods (overview)
  - Puffin: post-peak-laying checks of burrows; four plots of 50+ burrows; probing to detect incubating birds; multiple visits through chick period; fledging indicators recorded to compute colony productivity.
  - Shag: cliff/ledges sampling with 10-30 nests per plot; multiple study plots; regular visits to track nest state, contents, incubation/brooding, and young development.
  - Guillemot: randomly selected plots (≥50 breeding pairs per plot); frequent visits from incubation; record eggs, hatching, and chick presence; productivity as total fledged chicks per active/in attendance sites.
  - Razorbill: similar plot-based approach with active sites, incubation, and chick monitoring; multiple visits to track development and fledging.
  - Kittiwake: plots of 50-100 nests; photographic plots; visits in late May/June to mark incubating/attended nests; track chick development and fledging age to estimate productivity.
  - Fulmar: nest-site mapping across plots; photobook/overlay method; regular checks to estimate fledging success per plot; express colony productivity as chicks fledged per active site.

- Data interpretation and comparability
  - Methods designed to yield comparable productivity metrics across species and over time, aligned with UK seabird monitoring practices.
  - Clear definitions of productive units (active/incubating nests, well-built nests) and standardized age/classification of chicks to support robust trend analyses.
