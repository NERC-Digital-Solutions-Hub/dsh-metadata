# Clinal variation in the mimetic butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene in the Chocó-Darien ecoregion

- Study scope: Data collected for a study of clinal variation in Heliconius erato and H. melpomene across the Chocó-Darien ecoregion (Andes–Pacific in Ecuador and Colombia; Pacific coast of Darien, Panama).
- Sampling timeline and sites: Five trips across May 2014, May 2015 (Mashpi reserve, Pichincha, Ecuador), January 2015 (Cauca Valley and Chocó, Colombia), February 2015 (southwest Darien, Panama), and March 2016 (north Chocó, Colombia).

Sampling design and data types

- Target and methods: Butterfly specimens collected with hand nets, focusing on H. melpomene and H. erato; observed individuals prioritized; collecting effort varied by day; subspecies inferred from wing pattern; sex determined from genital morphology.
- Specimens and preservation: Wings removed on collection day; bodies preserved in NaCl-saturated 20% DMSO with 0.25 M EDTA; stored at the University of Sheffield.
- Genomic data: 
  - 265 H. erato individuals genotyped with single-digest RAD sequencing (PstI).
  - 36 H. melpomene individuals underwent whole-genome resequencing.
- Data deposition: Sequencing data deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under project PRJEB32848; individual sample accessions listed in butterflyCollectionData2014to2016.csv.

Geolocation, site metadata, and sampling details

- Geolocation: GPS coordinates recorded with a Garmin etrex 10; coordinates stored as decimal degrees (lat, long) and altitude (m) for most sites; altitude missing for some near sea level sites.
- Spatial scope per site: A single position recorded per sampling site with sampling within about two kilometers of this point.

Imaging and data products

- Imaging protocol: Digital wing photographs using a Nikon D7000 with standardized lighting (two external daylight lamps at 45 degrees); shutter speed 1/60 s, aperture f/10; included an X-Rite color checker.
- Images per specimen: Up to two images per specimen, showing dorsal and ventral wings.
- File naming conventions: Ventral images named <specimenid>_v_x and dorsal images named <specimenid>_d_x.

Data governance and accessibility considerations

- Data sharing and metadata: Data are publicly accessible via ENA with linked accession numbers; underlying data shared in the associated CSV (but note that some metadata gaps exist, e.g., altitude not recorded for some sites, and sampling was not fully standardized).
- Verification and quality: Species identities confirmed by at least two experts; in some cases, genetic information used for verification.
- Data formats and standardization: Data collected across multiple sites and years with varying sampling effort, which affects standardization and metadata completeness; data are organized with clear accession records to facilitate reuse.
