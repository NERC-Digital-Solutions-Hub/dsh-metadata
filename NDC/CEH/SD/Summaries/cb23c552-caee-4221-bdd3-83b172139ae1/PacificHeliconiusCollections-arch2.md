# Müllerian mimicry of a quantitative trait despite contrasting levels of genomic divergence and selection

## Overview
- Data collection for a study on clinal variation in Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene in the Chocó-Darien ecoregion (Andes to Pacific in Ecuador/Colombia) and the Pacific coast of Darien, Panama.
- Sampling conducted across five trips between 2014 and 2016 in Ecuador, Colombia, and Panama.
- Types of data include field collection records, GPS coordinates, specimen preservation, genetic sequence data, and wing imagery.

## Field sampling design and methods
- Locations with GPS coordinates recorded using a Garmin etrex 10; coordinates stored as decimal degrees and altitude (where recorded).
- Single sampling point per site; samples collected within ~2 km of this point.
- Target taxa: Heliconius individuals with focus on H. erato and H. melpomene; non-standardized collection effort across days.
- Species identities verified by at least two experts; subspecies determined by wing pattern phenotype; sex inferred from genital morphology.

## Specimen handling and storage
- On collection day, wings removed and stored in glassine envelopes.
- Bodies preserved in NaCl-saturated 20% DMSO with 0.25 M EDTA.
- All samples stored at the University of Sheffield.

## Genomic data and data delivery
- Single-digest, paired-end RAD sequencing (PstI) for 265 H. erato individuals.
- Whole-genome resequencing for 36 H. melpomene individuals.
- Data deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive under project PRJEB32848.
- Individual sample accessions provided in butterflyCollectionData2014to2016.csv.

## Imaging data and standardization
- Digital wing images captured with a Nikon D7000, macro lens, and standardized two-light setup to highlight iridescent coloration.
- Exposure: shutter 1/60 s, aperture f/10; standard ColorChecker passport included in every shot.
- Up to two images per specimen (dorsal and ventral).
- Ventral images named < specimenid >_ v _x and dorsal images named < specimenid >_ d _x.
  
## Data management, quality and accessibility
- Specimens and data undergo verification and quality assurance during processing.
- Datasets stored and intended for upload to appropriate data portals; specimens stored at the University of Sheffield.
- Outputs include standardized data formats and accompanying metadata to support reuse and cross-study comparisons.

## Relevance and context for environmental analysis
- Data describe spatially explicit, genetically informed variation in mimicry traits across environmental gradients.
- Supports cross-site and temporal analyses of environmental health indicators related to biodiversity, adaptation, and species interactions in complex ecoregions.
- Demonstrates integration of field observations, specimen preservation standards, genomic data, and standardized imaging to monitor environmental biology over time.
