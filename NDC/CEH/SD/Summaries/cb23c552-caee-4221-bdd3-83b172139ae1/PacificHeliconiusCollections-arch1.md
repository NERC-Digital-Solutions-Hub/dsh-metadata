# These data were collected as part of a study into clinal variation in the mimetic butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene in the Chocó-Darien ecoregion between the Andes and the Pacific in Ecuador and Colombia, and the Pacific coast of the Darien region of Panama 1 .

## Overview
- Data describe clinal variation in mimetic butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene from the Chocó-Darien ecoregion (between the Andes and the Pacific in Ecuador and Colombia) and the Pacific coast of the Darien region in Panama.
- The study integrates field collection, specimen preservation, genetic sequencing, and wing imaging to explore patterns of mimicry and genomic divergence.

## Sampling and location data
- Sampling occurred across five trips: May 2014 and May 2015 (Mashpi reserve and surrounding area, Pichincha, Ecuador); January 2015 (Cauca Valley and Chocó, Colombia); February 2015 (southwest Darien, Panama); March 2016 (northern Chocó, Colombia).
- GPS coordinates recorded for each sampling site using a Garmin etrex 10, converted to decimal degrees (lat/long) and altitude (m); some sites near sea level lacked altitude data.
- A single sampling position was recorded per site; samples collected within about two kilometres of this point.
- Collecting targeted all observed Heliconius individuals, with emphasis on H. melpomene and H. erato; collection effort varied by day and was not standardized.


## Species confirmation and sampling details
- Species identities confirmed by at least two experts; in some cases also verified genetically.
- Subspecies identities assigned based on wing pattern phenotype.
- Sex determined from genital morphology.


## Specimen handling and storage
- Wings removed and stored on the day of collection; bodies preserved in NaCl-saturated 20% DMSO with 0.25 M EDTA.
- All samples stored at the University of Sheffield.


## Genetic data generation
- Heliconius erato: single-digest, paired-end RAD sequencing using PstI for 265 individuals.
- Heliconius melpomene: whole-genome re-sequencing for 36 individuals.


## Data formats and availability
- Genetic data deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive under project PRJEB32848; individual sample accessions are listed in butterflyCollectionData2014to2016.csv.
- Digital wing images captured with a Nikon D7000, using standardized lighting and a color checker (X-Rite) in each shot; up to two images per specimen (ventral and dorsal sides).
- Ventral images named < specimenid >_ v _x; dorsal images named < specimenid >_ d _x.


## Imaging and photography methods
- Images taken with standardised lighting to maximise iridescent colours; shutter speed 1/60 s, aperture f/10.
- Two external natural daylight fluorescent lights positioned at 45 degrees to incident light.


## Data quality, limitations, and notes
- Sampling was not standardized in effort, which may affect comparability across sites and times.
- Some data (e.g., altitude) are missing for certain sites; sampling near sea level is common but not uniformly documented across all sites.
- Data integration across datasets required unifying diverse data types (RAD seq, whole-genome sequences, and wing images).
