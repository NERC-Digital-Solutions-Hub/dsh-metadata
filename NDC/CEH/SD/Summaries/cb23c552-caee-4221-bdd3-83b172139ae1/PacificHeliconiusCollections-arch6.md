# These data were collected as part of a study into clinal variation in the mimetic butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene in the Chocó-Darien ecoregion between the Andes and the Pacific in Ecuador and Colombia, and the Pacific coast of the Darien region of Panama

## Study scope and context
- Investigates clinal variation in two mimetic butterfly species: Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene.
- Geographic focus spans the Chocó-Darien ecoregion (between the Andes and the Pacific in Ecuador and Colombia) and the Pacific coast of the Darien region of Panama.

## Sampling and collection
- Butterfly specimens collected across five sampling trips:
  - May 2014 (Mashpi reserve and surrounding area, Pichincha, Ecuador)
  - May 2015 (Mashpi area, Ecuador)
  - January 2015 (Cauca Valley and Chocó, Colombia)
  - February 2015 (southwest Darien, Panama)
  - March 2016 (Chocó, Colombia)
- Sampling sites defined by a single recorded position per site; samples collected within ~2 km of that point.
- Methods: hand nets targeting all observed Heliconius individuals, with emphasis on H. melpomene and H. erato.
- Species identities confirmed by at least two experts; some identifications supported by genetic data.
- Subspecies identities based on wing pattern phenotype; sex determined by genital morphology.

## Data collected and formats
- Geospatial data:
  - GPS coordinates collected with a Garmin etrex 10.
  - Coordinates recorded as decimal degrees (lat, long) and altitude (alt) in meters for most sites; altitude missing for some sites near sea level.
- Biological specimens:
  - Wings removed on day of collection; bodies preserved in NaCl-saturated 20% DMSO with 0.25 M EDTA.
  - Specimens stored at the University of Sheffield.
- Genomic data:
  - Heliconius erato: single-digest, paired-end RAD sequence data (PstI) for 265 individuals.
  - Heliconius melpomene: whole-genome resequencing for 36 individuals.
  - Data deposited in European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under project PRJEB32848.
  - Individual sample accessions provided in butterflyCollectionData2014to2016.csv.
- Imaging data:
  - Digital wing images taken with a Nikon D7000, standardised lighting, two external daylight lights, and a colorchecker in each shot.
  - Up to two images per specimen: dorsal and ventral sides.
  - Image filenames reflect side and orientation: < specimenid >_ v _x (ventral) and < specimenid >_ d _x (dorsal).
  - Photographic settings: shutter 1/60 s, aperture f/10.

## Data quality, provenance, and access
- Sampling was not standardized across days; effort varied between days.
- Data quality measures:
  - Species identifications validated by multiple experts; some corroborated by genetic data.
  - Geographic coordinates and altitude captured where available; some sites lacked altitude data.
- Data access:
  - Genomic data available via ENA project PRJEB32848.
  - Sample-level metadata in butterflyCollectionData2014to2016.csv.
  - Wing images available with defined naming conventions; stored records and metadata maintained at the collection location.

## Potential analyses and data products
- Geographically correlated genomic patterns of clinal variation between species.
- Associations between wing phenotype (dorsal/ventral patterns) and genomic data.
- Integration of GPS/altitude with genetic variation to explore environmental associations.
- Visualization dashboards or reports enabling end-users to explore genotype, phenotype, and geography in a self-serve manner.
