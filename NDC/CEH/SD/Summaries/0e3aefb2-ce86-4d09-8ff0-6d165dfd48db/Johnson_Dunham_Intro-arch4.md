# Moor House National Nature Reserve

- Overview
  - A comprehensive geological and ecological survey of Moor House Reserve, emphasizing the exposed Carboniferous sequence and the region’s peat, soils, and vegetation.
  - The work integrates field surveys, laboratory studies, and mapping to understand geological history, present-day ecology, and landscape processes.

- Location, Access, and Context
  - Located in the north-east corner of Westmorland, near Garrigill and Alston, between the River Tees and River Crowdundle Beck.
  - The Reserve sits in a remote, upland Teesdale environment with limited road access; the Dun Fell road and Pennine bridle-way provide seasonal access for walkers.
  - The area is characterized by steep escarpments, glacial remnants (drumlins and moraines), extensive blanket peat, and a harsh, wet climate.

- Ecological and Environmental Context
  - Post-glacial to present vegetation includes blanket peat, basin peat, bogs, cotton grass, Sphagnum, and associated bog flora.
  - Moorland fauna and grazing practices are documented; research includes efforts to improve grazing and establish tree plantations in sheltered zones.
  - Post-glacial vegetational history is reconstructed from peat basins, indicating periods of birch forest, reed swamp, and blanket bog.

- Geological Significance and Sequence
  - The Reserve affords almost complete exposure of the Carboniferous succession of the northern Pennines, with the upper sequence visible on Great Dun Fell and other exposures along the western escarpment.
  - Formations described include:
    - Superficial Formations: Recent and Post-glacial (blanket-peat, basin-peat, alluvium, glacial and periglacial deposits, solifluction, boulder clays).
    - Solid Formations: Upper and Lower Carboniferous (Upper Limestone Group with coals and limestones, Middle Limestone Group with limestones/shales/sandstones/coal seams, Lower Limestone Group; Basement Series with varying sandstones/shales; Upper and Lower divisions; Great Unconformity), and Ordovician Skiddaw Slate Series (slates, tuffs, lavas).
  - Notable mineral occurrences include veins carrying lead, zinc, barytes, and fluorite; some deposits (e.g., Force Burn Vein) are well exposed and largely unmined.
  - The area provides a key, largely unaltered geological record amid active geologic and ecological research.

- Data, Documentation, and Methodology
  - The project involved extensive collaboration across institutions and experts, including the Geological Survey, Macaulay Institute for Soil Research, British Museum (Natural History), Copenhagen Zoological Museum, and universities.
  - Primary data products include six-inch scale geological maps of the Reserve and a descriptive memoir (Chapters 12–13) with plates; laboratory peat studies and mineralogical analyses informed by multiple laboratories.
  - Field and laboratory work were supported by multiple grants, notably from the Nature Conservancy and the Durham Research Fund; substantial technical and archival support was provided by Durham University and other partner organizations.

- Data Governance, Standards, and Accessibility (Data Leadership Perspective)
  - Data are distributed across multiple researchers, departments, and institutions, highlighting challenges in data standardization, metadata clarity, and discoverability.
  - The project emphasizes the importance of well-documented mappings (e.g., 6-inch geological maps) and the need for ongoing data updates and accessibility to researchers, policymakers, and collaborators.
  - The collaboration model demonstrates how cross-institution partnerships can support a cohesive data and knowledge system for a national nature reserve.

- Collaboration, Funding, and Acknowledgments
  - Acknowledges extensive assistance from scientists, curators, and institutions worldwide; key figures include G. A. L. Johnson and K. C. Dunham.
  - Gratitude extended to the Nature Conservancy, the University of Durham, the Geological Survey of Great Britain, and other organizations for technical support, access to records, and financial backing.
  - The work reflects a broad, collaborative effort to study geology, soils, botany, zoology, and ecology in a protected upland landscape.

- Key Takeaways for Data Leaders
  - The Moor House study demonstrates the value of integrated data gathering across disciplines to illuminate both historical geology and present ecological processes.
  - It underscores the need for robust data governance, standardized metadata, and accessible data products (maps, memoirs, lab results) to support long-term stewardship and wider community use.
  - The project highlights how rich, multi-source data (field observations, lab analyses, maps, and historical records) can be combined to produce a cohesive understanding of a complex landscape, guiding both conservation and research agendas.
