# The Moor House National Nature Reserve

- Overview
  - A comprehensive study (with acknowledgments and introductions) of the Moor House Reserve, detailing its geology, peat deposits, flora and fauna, and the surrounding landscape.
  - Aims to document the region’s stratigraphy, peat history, mineral veins, glacial features, climate, and ecological context to support understanding and conservation.

- Location, Access, and Context
  - Located in the north-east corner of Westmorland, near Garrigill and Alston, between Cumberland, Westmorland, and Durham.
  - The western boundary follows the Pennine Escarpment; the eastern boundary is defined by the River Tees; the Reserve includes Great Dun Fell, Little Dun Fell, Knock Fell, and associated ridges.
  - Access is limited and typified by rugged terrain; Moors and bridleways are used by walkers; field station and headquarters are at Moor House.

- Data Content and Geological/Ecological Focus
  - Geological Sequence
    - Superficial Formations: Recent and Post-glacial (Blanket-peat, Basin-peat, Alluvium, Alluvial fans); Glacial and Periglacial (Solifluxion deposits, Boulder clays).
    - Solid Formations: Carboniferous (Upper Limestone Group; Lower Carboniferous; Middle Limestone Group; Lower Limestone Group); Basement Series (Upper and Lower divisions) and Great Unconformity; Ordovician (Skiddaw Slate Series).
    - The area preserves the almost complete Carboniferous sequence for the northern Pennines, with continuous sequences exposed on Great Dun Fell and along the western escarpment.
    - Mineral veins (lead, zinc, fluorite, barytes) including the Force Burn Vein; several deposits are well exposed but some have not been mined.
  - Post-glacial and Peat History
    - Glacial deposits (boulder clays, moraines) and extensive peatlands; peat thickness reaching over 12 ft in some areas.
    - Peat stratigraphy records post-glacial vegetational history, including periods of birch forest, reed swamp, and blanket vegetation.
  - Climate and Ecology
    - Severe, wet climate with about 76.3 inches of annual rainfall; cool temperatures; waterlogged soils support peat formation.
    - Vegetation includes Calluna, Eriophorum, Sphagnum mosses; typical Pennine flora and fauna with grazing by sheep; efforts to improve grazing and plant sheltered trees.
  - Biological and Archaeological Context
    - Notable prehistoric and Roman remains observed; ecological and biological problems discussed by experts; access to zoological and natural history collections for comparative study.

- Data Collection, Collaboration, and Documentation
  - Long-standing, multi-institutional collaboration (Geological Survey, University of Durham, Macaulay Institute, British Museum, Zoological Museum Copenhagen, Tolson Memorial Museum, and others).
  - Field and laboratory work
    - Early and ongoing geological surveys (6-inch scale maps, descriptive chapters).
    - Laboratory peat studies (led by M. E. Smeeton) and mineralogical analyses; advisory input from noted specialists (e.g., J. Stubblefield, W. Ramsbottom, D. Sutcliffe, V. M. Professor).
  - Publication and Documentation
    - Structured into chapters (e.g., Chap. 9, 12–17) with plates and text-figures; permission sought to reproduce specific figures; references to prior work (Conway 1955; Conway et al. 1958).
  - Access and Collections
    - Permissions and access granted by curators and institutions; facilities provided by the University of Durham and other partners; access to geological records and museum collections.

- Data Governance, Access, and Rights
  - Rights and Permissions
    - Reproduction rights for text and figures; permissions granted by collaborating institutions and authors; access to records and collections facilitated by curators.
  - Stewardship and Provenance
    - Acknowledgement of all contributors, funders (Nature Conservancy, Durham Research Fund), and supporting bodies to establish data provenance and accountability.
  - Data Preservation and Access
    - Production of 6-inch geological maps; documentation across multiple chapters; use of university facilities and museum networks to preserve and provide access to data and artefacts.
  - Documentation and Metadata
    - Extensive cross-referencing among chapters, figures, and plates; clear attribution of datasets to specific researchers and institutions; notes on the sources of various datasets and prior publications.

- Challenges and Considerations for Data Stewards
  - Incomplete historical knowledge requiring synthesis of old and new data.
  - Access limitations due to terrain and restricted roads; some areas less explored or never mined.
  - Heterogeneous data sources (field notes, laboratory analyses, maps, plates) across multiple institutions.
  - Need for ongoing documentation of datasets, updating of maps and stratigraphic interpretations, and clear licensing for reuse.

- Practical Implications for Data Stewardship
  - Create a centralized catalog of datasets derived from the Moor House Reserve (geological maps, peat stratigraphy, mineralogical data, ecological observations, archaeological notes).
  - Attach robust metadata: location boundaries, geographic coordinates, map scale (6-inch maps), data collectors, dates, institutions, and licensing.
  - Track data lineage and provenance: who collected data, methods used, laboratory analyses, and subsequent reinterpretations.
  - Preserve and provide access to legacy materials (maps, plates, samples, museum references) through appropriate institutional repositories.
  - Formalize data-sharing and reuse permissions, ensuring future researchers can access and build upon the datasets with proper credits.
