# Moor House National Nature Reserve: Introduction

- The Moor House Reserve sits in the upland Teesdale and Westmorland Pennines, just south of Cross Fell, covering an uninhabited landscape with a field station at Moor House near Garrigill (Alston area). Access is limited by steep roads and footpaths; the Pennine bridleway crosses the area.
- Primary purpose: study upland peat moors, their ecology, and geology; the site uniquely exposes a near-complete Carboniferous stratigraphic sequence, including continuous upper Carboniferous beds best seen on the western escarpment and at Great Dun Fell.
- The Reserve provides a key natural laboratory for ecologists and geologists, offering well-preserved peat, glacial and post-glacial deposits, and several mineral veins (lead, zinc, barytes, fluorite) including the Force Burn Vein, some of which are rarely exposed elsewhere.
- Historical context: before 1951 the area was part of Appleby Castle Estates; the Nature Conservancy, local authorities, and several universities supported surveying, mapping, and ecological studies; funding supported geological mapping and lab work (notably 6-inch scale geological maps).
- Climate and environment: severe upland climate with annual rainfall around 76.3 inches, cool temperatures (roughly 55 F average in summer, 29.5 F in winter), and strong winds leading to waterlogged soils and peat formation.
- Vegetation and habitat: dominant peatland species include Calluna (heather), Eriophorum (cotton grass), and Sphagnum moss; the area supports typical Pennine moorland flora and fauna, with grazing and some tree planting for sheltered areas. Foxes are common and monitored.
- Human activity and management: grazing across the Reserve with fragile pasture; ongoing botanical and ecological enclosures; experiments to improve grazing and establish shelter belts; access restrictions to protect sites.
- Data and outputs: the project produced detailed field-based data and maps, with emphasis on self-contained data products (dashboards, pivotable data, charts) to enable user exploration; 6-inch geological maps are a notable deliverable, alongside descriptive chapters and plates.
- Acknowledgments: broad collaboration with scientists, museums, and institutes (Geological Survey, Macaulay Institute, Natural History Museum, universities, and national funders) who contributed data, analysis, and access to facilities; explicit thanks to individuals who advised on soils, peat studies, ecology, mineralogy, and field logistics.
- Key data themes described:
  - Geological Sequence: explicit separation into superficial (Recent/Post-glacial; blanket-peat, basin-peat, alluvium, glacial deposits; solifluction/boulder clays) and solid formations (Upper/Lower Carboniferous, Middle Limestone Group, Basement Series, Great Unconformity; Ordovician Skiddaw Slate Series).
  - Stratigraphic exposure: the Reserve contains almost complete Carboniferous succession, with continuous exposure on the western escarpment and at Great Dun Fell; provisions for mapping and interpretation (6-inch maps, regional figures).
  - Mineralogy and mining history: several mineral veins (lead, zinc, barytes, fluorite) exposed; some deposits never mined; veins provide ecologically and geologically valuable exposure.
  - Peat and post-glacial records: peat thickness up to around 12 feet in places; peat stratigraphy records shifts between birch forest, reed swamp, and blanket peat during Post-glacial times, with basins near Moor House offering full vegetation history.

- End state and purpose of the document: to present the ecology and geology of the Moor House Reserve, including the geologic map framework, environmental setting, peat dynamics, and the integrated data used to describe the Reserve’s significance for both ecological and geological research.
