# Geological map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963)

## Dataset overview
- Shapefile MH_Geology.shp containing polygons that represent rock types mapped in the 1950s/1960s.
- Originally published as: Geological Map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963) Westmorland; re-survey and publication by Johnson & Dunham (1963).
- Digitized in the 1990s by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (now the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology).

## Rock types and codes
- ALLUVIAL FAN: Sediment built up by streams
- FRESHWATER ALLUVIUM: Loose sediment reshaped by water
- LIMESTONE UPPER: Sandstones, grits, shales with coal seams and limestone bands
- LIMESTONE MIDDLE: Rhythmic sequence of limestones, shales, sandstones, coal seams
- LIMESTONE LOWER: Massive limestones overlain by thinner shale/stone bands
- LIMESTONE: Limestone
- BASEMENT GROUP: Conglomerates and sandstones with subordinate shale/limestone at top
- SKIDDAW SLATE SERIES: Slates, flags, tuffs and lavas
- SANDSTONE: Sandstone
- QUARTZ DOLERITE: Intrusive Great Whin Sill quartz-dolerite sills
- WATER: Water

(Note: Each rock type is accompanied by a short descriptive description as listed above.)

## Background and provenance
- Moor House became a National Nature Reserve in 1951; ecological work began to address knowledge gaps in geology and soils.
- A geological re-survey of Moor House started in 1954, led by G.A.L. Johnson under a Nature Conservancy grant; published in 1963.
- The reserve features:
  - Almost complete Carboniferous stratigraphic succession; unique continuous sequence in the region on Great Dun Fell
  - Western escarpment and dip-slopes with Carboniferous rocks; fossils and mineral veins (lead, zinc, fluorite, barytes)
  - The Great Whin Sill (quartz-dolerite) exposed within the reserve
  - Glacial deposits (boulder clay, morainic gravel) and peat deposits (up to 12 ft in peat-rich areas)
  - Post-glacial landscape changes tied to late Pleistocene history (~10,000 years ago)
- The map and its classification were originally published in 1963 and later digitized by CEH in the 1990s.

## GIS considerations and usage notes
- Data reflects mid-20th-century geological mapping; consider alignment with modern standards and potential resolution differences when integrating with newer datasets.
- Useful for map-based geological visualizations and historical geology studies of Moor House NNR.
- Ensure compatibility with existing GIS workflows in the British National Grid / OSGB36 system.
