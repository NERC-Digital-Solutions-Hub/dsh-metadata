## Data lineage and provenance
- Background: Moor House acquired as a National Nature Reserve in 1951; ecological work initiated
- Geological re-survey: started in 1954 (Johnson & Dunham, 1963)
- Survey conducted by G.A.L. Johnson under a grant from The Nature Conservancy
- Publication: The Geology of Moor House, a National Nature Reserve in north-east Westmorland (1963)
- Digitization: 1990s by Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (now CEH)

## Context and background
- Geological setting: Carboniferous rocks extensive within the Reserve; continuous sequence of upper Carboniferous beds best exposed on Great Dun Fell
- Key features: western escarpment exposures, Cross Fell Inlier foundations, Great Whin Sill (quartz-dolerite) within Carboniferous strata
- Mineralization: veins of lead, zinc, fluorite, barytes; Force Burn Vein exposed along the Reserve boundary
- Quaternary and recent deposits: glacial boulder clay, moraines, peat deposits up to >12 ft thick in some areas
