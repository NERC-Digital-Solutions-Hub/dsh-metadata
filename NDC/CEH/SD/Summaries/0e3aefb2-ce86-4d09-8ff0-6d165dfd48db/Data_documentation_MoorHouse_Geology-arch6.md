## Background and provenance

- Moor House National Nature Reserve acquired in 1951, prompting detailed ecological work.
- 1954: Geological re-survey initiated due to limited initial knowledge of geology and soils (Johnson & Dunham, 1963).
- Survey conducted by G.A.L. Johnson under a Nature Conservancy grant.
- Geological overview notes exposure of Carboniferous rock succession, the Great Whin Sill intrusion, mineral veins (lead, zinc, fluorite, barytes), glacial deposits, peat deposits, and evidence of past corrie glaciations.

## Geological context within Moor House

- Within the Reserve, near-complete Carboniferous stratigraphic sequence of the northern Pennines is exposed.
- The highest interest includes the upper Carboniferous beds, the Cross Fell Inlier, the Great Whin Sill (quartz-dolerite) exposure, and significant mineral veins.
- Glacial and peat deposits are well-developed in the region surrounding the Reserve.
