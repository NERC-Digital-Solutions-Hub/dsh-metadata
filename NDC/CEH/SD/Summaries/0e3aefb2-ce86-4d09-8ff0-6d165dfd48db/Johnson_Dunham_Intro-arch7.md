# INTRODUCTION

- Context and purpose: The Moor House National Nature Reserve is a high-altitude upland peat region in the Teesdale and Westmorland Pennines, designed for ecological, botanical, and geological studies, with an emphasis on mapping and understanding spatial patterns of peat, vegetation, and underlying geology.

- Location and boundaries:
  - Located in the north-east corner of Westmorland; near the border with Cumberland and Durham; bordered by the River Tees (east boundary) and Crowdundle Beck (north boundary).
  - Western boundary follows the Pennine Escarpment; the summit ridge includes Great Dun Fell, Little Dun Fell, and Knock Fell, connecting to Cross Fell.
  - The Tees headwaters rise on the Reserve; the area forms a watershed between the River Eden (west) and the River Tees (east).

- Access and facilities:
  - No continuous road across the Reserve; the Dun Fell Road (Knock Ore Gill Head to the summit ridge) is steep but passable to vehicles only up to Knock Ore Gill Head; beyond that, access is by foot.
  - The Moor House Field Station serves as the Reserve headquarters on the eastern side, near Garrigill.
  - The Pennine bridle-way crosses the Reserve north-south and is heavily used by walkers in summer.

- Climate and hydrology:
  - Severe upland climate with average annual rainfall about 76.3 inches.
  - Cooler, wet conditions with average temperatures around 55°F (summer) and 29.3°F (winter); frequent winds.
  - Wet soils lead to widespread waterlogging and peat formation; headwater streams feed the Tees and Eden.

- Geology and topography:
  - Exposed almost a complete Carboniferous stratigraphic succession, with the Carboniferous rocks outcropping on the western escarpment and dipping eastward.
  - The only continuous sequence of the upper Carboniferous beds in the area is exposed on Great Dun Fell; the region includes the western part of the Cross Fell Inlier.
  - The Great Whin Sill is visible within the Reserve, with mineral veins (lead, zinc, barytes, fluorite) exposed; several deposits have not been mined due to inaccessibility.
  - The Reserve sits at a junction of major geologic units and contains notable ore veins such as the Force Burn vein (barytes with galena) exposed near the southeastern boundary.

- Peatlands and palaeoecology:
  - Peat deposits predominate in the landscape, with blanket peat and basin peat present; peat can exceed 12 feet in thickness in some areas.
  - Post-glacial peat stratigraphy records periods of birch forest, reed-swamp, and blanket bog, with two peat-filled basins near the Moor House Field Station providing a full record of post-glacial vegetation.

- Ecology and land use:
  - The reserve is focused on upland peat moors; native flora and fauna are conserved, with grazing managed to support habitat integrity.
  - Botanical and ecological experiments are conducted to improve grazing and track vegetation responses; some shelter planting of trees occurs in sheltered areas.
  - The area has a history of mining and quarrying in the broader region (coal and limestone), but current work emphasizes conservation and research rather than extraction.

- Data and collaborations:
  - Research and mapping are supported by multiple institutions and individuals; significant technical and financial support from the University of Durham, Nature Conservancy, and other curatorial and research bodies.
  - The work aims to integrate geology, soils, botany, zoology, and palaeoecology to inform the management of the Reserve.

  - Visual materials referenced include Fig. 1 (location), Fig. 2 (geographic features), Fig. 4 (geologic sequence), and plates I and III; 6-inch geological maps are mentioned as products of the study.

## Geological Sequence

- Superficial formations
  - Recent and Post-glacial:
    - Blanket-peat
    - Basin-peat
    - Alluvium
    - Alluvial fans
  - Glacial and Periglacial:
    - Solifluxion deposits; sandy and stony
    - Boulder clays

- Solid formations (Carboniferous and older)
  - Carboniferous (Upper):
    - Upper Limestone Group; sandstones and shales with coal seams and limestone bands
  - Lower Carboniferous
  - Middle Limestone Group; rhythmic sequence of limestones, shales, sandstones, coal seams
  - Lower Limestone Group; massive limestones overlain by thin bands of shale, sandstone, and limestone
  - Basement Series:
    - Upper division; sandstones and shales with thin limestones
    - Lower division; massive conglomerates with interbedded sandstones
  - Great Unconformity
  - Ordovician:
    - Skiddaw Slate Series; slates, tuffs, lavas, flags

- Notable geological features within the Reserve
  - Continuous Carboniferous sequence exposures, especially on the western escarpment.
  - Great Whin Sill exposures and associated mineral veins (lead, zinc, barytes, fluorite).
  - Force Burn Vein (barytes with galena) as a prominent outcrop, one of the few well-exposed surface deposits in the northern Pennines.

- Data and visualization implications for GIS
  - The document provides explicit boundaries, stratigraphic units, and fault/vein exposures that can be mapped as layers.
  - Spatial relationships among escarpment features, drainage, peat basins, and mineral veins can inform multi-layer GIS representations (geology, hydrology, peat reserves, access routes).
  - References to figures and maps indicate source materials for geospatial data layers (boundaries, formations, and outcrops).

- Historical and research context
  - The geological survey of the Reserve (begun in 1954) involved collaboration with researchers across geology, botany, and ecology, with ongoing publications and reports detailing methods and findings.
  - The landscape’s geology is integral to understanding the ecological and palaeoecological records captured in peat sequences and basins.
