## Provenance and background

- Moor House was acquired as a National Nature Reserve in 1951.
- A geological re-survey began in 1954 due to limited initial knowledge of local geology and soils (Johnson & Dunham, 1963).
- The survey was led by G.A.L. Johnson, funded by The Nature Conservancy.
- Publication and reporting from 1963; digitization occurred in the 1990s.

## Geological context

- The Reserve exposes almost complete Carboniferous stratigraphy of the northern Pennines; the upper Carboniferous sequence is best exposed on Great Dun Fell.
- Carboniferous outcrop dips eastwards, forming benches and dip-slopes east of the summit ridge.
- Underlying Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the Cross Fell Inlier are present at the western escarpment foot.
- The Great Whin Sill (quartz-dolerite) intrudes the Carboniferous sequence and is visible on the western escarpment and in the Tees valley.
- Mineral veins (lead, zinc, fluorite, barytes) are exposed; some historic deposits were never mined due to inaccessibility (e.g., Force Burn Vein with barytes and galena).
- Glacial features (boulder clay, morainic gravels) and peat deposits are well-developed; peat can exceed 12 ft in thickness in some levels.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and analysis

- Provides a standardized, historical geological baseline for Moor House within Great Britain.
- Useful for integrating with other environmental datasets (e.g., soils, hydrology, vegetation, glacial history, mineralogy) to assess landscape evolution, groundwater flow, or habitat suitability.
- The dataset serves as a point of comparison for temporal studies, though limits due to its vintage (1950s/1960s mapping) should be acknowledged.
- Encourages combining with other data sources to increase value beyond a single-use map and to improve data accessibility for broader analysis.
