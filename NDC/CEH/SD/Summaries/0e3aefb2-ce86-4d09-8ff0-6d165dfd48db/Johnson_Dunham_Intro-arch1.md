# Moor House National Nature Reserve: Geological and Ecological Survey (Johnson & Dunham, 1962)

- Acknowledgments and purpose
  - Acknowledges numerous institutions and individuals for guidance, access, and technical support.
  - Funded by the Nature Conservancy and the Durham University, with additional technical assistance from the Geological Survey, Macaulay Institute, and various museums.
  - The study aims to document the geology, soils, peat, flora and fauna, and ecological processes of the upland Moor House Reserve to support scientific understanding and conservation.

- Location, access, and setting
  - Located in Teesdale and the northern Pennines, near Cross Fell; in the north-east corner of Westmorland, near the boundary with Cumberland and Durham.
  - The western boundary runs along the Pennine Escarpment; eastern boundary follows the River Tees and Trout Beck; the summit ridge forms part of the boundary.
  - Access is limited: no road across the Reserve; Moor House Field Station near Garrigill; the Dun Fell Road is steep and largely restricted to foot traffic beyond Knock Ore Gill Head; the Pennine bridleway crosses the Reserve north–south and is popular with walkers.

- Geology and stratigraphy
  - The Reserve exposes almost the complete Carboniferous sequence of the northern Pennines, including outcrops on the western escarpment and inliers within the Reserve.
  - Key formations referenced include:
    - Upper Carboniferous: Upper Limestone Group (rocks with coal seams and limestone bands), and associated sandstones/shales.
    - Lower Carboniferous: Lower Limestone Group; Middle Limestone Group (rhythmic limestone–shale–sandstone sequences with coal seams).
    - Basement Series (Upper and Lower divisions) with variegated sandstones, shales, and conglomerates.
    - Great Unconformity; Ordovician Skiddaw Slate Series (slates, tuffs, lavas, flags).
  - The region includes intrusions such as the Great Whin Sill, displaying transgressive relationships, and notable mineral veins (lead, zinc, barytes, fluorite) exposed within the Reserve (e.g., Force Burn Vein with barytes and galena).

- Glacial and surface processes
  - Glacial and periglacial deposits are well developed, including boulder clays and morainic gravels; evidence of corrie glaciation and associated landforms (drumlins, moraines).

- Peat, soils, and post-glacial vegetation
  - The moorland features thick blanket- and basin-peats, with post-glacial peat stratigraphy recording cycles of birch forest, reed swamp, and blanket bog.
  - Two peat basins near the Moor House Field Station provide a complete post-glacial vegetational record.
  - Soils are generally waterlogged due to the wet, cool climate, fostering extensive peat formation and unique upland plant communities.

- Climate, hydrology, and ecology
  - Harsh, wet climate: average annual rainfall around 76 inches; cool temperatures (roughly 55 F high, 29 F low) with frequent winds.
  - Vegetation dominated by moorland species (Calluna, Eriophorum, Sphagnum) and a suite of Pennine flora; waterlogged bogs and peatlands are widespread.
  - Rich upland fauna and flora are studied, with ongoing work on improving grazing and planting trees in sheltered zones; botanical enclosures and grazing experiments are established.

- Human history and land use
  - Prior to 1951, the area was part of the Appleby Castle Estates; historically small-scale mining for coal and limestone quarrying occurred in the region.
  - Current land use emphasizes scientific study, conservation of native flora and fauna, and experiments to improve grazing.

- Research program, methods, and outputs
  - Initiated a geological re-survey of the region in 1954, with laboratory peat studies conducted in Durham and other specialized work.
  - Field facilities provided by Durham University; 6-inch scale geological maps produced to document the Reserve (funded by a Durham Research Fund grant).
  - The work draws on collaborations with multiple institutions (Geological Survey of Great Britain, Macaulay Institute, museums) and individual experts (ecologists, mineralogists, palaeoenvironment specialists).
  - The publication comprises multiple chapters addressing geology, soils, peat studies, prehistoric remains, mineralogy, and ecological problems (Chapters 9–17), with contributions by K. C. Dunham and others.

- Notable features and significance
  - The Reserve offers one of the few well-exposed, relatively unmined mineral veins (e.g., Force Burn Vein) in the northern Pennines.
  - It contains a near-continuous Carboniferous sequence, making it a key site for studying Pennine geology and the Cross Fell Inlier.
  - The combination of deep peat records, glacial deposits, and vertebrate/invertebrate ecology provides a valuable baseline for long-term environmental and climatic studies.

- Structure of the memoir and scope
  - The work is part of a broader memoir series on Moor House, with dedicated chapters on specific topics (geology, peat, soils, mineralogy, palaeontology, ecology).
  - The report acknowledges extensive archival and field collaboration and aims to make data and findings accessible for future research and conservation planning.
