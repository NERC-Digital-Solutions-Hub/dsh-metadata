# Geological map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963)

## Overview
- MH_Geology.shp: a shapefile containing polygons that represent rock types mapped in the 1950s/1960s, originally published as part of The Geology of Moor House, a National Nature Reserve in north-east Westmorland (1963).
- Digitized in the 1990s by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (now the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology).
- Attributes:
  - GEOLOGY_ID: numeric, arbitrary unique code per polygon
  - GEOLOGY: text description of rock type
  - ERA: geological era
- Spatial reference: British National Grid (OSGB36), Projection: Transverse Mercator
- Extent: Great Britain
- Original map scale: 3 inches to a mile (3' to a mile)

## Rock types mapped
- Alluvial and sedimentary units: ALLUVIAL FAN, FRESHWATER ALLUVIUM
- Limestone sequence: LIMESTONE UPPER, LIMESTONE MIDDLE, LIMESTONE LOWER, LIMESTONE
- Sandstones and related: SANDSTONE, BASEMENT GROUP
- Slate and volcanic/igneous rocks: SKIDDAW SLATE SERIES, QUARTZ DOLERITE (Great Whin Sill)
- Other: WATER
- A coded list accompanies the dataset, detailing descriptions and classifications for each polygon.

## Background and geological context
- Moor House National Nature Reserve acquired in 1951; early ecological work to address knowledge gaps about geology and soils.
- A geological re-survey began in 1954, led by G.A.L. Johnson, funded by The Nature Conservancy.
- Geological overview: 
  - Exposes nearly complete Carboniferous stratigraphy of the northern Pennines.
  - The only continuous sequence of the upper Carboniferous beds in the region exposed at Great Dun Fell.
  - Western escarpment hosts Carboniferous outcrops; underlying Lower Palaeozoic rocks from the Cross Fell Inlier.
  - Great Whin Sill (quartz-dolerite) exposed within the reserve.
  - Mineral veins (lead, zinc, fluorite, barytes) present; Force Burn Vein exposed for ~500 ft.
  - Glacial deposits (boulder clay, morainic gravel) and peat deposits up to 12 ft thick in some areas.
