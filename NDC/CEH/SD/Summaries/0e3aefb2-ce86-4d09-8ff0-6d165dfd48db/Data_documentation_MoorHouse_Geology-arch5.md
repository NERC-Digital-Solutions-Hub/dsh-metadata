# Geological map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963)

- Overview
  - Shapefile dataset of polygons representing rock types mapped in the Moor House area in the 1950s/1960s, originally published in 1963 and digitized in the 1990s by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (now CEH). Prepared for the Moor House National Nature Reserve context.

- Data content and structure
  - Format: Shapefile containing polygons that denote rock-type areas.
  - Attributes:
    - GEOLOGY_ID: numeric, arbitrary unique code per polygon
    - GEOLOGY: text description of rock type
    - ERA: geological era
  - Rock types (examples from the mapping, with codes described): 
    - ALLUVIAL FAN
    - FRESHWATER ALLUVIUM
    - LIMESTONE UPPER
    - LIMESTONE MIDDLE
    - LIMESTONE LOWER
    - LIMESTONE
    - BASEMENT GROUP
    - SKIDDAW SLATE SERIES
    - SANDSTONE
    - QUARTZ DOLERITE
    - WATER
  - Spatial reference and extent:
    - Coordinate system: British National Grid (OSGB36), Transverse Mercator
    - Extent: Great Britain
    - Original map scale/resolution: 3 arc-minutes to a mile
  - Provenance of the data:
    - Original publication: Geological Map of Moor House, a National Nature Reserve in north-east Westmorland (1963), Johnson G.A.L. and Dunham K.C.
    - Digitization: In the 1990s by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (now CEH)
  - Publication and lineage:
    - Background geological overview and site context describe Carboniferous rocks, surface geology, and notable features (e.g., Great Whin Sill, Force Burn vein, glacial deposits, peat deposits)
    - Related literature: The 1963 monograph and other references in the environment change network

- Data quality, limitations, and stewardship notes
  - Derived from mid-20th-century mapping; potential historical inaccuracies or outdated classifications by modern standards.
  - Scale and resolution limitations inherent to the original mapping (3′ to 1 mile) may affect precision for current applications.
  - Digitization introduces an additional data lineage step; metadata should capture the digitization date and methods.
  - No explicit licensing or access restrictions stated; stewardship should document usage rights and citation requirements.

- Governance, access, and usage considerations for Data Stewards
  - Documentation to maintain: dataset title, creators (original authors and digitizers), digitization date, map source, spatial reference, scale, and known quality notes.
  - Update and interoperability: consider aligning with existing rock-type datasets; assess need for updates or re-surveys; document any updates or corrections.
  - Accessibility: ensure the dataset is uploaded to relevant data portals and catalogued with complete lineage, references, and suggested citations.
  - User guidance: provide metadata that clarifies the historical nature of the dataset, recommended use cases (geological interpretation, historical landscape studies), and any limitations for precise GIS analyses.
  - Licensing and citation: capture licensing terms or request for attribution; cite Moor House Geological Map (1963) and the digitization effort (1990s) in any use.
