# The germination rates of seeds from Eschscholzia californica plants located within habitats comprising habitats with different floral cover

## Overview
- Dataset on germination rates of Eschscholzia californica seeds collected from plants exposed to habitats with varying floral cover.
- Collected in June 2015 at the Hillesden estate, Buckinghamshire, UK.
- Part of a larger experiment examining how floral resources influence pollination services to isolated plants.
- 48 field-exposed plants, with 20 seeds sown per plant; germination counted over a 30-day period after maturation; seeds not germinating by 90 days recorded as non-viable.
- Data intended to support environmental monitoring through standardized, comparable outputs.

## Experimental design
- Experimental arrays consisting of three E. californica plants, spaced 1 m apart in a triangular arrangement.
- 16 arrays across four replicate blocks (each 100 hectares), >500 m between blocks.
- Within each block, four arrays placed along a 150 m transect centered at the boundary between florally rich wildflower habitat and florally poor habitat (two arrays in rich habitat, two in poor habitat).

## Collection methods
- All open flowers removed before field placement; plants exposed for 16 days to enable anthesis and potential multiple pollination events.
- Fruits tagged to ensure only period-relevant development is analyzed.
- Plants collected and stored under controlled glasshouse conditions (day/night 20°C/15°C; 12:12 light:dark) until fruit maturation.
- Upon maturation, 20 seeds from each of the 48 plants were sown in compost and monitored under the same glasshouse conditions.
- Germination recorded daily for 30 days; seeds not germinating by 90 days were recorded as non-viable.
- Germination success expressed as the ratio of germinated seeds to total seeds sown for each plant.

## Data structure and units
- One CSV file: Germination_rates_of_Eschscholzia_californica_seeds.csv
- Key columns:
  - Block: replicate block ID
  - Experimental_array: array ID within a block
  - Plant_identification_number: plant ID prior to field transfer
  - Habitat: florally rich vs florally poor location
  - Treatment: contextual treatment/placement within habitat
  - Number_of_seeds_germinated: count of germinated seeds
  - Total_number_of_seeds_sown:  total seeds sown per plant (20)
- Data is complete and interpreted by Evans, T.M.
- Supporting documentation references the same dataset concept: germination rates of Eschscholzia californica seeds in habitats with different floral cover

## Relation to environmental monitoring aims
- Provides standardized, auditable data suitable for integration with other environmental datasets.
- Clear metadata and structured data facilitate quality assurance, data cleaning, and reuse for assessing pollination services and habitat effects on germination.
- Encourages data sharing and access to underlying data across monitoring initiatives.
