# VEGETATION PLOTS FIELD HANDBOOK: UK-SCaPE 2020

- Purpose and scope
  - Field protocol for the summer 2020 UK-SCaPE vegetation survey.
  - Aims to quantify vegetation change by habitat type and location through structured plot sampling.
  - Two main plot types: 200 m² vegetation plots (X plots) and 4 m² soil plots nested within the X plots; plus areal and other plot types across squares as per protocol.

- Overall data framework
  - Data collected per plot: header information, location, plot maps/photos, and species presence with cover.
  - Nested recording for vegetation: five progressively larger nests within the 200 m² plot (Nest 0 through Nest 5) to capture presence and cumulative percent cover; Nest 0 starts with a small inner area and nests expand outward.
  - Soil plots (4 m²) use a similar nesting approach focusing on soil-associated vegetation.
  - Bryophytes and lichens are recorded with a defined list and limited detail; total bryophyte cover is prioritized.
  - Data entry designed for digital collection via ESRI Survey123 (Vegplots) and Collector apps, with paper maps/photos for relocation and backend QA.

- Plot location, relocation, and data integrity
  - Plot IDs: Square, Plot Type (X or XX), Plot Number, Plot ID automatically generated (or manually entered for new plots).
  - Relocation status: Found, Not Found, New Plot (Replacement for unfound), New Plot (New feature/Land cover), Not appropriate, Access Denied, Too Dangerous; relocation accuracy varies by habitat.
  - Location capture: Geopoint collected (offline GPS possible); online mode provides a map to assist accuracy; latitude/longitude editable; GPS averaging and multiple basemaps supported.
  - Relocation aids: GPS coordinates, plot sketch map, and associated photographs to aid re-finding; metal plates/stakes used as markers where present (may be buried or moved); if a plate cannot be found after reasonable search, proceed with the best available information and mark as Not Found if appropriate.
  - Notable constraints: in homogeneous habitats, relocation error may be tolerated (e.g., up to 10–20 m); in heterogeneous vegetation, smaller errors may misplace habitat type; surveyors decide on Found vs Not Found with notes on disturbance or land-use changes.
  - Habitat access and plotting rules: record only land with permission; if a plot cannot be placed within a square due to land use (urban development, water, etc.), it may be omitted.

- Plot design and layout
  - X plots (VEGETATION SQUARES): five predetermined random positions within each square; 200 m² vegetation plots with 5 nested areas; 4 m² soil plots nested within the X plot; orientation along cardinal axes; arable fields require positioning 12 m into the crop to avoid edge effects.
  - Plot layout fundamentals: 200 m² X plot laid out using diagonal strings to define the square; nest 0 at the inner corner with a 1 m² area; nest 1 forms the 2×2 m square; subsequent nests expand to full 14.14×14.14 m (outer boundary). The 2×2 m soil plot nests are the inner component of the X plot.
  - 4 m² X plot (soil nest) specifics: nest 0 is the innermost area; subsequent nests extend similarly for soil sampling, with the total plot cover summed across nests.
  - Special cases: in arable fields, plots are positioned to minimize cropping disturbance; if land is unavailable or unsafe, plots may be relocated within the same sector using the five-sector overlay.

- Plot types and recording requirements
  - Areal plots: standardized 200 m² X plots and 4 m² soils; other areal plots exist as per Appendix III (recording history varies by square).
  - X plots: five random X locations per square; nest-based recording captures species richness and cover across increasing area; GPS at the south corner for X plots.
  - Plot maps and sketches: required for accurate relocation; if a map is edited/redrawn, indicate with explicit edits, initials, and date; capture a photo of the revised map.

- Data capture in Practice
  - Plot header (Page 1): square, plot type, plot number, Plot ID, surveyors, location, slope, aspect, photos.
  - Plot relocation data (within Page 1): Found, Not Found, New Plot, etc.; notes on disturbance and land use; geopoint captured automatically from device GPS.
  - Plot-specific header information (Page 2): data relevant to plot type (e.g., soil sampling codes for X plots; soils manual guidance referenced).
  - Entering species (Page 3): nested recording for vegetation and soil plots; multiple species can be recorded per nest; auto-complete lists with an “Other” option for unidentified species (to be updated later); total cover estimates per species across nests.
  - Bryophytes and lichens (Special notes): restricted moss list; total bryophyte cover emphasized; Sphagnum categories defined (green fat, green thin, red fat, red thin) with guidance on identification complexity.
  - Data quality: the software prompts for missing fields before submission; checks exist for missing data, duplicates, and consistency across nests.

- Plot photos and sketch maps
  - Plot photos: 2–3 photos per plot, emphasizing features near a relatively stable reference (e.g., rock, fence, tree); photos must show plot number and type; indicate direction on the sketch map; label photos with Po (Plot orientation).
  - Plot sketch maps: precise, measured distances and compass bearings to nearby reference features; north arrow always included; maps can be redrawn or edited with pencil edits when necessary; if inadequate, use annotated maps or tablet drawing.

- Data submission and workflow
  - Online submission: use Send Now when online; can resend by copying to a new survey version if edits are needed.
  - Offline workflow: Save as Drafts or Outbox; re-open to continue later; Survey123 auto-saves progress to minimize data loss.
  - Data integrity: QA checks enforce required fields; clear guidance on copying to new surveys for edits.

- Habitat classification framework
  - Broad Habitats (BH) and Priority Habitats (PH): habitat allocation is based on plant composition and polygon/plot stand characteristics; used for Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) reporting.
  - BH categories cover broad vegetation types (e.g., Broadleaved mixed and yew woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & Horticulture, Improved/Neutral grassland, Bog, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Montane, Urban, Inland rock, Sand dunes, Supra-littoral/Coastal habitats, etc.).
  - PH categories include Limestone pavement, Inland rock outcrops and scree, Calaminarian grasslands, Cliff/shoreline habitats, Urban PH, Strandline and saltmarsh, Purple moor grass and rush pastures, Reedbeds, and Bog-related PHs.
  - Recording guidance: assign Broad Habitat at polygon level; place specific PH within broader BH where applicable; note that some landscapes (e.g., cleared/ felled conifer areas) require descriptive recording of actual vegetation rather than presumptive future state.
  - Examples and definitions: the handbook provides extensive descriptive vignettes for Broad Habitats (e.g., Lowland mixed deciduous woodland, Wet woodland, Orchards) and Priority Habitats, plus guidance on how to distinguish boundaries and changes (e.g., post-clearfell scenarios).

- Appendices and technical references
  - Appendix I: Collector & Survey123 generic reference guides (installation, map usage, survey workflows, My Surveys, Downloads, and data management).
  - Appendix II: Random numbers (for plotting and sampling design references).
  - Appendix III: Plot types recorded in previous surveys (historical plot classifications and naming conventions).
  - Appendix IV: Habitat descriptions (detailed classifications for broad and priority habitats, including notes on how to record various habitat types and transitions).

- Key considerations for analysts
  - The protocol yields a time-series, spatially explicit vegetation dataset with standardized plot relocation and nested sampling, enabling habitat-type comparisons and change detection.
  - Data quality hinges on consistent relocation, complete header metadata, rigorous plotting discipline, and careful handling of unknown or ambiguous species (with photos and “Other” entries as fallbacks).
  - Data harmonization with habitat classifications (BH and PH) allows integration with habitat-based reporting (e.g., BAP) and cross-square analyses.
  - The combination of mobile app data capture and careful manual sketch maps ensures both precise geolocation and robust re-foundation capabilities for long-term monitoring.
