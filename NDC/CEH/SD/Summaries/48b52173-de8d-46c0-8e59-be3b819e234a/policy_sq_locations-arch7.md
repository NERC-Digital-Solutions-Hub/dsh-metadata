# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Sets the rules for access to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares.
- Purpose: maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- 2019 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1, UK-SCaPE National Capability).
- 2007 CS partners include: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Location secrecy preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future survey permission.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When locations may be released (and precision levels)
- General access allows identifying whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) may be released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances under licence, after the requestor demonstrates that their data/IP confidentiality is equal or higher in protection than CS data.
- Spatial data from within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality risk to location data and require the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences granted for finite periods and for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the project.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data remained secure and have been destroyed.
- No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could reveal square locations; consult UKCEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; still prohibits attempts to identify exact square locations.
- Licences for spatial data and four-digit references include a clause preventing users from deriving precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases following policy principles.
- UKCEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; signed by authorized representatives.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH supports the decision under FOI/Environmental Regulations.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing support within moderate demand; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; UKCEH may provide scientific leads to help define requirements and/or support appropriate use.
- Support for collaboration or payment is negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for GIS specialists
- For map-based use, display can show approximately where squares lie (4-digit grid) within a larger area without revealing precise locations.
- If precise (6-digit) locations are required, plan for an exceptional access process and demonstrate robust confidentiality/IP controls.
- Always comply with licensing terms: secure storage, restricted access, finite license period, destruction at end, and no third-party disclosures that could compromise confidentiality.
- Consider performing analyses on pre-processed data or derived indicators rather than raw precise location data when possible.
- Engage with UKCEH early to clarify requirements, potential support, and to align on data-handling practices.
