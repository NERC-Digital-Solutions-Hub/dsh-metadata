# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Defines how survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares may be accessed.
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to location data; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.

## Scope and governance
- 2019 rolling program funded by NERC (UK-SCaPE National Capability).
- 2007 CS partners include NERC/CEH, Defra, Natural England, devolved administrations, environment agencies, and related bodies.
- Decisions on exceptional releases are made by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners.

## Why locations are confidential
- Maintains sampling representativeness and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land.
- Public interest rationale governs the confidentiality stance; FOI/Environmental Information Regulations processes apply for requests.

## When and how locations may be released
- Location data can be released in four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) under licence to indicate general area.
- Precise six-digit grid references are only considered in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; the requester must show that accompanying IP data is equally or more confidential.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features) could reveal square locations and thus are treated with the same exceptional-access terms as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release (licensing terms)
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must be destroyed or confirmed destroyed at license end.
- No sharing with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data must not be used to visit CS squares or to monitor landowners.
- If released, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP protection requirements than six-digit releases; both prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations.
- Licensing terms for spatial data and four-digit references include explicit clause to prevent attempting to derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, issues hardcopy licenses with appropriate confidentiality clauses; licenses must be signed by a senior authorised signer.
- If an exceptional release is denied, processes under the Act and Regulations support the decision.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult UKCEH before committing to use data under this policy; such consultation may involve scientific leads and may be negotiated as collaborative or paid support.
