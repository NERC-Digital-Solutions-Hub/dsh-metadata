# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The aim is to maximise public-interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of square locations. This policy covers only survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- The 2019 rolling program is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE; historical partners include CEH, Defra, NE, Welsh and Scottish governments, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

- Why locations are confidential:
  - Preserves representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for survey integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission from landowners.
  - Intended to support future surveys and credible environmental policy.

- Release circumstances and precision levels:
  - Location data can be used to determine whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references (identifying 10x10 km grid squares) may be released under licence.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require UKCEH to perform preprocessing to avoid release; very exceptional cases may allow external release under licence if IP/confidentiality criteria are met.
  - Spatial data within squares could enable inference of square locations and is subject to the same exceptional-terms approach as six-digit references.

- Licensing and usage conditions:
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
  - Licences are finite, for specific projects, and data must be destroyed at the end of the period.
  - No sharing with third parties that could compromise confidentiality; data cannot be used to plan visits or monitor individual landowners.
  - If requested, evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP may be required.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP-protection requirements; users must not try to derive precise square locations or claim to have done so.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - If a release is denied, FOI/Environmental Information Regulations procedures are followed.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - For internal CS-partner use, pre-processing support should be feasible within reasonable timeframes; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to data covered by the policy; collaboration or payment for support is negotiated case-by-case.
