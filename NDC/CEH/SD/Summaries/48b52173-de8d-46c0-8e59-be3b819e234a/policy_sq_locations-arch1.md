# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Stakeholders and governance
- 2019 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC): award NE/R016429/1 under UK-SCaPE National Capability.
- 2007 CS partners include CEH, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.
- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) makes exceptional release decisions and issues licences; annual reporting on access requests.

## Why confidentiality
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing access for surveying land.

## When and how location data can be released
- Location data can be released at a coarse level (predetermined areas like Country/County/ITE Land Class/Environmental Zone) using four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) under licence.
- Precise six-digit grid references are only considered in very exceptional circumstances; must show that related data/IP is equally or more confidential to CS data and cannot be processed by UKCEH alongside CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality and release constraints as location data.

## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate purpose.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end of the period.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could reveal square locations; data must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; four-digit data cannot be used to pinpoint precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and reporting
- UKCEH makes approval decisions and issues licences; responsible for governance under the Act and Regulations.
- UKCEH provides annual reports on data access applications and decision grounds.
- For practical practicality, UKCEH may support pre-processing analyses within CS partnerships; requests from external organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; collaboration or payment terms negotiable on a case-by-case basis.

## Practical considerations for analysts
- If precise location data is necessary, explore licensing options and potential pre-processing by UKCEH to avoid releasing exact locations.
- Consider starting with four-digit grid references under licence for broader spatial relevance, escalating only if exceptional criteria are met.
- Plan for finite licensing periods, strict handling, and eventual data destruction; ensure compliance with confidentiality requirements and JCOP-equivalent controls if applicable.
