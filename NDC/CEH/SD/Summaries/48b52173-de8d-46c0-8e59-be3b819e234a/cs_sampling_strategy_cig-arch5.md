# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Overview and Aim
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used as the sampling framework for national, regional, and country-specific habitat estimates.
- Emphasises the need for representative, stratified sampling to detect change over time and to support policy-relevant reporting (England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-specific outputs).

## The Beginning: Stratified Sampling for National Ecological Survey
- Early 1970s: national ecological survey concept emerged; stratified sampling used to ensure representative coverage.
- Stratification reduces bias that can arise from purely random sampling and ensures diverse land types are sampled.
- The approach laid the groundwork for the ITE Land Classification as a formal stratification system.

## The ITE Land Classification: Origins and Purpose
- Developed from the lake district methodology to classify land by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) rather than plant species alone.
- The initial version in the mid-1970s classified a subset of GB squares (center squares of a 15x15 km grid) to create 32 land classes; surrounding four squares per centre were also allocated, giving 6,040 squares classified.
- 1 km square sampling unit chosen to balance fieldwork feasibility with environmental differentiation.

## The Sampling Framework for the First Survey (CS1978)
- 32 Land Classes established; eight 1 km squares sampled per class (total 256 squares).
- National estimates of habitat areas were derived by combining mean habitat area per square within a class with the total area of that class.

## The 1984 Survey: Expanding Sample Within Classes
- Land classification framework reused; sample size increased by 50% (12 squares per class; total 384).
- Focus shifted toward land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping.
- National estimates updated using the 1978 Land Classification as the basis; results published subsequently.

## The 1990 Survey and All-Squares Classification
- Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) expanded to include data for all GB squares; satellite-derived Land Cover Map linked to the program.
- Total of 508 squares surveyed; added urban and sea corrections; repeat of 1978 vegetationQuadrats recorded.
- Land Classification revised to accommodate all GB squares, but with fewer details per square; some squares changed class, impacting comparability.

## Development of the Land Classification: Toward a Full GB Coverage
- After CS1990, efforts to classify every GB square were pursued using major climatic, geological, and physiographic surrogates.
- A new simulation produced 62% correspondence with the original 1228-square classification; most mismatches fell into neighboring classes, preserving average characteristics.
- Resulting changes distorted class distribution slightly, prompting adjustments in sampling distributions.

## Developments for CS2000: Separate Country Estimates and Representation
- CS1990’s cross-country approach was reconsidered to enable England & Wales and Scotland-specific estimates.
- Implemented class sub-division into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and class aggregation where needed to maintain representation, creating 40 strata.
- Added 19 new squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes, plus 11 extra squares to balance England and Wales sampling.
- Wales-specific refinements included sub-divisions of Land Class 17 for Wales; Isle of Man squares were replaced to keep focus on the country-unit framework.
- An upland habitat module added to CS2000 to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Summary of CS2000
- Large-scale reallocation and expansion to support country-based estimates.
- Tables and maps detailed per-country sampling distributions and class representations.
- Special attention given to ensuring adequate representation of new classes across England & Wales and Scotland.

## Developments for CS2007: Wales-Only Reporting and Welsh Classes
- Wales-specific reporting continued to be a policy driver post-devolution; Wales required robust country-only outputs.
- Introduced five new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
- Added 43 Welsh squares to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class; in England, two classes (5e, 15e) remained with 4 squares due to sampling constraints but considered adequate for reporting.
- England, Wales, and Scotland sampling maps updated to reflect revised Land Class frameworks for country-unit reporting.

## Data Governance and National Estimates
- Acknowledges the choice between using the latest Land Classification or the original (1990) classification for national estimates.
- For consistency with a given survey, the latest classification framework is preferred; however, using the original framework provides cross-survey comparability.
- Table-level details show how sample sizes per class evolved across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- The sampling framework is tightly coupled to the ITE Land Classification; changes to the classification system must preserve comparability over time.
- Country-unit reporting requires careful subdivision and aggregation of land classes to maintain representation and statistical reliability across England, Wales, Scotland, and IoM.
- Additional modules (uplands) and Wales-only adjustments demonstrate the need to adapt sampling design to policy and reporting requirements without compromising data integrity.
- Documentation and governance are essential to trace how classifications, sample allocations, and estimates are derived across surveys.

## Note on Documentation and References
- The document includes a comprehensive history, acknowledgements, and extensive references that underpin the methodological evolution of the Countryside Survey sampling strategy and land classification system.
