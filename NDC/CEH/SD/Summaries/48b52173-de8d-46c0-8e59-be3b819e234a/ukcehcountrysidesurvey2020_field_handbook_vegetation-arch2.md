# VEGETATION PLOTS FIELD HANDBOOK: UK-SCaPE 2020

- A field protocol for recording vegetation presence and abundance across two plot sizes, enabling precise, repeatable assessment of vegetation change over time.
- Uses standardized data collection tools (ESRI Collector and Survey123) to capture plot metadata, location, photos, sketch maps, and nested vegetation data.
- Emphasizes repeatability, data quality, and clear documentation to support habitat- and policy-level analyses.

## Aim and scope
- Provide a consistent dataset to quantify vegetation change by habitat type and landscape location over time.
- Ensure plots are locatable in future surveys through header data, photos, and sketch maps.
- Store and upload datasets to designated data portals; facilitate data reuse beyond single outputs.

## Data collection workflow
- Collect digital data via ESRI Collector (plot navigation, marker location) and Survey123 (data entry forms).
- Capture:
  - Plot header information (site, plot type, slope, aspect, location, surveyors, photos).
  - Plot-specific headers (relevant to plot type; e.g., soil sampling for X plots).
  - Vegetation data (nested plots with species presence/absence and cover).
- Include plot photos and a hand-drawn sketch map for relocation in future surveys.
- Ensure minimal disturbance to vegetation, with special care for fragile habitats.

## Plot types and layout
- X plots (200 m² vegetation plots) and X plots for soils (2×2 m nest within the X plot).
- Five predetermined random X plot positions per square (X1–X5) to ensure standardized sampling.
- Nested vegetation recording within each 200 m² plot (Nest 0 to Nest 5), with increasing quadrats from nest 0 (1 m²) to nest 5 (14.14 m × 14.14 m).
- Areal plots and other plot types (e.g., soil 4 m² nests) documented in the plot types appendix.
- In cases where plots cross boundaries or land-use changes, relocate or replace plots following specified relocation rules (e.g., move 12 m from edges in arable fields).

## Plot relocation, markers, and verification
- Plots are typically marked with a metal plate (20×20 cm) or wooden stake to aid relocation.
- Metal detectors provided to locate markers; some markers may have moved or become buried over time.
- If a plot cannot be relocated confidently within 5–10 minutes (or time allows), classify as not found and create a new plot as needed.
- Use GPS, sketch maps, and photos to verify relocation; document any disturbance or unsuitability (e.g., access denial, safety concerns).

## Plot header and relocation guidance
- If revisiting a plot, choices include Found, Not Found, New Plot, Not Appropriate, Access Denied, Too Dangerous.
- Location coordinates ( geopoint) are captured; offline GPS may be used, with map-based accuracy checks when online.
- When relocation uncertainty is high, document the reasoning in plot notes; for homogenous habitats, higher relocation error may be acceptable.

## Plot recording: pages and data capture
- Page 1: Plot header information (site name, recorders, slope, aspect, location, photos).
- Page 2: Plot-specific headers (varies by plot type; soil sampling details for X plots).
- Page 3: Vegetation plot data (or soil data for soil plots):
  - VEGETATION SQUARES: Nested 200 m² plot with five nests (Nest 0–Nest 4, plus total nest 5 for full area).
  - SOIL SQUARES: Nested 2×2 m quadrats for soil plots with presence/absence and cover.
- Plot maps and coordinates are tied to GPS and sketch maps to enable re-finding plots.

## Plot photo and sketch map protocols
- Take two to three photos per plot focusing on recognizable nearby features to aid relocation (e.g., rock, tree, fence post).
- Photos must clearly show plot number and type; label photos with plot identifiers.
- Draw a clear sketch map on waterproof paper or annotate via tablet for relocation; include GPS reference point and bearings.

## Nest structure and species recording (200 m² X plot)
- Nest 0: Record presence of species within innermost 1 m² quad; estimate total cover (including ground flora and other components) to approximately 100%.
- Nest 1–Nest 4: Expand search to successive nests (2×2 m, 4×4 m, 8×8 m, 14.14×14.14 m) recording new species found in each nest.
- Total cover per species is recorded for the full plot (Nest 5) after scanning all nests.
- Bryophytes recorded are limited to mosses listed in the protocol; total bryophyte cover is prioritized.
- Aggregations/Combinations: record certain difficult taxa as predefined combinations when species-level identification is not possible; avoid uprooting invasive species.

## Recording: bryophytes, lichens, and mosses
- Bryophytes and lichens are recorded according to the specified lists; mosses are prioritized, with the option to record limited bryophyte categories if necessary.
- For mosses, a predefined list is provided; aim to record the total bryophyte cover where possible.

## Entering species and data quality
- Use drop-down lists with auto-type suggestions for ease of entry; if a species is not listed, use Other and a free-text box.
- If a species cannot be identified immediately, use a paper bag or a photo for later identification; replace with the correct name when identified.
- Enter species as they are observed, with covers entered to the nearest 5% or marked as present if appropriate.
- The software allows blank or duplicate entries; QA checks are needed to ensure data integrity.

## Submitting and managing data
- When online, use Send Now to submit surveys; if offline, use Send Later (saved as Drafts or Outbox) and resend later.
- Auto-save ensures data are not lost if the device crashes.
- Drafts, Outbox, and Sent sections organize ongoing, unsent, and submitted surveys; copy to a new survey to enable edits after submission.

## Habitat classification and contextual descriptions
- Plot-level habitat data are aligned with Broad Habitats and Priority Habitats for BAP reporting.
- Appendix IV provides detailed habitat descriptions and priority habitat guidance, including:
  - Broad habitat categories (e.g., Broadleaved woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable and Horticulture, Grasslands, Wetlands, etc.).
  - Priority habitats (e.g., limestone pavement, inland rock outcrop, reedbeds, calcareous/acidsic grasslands, urban habitats, supra-littoral zones, etc.).
- The habitat key guides allocation to Broad and Priority Habitats for consistency across surveys.

## Appendices and practical notes for field staff
- Appendix I–Survey123/Collector guides cover installation, navigation, data collection workflow, and data management basics.
- Appendix II–Random numbers and Appendix III–Plot types from previous surveys provide context for longitudinal sampling.
- Appendix IV–Habitat descriptions and Priority Habitats support consistent habitat coding across squares and survey years.

- Key operational reminders for analysts:
  - Prioritize data quality, standardized formats, and repeatability.
  - Ensure plots are relocatable with robust header data, photos, and sketch maps.
  - Follow relocation rules diligently to maintain comparability across surveys.
  - Use the nested nest approach to capture vegetation changes across scales.
  - Document any disturbances, access issues, or land-use changes in plot notes.
