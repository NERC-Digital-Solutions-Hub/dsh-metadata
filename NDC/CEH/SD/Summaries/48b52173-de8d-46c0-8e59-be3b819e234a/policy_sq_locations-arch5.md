# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

- Context and partners: 2019 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE; prior CS partners listed (UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH).

- Why locations are confidential: Protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for survey integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.

- Circumstances for release and precision levels:
  - Location data can be accessed to determine if survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing a square.
  - Six-digit grid references are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, with legal demonstration that associated data/models require equal/higher confidentiality.
  - Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, linear features) carry similar confidentiality concerns and may be released only under exceptional terms.

- Licensing and usage terms:
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project need.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed and confirmed destroyed at licence end.
  - No release to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; cannot use data to derive precise square locations or imply such capability.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) makes decisions on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - If approval is denied, processes follow the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - Reasonable pre-processing support inside CS partnership should be possible within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; support may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
