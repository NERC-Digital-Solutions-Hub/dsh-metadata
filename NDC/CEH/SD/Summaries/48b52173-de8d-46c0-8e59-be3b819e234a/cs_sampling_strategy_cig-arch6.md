# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Purpose and scope
- Describes the sampling framework and data classification system underpinning Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasises a stratified, random sampling approach to ensure representative national, regional, and country-specific estimates of countryside habitats and land use.
- Shows how the ITE Land Classification evolved to support consistent sampling and reporting across time and across England, Scotland, and Wales (and Wales-specific needs).

## Core concepts and approach
- Stratified sampling to reduce bias and improve precision across diverse land types.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to classify land into discrete classes (land classes) for sampling.
- Sampling units: 1 km squares (with surrounding squares linked to each classified center square) used for field surveying and habitat estimation.
- Data products: outputs include habitat area estimates, land-class maps, and self-contained outputs (dashboards/reports) enabling end users to explore data and observe changes over time.
- Cross-year comparability is influenced by changes in land classification; national estimates rely on how classifications are applied across surveys.

## Historical development and key milestones

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) applied to environmental data for 1 km squares.
  - 32 land classes created; center squares classified, plus four surrounding squares.
  - 8 squares per class surveyed (256 total); national estimates computed from mean habitat area per square within each land class, multiplied by land-class area.

- 1984 – Second GB field survey
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (384 total).
  - Used 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - Results published subsequently.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey
  - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1984 quadrats and expanded data collection.
  - National estimates published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification and fourth field survey
  - Classification expanded to 40 land classes to support Scotland reporting and broader regional/local estimates.
  - Separate, national reporting for Scotland introduced; 1990 classification used for comparability in some contexts.
  - Results published in 2000 with updated methodology.

- 2000 – CS2000 adjustments and country-specific reporting
  - Evaluation highlighted representation issues due to classification changes; changes implemented to enable England & Wales and Scotland country estimates.
  - Class subdivisions created to produce country-unit versions; class aggregations used where necessary to maintain representation.
  - Additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland habitat module added for England & Wales.

- 2007 – CS2007 adjustments for Wales-only reporting
  - Wales required Wales-only outputs; Wales sampling increased to ensure robust estimates.
  - Introduction of country-unit versions of land classes (creating 5 new Wales/England-specific classes; totalling 45 strata).
  - Additional Welsh squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class); English classes adjusted accordingly (some classes with as few as 4 squares).
  - Upland habitat module maintained to improve upland estimates for England & Wales.
  - Revised England, Wales, and Scotland land-class maps and sampling framework produced.

## Country units, sampling and outputs

- England & Wales and Scotland treated as separate country units for reporting; Isle of Man sampling is not used for country estimates.
- Wales-specific adjustments increased granularity for Wales reporting; England adjustments ensured parity relative to Wales samples.
- Table and map outputs indicate per-country sample sizes, class counts, and sampling rates to support transparent estimation.

## Uplands module
- An additional module (CS2000) added 30 Squares in upland/marginal upland areas to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.
- Improves statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates within country-based reporting.

## Estimation approach and national estimates
- National estimates are derived by combining mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total land-class area.
- Note: Changing land classifications affects consistency of national estimates; a 2006 scoping note recommends using the latest classification for consistency within a survey, though older classifications provide cross-survey comparability.
- Table 4 (original vs. revised classifications) highlights differences in sample sizes per class across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.

## Outputs, outputs dissemination and references
- Outputs include main survey reports and land-class maps; 1993 CS1990 report; 2000 CS2000 reports; 2008 UK results from 2007.
- Outputs support policy, environment, and landscape change monitoring, with data used to track habitat status and changes over time.
- Further reading and acknowledgments document methodological development and statistical guidance.

## Key data considerations and challenges (from the methodology)
- Representation and comparability across time require careful handling of land-class changes and country-specific reporting needs.
- Ensuring adequate sample sizes per land class, especially after subdivisions for country units, to maintain precision.
- Balancing cross-country consistency with the needs of country-specific environmental policy and legislation (England, Scotland, Wales).
- Evolution of data classification systems necessitates attention to historical data compatibility and interpretation.
