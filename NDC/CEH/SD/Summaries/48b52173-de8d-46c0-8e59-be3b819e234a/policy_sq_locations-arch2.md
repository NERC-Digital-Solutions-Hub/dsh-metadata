# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximises public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of survey square locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
  - 2019 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE; CS partners include CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protects representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and ability to obtain permission to survey land.
  - Public-interest justification; requests handled by UKCEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- When locations may be released (and precision)
  - Location data may be used to determine if squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence for approximate location needs.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require UKCEH to perform pre-processing analysis to avoid release; in very exceptional cases, may be released under licence if the requester demonstrates legally that their data/IP confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares could indirectly reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit references, under strict controls.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the license period.
  - End-of-license: written confirmation that data remained secure and have been destroyed.
  - Do not release data or derived information to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; if in doubt, consult UKCEH.
  - Data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar but less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; users must not attempt to derive precise square locations or claim to have done so.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; licenses must be signed by authorized representatives.
  - If approval is denied, UKCEH follows FOI/Regulations procedures to support the decision.
  - Annual report provided to CS partners summarising licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - Reasonable pre-processing support by UKCEH may be provided within moderate demand; other organisations’ requests handled case-by-case.
  - CS partners and other potential data users are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to data use; collaboration or paid support arrangements may be negotiated case-by-case.
