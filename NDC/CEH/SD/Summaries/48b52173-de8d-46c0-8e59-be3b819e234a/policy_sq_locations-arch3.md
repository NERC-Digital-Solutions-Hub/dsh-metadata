# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: Maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- Funding and partners: The 2019 rolling program was funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1, UK-SCaPE National Capability). The 2007 CS partners include NERC (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, and Scottish Natural Heritage.

Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

Circumstances for release and level of precision
- Location data can be released to help identify if CS squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, or Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence when approximate location is sufficient.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only provided in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; UKCEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release, and external release requires legal demonstration that IP confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) could effectively reveal square locations and are treated with the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; spatial data releases share the same licensing constraints.

Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need for the project.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for unrelated organisational duties.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- Data or derived information must not be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult UKCEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence that project management standards meet or exceed JCOP.
- Four-digit licence terms are similar to six-digit but do not require the same IP confidentiality level; releases must include clauses preventing attempts to identify exact square locations.

Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, as CS data owner on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Decisions are supported by the UK Act and Regulations; UKCEH provides annual reports detailing applications and decision grounds.
- There should be a reasonable expectation that UKCEH can perform necessary pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe; support depends on moderate demand.
- Requests from external organisations are case-by-case.
- Researchers and potential licensees are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; collaboration with a UKCEH scientific lead may aid requirements and usage.
- Whether support is provided as collaboration or payment is negotiated case-by-case.
