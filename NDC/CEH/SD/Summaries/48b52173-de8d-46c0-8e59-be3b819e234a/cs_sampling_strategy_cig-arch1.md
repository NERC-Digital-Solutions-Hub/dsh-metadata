# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification used for stratifying the national sample since 1978.
  - Aims to provide representative, comparable data on countryside habitats and land use across Great Britain, with increasing emphasis on country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and upland habitats.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage of diverse land types.
  - Stratification using the ITE Land Classification to reflect ecological variability across land types.
  - Field sampling units are 1 km squares, chosen from the centre of a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares allocated to classes for classification stability.

- The ITE Land Classification: origin and purpose
  - Developed in the 1970s to classify land based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) rather than just vegetation.
  - Enabled a manageable, hierarchical stratification system for GB-wide ecological surveying.
  - Early version produced 32 classes; later work expanded to 40 and then to 45 classes to accommodate policy needs and country-specific reporting.

- Timeline of development and surveys
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - 32 Land Classes derived from 1 km squares; eight samples per class (256 total).
    - Sampling focused on vegetation and soils; national estimates calculated from class areas and mean habitat areas per class.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - 12 squares per class (384 total); eight squares from 1978 carried forward.
    - National estimates recalculated using the 1978 Land Classification framework.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification and third field survey)
    - Classification updated to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Resulted in the first linkage with the Land Cover Map of GB; new data per square available for regional estimates.
  - 2000 (Revised Land Classification and fourth field survey)
    - Land Classification extended to classify every square in GB; 40 classes.
    - Introduction of separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) and adjustments to sampling to ensure adequate representation across countries.
    - Additional sampling to improve estimates for upland habitats.
  - 2007 (Further developments and fifth field survey)
    - Welsh-only reporting integrated more fully; Wales is sub-divided into country-unit classes (five new Welsh-specific classes).
    - Total strata increased to 45; 43 Welsh additional squares added to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
    - England classes some reduction in per-class sample size was deemed acceptable for reporting purposes.
    - Wales and England adjustments maintained comparability while enabling country-specific analyses.
    - Wales, Scotland, and England sample counts for CS2007: England 288 squares, Wales 107 squares, Scotland 196 squares (Total GB sample = 591).

- Country-specific reporting and uplands module
  - Separate country estimates introduced to reflect England with Wales and Scotland reporting needs.
  - ITE Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) for Wales/England differentiation.
  - Upland habitat module added in CS2000: 30 upland squares to improve precision for upland habitats in England and Wales.

- How national estimates are produced
  - Method: for each Land Class, multiply the mean habitat area per square by the total area of that class across GB, then sum across classes.
  - Notes on consistency: changing the classification used for national estimates affects comparability over time; the 2006 scoping guidance recommends using the latest classification for internal consistency, while the original 1990 classification may be used for cross-survey consistency.

- Data structure and outputs
  - Maps and figures illustrate revisions to land-class classifications and the distribution of sampled squares (e.g., figures showing original 1978 classes, 1990 reclassification, 2000 country-unit maps, and the 2007 England/Wales/Scotland framework).
  - Tables summarize sampling distributions by survey and country, including total squares, strata, and sampling rates per class and per country.

- Notable methodological shifts and rationale
  - Move from a pure GB-wide 32-class system to more nuanced, country-specific classifications to support policy and habitat reporting at England, Scotland, and Wales levels.
  - Introduction of country-unit subdivisions and aggregation where needed to ensure adequate representation within each country.
  - Increased Welsh sampling to support Wales-only reporting; adjustments to English sampling to maintain overall precision.
  - Inclusion of upland habitat sampling to strengthen estimates for upland regions under country-based reporting.

- Acknowledged references and development history
  - The document situates Countryside Survey within decades of methodological work on the ITE Land Classification and related ecological surveying, including foundational papers and subsequent methodological refinements.
  - The evolution reflects ongoing alignment with policy needs, data accessibility, and the practicalities of large-scale ecological surveying.
