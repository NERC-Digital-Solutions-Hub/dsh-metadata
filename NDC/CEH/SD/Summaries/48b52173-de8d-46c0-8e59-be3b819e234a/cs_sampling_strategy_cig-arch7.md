# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the sampling framework and ITE Land Classification used to guide Countryside Survey field surveys in Great Britain up to 2007.
  - Emphasizes the link between classification, stratified sampling, and time-series habitat estimation.

- The ITE Land Classification: origins and evolution
  - Rooted in 1970s work to classify land using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) rather than only species data.
  - Early approach used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on 1 km squares to define land classes; center squares of a 15x15 km grid were classified, with surrounding squares assigned via the ISA key.
  - 32 original Land Classes established (1978 framework), enabling stratified sampling across GB.
  - Later developments expanded and refined the classification to support national, regional, and country-specific reporting:
    - 1984: framework expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total).
    - 1990: all GB squares classified; land-use/land-cover focus; linkage to first Land Cover Map of GB.
    - 1998: revision to 40 classes to allow Scotland-only reporting; national estimates began to reflect country-specific needs.
    - 2000: further revision with separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); introduction of 40+ strata through class subdivision and aggregation; additional squares allocated to improve representation.
    - 2007: further adjustments for Wales-only reporting; introduction of country-unit subdivisions (five new Welsh/England variants: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; Wales received enhanced sampling to ensure minimum representation.

- Sampling framework across surveys (by survey)
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - 8 squares per Land Class (256 total) drawn from classified centers; 6039 sq. kilometers represented.
    - Habitat area estimates derived from mean habitat per square times area of each Land Class.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
    - Expanded to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Repeated vegetation quadrats; land-use and habitat mapping included.
    - Results published in CS1990 main report (1993).
  - 1998–CS2000 (Development of new Land Classification and country-based estimates)
    - Land Classification updated to support separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to around 40.
    - England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man treated with country-specific reporting using country-unit classifications.
    - Sub-division and aggregation created 40 strata; additional squares added to improve representation; upland habitat elements identified for targeted sampling.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Welsh-focused adjustments)
    - Wales required more robust Wales-only reporting; Welsh squares increased to ensure Wales-specific estimates.
    - New Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - 43 extra Welsh squares added; minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class; several English classes retained with fewer squares due to precision considerations.
    - Introduction of Wales-focused framework with England and Scotland continuing to be estimated within their respective contexts.

- Upland habitats module
  - CS2000 added an uplands module (30 additional squares) to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
  - Funded by multiple agencies; targeted upland and marginal upland land classes.

- Outputs and methodological notes
  - National estimates are produced by combining per-square habitat measures with land-class areas (mean habitat per square × area of the class).
  - Land Classification maps and revisions underpin the sampling framework and time-series comparability.
  - Time-series consistency considerations: changing the basic Land Classification can affect GB-wide stock estimates; CS aims for consistency within surveys while acknowledging cross-survey comparability challenges.
  - Data presentation includes extensive maps and figures showing original and revised Land Class distributions and sample locations (references to figures 1–7 and maps in the report).

- Wales-specific reporting and country-unit framework
  - Wales required dedicated sampling to enable Wales-only reporting post-devolution.
  - Welsh-class sub-divisions introduced (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); sampling expanded to ensure representation with a minimum of six squares per Welsh class.
  - England and Scotland built on the country-unit approach with adjusted allocations to maintain balance across the new 40–45 strata framework.
  - Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced to preserve country-specific reporting integrity.

- Chronological timeline of key developments
  - 1978: First Land Classification; 8 squares per class; national habitat estimates.
  - 1984: 12 squares per class; expanded sampling; landscape change data published later.
  - 1990: All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; Land Cover Map linked to survey.
  - 1998–CS2000: Land Classification refined to support Scotland reporting; 40 classes; country-unit estimation framework introduced.
  - 2000: Separate country estimates formalized; additional squares allocated; upland module identified.
  - 2007: Wales-focused revisions; five new Welsh country-unit classes; 45 strata; Wales sampling enhanced; England and Scotland adjustments to maintain representation.

- Practical implications for GIS and map-based data products
  - Provides a consistent, stratified 1 km square framework for GB-wide habitat and land-use estimation, enabling map-based visualisations and time-series analyses.
  - Land Classification acts as a backbone for GIS analyses, allowing end-users to explore spatial patterns across years and between country units.
  - The evolution to country-unit classifications supports policy- and region-specific reporting and decision-making.
