# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) presents the field survey framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007, and is the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification that began in 1978.
- The methodology is designed to produce consistent, time-series data on environmental habitats to support monitoring and policy assessment over time.
- This document links current sampling practices to a 30-year lineage of stratified ecological survey, emphasizing transparent data how-to and the need for comparability across surveys.

## Core concepts and aims

- Stratified random sampling is used to ensure samples are representative and minimize bias.
- The ITE Land Classification provides the stratification framework, grouping land into classes with similar environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to structure sampling.
- Field surveys sample 1 km squares within Land Classes; national habitat estimates are derived by combining per-square means with land-class areas.
- A sequence of surveys has progressively expanded the framework, refined the classification, and adjusted sampling to support country-specific reporting and policy needs.

## History and development of the Land Classification

- Early work (1970s): Development of a stratified system using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to classify larger land areas based on environmental attributes; the Lake District work catalyzed scaling to GB-wide classification.
- 1978 CS framework: 1 km squares classified into 32 Land Classes; eight samples per class (total 256 squares) for national habitat estimates.
- 1984: Land use survey expanded sampling to 12 squares per class (total 384); focus shifted to land use and habitat mapping.
- 1990 CS: All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; integration with the first Land Cover Map of GB; national estimates began using revised all-squares classification.
- 1998/2000: Land Classification updated to improve regional and local estimations; introduced country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) with 40 Land Classes; adjustments to ensure better representation across countries; new sampling allocations and a 30-square upland module.
- 2007 CS: Further refinements to support Wales-only reporting; creation of country-unit sub-classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an overall increase to 45 strata; additional Welsh squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class) and adjustments to English sampling to preserve precision.

## Sampling framework progression by survey

- CS1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - ISA-based 32 Land Classes from 1 km squares (centre squares of 15 x 15 km grid; 6039 km squares classified alongside surrounding squares).
  - 8 squares per Land Class; 256 total; national habitat estimates derived from class proportions and area.
- CS1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - 12 km squares per Land Class (384 total); estimates derived from the 1978 framework.
- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
  - Expansion to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; habitat data replicated from 1984 with added features.
  - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
- CS2000 (Revised Land Classification; Fourth Field Survey)
  - Land Classification updated to enable Scotland reporting; 40 Land Classes.
  - Separate country estimates implemented; 40 strata formed via sub-division and aggregation; additional squares allocated to ensure representation.
  - Introduction of upland/marginal upland module (30 extra squares) for England and Wales to improve upland habitat estimates.
- CS2007 (Revised Land Classification; Fifth Field Survey)
  - Wales-only reporting emphasis led to sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit variants (creating 5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increased total strata to 45.
  - Additional Welsh squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class); England adjustments to maintain precision where Welsh squares were removed; Wales became the most intensively sampled country.

## Country-specific reporting and upland module

- Separate country estimates were introduced to deliver England with Wales and Scotland-specific results, reflecting policy and legislative needs.
- Wales received dedicated Wales-only sampling enhancements (new Welsh classes, extra squares).
- England and Wales upland habitat estimates were improved via an extra module added to CS2000 (30 upland squares), addressing under-sampling in upland areas when reporting by country.

## Wales adjustments and Welsh-only reporting (CS2007)

- Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit variants increased the number of strata to 45.
- 43 additional Welsh squares were added to ensure adequate representation of new Welsh classes, yielding at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
- England did not receive a corresponding increase in squares to compensate for Welsh additions; some English classes (5e, 15e) remained with as few as 4 squares per class, but precision was deemed acceptable for reporting purposes.
- Wales-specific class map and sampling framework were updated to reflect the new country-specific scheme.

## Outputs and consistency considerations

- The national estimate approach: mean habitat per square in each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that Land Class across GB (and country units when applicable).
- National consistency: shifting to newer Land Classifications affects cross-survey comparability; a balance is sought between using the latest framework for internal consistency and maintaining comparability with previous surveys.
- Table and figure references in the document illustrate changes in the number of squares, strata, and sampling rates across CS1978–CS2007, as well as the updated Land Class maps for country-specific reporting.

## Practical implications for environmental monitoring

- The strategy provides a rigorous, standardized method for tracking habitat area and change over time across GB and its constituent countries.
- It supports policy-relevant reporting (e.g., country-specific environmental reporting) while maintaining a robust, repeatable sampling framework.
- The evolution reflects a continuous effort to improve statistical precision (especially in Wales and upland habitats) and to widen data access and integration with other environmental datasets.

## Data access and value enhancement

- A central challenge is increasing the value of the datasets by integrating them with other relevant datasets and enabling access to the underlying data that inform outputs.
- The standardized, well-documented sampling framework facilitates data reuse, cross-study comparisons, and broader analytical applications.
