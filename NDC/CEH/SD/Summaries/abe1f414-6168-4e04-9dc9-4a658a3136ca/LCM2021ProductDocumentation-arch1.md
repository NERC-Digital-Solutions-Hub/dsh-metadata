# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2021

- Purpose and scope
  - User guide for UKCEH Land Cover Map 2021 (LCM2021)
  - LCM2021 comprises six geospatial datasets across Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI): three datasets per region
    - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets
    - Land Parcel Spatial Framework datasets
    - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Outputs enable monitoring state and change of UK countryside; annual production supports change detection and temporal consistency

- Data products and structure
  - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets
    - Derived from classification of Classification Scenes; first band = most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class; second band = confidence
    - Not generalised by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine detail (e.g., small patches below MMU)
  - Land Parcel datasets
    - Generated by intersecting 10 m pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
    - Land parcels have minimum area ~0.5 ha (MMU); parcels typically dominated by a single land cover
    - Parcel-level attributes include _hist, _mode, _purity, _conf, _stdev, _agg, _n, gid
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
    - 25 m rasters created from parcel data; three bands per parcel: dominant land cover (mode), mean confidence (_conf), and parcel purity (_purity)
  - 1 km outputs (summary products)
    - Dominant cover at 1 km for both classes and aggregates; Percentage cover at 1 km (21 class bands for classes; 10 for aggregates)
    - Note: percentage sums may not equal 100 exactly due to rounding; coastal pixels may sum to less than 100
  - Coordinate systems
    - GB: British National Grid (EPSG 27700)
    - NI: Irish Grid (TM75, EPSG 29903)
  - Extents and resolution
    - GB 10 m: 0–700000 East, 0–1300000 North
    - NI: NI extent truncated to appropriate Irish grid bounds
    - 10 m classified pixels; 25 m rasterised parcels; 1 km summaries

- Data production and methodology
  - Seasonal Composite Images
    - Sentinel-2 reflectance images resampled to 10 m; four seasonal periods (Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec)
    - Bands 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8A,11,12 used to form Seasonal Composite Images
    - Occasional data gaps; classifier tolerant of missing data
  - Context rasters
    - 10 m Context Rasters to reduce spectral confusion (GB and NI have different sets)
    - GB: height, aspect, slope; distance to buildings, roads, sea, freshwater; foreshore and tidal water masks; woodland mask
    - NI: height, aspect, slope; urban mask; distance to coast, freshwater, road; foreshore and tidal masks
  - Classification Scenes
    - GB: 32 Classification Scenes arranged on a modified OS 100 km grid; NI: single 49-band Scene for the entire NI land mass
    - Each Scene trained and classified independently
  - Bootstrap Training
    - Automatic training using historic UKCEH maps (LCM2018–LCM2020)
    - Training samples selected from parcels with >80% purity and consistent classification across three years
    - Creates large, wall-to-wall training sets without fresh field data
  - Random Forest classification
    - Balanced sampling: from each parcel, 10,000 samples per bag, with replacement
    - Ensures adequate representation of rarer classes
    - Software integrates Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL (open source)
  - Validation and accuracy
    - 35,182 validation points across all 21 classes
    - Overall accuracy: 82.6% with 95% CI 82.19%–82.99%
  - Data accessibility and discoverability
    - Datasets designed to be discoverable; metadata and portal uploads encouraged

- Class relationships and terminology
  - UKCEH Land Cover Classes are aligned with, but not identical to, Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats
  - Tables and appendices describe mappings between UKCEH classes, BAP Broad Habitats, and aggregated classes
  - Appendices elaborate on class definitions, training data considerations, and known spectral confusions

- Validation details and interpretation
  - Appendix 4 provides confusion matrices and accuracy diagnostics (user and producer accuracies per class)
  - Notable confusions include grassland types (e.g., Improved vs Neutral vs Calcareous vs Acid), Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Bog, Heather vs Heather Grassland
  - Validation against 25 m parcel data is the formal basis for parcel-level assessments; 10 m pixel validations are supplementary and reflect fine-scale detail
  - Annual maps are expected to distinguish real change from random classification noise over time

- Practical considerations and guidance for analysts
  - Purpose-built for analysts combining topic expertise with statistical analysis and modelling
  - Best used by specialists due to scale, complexity, and the need to interpret context rasters and seasonal signals
  - Bootstrap Training enables rapid updates but relies on historical maps for training data
  - Data should be tracked with provenance; dataset IDs and metadata enable reproducibility
  - Changes to parcel identifiers from LCM2015 mean direct cross-map parcel ID comparisons may be non-trivial

- Relationship to broader framework and future work
  - Annual production aims to maximise temporal consistency and comparability
  - Continuous methodological improvements anticipated; potential re-application across the full catalogue if accuracy gains justify it
  - Time-series capacity supports change detection by identifying persistent vs transient errors
