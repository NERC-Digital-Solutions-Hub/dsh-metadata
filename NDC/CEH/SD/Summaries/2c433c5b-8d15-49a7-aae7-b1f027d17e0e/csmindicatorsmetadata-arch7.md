# The Common Standards Monitoring guidance documents for UK habitats

- Overview
  - This dataset provides lists of species that occur in the Common Standards Monitoring (CSM) guidance documents and links them to both CSM habitats and National Vegetation Classification (NVC) communities.
- Data sources and purpose
  - Species data (vascular plants and charophytes) are extracted from JNCC guidance documents.
  - The data are intended to support mapping and GIS-based visualization of habitat indicators across UK landscapes.
- Data collection and quality control
  - Initial extraction by Dr Kevin Walker from JNCC documentation.
  - Some genera or descriptive terms (e.g., Carex spp.; Carex with leaves > 5 mm) were replaced by species-level names based on author knowledge and NVC occurrences.
  - Habitat experts validated the selections during National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) development (Pescott et al. 2019).
  - Dr Oli Pescott performed manual checks, matched taxa to NPMS indicator species, and verified names against the BSBI database (with automated look-ups and manual verification). Results are included in the deposit.

- How to use in GIS and map-based products
  - Join indicator species to CSM habitats and corresponding NVC communities to create habitat-specific maps and visualizations.
  - Use NPMS_indicator status to filter or flag species of interest in maps.
  - Leverage nameLookup to align taxon names with BSBI-registered nomenclature for consistent labeling across layers.
- Considerations, caveats, and quality notes
  - Some updates to genus-level names and descriptive terms were made during data preparation, requiring awareness of potential nomenclature differences.
  - Data were curated with expert validation and cross-checked against BSBI and NPMS references to improve reliability for GIS applications.
