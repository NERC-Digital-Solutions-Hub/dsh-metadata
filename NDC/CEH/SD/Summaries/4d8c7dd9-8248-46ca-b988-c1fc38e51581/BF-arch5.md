# BF Protocol

## Aim
- Record the phenology of spawning of the common frog (Rana temporaria) at selected ponds/ditches.
- Use spawn counts and related pond measurements as indicators of frog population health and breeding success.
- Identify significant population changes and characterize pond conditions that influence breeding.

## Rationale
- The common frog is a widespread amphibian; breeding success is influenced by land and water conditions.
- Historical declines have been linked to drainage, habitat modification, pollution, and acidification.
- Spawning observations (egg masses) serve as a practical proxy for colony size and population trends.
- Water chemistry and pond characteristics (pH, temperature, depth, conductivity, etc.) relate to breeding outcomes and larval survival.

## Method (Overview)
- Site selection: one or more shallow ponds or ditches with recent breeding activity, accessible for regular visits.
- Timing: weekly pond checks starting around January (local variation possible); daily checks during spawning when feasible; at least weekly otherwise until eggs hatch.
- Spawn counting: record the date of first spawn; daily or weekly counts of new spawn masses; mark each new mass with a colored thread to avoid double-counting.
- Pond-wide measures: estimate total surface area of water occupied by spawn masses; record percentage of dead or diseased eggs.
- Embryo development: note the date eggs are first observed hatched; continue monitoring until metamorphs leave or for up to 16 weeks after spawning.

## Biological measurements (Spawn data)
- Spawn timing: date when male frogs first congregate and begin calling; date of first spawning; date of first hatched embryos; date newly metamorphosed frogs leave the pond.
- Spawn mass data: number of new spawn masses since last visit; total surface area of pond covered by spawn; depth at spawning area center.
- Mortality indicators: percentage dead or diseased eggs.
- Recording frequency: daily during spawning for spawn development; weekly for pond environmental observations; daily/weekly as per feasibility.

## Physico-chemical measurements
- Baseline water sampling: at first spawning, collect a 250 ml pond water sample for chemical determinands; conductivity and pH on unfiltered water; after filtration, measure dissolved ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P), alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.
- Mortality investigation: if unexplained mortality occurs, collect an additional sample for the same chemical analyses.
- In situ measurements: measure pH weekly at three random positions near the edge of the spawning area (50 mm depth) using a field pH meter; record water temperature weekly with a maximum/minimum thermometer at 50 mm depth, anchored on a float.
- Depth and temperature: measure depth at the center of the spawning area weekly; ensure thermometer placement and readings are consistent.
- Equipment and setup: field pH meter, maximum/minimum thermometer, depth measurement pole, and a suitable floating setup for the thermometer.

## Data coding and recording conventions
- Data are recorded and submitted following ECNCCU data transfer guidelines; core dataset formats are defined in the ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation (restricted extranet).
- Core fields (four key identifiers for each sample/record): 
  - Site Identification Code (unique ECN site code)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., frog spawn)
  - Location Code (sampling point within the site)
  - Sampling Date/Time (with time element if sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Core measurement: vertebrates – frog spawn (BF Protocol).
- Recorded variables (examples): pond ID, dates (first spawning, first hatching, first metamorphs leaving), number of new spawn masses, total spawn-covered water area, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, NO3--N, PO4 3--P, Cl-, DOC, depth, and pond temperatures (minimum/maximum).
- Recording precision: specified for each variable (e.g., 0.1 for some measurements, 3 significant figures for ions, etc.).
- Recording forms: standardized field recording form available from the CCU (Appendix II).

## Data management and governance
- Data submission: to ECNCCU; formats and field definitions are documented in the Data Transfer documentation; access via restricted ECN extranet (e.g., ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk).
- Metadata and provenance: core identifiers, sampling schedule, and measurement codes ensure traceability and interoperability across sites and time.
- Documentation of work: standard forms and appendices support consistent data capture and subsequent re-use.

## Practical considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure standardized core measurements and consistent coding to enable cross-site comparisons.
- Maintain up-to-date metadata (site IDs, location codes, sampling times, core measurement codes).
- Manage data quality through daily/weekly check schedules, clear procedures for spawn mass tagging, and recording of diseased eggs.
- Facilitate data sharing by adhering to ECNCCU formats and providing access to Data Transfer documentation and recording forms.
- Plan for potential challenges: incomplete user needs, timely data delivery, cross-system interoperability, large datasets, and updating legacy databases.
