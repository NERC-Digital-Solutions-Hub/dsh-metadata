# BF Protocol

## Aim
- To record the phenology of spawning of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in selected ponds and ditches.
- To assess the number of egg masses as an indicator of frog population health.
- To identify significant population changes and measure pond characteristics that may affect breeding success.

## Rationale
- The common frog is used as an example of a widespread predatory amphibian whose breeding is linked to both aquatic and terrestrial conditions.
- Historical declines have been linked to agricultural drainage, habitat modification, and pollution; acidification and aluminium effects on larvae are of concern.
- Monitoring spawn is more feasible than counting adults, and spawn characteristics reflect broader environmental conditions.

## Method

### Equipment
- Field-capable pH meter and a max/min thermometer.
- Resources to measure water depth (e.g., a depth pole) and to deploy simple measurement setups.

### Location
- One or more shallow ponds or wet ditches with recent frog breeding, chosen for practical access to frequent visits.

### Biological (temporal monitoring)
- Begin monitoring when frog breeding is expected; typically check weekly from around 1 January (adjust for local variation) to detect spawning, then daily until eggs hatch if possible; otherwise as frequent as feasible with a minimum weekly cadence.
- Record the date spawning is first seen; during subsequent visits, count new spawn masses and mark each new mass with a colored thread to avoid double counting.
- Estimate the total surface area of water occupied by spawn masses; assess the percentage of dead or diseased eggs.
- If daily counting is not possible and spawn masses exceed 100, estimate only the total surface area rather than counting new masses.
- Record the date when embryos are first observed hatched; after hatching begins, continue weekly monitoring until metamorphosed frogs are seen leaving the pond or for up to 16 weeks after spawning (whichever is shorter).

### Physico-chemical
- At first spawning, collect a 250 mL water sample from the spawning area for baseline chemical characterization.
- Measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water; filter and analyze for dissolved ions: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl−, NO3−-N, SO42−-S, PO43−-P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.
- If unexplained high mortality occurs, take an additional water sample for the same analyses.
- Measure pH, temperature, and water depth weekly: pH at three random positions near the pond edge at 50 mm depth; use a field pH meter; deploy a float-based maximum/minimum thermometer at 50 mm depth to record water temperature; record water temperature at first spawning and recheck weekly.

## Specimen recording and data conventions

### Recording conventions and data specification
- Data are captured to a standardized schema with four core identifiers to locate and time each measurement:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., BF)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time (including time where sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Core measurement: vertebrates — frog spawn (BF Protocol)
- Data fields include: pond ID, dates for first spawning, first hatching, and first metamorphosed frogs leaving; pond water sample details; site and core identifiers; environmental measurements (pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions, NO3−-N, PO4−-P, etc.); pond depth at spawn center; minimum and maximum temperature; pH readings at multiple positions; spawn counts, surface area covered by spawn, and percentage dead or diseased eggs; and precision specifications for each field.
- The protocol references a Data Transfer documentation for dataset formats and notes that data are submitted to ECNCCU via a restricted access Site Managers' extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

### Recording forms
- A standard field recording form is provided (Appendix II) for consistent data capture.

## Recording forms and data access
- Field forms and the standard data recording structure support consistent submission to the ECN network data systems.
- Access to the ECN data and transfer documentation is restricted; guidance and access are detailed via the ECNCCU contact.
