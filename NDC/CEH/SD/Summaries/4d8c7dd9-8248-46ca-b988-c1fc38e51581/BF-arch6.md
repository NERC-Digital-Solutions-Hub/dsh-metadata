# BF Protocol

## Aim
- To record the phenology of spawning of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in selected ponds and ditches.
- To assess the number of egg masses as an indicator of frog population health.
- To identify significant changes in populations and measure pond characteristics that may affect breeding success.

## Rationale
- Frog breeding occurs in shallow water; adult life largely on land, so conditions both on land and in breeding sites influence populations.
- Historical declines linked to agricultural drainage, habitat modification, and pollution; acidification and aluminium effects on larval stages are of interest.
- Spawn mass counts provide a rough population proxy (egg masses × 2 assumption) and spawn site accessibility aids monitoring.

## Method
- Site selection: one or more shallow ponds/ditches known to have bred recently and accessible for frequent visits.
- Monitoring schedule:
  - Weekly checks from around 1 January (adjustable by local knowledge) to determine when males congregate and begin calling.
  - If possible, daily visits from first spawning until eggs hatch; otherwise, minimum weekly visits.
  - After first eggs hatch, shift to weekly monitoring until metamorphosed frogs are seen or 16 weeks from first spawn, whichever is shorter.
- Spawn mass monitoring:
  - Record the date of first spawn; on each subsequent visit, record new spawn masses since the last visit.
  - Mark each new spawn mass with a colored thread to avoid double counting.
  - If counts exceed 100 masses or visits are infrequent, estimate total surface area of water occupied by spawn masses instead of counting new masses.
  - Record the date first embryos are seen to hatch; continue monitoring accordingly.
- Data collection for spawn and environment:
  - Daily or weekly counts of spawn masses and surface area; record dead/diseased eggs.
  - For less frequent sampling, surface area measurements are used.
- Weekly physico-chemical monitoring:
  - Collect a 250 ml pond water sample at first spawning for baseline chemical analysis.
  - Measure pH and conductivity on unfiltered water, then filter for analysis of major ions and constituents (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon).
  - If unexplained high mortality occurs, re-sample with the same suite of analyses.

## Equipment
- Field pH meter and maximum/minimum thermometer (for depth ~50 mm).
- Water depth measurement pole.
- Thread, bodkin needle, and other basic field supplies to mark spawn masses.
- Floating thermometer setup (float with a line to bank) to measure temperature at 50 mm depth.

## Location
- Pond(s) or wet ditches with recent frog breeding activity and accessible for frequent visits.
- Sampling and measurement locations chosen to capture relevant pond characteristics (e.g., three random positions near the edge for pH measurements).

## Biological
- Documentation of timing: onset of frog congregating, first spawning, first hatching, and first metamorphosed frogs leaving.
- Spatial and temporal variation considered due to UK-wide differences in breeding start times.

## Physico-chemical
- Annually, at first spawning: pond water sample analyzed for conductivity, pH, and dissolved ions/compounds (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon).
- Weekly measurements: pH (three positions near the spawning area at 50 mm depth), water depth at center of spawning area, and minimum/maximum temperatures.
- Data collection supports baseline comparisons and potential explanations for mortality events.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Data are captured using standardized core measurements with unique identifiers:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time
- Core measurement: vertebrates - frog spawn (BF Protocol) with detailed recording fields:
  - Pond ID and dates/tates: first seen congregating, first spawning, first hatching, newly metamorphosed frogs leaving
  - Pond sample details and physico-chemical measurements (pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions, etc.) with specified precision (e.g., 0.1 for pH; 3 significant figures for ions)
  - Recording conventions include daily spawn monitoring, weekly pond measurements, and consistent data formats.
- Data transfer documentation available for ECN dataset formats; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
- Recording forms: standard field recording form available from the CCU; Appendix II includes an example.
