# BF Protocol

- Aim
  - Record the phenology of spawning of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in selected ponds and ditches by counting egg masses as an indicator of frog population health.
  - Identify significant population changes and relate them to pond characteristics that affect breeding success.

- Rationale
  - The common frog serves as an indicator of amphibian health; populations are influenced by land conditions and shallow-water breeding sites.
  - Historical declines due to agricultural drainage, habitat modification, and pollution; concerns about acidification and aluminium effects on embryos and larvae.
  - Counting spawn masses provides a practical proxy for colony size; spawn is typically accessible in shallow water, enabling monitoring.

- Method (Overview)
  - Study sites: one or more shallow ponds or wet ditches known to breed frogs, chosen for ease of access and frequent visits.
  - Spawn monitoring
    - Record the date males congregate and begin calling; then monitor daily until first eggs hatch.
    - Attach a colored thread to each new spawn mass to avoid double counting.
    - For days with limited visits or many spawn masses, total surface area of water occupied by spawn may be estimated instead of counting every mass.
    - Record the date of first embryo hatching and, thereafter, monitor until metamorphosed frogs leave the pond or for up to 16 weeks from first spawning.
  - Environmental monitoring
    - Take a 250 ml water sample at first spawning for baseline chemical analysis.
    - Measure pH and conductivity on unfiltered water; after filtration, analyze for a suite of ions and other parameters.
    - If unexplained mortality occurs, re-sample for the same chemical determinands.
    - Weekly measurements during the spawning period:
      - pH at three random positions near the spawning edge at 50 mm depth.
      - Water temperature using a maximum/minimum thermometer at 50 mm depth.
      - Record water depth near the center of the spawning area.
  - Life-cycle recording
    - Document key dates: first sight of congregation, first spawning, first hatching, and first metamorphosed frogs leaving the pond.
  - Equipment
    - Field-ready pH meter, max/min thermometer, water depth pole; other equipment as needed to sample and measure pond conditions.
  - Recording conventions
    - Standardized data formats with core identifiers:
      - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/time.
    - Core measurement: vertebrates – frog spawn.
    - Data submission and dataset formats follow ECN data transfer documentation; access via ECNCCU.
  - Recording forms
    - Use the standard field recording form provided by ECNCCU (Appendix II as example).

- Data and reporting specifics
  - Core variables include:
    - Pond and sampling identifiers (site, core, location, date/time).
    - Spawn data: date first seen, number of new spawn masses, total surface area of pond covered by spawn, percentage of dead or diseased eggs.
    - Environmental data: pH, conductivity, alkalinity; measured concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P, dissolved organic carbon.
    - Physico-chemical measurements: depth at center, minimum and maximum temperature, and pH at multiple positions.
  - Data quality and formats
    - Precise measurement codes and units are defined for each parameter.
    - Regular data recording and time-stamped entries support long-term trend analysis and cross-site comparisons.
  - Purpose and usability
    - Designed for integration into ECN datasets to enable long-term environmental health monitoring, cross-site analyses, and policy performance assessment.

- Practical considerations
  - The protocol supports standardised long-term monitoring and data sharing to maximise dataset value across projects.
  - Emphasises access to underlying data and interoperability through central portals and documentation.
