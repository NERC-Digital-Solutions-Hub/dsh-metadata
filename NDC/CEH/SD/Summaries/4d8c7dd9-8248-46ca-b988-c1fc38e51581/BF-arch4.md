# BF Protocol

- Aim: Record the phenology of common frog (Rana temporaria) spawning in selected ponds and ditches by counting egg masses to indicate frog population health; identify significant changes and measure pond characteristics that may influence breeding success.

- Rationale: The common frog serves as an ecological indicator of amphibian status. Breeding timing and spawning success reflect conditions on land and in water, with historical declines linked to drainage, habitat modification, pollution, and acidification. Spawn counts provide a practical proxy for colony size given difficulties in monitoring adults.

- Method (FROG SPAWN):
  - Equipment: Field-use pH meter, maximum/minimum thermometer; optional water-depth pole.
  - Location: One or more shallow ponds or wet ditches with recent or known frog breeding, convenient for frequent visits.
  - Biological monitoring:
    - Record weekly from about January 1 (adjust by local knowledge) to determine when frogs congregate and begin calling; if possible, visit daily until first eggs hatch; minimum weekly visits if daily visits aren’t feasible.
    - Mark each new spawn mass with a coloured thread to avoid double-counting.
    - Estimate total surface area of water occupied by spawn and record the number of new spawn masses; note dead or diseased eggs.
    - If spawning is >100 masses or visits are infrequent, estimate surface area rather than counting new masses.
    - Record first hatch date; continue weekly monitoring after hatch until metamorphosis leaves the pond or for up to 16 weeks from first spawn.
  - Physico-chemical monitoring:
    - At first spawning, collect a 250 ml water sample for annual baseline chemical analysis; measure conductivity and pH in unfiltered water per ECN protocol, then filter and analyze major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P), alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.
    - If unexplained spawn or tadpole mortality occurs, collect an additional sample for the same analyses.
    - Measure pH, temperature, and water depth weekly from first spawning until newly metamorphosed frogs are observed leaving the pond.
    - pH: measure weekly at three random positions near the pond edge at 50 mm depth using a field meter.
    - Temperature: use a float-mounted maximum/min thermometer at 50 mm depth; record the temperature at first spawning and recheck weekly.
  - Data and reporting:
    - Record pond-specific timing (dates of first congregating frogs, first spawning, first hatching, and first metamorphosed frogs leaving).
    - Record pond water chemistry and physical measurements (pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions, T, depth) with precise measurement times and locations.
    - Use a standardized data structure and codes (see Data Specification) for consistent cross-site reporting.
  - References: Protocol builds on prior literature regarding frog status, acidification effects, and spawning ecology (listed in the document’s references).

- Specification of results and recording conventions:
  - Data are collected and stored using standardized ECN codes:
    - Site Identification Code (unique site code)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., frog spawn)
    - Location Code (sampling point within site)
    - Sampling Date/Time
  - Core measurements and variables (for frog spawn) include:
    - Pond ID and timing events (first congregating, first spawning, first hatching, first metamorphosed frogs leaving)
    - Spawn metrics (number of new spawn masses, total surface area covered, percentage dead/diseased eggs)
    - Water chemistry and physical measurements (pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions; temperature; depth)
  - Recording forms: Standard field recording form available; documentation and data transfer specifications are provided via ECNCCU’s data documentation on the restricted extranet.

- Recording forms: A standard field recording form accompanies the protocol (Appendix II in the document).
