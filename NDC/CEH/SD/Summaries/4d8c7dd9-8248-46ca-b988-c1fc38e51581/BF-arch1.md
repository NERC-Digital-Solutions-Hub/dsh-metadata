# BF Protocol

- Aim
  - Record the phenology of common frog spawning in selected ponds/ditches as an indicator of frog population health.
  - Identify significant changes in populations and measure pond characteristics that may affect breeding success.

- Rationale
  - Common frog biology and feeding patterns; breeding in shallow waters makes monitoring feasible.
  - historical declines linked to drainage, habitat modification, pollution, and acidification effects on embryos and larvae.
  - Spawn counts provide a rough population proxy; breeding sites are typically accessible for monitoring.

- Equipment
  - Field-ready pH meter and maximum/minimum thermometer (or equivalents).
  - Water depth measurement pole (and simple makeshift alternatives).

- Location
  - One or more shallow ponds or wet ditches known to breed frogs, chosen for convenient access and prior breeding activity.

- Biological observations (spawn monitoring)
  - Check timing: weekly from about January 1 (adjust for local knowledge); daily visits if possible until eggs hatch; minimum weekly visits if daily are not feasible.
  - Record the date frogs first congregate and begin calling; after spawning begins, monitor daily (or weekly) until first eggs hatch.
  - Mark each new spawn mass with colored thread to avoid double counting.
  - For each new spawn mass: record date seen, number of new masses, and the total surface area of water occupied by spawn.
  - Estimate percentage of dead or diseased eggs.
  - If visits are infrequent or spawn masses exceed 100, estimate total water surface area instead of counting new masses.
  - Record the date when embryos are first seen hatched; continue weekly monitoring until metamorphosed frogs leave or 16 weeks from first spawning, whichever comes first.

- Physico-chemical observations
  - At first spawning, collect a 250 ml water sample from the spawning area for baseline chemical characterization.
  - Measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water using ECN methods; after filtration, analyze for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4 3--P, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon.
  - If unexplained high mortality occurs, take a second sample with the same analyses.
  - Measure pH, temperature, and water depth weekly from first spawning to when metamorphosed frogs are seen leaving.
  - pH: measured weekly at three random positions just outside the spawning area at 50 mm depth using a field meter.
  - Temperature: use a maximum/min thermometer mounted on a buoyant float near 50 mm depth; recheck weekly.
  - Record the water temperature at first spawning and update weekly.

- Location and schedule details
  - Sites: shallow ponds/ditches accessible for frequent visits; historically known breeding sites preferred.
  - Sampling cadence: daily spawn monitoring during active spawning (where possible), weekly environmental measurements, and an annual pond water chemistry sample at spawning onset.

- Specification of results and recording conventions
  - Data are organized with four core identifiers for each sample: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date (and time if needed).
  - Core measurement: vertebrates – frog spawn (BF Protocol); annual pond water sampling with specified chemical determinands.
  - Data fields include: pond ID, dates of key events (first spawning, first hatching, first metamorphosed frogs leaving), number of new spawn masses, total surface area covered by spawn, depth at center of spawning area, minimum/maximum temperatures, pH at multiple positions, and concentrations of specified ions and parameters.
  - Recording precision is defined for each variable (e.g., 0.1 for pH/temperature/depth; significant figures for chemical determinands).
  - Data and recording formats are standardized and described in accompanying Data Transfer documentation; portal access provided by ECNCCU (e.g., ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk).

- Recording forms
  - A standard field recording form is available (Appendix II provides an example).
