# WD Protocol

## Aim
- Continuous recording of surface water discharge at ECN sites where the full catchment area lies within the ECN site.
- Monitor hydrological changes as environmental change affects water balance (climate, vegetation, soil).
- Use hydrological metrics as sensitive indicators of environmental change, especially where snow influences precipitation.

## Rationale
- Environmental change can alter site hydrology via climate, soil, and vegetation interactions.
- Changes in evaporation, soil moisture, and runoff will be reflected in measured discharge.
- Snow-dominated areas may show especially pronounced responses to climate change.

## Equipment Method
- Permanently installed weir or flume designed per site, following BS 3680 (Part 4A).
- Data logging with a Campbell Scientific CR10; supplementary analogue Ott chart recorder where possible.
- Dip-flash device for manual stage readings.
- Complete setup includes an approach channel, measuring structure, and downstream channel.

## Location
- Site selection criteria focus on: adequate regular channel length, regular velocity distribution, avoidance of steep channels, upstream water level effects, soil impermeability, flood bank capacity, and downstream stability.
- Full installation details described in BS 3680, Part 4A.

## Operation
- Logger records stage every 10 seconds; data averaged and stored in 5-minute blocks.
- Discharge (m3 s-1) derived from a rating curve and stored as 15-minute averages alongside stage for quality control and potential re-calculation if the rating changes.
- Calibration via development of a rating relationship using current meters across flow ranges; re-calibration every two years and if weir approach conditions change.
- Dip-flash datum checked every two years.
- Site staff perform quality control according to Appendix I.

## Procedure
- Fortnightly data workflow:
  1) Take dip-flash reading.
  2) Note times and stage on old/new Ott charts; update charts and synchronize clocks.
  3) Transfer data from Campbell logger to PC via storage module.
  4) Check battery voltage; service solar panel/backup battery as needed; preserve software if replacing battery.
  5) Inspect weir approach/crest for debris, sediment, or ice; clear carefully; store duplicate logger program and keep Ott charts for reference.

## Appendix I. Quality Control of Surface Water Discharge Data
- Validate that endpoints align with data removal times.
- Compare dip-flash and automatic stage readings at start/finish.
- Compare noon-stage values on days with steady flow.
- Record any missing data or ice-related interruptions.
-Document maintenance and changes for inclusion in the ECN database.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Core variables required for each WD sampling location:
  - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, Sampling Time.
- Automatic 15-minute interval records for each WD site:
  - Stage (average) and Discharge (average) with units: meters and cubic meters per second (cumecs).
  - Recording precision: 1 minute.
- Data submission practices reference accompanying Data Transfer documentation and ECN dataset formats; restricted access site manager extranet available for details.
