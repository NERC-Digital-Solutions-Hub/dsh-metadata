# WD Protocol

- Aim
  - Continuous recording of river discharge at ECN sites where the entire catchment lies within the ECN site.
  - Monitor hydrological responses to environmental change; use water balance changes (climate, vegetation, soil) as indicators; snow and climate change effects particularly relevant for sites with snow.

- Rationale
  - Hydrological conditions reflect climate and soil/vegetation changes.
  - Discharge and stage data can indicate environmental change sensitivity at a site.

- Equipment Method
  - Use a permanently installed weir or flume (BS 3680 Part 4A aligned) to measure stage.
  - Data recorded by a Campbell Scientific CR10 logger; supplemented by an analogue Ott chart recorder; a dip-flash device for manual readings.
  - A site-specific rating curve converts stage to discharge (m3 s−1); calibration via current meters across flow conditions every two years; dip-flash datum checked every two years.
  - Each site develops its own calibration protocol; ensure data quality control procedures are in place.

- Location
  - Complete installation: approach channel, measuring structure, downstream channel.
  - Site selection considerations: length of regular cross-section, regular velocity distribution, avoid steep channels, upstream water level effects, ground impermeability, flood banks, downstream stability.
  - Full details described in BS 3680, Part 4A.

- Operation
  - Logger records stage every 10 seconds; values averaged and stored over five-minute periods.
  - 15-minute discharge values computed from averaged stage using the rating relationship; both stage and discharge stored for quality control and potential recalculation if rating changes.
  - Calibration every two years and after changes in weir approach; duplication of logger program is recommended; Ott charts stored for reference.

- Procedure (Fortnightly data handling)
  - Download data to a PC via a storage module.
  - Steps: take dip-flash reading; record times and stages on old/new Ott charts; update charts and logger time; download data; verify battery and solar panel; ensure cables can move freely; clear debris/sediment/ice; maintain duplicate software copies.

- Appendix I. Quality control of surface water discharge data
  - Checks include: consistency of first/last data points with data removal times; cross-check manual and automatic readings at start/finish; compare 12:00 noon stage values on steady days; note missing data or frozen weir; document maintenance and changes for ECN database.

- Specification of results and recording conventions
  - Data submission requirements: sites submitting to ECNCCU must follow the accompanying Data Transfer documentation (restricted access via Site Managers' extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access).
  - Core measurement: surface water discharge (WD Protocol); variables recorded automatically at 15-minute intervals:
    - Site Identification Code (example: T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Recording date
    - Recording time
    - Stage (average) [unit: m]
    - Discharge (average) [unit: m3 s−1, cumecs]
  - Precision: Recording time precise to 1 minute; both Stage and Discharge precision to 0.001. Recording uses GMT 24-hour clock.
