# Macroinvertebrates of the Thames catchment

## Aim and scope
- Provide species-level descriptions of macroinvertebrate communities in wadeable rivers of the Thames catchment, UK.
- Include supporting habitat data.
- Cover three sampling seasons (Autumn 2009, Spring 2010, Autumn 2010) to support monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Data contents
- Taxon data: Macroinvertebrates of the Thames catchment - taxon data.csv (species-level abundances).
- Environmental variables: Macroinvertebrates of the Thames catchment - environmental variables.csv (habitat and site characteristics).
- Supporting information: Macroinvertebrates of the Thames catchment - supporting information.csv (site codes, names, coordinates, etc.).
- 18 sampling sites across the Thames catchment; not all sites sampled in every season.

## Study design and methods
- Waterbodies: Rivers within the Thames catchment, UK.
- Sampling: 18 sites; Autumn 2009, Spring 2010, Autumn 2010; not all sites sampled each occasion.
- Field protocol: 1 mm mesh kick net following RIvPACS protocol; recorded site variables (depth, width, substrate cover, macrophyte cover).
- Sample handling: Samples washed into bags, preserved with 4% formaldehyde in the field.
- Laboratory processing: Washed through 500 μm sieve; macroinvertebrates identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (usually species).
- Taxonomy: Valid names and unique taxon codes per Davies & Edwards (2011).
- Data processing: Data entry validated by crosschecking lab sheets; map variables derived using Intelligent River Network (Version 17).

## Taxonomy, codes, and data standards
- Taxon names and codes follow Davies, C. and Edwards, F.K. (2011) Code list for recording macroinvertebrates in freshwater in the British Isles.
- Unique taxon codes included in the taxon dataset.
- Sample identifiers defined by a unique combination of site code and sample date; site codes mapped in supporting information.

## Variables and datasets
- Taxon dataset columns (example): Site code, Sample date, Season (A/autumn, S/spring), Taxon code, Taxon name, Life stage, Abundance.
- Environmental variables dataset columns (example): Site code, Sample date, Wetted width, Water depth, % cover of rock pavement, % cover by substrate types, % cover by macrophytes.
- Supporting information dataset: Site code, Site name, Waterbody name, Easting, Northing, OS grid reference.

## Quality assurance and validation
- Data entry validated by crosschecking data printouts with laboratory sheets.
- Taxonomic and coding standards anchored to established references; map variables derived from standardized geographic data source.

## Geographic and temporal coverage
- Region: Thames catchment, United Kingdom.
- Seasons: Autumn 2009, Spring 2010, Autumn 2010.
- Sites: 18 sites; not all present in every season.

## Access, storage, and reuse
- Data prepared for storage and upload to appropriate portals (standardised formats and documented provenance).
- Datasets and supporting information provided as CSV files with clear column headings and codes.
