# Macroinvertebrates of the Thames catchment

## Overview
- Species-level descriptions of macroinvertebrate communities from wadeable rivers in the Thames catchment, UK.
- Samples collected across three seasons: Autumn 2009, Spring 2010, Autumn 2010.
- 18 sampling sites; not all sites sampled at every occasion.
- Includes supporting habitat data.

## Data files and structure
- Data files:
  - Macroinvertebrates of the Thames catchment - taxon data.csv
  - Macroinvertebrates of the Thames catchment - environmental variables.csv
  - Macroinvertebrates of the Thames catchment - supporting information.csv
- Taxon dataset columns:
  - Site code, Sample date, Season (A = autumn, S = spring), Taxon code (per Davies & Edwards 2011), Taxon name, Life stage (L = larva/nymph, P = pupa, A = adult, U = life stage not relevant), Abundance in sample
- Supporting information columns:
  - Site code, Site name, Waterbody name, Easting, Northing, OS grid reference
- Environmental variables columns:
  - Site code, Sample date, Wetted width (m), Water depth (cm), % cover of rock pavement, % cover of boulders/cobbles, % cover of pebble/gravel, % cover of sand/clay, % cover by macrophytes
- Sampling identifiers:
  - Each sample is defined by a unique combination of site code and sample date

## Data collection and methods
- Study area: rivers of the Thames catchment, UK
- Protocol: RIvPACS field protocol; 1 mm mesh kick net
- Site variables recorded: depth, width, substrate cover, macrophyte cover
- Sample processing: washed into bags in the field, preserved in 4% formaldehyde
- Laboratory processing: samples washed through a 500 μm sieve; macroinvertebrates identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level (usually species)
- Taxon codes: based on Davies, C. & Edwards, F.K. (2011) Code list for recording the macroinvertebrates in freshwater in the British Isles
- Data validation: entry validated by cross-checking with laboratory sheets
- Spatial context: map variables derived using Intelligent River Network (Version 17)
