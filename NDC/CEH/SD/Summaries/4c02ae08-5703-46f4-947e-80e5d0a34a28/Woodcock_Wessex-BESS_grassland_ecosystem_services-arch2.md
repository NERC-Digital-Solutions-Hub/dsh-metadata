# Experimental data on herbivorous pest insects, predatory insect occurrence and population growth rates of artificially established aphids from three crops

## Aim
- Assess the potential for different grassland types (improved, restored, species-rich) to provide natural pest control ecosystem services.
- Use sentinel plants of three crops to monitor herbivorous pests, predatory insects, and aphid population growth in relation to grassland type.
- Conducted as part of the Wessex Biodiversity Ecosystem Services Sustainability (BESS) project (NERC) in 2013 on five farms in Salisbury Plain, UK.

## Study design and setting
- Grassland treatments: agriculturally improved (low diversity, MG6/MG7), restored to high diversity within the last 10 years, and species-rich (CG2/CG3) grasslands not agriculturally improved in the last 50 years.
- Grazed grasslands (not mown) replicated on three farms; fields spaced at least 10 km apart.
- Field setup: 15 fields (3 fields per farm; one field per grassland treatment) with sentinel plants for each crop.
- Sentinel plants: oilseed rape (3 pots), wheat (3 pots with 10 tillers each), field beans (3 pots with 3 plants each).
- Greenhouse pre-growth to mimic field flowering/seed set times.
- Aphid inoculation: subset of plants inoculated to ensure aphid presence (wheat with Rhopalosiphum padi; field bean with Aphis fabae).
- Monitoring period: plants remained until full phenological development; observations conducted from late May to mid-July 2013.

## Data collected and monitoring approaches
- Aphid populations (Aphid_2013.csv): mean aphid numbers per site across sentinel crops (wheat and field bean) with date, days in field, site, treatment, crop, and mean aphid counts. Aphids counted weekly (counts to nearest 10 during peak periods).
- Predator abundance (Predator_2013.csv): mean counts of predator species associated with sentinel plants, across sites and treatments.
- Herbivore counts (Herbivore_2013.csv): mean counts of herbivores feeding on sentinel crops, with notes on crop type and site-specific data; field notes include deer-related damage in oilseed rape causing data gaps (NA).
- Plant community composition (Plants_2013.csv): mean percentage cover of vascular plant species per site based on five 1×1 m quadrats; includes site, treatment, and cover percentages.
- Metadata outlines (Aphid_2013.csv, Predator_2013.csv, Herbivore_2013.csv, Plants_2013.csv): key fields such as date of observation, days exposed, site identifier, treatment, crop, species names, and quantitative measures.

## Quality assurance and data management
- Data checked for anomalous values after entry; identification of invertebrates verified against museum reference materials (Oxford University Museums of Natural History).
- Metadata documents clear: site-level descriptors, taxa names, and measurement units.
- Data handling aligned with standardized approaches for environmental monitoring outputs (reports, maps, charts).
- Datasets designed for storage and upload to appropriate data portals to support ongoing monitoring and policy-relevant analyses.

## Implications for monitoring and data reuse
- Enables comparison of natural pest control potential across grassland types, contributing to ecosystem services assessments.
- Standardised data structure supports integration with other environmental datasets and broader monitoring initiatives.
- Provides underlying data for transparency and scrutiny of ecological health and agrienvironment policy performance over time.
- Addresses challenges of increasing dataset value by allowing cross-dataset analyses and broader data accessibility beyond single-use applications.
