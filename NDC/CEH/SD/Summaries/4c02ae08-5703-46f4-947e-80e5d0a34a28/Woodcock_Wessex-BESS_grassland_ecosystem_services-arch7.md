# Experimental data on herbivorous pest insects, predatory insect occurrence and population growth rates of artificially established aphids from three crops.

- Purpose and scope
  - Assess potential of different grassland types (improved, restored, species-rich) to provide natural pest control ecosystem services.
  - Use sentinel plants of field bean, wheat, and oilseed rape to monitor herbivorous pests, predatory insects, and aphid population growth.
  - Conducted in 2013 on five farms in Salisbury Plain, UK, as part of the NERC BESS programme.

- Study design and sampling
  - Grassland treatments:
    - Agriculturally improved (low diversity) MG6/MG7 NVC class.
    - Restored to high plant diversity within last 10 years (agri-environment scheme).
    - Species-rich CG2/CG3 grassland not agriculturally improved in last 50 years.
  - Replication: 3 farms; 15 fields total (3 fields per farm; one field per grassland type on each farm).
  - Sentinel plants placed 2/6/2013; plants included wheat, field beans, and oilseed rape.
  - Experimental setup: greenhouse-grown plants prior to field deployment; crops inoculated with aphids to assess effects of local predator populations.
  - Monitoring:
    - Aphids inoculated on subset: field beans (2 pots per field) and wheat (5 tillers per pot) with aphids (wheat Rhopalosiphum padi; field bean Aphis fabae).
    - Weekly counts of aphids to assess predator impact; counts aggregated to site-level averages.
    - Sampling of free-living predators (spiders, Coccinellidae, predatory beetles) on four dates; hand sorting and identification.
    - Sampling of free-living pests on sentinel plants on the same dates.
    - Plant community composition: five 1x1 m quadrats per site to measure vascular plant cover.
  - Observations documented on dates around mid-June 2013 with additional notes.

- Data collection details
  - Aphid data (Aphid_2013.csv): mean aphid numbers per site; fields include date, days in field, crop (field bean or wheat), site, grassland treatment, and average aphid counts.
  - Predator data (Predator_2013.csv): mean predator counts per site; fields include predator species, site, treatment, and average counts.
  - Herbivore data (Herbivore_2013.csv): mean herbivore counts per site; fields include species, site, treatment, crop, and average counts; note missing data for oilseed rape due to deer damage.
  - Plant cover data (Plants_2013.csv): mean percent cover of plant species per site; fields include species, site, treatment, and cover percentage.
  - Metadata for each dataset describes data types and units (e.g., date, days_exp, cover percentages, mean counts).

- Data quality and provenance
  - Quality checks completed to identify anomalous values after data entry.
  - Invertebrate identifications verified against museum references (Oxford University Museums of Natural History).
  - Affiliated with NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Wallingford (UK).

- Geographic and temporal context
  - Five farms located on Salisbury Plain, United Kingdom.
  - Fieldwork conducted in 2013.
  - Sites represented 15 grassland fields (3 fields per farm) across three grassland treatment types.

- Potential GIS applications and considerations
  - Spatial visualization of grassland treatments and associated pest/predator dynamics across landscapes.
  - GIS-friendly integration of site-level data with habitat type, crop type, and temporal observations to model natural pest control services.
  - Consideration of data gaps (e.g., missing oilseed rape data due to deer damage) and the availability of site identifiers without explicit geographic coordinates in metadata.
