# Experimental data on herbivorous pest insects, predatory insect occurrence and population growth rates of artificially established aphids from three crops

- Authors and affiliation: Woodcock, B.A.; Bullock, J.M.; Pywell, R.F. – NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Wallingford, UK.

- Purpose and scope:
  - Assess the potential of different grassland types (improved, restored, species rich) to provide natural pest control ecosystem services.
  - Monitor herbivorous pest insects, predatory insect occurrence, and population growth rates of artificially established aphids on sentinel plants of three crops.

- Study context and timing:
  - Conducted in 2013 on five farms in the Salisbury Plain area, UK.
  - Part of the Wessex Biodiversity Ecosystem Services Sustainability (BESS) project within the NERC BESS programme.

- Design and treatments:
  - Grassland types:
    - Agriculturally improved (low diversity) MG6/MG7.
    - Restored to high plant diversity within the last 10 years (UK agri-environment scheme).
    - Species rich CG2/CG3 grasslands not agriculturally improved in the last 50 years.
  - Field setup: replicated on three farms (15 fields total; 5 fields per grassland type).
  - Planting and crops: sentinel plants of field bean, wheat, and oilseed rape placed in each field; plants greenhouse-grown to approximate field phenology.
  - Inoculation: aphids introduced on wheat and field beans (wheat with Rhopalosiphum padi; field bean with Aphis fabae) on a subset of plants to evaluate predator effects.
  - Monitoring cadence: weekly aphid counts; multiple sampling dates for natural enemies and pests; plant diversity assessments conducted mid-July.

- Data collection and measures:
  - Predator sampling: hand sorting and observation targeting spiders, Coccinellidae, predatory beetles, and other natural enemies.
  - Pest sampling: counts of herbivores on sentinel plants to characterize pest pressure.
  - Plant community: percentage cover of vascular plants via five 1x1 m quadrats per site.
  - Observational scope: 15 grassland sites across 5 farms; site-level averages computed for each measure.

- Quality assurance and data validation:
  - Anomalous values checked post-entry; invertebrate identifications verified against museum material (Oxford University Museums of Natural History).

- Metadata and datasets available:
  - Plants_2013.csv: mean percentage cover by plant species; site and grassland treatment (I=improved, R=restored, SR=species rich); cover percentages.
  - Aphid_2013.csv: mean aphid counts by date, crop, site, and treatment; aphid species noted for each crop.
  - Predator_2013.csv: mean predator counts by site, treatment, and predator species.
  - Herbivore_2013.csv: mean herbivore counts on sentinel plants by site, crop, and treatment (with noted data loss for oilseed rape due to deer damage).
  - Metadata fields include date, days in field, site identifiers, treatment codes, crop type, and various mean counts/cover metrics.

- Data governance and accessibility notes:
  - Underpinning data are organized for transparency and reuse, with explicit metadata and quality checks.
  - Data are described with units and categorical descriptors, facilitating cross-site comparability and future policy-relevant analyses.
