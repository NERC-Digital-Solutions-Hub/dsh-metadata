# Diatom samples were collected from sediments in the Hampshire Avon catchment across 2013

## Overview
- Collects diatom samples from multiple sites in the Hampshire Avon catchment during 2013.
- Results from diatom counts are paired with biotic and abiotic analyses (McKew et al. 2016).
- Data are structured to support downstream analysis and potential ecological assessments.

## Sampling design and labeling
- At each site: 5 sediment cores (8 cm internal diameter) within a 25 m river reach.
- From each core: 4 sub-cores (2 cm internal diameter) taken to pair measurements.
- Sample labeling: SITECODE - REPLICATE (1–5).
- Site codes encode: underlying geology (C = chalk, A = clay, G = greensand), river name (E = Ebble, A = Avon, N = Nadder, W = Wylye, S = Sem).
- Each sample is listed comprehensively, including when data are missing.

## Sample processing and storage
- Diatom community analysis cores fixed on site with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in universal tubes.
- On-site preparation: vortex mix 5 s; sonicate 10 min to resuspend attached algae.
- Large-pore pipette tips used to transfer ~2 ml to a centrifuge tube; centrifuged at 2300 rpm for 15 min to pellet.
- Pellet washed to remove excess glutaraldehyde; replaced with 0.5 ml UPH water and 2 ml saturated KMnO4; left for 24 h.
- Stepwise HCl treatment: add 5 ml 32% HCl, heat at 80°C for 1 h; centrifuge and wash; repeated to remove HCl.
- Pellet resuspended in UPH water and centrifuged; repeated five times to ensure HCl removal.
- Clean samples mounted on slides with Naphrax; slides analyzed microscopically.

## Diatom analysis and counting
- Microscopy: Leica Ortholux (1000×) with diatoms identified to species level where possible.
- A minimum of 300 diatoms identified per sample.
- Identification references used: Hartley (1996); Kelly (2000); Kelly et al. (2000); Kelly et al. (2008).
- Diatom counts are qualitative raw counts due to methodological approach.

## Data products, provenance, and integration
- Outputs include diatom counts and species identifications, paired with accompanying biotic/abiotic measurements (McKew et al. 2016).
- Data are organized by site, replicate, and core-derived measurements to enable self-serve analysis and integration with other datasets.
- The dataset supports ecological status assessment approaches in UK rivers using diatoms (referenced works).

## Limitations and notes
- Counts are qualitative raw counts, not absolute abundance measures.
- Methodologically driven, with fixed preparation and staining steps that influence data type.
