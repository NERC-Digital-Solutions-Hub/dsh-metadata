# Diatom samples were collected from sediments in the Hampshire Avon catchment across 2013.

## Overview
- Study conducted in the Hampshire Avon catchment during 2013.
- At each site, 5 sediment cores (8 cm inner diameter) were collected within a 25 m river reach.
- From each core, 4 sub-cores (2 cm inner diameter) were taken to pair measurements.
- Diatom counts are paired with biotic and abiotic analyses (McKew et al. 2016).
- Samples are labeled with SITECODE - REPLICATE (1–5); site codes encode geology, river name, and river number.

## Sampling Design and Dataset Structure
- Site codes are built from:
  - Underlying geology: C = chalk, A = clay, G = greensand
  - River name: E = Ebble, A = Avon, N = Nadder, W = Wylye, S = Sem
- Each sample is listed comprehensively, including instances with no data.
- Replicates (1–5) enable within-site comparisons and replicate analysis.

## Laboratory Methods and Data Content
- Diatom community analysis cores fixed on-site with 0.5% glutaraldehyde.
- Sample preparation included vortex mixing, sonication, designed to resuspend algae.
- Large-pore handling: 2 ml mixed solution decanted, centrifuged (2300 rpm, 15 min) to pellet material.
- Chemical cleanup sequence: replace excess glutaraldehyde with UPH water, add KMnO4, incubate 24 hours, then 5% HCl digestion with heating at 80°C for 1 hour; repeat washes to remove HCl.
- Pellets resuspended, centrifuged as above; steps repeated to ensure cleanliness.
- Slides mounted with Naphrax and analyzed under a Leica Ortholux microscope (1000x).
- Diatoms identified to species level where possible; minimum of 300 diatoms identified per sample.
- Identification references include Hartley (1996); Kelly (2000); Kelly et al. (2000); and McKew et al. (2016).
- Data units are qualitative raw counts (not calibrated abundances).

## Data Content, Provenance, and Linking
- Counts are qualitative and reported as raw counts.
- Diatom counts are paired with biotic/abiotic measurements described in McKew et al. (2016).
- Methods and labeling imply traceability from field collection to laboratory analysis.

## Metadata, Standards, and Documentation
- Samples are labeled with SITECODE-REPLICATE, enabling traceability across analyses.
- Site code semantics (geology, river, and geography) are embedded in labels for context.
- Documentation cites primary methodological sources for diatom identification and analysis.

## Data Stewardship Considerations and Challenges
- Metadata completeness: ensure site geology, river identity, and replicate information are consistently captured.
- Data standards and interoperability: methods are specialized (glutaraldehyde fixation, KMnO4/HCl digestion); document steps to facilitate reproducibility and integration with other datasets.
- Data storage and versioning: preserve raw counts alongside analysis mappings to McKew et al. 2016; track updates if linking to additional analyses.
- Data sharing: ensure linkage to the McKew et al. 2016 dataset and full methodological references; consider providing per-sample metadata (SITECODE, REPLICATE, geology, river) for reuse.
- Handling of incomplete data: since samples are listed even when data are missing, clearly annotate missing values to prevent misinterpretation.
- Future interoperability: align labeling conventions with common diatom and ecological datasets to ease cross-study integration.
