# Diatom samples were collected from sediments in the Hampshire Avon catchment across 2013

- Sampling design
  - Sites located within the Hampshire Avon catchment; at each site, 5 sediment cores (internal diameter 8 cm) were collected within a 25 m river reach.
  - From each core, 4 sub-cores (internal diameter 2 cm) were taken to pair measurements.
  - Samples are labeled SITECODE - REPLICATE (1–5).
  - Site codes encode: underlying geology (C = chalk, A = clay, G = greensand), river name (E = Ebble, A = Avon, N = Nadder, W = Wylye, S = Sem), and river number.
  - For ease of future analysis, each sample is listed even where data exists or does not exist.

- Sample processing and storage
  - Diatom community analysis cores fixed on site with universal tubes containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde.
  - Sediment samples vortex mixed briefly (5 s) before being sonicated for 10 minutes to resuspend attached algae.

- Diatom analysis method
  - Diatom community composition assessed using an adapted Trophic Diatom Index method.
  - After sonication, samples vortex mixed for 10 s.
  - Procedure to prepare slides:
    - Use cut standard pipette tips to create wide mouths; transfer 2 ml of mixed solution to a centrifuge tube.
    - Centrifuge at 2300 rpm for 15 min to pellet material.
    - Remove excess glutaraldehyde; replace with 0.5 ml UPH water and 2 ml saturated KMnO4.
    - After 24 hours, add 5 ml of 32% HCl; heat in a water bath at 80°C for 1 hour.
    - Centrifuge again (2300 rpm, 15 min) and remove supernatant.
    - Resuspend pellet in 2 ml UHP water and centrifuge; repeat this washing step 5 times to remove HCl.
  - Mount prepared samples on microscope slides using Naphrax.
  - Analysis: Leica Ortholux light microscope (1000×) to identify diatom frustules to species level where possible.
  - Taxonomic identification references: Hartley (1996); Kelly (2000); Kelly et al. (2000).

- Data and scale
  - Diatom counts are qualitative; units are raw counts.
  - A minimum of 300 diatoms identified for each sample.

- Data linkage and context
  - Diatom counts are paired with measurements of biotic and abiotic analyses from McKew et al. (2016).
  - Each sample’s dataset is prepared for integration with related biotic/abiotic data, with sample labels facilitating cross-referencing.
