# Diatom samples were collected from sediments in the Hampshire Avon catchment across 2013.

## Overview
- Collection period and scope: Diatom samples collected from sediments in the Hampshire Avon catchment during 2013.
- Purpose alignment: Data intended to support paired analyses with biotic and abiotic measurements (McKew et al. 2016) and to enable future analyses through standardized labeling.

## Sampling design and labeling
- Sampling structure: At each site, 5 sediment cores (8 cm internal diameter) were taken within a 25 m river reach; from each core, 4 sub-cores (2 cm internal diameter) were used to pair measurements.
- Replication and labeling: Each sample is labeled as SITECODE - REPLICATE (1-5); per-site 5 replicates are collected.
- Site code composition: Site codes encode underlying geology, river name, and river number:
  - Underlying geology: C = chalk, A = clay, G = greensand
  - River name: E = River Ebble, A = River Avon, N = River Nadder, W = Wylye, S = River Sem
- Data organization: Each sample is listed in the dataset even if data are missing, to facilitate future analysis.

## Diatom analysis workflow
- Sample preparation on-site: Diatom community analysis cores fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde; samples vortexed briefly and sonicated to resuspend algae.
- Quantitative analysis method: Diatom community composition assessed using an adapted Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) method.
- Processing steps: 
  - Large-particle uptake using cut pipette tips
  - 2 ml solution decanted to centrifuge tube; centrifuged at 2300 rpm for 15 min to form a pellet
  - Excess fixative removed; replaced with 0.5 ml UPH water and 2 ml saturated KMnO4
  - After 24 hours, 5 ml 32% HCl added; heated at 80°C for 1 h
  - Centrifuged again; supernatant removed; pellet resuspended in 2 ml UHP water and centrifuged
  - This HCl removal cycle repeated 5 times
- Slide preparation and analysis: Cleaned samples mounted on slides with Naphrax; analysed using a Leica Ortholux microscope at 1000x; diatom frustules identified to species where possible.
- Taxonomic references: Identification supported by Hartley (1996); Kelly (2000); Kelly et al. (2000).
- Count thresholds: A minimum of 300 diatoms identified per sample.
- Data units: Counts are qualitative and reported as raw counts.

## Data structure, provenance, and outputs
- Data pairing: Diatom counts are paired with biotic and abiotic measurements reported in McKew et al. (2016).
- Metadata and traceability: Detailed sample labeling (SITECODE-REPLICATE) and site codes enable traceability and future re-analysis.
- Elevating data usability: Methodological steps and references are documented to support reproducibility and comparison with other studies.

## Data quality, governance, and sharing considerations
- Quality assurance: On-site fixation, standardized processing, and validated references underpin data quality and comparability.
- Metadata richness: Comprehensive labeling and procedural detail enhance metadata completeness for governance and reuse.
- Data sharing considerations: While the dataset links to published analyses (McKew et al. 2016) and uses standard references, explicit public data-sharing arrangements are not detailed in the document; data provenance and openness are addressed via detailed methodology and references.
