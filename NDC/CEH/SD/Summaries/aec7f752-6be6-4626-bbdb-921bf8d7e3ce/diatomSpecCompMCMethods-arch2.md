# Diatom samples were collected from sediments in the Hampshire Avon catchment across 2013

## Overview
- Aims to assess environmental condition over time by generating diatom-based data paired with biotic and abiotic measurements.
- Data are organized to support standardised monitoring outputs (e.g., reports, maps, charts) and stored for ongoing accessibility.

## Sampling design and site metadata
- At each site, 5 sediment cores (8 cm internal diameter) collected within a 25 m river reach.
- From each core, 4 sub-cores (2 cm diameter) taken to pair measurements.
- Sample labeling: SITECODE - REPLICATE (1-5); Site codes encode underlying geology and river identity:
  - Geology: C = chalk, A = clay, G = greensand
  - River name: E = Ebble, A = Avon, N = Nadder, W = Wylye, S = Sem
- All samples listed in the dataset, even where data are missing, to facilitate future analyses.

## Laboratory methods and diatom analysis
- Diatom cores fixed on-site with 0.5% glutaraldehyde.
- Preparation included vortexing, sonication, and extensive rinsing to prepare diatom material.
- Quantitative diatom community analysis using an adapted Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) method (Kelly et al., 2008).
- Processing steps included centrifugation, chemical digestion (KMnO4, HCl with repeated rinses), and mounting on slides with Naphrax.
- Microscope analysis at 1000x; species-level identification where possible.
- A minimum of 300 diatoms identified per sample.
- Diatom identifications referenced to Hartley (1996), Kelly (2000), and Kelly et al. (2008).
- Outputs are qualitative counts (raw counts) due to methodological constraints.

## Data integration and outputs
- Diatom counts are paired with biotic/abiotic measurements from McKew et al. (2016) to enable integrated analyses of carbon and nitrogen cycling and other processes.
- Primary outputs include raw diatom counts and derived indices (e.g., adapted TDI) suitable for ecological assessment and monitoring.
- Data structure supports cross-site comparisons and multilayer environmental health assessments.

## Data management and accessibility
- Data created in a standardized format and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals to ensure availability for monitoring and policy analysis.
- Metadata encoding (site, replicate, geology, river name) facilitates data linkage with other environmental datasets and future analyses.

## Context and references
- Core methodological references and related ecological status assessment tools:
  - Hartley, 1996; Kelly, 2000; Kelly et al., 2008 (diatom identification and ecological status framework)
  - McKew et al., 2016 (biologic/abiotic context: carbon and nitrogen cycling in river sediments)

## Key considerations for monitoring purposes
- Standardised approach enables consistent tracking of environmental health over time.
- The dataset is designed for integration with other environmental data to enhance value beyond single-use analyses.
- Provides a robust basis for reporting and policy evaluation through qualitative diatom counts complemented by cross-referenced measurements.
