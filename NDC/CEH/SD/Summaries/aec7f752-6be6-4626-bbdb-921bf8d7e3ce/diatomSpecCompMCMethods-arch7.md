# Diatom samples were collected from sediments in the Hampshire Avon catchment across 2013

## Sampling design
- Collected diatom samples from sediments in the Hampshire Avon catchment during 2013.
- At each site, 5 sediment cores (internal diameter 8 cm) were taken within a 25 m long river reach.
- From each core, 4 sub-cores (internal diameter 2 cm) were taken to pair measurements.
- Sub-cores were stored according to the analyses performed.
- Diatom counts are paired with biotic and abiotic measurements (McKew et al. 2016) for each sample.

## Site labeling and data organization
- Each sample is labeled SITECODE - REPLICATE (1-5).
- Site codes encode:
  - Underlying geology: C = chalk, A = clay, G = greensand
  - River name: E = River Ebble, A = River Avon, N = River Nadder, W = Wylye, S = River Sem
- Samples are listed for ease of future analysis, even where data may be missing.

## Laboratory processing and diatom analysis
- Diatom community analysis cores fixed on site with universal tubes containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde.
- Sediment vortexed briefly, then sonicated for 10 minutes to resuspend algae.
- Centrifugation and washing steps to prepare clean diatom suspensions:
  - 2 ml mixed solution decanted, centrifuged at 2300 rpm for 15 minutes to pellet material.
  - Glutaraldehyde removed; replaced with UPH water and KMnO4; repeated washing to remove glutaraldehyde and then HCl.
  - Samples cleaned through repeated centrifugation and washing (5 cycles total).
- Mounted on microscope slides with Naphrax®; analyzed with Leica Ortholux microscope (1000x).
- Diatom frustules identified to species level where possible; minimum of 300 diatoms identified per sample.
- Identification references include Hartley (1996); Kelly (2000); Kelly et al. (2000).

## Data outputs and integration
- Results from diatom counts are qualitative; units are raw counts.
- Diatom data are paired with biotic and abiotic measurements from McKew et al. (2016).
- The dataset includes all samples, with site and replicate identifiers and the corresponding geological/river encodings.

## Diatom identification and references
- Methods follow an adapted Trophic Diatom Index (Kelly et al., 2008) for ecological assessment in UK rivers.
- Key references for diatom identification and methodology:
  - Hartley, 1996
  - Kelly, 2000
  - Kelly et al., 2008
  - McKew et al., 2016 (carbon and nitrogen cycling in river sediments; related context)

## GIS considerations and usage
- Potential for map-based visualizations of diatom data linked to:
  - Site location within the Hampshire Avon catchment
  - Underlying geology (chalk/clay/greensand)
  - River identity (Ebble, Avon, Nadder, Wylye, Sem)
- Data quality and standardization notes:
  - Data are qualitative raw counts; integration with other quantitative datasets may require normalization.
  - Site coding and geology/river encodings enable spatial querying and layering with GIS datasets.
  - Data may be incomplete at some sites (mentions that all samples are listed even when data are missing).
