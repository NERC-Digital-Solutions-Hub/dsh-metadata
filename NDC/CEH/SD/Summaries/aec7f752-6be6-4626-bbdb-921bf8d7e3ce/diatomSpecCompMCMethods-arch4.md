# Diatom samples were collected from sediments in the Hampshire Avon catchment across 2013.

## Overview
- Diatom counts from sediment samples were collected in 2013 across the Hampshire Avon catchment.
- Results are paired to biotic and abiotic analyses described in McKew et al. (2016).
- Each sample is labeled with SITECODE - REPLICATE (1-5) to enable traceability and pairing with measurements.

## Sampling design and labeling
- At each site, 5 sediment cores were collected within a 25 m river reach.
- From each core, 4 sub-cores (2 cm diameter) were taken to pair measurements.
- Site codes encode: underlying geology (C=chalk, A=clay, G=greensand), river name (E=Ebble, A=Avon, N=Nadder, W=Wylye, S=Sem), and river number.
- Data are listed for ease of future analysis, including samples with no data.

## Sample processing and diatom analysis
- Diatom community analysis cores (a single sub-core) fixed on site with 0.5% glutaraldehyde.
- Sediment briefly vortex-mixed, then sonicated for 10 minutes to resuspend algae.
- Diatom counts conducted using an adapted Trophic Diatom Index method.
- Processing steps include:
  - Centrifugation at 2300 rpm for 15 minutes to pellet material.
  - Removal of excess glutaraldehyde, replacement with UPH water and KMnO4 solution.
  - Oxidation with 5 mL of 32% HCl after 24 hours, then heating at 80°C for 1 hour.
  - Repeated centrifugation and washing to remove HCl (repeated 5 times).
  - Pellets resuspended in UPH water and centrifuged as above.
  - Samples mounted on slides with Naphrax®, analyzed via Leica Ortholux microscope (1000×).
- A minimum of 300 diatoms were identified per sample.

## Data produced and identification
- Diatoms identified to species level where possible using Hartley (1996); Kelly (2000); Kelly et al. (2000).
- Outputs are qualitative and in raw counts (not standardized or converted to densities).
- Data are linked to other analyses in McKew et al. (2016): Carbon and Nitrogen cycling in river sediments over a seasonal cycle in the Hampshire Avon catchment.

## Data provenance, metadata, and references
- Methods and data are documented with explicit procedural steps to support reproducibility.
- Key references for diatom identification and ecological assessment are cited:
  - Hartley, 1996
  - Kelly, 2000
  - Kelly et al., 2008
  - McKew et al., 2016 (paired analyses)
  - Kelly et al., 2005 (diatom key)

## Data quality, limitations, and accessibility
- Data are qualitative counts, not absolute abundances.
- The sampling design ensures traceability through SITECODE-REPLICATE labeling and site geology codes.
- Data availability emphasizes completeness of labeling (listing samples even when data are missing) to facilitate future analysis.
- The document references where diatom counts are integrated with broader biogeochemical analyses for the Hampshire Avon catchment.
