# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with thanks to volunteers.
- Purpose: annual data on butterfly population status across the UK to understand changes and inform biodiversity policy.

## Data collection and structure

- Sampling framework includes:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes, 2–4 km, 26 counts per year, weekly from April to September.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects; 2–3 visits per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
- Coverage: over 2,000 standard transect sites, plus WCBS and targeted surveys; data from all methods are analyzed together.
- Data collected include counts of all butterfly species along transects and across survey methods.

## Data quality and governance

- Data recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
- Quality checks include:
  - Automatic entry checks for anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators review data for questionable records.
  - Automated and manual validation to flag records outside known distributions, atypical flight periods, first-time site records, or extreme abundances.
  - Corrections are made via bespoke queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders as needed.

## Nature and format of the data download

- Content: annual indices of abundance for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, covering 1976–2019.
- Format: CSV (comma-separated values).
- Columns described:
  - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
  - COUNTRY: country used for the regional collated index
  - SPECIES CODE: unique species identifier
  - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea 2.2)
  - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (Emmet & Heath)
  - YEAR: year of the collated index
  - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at that site and year; -2 indicates insufficient data to calculate an index
