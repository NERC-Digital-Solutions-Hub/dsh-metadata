# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers provide essential data contributions.
- Purpose: annual data on butterfly population status to understand insect population changes and inform biodiversity policy questions.
- History and scope: running since 1976 with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year; data from all sampling methods are analyzed together.
- Website and resources: more details available at the UKBMS website.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- Abundance indices: UKBMS produces seasonal abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts. Site indices reflect a constant proportion of the population, with detectability varying by species.
- Trend indexing: annual species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with site-year weighting to reflect the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed that year.
- Data sources for indices: counts from Pollard walks (standard transects), WCBS, and targeted surveys are all used to estimate seasonal patterns and fill gaps in recording.

## Quality control

- Data collection: field data on standard forms; online entry via UKBMS data site or Transect Walker before upload to a central database.
- Automated checks: immediate validation in data entry software to flag anomalous counts or records outside flight periods.
- Regional validation: regional transect coordinators review data and perform ongoing checks during the season.
- Further validation: automated and manual procedures to identify records outside known distribution ranges, abnormal flight periods, first-time site records, and extreme or unusual abundances.
- Corrections: data queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders lead to edits in the UKBMS dataset as needed.

## Details of this data download

- Content: annual abundance indices for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, covering 1976–2019.
- File format: comma-separated values (.csv).
- Columns:
  - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
  - COUNTRY: region used for regional collated index
  - SPECIES CODE: unique species identifier
  - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea standard)
  - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (Emmet & Heath standard)
  - YEAR: year of the collated index
  - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site-year; -2 indicates insufficient data to calculate a reliable index
