# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with volunteers contributing data.
- Sampling framework comprises three components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts up to 26 times/year, 5 m wide band, ~2000 sites/year.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year, ~750 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species.
- Data since 1976, with over 2500 actively recorded sites annually, are analyzed together to address policy questions on butterfly status and biodiversity trends.
- Further details available at the UKBMS website: http://www.ukbms.org/.

## 2. Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- UKBMS produces abundance indices (relative measures) for butterfly populations rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of the true population, though detectability varies by species.
- Indices for species are produced by combining site indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (developed in 2016) with a weighting adjustment: data from each site/year are weighted by the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed that year.
- All counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS are used to estimate the seasonal pattern and extrapolate to account for recording gaps; weighting emphasizes observed data over extrapolated data.
- Methodologies link to more intensive measures (e.g., mark-release-recapture) for validation.

## 3. Quality control

- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker before being uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods); recorders may adjust or proceed with records.
- Each site has a regional transect coordinator who validates records; ongoing checks by coordinators occur throughout the season.
- Additional automated and manual validation includes checks for species outside known distribution, records outside normal flight periods, first-time site records, and anomalous abundances; data corrections are performed via queries and coordinated edits.

## 4. Details of this data download

- This download provides annual abundance indices for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, from 1976 to 2019, in CSV format.
- Columns include:
  - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
  - COUNTRY: region used for regional collated index
  - SPECIES CODE: unique species identifier
  - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea 2.2)
  - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (Emmet & Heath, 1990)
  - YEAR: year of the collated index
  - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year (value -2 indicates insufficient data)
