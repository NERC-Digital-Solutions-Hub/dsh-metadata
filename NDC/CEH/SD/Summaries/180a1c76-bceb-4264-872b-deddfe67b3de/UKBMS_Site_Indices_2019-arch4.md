# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - Annual data on butterfly population status across the UK, used to understand biodiversity trends and inform policy questions.
  - Operated by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and Joint Nature Conservation Committee; relies on volunteers.
  - Since 1976, with over 2500 actively recorded sites each year.

- Sampling framework and data types
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m width, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) from April to September.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts using alternative methods.
  - All data methods are analyzed together to produce annual abundance indices.

- Data processing and trend analysis
  - Indices are relative measures of population size (not absolute counts).
  - Collated species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with site- and year-specific weighting based on flight period coverage.
  - Seasonal patterns estimated from all counts to fill gaps and extrapolate to obtain robust indices; observed counts have greater influence than extrapolated data.

- Quality control and data governance
  - Field data collected on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Built-in automatic checks for data entry errors; regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
  - Additional automated and manual validation to flag out-of-range records, out-of-period records, first-time site records, extreme or atypical counts; corrections made through queries and coordinators.

- Data download details
  - Includes annual abundance indices for each species at each site with sufficient data (1976–2019).
  - Delivered as a CSV file with columns:
    - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
    - COUNTRY: country contributing to regional index
    - SPECIES CODE: unique species identifier
    - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea)
    - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (Emmet & Heath)
    - YEAR: year of the collated index
    - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year (value -2 indicates insufficient monitoring to compute an index)
