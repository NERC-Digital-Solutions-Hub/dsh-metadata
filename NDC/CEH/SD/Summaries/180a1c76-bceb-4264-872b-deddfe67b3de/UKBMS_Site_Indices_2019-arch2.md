# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Aim for Analysts: Use standardized, open data to demonstrate environmental health and policy performance over time; support scrutiny of biodiversity status and trends.

- What it is and who runs it:
  - A long-running, funded collaboration of Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteer data collection across the UK; more than 2,500 actively recorded sites annually.
  - Outputs inform policy questions related to biodiversity status and trends.

- Data collection framework and methods:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide belt, weekly counts Apr–Sept (up to 26 counts/year), ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year (minimum 2 visits in July/August), ~750 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focused on specific species.
  - All data methods are analyzed together to produce annual abundance indices, reflecting relative population sizes.

- Nature of the data and trend analysis:
  - Indices are relative, not absolute counts; reflect proportion of butterflies present at a site.
  - Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) combines site indices into species-wide collated indices, with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed that year to balance observed versus extrapolated data.

- Data quality control:
  - Field recording on standard forms; online entry via UKBMS data portal or Transect Walker software.
  - Automatic checks highlight data entry errors; regional transect coordinators validate data throughout the season.
  - Additional validation to flag records outside known distributions, out-of-season records, first-time site records, and anomalous counts; corrections made via queries and coordination with observers.

- Details of this data download:
  - Provides annual abundance indices for each species at each well-sampled UK site, for 1976–2019.
  - Data format: CSV with columns:
    - SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX
  - SITE INDEX may be -2 if insufficient data to calculate an index.

- Licence and attribution:
  - Open Government Licence (OGL); allows free use with few conditions.
  - Must cite the dataset and include the provided attribution: Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and Joint Nature Conservation Committee.

- Collaboration and contact:
  - UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset use and interpretation; opportunities for co-authorship and input for scientific outputs.
