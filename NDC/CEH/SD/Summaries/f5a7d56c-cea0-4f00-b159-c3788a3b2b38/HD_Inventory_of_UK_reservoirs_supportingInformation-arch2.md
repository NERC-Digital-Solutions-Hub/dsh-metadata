# Historic Droughts

- Four-year, £1.5m project (2014–2018) funded by UK Research Councils, aiming to develop a cross-disciplinary understanding of past UK droughts to improve drought management tools.
- Involved eight UK institutions: British Geological Survey, Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Cranfield University, University of Exeter, HR Wallingford, Lancaster University, the Met Office, and University of Oxford.
- Context: Droughts and water scarcity threaten livelihoods; parts of the UK are water-stressed and face pressures from population growth and resource exploitation; droughts are influenced by hydrometeorological, environmental, regulatory, social, and cultural factors.
- Core deliverable: Historic Droughts Inventory – a knowledge base of past drought characteristics, drivers, impacts, and responses to support consistent planning for policymakers, water suppliers, agriculture, and industry.

## Inventory overview

- Combines two main elements to enable multi-sectoral understanding:
  - Hydro-meteorological timelines: rainfall, river flows, groundwater with consistent drought indicators; records extended to the 19th century through modelling and data rescue.
  - Historical references: drought mentions from newspapers, legislation, agricultural media, and oral histories (19th century to present) with time/place metadata and links to full sources.
- Structure is aligned with international efforts (based on EDII references) but broadened to include drought drivers and responses, not only impacts.

## Motivation

- Seeks to understand water resource system drivers and responses to droughts, with emphasis on the spatial and temporal distribution of reservoir construction nationally.
- A coherent reservoir dataset is needed to examine system changes and potential drivers of those changes.

## Methods

- Inventory purpose: capture information on reservoirs important for water supply, prioritizing larger reservoirs to support analysis of storage, inflows, and outflows.
- Data integration:
  - Upstream and downstream gauging data via NRFA; incorporation of historic reconstructed streamflow (Smith et al. 2018).
  - Historic reservoir storages from CEH; links signposted to relevant data.
- Design for usability: filtering-friendly with a compact set of data columns; notes section for additional context.

## Preparation and data quality

- Data sources include:
  - Environment Agency (2017) Reservoir Safety (Open Licence)
  - UK Lakes Portal (CEH)
  - Internet sources and references
- Data quality varies; flagged with a data flag system and notes to indicate uncertainties.
- Reservoir inclusion criteria:
  - Up to 1,600 Ml storage (covering about 90% of Reservoirs Act 1975 capacity); smaller reservoirs included if part of larger groups with sufficient information.
- Reference sources catalogued (Hansard, government departments, water companies, journals, peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed books, and other websites); a referenced selection process is documented.

## Using the data

- Delivered as CSV files with a referenced references file (HD_Inventory_of_UK_reservoirs_references.csv) to accompany the inventory.
- Key columns (examples):
  - Reservoir name, location coordinates (Ordnance Survey grid), storage volume (Ml), upstream/downstream NRFA gauges, planning and completion dates, reservoir type, timeseries group, initial use, notes.
- Data are designed for easy filtering and cross-referencing to support multi-sectoral drought analyses and historical system-change investigations.

## Implications for environmental monitoring and analysis

- Provides a standardized, multi-sectoral dataset linking drought indicators with reservoir system characteristics and historic drivers.
- Enhances transparency and supports policy makers, water suppliers, and industry in understanding past droughts and planning for future water resource management.
- Demonstrates an approach to combining hydrometeorological data with socio-regulatory context, while openly sharing data sources and quality caveats to enable broader reuse.
