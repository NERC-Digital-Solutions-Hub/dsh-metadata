# Discovery metadata- Soil nutrients, soil pyrogenic carbon, soil bulk density and roots dry weight under different intensities of soil management in the Colombian Andes between 2019-2021

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides datasets on soil nutrients, soil pyrogenic carbon, soil bulk density, and roots dry weight.
  - Collects under different intensities of soil management along an altitudinal gradient in Andean Colombia.
  - Aims to understand drivers of variation in forest resilience and the effects of perturbation on ecosystem functioning.
  - Part of the BioResilience project, funded by UK NERC (NE/R017980/1).

- Study design and sampling
  - 27 permanent forest monitoring plots, each 0.5 hectares.
  - Locations span lowlands, midlands, and highlands along an altitudinal gradient.
  - Disturbance gradient categories: low, medium, high perturbation, with recovery times specified.
  - Plots distributed across five locations, covering diverse ecological contexts.
  - Data collected 2019–2022 (plot establishment and soil sampling aligned with the BioResilience framework).

- Data content (four CSV files)

  - dryweigthbr.csv
    - Variables include: Plot_code, Ecosystem, Land_use, Municipio, Departamento, Depth, Dry_weight.
- Data collection and processing methods
  - Pyrogenic carbon
    - TOC (%C_bulk) measured by elemental analysis (Costech ECS-4010).
    - Pyrogenic carbon (Cpyc) measured via hydrogen pyrolysis (HyPy).
    - Cpyc%/CBulk calculated from HyPy results; D13C corrections per Wurster et al. 2012.
  - Soil nutrients
    - pH: shaken soil-water suspension (10 g soil with 25 mL water) and measured with automatic probe.
    - Available P: sequential extraction (resin, 0.5 M NaHCO3, 0.1 M NaOH, 1 M HCl).
    - Total P: acid digestion (H2SO4) with H2O2 (Tiessen & Moir reference).
    - Particle size: Bouyoucos method for sand, silt, clay.
    - Exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, Na: Ag-TU extraction (Pleysier & Juo).
  - Bulk density
    - Pit samples collected and oven-dried to constant weight for bulk density calculation.
  - Dry weight (roots)
    - Roots dried to determine dry weight per plot and depth.
- Calibration, quality control, and data validation
  - Instrument calibration and reference value establishment before measurements.
  - External review of database structure and metadata; checks for missing values, duplicates, and data typing.
  - Metadata validation for accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
  - Emphasis on accuracy, completeness, and consistency to ensure reliability for monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Nature and units of recorded values
  - pyrogeniccarbonbr.csv: %C_(Bulk), Lower/Median/Upper D13C_(pyc) in ‰, Cpyc_(%), %Cpyc/Cbulk, %OC (all with specified ranges and units).
  - soilnutrientbr.csv: pH (water), p_available (mg/kg), tot_p (mg/kg or % as indicated), sand/clay/silt (%), Ca_ex/Mg_ex/K_ex/Na_ex (cmolc/kg).
  - bulkdensitybr.csv: Depth (cm), Bulk_density (g/cm3), date, location identifiers (Municipio, Departamento, Farm), Land_use, Ecosystem.
  - dryweigthbr.csv: Dry_weight (g), Depth (cm), Ecosystem, Land_use, location identifiers.
- Data structure and accessibility
  - Four csv files collectively titled to reflect pyrogenic carbon, soil nutrients, bulk density, and dry weight.
  - Plot_code serves as a unique key linking records across files.
  - Data are organized to support cross-tabulation by ecosystem, land use, depth, altitude, and perturbation level.
- Context and references
  - Linked to the BioResilience project, addressing forest resilience after Colombia’s post-conflict period.
  - References key methods for pyrogenic carbon quantification and soil analysis (e.g., HyPy, Quesada et al., Tiessen & Moir, Wurster et al.).
- Practical usage notes for analysts
  - Use plot_code to merge datasets across the four CSV files for integrated analyses.
  - Consider altitude and perturbation category as primary stratifiers when assessing soil properties and forest resilience.
  - Leverage standardized measurement and QC procedures to compare with other monitoring datasets and over time.
