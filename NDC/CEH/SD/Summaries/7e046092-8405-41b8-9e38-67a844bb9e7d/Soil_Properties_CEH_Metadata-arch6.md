# Dataset Description (Soil_Properties_CEH)

- This dataset describes soil physical and chemical properties across unlogged tropical forest, logged tropical forest, and oil palm plantation sites in Sabah, Malaysia. Data were collected March–April 2015 as part of the NERC-funded BALI project and analysed at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Lancaster, UK.

- Data file: Soil_Properties_CEH.csv with 15 columns. Column definitions and units are provided in the accompanying metadata.

## Data file and columns

- Soil_Properties_CEH.csv contains 15 columns:
  - Identifier, Site, Land_Use, Plot_Name, Subplot, Horizon, Soil_Moisture, Horizon_Depth, Bulk_Density, Soil_pH, total_C, total_N, Inorganic_P, C:N, C:P
- Metadata provides descriptions and units for each column (e.g., Soil_Moisture, Horizon_Depth, Bulk_Density, Soil_pH, total_C, total_N, Inorganic_P, C:N, C:P).

## Sampling design and collection methods

- 9 one-hectare plots across 3 sites representing land-use types: unlogged tropical forest, logged tropical forest, and oil palm plantation.
  - Sites: Danum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA), Maliau Basin Conservation Area (MBCA), and SAFE project area.
- Stratified sampling: each 1 Ha plot subdivided into 25 subplots (20 x 20 m); 5 subplots per plot were sampled.
- 5 samples collected per subplot using a gouge auger; organic layer depth measured and separated from mineral soil; samples sealed in Ziploc bags.
- Bulk density: separate sample collected with a bulk density ring; stones removed, samples dried to determine bulk density.
- Measurements:
  - Soil moisture: gravimetric method
  - pH: measured on fresh soil with calibrated pH meter
  - Total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N): oven-dried, ground soil analysed with LECO Truspec
  - Inorganic phosphorus (P): Bray No. 1 extractant, analysed with SEAL AutoAnalyser
- Sampling scale yielded 100 samples per forest type and 25 samples from oil palm.
- Timeframe of collection: March–April 2015.

## Measurements and analytical methods

- Soil_Moisture: gravimetric (percentage)
- Horizon_Depth: depth in cm
- Bulk_Density: g/cm^3
- Soil_pH: numeric pH value
- total_C: mass percentage or numeric representation of total carbon
- total_N: mass percentage or numeric representation of total nitrogen
- Inorganic_P: concentration (µg/g)
- C:N and C:P: ratios (numeric)
- Horizon: soil horizon sampled
- Plot_Name, Subplot: plot and subplot identifiers
- Site, Land_Use: geographical and land-use context

## Metadata and data quality

- Metadata provides a detailed description of each field, including units/format and meaning, enabling correct interpretation and reuse.
- Missing data: 3 missing samples from oil palm plots; these are the only missing data points reported.

## Potential uses and applications

- Enable cross-site comparisons of soil properties among unlogged forest, logged forest, and oil palm systems.
- Support analyses of how land-use changes affect soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus dynamics, soil moisture, bulk density, and pH.
- Facilitate data-driven insights for land management, restoration planning, and policy discussions.
- Data can be explored and visualized via self-serve data products or integrated into dashboards focusing on soil health across landscapes.
