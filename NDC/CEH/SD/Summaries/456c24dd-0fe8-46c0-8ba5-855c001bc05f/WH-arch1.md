# WH Protocol

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; slowing this deterioration relies on filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations) acidification.
- Some steps require laboratory training, experience, specialised equipment, and safety compliance; guidance from chemists may be needed.

## Sample handling and timing

### Initial storage
- Store samples at 1–4°C if more than seven hours will pass before measurements.
- Return to cold storage if filtration is not completed on the same day as measurements.
- If sending to another site, ship the same day; use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks during transit.

### Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Express results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.

### pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample.
- The same subsample can be used for both conductivity and pH, but conductivity must be measured first and the subsample not returned to the main sample.
- Use the method (HMSO 1978/1988) implying separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Express results to 0.01 pH unit.

### Data handling and metadata (data quality and provenance)
- Use unique sample codes and document filtering details for each sample.
- Label containers with ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler/instrument codes.
- Submit final data with the unique reference for discoverability in the ECN database.
- Record measurement methods and precision (conductivity to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹; pH to 0.01 pH unit).

## Filtering
- Filtering must occur within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I methods.
- After filtration, analyze for dissolved: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (DOC not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient, follow the priority order specified in the AG Protocol.
- For samples with volumes >100 mL, take a 20 mL subsample for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µL HCl.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1–4°C.
- Analysis should be completed preferably within 16 days, but definitely within 28 days.
- If sending to another location, minimize time out of cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

## Data handling and metadata
- Document all data sources, methods, and sample identifiers.
- Ensure data are discoverable and usable by including metadata and adhering to ECN database requirements.

## Safety, training, and references
- Some steps require laboratory training, experience, and compliance with health and safety requirements.
- Guidance may be sought from chemists performing analyses.
- References include HMSO methods for conductivity (1978) and pH (1988).

## Appendix I. Filtering (equipment and procedure)
- Equipment:
  - Filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil; 47 mm filters)
  - Membrane filters (Whatman WCN, 0.45 µm)
  - Glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C)
  - Vacuum pump (≈0.5 bar vacuum)
- Procedures:
  - Thoroughly rinse all filter parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples.
  - Do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; each filter used for a single sample.
  - For soilsolution (SS) and rivers (WQ), pre-filter through a glass fibre filter; rinse filters with 250 mL distilled water before use.
  - If volume >100 mL, transfer a 20 mL subsample to a vial for Al and Fe, acidify with 20 µL HCl.
- Labeling:
  - Containers must be labeled with ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler/instrument codes.
- Suppliers:
  - BDH (for cleaning and reagents)
  - Millipore (UK) Ltd (filtering supplies)

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers must be washed with a lab cleaning agent before first use and approximately every six months or after heavy soiling.
- Cleaning agent should be phosphate- and hypochlorite-free.
- Suitable cleaning options include Decomatic (preferred) or Decon-90 (overnight soaking) if no machine is available.
- Rinse steps: four rinses with tap water and three with deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times with distilled water and reuse with the same sampler.
- Drying and storage: shake to remove water, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, then recap immediately.
