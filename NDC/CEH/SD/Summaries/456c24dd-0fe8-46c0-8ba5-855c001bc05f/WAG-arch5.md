# WAG Protocol

## Overview and Aim
- Establishes analytical guidelines for water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
- Requires laboratories to perform analyses under controlled conditions with documented methodologies, significant methodological changes, and validation procedures.
- Annual review of procedures by an Analytical Working Group with representatives from each laboratory.
- Defines approved techniques and targets detection limits to ensure comparability across sites.

## Approved Analytical Techniques
- Determinands covered include pH, conductivity, major ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al), nutrients (NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P, SO4-S, Cl, HCO3-), DOC, and Total N.
- Alternative techniques are allowed (indicated with notes), but methods may not quantify directly the species of interest; comparability tests are required when switching methods.
- Common reference approaches referenced (e.g., HMSO Blue Books, AAS, IC, colormetric methods).
- Emphasis on reporting the fraction specified (e.g., NO3-N vs nitrate) and monitoring alternate techniques for bias to confirm absence of bias.
- For pH and conductivity, refer to the Initial Water Handling Protocol; ensure low ionic strength measurements use appropriate procedures and electrodes.

## Reference Techniques and Data Quality
- Maintains a set of reference methods to compare new or alternative methodologies.
- Laboratories should report results with clear method references, units, and ultimate detection limits.
- Reporting formats include the fraction of interest (e.g., SO4 as S) and specify the reference technique used.
- Laboratories must document method changes with new data records stamped by date; maintain records of instrument maintenance, calibration, drift, and staff training.

## Data Reporting and Metadata
- Each data record corresponds to a determinand for a site, linking site, core measurement, date, and methodology with its precision.
- An example is provided (nitrate via ion chromatography) to illustrate data record structure.
- Summary methodology information is stored in the ECN meta-database for operators, enabling traceability and provenance of results.

## Priority Determinants When Sample Volume is Limited
- In low rainfall periods, sample volumes may be restricted; a priority list guides analytical choices:
  - 1) pH and conductivity
  - 2) Anions: NO3-, SO4^2-, PO4^3-, Cl-
  - 3) Cations: Ca^2+, Mg^2+ (then K^+, Na^+)
  - 4) NH4+-N
  - 6) Fe^2+, Al^3+ (requiring separate acidified aliquots)
  - 5) DOC
  - 7) Total N and alkalinity

## Validation, Accuracy, and Precision
- Validation relies on approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC, plus participation in interlaboratory schemes (e.g., AQUACHECK).
- Accuracy reflects closeness to true values and community agreement; accuracy checks must be recorded and corrective measures noted if applicable.
- Precision is controlled via QC samples; laboratories must report QC data to Site Managers and must not submit data if QC fails.

## Quality Control and Interlaboratory Comparison
- A separate ECN QC system is available to complement independent in-house QC and interlaboratory comparisons.
- Encourages ongoing participation in interlaboratory exchanges to validate performance and establish inter-site correction factors.
- Two concentrated QC solutions (one for cations, one for anions) are prepared annually and distributed to sites for the following year.
- QC procedures include preparing, analyzing, and documenting QC solutions in the same manner as samples, with dedicated preparation dates and batch records.
- Data transfer for QC: QC data are submitted to the ECN Central Coding Unit (CCU) in the same dataset as samples, including batch preparation dates and measured values for all determinands.
- A Moor House QC record example demonstrates the required data fields and format (free-format, comma-separated).

## Data Management and Documentation Practices
- Method changes require a new dated record in the ECN database to preserve a complete history.
- Central governance ensures uniform detection limits and comparability across laboratories.
- Site managers and ECN data managers handle QC data formats, data integration, and traceability.

## Governance and Data Stewardship Implications
- Standardize and document analytical methods, including versioning and change control, to maintain data quality and comparability.
- Maintain comprehensive metadata for each determinand, including method, detection limits, calibration, and QC performance.
- Ensure data quality through mandatory participation in interlaboratory checks and through structured QC procedures.
- Manage data provenance by linking results to methodology records, dates, and sites within a centralized meta-database.
- Enforce data sharing standards by requiring consistent reporting formats and fractions, with bias monitoring when alternate techniques are used.
- Facilitate data discoverability and reuse by maintaining auditable records of methodology changes, validation results, and accuracy/precision assessments.
