# WAG Protocol

- Aim
  - Provide analytical guidelines for water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
  - Labs must analyze under controlled conditions, document methodologies and significant changes, and validate procedures.
  - Annual review by an Analytical Working Group; establish detection limits as targets.

- Scope and responsibilities
  - Each laboratory manages its resources; participating labs document methodology and validation.
  - Protocols subject to annual review; changes tracked.

- Approved techniques and determinands
  - Determinands include pH, conductivity, major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, HCO3-), DOC, Total N, alkalinity.
  - Multiple alternative methods are allowed (e.g., AAS, ICP/OES, ion chromatography, colorimetric methods) with notes on which methods quantify specific species.
  - pH and conductivity have special considerations for low ionic strength waters; reference to Initial Water Handling Protocol.

- Reference techniques and comparability
  - Reference techniques provided for each determinand to enable comparison and assessment of alternative or new methods.
  - Laboratories must report the fraction measured (e.g., SO4 2- as S) and monitor potential biases if using different techniques.

- Reporting methodology and data management
  - Method details stored at the laboratory; summary information stored in the ECN database.
  - One data record per determinand per site, linking methodology, site, core measurement, and date to indicate precision and approach.

- Validation: accuracy and precision
  - Validation via approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC; participation in interlaboratory schemes (e.g., AQUACHECK).
  - Accuracy: assessed by inter-laboratory agreement; record accuracy checks and corrective measures; example accuracy record provided.
  - Precision: controlled using synthetic QC solutions; QC data reported with results; interlaboratory checks encouraged.

- Quality control procedures
  - Separate QC system for ECN participants; laboratories encouraged to use independent QC and interlaboratory exchanges.
  - Potential to compute between-site correction factors; approach helps detect rogue batches and long-term trends.
  - Merlewood prepares two QC concentrates (cation and anion) annually for distribution; sites analyze QC solutions like samples.

- Procedure for QC solutions
  - Prepare QC solutions just before first determinand analysis; acidify appropriate samples; analyze QC like other solutions.
  - Maintain continuity by yearly preparation of new concentrates and cross-check with previous year’s solutions.

- Data transfer and QC data format
  - QC data submitted to ECN CCU in a free-format, comma-separated dataset with specific fields (measurement code, site ID, QC sample code, preparation dates, analysis dates, pH, conductivity, determinands, etc.).
  - Includes a Quality code field for optional codes.

- Priority listing when sample volume is limited
  - 1 (highest): pH, conductivity
  - 2: NO3-, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, Cl-
  - 3: Ca2+, Mg2+, then K+, Na+
  - 4: NH4+-N
  - 5: DOC
  - 6: Fe2+, Al3+ (separate acidified portions)
  - 7: Total N, alkalinity

- Cross-references and logging
  - See Initial Water Handling Protocol for sample handling, filtration, pH adjustment, and acidification.
  - Any methodological changes generate a new data record with a timestamp; assess data suitability for purpose.

- Example and governance
  - Includes example accuracy record (e.g., SO4 2- measured by ion chromatography) and notes on documenting corrections and interlaboratory comparisons.
  - Authors and signatories: Rowland, Woods, Lane (with revisions to the protocol).
