# WAG Protocol Aim ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provide guidelines for analyzing water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
  - Laboratories are responsible for their resources but must conduct analyses under controlled conditions and document methodology, changes, and validation.
  - Analytical procedures are reviewed annually by an Analytical Working Group with representatives from each laboratory.

- Approved techniques and reference methods
  - Multiple approved techniques exist for each determinand (with notes on which methods quantify which species).
  - Examples include:
    - pH and conductivity using established HMSO/Blue Book references.
    - Cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al) with AAS or ICP/OES.
    - Anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, Cl-) with ion chromatography or related methods; ammonium and total N with indophenol blue, etc.
    - Alkalinity by HMSO methods; DOC by combustion or colorimetry; Total N by Kjeldahl or persulphate/NO3.
  - Some techniques do not quantify the exact species directly but are suitable after comparative tests; laboratories must consider bias when using alternative methods.

- Data management of methodology
  - Details of methods should be kept in-lab; summary information is stored in the ECN database.
  - One data record per determinand per ECN site, linked to site, core measurement, and date, documenting methodology, precision, and any changes.
  - Laboratories must record changes in methodology with a date stamp and include instrument maintenance, calibration, drift, and training in the record.

- Validation, accuracy, and precision
  - Validation is maintained via approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC; participation in interlaboratory schemes (e.g., AQUACHECK) is required.
  - Accuracy: closeness to true value; monitored through control samples and external schemes; results and any corrections must be recorded.
  - An example accuracy record illustrates reporting results, method, lab, date, and percentage relative error, with corrective actions noted if any.

- Precision and quality control
  - Precision controlled using synthetic QC solutions; QC data reported to Site Managers with each batch.
  - Interlaboratory studies are complemented by internal QC; aim to enable between-site correction factors and long-term trend detection.
  - A separate QC system is provided for ECN participants; labs should maintain independent QC validation and consider joining external interlaboratory schemes.

- Preparation and use of QC solutions
  - Two concentrated QC solutions (one for cations, one for anions) prepared at Merlewood; distributed annually to sites.
  - Protocol for preparing diluted QC solutions and conducting analyses in the same manner as samples; includes separate QC handling for pH/conductivity if managed locally.

- Data transfer and reporting of QC data
  - QC data must be submitted to the ECN database in a machine-readable format, with batch-level records for both anions and cations.
  - The data record layout includes: measurement code, site ID, QC sample code, preparation dates, analysis dates, pH (unstirred and stirred), pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions, DOC, Total N, and a quality code.
  - An example Moor House QC record demonstrates the format and fields, including quality fields as needed.

- Priority listing of determinands (handling limited sample volumes)
  - When sample volume is limited, the following priority applies:
    - 1: pH, conductivity
    - 3: Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ first; then K+, Na+)
    - 2: Anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, then PO4 3-, Cl-)
    - 4: NH4+-N
    - 6: Fe2+, Al3+ (requiring separate acidified aliquots)
    - 5: DOC
    - 7: Total N, alkalinity

- Documentation, updates, and discoverability
  - All methodological details and changes are to be documented and traceable in the ECN database.
  - The protocol highlights the need for consistency across sites, with clear notes on method suitability and potential bias when employing alternative techniques.

- Additional notes
  - For pH measurement, procedures should quantify low ionic strength solutions with appropriate electrode considerations.
  - For conductivity and pH, refer to the Initial Water Handling Protocol as applicable.
