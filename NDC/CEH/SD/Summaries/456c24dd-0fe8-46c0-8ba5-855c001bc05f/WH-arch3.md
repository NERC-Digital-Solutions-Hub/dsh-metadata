# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Preservation methods: filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations) acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, specialised equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background quality control procedures are described in related documents.

## Initial storage
- Store at 1°C–4°C if the interval between collection and measurement of conductivity/pH exceeds seven hours.
- If filtering is not completed on the same day, return to cold storage.
- If samples are sent to another site, ship the same day by the fastest possible method.
- In transit, keep samples in a cool box with pre-frozen cold blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Use the method given by HMSO (1978).
- Express results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm⁻¹).

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample (same subsample as conductivity).
- Conduct conductivity measurement first; do not return the subsample to the main sample.
- Use the method given in HMSO (1988), implying separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Express results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

## Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I methodology.
- Record filtering details with unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyze for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (DOC not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient, use the priority order described in the AG Protocol.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1°C–4°C.
- Aim to analyse within 16 days, and definitely within 28 days of collection.
- If samples must be sent to another location, minimize out-of-cold storage by next-day delivery and related measures.

## Washing bottles (general protocol)
- See Appendix II for detailed washing procedures.

## Appendix I. Filtering (summary of content)
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly, membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters, vacuum pump (≈0.5 bar).
- Handling: rinse all parts with deionised/distilled water before first use and between samples; do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; single filter per sample.
- Pre-filtering: soils solution (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtering; rinse pre-filters with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- Subsampling: if >100 ml sample, transfer 20 ml to a vial for Al/Fe determination and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labeling: containers must include ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler code; this pairing should appear with final data in the ECN database.
- Suppliers: listed contacts for ECN protocol materials and filters.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Cleaning agents: use a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Decontamination: Decon or Decon-90 (if no washing machine, overnight soaking in Decon-90).
- Rinsing: four taps with tap water and three rinses with deionised/distilled water.
- After use: rinse three times with distilled water, re-cap to reuse with the same sampler.
- Drying and storage: shake to dry, warm-air dry in a dust-free environment, re-cap immediately.
- Decon products can be obtained from listed suppliers.
