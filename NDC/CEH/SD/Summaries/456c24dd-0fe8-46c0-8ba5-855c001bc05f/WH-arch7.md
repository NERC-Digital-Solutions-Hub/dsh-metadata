# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water.
- To filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; slow deterioration with filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe) acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background and quality control procedures are detailed in referenced documents.

## Initial storage Method
- Store at 1–4°C if the interval to measurement >7 hours.
- Return to cold storage if filtering is not completed the same day.
- If sending to another site, ship the day of collection; use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks during transit.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Use the HMSO (1978) method; express results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; same subsample as conductivity (conductivity first; do not reintroduce into main sample).
- Use HMSO (1988) method; express results to two decimal places (0.01 pH units).

## Filtering
- Filtering within 60 hours of collection; follow Appendix I method.
- Record filtering details using unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyze for dissolved Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH4⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO3⁻-N, SO4²⁻, PO4³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; optional for precipitation).
- If insufficient sample volume, refer to the chemical analysis protocol (prioritization of determinands).
- Separate documentation for chemical analysis; ensure a unique reference appears in the ECN database.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Storage temperature: 1–4°C.
- Analysis ideally within 16 days of collection, but no later than 28 days.
- If sending to another location, minimize out-of-cold-storage time; prefer next-day delivery and avoid Friday dispatch.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assemblies (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membrane filters (Whatman WCN, 0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
- Handling: rinse all filter apparatus with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples; do not touch contact surfaces; use forceps; one filter per sample.
- Pre-filtering: for soils (SS) and rivers (WQ), may require pre-filtering through a glass fibre filter; wash filter with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- Subsampling: if volume >100 ml, transfer 20 ml to a vial for Al and Fe determinations and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labeling: containers must include ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler code; ensure data submitted to ECN database includes this identifier.
- Suppliers: referenced (BDH, Millipore) with contact details.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers washed with a laboratory cleaning agent before first use and then approximately every six months or after high soiling.
- Cleaning agent should be phosphate- and hypochlorite-free.
- Cleaning methods: Deconatic/Decon-90 soaking if no washing machine; then four rinses in tap water and three rinses in deionised/distilled water.
- After washing: shake dry, air-dry in a dust-free environment, re-cap immediately.
- Decon products available from multiple suppliers (e.g., BDH).
