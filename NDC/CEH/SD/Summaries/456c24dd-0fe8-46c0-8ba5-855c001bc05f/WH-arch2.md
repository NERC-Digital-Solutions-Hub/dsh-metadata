# WH Protocol

## Aim
- INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001): To measure conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate after collection due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Deterioration is slowed by: filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations only) acidification.
- Activities may require laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background and quality control procedures are provided in related documents.

## Initial storage
- Store samples cold (1°C–4°C) if more than seven hours before measuring conductivity and pH.
- Return to cold storage if filtration is not completed the same day.
- If sending to another site, ship on the day of collection by fastest method.
- In transit, use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Use the specified HMSO method; express results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample (same subsample as conductivity; measure conductivity first and do not return subsample to main sample).
- Use HMSO (1988) method with separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Express results to 0.01 pH units.

## Filtering
- Filtering within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I method.
- Record filtering details with unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyze for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻-P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (DOC not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient, priority order for determinands is provided in the accompanying chemical analysis documentation.
- For samples >100 mL, transfer a 20 mL subsample for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µL HCl.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Storage temperature: 1°C–4°C.
- Ideally analyze within 16 days of collection; must be completed within 28 days.
- Minimize time outside cold storage if samples are sent to another location (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

## Washing bottles
- See Appendix II for bottle washing method.

## Documentation and sample identifiers
- Use unique references on all containers and data submissions:
  - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
  - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date
  - Additional sampler code (e.g., SS sampler code)
- Unique reference should appear with final data for ECN database submission.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment:
  - Filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil; 47 mm filters)
  - Membrane filters: Whatman WCN, 0.45 µm (BDH/BDH catalogue)
  - Glass fibre filters: Whatman GF/C
  - Vacuum pump (approx. 0.5 bar)
- Procedures:
  - Thoroughly rinse all filter parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples.
  - Do not touch water-contact surfaces with hands; use forceps; one filter per sample.
  - For soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ), pre-filter through glass fibre; rinse filters with 250 mL distilled water before use.
  - Filtered water should be transferred to a clean, dry 250 mL bottle and not returned to the unfiltered bottle.
  - If volume >100 mL, transfer 20 mL to a vial for Al/Fe analysis and acidify with 20 µL HCl.
- Labeling: Use ECN Site Identification Code, Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code to uniquely identify each sample.
- Contact and supplier references included for equipment.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers must be washed with a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Cleaning options: Decomatic (if available) or overnight soaking in Decon-90.
- Rinse sequence: four washes in tap water, three in deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times in distilled water and keep for reuse with the same sampler.
- After washing, shake to remove drops, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, and recap immediately.
- Decon products available from multiple suppliers (as listed in Appendix I).
