# ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

- Aim and scope
  - Provide guidelines for analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
  - Laboratories are responsible for managing analytical resources under controlled conditions; must document methodology changes and validation procedures.
  - Annual review by Analytical Working Group with representatives from each laboratory.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - Laboratories must verify, quality assure, clean, and transform data.
  - Analyses should be documented and methodologies updated as changes occur.
  - Methods and performance characteristics should be recorded for traceability and future assessment.

- Approved and reference techniques
  - Determinand-specific approved techniques are provided; alternative techniques exist (with notes).
  - Reference techniques listed to compare and assess new methods; transparency about species quantified and ultimate detection limits.
  - Labs should report the fraction measured (e.g., SO4 2− as S) and monitor alternative methods for bias if used.

- Data management and methodology records
  - Details of analytical methods are kept at each laboratory; summary information is stored in the ECN database.
  - One data record per determinand per ECN site, linking to site, core measurement, determinand, and date to indicate methodology and precision.
  - When methodology changes, a new dated record is added to the database.

- Validation, accuracy, and precision
  - Validation through approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal quality control; participation in interlaboratory schemes (e.g., AQUACHECK).
  - Accuracy: closeness to true value; assessed via control samples and recorded correction procedures.
  - Precision: controlled via quality control samples and batch assessments; data should not be submitted if QC indicates unacceptable performance.

- Quality control procedures
  - ECN-specific QC system using synthetic QC samples; encourages independent QC validation and interlaboratory comparison.
  - Potential for calculating between-site correction factors if sites use the same QC solutions.
  - Monitoring for rogue batches and long-term trends; managed by analysts.
  - Two concentrated QC solutions (cation and anion) distributed annually; site managers prepare QC dilutions as needed.

- Data transfer and QC data format
  - QC data must be submitted to the ECN CCU in a machine-readable format, aligned with sample data fields.
  - Single QC data record per batch, covering both anion and cation results, including preparation dates, analysis completion, and determinations for pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions, DOC, Total N, etc.
  - Data fields include measurement code, site ID, QC sample code, preparation dates, analysis dates, pH, conductivity, and all determinands with units and precision; quality codes may be included if required.

- Priority determinands and sample handling when volumes are limited
  - Priority ranking to guide handling and analytical options during low rainfall:
    1. pH, conductivity
    2. Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ first; then K+, Na+)
    3. Anions (NO3−, SO4 2−, then PO4 3−, Cl−)
    4. NH4+–N
    5. DOC
    6. Total-N, alkalinity
    7. Cations requiring separate acidified portions (Fe2+, Al3+)
  - Refer to the Initial Water Handling Protocol for solution handling, filtration, pH, and acidification.

- Metadata, reporting, and traceability
  - Laboratories should provide methodology metadata to the ECN database; summary data for ECN is linked to site, determinand, date, and method.
  - Emphasizes uniformity of analytical ranges and detection limits, with guidance to reanalyze at lower ranges if needed for study purposes.

- Cross-references and additional notes
  - For pH and conductivity, see the Initial Water Handling Protocol.
  - The protocol supports long-term trend analysis by maintaining consistent QC and methodology records and enabling detection of analytical biases over time.
