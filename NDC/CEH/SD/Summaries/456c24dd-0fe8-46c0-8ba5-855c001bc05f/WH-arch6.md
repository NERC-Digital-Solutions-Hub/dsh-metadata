# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

- Aim
  - Measure conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water; filter samples prior to chemical analysis.

- Rationale
  - Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; slowing methods include filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe) acidification.
  - Some activities require laboratory training, experience, and health and safety compliance; guidance from chemists who perform analyses may be needed.

- Initial storage method
  - Store samples at 1–4°C if the interval to measurement of conductivity/pH exceeds 7 hours; return to cold storage if filtering isn’t completed the same day.
  - If samples are sent for initial handling, ship on collection day by fastest method.
  - Transit samples in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

- Conductivity measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C; use method in HMSO 1978.
  - Express results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm⁻¹).

- pH measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; the same subsample can be used for both conductivity and pH, but conductance measured first and the subsample must not be returned to the main sample.
  - Use HMSO 1988 method (separate glass and reference electrodes); express results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

- Filtering
  - Filter within 60 hours using Appendix I method; record filtering details with the unique sample codes.
  - After filtration, analyze for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻-P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; optional for precipitation water).
  - If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, use an ordered priority as documented.

- Storage prior to chemical analysis
  - Store at 1–4°C; ideally analyze within 16 days and definitely within 28 days of collection.
  - If sending to another location, minimize time out of cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

- Author references
  - WH Protocol authors and references (e.g., J.K. Adamson; HMSO publications 1978, 1988) underpin methodologies for conductivity, pH, and related procedures.

- Washing bottles (Appendix II)
  - Containers washed with laboratory cleaning agents prior to first use and approximately every six months or when heavily soiled; cleaning agents should be phosphate- and hypochlorite-free.
  - Use appropriate washing equipment (e.g., Decon/Decon-90); rinse steps include multiple tap and deionised water rinses; after use, containers are drained, dried in warm air, and recapped.

- Appendix I. Filtering (equipment and procedure)
  - Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil, 47 mm), membrane filters 0.45 µm (Whatman WCN), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
  - Contamination prevention: rinse all parts with deionised/distilled water; avoid touching filter surfaces; use forceps to handle filters; single-use per sample.
  - Pre-filtering for soils/rivers may be required and should be washed with 250 ml distilled water before use.
  - If >100 ml sample volume, take a 20 ml subsample for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
  - Sample labeling: ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code; the final data must include this unique reference.

- Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
  - Cleaning protocol ensures samples are not contaminated; use phosphate- and hypochlorite-free agents; rinse and dry steps detailed; containers recapped after cleaning.

- Procedure
  - Documentation and data capture accompany sample handling, filtering, and storage per the above standards.
  
- Suppliers
  - References to suppliers for protocol components (e.g., filter assemblies, membranes, bottles) are provided within the WH Protocol.
