# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water, and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate after collection due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Deterioration is slowed via: filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations only) acidification.
- Activities may require laboratory training and health and safety compliance; consult chemists performing analyses.

## Initial storage method
- Store in cold storage (1–4°C) if the interval between collection and measurement of conductivity and pH exceeds seven hours.
- If filtering is not completed on the same day, return to cold storage.
- If samples are sent to another site, dispatch on the collection day; in transit, keep in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C, using the HMSO (1978) method.
- Express results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm^-1).

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample; use separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Use the same subsample for both conductivity and pH, but measure conductivity first and do not return the subsample to the main sample.
- Express results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

## Filtering
- Filtering must occur within 60 hours of collection, following Appendix I method.
- Record filtering details with the unique sample codes described in the Protocols (Appendix I).
- After filtration, analyze for dissolved Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl−, NO3−-N, SO4 2−, PO4 3−, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (DOC not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, follow the priority order specified in the AG Protocol.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Storage temperature 1–4°C.
- Analysis should be completed preferably within 16 days of collection but definitely within 28 days.
- If samples are sent to another location, minimize time out of cold storage (base guidance: next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

## Author references
- Protocols reference J.K. Adamson (HMSO) and related documents for methods and quality control.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membrane filters 0.45 µm, glass fibre filters GF/C, vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
- Handling: rinse all contact surfaces with deionised/distilled water; avoid touching filter surfaces; use forceps; one filter per sample.
- Pre-filtering: soils (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtering with glass fibre filters, washed with 250 mL distilled water.
- Subsampling for metals: if sample >100 mL, transfer 20 mL to a vial for determination of Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µL HCl.
- Labeling: use ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code to uniquely identify each sample; ensure this reference appears with final data in the ECN database.
- Suppliers: BDH, Millipore (UK) Ltd, etc.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers must be washed with a lab cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Use Decon (or Decon-90) if available; other cleaning options acceptable.
- Rinse sequences: four taps with tap water and three with deionised/distilled water after washing; after use, rinse three times with distilled water and re-cap.
- Drying and storage: shake off water, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, and re-cap immediately.
- Cleaning products available from listed suppliers.
