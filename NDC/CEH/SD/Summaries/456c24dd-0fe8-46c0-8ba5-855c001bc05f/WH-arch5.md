# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale (data governance perspective)
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; use filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe) acidification to slow deterioration.
- Some procedures require lab training, specialised equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background and quality control procedures are documented in referenced materials.

## Data Lifecycle and Timing
- Initial storage
  - Store in cold storage (1–4°C) if interval between collection and measurement >7 hours.
  - Return to cold storage if filtration not completed on the same day.
  - If sent to another site, ship the same day; in transit use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.
- Conductivity measurement
  - Within 36 hours of collection, on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C; report to one decimal (0.1 µS cm^-1).
- pH measurement
  - Within 36 hours of collection, on an unfiltered subsample; same subsample as conductivity (conductivity first); results to 0.01 pH unit; separate electrodes for measurement.
- Filtering
  - Within 60 hours of collection; follow Appendix I method; record filtering details using unique sample codes; after filtration, analyze for listed determinands (see below); DOC not mandatory for precipitation water.
  - If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, use the priority order documented in the chemical analysis protocol (AG Protocol).
- Storage prior to chemical analysis
  - Store at 1–4°C; analysis ideally within 16 days, but definitely within 28 days.
  - If samples are sent to another location for analysis, minimize out-of-cold-storage by ensuring next-day delivery and avoiding Friday dispatch.

## Data Items and Metadata
- Determinands (to be analyzed after filtration)
  - Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).
- Metadata and unique identifiers
  - Each sample must be labeled with a unique reference:
    - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
    - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date
    - Additional sampler code as needed
  - The final data should be submitted to the ECN database with this unique reference.

## Data Quality and Provenance
- Filtering details must be recorded; use Appendix I procedures.
- Unique sample codes enable traceability from collection to data entry.
- Documentation of work performed on datasets and any deviations or priorities for analyses (per APPENDIX I and AG Protocol).

## Data Storage and Handling
- Maintain cold storage (1–4°C) from collection through analysis windows.
- Minimise time out of cold storage, especially when samples are shipped to external labs.
- Document all handling steps to preserve provenance and auditability.

## Appendices and Documentation (Key Procedures)
- Appendix I. Filtering
  - Equipment: filter funnel assemblies, membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters, vacuum pump (≈0.5 bar).
  - Handling: rinse all parts with deionised/distilled water; filters must not be touched by hand; use forceps; single-use per sample.
  - Pre-/post-filtration steps: pre-filtering may be required for SS and rivers; wash pre-filters with 250 ml distilled water before use.
  - Subsampling for Al/Fe: for volumes >100 ml, take 20 ml subsample and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
  - Labeling: include ECN Site ID, Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, sampler code; ensure final data includes the unique reference.
- Appendix II. Bottle and Vial Washing
  - Cleaning: use lab cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite; decontaminate with Decon products as appropriate; rinse steps detailed (tap water and deionised water); dry and cap containers.
  - Reuse: containers cleaned and recapped for subsequent samplings.
  - Suppliers and cleaning agents are provided for procurement.

## Roles, Safety, and Compliance
- Training and guidance from chemists may be required; adherence to health and safety requirements when handling acids and concentrated reagents.
- Documentation and standardization across sites to support reliable cross-site data sharing and database integration.
