# WAG Protocol

- Aim
  - Provide guidelines for analyzing water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
  - Labs manage analytical resources while participating labs must conduct analyses under controlled conditions and document methodology, changes, and validation procedures.
  - Analytical Working Group meets annually to review procedures and methods; define detection limits as targets.

- Scope and Responsibilities
  - Laboratories report methodology details to the ECN database; maintain records for each determinand, site, and date.
  - Each determinand has approved and reference techniques; laboratories must justify method choices and ensure comparability.

- Approved Techniques and Determinands
  - Determinands include pH, conductivity, major cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al), anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, Cl-), NH4-N, alkalinity, DOC, Total N.
  - Tables specify alternative techniques for each determinand; some methods quantify related species and may require comparative tests.
  - Detection limits are provided as targets for laboratories; results should be expressed with appropriate units and fractions (e.g., NO3-, NO3-N, etc.).

- Reference Techniques
  - Long-term references for comparison and assessment of new methodologies.
  - For each determinand, specifies preferred reference technique and reporting format, including ultimate detection limits and measurement basis.

- Priority Listing of Determinands
  - Sample volumes can be limited; priority (1 = highest) provides guidance:
    - 1: pH and conductivity
    - 2: Anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, Cl-)
    - 3: Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, then K+, Na+)
    - 4: NH4+-N
    - 5: DOC
    - 6: Fe2+, Al3+
    - 7: Total-N, alkalinity
  - Refer to Initial Water Handling Protocol for sample handling and preparation guidance.

- Providing Details of Methodology
  - Laboratories keep full methodological records; a summary with site, core measurement, date, methodology, and precision is stored in the ECN meta database.
  - Includes an example entry (e.g., nitrate via ion chromatography) to illustrate data linkage and reporting.

- Validation: Accuracy and Precision
  - Validation achieved through approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and interlaboratory checks (e.g., AQUACHECK).
  - Accuracy: assessed by inter-laboratory agreement; demands logging accuracy results and any corrective actions; data to be shared for conformity checks.
  - Precision: controlled via synthetic QC solutions; QC data reported with results; data rejected if QC indicates unacceptable performance.
  - Example records illustrate tracking of accuracy (e.g., percentage relative error) and corrective measures.

- Quality Control Procedures for the ECN Terrestrial Network
  - A separate QC system exists for ECN participants; labs encouraged to continue independent QC and join interlaboratory schemes.
  - Potential for calculating between-site correction factors; helps detect rogue batches and long-term trends.
  - QC procedures include preparation and analysis of dedicated QC solutions (two concentrates for cations and anions), annual reconstitution, and continuity checks.
  - QC data must be submitted to the ECN Central Coordination Unit (CCU) in a prescribed format, with a single QC record per batch covering both anion and cation data.

- Data Transfer and Records
  - Data and QC records transferred to ECN in machine-readable form; standardized fields include preparation dates, analysis dates, results for each determinand, and quality codes.
  - Example QC record format provided (Moor House) with a sequence of fields from measurement code to quality codes.

- Governance and Practical Implications
  - Establishes standardized analytical methods and validation across the ECN network to support reliable environmental monitoring decisions.
  - Enables transparent documentation of methodologies, detection limits, and data quality, facilitating governance, trend analysis, and policy evaluation.
  - Emphasizes data sharing of methodology and QC results to ensure data integrity and comparability across sites and over time.
