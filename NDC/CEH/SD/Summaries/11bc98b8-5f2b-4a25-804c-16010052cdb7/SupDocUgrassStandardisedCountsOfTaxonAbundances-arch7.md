# U-GRASS (Understanding and enhancing soil ecosystem services and resilience in UK grass and croplands) UK grasslands:   Standardised   counts   of   bacteria,   fungi   and   micro eukaryotes   abundances   across   geo   linked   sampling   locations   on grassland, UK (2016)

## Executive summary
- Dataset of standardised counts of taxon abundances (bacteria, fungi, microeukaryotes) from soil samples collected at paired intensive and extensive UK grassland systems, including low and high pH soils, across 32 sites.
- Samples collected in winter/spring 2015–2016; DNA extracted and taxonomic marker genes sequenced to quantify microbial diversity and abundance.
- Part of NERC U-GRASS Soil Security Programme; aims to understand soil functional change under different management and climate scenarios.
- Lineage: field sampling, DNA extraction, amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics at CEH; data exported as CSV for deposition into the EIDC.

## Sampling and study scope
- 32 UK sites with land-use contrasts (low vs. high intensity).
- Soil cores (15×5 cm) collected along 100 m interfaces at 25 m intervals (5 paired replicates per site).
- Sampling period: November 2015–February 2016; samples stored at -20°C prior to processing.

## Laboratory methods and diversity metrics
- DNA extraction from 0.25 g soil using MoBio PowerSoil kit; quantified with Qubit and Nanodrop.
- Amplicon sequencing targets and platforms:
  - 16S rRNA (bacteria), 18S rRNA (microeukaryotes), ITS (fungi).
  - Illumina MiSeq with V3 chemistry, 600 cycles.
- Bioinformatics:
  - OTU clustering at 97% similarity; taxonomic assignment using GreenGenes (16S) and UNITE (ITS/18S).
  - Diversity analyses in R (vegan): rarefaction, Shannon index, species richness, evenness.
- Outputs provide both raw OTU tables and summary diversity metrics.

## Data structure and files
- Seven flat CSV files:
  - UgrassStandardisedCountsOfTaxonAbundances.csv: 450 rows, 23 columns; geospatial coordinates (latitude/longitude), sample IDs (16S/18S/ITS), DNA concentrations, diversity metrics (Shannon, richness, evenness) and richness at multiple abundance thresholds.
  - 16sTaxonomy.csv, 18sTaxonomy.csv, ItsTaxonomy.csv: OTU taxonomic assignments (eight taxonomic ranks) with bootstrap >= 0.8; 33,975 / 24,110 / 35,750 rows respectively.
  - 16sAmpliconData.csv, 18sAmpliconData.csv, ItsAmpliconData.csv: OTU frequency tables by sample; ~34k / 24k / 35k rows with 425/430/426 sample columns; cross-referenced via OTU numbers.
- Cross-references:
  - Sample_ID columns link amplicon data to the UgrassStandardisedCountsOfTaxonAbundances.csv metadata.
  - Taxonomy tables link to OTU data via OTU_number.

## Data provenance and access
- Data generated by CEH Wallingford and Rothamsted Research units; deposited for broader use (EIDC).
- Authors: Griffiths RI, Puissant J, Goodall TI; affiliated with Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (Bangor and Wallingford).

## GIS-relevant considerations and uses
- Geospatial framing: 32 geo-referenced sampling sites with precise latitude/longitude, enabling landscape-scale spatial analyses of soil microbial communities.
- Can be integrated with environmental layers (soil pH, management intensity, climate, soil type) to map microbial diversity and taxon distributions across the UK.
- Data allow linking microbial composition and diversity metrics to land-use contrasts and soil conditions for policy and resource management applications.
- Data resolution is site-level with multi-sample replication along interfaces; suitable for regional or landscape-scale GIS analyses and visualization.

## Context and implications
- Highlights the importance of soil biodiversity for ecosystem services and resilience under varying management and climate scenarios.
- Uses modern molecular approaches to profile soil microbial communities and their potential functional implications, enabling more informed soil management decisions.
