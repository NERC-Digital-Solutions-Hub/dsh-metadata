# Supporting information for Traits data from trees exposed to a 50% reducing in canopy throughfall for 14 years in Caxiuanã, Brazil, September to October 2016

- Overview
  - Data from the Caxiuanã through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in eastern Amazonia (1°43' S, 51°27' W).
  - Two 1-hectare plots: a through-fall exclusion plot (TFE) excluding 50% of canopy throughfall since 2002, and a control plot without drought structure.
  - Sampling in Sept–Oct 2016 (peak dry season) across 176 trees (86 control, 90 TFE) spanning 14 genera and 31 species.
  - 17 traits measured per tree or branch, with mean plot-scale values summarized in Table 1.
  - Growth and light environment data collected: dendrometer-based growth rates and a 1–5 light score per tree.

- Experimental site and design
  - Location: eastern Amazonia; TFE plot with plastic canopy exclusion structure.
  - Plot setup: 1 ha control plot; 1 ha drought (TFE) plot.
  - Sampling aims: capture variation across size classes and canopy light conditions.

- Tree and trait sampling
  - Sampled 176 trees (86 control, 90 TFE) across multiple size classes and canopy conditions.
  - 14 genera and 31 species represented.
  - Each day, 3 branches per tree were collected for trait measurements with branches selected by light environment (sunlit upper canopy or top-of-canopy for smaller/shaded trees).

  - LA:SA (leaf area to sapwood area ratio)

- Leaf trait data collection and processing
  - A–Ci curves: ~1 m branch used; Li-Cor 6400 system; CO2 series (400, 200, 75, 400, 800, 1200, 2000 ppm) with PAR ~1500 μmol m-2 s-1 and ~28°C chamber temperature.
  - Vcmax and Jmax derived via fits to Sharkey et al. (2007) models; temperature-corrected to 25°C (using R 3.4.2) with curve abort if gs < 0.03 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1.
  - R leaf: measured on adjacent leaf in dark with 400 ppm CO2, 0 PAR, ~28°C; corrected to 25°C.
  - LMA: leaves scanned, dried at 70°C; area measured with ImageJ; LMA calculated from leaf area and dry mass.
  - N leaf (Kjeldahl) and P leaf (spectrophotometry, ammonium metavanadate).
  - LA:SA: leaf area from scanning; sapwood area from stem analysis; ratio computed.
  - Data handling and corrections referenced to Rowland et al. (2015a, 2015b, 2018, 2020) and related methodological papers.

- Stem CO2 efflux measurements
  - Instrument: gas analyser (EGM4/EGM5) in a closed-loop system connected to a 75 cm2 stem area via a 213 cm3 acrylic chamber.
  - Measurement window: 120–220 seconds; slope of CO2 increase used to calculate R stem.
  - Quality control: chamber leaks checked by exposing edges to high CO2 concentrations; only linear slopes with r > 0.98 retained; data temperature-corrected to 25°C (Q10 = 2.0).
  - Time of day: measurements between 08:00 and 17:00.

- Plant hydraulic traits
  - Ψpd and Ψmd: measured with a PMS pressure chamber on leaves excised as above and below sampling windows (04:30–06:30 for Ψpd; 13:00–14:30 for Ψmd).
  - P50: derived from hydraulic vulnerability curves following rehydration; pneumatic method with progressive drying and measurement of percent air discharge and leaf Ψ.
  - Ks max and PLC: measured from sections ≥2 m long to avoid open-vessel artefact; decalcified to measure initial lumen conductance (Ks) and then emboli removed to measure Ks max; PLC calculated as percentage difference between Ks and Ks max.
  - Wood density (P): determined from ~1 cm branch sample; bark removed; density calculated from dry mass and water-displaced volume.
  - Laboratory procedures followed established references (e.g., Pereira & Mazzafera; Tyree; Sperry; Torres-Ruiz et al.; Tsuda & Tyree).

- Growth and light environment
  - Growth rates: mean stem increment calculated from quarterly dendrometer readings 2010–2016; annual mean growth rate derived and log-transformed.
  - Light environment: tree light score assigned from 1 (fully shaded) to 5 (entirely sunlit canopy).

- Data quality, limitations, and references
  - Methodological notes include open-vessel artefact considerations and sampling strategies to mitigate artefacts.
  - Multiple references provided for methods and prior findings (e.g., Domingues et al., Pereira et al., Rowland et al., Sharkey et al., Schneider et al., Sperry et al., Tyree, Tsuda & Tyree, Torress-Ruiz et al., etc.).
  - Full methodological details, calibration steps, and data processing workflows are described to support replication and data reuse.
