# Supporting information for Traits data from trees exposed to a 50% reducing in canopy throughfall for 14 years in Caxiuanã, Brazil, September to October 2016

- Experimental site and design
  - Caxiuanã through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in eastern Amazonia.
  - Two 1-hectare plots: a TFE plot that excludes 50% of canopy throughfall since 2002, and a corresponding 1-hectare control plot without drought structure.

- Tree sampling and scope
  - Sampling conducted in September–October 2016 (peak dry season).
  - 176 trees sampled across 14 genera and 31 species; 86 on the control, 90 on the TFE.
  - Attempted distribution across size classes (DBH) and canopy light conditions.

- Traits measured (17 traits; table lists plot, species, DBH, light score, and trait values)
  - Leaf-level: Vcmax (max carboxylation), Jmax (max electron transport), Rleaf (leaf dark respiration), Min gs, Max gs, LMA (leaf mass per area), Nleaf, Pleaf.
  - Stomatal/ CO2 exchange: Rstem (stem CO2 efflux).
  - Hydraulic/water relations: Ψpd (pre-dawn water potential), Ψmd (midday water potential), P50 (xylem pressure for 50% loss of conductance), Ksmax (max lumen conductance), PLC (percent loss of conductivity), SMp50 (hydraulic safety margin from Ψmd and P50), LA:SA (leaf area to sapwood area).
  - Wood traits: r (branch wood density).
  - DBH, Tree Light Score (1–5) to capture light environment.
  - All measured at plot-scale mean values (Table 1 in the document references trait acronyms, descriptions, and units).

- Sampling and measurements per tree
  - Three branches collected from each tree on successive days.
  - Branch 1 (0430–0630): Ψpd measured, rehydrated, then used to build hydraulic vulnerability curve to derive P50 via pneumatic method.
  - Branch 2 (1000–1200): Leaves used for A–Ci curves to derive Vcmax and Jmax; Rleaf, Min gs, Max gs measured on the same branch; leaves dried for Pleaf, Nleaf, and LMA analyses.
  - Branch 3 (1300–1400): Leaves used to measure Ψmd; branch used to measure Ksmax and PLC; LA:SA calculated from scanned leaves using ImageJ.

- Leaf gas exchange and related traits
  - A–Ci curves with Li-COR 6400 to derive Vcmax and Jmax; PAR held at 1500 µmol m−2 s−1; chamber temperature ~28°C.
  - Vcmax and Jmax temperature-corrected to 25°C using Sharkey et al. (2007) equations.
  - Rleaf measured in dark (0 PAR) at ~28°C and corrected to 25°C.
  - LMA determined from scanned leaves and drying; Nleaf via Kjeldahl; Pleaf via spectrophotometry (Malavolta et al. 1997).

- Stem CO2 efflux
  - 75 cm2 stem area measured with a clear acrylic chamber (213 cm3) connected to a CO2 gas analyser in a closed loop.
  - Slope of CO2 concentration over 120–220 seconds used to derive Rstem; measurements conducted 8:00–17:00; data temperature-corrected to 25°C (Q10 = 2.0).

- Hydraulic traits and safety metrics
  - Ψpd and Ψmd measured with a plant pressure chamber; Ψpd from 3–4 leaves per branch (04:30–06:30), Ψmd from 3–4 leaves per branch (13:00–14:30).
  - P50 derived from hydraulic vulnerability curves using the pneumatic method with sequential drying and leaf Ψ readings.
  - Ksmax and PLC derived from excised stem segments using high-pressure flow methods; emboli removed to measure Ks under opened-vessel conditions; PLC calculated as percent difference between Ks and Ksmax.
  - Sample handling ensures avoidance of open-vessel artefacts; central branch segments (>2× maximum vessel length) used for measurements.

- Wood density
  - P (wood density) determined from ~1 cm diameter branch samples; bark removed, samples dried to constant mass, volume measured by water displacement.

- Growth and light environment
  - Growth rates computed from mean stem increment data from dendrometers (2010–2016), averaged monthly growth, log-transformed.
  - Light score (1–5) assigned per tree to indicate canopy light conditions (1 = fully shaded, 5 = emergent/canopy gaps).

- Data quality, provenance, and references
  - Methods align with established protocols and cited studies (e.g., Rowland et al., 2015–2018; Pereira et al.; Sharkey et al. 2007; Tsuda & Tyree; Sperry et al.; ImageJ for leaf area; Kjeldahl and spectrophotometry for nutrients).
  - Detailed methodological notes and related data can be found in Rowland et al. (2018) and associated references in the SI.

- Practical use and context for analysts
  - The dataset provides multiscale trait measurements under a well-defined drought treatment, enabling analyses of trade-offs between hydraulic function, photosynthetic capacity, growth, and wood properties under reduced throughfall.
  - Enables investigations into how drought manipulation affects P50, Ks, PLC, ψ parameters, and their links to growth and leaf traits across tropical species in a controlled field setting.
  - Data structure supports cross-plot (TFE vs control) and cross-species comparative analyses, with emphasis on replication across genera and species, and integration with existing growth and physiological datasets.
