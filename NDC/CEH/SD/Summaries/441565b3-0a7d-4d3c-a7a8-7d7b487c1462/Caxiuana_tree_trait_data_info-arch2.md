# Supporting information for Traits data from trees exposed to a 50% reducing in canopy throughfall for 14 years in Caxiuanã, Brazil, September to October 2016

## Experimental site
- Caxiuanã through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in eastern Amazonia (1°43' S, 51°27' W).
- Two 1-hectare plots: a through-fall exclusion plot (TFE) excluding 50% canopy throughfall since 2002, and a matched control plot without drought structure.

## Tree and trait sampling
- Sampling conducted in September–October 2016 (peak dry season).
- 176 trees sampled: 86 on the control plot, 90 on the TFE plot.
- Sampling aimed to cover different size classes (10 cm DBH and up) and canopy light conditions; 14 genera and 31 species represented.
- Three branches per tree sampled per day to measure 17 traits (Table 1 lists trait descriptions and units).

## Traits measured (overview)
- Plot assignment (Control or Drought plot) and species identity.
- Tree size metric: DBH (cm).
- Light exposure: Tree Light Score (1–5).
- Leaf-level physiology and chemistry: Vcmax, Jmax, Rleaf, Min gs, Max gs, LMA, Nleaf, Pleaf.
- Whole-leaf and stem gas exchange: Rstem (stem CO2 efflux).
- Hydraulic traits: Ψpd (pre-dawn), Ψmd (midday), P50 (xylem pressure for 50% loss of conductance), Ksmax (max lumen conductance), PLC (percentage loss of conductivity), SMp50 (hydraulic safety margin), LA:SA (leaf area to sapwood area).
- Structural trait: r (branch wood density).

## Trait sampling and measurement timing
- Branch 1 (for Ψpd): collected 04:30–06:30, fully sunlit at upper canopy or top-of-canopy if smaller.
- Branch 2 (for A–Ci curves): collected 10:00–12:00; leaves used for Vcmax, Jmax, Rleaf, Min gs, Max gs; leaves dried for Pleaf, Nleaf, LMA.
- Branch 3 (for Ψmd, PLC, Ks): collected 13:00–14:00; leaves used for Ψmd measurements; branches processed for hydraulic measurements (P50, Ks, Ksmax) and LA:SA via leaf area using ImageJ.

## Leaf physiological measurements (Vcmax, Jmax, etc.)
- A–Ci curves obtained with Li-Cor 6400 photosynthesis system; PAR ~1500 µmol m−2 s−1; leaf/ chamber temperature ~28°C.
- CO2 setpoints: 400, 200, 75, 400, 800, 1200, 2000 ppm; minimum 60–180 seconds per change for stabilization.
- Vcmax and Jmax derived by fitting A–Ci data to Sharkey et al. (2007) models; values temperature-corrected to 25°C.
- Rleaf measured at 400 ppm, 0 PAR, ~28°C, then corrected to 25°C.
- Gs metrics: Max gs (peak during A–Ci), Min gs (stomata closed during Rleaf).
- LMA derived from leaf area scans and dry mass; Nleaf by Kjeldahl; Pleaf by spectrophotometry (ammonium metavanadate).

## Growth rates
- Growth rates computed for each tree using mean stem increment from dendrometers (measured quarterly 2010–2016).
- Mean growth increment calculated by averaging three monthly rates, then log-transformed.

## Stem CO2 efflux (Rstem)
- 75 cm2 area enclosed by a clear acrylic chamber (213 cm3 volume) sealed on the stem for 220 seconds.
- Closed-loop gas analyzer (EGM4/EGM5) recorded CO2 rise; slope used to calculate Rstem.
- Chamber had mixing aeration; tests for leaks; data quality checked (R^2 threshold > 0.98).
- Temperature-corrected to 25°C using Q10 = 2.0 and measured wood temperature.

## Plant hydraulic traits (Ψpd, Ψmd, ksmax, PLC, P50)
- Ψpd and Ψmd measured with a plant pressure chamber (N2-fed).
- P50 derived from hydraulic vulnerability curves produced from branches rehydrated after field sampling; pneumatic method used to incrementally dry samples and measure % air discharge vs leaf Ψ.
- Ks and Ksmax measured on two central branch sections under high-pressure flow to determine initial lumen conductance and embolism-free conductance.
- PLC calculated from the difference between Ks and Ksmax.
- To minimize open-vessel artefacts, wood segments were chosen >2× maximum vessel length; longer segments provide more accurate hydraulic estimates.

## Wood density (P)
- Wood density determined from ~1 cm branch samples: bark removed, samples dried to constant mass, volume measured via water displacement, density computed as dry mass/volume.

## Data processing and references
- Methods reference multiple foundational studies on plant hydraulics, photosynthesis, and measurement techniques (e.g., Pereira et al., 2016; Rowland et al., 2018; Sharkey et al., 2007).
- Observations and methods align with prior work on drought response and hydraulic traits in tropical trees (e.g., Rowland et al. 2015a,b; 2018; 2020).

## Data usage context
- The dataset provides a comprehensive, standardized set of leaf, stem, and hydraulic traits across two contrasting drought-exclusion plots, enabling analyses of drought influence on physiological performance and growth in tropical forest trees.
- Suitable for combining with other environmental monitoring datasets to enhance understanding of plant hydraulics, photosynthesis, and growth responses under reduced throughfall.
