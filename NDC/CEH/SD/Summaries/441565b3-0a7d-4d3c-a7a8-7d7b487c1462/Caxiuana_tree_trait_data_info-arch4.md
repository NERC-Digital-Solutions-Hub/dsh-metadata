# Supporting information for Traits data from trees exposed to a 50% reducing in canopy throughfall for 14 years in Caxiuanã, Brazil, September to October 2016

## Overview
- Data from the Caxiuanã through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in eastern Amazonia, comparing 1 ha drought plot (50% canopy throughfall exclusion since 2002) with a control plot.
- Sampling: September–October 2016 (peak dry season) of 176 trees across two plots (86 control, 90 TFE), representing 14 genera and 31 species.
- 14 traits measured (table of traits and units provided). Traits cover leaf-level physiology, hydraulic performance, and growth-related metrics.
- Branches were sampled daily from each tree, with specific branches allocated for pre-dawn leaf water potential, hydraulic vulnerability (P50), photosynthesis curves (A–Ci) and related leaf gas exchange measurements, and stem hydraulics.

## Experimental design and sampling details
- Plots: 1 ha control vs 1 ha drought (TFE) plot with 50% throughfall exclusion.
- Tree selection: distributed across DBH classes (10 cm DBH and up) and varied canopy light conditions; 3 branches per tree sampled per day.
- Sampling windows for branch collection:
  - Branch 1 (Ψpd): 04:30–06:30, fully sunlit or top-of-canopy leaves; rehydrated for 24 h for hydraulic measurements (P50) after sealing.
  - Branch 2 (A–Ci): 10:00–12:00, leaves used for Vcmax, Jmax, Rleaf, Min gs, Max gs; leaves dried for Pleaf, Nleaf, LMA.
  - Branch 3 (Ψmd, Ksmax, PLC, r, LA:SA): 13:00–14:00 for Ψmd; samples used to measure Ksmax, PLC; leaves for leaf-area to sapwood-area ratio (LA:SA) quantified via ImageJ.

## Traits measured (14 total)
- Plot/Tree status: Control or Drought plot; species identity; DBH; Tree Light Score.
- Gas exchange and photosynthesis: Vcmax (μmol CO2 m−2 s−1), Jmax (μmol CO2 m−2 s−1), Rleaf (μmol CO2 m−2 s−1), Min gs, Max gs.
- Stem and leaf respiration: Rstem (μmol CO2 m−2 s−1).
- Leaf structure and nutrients: LMA (g m−2), Nleaf (g g−1), Pleaf (g g−1).
- Hydraulic and xylem metrics: r (wood density; g cm−3), Ψpd (MPa), Ψmd (MPa), P50 (MPa), Ksmax (mol H2O m−1 MPa−1 s−1 m−2), PLC (%), SMp50 (MPa).
- Morphology: LA:SA (leaf area to sapwood area ratio).

## Measurement methods and data processing
- Photosynthesis and leaf gas exchange:
  - A–Ci curves measured with Li-COR 6400 under PAR ~1500 μmol m−2 s−1 and ≈28°C.
  - Vcmax and Jmax derived from A–Ci fits using Sharkey et al. (2007) models; curves corrected to 25°C.
  - Rleaf measured in dark conditions (CO2 400 ppm, 0 PAR) and corrected to 25°C.
  - Maximum and minimum stomatal conductance derived from A–Ci curve and dark measurements, respectively.
  - Leaf scans used to compute LMA; Nleaf by Kjeldahl; Pleaf by spectrophotometry.
- Hydraulic traits:
  - Ψpd (pre-dawn) and Ψmd (midday) measured with a plant pressure chamber on leaves from ~1 m branch samples.
  - P50 determined via pneumatic method from hydrated branches; vulnerability curves generated by progressively drying samples and recording air discharge and leaf Ψ.
  - Ks and Ks max measured on ≥2 m branch segments to minimize open-vessel artefacts; PLC calculated as the percentage difference between Ks and Ks max.
  - r (wood density) derived from dry mass and volume measurements of a ~1 cm branch segment after bark removal.
- Stem CO2 efflux (Rstem):
  - Measured using a 75 cm2 surface area chamber connected to a gas analyser in a closed-loop system; 120–220 s measurement window.
  - Data quality ensured by rejecting linear slopes with r > 0.98 and temperature-correcting to 25°C (Q10 = 2.0).
- Data quality and processing notes:
  - Quality control included discarding poor-quality hydraulic curves and slopes; all measurements conducted 8:00–17:00.
  - Metadata and methods referenced to Rowland et al. (2018, 2020) and supporting information sources for trait methodologies.

## Data provenance and references
- Primary methodological references include:
  - Pneumatic method for P50 (Pereira et al. 2016)
  - Photosynthesis and CO2 curve fitting (Sharkey et al. 2007)
  - Open-vessel artefact considerations (Pereira et al. 2016; Torres-Ruiz et al. 2017)
  - R-based data analysis and image processing (R 3.4.2; ImageJ)
  - Supporting methodological references for embolism, hydraulic conductance, and related measurements (multiple sources listed in the document).

## Data usage context
- Data provide a multi-trait view of tree physiology and hydraulics under long-term reduced throughfall, enabling analyses of growth response, hydraulic safety margins, and photosynthetic capacity under drought stress.
- The dataset supports comparative analyses across plots (Control vs Drought) and across genera/species, with standardized measurement protocols and explicit unit definitions.

## Notable metadata and related works
- The traits and methods align with previously published related work by Rowland and collaborators (e.g., Rowland et al., 2015a; 2015b; 2018; 2020) on drought responses, hydraulic traits, and growth changes in tropical forest trees.
- Table 1 in the document lists all measured traits with descriptions and units, facilitating data discoverability and reuse.
