# WD Protocol

## Aim
- Continuous recording of river discharge at ECN sites where the entire catchment lies within the ECN site.
- Monitor hydrological response to environmental change as an indicator of ecosystem and climate-related impacts.

## Rationale
- Water balance at a site is governed by climate, vegetation cover, and soil properties; changes in external climate or soil-vegetation structure affect evaporation, soil moisture, and runoff.
- Snowplay can be a particularly important factor; hydrological monitoring provides sensitive signals of environmental change.

## Equipment
- Permanently installed weir or venturi flume (BS 3680, Part 4A) to measure water stage.
- Campbell Scientific digital CR10 data logger; analogue Ott chart recorder as a supplement.
- Dip-flash device for manual stage readings.
- Data handling includes chart storage and procedure to ensure data integrity.

## Location
- Full installation includes an approach channel, a measuring structure, and a downstream channel.
- Site selection considerations:
  - Adequate length and regular cross-section of the approach channel.
  - Regular velocity distribution across the cross-section.
  - Avoidance of steep channels where possible.
  - Upstream effects on water levels due to the structure.
  - Ground impermeability for foundation.
  - Flood banks to contain maximum discharge.
  - Stability of downstream channel.
- Full details are described in BS 3680, Part 4A.

## Operation
- Logger records stage every 10 seconds; data are averaged and stored in 5-minute periods.
- A 15-minute discharge value is computed from a rating curve and stored, alongside 15-minute stage values.
- Calibration (development of rating curve) conducted using current meters across flow ranges; repeated every two years or if approach conditions change.
- Dip-flash datum checked every two years.
- Data quality control performed by site staff per Appendix I.
- A duplicate copy of the logger program is recommended at the site.
- Ott charts stored for reference; the data processing setup supports re-calculation if rating changes.

## Procedure (Data handling)
- Fortnightly data download to a PC via a storage module.
- Step-by-step site visit tasks:
  1. Take dip-flash reading.
  2. Note time and stage on old/new Ott charts; replace charts as needed; synchronize clock and pen.
  3. Retrieve data from Campbell logger.
  4. Check battery voltage; troubleshoot power supply; use external battery if needed.
  5. Inspect weir approach/crest for debris, sediment, or ice; clear safely if possible.
- A duplicate logger program should be kept on-site; Ott charts retained.

## Appendix I. Quality control of surface water discharge data
- Checks include:
  - First and last data points align with data removal times.
  - Consistency between manual (dip-flash) and automatic stage readings at start/finish.
  - Comparison of 12:00 stage values on steady-flow days.
  - Documentation of missing data or ice-related interruptions.
  - Maintenance notes (e.g., dredging) for ECN database.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Four key identifiers for every sample/recording occasion:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time (including time element when sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Core measurement: surface water discharge (WD Protocol)
- Variables recorded automatically at 15-minute intervals:
  - Site Identification Code
  - Core Measurement Code
  - Location Code
  - Recording (Sampling) date
  - Recording (Sampling) time
  - Stage (average) in meters
  - Discharge (average) in cubic meters per second (cumecs)
- Precision: 1-minute recording resolution for time; 0.001 m stage and 0.001 m3 s-1 for discharge as appropriate.
- Data submission to ECNCCU follows Data Transfer documentation; restricted access Site Managers' extranet, with contact ecnccu@ceh.uk for access.
