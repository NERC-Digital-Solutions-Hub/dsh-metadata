# WD Protocol

## Aim
- Establishes a continuous recording protocol for surface water discharge at ECN sites where the entire catchment lies within the ECN site.
- Uses hydrological data as a sensitive indicator of environmental change due to climate, vegetation, soil properties, and snow effects.
- Enables detection of changes in water balance, evaporation, soil moisture, and runoff.

## Rationale
- Hydrological variables respond to environmental change; monitoring provides a sensitive measure of such changes.
- Snow-driven sites may reveal particularly important climate-change signals.
- Data collected support understanding site hydrology in the context of broader environmental monitoring.

## Equipment Method
- Weir or flume installation for stage measurement, designed per site conditions (BS 3680, BS 1965).
- Data logger: Campbell Scientific CR10; supplemented by an Ott chart recorder where available.
- Dip-flash device for manual stage readings.
- 15-minute discharge values derived from stage via a rating curve; 10-second stage readings averaged to 5-minute intervals.

## Location
- Full installation comprises approach channel, measuring structure, and downstream channel.
- Site selection considerations include:
  - Length and regularity of channel cross-section
  - Velocity distribution across the approach channel
  - Avoiding steep channels
  - Upstream flooding effects and ground impermeability
  - Flood banks sizing for maximum discharge
  - Downstream channel stability
- Full guidance in BS 3680, Part 4A.

## Operation
- Logger records stage every 10 seconds; data averaged to 5-minute periods.
- 15-minute discharge values calculated via rating relationship; stored for QC and recalculation if rating changes.
- Each site develops its own calibration protocol; calibration every two years or when approach conditions change.
- Dip-flash datum checked every two years.
- Site staff perform data quality control following Appendix I procedures.
- A duplicate copy of the logger program is recommended at the site; Ott charts stored for reference.

## Data Handling and Quality Control (Procedure Summary)
- Fortnightly data download to a PC via a storage module.
- Steps include dip-flash reading, time-stamping, chart updates, data extraction, battery/solar checks, debris removal, and ensuring cables can move freely.
- Data integrity checks include: consistency of first/last points, cross-checks between manual and automatic readings, validation on days of steady flow, missing data notes, and maintenance logs.
- Data are documented with a clear audit trail in the ECN database.

## Appendix I. Quality control of surface water discharge data
- Record checks to ensure data removal timing matches logger data.
- Compare manual and automatic stage readings at start/finish.
- Compare midday stage values on steady-flow days.
- Note missing data, ice/dredging events, and maintenance outcomes for ECN database.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Core variables to identify each observation:
  - Site Identification Code (unique ECN site code)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., WD Protocol)
  - Location Code (replicate sampling locations within a site)
  - Recording date/time (with time, as needed)
- Automatic measurements at 15-minute intervals:
  - Stage (average), Discharge (average) in m and m3 s-1 (cumecs)
  - Precision: 1-minute time stamps
- Data formats and dataset documentation are available via the ECNCCU site manager extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
