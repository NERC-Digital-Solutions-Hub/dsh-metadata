# WD Protocol

## Aim
- Continuously record river discharge at ECN sites where the full catchment lies within the ECN site.
- Monitor hydrological responses to environmental change, reflecting climate, vegetation, and soil influences on water balance.
- Use data as sensitive indicators of environmental change, including potential snow-related effects.

## Rationale
- Hydrological conditions at a site respond to external climate and internal soil/vegetation structure changes.
- Changes in evaporation, soil moisture, and runoff are expected with environmental change; snow can be a particularly important component.

## Equipment Method
- Use a permanently installed weir or flume designed per site conditions, in accordance with BS 3680 (Part 4A).
- Data recorded by a Campbell Scientific CR10 data logger; supplemented by an analogue Ott chart recorder where possible; a dip-flash device enables manual stage readings.
- Full installation includes an approach channel, a measuring structure, and a downstream channel; each component affects measurement accuracy.

## Location
- Site selection emphasizes: adequate length of regular cross-section, regular velocity distribution, avoidance of steep channels, upstream effects, ground impermeability, flood banks, and downstream stability.
- BS 3680, Part 4A provides full details.

## Operation
- Data are recorded at 10-second intervals for stage, averaged and stored over 5-minute periods; 15-minute discharge values are derived from the rating curve and stored for quality control and potential re-calculation if the rating changes.
- Calibration: develop a rating curve using current meters across flow ranges; calibrate every two years or if approach conditions change.
- Dip-flash datum checked every two years.
- Data quality control carried out by site staff following Appendix I procedures.
- Data download to a PC every fortnight via a storage module, including steps to read dip-flash, time-stamp alignment, data extraction from the Campbell logger, battery/solar checks, and debris clearance.
- A duplicate copy of the logger program should be kept at the site; Ott charts archived for reference.

## Appendix I. Quality control of surface water discharge data
- Verify first and last data points against removal times.
- Compare manual (dip-flash) and automatic stage readings at start/end.
- Compare 12:00 stage values on steady-flow days.
- Note missing data or times when the weir was frozen; record maintenance and changes for ECN database.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Core parameters required to identify each sample/recording: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
- Core measurement: surface water discharge (WD Protocol).
- Variables recorded automatically at 15-minute intervals: Stage (average) and Discharge (average), with units in cubic meters per second; data are logged with GMT 24-hour clock and precision of 1 minute. Coding conventions and dataset formats are defined in the ECN Data Transfer documentation (restricted access; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk).
- Data submission to ECNCCU references the accompanying Data Transfer documentation for specific ECN dataset formats.
