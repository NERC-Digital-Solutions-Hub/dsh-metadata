# Nant Esgair Garn catchment - 20 year derived statistics of rainfall, streamflow and acidity

## Overview
- 20-year record of monthly statistics for 1 April 1982 to 1 April 2013.
- Metrics cover rainfall, streamflow, and acidity (pH) at a stream gauging station and nearby water quality station.
- Observations for 2013 at 15-minute resolution used to develop dynamic models; models used to derive the 20-year monthly statistics.
- Purpose: to understand controls on long-term aquatic biodiversity dynamics observed in the stream.

## Site and dataset context
- Nant Esgair Garn experimental catchment (LI6) near Llyn Brianne reservoir, Powys, Wales, UK.
- Catchment contributions: 0.573 km² for streamflow; 0.690 km² for downstream pH monitoring.
- Geology: shales, mudstones, greywackes, grits; soils: Podzols and Histosols.
- Land cover historically moorland and improved pastureland.
- Data released with vetted IPR by NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Data sources and measurements
- Rainfall: observations from Nant Y Mean and other archived raingauges; gaps filled by correlations with nearby gauges.
- Temperature: derived from Felindre weather station; data from Met Office MIDAS (station code 1243).
- NAO index: monthly values sourced publicly (CRU data).
- Streamflow and pH: measured at two stations using a trapezoidal flume and a pH sensor with data loggers; monitoring performed by Lancaster University.
- Data resolution: 15-minute observations for 2013; monthly statistics derived from daily rainfall, streamflow, and pH.

## Data processing and modeling workflow
- Daily rainfall, streamflow, and pH relationships modeled using the RIVC algorithm (CAPTAIN Toolbox for Matlab).
- Step 1: identify optimal model structures/parameters using 1 January–31 March 2013 data.
- Step 2: validate with 1 April–31 December 2013 data.
- Step 3: apply identified models to simulate daily rainfall–streamflow and rainfall–pH for 1 April 1982–1 April 2013.
- Monthly statistics then derived from the simulated daily series.
- Tools: CAPTAIN Toolbox, Matlab (R2013), LSIM.
- Code for statistics is provided (Mean, Median, percentiles, moving averages, pulses, growth season, etc.).

## Variables and data structure
- Data is stored in a single .csv with 159 columns (Columns 2–5 intentionally blank) and 32 rows.
- Each row corresponds to statistics for the first day of each month from 1 April 1982 to 1 April 2013.
- Variables cover:
  - Rainfall: mean, 10th percentile, total, maximum, coefficient of variation, etc. (estimation periods 365 days prior to sampling; plus other periods such as 120 days prior for some metrics).
  - Temperature: mean, max/min, range, CV, growing season length, duration of high/low temperature periods, etc.
  - NAO index: estimation period December–March.
  - Flow: mean, flow percentiles (e.g., 10th, 95th), moving averages (10/20 day), totals, min/max, ranges, CV, high/low flow pulses and their durations, rate of rise/fall, etc. (with 120-day estimation windows for many metrics).
  - pH: mean, 10th/95th percentiles, moving-average min/max, min/max, range, CV, etc. (estimation window 120 days prior).
- The metadata section lists the exact column mappings and their estimation periods.

## Analytical methods and code
- Statistical calculations implemented in Matlab with custom functions:
  - Mean, Median, Percentiles (10th, 50th, 95th), Exceedence, Min/Max of moving averages (10/20 days), Sum, Peak, Range, Coefficient of Variation.
  - Growing season length (above 5°C threshold) and pulses (high/low) with percentile-based thresholds (75th for highs, 25th for lows).
  - Duration measures and rate of rise/fall for flow.
- All analyses rely on daily simulations generated by the RIVC/CAPTAIN models, then aggregated to monthly statistics.

## Quality control
- CR1000 logger data checked for erroneous values (e.g., due to short power failures).
- Suspect values replaced with NaN to maintain data integrity.

## Data availability and lineage
- Dataset consists of one CSV with full metadata and documented statistical variables.
- Supporting documentation provides site details and data lineage.
- Data and metadata vetted for IP rights by NERC EIDC.
