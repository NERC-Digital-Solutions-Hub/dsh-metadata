# Plot_locations_metadata.rtf

## Overview
- Metadata document for Plot_locations.csv, which holds the locations of sampling sites.
- Plot_locations.csv is linked to an experimental design along a hillslope with three transects and boreholes.
- Boreholes labeled 'new' do not differ from those labeled 'old'.

## Experimental design
- Three 75 m long transects, 20 m apart, across a hillslope perpendicular to the River Hiraethlyn.
- On each transect, four boreholes drilled to bedrock; some locations have a second borehole.
- Additional boreholes are labeled as 'new'.

## Collection methods and instrumentation
- Coordinates collected with a handheld Garmin GPS device.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Latitude and Longitude recorded in decimal degrees (converted from degrees minutes seconds).
- Also collected as six-figure Ordnance Survey National Grid references.

## Data structure (Plot_locations.csv)
- Name: Site identifier
- Latitude: Decimal degrees
- Longitude: Decimal degrees
- Date: Date of measurement
- Time: Time of measurement (GMT)

## Projections and display notes
- Longitude/Latitude use GCS_WGS_1984 (WKID: 4326; EPSG).
- Eastings/Northings use OSGB1936 British National Grid (WKID: 27700; EPSG).
- Users must ensure the correct projection is used and the base map is in the correct projection to display sample sites accurately.

## Additional notes
- An image (Courtesy Welsh Government) is referenced as illustrating correct locations.
