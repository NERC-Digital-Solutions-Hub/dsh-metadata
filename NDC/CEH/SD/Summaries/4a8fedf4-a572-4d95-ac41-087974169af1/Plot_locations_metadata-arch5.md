# Plot_locations_metadata.rtf

## Overview
- Metadata for Plot_locations.csv containing the locations of sampling sites and their coordinates in multiple reference systems.

## Experimental design / Sampling regime
- Three transects, each 75 m long, 20 m apart, across a hillslope perpendicular to the river Hiraethlyn.
- Along each transect, four boreholes drilled to bedrock; some locations have a second borehole labeled 'new' (not different from 'old').

## Collection methods and instrumentation
- Coordinates collected with a handheld Garmin GPS device.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Latitude and Longitude recorded in degrees, minutes, seconds and converted to decimal degrees.
- Also collected as six-figure Ordnance Survey National Grid references.
