# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A framework for the proper conduct of funded research across multiple UK bodies to ensure fitness for purpose and high standards of quality in both research processes (QP) and scientific outcomes (QS).
- Applies to research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, and to BBSRC/NERC-funded work in their institutes.
- Emphasises that contractors must adopt best scientific practice from the outset and that compliance should be driven from the top of funded organisations.

## Principles and Compliance

- Focus on two core quality dimensions:
  - Quality of the research process (QP): rigour, repeatability, auditable procedures.
  - Quality of the science (QS): aims, approaches, and generation of new knowledge.
- “Fitness for purpose” as the overarching principle; researchers must be competent and adequately trained.
- Contractors are responsible for acceptance of the Code in proposals and for ensuring subcontractors comply; annual acceptance required for certain funders (BBSRC/NERC).
- The Funding Bodies may require risk assessments and formal discussions on inappropriate or non-applicable clauses; results may become part of funding terms.

## Monitoring and Assurance

- Monitoring compliance is necessary to ensure policies and processes exist and are applied consistently.
- Organisations should have formal, auditable systems to assure research quality, ideally by an impartial third party against internationally recognised standards.
- The Funding Bodies may audit a contractor’s research system (e.g., via UKAS audits).

## Specific Requirements

1) Responsibilities
- Contractor organisation bears overall project quality responsibility.
- Managers and supervisors promote good scientific practice; the Project Leader (PI) is responsible for all project work, including subcontractors.
- All staff and subordinates have clearly defined responsibilities.

2) Competence
- All personnel must be competent to perform tasks; training must be supervised to protect quality.
- Documented evidence of capability and training records must be maintained.

3) Project Planning
- Conduct risk assessments; maintain a clear written project plan addressing design, statistics, and other factors.
- Plans must be agreed with the Funding Body; ethics and licences considered where relevant.
- Regular reviews of timetables and plans; major amendments pre-approved.

4) Quality Control
- Implement planned quality assurance processes; subject projects to fit-for-purpose reviews.
- Output authorisation as agreed with the Funding Body; notify and correct post-publication errors promptly.
- Continuous improvement through regular process reviews.

5) Health and Safety
- Full compliance with relevant health and safety regulations.

6) Handling of Samples and Materials
- Clear, durable labeling; retention periods defined; storage conditions monitored if critical.
- Traceability of samples through analysis; defined disposal routes.

7) Facilities and Equipment
- Safe, adequate working environment; regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
- Contingency plans for disruptions; SOPs for critical equipment.

8) Documentation of Procedures and Methods
- Document all procedures with audit trails and version controls; validation of methods for fitness for purpose.
- Link primary data to secondary processed information.

9) Research / Work Records
- High-quality, detailed records enabling replication.
- Project Leader ensures record validity; records stored securely with clear location and archiving procedures.

10) Field-based Research
- Compliance with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimise pollution risks.
- All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based work.

## Annex: Evidence and Documentation

- Examples of documentary evidence are provided to demonstrate compliance in each area, including:
  - Organizational structure and personnel responsibilities.
  - Competence records, training, and CVs.
  - Risk assessments, project plans, milestones, and approvals.
  - Internal audits, fit-for-purpose reviews, and publication authorization.
  - Health and safety plans and compliance documentation.
  - Sample handling records, storage logs, and tracking systems.
  - Equipment maintenance, calibration records, and SOPs.
  - Document and version control procedures; validated SOPs.
  - Archive and data integrity procedures for research records.
  - Field-based risk assessments.

## Background and Endorsement

- Originated from a collaboration among BBSRC, Defra, FSA, and NERC, with further endorsements from Northern Ireland, Scottish, and Welsh administrations, and other agencies (APHA, Fera, FC, MMO, Natural England, VMD).
- Launched May 2003; effect from June 1, 2004; subject to joint audit programmes (e.g., UKAS in 2006).
- Revised in light of audits and workshop outputs; applicable to funded research across the listed bodies and their institutes.
