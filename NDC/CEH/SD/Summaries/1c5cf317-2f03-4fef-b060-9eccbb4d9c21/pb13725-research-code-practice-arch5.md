# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Purpose and Scope
- A governance framework for quality in research funded by UK bodies (Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations) and in BBSRC/NERC institutes.
- Emphasizes fitness for purpose, quality of process (QP), and quality of science (QS).
- Applies to all types of research; designed to ensure research is rigorous, auditable, and shareable.
- Introduced May 2003; effect from 1 June 2004; subject to audits (UKAS) and periodic revisions.

## Background and Applicability
- Endorsed by multiple UK government bodies and agencies.
- Defra and FSA initiated an audit program starting in 2006 to verify Code compliance on projects post-1 June 2004.
- Aimed at ensuring contractors and subcontractors adhere to the Code’s provisions.

## Principles behind the Code
- QP: confidence in the processes used to gather and interpret results; repeatable and auditable.
- QS: aims and scientific validity of the project.
- Contractors must commit to high standards from the outset; competence and training are essential.
- Compliance should be driven from the top of funded organisations.

## Compliance and Monitoring
- Contractors indicate acceptance of the Code when applying for funding; discussions on inappropriate clauses may be documented.
- Projects may require formal risk assessments; records of discussions become part of funding terms.
- Annual acceptance required for BBSRC/NERC-funded work.
- Funding bodies may audit contractor systems; evidence of compliance may be requested.

## Responsibilities
- The contractor organization is responsible for overall research quality and policy compliance.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors promote good scientific practice and skill development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader is responsible for all work, including subcontractors; clear roles must be defined and communicated.

## Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; training must be supervised to protect quality.
- Contractors must provide documented evidence of capability and training.

## Project Planning
- Conduct risk assessments to identify key success factors and objective attainment.
- Develop a clear, written project plan (design, statistics, etc.) agreed with the Funding Body.
- Include ethical approvals and licences as applicable.
- Schedule regular plan reviews; major amendments require pre-approval.

## Quality Control
- Implement planned processes to assure research quality; conduct fit-for-purpose reviews.
- Outputs authorized as agreed with the Funding Body; notify and act on post-publication errors.
- Embrace continual improvement through regular process reviews.

## Health and Safety
- Full compliance with relevant health and safety regulations.

## Handling of Samples and Materials
- Clear, durable labeling; designated retention periods; traceability through analysis and use.
- Storage conditions monitored as needed; defined disposal routes and dates.

## Facilities and Equipment
- Safe working environment; regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
- Contingency plans for disruptions; standard operating procedures for critical equipment.

## Documentation of Procedures and Methods
- Document all procedures and methods; maintain clear audit trails and document/version controls.
- Link secondary processed information to primary data; validate methods as fit for purpose with traceability.

## Research / Work Records
- Records must be detailed enough to replicate work; regular reviews by the Project Leader.
- Retain records securely and in appropriate formats; protect integrity against unauthorised modification.

## Field-based Research
- Comply with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution.
- Apply all JCoPR provisions to field-based activities.

## Annex – Documentary Evidence (examples by section)
