# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- This document provides a framework for the proper conduct of research funded by multiple UK government bodies and associated agencies, focusing on quality of research processes (QP) and the quality of science (QS), with an overarching principle of fitness for purpose.

## Background
- Originated from representatives of BBSRC, Defra, FSA, and NERC; subsequently endorsed by Northern Ireland, Scottish, and Welsh administrations, plus several agencies.
- Launched in May 2003; effective from 1 June 2004.
- Defra and FSA conducted a joint audit program starting in 2006; UKAS audited samples of funded projects.
- Revised by Defra, FSA, and others in light of audit findings; applies to all research funded by the listed bodies and to work in their own institutes.
- Aimed at ensuring research is fit for purpose, with provisions read in that context.

## Principles behind the Code
- Contractors should commit to both the quality of the research process (QP) and the quality of the science (QS).
- QS covers project aims, approaches, and knowledge extraction; QP covers rigorous, repeatable, auditable processes to gather and interpret results.
- Emphasizes best scientific practice from project start; compliance driven from top levels of organizations.
- Requires researchers to be competent and adequately trained; fitness for purpose underpins all judgments.

## Compliance with the Code
- FSA, Defra, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, and UK Devolved Administrations require acceptance of the Code in research proposals.
- Contractors should discuss inappropriate or non-applicable clauses; such discussions and the Code become part of funded project terms.
- Projects must be compliant; subcontractors must likewise follow the Code.
- For BBSRC- and NERC-funded work, annual acceptance of the Code is provided by the Institute Director.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code
- Organizations should have policies and processes to ensure compliance, applied consistently.
- Funding Bodies expect formal assurance mechanisms, ideally audited by an independent third party against an appropriate standard.
- Bodies reserve the right to verify compliance, including independent audits of a contractor’s research system.

## 1. Responsibilities
- Contractor organization owns overall research quality and policy compliance.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors promote good scientific practice and skill development.
- Principal Investigator/Project Leader is responsible for all work, including subcontracted activities; clear responsibilities must be documented for all staff.

## 2. Competence
- All project personnel must be competent for their tasks; trainees must be supervised adequately.
- Contractors must provide evidence of competence and safe performance; training records must demonstrate awareness of JCoPR provisions.

## 3. Project planning
- Conduct a risk assessment to identify factors influencing success and objective achievement.
- Maintain a clear, written project plan addressing research design, statistics, etc.; plan must be agreed with the Funding Body.
- Schedule regular timetable reviews; signifiant amendments require pre-approval.

## 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned processes to assure research quality; conduct regular fit-for-purpose reviews.
- Outputs must be authorised as agreed with the Funding Body; post-publication errors must be reported and corrective actions taken promptly.
- Regularly review processes as part of continual improvement.

## 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Label samples clearly, uniquely, durably; retain for an agreed period; storage and handling must be specified in the project plan.
- Monitor critical storage conditions; track samples through all stages; establish disposal routes and dates.

## 7. Facilities and equipment
- Working environment must support safe operation, sample integrity, and good practices.
- Regularly check and maintain facilities; ensure equipment is appropriate and calibrated; have contingency plans for disruptions.
- Maintain standard operating procedures for all critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- Document all procedures and methods; maintain an audit trail with document/version control linking processed information to primary data.
- Validate methods as fit for purpose; modifications must be traceable through development stages.

## 9. Research / work records
- Records must be detailed enough to repeat work; project leadership should regularly review staff records.
- Record locations of all critical data; retain records with integrity and security for an agreed period.

## 10. Field-based research
- Field activities must comply with environmental legislation; laboratories must manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution.
- All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based research as well.
