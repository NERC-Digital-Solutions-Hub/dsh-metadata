# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Background
- Jointly developed by BBSRC, Defra, FSA, NERC; subsequently endorsed by Northern Ireland, Scottish, and Welsh administrations, and additional agencies (APHA, Fera, FC, MMO, NE, VMD).
- Launched May 2003; effective 1 June 2004; UKAS audits started in 2006 to check compliance of funded projects.
- Revised in light of audit findings; applies to all research funded by the listed bodies and to BBSRC/NERC research in their institutes.
- Principle: fitness for purpose; intended to apply to all types of research with emphasis on appropriate purpose and usable provisions.

## Principles behind the Code
- Contractors should commit to:
  - Quality of the research process (QP): rigorous, repeatable, auditable procedures.
  - Quality of the science (QS): aims, approaches, and extraction of new knowledge.
- Emphasis on “best scientific practice” from project start; compliance driven from the top of funded organisations.
- Framework aims to ensure proper conduct, with fitness for purpose as the overriding principle; researchers must be competent and adequately trained.

## Compliance with the Code
- Funding bodies require contractors to indicate acceptance of the Code when proposals are submitted; discussions on inapplicable clauses may occur, and such discussions become part of funding terms.
- Contractors responsible for ensuring project compliance and for making subcontractors aware of the Code.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director is required.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code
- Organisations should have policies/processes to ensure compliance; third-party audits against appropriate standards are expected where possible.
- Funding Bodies may audit or request evidence that projects meet the standard.
- This monitoring underpins assurance of research quality.

## 1. Responsibilities
- The contractor is responsible for overall research quality, including internal policies.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors promote good scientific practice and skill development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader is responsible for all work in the project, including subcontractors; clear responsibilities must be defined for all staff.

## 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; training must be supervised to avoid compromising quality.
- Contractors must provide evidence of capability and maintain training records demonstrating awareness of the Code.

## 3. Project planning
- Conduct risk assessment to identify factors affecting success and objective achievement.
- Maintain a clear, written project plan addressing design, statistics, etc.; plan must be agreed with the Funding Body and aligned with ethical/licensing requirements.
- Schedule regular reviews of timelines; significant amendments require pre-approval.

## 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned processes to assure research quality; conduct fit-for-purpose reviews at appropriate frequencies.
- Output authorization requires Funding Body approval; post-publication errors must be reported and corrective action taken promptly.
- Regularly review processes as part of continual improvement.

## 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Labeling must be clear, accurate, unique, and durable; retention periods to be agreed with the Funding Body.
- Storage conditions must be specified and monitored if critical; samples must be tracked and have disposal routes/dates.

## 7. Facilities and equipment
- Working environment must ensure safe operation, sample quality, and good practices.
- Special facilities must be maintained; equipment must be calibrated and in good condition.
- Contingency plans for critical equipment (e.g., power disruption) and SOPs for key equipment must exist.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- Document all procedures and methods; maintain audit trails with document/version controls.
- Include validation of methods as fit for purpose; trace modifications through development.

## 9. Research / work records
- Records must be detailed enough to reproduce work; project leader ensures validity through regular reviews.
- Record locations and retention must preserve integrity and security, preventing unauthorized modification, for a period defined with the Funding Body.

## 10. Field-based research
- Fieldwork must comply with environmental legislation; laboratories must manage discharges/emissions to minimize pollution.
- All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based activities.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence
- Responsibilities: organisation chart, personnel lists, sub-contractor agreements, clearly defined roles.
- Competence: CVs, up-to-date training records, awareness of Code obligations.
- Project planning: risk assessments, updated plans with milestones, approved procedures, licences/ethical approvals.
- Quality Control: internal ‘fit-for-purpose’ reviews, internal audits, publication approval procedures.
- Health & safety: training/compliance documentation (e.g., Health & Safety Plan).
- Handling of samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures, storage logs.
- Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records, SOPs, emergency procedures.
- Documentation of procedures & methods: robust document/version control, validated SOPs.
- Research/work records: counter-signed notebooks or indexed data, archiving procedures.
- Field-based research: documented risk assessments for field activities.
