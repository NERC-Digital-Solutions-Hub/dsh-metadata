# Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Programme

## Overview and aim
- Welsh Government programme to monitor environmental effects of the Glastir agri-environment scheme.
- Focus on soil health and its relation to climate change, biodiversity, soil and water quality, and woodland expansion.
- Purpose includes assessing status and trends in soil quality and identifying drivers of change (land use, climate, pollution) beyond Glastir interventions.
- Analysts are expected to integrate data across scales, verify quality, and present findings in standardized formats.

## Survey design and objectives
- Adopts a multi-metric, ecosystem-based approach with data collected across multiple scales in a single visit when possible.
- Implements a 4-year rolling survey cycle to maximise site coverage and detect spatial variation and temporal trends cost-effectively.
- Two main components:
  - Wider Wales Component: baseline estimation, national trends, and national reporting.
  - Targeted Component: links to Glastir priority areas.
- Uses a common spatial unit of 1 km squares for integration across components.
- Sampling framework mirrors the Countryside Survey of Great Britain to enable future data integration; 300 1-km squares sampled over the four-year cycle.
- Exclusion criteria: random squares with >75% urban land or >90% sea excluded.
- Spatial distribution shown at 10 km for confidentiality.

## Sampling framework and field design
- 300 x 1-km survey squares sampled over four years; half are Wider Wales squares, other half targeted to Glastir priority areas.
- Within each 1-km square, soil samples collected from 5 randomly dispersed locations where possible.
- Soil fauna analysis conducted on cores collected with a white plastic 8 cm core (F-core), coincident with vegetation surveys.
- Cores posted to Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), Lancaster for faunal extraction.

## Data collection and handling
- In-field data captured on recording sheets with fields such as SQXN, depth, start/stop times, etc., then transferred to Excel.
- Sample preparation and extraction:
  - Dry extraction via Tullgren funnels (6+ units) with 40 W bulbs, using 70% ethanol as preservative.
  - On arrival, extract white cores, measure depth, and place soil on mesh for extraction.
  - Typical extraction period: 5 days (adjusted for weekends).
  - Post-extraction, samples stored in labeled tubes and racks; cores cleaned and stored for future processing.
- Invertebrate identification protocol:
  - Separate mesofauna from debris; identify to broad groups (detailed categories provided in the protocol).
  - Tallies recorded per broad group; specimens stored in glass blocks and later transferred to labeled vials with SQXN.
  - Quality control: 1 in 20 samples checked by a second staff member to ensure consistency; objective is reproducible identifications and counts.
- Data management:
  - Data entered into Excel during processing; core data later integrated into CEH Bangor database.
  - Example dataset: GMEP_TOPSOIL_MESOFAUNA_2013_14.csv, capturing counts of various mesofauna groups across 147 1-km sites.

## Equipment and procedures
- Key equipment: Stereomicroscope, Petri dishes, pipettes, fine brushes, ethanol spray, glass blocks/vials, labeling materials, and recording notebooks.
- Core preparation and labeling steps are specified to ensure traceability (SQXN labeling on tubes and lids).
- Detailed step-by-step procedure for core handling, labeling, measurement, and transfer to funnels for extraction.

## Health & safety and quality assurance
- Health & Safety: Ethanol handling is a noted hazard; risk assessments and safe handling procedures are required.
- Quality assurance: Adherence to the DEFRA Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR); independent cross-checks (1 in 20 samples) to compare identifications between staff; repeated QA checks as sampling proceeds to maintain consistency and reliability.

## Data management, outputs, and reporting
- Outputs are integrated into a national database (CEH Bangor) after initial Excel-based data entry.
- Data templates and standardized fields (e.g., SQXN) support integration and cross-survey comparability.
- Presence of a published data file (GMEP_TOPSOIL_MESOFAUNA_2013_14.csv) illustrating counts by sample and taxonomic group across multiple 1-km squares; includes coordinates, land classification, core taken status, and totals for mites, collembolans, and total invertebrates.

## Roles and responsibilities (Appendix)
- Key roles include: soil meso-fauna topic lead, data management and QA, sample management, field team leadership, field coordination, and project management.
- Field survey teams comprise a broad roster of named personnel responsible for data collection, sample handling, and field operations.
