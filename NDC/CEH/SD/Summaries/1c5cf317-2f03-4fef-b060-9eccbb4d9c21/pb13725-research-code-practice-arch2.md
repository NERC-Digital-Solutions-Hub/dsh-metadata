# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- Aimed at ensuring consistent, high-quality environmental research data and outputs across organisations with statutory monitoring responsibilities.
- Developed by a range of UK funding bodies and public agencies; applicable to Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, Devolved Administrations, and to BBSRC/NERC in their own institutes.
- Launched in May 2003; effective from June 1, 2004; subject to updates after audits (notably UKAS) and workshops (2009).

## Principles behind the Code

- Quality of research process (QP) and quality of science (QS) are both essential.
- QS focuses on aims, approaches, and knowledge extraction; QP ensures rigorous, repeatable, auditable processes.
- Emphasis on “fitness for purpose” and best scientific practice from the outset.
- Compliance is driven from the top of funded organisations and requires adequate training and competence.

## Compliance with the Code

- Contractors must indicate acceptance when submitting proposals; as applicable, discuss inappropriateness or non-applicability with the Funding Body.
- Code becomes part of funding terms and conditions; formal risk assessments may be required.
- Contractors bear responsibility for ensuring project and subcontractor compliance.
- For BBSRC/NERC, annual acceptance of the Code is required by Institute Directors.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code

- Organisations should have policies and processes to ensure ongoing compliance.
- Ideally, a formal, third-party audited quality system (fit-for-purpose standard) is used to assure research quality.
- Funding Bodies may audit contractor systems to verify adherence.

## 1. Responsibilities

- The contracting organisation holds overall quality responsibility, including policy compliance.
- Managers and supervisors promote good scientific practice and skills development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader oversees all work, including that of subcontractors; clear roles and responsibilities must be defined.

## 2. Competence

- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; training must be supervised to avoid compromising results.
- Documented evidence of capability and up-to-date training records are required.

## 3. Project planning

- Conduct risk assessment to identify factors affecting success and objective attainment.
- Maintain a clear written plan, agreed with the Funding Body, including research design and statistical methods.
- Regularly review timetables and plans; major amendments require pre-approval.

## 4. Quality Control

- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes; conduct formal reviews at appropriate intervals.
- Outputs require Funding Body approval and senior-level authorization.
- If errors are found post-publication, notify the Funding Body and implement corrective actions; pursue continual improvement.

## 5. Health and Safety

- All work must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of samples and materials

- Clear, durable labeling; retention period defined with the Funding Body; proper storage conditions monitored and recorded.
- Traceability of samples through all stages and defined disposal routes/dates.

## 7. Facilities and equipment

- Safe, appropriate working environment; regular maintenance of facilities (e.g., fume hoods) and equipment.
- Equipment calibrated at defined intervals; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods

- All procedures and methods must be documented, with audit trails, document/version control, and linkage to primary data.
- Validation of methods as fit for purpose; traceable modifications through development stages.

## 9. Research / work records

- Records must enable repetition of work and present a complete project picture.
- Project Leader ensures validity through regular staff record reviews.
- Critical data and records must be securely stored and retained for an agreed period, with clear storage locations.

## 10. Field-based research

- Compliance with environmental legislation for fieldwork; manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution.
- All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based activities.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence

- Responsibilities: organisation chart, personnel lists (incl. sub-contractors), documented subcontractor adherence, roles/responsibilities.
- Personnel competence: CVs, training records, awareness of Code requirements.
- Project planning: risk assessments, reviews of plans, approved project plans with milestones, validated statistical plans, sampling procedures, ethical approvals/licences.
- Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews, internal audits, corrective actions, publication authorisation procedures.
- Health & safety: training/compliance documents (e.g., Health & Safety Plan), discipline-specific safety measures.
- Handling of samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures, storage logs.
- Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records, SOPs, emergency procedures.
- Documentation of procedures & methods: document/version control, validated SOPs.
- Research/work records: counter-signed lab notebooks or indexed electronic files, archiving procedures.
- Field-based research: documented risk assessments for field activities.
