# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Background
- Developed by a group of UK funding and regulatory bodies (BBSRC, Defra, FSA, NERC) and endorsed by others (NI, Scottish & Welsh Governments; APHA, Fera, FC, MMO, Natural England, VMD).
- Launched May 2003; effective 1 June 2004.
- Defra and FSA conducted a joint audit programme (began 2006) with UKAS to assess compliance of funded projects.
- Revised in light of audit/workshop outcomes; applies to all research funded by the listed bodies and to research in their own institutes.
- Principle: fitness for purpose; emphasis on practical, well-founded, and auditable research processes.

## Principles behind the Code
- Emphasis on two quality pillars:
  - Quality of the research process (QP): rigour, repeatability, audibility of methods.
  - Quality of the science (QS): aims, approaches, and extraction of new knowledge.
- Promote best scientific practice from project start; compliance should be driven from the top of organisations.
- Projects should be conducted by competent, adequately trained researchers.

## Compliance with the Code
- Contractors must indicate acceptance of the Code in research proposals; discussions on inappropriate clauses may be recorded and become part of funding terms.
- Contractors must ensure all subcontractors comply with the Code.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director is required.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code
- Organisations should have policies and processes to ensure compliance; apply them consistently.
- Funding Bodies encourage assurance via formal systems audited by independent third parties against recognized standards.
- The Bodies may audit funded projects or contractor systems to verify compliance.

## Specific requirements of the Code

### 1. Responsibilities
- The contractor organisation is accountable for overall research quality and compliance with in-house policies.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors must foster good scientific practice.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader is responsible for all project work, including that of subcontractors; clear responsibilities must be defined for all staff and students.

### 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent to perform their tasks; trainees must be supervised to protect quality.
- Contractors must provide documented evidence of competency and safety, with training records indicating awareness of the Code’s provisions.

### 3. Project planning
- Conduct an appropriate risk assessment; develop a clear written project plan addressing design, statistics, and other factors.
- Plans must be agreed with the Funding Body and consider ethical approvals or licenses if relevant.
- Schedule regular plan reviews; major amendments require pre-approval.

### 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes.
- Outputs require appropriate authorisation; senior approval where applicable.
- Report errors post-publication to the Funding Body and take corrective actions promptly.
- Use continual improvement to review processes and procedures.

### 5. Health and Safety
- Compliance with all relevant Health and Safety regulations is mandatory.

### 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Label all samples/materials clearly, durably, and uniquely; retain for an agreed period.
- Storage conditions must be specified and monitored if critical.
- Track samples through analysis/use with defined disposal routes and dates.

### 7. Facilities and equipment
- Work environment must support safe operation, sample integrity, and good practice.
- Regular calibration and maintenance of equipment; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment.

### 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- Document all procedures and methods; maintain an audit trail with document/version control linking analyses to primary data.
- Validate methods for fitness for purpose; trace modifications through development.

### 9. Research / work records
- Records must be detailed enough to reproduce work; regular reviews by the Project Leader.
- Locate and retain all critical data; ensure integrity, security, and protection against unauthorized modification, for a period agreed with the Funding Body.

### 10. Field-based research
- Comply with environmental legislation; manage discharges/emissions to minimise pollution risks.
- Apply all provisions of the JCoPR to field-based activities.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence
- Responsibilities: organisation chart, personnel lists (including sub-contractors), documented subcontractor adherence to JCoPR, defined roles.
- Personnel competence: CVs, up-to-date training records, evidence of awareness of Code obligations.
- Project planning: risk assessments, reviewed plans, approved milestones, validated statistical procedures, sampling procedures, ethical approvals/licences.
- Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews, audits, corrective actions, publication authorization policy.
- Health & safety: training/compliance documentation (e.g., Laboratory Health & Safety Plan), specific risk measures.
- Handling of samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures, storage logs.
- Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records, routine facility maintenance, SOPs for critical equipment.
- Documentation of procedures & methods: robust document/version control, validated SOPs.
- Research/work records: counter-signed or indexed records, consistent archiving.
- Field-based research: documented risk assessments for field activities.
