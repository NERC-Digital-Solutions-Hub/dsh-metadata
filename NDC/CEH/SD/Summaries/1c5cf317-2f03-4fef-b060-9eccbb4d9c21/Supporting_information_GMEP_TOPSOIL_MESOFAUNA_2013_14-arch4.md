# Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Programme Soil Monitoring (GMEP)

- Purpose: Welsh Government programme to monitor Glastir scheme effects on soil and overall environmental outcomes (climate, biodiversity, soil and water quality, woodland expansion) and to quantify soil status and trends beyond Glastir interventions.
- Data-system aim for data leaders: establish an ecosystem-wide, multi-scale, integrated data approach with shared spatial units and pathways for data discovery, quality, and dissemination.

## Data System and Survey Design

- 4-year rolling survey (2013–2016) to capture spatial variation and temporal changes cost-effectively.
- Two components:
  - Wider Wales Component: baseline estimation and national trends.
  - Targeted Component: links to Glastir priority areas.
- Common spatial unit: 1 km square, enabling integration with Countryside Survey data.
- Sampling: 300 1 km squares (half random within Land Classification strata, half targeted at Glastir priorities); exclusions for urban-dominated or sea-dominated squares.
- Map coverage: distribution shown at 10 km resolution to protect data confidentiality.
- Sampling framework aligns with robust national/sub-national indicators.

## Sampling, Sample Collection, and Processing

- In each square, soil samples collected from 5 randomly dispersed locations using a white 8 cm F-core, coinciding with vegetation surveys.
- Samples mailed promptly to Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) Lancaster for mesofauna extraction.
- Dry extraction: 5-day incubation in Tullgren funnels with 70% ethanol as preservative; standardized equipment and labeling required.
- Data capture: recording sheets in Excel with fields such as SQXN, depth, start/stop times, etc.
- Laboratory workflow stresses freshness of samples and careful handling to avoid cross-mixing.

## Invertebrate Identification and Data Recording

- Objective: separate mesofauna from debris and classify into predefined broad groups (mites, Collembola, etc.), with counts by group.
- Identification protocol emphasizes high magnification, separation accuracy, and consistent tallying in recording notebooks.
- Post-processing: specimens assigned to labeled glass blocks, then to vials with SQXN labels; quality control by a second staff member on 1 in 20 samples to ensure comparability of identifications.
- Data entry into Excel for subsequent integration into CEH Bangor’s database.

## Data Management, Quality Assurance, and Integration

- Data management responsibilities include data QA, sample tracking, and data integration with centralized databases.
- Adheres to DEFRA Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR) for quality assurance.
- QA approach includes independent cross-checking (1 in 20 samples) and ongoing verification as sampling proceeds.
- Final data product exemplified by the GMEP_TOPSOIL_MESOFAUNA_2013_14.csv, detailing counts across multiple groups (mites, Oribatida, Collembola, etc.) and derived totals (TOTAL_MITES, TOTAL_COLL, TOTAL_INVERT, etc.).
- Metadata and structure designed to enable future integration with national datasets and cross-surveys (e.g., Countryside Survey).

## Data Product, Metadata, and Access

- Primary dataset: GMEP_TOPSOIL_MESOFAUNA_2013_14.csv, with detailed field definitions for sampling, taxonomic groups, and derived totals.
- Data structure supports national and sub-national indicators, with explicit columns for geographic coordinates, land classification, and sample identifiers.
- Emphasis on data discoverability and compatibility through standardized 1 km squares and shared data templates.

## Roles, Governance, and Training

- Appendix outlines roles and responsibilities (e.g., Soil meso-fauna topic leader, GMEP Lead Scientist, data management, field coordination).
- Field survey teams consist of a broad roster of researchers and technicians.
- Training: minimum one week of familiarisation with broad-group identification, voucher specimen handling, and mock sample processing.
- Data governance and coordination across teams to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

## Health, Safety, and Ethics

- Health and safety considerations for chemical handling (ethanol) and risk assessments for SOPs.
- Procedures emphasize minimizing exposure and complying with safety standards.

## References, Appendices, and Data Context

- References to foundational methodology and prior surveys (e.g., Land Classification, Countryside Survey, Collembola keys).
- Appendix provides organizational context and field team roster, illustrating governance and operational structure.

## Key Takeaways for Data Leaders

- Establishes a robust, multi-scale data system that integrates soil health indicators across time and space using a standardized 1 km grid.
- Emphasizes data discovery, metadata consistency, and interoperability with national datasets (e.g., Countryside Survey).
- Demonstrates rigorous QA processes, including independent verification to ensure data reliability and comparability across personnel.
- Highlights the importance of clear roles, training, and governance to maintain data quality and allow future data integration and analysis.
- Provides a concrete data product (CSV) with detailed variable definitions and derived metrics to support monitoring and reporting at national and regional levels.
