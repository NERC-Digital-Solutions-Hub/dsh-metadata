# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A governance framework for research funded by UK bodies to ensure fitness for purpose and high scientific and research process quality.
- Endorsed and implemented by multiple government departments, agencies, and research councils; launched in 2003 and effective from 1 June 2004.
- Includes periodic monitoring and third-party audits (e.g., UKAS) to assess compliance; revised after audit findings.

## Background
- Developed by BBSRC, Defra, FSA, NERC; subsequently endorsed by Devolved Administrations and other agencies (APHA, Fera, FC, MMO, NE, VMD).
- Applies to all funded research across listed organisations and institutes.
- Emphasises alignment of research quality (QS) and research process quality (QP); aims for diligent, competent, and trained researchers.

## Principles behind the Code
- Contractors must pursue both QS (aims, approaches, knowledge extraction) and QP (rigour, repeatability, auditable processes).
- Commitment to best scientific practice from the top levels of funded organisations.
- Overriding principle: fitness for purpose; researchers should be competent and adequately trained.

## Compliance with the Code
- Funding bodies require acceptance of the Code at proposal submission; discussions on inappropriate clauses can be documented and included in funding terms.
- Risk assessments may be conducted; contractors must ensure subcontractors adhere to JCoPR.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by Institute Director is required.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code
- Organisations should have policies and processes to ensure compliance, and ideally operate a formal quality assurance system audited by an independent third party.
- Bodies reserve the right to audit funded projects or contractor systems to verify standards.

## 1. Responsibilities
- Contractor organisation is accountable for overall research quality and compliance with internal policies.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors foster good scientific practice and skill development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader holds responsibility for all project work, including subcontractors.

## 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; trainees must be supervised to protect quality.
- Contractors must provide documented evidence of capability and maintain training records.

## 3. Project planning
- Conduct appropriate risk assessments to anticipate factors affecting success.
- Maintain a clear written project plan addressing design, statistical methods, and other requirements; plan to be agreed with the Funding Body.
- Schedule regular timetable reviews; major amendments require pre-approval.

## 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned processes to assure research quality; conduct regular fit-for-purpose reviews.
- Outputs require authorization by Funding Body or senior management; notify and address post-publication errors quickly.
- Embrace continual improvement of procedures.

## 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with applicable health and safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Label samples accurately and durably; retain for a period agreed with the Funding Body.
- Store and handle samples per project plans; monitor critical storage conditions; track samples through analysis; define disposal routes and dates.

## 7. Facilities and equipment
- Ensure a safe, appropriate working environment; regular maintenance of facilities and equipment.
- Calibrate equipment at appropriate intervals; have contingency plans for disruptions.
- Maintain standard operating procedures for critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- Document all procedures and methods; maintain an auditable trail with version control.
- Include validation of methods and ensure traceability from primary data to processed information.

## 9. Research / work records
- Records must be detailed enough to replicate work; regularly reviewed by the Project Leader.
- Store and secure records (hard copy and electronic); prevent unauthorized modification; retain for the period required by the Funding Body.

## 10. Field-based research
- Comply with relevant environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimise pollution risk.
- Apply all JCoPR provisions to field-based research as appropriate.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence
- Provides concrete evidence types for each category (e.g., organisation structure, roles and responsibilities, training records, risk assessments, project plans, internal audits, SOPs, sample tracking logs, equipment maintenance records, documentation controls, archiving procedures, and field risk assessments).
