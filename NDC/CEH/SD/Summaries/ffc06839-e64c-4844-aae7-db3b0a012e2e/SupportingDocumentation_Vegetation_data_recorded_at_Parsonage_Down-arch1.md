# Long-term change in calcareous grassland vegetation and drivers over three time periods between 1970 and 2016

- Purpose: Document long-term vegetation change at Parsonage Down National Nature Reserve (NNR) across three time periods (1970, 1990, 2016) and provide associated soil data to explore drivers of change.

## Study area
- Location: Parsonage Down NNR, Wiltshire (188 ha chalk grassland).
- History: Designated NNR in 1973; land managed with grazing (cattle and sheep) and no fertilisers under Natural England stewardship; stocking levels varied over time.
- Relevance: Grassland composition and soil properties linked to historical management and environmental drivers.

## Survey method and data collection
- Vegetation sampling:
  - Four transects established in 1970; transect lengths: 111 ft, 102 ft, 60 ft, 60 ft.
  - Domin scale (10-point) used to record vascular plants and bryophytes in 20 cm x 20 cm quadrats every 3 ft along each transect, totaling 115 quadrats per year.
  - Species identified to species level (Taraxacum microspecies exception); average sward height measured per quadrat.
  - Data recorded: transect number, quadrat number (N/S orientation), vegetation height (cm), recorder initials, and species list.
- Soil sampling:
  - 22 soil samples per survey year, distributed along all four transects at two depths (0–5 cm and 5–10 cm).
  - Analyzed for pH, loss on ignition (LOI), exchangeable K, Ca, Mg, phosphate (PO4-P), and total N.
  - Detailed methodologies provided for each soil parameter (e.g., pH measurement procedure, LOI protocol, ICP-OES for Ca/K/Mg, Olsen’s PO4-P extraction, and total N analysis).
- Temporal scope: Data collected for 1970, 1990, and 2016 using methods consistent with plants and soils across years.

## Transect relocation and georeferencing
- 2016 re-survey: Transects relocated by geo-referencing Wells' original 1970 maps to CEH and archaeological GIS layers, ensuring accurate alignment with Celtic field boundaries.
- Rationale: Reduces pseudo-turnover risk due to misplacement; ensures comparable spatial positioning across time periods.
- Data collection in 2016: Vegetation and soil data recorded in the same locations and roughly the same time of year as earlier surveys.

## Locating transects and plots
- Precise grid references recorded for transect starts/ends (±2 m accuracy) and quadrat numbering system (N/S orientation and 0–60 ft range).
- Table and figure references provide the exact coordinates for reproducibility and re-location checks.

## Data structure and availability
- Vegetation data: PD_SurveyData1970.csv, PD_SurveyData1990.csv, PD_SurveyData2016.csv
  - Fields include: Transect, Quadrat number, Vegetation height, Recorder, Species list (vascular plants and bryophytes).
- Soil data: PD_SoilData.csv
  - Fields include: Transect, Position (feet and N/S), Sample Depth, LOI, pH, K, Ca, Mg, PO4-P, N.
  - Note: For transect 3, 1970 and 1990 only one soil sample per position; 0–5 cm data may reflect 0–10 cm depth.
  
## Quality control
- Experienced botanical surveyors worked in pairs (or threes); one surveyor contributed to both 1970 and 2016 surveys to maintain methodological consistency.
- Transects were relocated as accurately as possible to maintain comparability across time periods.
