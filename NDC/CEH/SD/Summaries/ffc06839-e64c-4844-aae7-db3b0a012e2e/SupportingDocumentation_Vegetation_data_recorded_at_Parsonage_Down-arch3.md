# Long-term change in calcareous grassland vegetation and drivers over three time periods between 1970 and 2016

## Purpose and scope
- Data were created for a study examining long-term vegetation change at Parsonage Down National Nature Reserve (NNR) from 1970 to 2016.
- Aims align with monitoring framework goals: identify environmental health measures, scrutinise policy implications, and inform future decisions.

## Study area
- Parsonage Down NNR, Wiltshire (188 ha of chalk grassland).
- Designation as NNR in 1973.
- Land management: historically grazed with cattle and sheep; since Natural England ownership, continued grazing without fertilizer; grazing intensity more variable in later periods.

## Survey methodology
- Four transects established in 1970 (Wells) across a CG2 Festuca ovina - Avenula pratensis grassland.
- Vegetation recorded using the Domin scale (10 categories) in 20 cm x 20 cm quadrats every 3 ft, totaling 115 quadrats per year.
- Vascular plants identified to species level (Taraxacum microspecies excluded) and sward height measured per quadrat.
- Soil sampling: 22 samples per transect at depths 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm; analyzed for pH, LOI, exchangeable K, Mg, Ca, PO4-P, and total N.
- Data files: vegetation datasets for 1970, 1990, and 2016; soil dataset with all samples.

## Transect and plot localization, quality control
- 2016 re-survey re-located transects by geo-referencing Wells’ original maps (1:125 scale) using CEH archaeological GIS layers to verify Celtic field boundaries; wooden markers were no longer present.
- Accurate relocation essential to avoid pseudo-turnover in long-term comparisons.
- Start/end points and quadrat references recorded with high precision (±2 m) in 2016.
- Data collection performed by experienced botanists in pairs (or threes), with continuity ensured by one surveyor present in 1970 and 2016.

## Data structure and files
- Vegetation data: PD_SurveyData1970.csv, PD_SurveyData1990.csv, PD_SurveyData2016.csv
  - Variables include: Transect number, Quadrats (N/S designation), Quadrat number, Vegetation height (cm), Recorder, Species (vascular plants and bryophytes recorded)
- Soil data: PD_SoilData.csv
  - Variables include: Transect, Position, Sample Depth, LOI, pH, K, Ca, Mg, PO4-P, N
  - Note: For transect 3, 1970 and 1990 have one soil sample per position; 0–5 cm value reflects 0–10 cm depth.
- Data quality: Consistent methodology across time; careful documentation of recording methods and equipment; cross-year comparability maintained through standardized protocols.

## Temporal comparability and governance considerations
- Re-survey methodology emphasizes replicability and data integrity to support long-term monitoring.
- Metadata and dataset provenance are maintained to facilitate verification and reuse by others.
- Transparency in data collection and the openness of underlying data are prioritized to align with monitoring governance needs.
