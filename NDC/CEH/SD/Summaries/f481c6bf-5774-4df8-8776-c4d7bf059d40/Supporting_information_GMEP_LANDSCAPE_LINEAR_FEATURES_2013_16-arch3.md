# Glastir Monitoring & Evaluation Programme

- Purpose and context
  - Welsh Government monitoring programme (GMEP) established in 2013 to assess the environmental effects of the Glastir agri-environment scheme and contribute to biodiversity evidence and CBD 2020 obligations.
  - Aims include measuring landscape features and biodiversity to track progress against commitments and inform future policy.

- Survey design and rolling cycle
  - 4-year rolling survey cycle (first cycle 2013–2016) to maximise national coverage while enabling year-to-year monitoring of spatial and temporal changes cost-effectively.
  - Two interconnected components:
    - Wider Wales Component: baseline estimates and national trends for Glastir reporting.
    - Targeted Component: links specifically to Glastir priority areas.
  - Integration across metrics via a common spatial unit of 1 km grid.
  - Sampling plan: 300 1 km squares over the cycle.
    - Half randomly sampled within strata defined by the Land Classification of Great Britain (ITE classification) to capture environmental heterogeneity.
    - Half targeted at Glastir priority areas.
  - Exclusion criteria: remove squares with >75% urban land or >90% sea.
  - Alignment with Countryside Survey GB methodology to enable robust national/sub-national indicators and potential future integration with GB analyses.

- Data collection and measurement
  - Within each 1 km square, landscape linear features mapped using pre-defined coded options; data captured digitally with CS Surveyor (EC-Hydrology/Esri) to minimize post-field digitising errors.
  - Features recorded: linear landscape elements (hedges, lines of trees, walls, fences, streams, etc.) with minimum 20 m length and up to 20 m gaps; focus on woody linear features (WLF) and related attributes.
  - Woody linear features classified using a defined key with stakeholder consultation (Hedgerow Steering Group).
  - Two primary data files:
    - LANDSCAPE_LINEAR_FEATURES_2013_16.csv: feature identifiers, location, sampling framework (LC), coordinates, event ranges, length, theme, habitat, historic management, vegetation indicators, etc.
    - LANDSCAPE_LINEAR_FEATURE_SP_2013_16.csv: species-level data for woody features (VEGETATION_TYPE, SPECIES, PROPORTION) with references to the corresponding feature.
  - Vegetation composition data for woody features recorded (species and cover percentages); nomenclature aligned with Stace (1997).
  - Field team training and QA: intensive training, on-site supervision, use of mandatory data fields and prompts to ensure consistency; rapid data transfer for timely quality checks.

- Quality assurance, metadata and governance
  - QA processes include field team supervision, a dedicated QA (QC) team that re-surveys all or part of squares and feeds issues back to field teams.
  - Electronic data capture reduces errors, supports data integrity, and facilitates transparency.
  - Metadata and data governance considerations emphasized; sharing of underlying data and classification references to support reproducibility and future integration.
  - Methodological references and handbooks underpin consistent data collection (GMEP Field Mapping Handbooks).

- Outputs, publications and references
  - Key references and resources for methodology and data include:
    - ITE Land Classification of Great Britain 2007 (Bunce et al.)
    - GMEP Field Mapping Handbooks (Maskell et al. 2016)
    - Glastir Monitoring & Evaluation Programme annual and final reports (Welsh Government, CEH)
    - GMEP website and related documentation (gmep.wales)
    - Supplementary guidance on biodiversity classifications and habitat descriptions (e.g., Stace 1997)

- Appendix: roles and teams
  - Roles and responsibilities listed for database management, field team leadership, survey design and statistics, vegetation expertise, GIS, project management, and field co-ordination.
  - Field survey teams enumerated, indicating the breadth of field personnel involved in data collection.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates designing a multi-metric, ecosystem-based monitoring programme with:
    - A rolling, interval-based survey cadence
    - Spatially explicit, nationally representative sampling with targeted components
    - Integrated data collection across measures and scales
    - Rigorous QA, standardized digital data capture, and transparent governance
    - Structured data formats and clear documentation to support future analyses and data sharing
