# GLASTIR MONITORING & EVALUATION PROGRAMME MAPPING FIELD HANDBOOK Part 2: using Surveyor software

## Purpose and scope
- Provides field protocol for mapping habitat areas, ponds, points, and linear features using the Surveyor extension in ArcMap for the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (GMEP).
- Aims to enable consistent data capture, editing, and attribute management across 1 km grid squares and CS squares; supports data quality, sharing, and re-use.

## System, access, and orientation
- Uses ArcMap with the CS Surveyor extension; built on a CEH/ESRI customization.
- Requires login to the Surveyor extension; main survey user and QA user credentials provided.
- Data stored in a Countryside Survey data frame; map displays show layers with pre-set symbology.
- Essential tools: navigation (zoom/pan), select, identify, find, measure; editing requires being in an edit session (< 1:5000 scale).
- Save and log-off procedures are critical: end sessions via the Surveyor toolbox and choose Save Session to preserve edits; otherwise changes are discarded.

## Data layers and preparation
- Workspace includes: Grids and sectors, OS MasterMap, historic features, landscape points/lines/areas, aerial photos, etc.
- Layers’ visibility and order can be adjusted; OS MasterMap polygons can be prioritized for copying into edit sketches.
- Transparency, drawing order, and scale settings can be customized to facilitate editing.

## Methodology for Mapping Polygons (Habitat Areas)
### Split
- Create polygons from a 1 km square polygon (new CS squares) or by copying polygons from external layers (e.g., OS MasterMap).
- Simple split through sketching; large splits may require a doughnut polygon for inner cuts.
- Attribute editor opens for each split part; input required attributes for each new area.

### Copying polygons from existing layers
- Copy from polygon layers (e.g., OS MasterMap); add features to the edit sketch with Copy+; refine with vertex editing.
- Areas to be split show as blue/black outlines; copied polygons may exclude certain layers.

### Modify
- Edit boundaries by manipulating vertices; shared boundary end vertices are edited via Shared Nodes Modify.
- Save changes to apply spatial edits; ensure edits reflect ground truth.

### Merge
- Merge multiple areas with identical attributes; choose a source area to copy attributes from; merged polygon inherits attributes from the source.
- Attributes overwritten at both area and component levels.

### Update
- Creates a new landscape area by splitting/merging existing polygons; useful for adding areas that intersect many existing polygons.
- Update polygon can copy attributes from intersecting areas or from copied features; can be used in place of multiple Split/Merge edits.

### Attributes
- Polygon-level attributes include area, Broad/Priority habitat, BH accuracy, reason for change, and visit status.
- Broad Habitat and habitat-specific fields guided by a vegetation key and themed groups (Agricultural Crops, Forestry, Inland Physiography, etc.).
- Visit status options: In progress, Completed, Refused access.

### Copy Attributes
- Copy attributes from a source area to multiple target areas; one source, many targets; target areas receive the source’s attributes and must be reviewed.

### Mapping change in CS squares
- Repeating CS squares use data from previous surveys; focus on extent and attributes rather than exact spatial precision.
- Possible change reasons include error changes, new baselines, or not previously surveyed; mandatory fields must be completed accordingly.

## Ponds: grid square inventory and survey pond selection
- If ponds exist in a grid square, complete the Grid Square Inventory for Ponds form on a tablet; one form per pond.
- Attributes to record per pond include square/pond references, area (max winter water level), presence/absence of water, reason for loss if marked on base map, new ponds, age and creation reasons, and notes.
- Survey pond selection process: random selection from ponds in the square after inventory is complete; once selected, record as Pond sampled under Inland Water theme.
- The survey pond is the single pond chosen for condition assessment; selection uses a lookup table generated by the tablet form.

## Methodology for Mapping Point Features
- Points are features under 20x20 m; listed under all themes (e.g., trees, standing water, ponds).
- Editing at the Points tab; scale must be 1:5000 or less to edit/add/move points; minimum distance between points is 5 m.
### 5.1 New
- Add new point at chosen map location; enter attributes; new points start with Unsurveyed/Missing Data component.
### 5.2 Modify
- Move an existing point; preserve its component structure; attributes updated on move; completed status may change appearance.
### 5.3 Delete
- Delete a point only if it has a valid Reason for Change; otherwise edit attributes first.
### 5.4 Attributes
- Edit point attributes; points may have multiple components; required values highlighted; changes visible after refreshing.
### 5.5 Copy Attributes
- Copy attributes from a source point to multiple target points; target points updated to match source; one source, many targets.

## Methodology for Mapping Linear Features
- Linear features are features along lines (minimum length 20 m, maximum width 5 m); may include walls, fences, hedges, woody lines, etc.; multiple parts form a single line with events.
- Events along lines carry attributes; lines are created, edited, cut, deleted, and reshaped; large features may be represented as wide linear features (polygons) if they occupy more area than minimum mappable unit.

### 6.1 New
- Create a new line with pen; minimum length 5 m; no line outside the square; one Unsurveyed/Missing Data event spans entire length.

### 6.2 Modify
- Edit line shape by moving vertices; shared nodes edited via Shared Node Modify; edits must preserve topology and avoid new intersections.

### 6.3 Cut
- Cut line along a digitised polygon; shows length cut vs remaining; edits applied after confirming.

### 6.4 Delete
- Delete line (and all its events) if it has valid Reason for Change for all events; otherwise attributes must be updated first.

### 6.5 Reshape
- Reshape line by drawing a reshape graphic; intersects line at endpoints; edits saved to alter line shape.

### 6.6 Checking Visit Status
- Use Select By Attributes to identify unvisited landscape events; filter by VISIT_STATUS; edit events as needed.

### 6.7 Attributes
- Edit line-level and event-level attributes; mandatory fields highlighted; events must be at least 5 m long.

### 6.8 Copy Attributes
- Copy events from a source line to target lines; one source, many targets; ensure attributes are reviewed after copy.

## Troubleshooting and tips
- If Table of Contents or toolbars are missing, restore via Windows customization options.
- Regularly save sessions; ensure proper log-off to prevent data loss.
