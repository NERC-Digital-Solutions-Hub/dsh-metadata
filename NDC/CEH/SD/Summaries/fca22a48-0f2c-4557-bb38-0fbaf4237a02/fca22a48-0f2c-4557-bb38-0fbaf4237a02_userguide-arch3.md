# Long-term ecology in the Dark Peak Palaeoenvironmental analyses from Bar Brook (Totley Moss), Emlin Dike (Bradfield Moors), Cranberry Bed (Upper Derwent) & Withens Moor (Glossop)

## Overview and Aims
- Establish the long-term vegetation ecology of upland moorlands in the Peak District, spanning centuries before present to inform current management.
- Investigate habitat variability, drivers of change, and cross-site comparisons to understand long-term trends.
- Inform monitoring and restoration by providing longer-term baselines for vegetation, burning, grazing, hydrology, and carbon dynamics.
- Combine palaeoecological data (pollen, spores, charcoal, soot) with radiocarbon dating and modern ecological records to assess resilience and thresholds.

## Data, Methods, and Study Sites (Dark Peak)
- Sampling: top 50 cm of peat cores collected in Oct 2008 from four sites using a modified golf-hole corer (10 cm diameter; depths up to >2 m at some sites).
- Analyses: pollen, spores, charcoal, soot (for dating and pollution proxy), radiocarbon dating for peat ages; spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) and lead-210 dating used to calibrate recent signals.
- Sites:
  - Withens Moor: deep blanket peat; record spans ~AD 800 to present.
  - Bar Brook: drier moor-top grass/heather; ~AD 650 to present.
  - Emlin Dike: moorland edge; ~AD 1590 to 2008.
  - Cranberry Bed: valley-bottom flushed mire; ~AD 1770 to present.
- Temporal scale: multiple centuries with decadal to centennial resolution; emphasis on long-term shifts rather than short-term fluctuations.

## Key Findings by Site
- Withens Moor
  - Long record (~AD 800–present): shift from heather-dominated to grass-dominated around 1870.
  - Indicators of intensified grazing, increased burning (late 17th–18th c.), and rising soot pollution from 1890s.
  - Heather recovery evident in some pollen signals in the last ~40–60 years, though grass dominance persists on deep peat.
- Bar Brook
  - ~AD 650–present: transition from mixed grass/heather to heather-dominated (1550–1870), then to grass-dominated (1880–1900), with partial recovery later; landscape shows mosaics of grazing, burning, and drainage.
  - Peak diversity occurred 1210–1610, reflecting a mix of lightly shaded, lightly grazed, and burned habitats; once grass-dominated, diversity declined unless landscape mosaic persisted.
  - Burning and grazing histories strongly tied to vegetation shifts; recent burning is comparatively lower than historical peaks.
- Emlin Dike
  - ~AD 1590–2008: alternating phases of heath-dominated, grass-dominated, and mixed grass/heath regimes.
  - Grass expansion around 1870–1890 linked to intensified grazing and a large fire; later recovery and renewed heath presence with continued grazing pressures.
  - Recent vegetation shows increasing heather presence again (last ~35–50 years) amid plantation-aged conifers on surrounding edges.
- Cranberry Bed
  - ~AD 1770–1965+ (and ongoing to present): initial dominance by heather (~1770–1880), then a shift to mixed grass/heath, followed by renewed heather dominance (1900–1960), then grass dominance (1960–1990) with a later shift back to mixed grass/heather.
  - 1940s–1960s: grasses spread with intensified grazing, burning, possible drainage, and atmospheric deposition; Sphagnum declines after 1940; later woodland expansion (oak/beech) from ~1850–1960 and maturation ~1960 onward.
  - By 1965 onward, shifts reflect continuing grazing and burning regimes plus broader landscape changes (plantations, parks) altering habitat structure.
- General Dark Peak patterns
  - Across sites, long-term data show moors have been dynamic on decadal–century scales, with grass invasion often following heavy grazing and/or intense fires.
  - Heather loss and grass expansion are widespread but not uniform; extreme events (fires, drought/desiccation, pollution) can drive rapid, large-scale change.
  - Some sites show signs of recovery in the last ~40–60 years, but degraded moors (e.g., Withens Moor) may remain more vulnerable to continued disturbance and climatic changes.
  - The historical baseline is more complex than 20th-century surveys imply; baselines limited to recent decades miss earlier, substantial shifts.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- Move beyond 20th-century baselines; incorporate multi-century paleoecological and historical evidence to understand natural variability, thresholds, and resilience.
- Use holistic, ecosystem-wide indicators (grazing, burning, hydrology, pollution) rather than single-species targets to capture complex interactions.
- Develop flexible baselines and scenario-based targets that accommodate potential regime shifts and climate changes.
- Integrate long-term records with short- and mid-term ecological monitoring to improve attribution of observed changes.
- Foster cross-disciplinary data sharing (ecology, environmental history, geochemistry, archaeology) and reduce data silos to enhance governance and decision-making.
- Emphasize transparent data provenance, metadata, and long-term stewardship; support adaptive, scenario-based monitoring design that can incorporate paleo- and socio-economic signals.

## Data Governance and Monitoring Design
- Require integrated monitoring frameworks that couple paleoecological baselines with contemporary indicators.
- Establish decision rules that distinguish acceptable natural variability from concerning thresholds, informed by long-term records.
- Encourage co-production of indicators with stakeholders to enhance relevance, legitimacy, and uptake in policy.
- Promote data sharing from source datasets and metadata curation to overcome barriers to verifying data suitability and comparability.

## Implications for Policy and Practice
- Moorland restoration is more cost-effective on sites with fewer degraded legacies; long-term data help identify which moors are most at risk of crossing irreversible thresholds.
- Management decisions should consider the role of disturbance (grazing, muirburn, drainage) and their historical context; moderate disturbance can maintain heath, while extreme fires correlate with grass-dominated states.
- Carbon dynamics in peatlands are tightly linked to vegetation regime and hydrology; changes in vegetation composition correspond to shifts in carbon accumulation rates, underscoring the need for long-term baselines in carbon budgeting.
- Data-driven policy should incorporate long-term ecological narratives to support sustainable moorland management and resilient woodland regeneration.

## NW Sutherland: Vegetation and Land-Use History (Summary)
- Regional pattern: NW Scotland shows a long history of woodland contraction and mosaic landscapes where blanket peat, mires, and open heath coexisted with limited tree cover since early post-glacial times.
- Woodland dynamics
  - Major woodland expansion occurred during a drier/warm period ~4800–4400 years ago (pine northward spread), but contraction followed within a few generations.
  - Since then, tree cover has remained relatively sparse; pine stumps across the landscape reflect historical responses to climate change rather than sustained woodlands.
  - Birch regeneration has been episodic and disturbance-dependent; exclosures show regeneration under grazing regimes, but oak pollen remains scarce, and regeneration is fragile under high grazing pressure and deer presence.
- Land-use history
  - Disturbance signals (grazing, cultivation, burning) appear from around 4300 years ago, with more explicit evidence from the Iron Age onward.
  - Medieval and later periods show intensified grazing, shifting vegetation toward grasses and heaths, with episodic birch and pine expansions, and later conifer plantation expansion since the 19th century.
  - Grazing management and burning regimes strongly shape woodland margins and heath distributions; hydrological shifts and soil stability relate to pasture development and drainage.
- Local site patterns (selected NW Sutherland sites)
  - Veyatie: birch/pasture mosaic with multiple birch growth phases; disturbance-driven regeneration; limited eastward expansion of birch.
  - Loch a’ Mhuilinn: long-term open ground with grazing-dominated regimes; birch increases linked to reduced grazing; pine plantations in surrounding areas alter habitat structure.
  - Allt na Glaic Moire: repeated cycles of heather decline and regrowth driven by grazing and burning; evidence of erosion patterns linked to climate variability and land-use changes.
  - Glenleraig and Ruigh Dorch: mosaics of agricultural exclosure, mire, and woodland; widespread changes from grazing-driven clearance to pasture and later plantation expansion; biodiversity and cultural landscape shifts tied to farming traditions and estate management.
- Implications for monitoring and regeneration
  - Disturbance and grazing continue to govern woodland regeneration; regeneration is more feasible under regulated disturbance regimes than under grazing exclusion alone.
  - Oak regeneration is limited; birch expansion may be more resilient under certain disturbance regimes, especially in sheltered sites.
  - Long-term perspectives are essential to understand regeneration pathways and to plan woodland restoration in the context of climate change and changing land-use pressures.

## Policy and Practice Implications (NW Sutherland)
- Atlantic woodlands and oak regeneration require nuanced management beyond sole emphasis on hardwood species; acknowledge mosaic dynamics and disturbance regimes.
- Woodland resilience may benefit from controlled disturbance and targeted management of grazing pressures to sustain regeneration in birch and other tolerant species.
- Future monitoring should integrate historical and paleoecological context to interpret current woodland status and project regeneration trajectories under climate and policy changes.

## Recommendations for Practitioners and Monitoring Frameworks
- Integrate long-term ecological and environmental history data into monitoring design to establish robust, ecologically relevant baselines.
- Build multi-site, cross-disciplinary monitoring programs that account for site-specific disturbance histories, hydrology, and pollution signals.
- Use scenario-based, adaptive monitoring that can accommodate non-linear dynamics and potential regime shifts in moorland and woodland ecosystems.
- Foster stakeholder engagement and knowledge exchange to translate long-term evidence into policy and management actions; support networks that bridge palaeoecology, ecology, and policy.
- Invest in data provenance, metadata standards, and shared data repositories to enable transparent data use and cross-site comparisons.
- Leverage long-term data to inform carbon accounting in peatlands and to guide restoration prioritization across upland environments.

## Uncertainties and Limitations
- Chronological uncertainties in radiocarbon dating and dating of soot-based signals; dating errors acknowledged (on the order of decades to a few decades depending on method).
- Site-specific variability means baselines from one site may not generalize to others; regional synthesis should be cautious.
- Data gaps exist for some regions and time periods; ongoing work needed to fill gaps and extend spatial and temporal coverage.
- Interactions among grazing, burning, climate, drainage, and pollution are complex; disentangling causality requires integrated, multi-proxy approaches.
