Long-term ecology in the Dark Peak Palaeoenvironmental analyses from Bar Brook (Totley Moss), Emlin Dike (Bradfield Moors), Cranberry Bed (Upper Derwent) & Withens Moor (Glossop)

## Aims and scope
- Establish long-term vegetation ecology of upland moorlands across centuries to inform current management.
- Compare multiple sites to understand variability, drivers of change, and how legacies influence present resilience.
- Complement short-term ecological datasets by providing longer-timescale baselines and trajectories for policy and restoration planning.

## Data sources and types
- Palaeoecological proxies: pollen, spores, charcoal, soot particles.
- Dating and chronology: radiocarbon dating, lead-210 dating, spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) for post-1850 signals.
- Additional measurements: bulk density, carbon and nitrogen quantification, hydrological proxies, and plant/macrofossil indicators.
- Outputs include high-resolution site-specific records of vegetation, land-use history, fire regimes, and carbon dynamics.

## Study sites and sampling
- Peak District moors: Withens Moor, Bar Brook, Emlin Dike, Cranberry Bed.
- Sampling: peat cores (~50 cm depth; 10 cm diameter) collected October 2008 from top 50 cm at each site; analysis focused on pollen, spores, charcoal, and SCPs.
- NW Sutherland sites (regional overview): Veyatie, Loch a’ Mhuilinn, Allt na Glaic Moire, Glenleraig, Ruigh Dorch (summaries cover 5000+ years of history across multiple sites).

## Methods
- Core extraction and field preservation followed by laboratory pollen identifications, charcoal analysis, and dating.
- Chronologies anchored by radiocarbon dates and SCP/210Pb data; all ages reported in calendar years AD.
- Data analysis included rarefaction for plant-diversity trends and ordination for cross-site comparisons.
- Carbon accumulation rates and hydrological inferences derived from pollen preservation and related measurements.

## Key findings: Peak District moorland dynamics
- Heather-to-grass transitions: Long-term shifts from heather-dominated to grass-dominated moorland occurred across all four sites, with notable intensification in the 19th–20th centuries.
- Drivers: A combination of grazing pressure (stocking) and burning regimes, with climatic variability and atmospheric pollution also acting as contributing factors.
- Site-specific patterns:
  - Withens Moor: Heather dominance until around 1860, then grass dominance by 1870–2008; drought and grazing linked to moss/peat changes; recovery signals visible in the last 40–60 years at some sites.
  - Bar Brook: Transition to grass-dominated moor around 1880–1900; historical mosaic of grass/heather with later shifts influenced by grazing and burning; landscape-scale tree planting offset local losses.
  - Emlin Dike: Three-phase trajectory—heather dominance (c.1570–1880), grass-dominance (c.1880–1950), then mixed grass/heather (c.1955–2008); major influence from grazing, with possible fire-driven openings facilitating grass spread.
  - Cranberry Bed: Transition from heather-dominated to grass-dominated around mid-20th century; earlier history shows shifts between grass/heather and vascular plant diversity; plantations and parkland establishment (1850–1960) increased woodland cover, altering site dynamics.
- Recovery and thresholds: Three of four Peak District sites show heath recovery in the last 40–60 years, suggesting that unprecedented extremes in recent history do not automatically imply irreversible thresholds; however, degraded sites (e.g., Withens Moor) may have crossed thresholds making restoration more challenging.

## Data management and outputs
- Data storage: password-protected, networked drive; ongoing archiving and off-site backups.
- Outputs: site reports, peer-reviewed publications, and case-study datasets; online reports available for Project 2 (Peak District) and Project 3 (NW Sutherland).
- Data products for practice: long-term baselines, high-resolution pollen/habitat change records, and cross-site comparatives to inform baseline setting and restoration planning.

## Implications for policy, management, and practice
- Long-term baselines improve understanding of variability and resilience, reducing risk of misinformed management based on short-term data.
- Restoration planning: feasibility is higher on less degraded moors; chronic degradation may require more intensive or targeted interventions.
- Disturbance regime guidance: Moderate grazing and disturbance may sustain heath mosaics, while extreme fires correlate with grass-dominated shifts.
- Integration of long-term data: bridging environmental history with current policy requires stakeholder engagement and adaptable governance frameworks.

## Data products, dashboards, and use for Data Support
- Longitudinal baselines and site-specific pollen/vegetation trajectories across moors provide robust data products for self-service analyses.
- Cross-site syntheses enable rapid benchmarking of current moorland condition against centuries of change.
- Data gaps include higher-resolution, landscape-scale carbon dynamics and integration with socio-economic histories to model policy outcomes.

## NW Sutherland: regional vegetation history and land-use
- Broad regional context: early post-glacial woodland dynamics with intermittent pine expansion 4800–4400 years ago, followed by contractions; blanket peat development and openness of landscapes persisted alongside scattered woodlands.
- Woodland dynamics: multiple phases of contraction and limited regeneration, with birch/Oak dynamics strongly tied to disturbance, grazing, and climate, rather than simple expansion.
- Climate signals and management: Little Ice Age impacts inferred but hard to separate from grazing; evidence suggests grazing and disturbance have been primary drivers of woodland changes in the last 2000+ years.
- Landscape synthesis: at finer scales, woodland regeneration appears sensitive to disturbance regimes; birch regeneration benefited from breaks in heather cover and certain disturbance patterns, but overall woodland expansion remains limited in peat-rich uplands.
- Management implications: sustaining birch and other tree species may require controlled disturbance regimes; regional woodland restoration should balance ecological values with cultural-landscape heritage.

## Stakeholder engagement and interdisciplinarity
- Environmental history (long-term ecological data) combined with social science methods (stakeholder interviews, choice experiments) to evaluate how long-term evidence informs decision-making.
- Case-study sites selected with local stakeholder input; dissemination targeted to policymakers, land managers, and local communities.
- Networks and partnerships (e.g., Bridging the Gap) used to translate long-term insights into practical guidance and to foster local adaptive capacity.

## Future directions and data priorities
- Address infrastructural barriers to integrating long-term data into decision-making frameworks.
- Expand cross-disciplinary collaboration to embed long-term evidence within policy and management practice.
- Continue developing and sharing data products that facilitate end-user interpretation and uptake by managers, policy advisers, and stakeholders.
- Extend high-resolution long-term records to additional upland regions to strengthen baselines and resilience indicators.

## Outputs and knowledge transfer
- Publications, newsletters, and conference outputs disseminating long-term ecological insights.
- Case-study reports and online datasets to support future management decisions.
- Capacity-building activities including training of students and involvement in applied projects to widen the use of palaeoecological data in upland management.
