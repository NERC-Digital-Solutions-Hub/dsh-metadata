# Long-term ecology in the Dark Peak Palaeoenvironmental analyses from Bar Brook (Totley Moss), Emlin Dike (Bradfield Moors), Cranberry Bed (Upper Derwent) & Withens Moor (Glossop)

- Overview
  - Investigates long-term vegetation history and land-use changes in UK uplands using palaeoecological methods to inform contemporary management and policy.
  - Combines environmental archaeology/history with social science to translate long-term evidence into decision-making tools.
  - Emphasises multi-century to millennial timescales to understand variability, resilience, and restoration potential.

- Aims and approach
  - Establish long-term vegetation ecology (centuries to millennia) and the relationships between people and landscapes.
  - Assess habitat variability and drivers of change over time to support informed management decisions.
  - Develop a communication framework that integrates long-term evidence with policy, monitoring, and stakeholder perspectives.

- Methods and data sources
  - Palaeoecology: peat cores (50 cm, 10 cm diameter), pollen, spores, charcoal, soot particles; radiocarbon dating; lead-210 dating where applicable; spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) for pollution history.
  - Analyses: rarefaction for plant diversity, ordination for inter-site comparisons; hydrological and carbon accumulation indicators from pollen density and bulk analyses.
  - Chronologies: radiocarbon dating plus SCPs/lead-210 for calibration; typical dating uncertainties acknowledged (± decades to a few decades depending on evidence).
  - Site network: four Peak District moorland sites (Withens Moor, Bar Brook, Emlin Dike, Cranberry Bed) and NW Sutherland case-study sites for cross-regional comparison.

- Key findings by theme
  - Moorland management & dynamics: long-term shifts from heather-dominated to grass-dominated moorlands linked to grazing pressure, burning regimes, and climate/pollution interactions; 20th-century baselines often do not capture earlier variability or potential regime shifts.
  - Degraded lands & thresholds of stability: peatlands and moorlands show erosion, hydrological changes, and pollutant storage; recovery is uncertain due to complex feedbacks; restoration targets require integrating hydrology, carbon dynamics, and multi-scale data.
  - Upland diversity – legacy & management: biodiversity declines exceed recent baselines; abandonment is not a simple remedy; mosaics of land-use history (grazing, burning, pollution) shape current diversity; managed disturbance and mosaic landscapes often support biodiversity and livelihoods.
  - Resilience & restoration management: restoration must account for past legacies and potential future climate shifts; targets should reflect long-term hydrology and soil/peat development; gradual, scenario-based planning is essential.
  - Climatic & economic change – rural risk & resilience: climate change interacts with economic incentives; diversification and flexible, locally adapted strategies are preferable to static production models; cross-disciplinary collaboration is needed to link local production with policy outcomes.

- Peak District moorland case studies (highlights)
  - Withens Moor: long-term transition from heather-dominant to grass-dominated moor; grazing-intensive periods and increased burning coincide with significant ecological shifts; 1870s onward, grassland becomes dominant with rising pollution signals; some evidence of heath recovery in recent decades.
  - Bar Brook: shifts from mixed grass/heather (650–1480) to heather-dominant (c. 1750–1880) then grass-dominant (c. 1900–1985); landscape-scale changes reflect grazing, burning, drainage, and plantation expansion.
  - Emlin Dike: three phases—heather-dominant (c. 1570–1880), grass-dominant (c. 1885–1950), mixed grass/heather (c. 1955–2008); burning and grazing dynamics, including potential grouse management influences, shaped canopy openness and grass spread.
  - Cranberry Bed: transitions from heather-dominated (c. 1770–1880) to mixed grass/heather (c. 1880–1900) to heather-dominated (c. 1900–1960) to grass-dominated (c. 1960–1990) with later mixed phases; forestry and plantation establishment from mid-19th to mid-20th centuries altered site structure and species balance.
  - General Peak District implication: unprecedented recent extremes in vegetation history; recovery appears possible on some less-degraded moors, but others remain vulnerable; restoration is more cost-effective on less degraded sites.

- NW Sutherland – vegetation history and woodland dynamics
  - Regional pattern: after deglaciation, an open mosaic persisted with pine near recolonization limits; blanket peat expansion and widespread now-limited woodland contractions occurred around 4400 years ago; woodland dynamics show episodic birch and pine fluctuations with limited long-term oak pollen signals.
  - Woodland distribution and regeneration: forests historically fragmented; regeneration is often grazing- and disturbance-driven rather than solely climate-driven; oak pollen remains low despite presumed historic presence, indicating regeneration challenges.
  - Site-level dynamics (selected):
    - Veyatie: birch expansion phases around 1640–1730 and 1890–1910, with later activity into the 20th century; disturbance and grazing influence seedling establishment; birch growth may respond to breaks in heather dominance and grazing patterns.
    - Loch a’ Mhuilinn: 500-year pollen record shows open, grazed grass-dominated conditions 1580–1820, followed by increased birch cover to the present; oak pollen scarce; disturbance and management shape regeneration.
    - Allt na Glaic Moire: multiple phases of heather decline and regrowth linked to grazing and burning; birch loss during 1740–1790; later shifts reflect changing cattle/ sheep regimes and increasing conifer plantations.
    - Glenleraig & Ruigh Dorch: 5,500-year record at Ruigh Dorch; 2,050-year record at Glenleraig; early dominance by alder/birch with later shifts to grasslands; grazing, burning, cultivation, and later forestry shaped mosaic landscapes; woodlands declined in the 16th–19th centuries with later regional conifer expansion and birch resurgence in some periods.
  - Implications for management: long-term data underscore that woodland expansion is limited by soil type (mineral soils more favorable for trees than blanket peat); disturbance (grazing/burn) appears crucial for regeneration; current oak-focused habitat definitions may overlook broader woodland resilience and regeneration dynamics.

- Data, implications and policy relevance
  - Long-term baselines reveal greater ecological change and vulnerability than short-term surveys capture; baselines anchored to millennial-scale history may be more robust than mid-20th-century norms.
  - Policy and management should integrate paleoecological context to set realistic restoration targets, recognizing potential regime shifts and the role of historical land-use legacies.
  - The research demonstrates the value of combining environmental history with palaeoecology to inform practical management decisions, while highlighting barriers to integrating long-term data into policy frameworks.

- Data, gaps, and recommendations
  - Need for multi-site, high-resolution data linking palaeo records with contemporary monitoring to improve cross-scale understanding.
  - Develop integrated models coupling hydrology, vegetation, carbon dynamics, and climate across landscapes.
  - Expand datasets to include fauna alongside flora for holistic ecosystem responses.
  - Foster cross-disciplinary collaboration among ecologists, historians, policymakers, and local land managers to co-produce applicable baselines and targets.
  - Promote mechanisms for incorporating long-term evidence into policy discussions and restoration planning beyond traditional ecological metrics.

- Case study outputs and capacities
  - Case-study reports and a range of peer-reviewed publications; data management and archiving planned to ensure discoverability and reuse.
  - Engagement with stakeholders and policy researchers to translate long-term insights into decision-making tools, including interviews and choice experiments to evaluate the value of long-term data.
  - Training and capacity-building for students and researchers in palynology, environmental archaeology, and interdisciplinary research methods to support ongoing application of long-term evidence.

- Concluding perspective
  - Long-term ecological perspectives, when integrated with social science and stakeholder engagement, provide valuable context for managing upland ecosystems under climate and policy change.
  - A flexible, place-based approach that accounts for historic legacies and regional variability is essential for resilient upland management and conservation planning.
