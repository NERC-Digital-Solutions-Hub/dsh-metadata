# Long-term ecology in the Dark Peak Palaeoenvironmental analyses from Bar Brook (Totley Moss), Emlin Dike (Bradfield Moors), Cranberry Bed (Upper Derwent) & Withens Moor (Glossop)

## Overview
- A palaeoenvironmental study of upland moorlands in the Peak District and NW Scotland, covering centuries before present.
- Aims to understand vegetation history, variability, and drivers of change to inform current management with long-term trends in vegetation, diversity, burning, and land-use.
- Emphasises integrating environmental archaeology with GIS-relevant data to support resilient moorland management.

## Study sites and sampling
- Four peat-based study sites sampled in October 2008 using 50 cm peat cores:
  - Withens Moor: deep blanket peat; top 50 cm sampled to study grass expansion and grass/heather dynamics.
  - Bar Brook: minerogenic peat in an infilled Bar Brook channel; top 50 cm sampled; record of prehistoric land-use and vegetation.
  - Emlin Dike: edge of Bradfield Moors; peat depth varies; aims to capture vegetation change near moorland edge.
  - Cranberry Bed: valley-bottom flushed mire; up to 4.1 m peat depth in the valley; top 50 cm sampled.
- Analyses included pollen, spores, charcoal, soot particles (dating since 1850), and radiocarbon dating to establish chronology.

## Vegetation and land-use histories (site highlights)
- Withens Moor
  - 800–present: shift from heather-dominated to grass-dominated (grassmoor) around 1870.
  - 1690–1760: intensified grazing and burning; charcoal and soot indicate past fires and industrial pollution around 1890.
  - 1870–1930: peak grazing indicators; grass spread; moss decline linked to drought/pressure; some recovery in last 40–60 years at a few indicators.
  - Pollen diversity increases from ~1870, reflecting disturbance-driven mosaics; grazing and drainage patterns influence heterogeneity.

- Bar Brook
  - 650–1985: transition from mixed grass/heather (c.650–1480) to heather-dominated (c.1750–1880) to grass-dominated (c.1900–1985), with mosaic phases around 1975–2008.
  - Long-term decline in species richness during heather-dominated phase; burning and grazing shifts correlated with vegetation changes.
  - Landscape-scale offset from plantations that buffered local losses.

- Emlin Dike
  - 1570–2008: three phases—heather-dominant (c.1570–1880), shift to grass-dominant (c.1880–1950), then mixed grass/heather (c.1955–2008).
  - Increased grazing and burning around 1870–1890 associated with grass spread; large fire and grazing likely opened canopies enabling grasses.
  - Since 1960s, tree pollen rises due to conifer/estate plantings; heath still present with diverse sward.

- Cranberry Bed
  - 1770–present: history of shifts between heather-dominated and mixed grass/heath mosaics.
  - 1770–1880: gradual loss of heather with intensified grazing and burning; more diversity; oak/beech/planted woodland increase later.
  - 1880–1900: grasses expand at expense of heather; 1940–1965: further diversity loss with peak burning (1950–1965) and possible sulphur deposition effects; post-1960s woodland expansion alters habitat mosaic.
  - Since mid-20th century, balance shifts and partial heather recovery observed with reduced burning in recent decades.

## Moorland dynamics across Peak District (regional patterns)
- Open moorland has dominated for ~2000 years; peat formation began long before.
- Over the last ~3500–500 years, many moors shifted from heather-dominated to grass-dominated; grazing intensity and burning are primary drivers, with drainage, pollution, and climate also influential.
- Some sites show signs of heath recovery in the last ~40–60 years; others remain heavily degraded, indicating thresholds and variability in resilience.
- Findings emphasize that historic baselines extend beyond modern ecological surveys; late-20th-century baselines may underestimate past change.

## NW Sutherland – regional patterns and woodland history
- Regional pattern: woodland contraction and fragmentation over the last few millennia, with episodic birch/pine dynamics and limited long-term expansions.
- Pine expansion occurred around 4800–4400 years ago but was short-lived; current pine plantations reflect modern management rather than natural expansion.
- Birch regrowth and regeneration depend on disturbance (grazing, fire) and are not simply suppressed by grazing exclusion; some birch expansion occurred with moderate disturbance.
- Oak pollen is scarce, complicating assessment of historic oak regeneration; woodland fragmentation persists due to climate fluctuations and anthropogenic disturbance.

## Site-specific NW Scotland case studies (highlights)
- Veyatie (Loch Veyatie area)
  - Birch edges fluctuated with disturbance; three birch-growth phases (1640–1730, 1890–1910, post-1980) tied to grazing and burning patterns.
  - Birch regeneration appears linked to disturbance rather than simple grazing exclusion.
- Loch a’Mhuilinn
  - 500-year pollen record shows two main phases: grazed grass/peat 1580–1820; birch expansion 1820–present; oak pollen scarce.
  - Birch growth tied to disturbance and management; modern conifer plantations (around 1980) influence pollen signals.
- Glenleraig & Ruigh Dorch
  - Mosaic of pastures, damp grassy habitats, and varying levels of woodland; significant grazing-driven changes since the 16th century.
  - 19th-century conifer plantation expansion; later birch regeneration with reduced grazing; biodiversity and cultural landscape implications.
- Allt na Glaic Moire
  - Heather-dominated with multi-phase declines corresponding to grazing and burning regimes (1580–1650, 1710–1810, 1810–1840, 1840–1965).
  - Subsequent birch regeneration and shifts toward grasses; role of grazing and burning continues to shape heather/grass balance.

## Methods and data types
- High-resolution palaeoecology: peat cores (50 cm), pollen, spores, charcoal, soot particles; dating via radiocarbon and soot particle chronology (post-1850), with 210Pb where applicable.
- Data analysis: rarefaction for plant diversity, ordination for inter-site comparisons; carbon accumulation and hydrological proxies inferred from pollen, density, and composition.
- Chronologies provide decadal to centennial-scale insight, often with dating uncertainties of several decades to a century.
- Social science and stakeholder engagement complemented the ecological data (Projects 2–4) to assess the value and applicability of long-term data in decision-making.

## GIS and data products implications
- Create long-term, multi-temporal geospatial layers of moorland vegetation regimes (heather vs grass) across centuries.
- Map proxies for disturbance regimes:
  - Grazing intensity proxies (grazing-associated pollen indicators, dung-associated spores).
  - Burning history (charcoal layers, soot SCPs).
  - Drainage and hydrology changes (erosion records, sedimentation timing, peat desiccation signals).
- Track vegetation transitions and thresholds to identify vulnerable moorlands and potential recovery trajectories.
- Incorporate pollution proxies (soot SCPs, heavy-metal indicators) to assess climate/pollution interactions with vegetation and carbon storage.
- Integrate peat carbon balance indicators (peat depth, vegetation type, surface structure) with climate scenarios.
- Map woodland dynamics and restoration potential (birch/pine regeneration, oak pollen signals, extent of conifer plantations).
- Align pollen-based chronologies with management history and policy timelines to support baselines and scenario planning.

## General conclusions for GIS practice
- Baselines from recent decades may understate long-term change; GIS products should incorporate millennial to centennial-scale context.
- Moorland management targets may need to account for historical variability and potential novel stable states beyond past conditions.
- Disturbance-driven regeneration (disturbance regimes as a key driver) should be represented in restoration planning layers.
- Long-term ecological signals (pollen, SCPs, radiocarbon dates) provide robust reference points for policy and management decision-making beyond short-term monitoring.

## Knowledge transfer and policy relevance
- Long-term data enhance understanding of resilience and thresholds, informing moorland monitoring baselines and restoration planning.
- Stakeholder engagement indicates value in long-term ecology for decision-making, but institutional barriers require cross-disciplinary collaboration and policy-level adoption.
- The project demonstrates how palaeoecology, when combined with social science, can influence practical management and policy discussions about upland ecosystems.

## Case study highlights (summary bullets)
- Peak District: unprecedented shifts from heather to grass, with some heath recovery in recent decades; extreme fires and grazing intensification strongly associated with vegetation transitions.
- NW Sutherland: long-term woodland contraction, birch/pine dynamics, and complex interactions between grazing, burning, and climate; birch regeneration often requires disturbance.
- Carbon dynamics: vegetation shifts influence peatland carbon accumulation; strong coupling between hydrology, vegetation, and carbon storage needs further study.

## Future directions and recommendations
- Integrate long-term ecological data more fully into decision-making frameworks; foster policy-science partnerships to extend horizon-scanning and baselines.
- Expand site networks and chronology resolution to improve regional comparability and scale-sensitive management.
- Develop GIS-ready, user-friendly datasets that combine palaeoecological evidence with contemporary land-use data for robust restoration planning and policy support.
