# Long-term ecology in the Dark Peak Palaeoenvironmental analyses from Bar Brook (Totley Moss), Emlin Dike (Bradfield Moors), Cranberry Bed (Upper Derwent) & Withens Moor (Glossop)

## Purpose and scope
- Establish long-term vegetation ecology of Peak District moorlands for centuries up to the present.
- Identify habitat variability and drivers of change over time, in comparison with other records.
- Inform current management with long-term trends in vegetation cover, plant diversity, and burning, to complement existing short-term datasets.

## Sampling sites and methods
- Four peat-based study sites:
  - Withens Moor: deep blanket peat; top 50 cm sampled to investigate grass spread and drivers.
  - Bar Brook: minerogenic peat in an intact channel; top 50 cm sampled; historical land-use signals and burning/grazing evaluated.
  - Emlin Dike: varied peat depths; edge-of-m Moor record with potential to preserve vegetation change near moorland edge.
  - Cranberry Bed: valley-bottom flushed mire behind landslip; top 50 cm sampled to compare valley-bottom vs upland dynamics.
- Field and lab methods (Oct 2008 sampling):
  - Peat cores (10 cm diameter; 50 cm depth).
  - Analyses for pollen, spores, charcoal, and soot particles (as a dating proxy for post-1850 changes and pollution history).
  - Radiocarbon dating to establish ages; soot particles used to date peat since 1850.
- Chronologies and data treatment:
  - Chronologies anchored by radiocarbon dates and SCP/lead-210 dating where applicable.
  - Pollen diversity quantified with rarefaction; inter-site comparisons via ordination.

## Vegetation history and land-use patterns by site
- Withens Moor (c. AD 800–present):
  - Long dominance shifts: heather (AD 800–1900) then grass-dominated (post-1870s).
  - Intensified grazing and burning from late 17th to 18th centuries; grass expansion linked to grazing pressure and burning; soot from fossil fuel pollution correlated with grass spread from around 1890.
  - Increasing pollen diversity from around 1870; grazing signals exhibit rise/fall over time; burning generally reduced after 1930.
- Bar Brook (c. AD 650–present):
  - Transition from heather-dominated moor to grass-dominated by late 19th–early 20th century; grazing intensification and drainage implicated.
  - Peak diversity occurs during mosaic phases (lightly shaded, grazed, burnt) between 1210 and 1610; later marked grass dominance reduces diversity.
  - Later periods show recovery signals as grazing pressures and burning fluctuate.
- Emlin Dike (c. AD 1590–2008):
  - Three phases: heather-dominated (1590–1880), grass-dominated (1880–1950), then mixed grass/heather (1955–2008).
  - Grass expansion strongly tied to disturbance (grazing and a large/ intense fire around 1870); mid-20th century trend shows renewed heather and diversity.
  - Conifer plantation pollen increases from the mid-20th century reflecting landscape change.
- Cranberry Bed (c. AD 1770–present):
  - From 1770–1880: heather declines with grasses increasing; higher grazing and burning intensities.
  - 1880–1900: shift toward grassy heaths; woodland expansion around 1850–1900 and maturation since 1960.
  - 1940–1965: grasses spread, diversity declines; potential sulfur deposition effects; post-1965 shifts show partial re-expansion of heather with reduced burning.
- Across sites, long-term data show:
  - Historical heather declines began well before the 20th century; grass invasion a pervasive outcome across the Peak District.
  - No single driver; complex interactions among grazing, burning, drainage, climate, and atmospheric pollution.
  - Some sites show signs of heath recovery in the last 40–60 years, but overall vulnerability remains, especially on degraded moors.

## Moorland dynamics and regional context
- Long-term trend: open moorland and peat have persisted for millennia; widespread shifts from heather to grass dominate the last 200–300 years.
- Historical drivers:
  - Management changes (sheep grazing intensity, muirburn), drainage, and landscape fragmentation strongly shape vegetation mosaics.
  - Climate fluctuations (including potential Little Ice Age impacts) interact with disturbance regimes.
  - Atmospheric pollution (soot/ sulphur) linked to fire history and peat dynamics.
- Key implication: baselines based on recent decades may underrepresent historical variability and resilience; decadal–century timescales are essential to understand thresholds and potential recovery.

## Data, analysis, and indicators
- Data types:
  - Pollen and plant macrofossils; charcoal and soot particles; radiocarbon dating; SCPs and 210Pb dating for accurate chronology.
  - Hydrology and carbon accumulation inferred from pollen preservation and peat characteristics.
- Analytical approaches:
  - Rarefaction to assess plant diversity over time; ordination for cross-site comparisons.
  - Chronologies built from multiple dating methods to anchor long-term changes.
- Outputs include site-specific vegetation histories, dating tables, and contextual comparisons with broader UK upland records.

## Implications for monitoring, policy, and practice
- Baselines and targets:
  - Long-term records reveal widespread decline of heather and subsequent grass-dominated states extending beyond 20th-century baselines.
  - Policy baselines must incorporate decadal–century-scale variability and site-specific disturbance histories.
- Management and restoration:
  - Restoration is more feasible on less degraded moors; mid- to late-20th-century grazing regimes and burning patterns have lasting legacies.
  - Disturbance regimes (grazing, burning) require managed, not blanket exclusion, approaches to sustain heathland mosaics.
- Monitoring integration:
  - Long-term palaeoecological data enrich contemporary monitoring by providing robust reference conditions and clarifying drivers of change.
  - Combining historic datasets with current datasets improves predictions of ecosystem trajectories under climate and policy changes.
- Stakeholder engagement and knowledge transfer:
  - Demonstrates value of long-term evidence to inform decision-making; emphasizes need for effective communication with land managers, policymakers, and communities.
  - Use of long-term narratives helps align policy goals with ecosystem dynamics across timescales.

## Policy-relevant outcomes and engagement
- Choice experiments (Project 4) indicate long-term data are valued by residents and ecological professionals when presented alongside familiar evidence; collaboration and stakeholder engagement are crucial to apply long-term insights in governance.
- identified barriers to uptake include institutional targets and the need for better integration within decision-making frameworks; local-to-policy liaison is essential.

## Data management and dissemination
- Data storage and archiving:
  - Data stored on password-protected university networks; ongoing off-site backups; final archiving planned.
- Outputs and accessibility:
  - Case-study reports and publications available online; materials prepared to support wider use by managers and researchers.

## NW Sutherland: broader regional context (summary)
- Long-term patterns show woodland dynamics driven by climate and land-use pressures; pine expansions in earlier millennia were brief and followed by contractions.
- Birch and alder fluctuations reflect disturbance and grazing; woodland tends to contract on blanket peat and expand on mineral soils where disturbance decreases.
- Woodland regeneration is grazing-sensitive; exclosures show potential but require disturbance management to sustain regeneration.
- Regional climate history (including the Little Ice Age) interacts with grazing regimes to shape regeneration patterns; current regeneration may depend on managed disturbance and landscape context.
- Implications for upland restoration emphasize mosaics and disturbance-driven regeneration rather than simple exclusion.

## Capacity, dissemination, and future priorities
- Training and capacity-building across palaeoecology, ecology, and policy integration.
- Emphasis on bridging long-term ecological data with decision-making through networks and stakeholder engagement (e.g., Bridging the Gap).
- Future priorities include overcoming infrastructural barriers to uptake, expanding multi-site long-term datasets, and continuing cross-disciplinary collaboration to embed long-term perspectives in upland management.

## Takeaways for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Long-term ecological data provide essential context to interpret recent changes and to set more robust, adaptable baselines for policy and management.
- Data richness (pollen, charcoal, SCPs, radiocarbon dating) enables nuanced understanding of drivers (grazing, burning, drainage, climate, pollution) and their interactions over centuries.
- Integrating long-term paleoecology with contemporary monitoring enhances resilience planning and informs restoration targets, but requires deliberate efforts for data accessibility, stakeholder engagement, and alignment with existing policy frameworks.
