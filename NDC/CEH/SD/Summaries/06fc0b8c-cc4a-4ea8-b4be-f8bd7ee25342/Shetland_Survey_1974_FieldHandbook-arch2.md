# HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS VEGETATION SURVEY OF SHETLAND

## Purpose and scope
- Explains the summer vegetation survey in Shetland: purpose, rationale, and detailed field methods.
- Aims to provide standardized, repeatable data for assessing environmental health and policy-relevant changes over time.
- Data collection supports subsequent multivariate analyses (e.g., ordination) and the development of environmental models.

## Study area and motivation
- Shetland: ~550 square miles with diverse geology, climate, and topography; many inhabited islands and sensitive coastal/peatland habitats.
- Context: potential offshore oil development will bring infrastructural change that may impact geology, landscape, wildlife, and traditional livelihoods.
- Objective: establish baseline wildlife and habitat information, identify data gaps, and create datasets suitable for integration with other information sources.

## Sampling design and plot setup
- Plot selection: randomly distributed sampling points to avoid field bias; plots serve as sampling units for vegetation, soils, and habitats.
- Sampling unit: a 200 m quadrat centered on a fixed point, with five nested quadrats for detailed inside-plot sampling.
  - Center point with orientation aids (bolt cross; cords to delineate diagonals).
  - Nested quadrats: 4 m, 25 m, 50 m, 100 m, and 200 m radii (concentric within the 200 m plot).
- Plot location procedure to ensure objectivity
  - Identify a recognizable landscape feature near the plot as a ground control point.
  - Use a map and Silva compass to take two bearings to the plot, adjust for magnetic declination, and pace out the distance.
  - If using aerial photographs, locate the area on the photo and navigate to the plot using ground features.
- Bias minimization: strict adherence to ground-based bearing and pacing, with documented allowances for slope and pace variation.

## Locating and recording data in the plot
- Ground setup
  - Center post oriented by spinning a cross, then fixed with a wing-nut.
  - Corner posts connected to the center with cords to form a fixed, visible framework for the five nested quadrats.
  - Centroid-based anchoring ensures precise, repeatable quadrat geometry.
- Quadrat layout and sampling units
  - Five quadrats, nested within the 200 m plot, provide scales of 4 m, 25 m, 50 m, 100 m, and 200 m.
  - Cords and diagonals help ensure accurate subdivision and orientation.

## Vegetation data collection (ground flora)
- Procedure
  - Start inside the smallest 4 m quadrat; record plants not yet observed in inner quadrats.
  - For each plant, estimate percent cover to the nearest 5% and record presence in the appropriate quadrat.
  - Collect unidentified plants (or uncertain identifications) in labelled bags for later verification.
  - Ignore bryophytes growing on rocks or other non-soil substrates; record bryophytes present on soil only.
- Coverage and data sheets
  - Complete cover-abundance data for all species across all quadrats, with estimates averaged if two people provide estimates.
  - Record additional cover-abundance data for non-plant categories (rock, bare ground, litter, bryophytes) at the bottom of the sheet.
- Soil description within the plot
  - Expose a soil profile at the exact plot center using a spade and auger cores.
  - Record a standardized set of soil attributes (organic layer, litter, mineral horizons, color, texture, moisture, decomposition, etc.) across defined depth ranges.
  - If a particular layer is absent, mark it as such.

## Habitat and ecological context data
- Plot habitat sheet
  - Record stratification and plot number; measure slope (with a clinometer) and aspect (bearing) along the slope.
  - Classify habitats and microhabitats within the plot (e.g., dense heather, grassland, Sphagnum tussocks, moss, epiphytic lichens, aquatic bryophytes, macrofungi).
  - Document presence of microhabitats and key features (e.g., rock outcrops, scree, stream beds, standing water) and signs of grazing or trampling.
  - Note management attributes (fences, drainage lines, tracks, buildings, rubbish, burning, peat extractive activities).
- Habitats within 50 m of plot edge
  - Similar data collection as the plot habitat sheet but focused on features lying outside the plot up to 50 m away, which may influence the plot’s conditions.
- 50 m area habitats (extended context)
  - Parallel data collection framework for larger-scale habitat assessment and land-use context.
  - Includes additional categories for land use and landforms (improved grazing, arable land, peat, dunes, saltmarsh, etc.) and indicators of management or disturbance.

## Aquatic, coastal, and animal indicators
- Aquatic habitats
  - Record water bodies and their bed types (muddy bottom, rocky bottom, sandy bottom, etc.), as well as flowing vs. standing water, marshes, and seepage.
  - Include classifications for trends in streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and related aquatic features.
- Animals and grazing indicators
  - Document presence of livestock (e.g., sheep, ponies) and signs such as droppings, grazing intensity, and animal trails.
  - Note evidence of habitat use (crofts, enclosures, buildings) and signs of disturbance (burning, rubbish, tracks).
- Management and disturbance
  - Record infrastructure and disturbance factors (fences, drains, peat extraction, roads, midden, quarries, burning) and their status (in use, ruined).

## Data management, outputs, and interpretation
- Documentation
  - Completed field sheets (vegetation, soil, plot habitats, 50 m area habitats) are used to produce a general picture of vegetation structure and soil properties.
  - Example field sheets illustrate typical data collection outcomes and serve as training references.
- Analytical goals
  - Data collected enable multivariate analyses (ordination) to establish variation ranges in Shetland vegetation.
  - Data provide inputs for developing mathematical models predicting environmental responses to factors (e.g., development scenarios).
- Data handling and storage
  - Outputs are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals; datasets are prepared for broader accessibility to support environmental monitoring and policy scrutiny.

## Practical considerations and safety
- Plot viability
  - Some plots may be unsuitable (dangerous cliffs, bogs, cultivated land); procedures allow skipping or seeking permission when necessary.
- Accessibility
  - Fieldwork may involve camping or remote island travel; logistics are planned to minimize bias and maintain data integrity.
- Readiness and finishing touches
  - Ensure all three sheets are fully completed, soil samples collected, unidentified plant material bagged and labeled, and all materials packed for the next plot.

## Summary of key outputs for environmental monitoring
- Standardized, repeatable methods for vegetation, soil, and habitat assessment across Shetland.
- A framework for integrating ground flora, soil horizons, and habitat context into broader environmental monitoring programs.
- A data pipeline from field collection to multivariate analysis and predictive modeling, with explicit attention to data accessibility and inter-comparability for policy evaluation and environmental health oversight.
