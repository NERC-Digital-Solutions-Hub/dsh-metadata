# VEGETATION SURVEY OF SHETLAND HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Aimed at standardising methods for surveying vegetation and related environments in Shetland to support broader environmental planning and modeling.
- Documents the rationale, sampling design, field procedures, data capture formats, and intended analyses.

## Context and Purpose

- Shetland comprises diverse geology, climate, and landscapes, with interest in how offshore oil development could affect natural features.
- The survey targets terrestrial vegetation, freshwater and littoral habitats, sea-bird populations, and will inform models predicting environmental responses under development scenarios.
- Data will feed multivariate analyses (e.g., ordination) and the development of mathematical models of Shetland’s environment.

## Study Design and Sampling

- Randomly distributed sampling points are selected as the basis for field plots.
- Basic sampling unit is a 200 m quadrat, with five nested quadrats inside it:
  - 4 m quadrat (core ground flora recording)
  - 25 m quadrat
  - 50 m quadrat
  - 100 m quadrat
  - 200 m quadrat
- Within each nested quadrat, vegetation data are recorded, with a focus on presence, cover, and habitat context.

## Plot Location and Setup

- Plot location is done to avoid subjective bias:
  - Use easily identifiable landscape features near the plot.
  - In the field, determine a control point, then use map/bearing data with a Silva compass to locate the plot (adjust for magnetic declination).
  - Measure ground distance from the control point and pace out the distance to place the plot centre.
  - If slopes are steep or access unsafe, plots may be omitted; aerial photographs at 1:10,000 scale may be used if available.
- The method emphasizes random ground placement to ensure unbiased sampling, with contingencies for access and safety.

## Data Collection Protocols

- Ground Flora Recording
  - Start in the smallest quadrat (4 m), recording bryophytes and macrolichens on the ground only.
  - Move to 25 m, then 50 m, 100 m, and 200 m quadrats, recording only species not already observed in inner quadrats.
  - Estimate percent cover for each species to the nearest 1% and record all species across quadrats; compute overall plot cover-abundance values.
  - Exclude bryophytes/lichens growing on non-ground substrates (e.g., epiphytic on trees/rock) from ground flora counts.
- Soil Description
  - One central soil profile is described using a predesigned sheet and a soil auger to sample horizons.
  - Record horizons, depth, color, decomposition, texture, moisture, and presence/absence of litter and organic layers.
  - If peat or organic layers are present, describe their depth and characteristics; if absent, delete those sections.
- Habitat Data
  - Plot Habitat Sheet: records slope, aspect, and a wide range of habitat features at the plot, including rocky habitats, vegetation types, aquatic features, and microhabitats.
  - Habitats Within 50 m Edge Sheet: records features just outside the plot up to 50 m that may influence the plot (e.g., management, grazing, presence of structures).
  - Features cover rock outcrops, scree, soil erosion, dense vegetation (e.g., heather, grasslands), aquatic bryophytes, lichens, macrofungi, epiphytic lichens, aquatic vegetation, and various biotic/mangament indicators.
  - Management and human influence: ploughing, fencing, drainage, rubbish, tracks, crofts, buildings, peat digging, burning, etc.
  - 50 m area habitat data extend the same categories to the surrounding zone to capture edge effects.
- 50 m Area Habitats (Aquatic and Animal Data)
  - Similar to plot habitats but focused on a 50 m zone with aquatic habitats, animals, grazing indicators, and land-use types.
  - Includes notes on grazing intensity, presence of livestock, signs of grazing, droppings, and management structures.
- Data Recording and Coding
  - Data sheets include preformatted codes for habitat types, microhabitats, aquatic classes, animals, and land-use.
  - Completed examples illustrate how to fill the sheets and associating species/habitat data with plot and sub-plot numbers.

## Data Products and Analysis Pipeline

- Field data collected on multiple sheets (ground flora, soil, plot habitats, edge habitats, aquatic habitats, animals, management, land use) into standardized data sets.
- After fieldwork, data are analyzed with multivariate techniques (e.g., ordination) to determine variation in Shetland vegetation and to parameterize predictive models of the environment under different development scenarios.
- Example completed sheets provide reference datasets for new field teams.

## Practical Considerations and Challenges

- Geographic and logistical challenges: remote islands, difficult terrain, grazing lands requiring permission, safety risks on steep or boggy ground.
- Data quality considerations: potential biases in plot placement are mitigated by strict random-location procedures; minor inaccuracies may arise from bearing errors, pace variability, or slope effects.
- Use of aerial photographs as an alternative locating method if available to improve ground-truth alignment.

## Tools, Equipment, and Procedures

- Tools: Silva compass, pace counting, clinometer (clino-meter) for slope, central/post-orientation hardware, cords and pegs to lay out five nested quadrats, auger for soil, spade, bags for samples, wing-nut/fasteners, and data sheets.
- Procedure flow:
  - Locate plot using map/photo features and bearings.
  - Set up five nested quadrats with center and corner posts and taut cords.
  - Record ground flora from smallest to largest quadrats, noting new species per quadrat.
  - Describe soil profile at plot centre; collect soil cores as needed.
  - Complete habitat data sheets for plot and surrounding 50 m edge.
  - Check and bag any unidentified plant material for later identification.
  - Complete and file field sheets; move to next plot.

## Documentation and Examples

- The handbook provides figures and example completed sheets to illustrate data structure and entry procedures for plot habitat, 50 m edge habitats, aquatic habitats, animals, and management data.
- Appendix and example datasets from actual field visits (Shetland) intended to guide new field teams.

## Summary

- The document provides a comprehensive, standardized protocol for a multi-scale vegetation and habitat survey in Shetland, combining rigorous plot-based plant inventories, soil profiling, and extensive habitat/land-use recording.
- Data are structured to support later multivariate analysis and predictive modeling, with careful attention to minimizing sampling bias, ensuring data quality, and enabling self-contained data products for broad use.
