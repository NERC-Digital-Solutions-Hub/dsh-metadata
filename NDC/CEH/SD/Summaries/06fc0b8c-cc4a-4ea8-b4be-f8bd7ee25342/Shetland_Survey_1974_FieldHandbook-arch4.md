# VEGETATION SURVEY OF SHETLAND HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- The handbook outlines a detailed, field-based vegetation survey designed to document Shetland’s terrestrial vegetation, habitats, and related environmental factors in the context of potential oil-related development and associated planning.
- The survey is led by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (formerly Nature Conservancy) with methods developed at Merlewood to enable multivariate analysis and future modelling.

## Purpose, scope and context
- Purpose: provide a comprehensive, replicable set of methods for a summer vegetation survey of Shetland, including data collection, habitat assessment, and soil description.
- Context: Shetland’s varied geology, climate, and land use (crofts, grazing, potential oil infrastructure) drive the need to map vegetation, habitats, and environmental features to predict impacts and support planning.
- Data aims: create standardized field data suitable for multivariate analyses (ordination) and subsequent mathematical modelling of environmental effects on vegetation.

## Survey design and data scope
- Sampling framework: randomly distributed plots marked on maps or aerial photos; each plot is a 200 m2 quadrat with nested sampling within four smaller quadrats.
- Plot setup: five posts and cords define a central point; a cross attached to the centre post orients the diagonals, enabling random, bias-free placement of plots.
- Nested quadrats (from inside out): 4 m2, 25 m2, 50 m2, 100 m2, and 200 m2 sampling units; these capture ground flora and habitat structure at increasing scales.
- Data to collect per plot: ground flora, soils and soil horizons, habitats (within the plot and up to 50 m outside the plot), aquatic habitats, and management/land-use indicators.
- Data handling goal: produce a complete field sheet set for each plot that can be translated into quantitative cover-abundance data and later fed into multivariate analyses and models.

## Plot locating, plotting and data collection procedures
- Plot locating: begin with a recognizable landscape feature near the target plot, then use a control point, bearings (with magnetic declination corrected), and measured distance to place the plot on ground; pace counting adjusted for slope and pace variation to minimize bias.
- Aerial photo option: if available, use 1:10,000 scale aerial photographs with center pins to navigate to the plot area.
- Quadrat setup: center stake placed at the plot centre; orientation fixed by spinning the centre cross; orange cords mark corners for four nested quadrats; five sampling units are integrated with concentric boundaries.
- Ground flora recording: start with 4 m2 quadrat, record all plants, bag doubtful identifications for later confirmation, exclude soil-epiphytic mosses/lichens from ground flora, and compile percent cover to the nearest 5% across quadrats.
- Soil sampling and description: describe soil from a central profile; collect cores with an auger; record horizon depths, texture, color, decomposition, moisture, structure, and other soil properties using a predefined data sheet; depths extend to auger limits or maximum 75 cm as applicable.
- Data sheets and coding: fill in plant presence/abundance data across all quadrats, use specific codes for species and habitat attributes, and complete “code” fields for later data sorting.

## Habitat data collection and management indicators
- Plot habitat sheet: record slope, aspect, rockiness, habitat types (dense heather, grassland, Sphagnum tussocks, epiphytic lichens, aquatic vegetation, macrofungi, etc.), and microhabitats (epiphytic lichens, bryophytes, aquatic bryophytes, moss tussocks, etc.).
- Habitats within 50 m: capture features outside the plot that may influence the plot, using the same habitat categories as the plot sheet.
- Management and land-use data: record signs of grazing, fencing, drains, croft use or ruin, buildings, rubbish, paths/tracks, peat extraction or burning history, and other anthropogenic factors.
- Aquatic and aquatic-edge features: document pool, pond, lake, river characteristics, water speed, beds, seepage, drought indicators, and signs of water management or disturbance.
- Animal signs and grazing indicators: record presence of livestock, droppings density, and grazing impact (e.g., sheep lay, no grazing, etc.).
- Documentation of geological context: where possible, note geology, drift materials, and other site-specific descriptive data.

## 50 m area habitats and data integration
- The 50 m area habitat sheet extends the plot data to a surrounding zone, incorporating similar aquatic, terrestrial, and management indicators, with slightly expanded categories to capture broader edge effects and land-use influences.
- Data entry examples and completed sheets illustrate how field observations translate into structured datasets for analysis.

## Finishing, data quality and practical considerations
- Finishing the plot: verify all strata and plot numbers are entered across sheets, confirm two soil cores have been collected, collect any unidentified plant material, and pack samples for transport.
- Data quality: designed to minimize bias through random plot placement and standardized measurement procedures; data intended for subsequent ordination and modelling to predict vegetation responses to environmental factors and land-use changes.
- Practical constraints: fieldwork aligned with March field season; remote locations and island logistics; permissions needed for grazing lands; use of aerial photos where possible to facilitate plot location.

## Output and use
- Data sheets: examples of completed plot habitat sheets, 50 m area habitat sheets, aquatic habitat sheets, and management/land-use sheets demonstrate how observations are recorded and structured.
- End products: a comprehensive, standardized dataset suitable for multivariate analysis, ordination, and predictive modelling to inform environmental planning and impact assessments for Shetland.

## Appendix and supplementary notes
- The handbook includes example field sheets and references to the data collection workflow, aiming to provide hands-on guidance for teams new to Shetland field surveys and to illustrate typical plant assemblages (e.g., Serpentine and blanket bog examples).
