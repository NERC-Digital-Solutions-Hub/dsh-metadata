# Survey of the terrestrial habitats and vegetation of Shetland, 1974

## Overview
- A comprehensive field survey of Shetland’s terrestrial habitat, vegetation and soils conducted in 1974.
- Data collected to assess variation in vegetation, provide a user guide to habitat types, and establish a baseline for monitoring future change.
- Dataset is managed with standardized methods and is associated with a broader environmental monitoring context, including potential oil-exploration impact assessments.

## Geographic and Temporal Scope
- Geographic coverage: Shetland Islands, Scotland.
- Time period: 1974 (data management/version note: Version 1.1 August 2015).
- Data components cover vegetation, soils, and habitats, with supplementary information on ground flora.

## Sampling Design
- Stratified sampling across the land area of Shetland; 16 distinct strata identified from map-based attributes.
- Within each stratum, 5 plots were randomly selected per 1 km2 area, totaling 927 planned plots; 911 actually surveyed (some inaccessible or in crop fields).
- Each 1 km2 area was divided into 16 sub-squares; within each sub-square, a 200 m2 plot was randomly chosen (survey within sub-squares; water-covered sub-squares omitted).
- Nested quadrat sampling within each 200 m2 plot: 4 m2 → 25 m2 → 50 m2 → 100 m2 → 200 m2, with new species recorded at larger scales.

## Data Collected and Structure (GIS-relevant)
- Vegetation data: All vascular plants, bryophytes and macro-lichens recorded; percent cover estimated and assigned to classes.
- Soil data: Horizon depths, horizon descriptions, and top 10 cm soil pH (field-measured).
- Habitat data: Within-plot and within-50 m surrounding area; slope and aspect measured; habitat categories defined and recorded.
- Ground flora data: Species list per nest (plot) with cover percentages; taxonomic nomenclature aligned with standard references.
- Data files available:
  - SHETLAND_SURVEY_PLOT_DATA.csv: Descriptions for soil, plot habitat and habitats within 50 m of each plot.
  - SHETLAND_SURVEY_PLOT_INFO.csv: Slope, aspect and detailed soil horizon and pH measurements per plot.
  - SHETLAND_SURVEY_GROUND_FLORA.csv: Species list for nested plots with cover percentages.
- Confidentiality note: Precise plot locations are held confidential by CEH to protect landowner privacy; squares represent sampling of Land Classes and are described in Bunce & Bassett (2015).

## Data Quality and Methods
- Methods closely follow Bunce & Shaw (1973) standardized ecological survey procedures.
- Field handbook (Shetland Vegetation Survey: Handbook of Field Methods) provides full methodological details.
- Field measurements include:
  - Vegetation: nested quadrats with species lists and percentage cover.
  - Soil: horizon depth and descriptive categories; pH via field measurements.
  - Habitat: internal plot and surrounding 50 m habitat classifications; slope and aspect measurements.
- Data management and documentation performed by C. Wood, C. Hallam, D. Caffrey.

## Original Purpose and Context
- Terrestrial component of a larger project to assess Shetland’s natural environment.
- Aimed to support environmental impact assessments (e.g., oil exploration) and to provide a baseline for monitoring vegetation change.
- Specific objectives:
  - Assess variation within Shetland’s vegetation and define habitat types.
  - Provide a framework for monitoring future vegetation change.

## Data Access and Privacy
- Precise locations of survey squares are confidential to protect privacy.
- Squares are representative samples of Land Classes; detailed location information is withheld (described in Bunce & Bassett, 2015).

## GIS Use and Potential Data Products
- Possible GIS layers:
  - Vegetation community distribution and species composition by plot.
  - Soil horizon depths and pH by plot.
  - Habitat categories within plot and within 50 m surroundings.
  - Topographic context: slope and aspect per plot.
- Considerations:
  - 1974 time frame; dataset provides a historical baseline for change detection.
  - Confidential plot locations require access permissions or aggregated representations for public sharing.
  - Data are organized at multiple resolutions (plot-level 200 m2, habitat within 50 m, stratified 1 km2 blocks) enabling multi-scale mapping.
- Potential analyses:
  - Habitat type mapping and trend analysis over time (where follow-up data exist).
  - Correlation of vegetation composition with soil characteristics (horizon depths, pH).
  - Spatial patterns of vegetation and habitat distribution across strata.

## Summary
- The Survey of the terrestrial habitats and vegetation of Shetland, 1974, provides a rigorously collected, standardized dataset describing vegetation, soils and habitats across 16 stratified zones on Shetland.
- It employs a robust sampling design (1 km2 strata with 911 plots, nested quadrats) and records comprehensive attributes suitable for GIS-based analysis, with essential caveats around location privacy and 1974-era data.
- The dataset supports historical baselining, habitat characterization, and environmental monitoring, with clearly defined data files and methodological documentation for GIS integration.
