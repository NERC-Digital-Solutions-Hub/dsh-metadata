# Explanation of Ecological Types

## Overview
- Provides an introduction to fuller type summaries and a rapid method for checking the affinities of a given platform.
- Uses standardized phrases to describe types, with figures largely replaced by phrases; pH values provided where summaries include them.
- Aims to aid rapid comparison and assessment of ecological types across a landscape or archipelago.

## Typology and structure
- Describes a comprehensive typology of vegetation types (Types 1–32) largely focused on peatland/vegetation communities.
- Each type includes:
  - Major cover species (dominant plants).
  - Indicator species (positive, negative, and their frequency scores).
  - A scoring framework (GLYPH values) to classify presence and affinity to a type.
  - Occurrence information (average, widespread, limited, absent from certain areas).
  - Habitat associations (peat depth, moisture, pH, presence of water features, erosion, streams, rocks, marshes).
  - Characteristic constellations (species groups A, B, C, etc. as constants) and notable species co-occurrences.
- Types emphasize Calluna-dominated communities and related peatland/rocky coastal/intermittent-water habitats.
- Geographic notes indicate restricted or absent occurrences in certain locations (e.g., absent from Yell and Unst; present across islands; some types limited to coastal zones or inland areas).

## Key type characteristics (highlights)
- Type 1 to Type 4: Sets the groundwork with dominant peatland species (Calluna, Eriophorum, Rhacomitrium, Sphagnum) and associated selective indicator species; typically deep, wet, acidic peat with varying moisture regimes.
- Type 8 to Type 12: Emphasizes Sphagnum-rich or near-water/stream habitats; includes characteristic combinations of Calluna with specific mosses and bog species; often widespread with deep peat.
- Type 13 to Type 18: Includes more eroded peat and rocky/thin-soil contexts; frequent alongside water trickles, rooks, and varying pH; mixture of Calluna with Nardus and associated grasses and forbs.
- Type 19 to Type 21: Coastal/damp to marshy conditions; emphasis on water movement, drainage channels, and damp soils; includes presence of indicator species tied to damp microhabitats.
- Type 22 to Type 24: More localized maritimé and serpentine/debris soils contexts; rocky outcrops, damp shallow soils, and specific calcareous/serpentine conditions; high pH in some instances.
- Type 25 to Type 32: Includes grazing-impacted, agriculturally managed, or heavily modified habitats; a mix of sedges, grasses, forbs, and indicator species tied to managed or disturbed peat/mineral soils; many types show restricted coastal distributions or strong grazing signatures.

## Indicator species and scoring
- Indicator species are listed for each type, with positive or negative associations and GLYPH thresholds that determine Type assignment (e.g., Score +2, +3, or higher may designate Type X; negative scores can move toward Type Y).
- Species groups A, B, C, D, E, F, G, etc. are used as constants to help identify and classify types.
- The presence and frequency of these indicator species guide monitoring decisions and help detect shifts between types over time.

## Data, metadata, and monitoring implications
- The document relies on detailed species composition and habitat parameters (major cover species, indicator species, pH, soil depth, soil moisture index, presence of water features, erosion status).
- Requires comprehensive field data collection to assign plots to a type and to monitor transitions between types.
- The dense species lists and rules for Type assignment imply a need for standardized data collection, metadata, and consistency in reporting to support data sharing and governance.
- Some types have geographic or habitat restrictions, which has implications for spatial monitoring coverage and data completeness.

## Endnotes for monitoring frameworks
- Serves as a structured framework for classifying peatland vegetation into discrete types using objective indicators.
- Supports policy evaluation and decision-making by providing a repeatable typology, clear habitat associations, and explicit indicator species criteria.
- Highlights data gaps and the importance of metadata quality, reproducibility, and appropriate data governance to enable sharing and reuse across agencies.
