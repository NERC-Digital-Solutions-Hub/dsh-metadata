# HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS VEGETATION SURVEY OF SHETLAND

- Purpose and context
  - Document outlines the summer vegetation survey in Shetland to assess impacts of potential oil development on geology, landscape, and wildlife.
  - Aims to fill knowledge gaps, enable later modelling (e.g., multivariate ordination), and support development planning and environmental predictions.
  - Data will underpin mathematical models predicting effects of factors on Shetland’s environment; methods adapted from Merlewood and used in Britain.

- Study area and background
  - Shetland Islands: dispersed islands with diverse geology (metamorphic rocks, Old Red Sandstone, granites, serpentine, etc.), peat-rich areas, and variable topography.
  - Climate: mild, moist, windy; proximity to sea reduces temperature variation; frequent mist/drizzle; strong winds and substantial rainfall.
  - Human context: small population; traditional industries include fishing, crofting, knitting; upcoming offshore oil development raises potential conflicts with natural features.

- Survey design and data goals
  - Random sampling: randomly distributed plots on maps or aerial photographs; field plots located with objective methods to minimize bias.
  - Plot framework: a central 200 m quadrat used to define five nested quadrats for vegetation sampling (4 m, 25 m, 50 m, 100 m, 200 m).
  - Data types: terrestrial vegetation, freshwater and littoral habitats, sea-bird populations; soil profiles; geohydrology; macrohabitats; and management/land-use attributes.

- Field methods: locating and setting plots
  - Plot location approach
    - Use a clearly identifiable nearby landscape feature as a control point, then determine the plot by triangulating bearings and measured distances from the control.
    - Bearings adjusted for magnetic declination; distance measured with the compass scale; pace-counted stepping to place the plot precisely.
    - If necessary, use aerial photographs or pre-drawn maps to locate plots before ground survey.
    - Ensure no subjective bias in plot placement; skip plots on dangerous ground or cultivated land after assessment; obtain permission for grazing land as needed.
  - Alternative locating methods
    - Aerial photographs at 1:10,000 scale can locate plots; in-field navigation follows identifiable ground features from the photos.

- Plot setup and data collection within the 200 m quadrat
  - Quadrats and layout
    - Center post anchored at plot center; diagonals oriented randomly via a cross spun by the top post.
    - Five concentric quadrats marked by colored cords from the center: 4 m, 25 m, 50 m, 100 m, and 200 m.
  - Ground flora data collection
    - Begin in the smallest 4 m quadrat; record bryophytes and macrolichens on the ground (ignore epiphytic forms on living plants).
    - Move progressively to larger quadrats, recording only species not already observed in inner quadrats.
    - Estimate percent cover-abundance for each species to the nearest 5%; for widely scattered species, use lower cover categories; two team members estimate and average for reliability.
    - Record cover-abundance for non-plant categories (rock, bare ground, litter) at the bottom of the sheet.
  - Soil sampling and description
    - Expose a central soil profile with an auger; describe litter, organic matter, mineral horizons, color, texture, moisture, and decomposition.
    - Record depths of layers (litter, organic matter, mineral horizons, leached layers) and maximum depth if deeper than auger length.
    - Use a standardized soil data sheet with predefined attributes; if a layer is absent, mark accordingly.
  - Habitat data (Plot habitat sheets)
    - Plot habitat sheet: measure slope with a clinometer, determine aspect with a compass, and record habitat features (rocky outcrops, gulleys, soil types, vegetation types).
    - Document a wide range of microhabitats (dense heather, grassland, Sphagnum tussocks, moss, epiphytic lichens, aquatic vegetation, macrofungi, etc.).
  - 50 m area habitats
    - A separate sheet records features outside the 200 m plot up to 50 m from the edge, including aquatic habitats, vegetation, animals, management, land use, and signs of human activity.
  - Aquatic habitats and animals
    - Record true aquatic plants and classify water bodies (pool, pond, lake, fast/slow streams, marsh, river bank, river cutting, etc.).
    - Note animals observed or signs (droppings, grazing signs, root/bone remains, rabbits, cattle, ponies, sheep, birds).
  - Management and land-use
    - Record management features (fences, drains, peat cutting, crofts, buildings, midden, tracks, roads, rubbish, burning) and land-use types (improved grazing, arable, peatlands, grassland, dunes, marshes, river/shore geomorphology).
  - Documentation and completeness
    - Ensure all five sheets (plot habitat, 50 m habitat, aquatic, animals, management/land use) are complete; collect soil samples and unidentified plants for later identification.
    - Examples of completed sheets are provided to illustrate data recording.

- Data handling and outputs
  - Data collection is designed to enable later multivariate analysis and model development.
  - Field sheets are standardized for consistency and future data sharing (with metadata and sample recovery).
  - The handbook includes example field sheets to guide novices and to demonstrate typical vegetation and habitat data.

- Finishing and continuation
  - At the end of a plot, verify that all strata and plot numbers are recorded on the sheets, all soil samples are collected, and any unidentified plants are kept for later work.
  - Pack field materials and move to the next plot, repeating the procedure.
  - The handbook notes that actual field sheets presented are real datasets from o a short March field visit, illustrating practical application.

- Overall structure and intent
  - A comprehensive, standardized, field-based protocol for assessing Shetland’s vegetation, soils, habitats, and human influences to support environmental understanding and future modelling amid development pressures.
