# HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS VEGETATION SURVEY OF SHETLAND

## Overview
- Purpose: Explain this summer's vegetation survey, its aims, and detailed field methods.
- Scope: Terrestrial vegetation; freshwater and littoral habitats; seabird populations; groundwork for later modeling of Shetland’s environment.
- Approach: Standardized, repeatable field procedures with predefined data sheets; plans to analyse data with multivariate techniques to describe vegetation variation and build predictive models.

## Study Area and Context
- Location: Shetland Islands (~550 square miles; many islands), diverse geology (metamorphic rocks, Old Red Sandstone, granite, serpentine), and varied topography.
- Climate and land: Mild, moist, windy; coastal exposure with peatlands, sparsely forested; key traditional industries include fishing, crofting, knitting.
- Relevance: Potential large-scale oil development may affect geology, landscape, and wildlife; baseline vegetation data are needed to assess impacts.

## Aims and Scope
- Primary aim: Establish baseline knowledge of natural vegetation and habitats to inform development planning and environmental modeling.
- Data types: Terrestrial vegetation, freshwater and littoral habitats, sea-bird populations; subsequent geon morphologic and ecological models using collected data.

## Data Collection Framework

### Plot Design and Sampling Scheme
- Sampling framework: Randomly distributed sampling plots to avoid bias; general area reconnaissance to locate plots.
- Basic sampling unit: A 200 m quadrat centered on a plot coordinate.
- Nested quadrats: Five concentric quadrats within the 200 m plot (centre 4 m, 25 m, 50 m, 100 m, 200 m on a diagonal layout) for recording vegetation.
- Purpose: Capture fine-scale to broader-scale vegetation variation within each plot.

### Plot Location and Grounding
- Location methods: 
  - Use easily identifiable landscape features near each plot as reference points.
  - Visually consult maps or aerial photographs (1:10,000 scale) if available; use a Silva compass for bearings; apply exact pacing to locate plot center.
- Bias minimization: For ground truth, determine plot position from map to ground with careful, repeatable steps; adjust for slope and pace as described.
- Practical constraints: Some plots may be avoided due to safety, cultivated land, or grazing permissions; aerial photos may substitute in some cases.

### Quadrat Setup and Orientation
- Central placement: Center post driven into ground at the plot center; cross oriented randomly by spinning the central cross before locking.
- Diagonal alignment: Four corner posts connected by orange cords; taut lines define the nested quadrats.
- Quadrat sizes: 
  - 4 m quadrat (innermost)
  - 25 m quadrat
  - 50 m quadrat
  - 100 m quadrat
  - 200 m quadrat
- Orientation: The random orientation of the central cross ensures unbiased diagonal placement for all nested quadrats.

## Data Recording and Variables Collected

### Ground Flora (Primary Vegetation Data)
- Recording order: Start with the 4 m quadrat; record bryophytes and macrolichens on soil; fragile identifications placed in labeled bags for later verification.
- Progressive sampling: Move to 25 m, then 50 m, 100 m, and 200 m quadrats; record only species not already observed in inner quadrats.
- Coverage estimates: Estimate percent cover-abundance for each species to the nearest 5%; obtain two independent estimates and average them for reliability.
- Data sheets: Use defined data sheets (examples in figures) to capture species presence, strata, and cover.

### Soil Profile and Soil Data
- Soil sampling: Expose a central soil profile; describe horizons with a standardized soil data sheet.
- Depths: Use auger to determine depths of litter, organic layers, transition to mineral soil, and other horizons; record maximum depths when necessary.
- Attributes: Color, decomposition, texture (clay, silt, sand, gravel), moisture, structure, and presence of organic and mineral layers; note not present sections by crossing them out.
- Special notes: If peat or organic layers are deep, indicate maximum depths (75 cm+ where applicable).

### Habitat and Microhabitats (Plot Habitat Sheet)
- Plot-level attributes: Slope (measured with clinometer), aspect, and a range of habitat categories (rocky outcrops, scree, rock patterns, grassland, moss/tussocks, epiphytic lichens, aquatic vegetation, macrofungi, trees/shrubs, etc.).
- 50 m edge habitats: Record habitats lying outside the plot up to 50 m from the edge to capture influences on the plot.
- Descriptive categories: For each habitat type, record presence, extent, and notable characteristics (e.g., dense Heather, grassland extent, moss tussocks, bryophyte richness).
- Tools: Plot habitat sheets and 50 m edge habitat sheets; slope, aspect measured with the provided instruments.

### Aquatic Habitats, Animals, and Management
- Aquatic habitats: Document pool, pond, lake, slow/fast rivers or streams, marsh/bog, river/stream bottom types, springs, and related features (e.g., water depth, turbidity).
- Animals: Note signs of grazing, droppings, presence of livestock (ponies, cattle, sheep), signs of past grazing, and other fauna indicators (rabbits, birds).
- Management: Record human influences (crofts, fences, drainage lines, buildings, rubbish, tracks, roads, peat cutting, burning, past burning, quarrying) and landforms (inland vs coastal features).
- Ownership and use: Distinguish in-use crofts, built structures, and enclosures; note hutting, midden, harbour of roads, and other human activity indicators.
- Land use and landforms: Classify areas as improved grazing, arable, rough grazing, blanket peat, saltmarsh, dunes, river gorges, etc.

## Data Quality, Consistency, and Bias Mitigation
- Randomization emphasis: Strict, bias-free plot location; use of control points and bearings to ensure ground-truth correspondence with map locations.
- Inter-observer reliability: Dual estimation for cover percentages; mean of two estimates recommended for reliability.
- Documentation: Use standardized sheets to facilitate data consistency and later data merging; examples included to illustrate proper completion.

## Data Management, Analysis, and Outputs

- Data formats and storage: Field sheets are designed to feed into a centralized database; sheets capture plots, habitats, species, soil attributes, and management data.
- Intended analyses: Multivariate techniques (ordination) to characterize vegetation variation across Shetland and to inform the development of predictive models of environmental responses.
- Data provenance and transparency: Detailed field procedures and example completed sheets (figures) provide reproducibility and traceability of data collection.

## Practicalities, Limitations, and Ethics

- Field realities: Some plots may be unsafe or inaccessible; alternatives include using aerial photographs or adjusting plot locations accordingly.
- Permissions: When plots are on grazed lands, obtain crofter permission; avoid cultivated fields unless permissions are secured.
- Logistics: Fieldwork can involve multiple islands; camping equipment provided where needed; field teams may operate from multiple bases.

## Endnotes and Data Context

- Example datasets: Completed field sheets provided as exemplars to illustrate data collection and entry (Stratum, Plot, Habitat, and associated measurements) and to orient new field workers.
- Appendices and figures: Include example plots (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) and data sheets to guide consistent data capture and interpretation.
