# Explanation of Ecological Type Summaries

- Purpose: Introduce fuller type summaries and provide a rapid method for checking the affinities of a given plot, using standardized phrases and providing pH values in the summaries. It covers a range of vegetation types and their ecological characteristics.

- Scope and structure:
  - Classifies vegetation into discrete types (Types 1–32) based on heterogeneity, species complement, major cover species, and indicator species.
  - Describes typical habitat associations, peat depth, soil wetness, and pH ranges for each type.
  - Uses indicator species and GLYPH scoring to support type assignment and to distinguish between types.

- Data and terminology used:
  - Heterogeneity categories: Low, Average, and High (with corresponding type descriptions).
  - Major cover species: dominant plants that define each type (often Calluna, Sphagnum, Eriophorum, etc.).
  - Indicator species: listed organisms used to differentiate types, with GLYPH score thresholds (e.g., GLYPH<9/GLYPH<10) guiding type assignment.
  - Habitat features: associations with peat depth, moisture/wetness, erosion, water channels, streams, rock outcrops, and coastal/maritime contexts.
  - Occurrence patterns: notes on whether types are limited, average, widespread, or absent in certain geographic areas (e.g., Unst, Yell).

- Types overview (conceptual):
  - Types are described with specific combinations of major cover species, selective species, and the presence/absence of bare peat.
  - Each type includes typical environmental conditions (peat depth, moisture, and pH), occurrence frequency, and constant species groups.
  - Examples of type themes include:
    - Calluna-dominated peat types with varying degrees of moisture, erosion, and rock proximity.
    - Sphagnum-influenced types with surface water features or tussocks.
    - Coastal/maritime and rock-influenced variants with specific plant assemblages.
  - Some types emphasize very restricted occurrences (e.g., near the coast or specific serpetine substrates), while others are widespread across the islands.

- How to use the data for analysis and products:
  - Plot classification: combine environmental data (pH, peat depth, wetness) with species presence/absence and indicator scores to assign a Type.
  - Indicator-based scoring: utilize GLYPH thresholds to support Type decisions (e.g., Type X when certain indicator species reach defined scores).
  - Outputable products: 
    - Type classifications per plot
    - Maps of Type distributions across regions
    - Dashboards showing the relationship between environmental variables and Type
    - Reports highlighting dominant and selective species per Type

- Practical data considerations:
  - Data heterogeneity: several formats and varying levels of detail across plots; need standardization to apply Type descriptions uniformly.
  - Data gaps: incomplete species lists, missing pH or depth data can hinder accurate typing; consider expert review when unsure.
  - Geographic variation: some types are geographically restricted; incorporate location checks to improve accuracy (e.g., offshore vs inland plots).

- Key challenges to anticipate:
  - Patchy or inconsistent data across sites.
  - Communicating complex ecological descriptions in simple, user-friendly visuals for end users.
  - Ensuring outputs are widely shared and reused by integrating clear documentation and provenance for Type assignments.

- End-user value:
  - Provides a rapid, reference-driven framework to interpret vegetation plots.
  - Enables self-serve exploration of plot affinities, environmental context, and indicator species.
  - Supports data-driven decision making for management and policy in peatland and coastal ecosystems.
