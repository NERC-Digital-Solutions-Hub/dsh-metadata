# Introduction to the Full Type Summaries

- A rapid, structured guide to classifying island vegetation into discrete types based on dominant, selective, and indicator species.
- Each type (1–30) is defined by major cover species, typical habitat (peat depth, pH, moisture), and occurrence across the islands.
- The system uses GLYPH scores and indicator species to help assign plots to a type and to interpret ecological affinities.
- Occurrence patterns are noted (average vs widespread, island-by-island presence/absence) and often tied to habitat features (peat depth, erosion, proximity to sea, streams, rockiness).

## How to use this typology ( Analysts’ data-driven approach)

- Identify the dominant (major cover) species in a plot and check for key selective/indicator species.
- Use pH, soil depth, and wetness descriptors to constrain possible types (e.g., deep, wet, acidic peat vs dry, rocky soils).
- Apply GLYPH scores and the listed indicator species to assign the plot to the closest type; consult constant species groups (A, B, C, D, etc.) used to support classification.
- Consider geographic patterns and occurrence notes (e.g., absences on Yell or Unst, inland vs coastal distribution) to refine typing.
- Use the type descriptions to infer habitat characteristics, ecosystem processes (erosion, peatland dynamics, water channels), and potential management implications.

## Core habitat patterns and defining features

- Peatland and wetland types are characterized by deep, wet, acidic peat (often pH around 4.4–4.9), with Sphagnum, Calluna, and Erio­phorum angusti­folium frequently prominent; moisture and erosion status influence type assignment.
- Inland to coastal gradients are reflected in type distribution (some types are inland-only or coastal-restricted; several are absent from outer islands like Unst or specific isles such as Yell or Unst in particular entries).
- Common habitat features across many types include:
  - Deep wet peat and tussocks with featureless peat surfaces or water channels.
  - Erosion stages of peat, with bare peat patches more common in some types.
  - Streamsides, damp banks, and occasionally marshy zones or ditches.
  - Rock outcrops and serpentine or mineral soils near the sea, often with different pH and moisture regimes.
- Indicator and selective species help distinguish closely related communities (e.g., Calluna-dominated types vs Sphagnum-dominated types; numerous Cladonia and lichens sections for specific microtypes).

## Indicator species and scoring concepts (GLYPH)

- Each type includes a set of indicator species with associated GLYPH thresholds (e.g., GLYPH<9>, GLYPH<10>), used to differentiate among similar communities.
- Indicator species lists vary by type and help signal the presence of particular habitat conditions (e.g., moisture regime, substrate type, disturbance history, or shoreline influence).
- Scoring schemes often combine multiple species signals to classify plots into Type categories; some types are defined by high- or low-frequency occurrences of particular indicators.

## Representative type snapshots (illustrative examples)

- Type 1: Cladonia/Caledonian-peat association with low heterogeneity; inland, deeper peat, limited bare ground; major cover including Calluna and Erio­phorum; typical of eroded peat surfaces at deeper depths.
- Type 9: Calluna-dominated with Sphagnum and Erio­phorum angusti­folium; widespread inland distribution; damp, deep peat with low bare ground and a characteristic lichens assemblage.
- Type 18: Deschampsia flexuosa–Junco association near the sea; widespread coastal occurrence; damp, deep peat with peat diggings and rocky substrates; presence of Gali­um naxatile and other rock-associated species.
- Type 25–30 range across base grassland and grazed/dry-marine soils (e.g., Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus, Poa annua, Festuca rubra); these types are typically restricted to more exposed maritime or agricultural contexts, often heavily grazed, with shallower mineral soils and higher pH.
- These examples illustrate how major and selective species, together with habitat descriptors and GLYPH indicators, separate peatland communities from maritime rocky/shrubland communities and from grazed grassland types.

## Geographic distribution and data considerations

- Several types show island-specific patterns (absences from Unst, Yell, or other islands) and may be coastal vs inland in their prevalence.
- Occurrence levels range from limited to widespread, with some types described as “average” in occurrence and others as “very heterogeneous.”
- The typology assumes consistent survey data on species presence, substrate depth, pH, and moisture; when data are incomplete, type assignment relies more heavily on dominant species and habitat cues.

## Data interpretation and analyst guidance

- Use major cover species as the primary hook for typing, then confirm with indicator species and GLYPH scores.
- Cross-check habitat parameters (peat depth, pH, wetness) to distinguish closely related types.
- Leverage occurrence notes to assess plausibility given the plot’s geographic location relative to sea, streams, and inland features.
- Be mindful of data quality and scale: some types assume long-run conditions (peat dynamics, erosion) that may not be fully captured in a single plot.
- For reporting, link type identifications to habitat drivers (peat depth, moisture regime, erosion, proximity to sea) and to potential management implications (grazing pressure, drainage channels, peat excavation).

## Limitations and cautions

- The catalog relies on a predefined set of types with fixed indicator and major species lists; real plots may exhibit transitional or mixed characteristics not neatly captured by a single type.
- Geographic and island-specific occurrences are informative but may not generalize beyond the studied area without additional data.
- Indicator lists and GLYPH thresholds require accurate species identification and consistent sampling methods to ensure reliable typing.

## Summary takeaway

- The document provides a comprehensive, data-driven framework to classify island vegetation into 30 distinct types based on dominant species, habitat conditions, and indicator species signals.
- Analysts can apply this framework to diagnose plot affinities, infer habitat and ecological processes, and support consistent reporting across islands and hedged by coastal vs inland contexts.
