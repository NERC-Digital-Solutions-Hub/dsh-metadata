# Survey of the terrestrial habitats and vegetation of Shetland, 1974

## Overview
- Comprehensive terrestrial habitat, vegetation, and soil dataset for Shetland, collected in 1974 as part of a larger project to assess the environment and monitor change.
- Purpose: enable environmental impact assessment (e.g., oil exploration) and provide a basis for future change monitoring; includes guidance for classifying vegetation/types.

## Scope, Coverage, and Period
- Geographic coverage: Shetland Islands, Scotland.
- Time period: 1974 (survey conducted in that year).
- Data categories: vegetation data (vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens), soil data (horizon depths, pH), habitat data (within plot and within 50 m of plot), and associated site metadata.

## Sampling Design and Methods
- Survey design: stratified sampling across the entire area, yielding 16 distinct strata; within each stratum, 5 plots per 1 km^2 were selected.
- Plot details: 927 plots selected; 911 actually surveyed due to accessibility and field conditions.
- Plot layout: each 1 km^2 unit subdivided into 16 sub-squares; a 200 m^2 vegetation plot was randomly sampled within each sub-square.
- Data collection methods:
  - Vegetation: nested quadrat system (4 m^2, 25 m^2, 50 m^2, 100 m^2, and 200 m^2) with species presence and percent cover by size class.
  - Soil: surface horizon classification and deeper horizons via pits and auger samples; top 10 cm sampled for pH.
  - Habitat: recording of habitat types both inside the plot and within 50 m of the edge; slope and aspect measured.
  - Data recording: standardised field sheets and codes; annual year marked as 1974.
- Standards and field guides: Bunce & Shaw (1973) standardized survey procedures; Bunce (1974) Field Methods Handbook; Milner (1975) monitoring reports; ongoing work (2015) on land classification and database foundations.

## Data Contents and Structure
- Vegetation data: vascular plants, bryophytes, and macro-lichens; species lists (Appendix II) and coding for species identity.
- Soil data: horizon depths, horizon descriptions, pH values (top 10 cm sample).
- Habitat data: within-plot and within-50m habitat classifications; slope and aspect.
- Data products (CSV files):
  - SHETLAND_SURVEY_PLOT_DATA.csv — descriptions for soil, plot habitat, and habitats within 50 m of each plot.
  - SHETLAND_SURVEY_PLOT_INFO.csv — slope, aspect, soil horizon depths/descriptions, pH, etc.
  - SHETLAND_SURVEY_GROUND_FLORA.csv — species list per nested plot with cover percentages.
- Appendices:
  - Appendix I – Plot Codes (strata/plot coding and references).
  - Appendix II – Full species list (extensive vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens).

## Provenance and Management
- Originator/field leadership: R.G.H. Bunce and collaborators; Institute of Terrestrial Ecology – Merlewood.
- Field surveyors: list of multiple researchers who collected vegetation, soils, and habitat data.
- Data management and documentation: C. Wood, C. Hallam, D. Caffrey.
- Original purpose and related work: Part of the Shetland environment project; linked to broader projects (Shetland Freshwater Survey 1974; Shetland Coastal Survey 1974) and ongoing evaluation (Bunce et al., 2015).

## Data Governance, Access, and Privacy
- Location privacy: precise locations of survey squares held in confidence by CEH to protect landowner privacy; squares are representative samples of broader land classes.
- Publication and reuse: dataset intended for discovery and reuse with caution regarding privacy; related documentation and references provide context for interpretation and governance.

## Data Quality, Standards, and Documentation
- Standardized methods ensure consistency across plots and years; detailed field procedures and coding documented in referenced handbooks.
- Metadata includes site code (strata), plot number, year (1974), survey strata subgroups, and field sheet references.
- Documentation and provenance: originators, field team, and data management staff explicitly recorded; versioning indicated (Version 1.1, August 2015).

## Usage, Applications, and Limitations
- Applications: environmental status assessment, change monitoring, and habitat/vegetation baselines for conservation and impact studies.
- Limitations: not all surveyed plots may be accessible; some sub-squares omitted (water-covered); coordinates are confidential to protect landowners’ privacy.
- Related datasets and publications provide context for longitudinal use and integration with other Shetland projects.
