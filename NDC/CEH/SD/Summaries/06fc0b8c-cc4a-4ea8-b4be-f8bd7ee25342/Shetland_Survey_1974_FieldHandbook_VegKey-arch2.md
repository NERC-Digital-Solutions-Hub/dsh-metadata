# Explanation of Ecological Type Descriptions

## Purpose and Scope
- Provides an introduction to a fuller set of type summaries and a rapid method to check the affinities of a given plate (grid/plot).
- Uses standardized phrases (often instead of figures) to describe vegetation types, with pH values supplied by summaries.
- Aims to support monitoring and comparison of environmental health across time and space.

## Data and Methods
- Establishes a typology of habitat/vegetation types (Type 1 through at least Type 32) based on:
  - Major cover species (dominant plants).
  - Indicator and selective species (with frequency of occurrence as a key metric).
  - Presence or absence of bare peat and water features.
  - Habitat context (peat depth, wetness, and pH ranges).
- Uses GLYPH scoring to classify types and assign types based on indicator species.
- Documents typical occurrence across islands, noting geographic constraints (e.g., some types absent from specific regions like Yell or Unst).
- Describes the ecological context for each type (erosion status, proximity to sea, streams, rocks, ditches, and other landscape features).
- Distinguishes between low, average, and high heterogeneity and provides average species complements for each type.

## The Type Catalog (examples of patterns)
- Type 1: Calluna-dominated with Cladonia species; deep, wet, acidic peat; limited coastal occurrence.
- Type 2: Drosera rotundifolia and Calluna with Sphagnum; northern/island inland distribution; deep wet peat.
- Type 3–4: Calluna-dominated with Eriophorum and associated lichens; often wet or water-adjacent habitats; diverse but with characteristic indicator sets.
- Type 5–8: Mixed Calluna communities with varying degrees of bare peat and water features; several types tied to streamsides and peat diggings.
- Type 9–12: Calluna-rich types with notable presence of Nardus stricta, Polytrichum, Sphagnum; widespread inland distribution on deep peat.
- Type 13–18: Richer species complements with various selective species; frequently linked to eroding peat, rocky outcrops, or damp shallow soils.
- Type 19–24: Maritime/coastal oriented types; associations with rock, debris soils, serpentine substrates, and damp/shallow soils; high pH ranges in some cases.
- Type 25–32: Grass-dominated to mixed communities with substantial bare ground or rock; management and grazing influence are often noted; distribution varies from coastal to near-rocky outcrops.

## Indicator Species and Glyph Scoring
- Indicator species are listed for each type, with scores that help classify a plot into a Type (e.g., Type 1, Type 2, etc.).
- Positive and negative indicator species, as well as “GLYPH” thresholds, determine Type assignment.
- Scoring thresholds (e.g., score ≥ a given value) lead to Type designations and reflect the ecological condition and substrate.

## Occurrence and Geographic Context
- Occurrence categories: Limited, Average, Widespread, Constant (with percentages indicating frequency across grids).
- Geographic notes indicate certain types are absent from specific islands/regions (e.g., Yell, Unst) and are often coastal or inland depending on hydrology and substrate.
- Several types are associated with specific landforms (rock outcrops, ditches, streams, peat bogs) and soil moisture regimes.

## Data Use for Monitoring and Policy
- Standardized typology enables consistent environmental health assessments over time.
- Indicator species and GLYPH scoring support objective classification, enabling trend analysis and policy evaluation.
- The documented relationships between vegetation types, soil moisture, peat depth, and pH allow integration with hydrology, soil health, and climate datasets.
- Data products (reports, maps, charts) can be generated from the type framework, with datasets stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals for accessibility.

## Practical Notes for Analysts
- ExpectOCR-like text in some sections; core structure relies on a consistent typology rather than raw figures.
- Use the major and indicator species lists to validate type classifications in field or transect data.
- Consider geographic constraints and habitat context when mapping types to time-series data, especially for coastal/island systems.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring
- The type framework provides a repeatable, data-driven basis to monitor environmental health, track policy outcomes, and compare habitat condition across time and space.
- By coupling vegetation types with soil and hydrological parameters, analysts can robustly assess peatland condition, biodiversity indicators, and habitat integrity in monitoring programs.
