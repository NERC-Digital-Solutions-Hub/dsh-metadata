# Survey of the terrestrial habitats and vegetation of Shetland, 1974

- Overview
  - A terrestrial survey of Shetland's vegetation, soils, and habitats conducted in 1974.
  - Part of a larger project to assess Shetland’s environment and monitor change, informing environmental impact considerations of oil-related developments.
  - Aimed to provide a user guide to defined vegetation types and a structural basis for future monitoring.
  - Data management and documentation credited to C. Wood, C. Hallam, and D. Caffrey; originator R.G.H. Bunce.

- Data Content and Geographic Scope
  - Geographic coverage: Shetland Isles, Scotland (Scotland, Shetland).
  - Time period: 1974.
  - Data categories include vegetation (vascular plants, bryophytes, macro-lichens), soils (horizon depths, pH), and habitat data (within plot and within 50 m surrounding area).

- Sampling Design and Survey Methods
  - Stratified sampling across the entire area based on 150 attributes from 1 km^2 map units, yielding 16 strata.
  - Within each stratum, 5 x 1 km^2 units randomly selected; each 1 km^2 subdivided into 16 sub-squares; a 200 m^2 plot randomly sampled per sub-square (1–16 plots per 1 km^2, depending on accessibility).
  - Total planned plots: 927; actual surveyed: 911 (some inaccessible or in crop fields).
  - Survey methods follow Bunce & Shaw (1973) standardized ecological survey procedures; detailed methods provided in the Shetland Vegetation Survey Handbook (unpublished, Merlewood).

- Data Types and Measurement Details
  - Vegetation Data: nested quadrat system (4 m^2; 25 m^2; 50 m^2; 100 m^2; 200 m^2); recording of all vascular plants, bryophytes, and macro-lichens with percent cover (bands such as 5%, 1%, few).
  - Soil Data: horizon classification; shallow central pit and auger samples to describe horizons; top 10 cm collected for pH analysis in the field.
  - Habitat Data: within-plot and within-50 m surrounding plot; includes slope and aspect measurements; predefined habitat categories with detailed definitions.
  - Data Attributes: species lists (Appendix II), soil horizon descriptions, pH, slope, aspect, litter/rock/bare ground/ water presence, and other cover data.

- Data Files and Metadata
  - SHETLAND_SURVEY_PLOT_DATA.csv: descriptions for soil, plot habitat, and habitats within 50 m of each plot (site codes, plot numbers, codes/descriptions, year 1974).
  - SHETLAND_SURVEY_PLOT_INFO.csv: detailed plot-level measurements (strata, sub-strata, plot, slope, aspect, litter/organic/mixed horizon depths, soil pH, etc.).
  - SHETLAND_SURVEY_GROUND_FLORA.csv: species list per nested plot with cover percentages, year, nest, species code, and field sheet reference.
  - Appendix I and II provide plot codes and the full species list, respectively (privacy note applies to precise square locations).

- Provenance, Documentation, and References
  - Primary references include Bunce & Shaw (1973), Bunce & Bassett (2015) on land classification, Bunce (1974) handbook, and related monitoring reports (1975).
  - Additional plant and bryophyte nomenclature references listed in the dataset documentation.

- Access, Privacy, and Data Stewardship
  - Precise locations of survey squares are confidential to protect landowner privacy; survey squares are representative samples of wider land classes.
  - Locations and sample details are described as representative rather than exact coordinates; further context and classification are available in Bunce & Bassett (2015).

- Data Management and Ownership
  - Originator: R.G.H. Bunce (Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Merlewood).
  - Field survey team and data management contributions acknowledged.
  - The dataset is supported by a formal metadata framework and historical field methods (Bunce & Shaw, 1973).

- Related Materials and Potential Uses
  - Related datasets and publications include Shetland Coastal and Freshwater Surveys (Milner, 1975) and ongoing environmental monitoring reports.
  - Potential uses for data leaders:
    - Establishing a vegetation- and habitat-based baseline for change detection over time.
    - Informing environmental impact assessments and policy planning for coastal and inland habitats.
    - Supporting cross-walks with contemporary land classification and habitat types (as per Bunce & Bassett 2015).
    - Assessing data quality, gaps, and metadata needs for long-term data stewardship.

- Limitations and Considerations
  - Some plots were inaccessible or excluded due to agricultural activities; total surveyed plots (911) may affect stratified analyses.
  - Precise plot locations are withheld to protect privacy, which may influence spatial analyses requiring exact geolocation.
  - The dataset uses specific 1970s field methodologies; compatibility with modern methods should account for methodological changes when integrating with newer datasets.

- Key Takeaways for Data Leaders
  - The Shetland 1974 survey provides a robust, methodically documented baseline of vegetation, soils, and habitats across stratified strata, with detailed field methods and multiple data layers.
  - It exemplifies a comprehensive data asset with clear data products, metadata, and privacy considerations, suitable for aggregation, re-use, and longitudinal change analysis within a governed data ecosystem.
