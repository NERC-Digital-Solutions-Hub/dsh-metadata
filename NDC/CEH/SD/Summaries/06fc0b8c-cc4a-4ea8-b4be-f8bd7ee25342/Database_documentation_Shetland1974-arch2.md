# Survey of the terrestrial habitats and vegetation of Shetland, 1974

- Purpose and scope
  - Ground component of a broader project assessing Shetland’s natural environment to inform environmental impact assessments (e.g., oil exploration) and to form a basis for monitoring vegetation change over time.
  - Objectives: (i) describe variation in vegetation and define habitat types; (ii) provide a structural basis for long-term vegetation monitoring.

- Sampling design
  - Area: Shetland Islands, Scotland; time period: 1974.
  - Stratified sampling across the entire area, based on a map study with 150 attributes per 1 km2.
  - Resulted in 16 strata; in each stratum, 5 x 1 km2 units were randomly selected.
  - Each 1 km2 unit split into 16 sub-squares; within each sub-square, a 200 m2 plot was randomly selected (for a total of up to 16 plots per 1 km2). If the random point fell in water, that sub-square was omitted.
  - Total plots: 927 selected; 911 actually surveyed (some inaccessible or in crop fields).

- Survey methods and data collection
  - Vegetation data
    - Nested quadrat system: data collected from 4 m2, 25 m2, 50 m2, 100 m2, and full 200 m2 quadrats.
    - All vascular plants, bryophytes, and macro-lichens recorded; percentage cover estimated in bands (5%, 1%, few).
  - Soil data
    - Soil typed by horizon using standardized categories; centre of each plot excavated to observe surface layers; auger samples for lower horizons.
    - Top 10 cm samples sent for pH analysis (field pH measured with a field meter).
  - Habitat data
    - Within-plot and within-50 m surrounding area recorded for habitat types; slope and aspect measured (clino/ Silva compass).
  - Parameters collected
    - Ground flora: species name, code, % cover; additional cover/abundance data (litter, rock, bare ground, water, bryophytes).
    - Soil: horizon depths, horizon descriptions, pH, and related horizon data (as per field handbook).
    - Habitat: slope, aspect; habitat types inside plot and within 50 m outside plot.
  - Field procedures and quality control
    - Methods align with Bunce & Shaw (1973) standardized survey procedures; detailed in the Shetland Vegetation Survey: Handbook of Field Methods (unpublished, ITE Merlewood).
    - Data entries include field sheet identifiers and plot coding to preserve provenance.

  - Note: Precise locations of survey squares are withheld to protect landowner privacy; squares are representative samples of Land Classes.

- Data provenance and management
  - Originator: R.G.H. Bunce, Woodlands Research Section, Institute of Terrestrial Ecology - Merlewood; field survey team listed.
  - Data management and documentation: C. Wood, C. Hallam, D. Caffrey.
  - Original purpose and subsequent references:
    - Part of Shetland project monitoring; field methods documented in Bunce (1974) and Bunce & Shaw (1973).
    - Related publications include 1975 monitor reports and later overview work (e.g., Bunce et al., 2015).

- Confidentiality and dissemination
  - To preserve representativeness and landowner privacy, exact survey square locations are kept confidential by CEH.
  - Data are linked to a standardized environmental monitoring framework suitable for documenting habitat types, vegetation variation, and change over time.

- Key personnel and references
  - Field surveyors: Bunce, Bassett, Morrell, Heap, Hambrey, Caird, etc.; data management by Wood, Hallam, Caffrey.
  - Core references: Bunce & Shaw (1973) on standardized ecological survey procedure; Bunce (1974) Shetland Vegetation Survey: Handbook of Field Methods; Milner (1975) Shetland project monitoring report; Bunce & Bassett (2015) Land Classification of Shetland 1974.
