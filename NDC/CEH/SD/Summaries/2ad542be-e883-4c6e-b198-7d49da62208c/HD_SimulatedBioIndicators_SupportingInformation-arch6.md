# Simulated Monthly Biological Indicators for England and Wales 1964-2012

- Context: Part of the Historic Droughts project (2014-2018) aiming to understand past droughts in the UK across hydrometeorological, environmental, regulatory, and social dimensions; multi-institution collaboration; goal to improve drought management tools.
- Aim of dataset: Investigate how three biological indicators respond to river discharge, using simulated, de-trended, and de-seasonalised time series.
- Biological indicators:
  - Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT)
  - LIFE at Family level (LIFE_F)
  - LIFE at Species level (LIFE_S)
- Data provenance:
  - Observations sourced from Environment Agency BIOSYS (England), circa 2011-2012 subset from the biosys database; BIOSYS data are the basis for the indicators.
  - Discharge represented by the Standardised Streamflow Index (SSI), tailored for drought studies (SSI6, 6-month accumulation).
- Study design and sampling:
  - Raw indicator data are twice-yearly, from seasonal sampling (Autumn and Spring) at 86 bio-monitoring sites matched to 76 EA gauging stations.
  - Time period of data: approx. 1950s onward with ~1984-2011 available for the indicators; output dataset covers 1964-2012.
  - Seasonal and long-term trends exist (e.g., an overall positive annual trend in biological indicators); data are detrended and deseasonalised before modelling.
- Data processing steps:
  - De-trending and de-seasonalising: fitted linear models per site with season and year as predictors; residuals (detrended/deseasonalised values) used for analysis.
  - SSI6 computation: standardised streamflow index with a 6-month accumulation; based on Tweedie distribution to fit UK river flow data.
  - Predictor set: SSI6 for the sampling month plus six 6-month lagged SSI6 values (6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 months prior).
  - Modelling approach: three multi-level (ML) models (one per bio-indicator) with two levels (data level and site level); Multi-Model Inference (MMI) to average across a set of good models rather than selecting a single best model.
  - Output: final simulated, de-trended, and de-seasonalised time series for ASPT, LIFE_F, and LIFE_S covering 1964-2012.

- Outputs detail:
  - DTDS_* columns: de-trended and de-seasonalised indicators for each bio-index (DTDS_ASPT, DTDS_LIFE_F, DTDS_LIFE_S) as dependent variables in the models.
  - MOD_* columns: modelled (simulated) outputs corresponding to each de-trended/de-seasonalised indicator (MOD_ASPT, MOD_LIFE_F, MOD_LIFE_S).
  - SSI6 and lagged SSI6 values serve as predictors for the modelling of each indicator.
