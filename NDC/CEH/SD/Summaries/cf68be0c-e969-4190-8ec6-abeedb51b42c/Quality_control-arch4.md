# Quality Control

- Standard sense checking was applied throughout the data analysis process to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Example of careful data transfer: values from fieldwork notes to digital format were double checked (e.g., floral unit widths).
- Training set settings were double checked before using a training set to train a classification model.
- Accuracy assessment values included in the .csv spreadsheets were also double checked to verify reliability.
