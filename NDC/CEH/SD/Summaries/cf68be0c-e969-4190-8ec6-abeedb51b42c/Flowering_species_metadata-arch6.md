# Flowering Species Metadata

## Purpose
- Metadata to accompany the Table_flowering_species.csv file.

## Spreadsheet columns / Fields
- Date of image acquisition: Date acquired imagery for each month at both 3cm and 7cm resolutions.
- Dates gathered ground-truth location data: Date range in which gathered ground-truth data for margin species, i.e. location data for individual floral units and floral unit measurements (see 'Floral_unit_data.csv')
- Location: margin or hedgerow species
- Flowering plant species (Latin name and common name): Latin name and common name of each flowering plant species of interest and that was included as a classification category within classification training sets.
- Nectar sucrose secretion rate (µg): Nectar sucrose secretion rate per floral unit per day (µg). This is the mean nectar sucrose per flower from Baude et al. (2015a) multiplied by the mean number of flowers per floral unit from Baude et al. (2015b). The term floral 'unit' uses Carvell et al. (2007) definition.
