- Overview
  - Imagery collected at a farm in Northamptonshire, UK on 14–15 May 2019.
  - Spatial resolutions: 3 cm and 7 cm.
  - Platforms and sensors: Hasselblad A6D-100c (50 mm) cameras mounted on a Sky Arrow 650 aircraft.
  - Data format: 16-bit orthomosaic.
  - Coordinate reference system: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).

- Data products and bands
  - 4-band imagery (blue, green, red, infrared) corresponding to B0–B3 for classification-ready data.
  - 6-band data available for the May acquisitions (original spectral information per band).
  - Clipped 4-band images provided for classification at both resolutions.
