# July Image Metadata

- Purpose and scope
  - Metadata for July imagery used to map nectar-rich floral resources for pollinators.
  - Acquisition date: 4 July 2019; location: farm in Northamptonshire, UK.
  - Platform and sensor: Hasselblad A6D-100c (50 mm) cameras on a Sky Arrow 650 aircraft.
  - Data type: 16-bit orthomosaic with OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG 27700).

- Datasets and formats
  - July_3cm: TIFF, clipped 4-band (blue B0, green B1, red B2, infrared B3) image for classifications.
  - 04_07_2019_6_Band_3: TIFF, original 3 cm, 6-band image; detailed band data in Table_band_data.
  - July_7cm: TIFF, clipped 4-band 7 cm image for classifications (related 7_BIL file: 04_07_2019_6_Band_7_BIL).
  - Original 7 cm 6-band image exists; band-specific data provided in Table_band_data within the main Mapping nectar-rich floral resources for pollinators folder.

- Band information
  - 4-band clips use B0–B3 corresponding to blue, green, red, and infrared.
  - 6-band originals include additional bands; exact band definitions available in Table_band_data.

- Geographic and technical details
  - Location: Northamptonshire farm, UK.
  - Coordinate reference system: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG 27700).
  - Resolutions available: 3 cm and 7 cm.
  - Data format and structure emphasize provenance (sensor, platform, acquisition date) and explicit band definitions.

- Governance and data use considerations
  - Metadata references the main folder for band data (Table_band_data), supporting reproducibility.
  - Clear provenance aids monitoring workflows and data quality assessment.
  - Information on data sharing or access controls is not specified; reliance on metadata completeness and dataset originators is noted.
