# July Image Metadata

## Overview
- Metadata describing July imagery captured for mapping nectar-rich floral resources for pollinators, including 3 cm and 7 cm resolution data from a farm in Northamptonshire, UK.

## Acquisition details
- Location: Farm in Northamptonshire, UK
- Date of flight: 4 July 2019
- Imagery platform and sensors: Hasselblad A6D-100c (50 mm lens) cameras with Bayer filters mounted on a Sky Arrow 650 aircraft
- Image properties: 16-bit orthomosaic
- Coordinate reference system: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG: 27700)

## Coordinate reference and data format
- All imagery is stored as TIFFs
- Bands and data are referenced against Table_band_data in the main folder “Mapping nectar-rich floral resources for pollinators”

## Data files
- July_3cm: TIFF file with clipped 4-band 3 cm resolution image used for classifications
  - Bands: blue (B0), green (B1), red (B2), infrared (B3)
- 04_07_2019_6_Band_3: TIFF file containing original 3 cm data for July across 6 bands
- July_7cm: TIFF file containing clipped 4-band 7 cm resolution image used for classifications
  - Bands: blue (B0), green (B1), red (B2), infrared (B3)
- 04_07_2019_6_Band_7_BIL: TIFF file containing original 7 cm data for July across 6 bands

## Band information
- 4-band classifications (applied to both 3 cm and 7 cm clipped images) use:
  - B0 = blue
  - B1 = green
  - B2 = red
  - B3 = infrared
- Individual band data for all files is documented in Table_band_data within the main folder

## Notes
- The 3 cm and 7 cm datasets provide both clipped classification-ready images and original multi-band datasets for July, enabling cross-resolution analyses.
