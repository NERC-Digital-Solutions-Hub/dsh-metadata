# Definitions

- Edge pixels: Pixels gathered at the edge of floral unit clusters or in the centre of small clusters where the pixel appears mixed with other features.
- Pure pixels: Pixels gathered further into the centre of floral unit clusters that are less likely to be mixed with other features.
- Other category: The classification category containing regions of interest not belonging to the focal flowering plant species (e.g., branches, soil, green vegetation, etc.).

## Training pixels

- July_train_other: 'Other' category training data for maximum likelihood classifications; used to train both the 3cm and 7cm classifications; provided as a shapefile with polygons representing 'other' pixels.
- July_train_cent_pure: Centaurea nigra (common knapweed) training data for maximum likelihood classifications; used to train both the 3cm and 7cm classifications; provided as a shapefile with polygons representing 'pure' centaurea nigra pixels.
- July_train_cent_edge: Centaurea nigra training data for maximum likelihood classifications; used to train both the 3cm and 7cm classifications; provided as a shapefile with polygons representing 'edge' centaurea nigra pixels.
- July_train_rubus_pure: Rubus fruticosus (bramble) training data for maximum likelihood classifications; used to train both the 3cm and 7cm classifications; provided as a shapefile with polygons representing 'pure' rubus fruticosus pixels.
- July_train_rubus_edge: Rubus fruticosus training data for maximum likelihood classifications; used to train both the 3cm and 7cm classifications; provided as a shapefile with polygons representing 'edge' Rubus fruticosus pixels.
