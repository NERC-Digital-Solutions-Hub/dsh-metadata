# Floral Unit Metadata

- Metadata to accompany the Floral_unit_data.csv file, documenting data collected from two field margins within the same field.
- Data collection context:
  - Silene dioica data gathered in May 2019 to align with May aerial imagery.
  - Centaurea nigra data gathered in July 2019 to align with July aerial imagery.
  - Data cover two floral units across field margins, with measurements intended to support linkage to imagery.

## Spreadsheet columns (data fields)

- Weather: Weather conditions noted several times throughout the day prior to data collection for each floral unit.
- Date: Date on which floral unit data were gathered.
- Time: Time noted several times during the day prior to data collection for each floral unit.
- Species: Silene dioica or Centaurea nigra.
- Unit: The survey floral unit; for Centaurea nigra it is one capitulum, for Silene dioica it is one or multiple flowers within the same pixel space.
- Orientation: Position relative to the ground of each flower/bud (S. dioica) or capitulum (C. nigra).
- TB_width_cm: Width (in centimetres) of the floral unit taken in the direction of travel of the margin.
- LR_width_cm: Width (in centimetres) of the floral unit taken from left to right when facing the unit in the direction of travel of the margin.
- Individual_flower: Only relevant for Silene dioica; 'Yes' indicates a single flower within the floral unit, 'No' indicates multiple flowers/buds within the unit.
