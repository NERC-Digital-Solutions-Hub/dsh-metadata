# Floral Unit Metadata

## Scope and purpose
- Metadata accompanying Floral_unit_data.csv.
- Floral unit data collected across two field margins within the same field.
- May 2019 data for Silene dioica aligned with May aerial imagery; July 2019 data for Centaurea nigra aligned with July imagery.

## Data collection overview
- Weather: Recorded for each floral unit in consecutive order; weather noted several times during the day prior to data collection for the unit.
- Date: Date of floral unit data collection.
- Time: Time noted multiple times throughout the day prior to collecting data for each unit.
- Species: Silene dioica or Centaurea nigra.
- Unit: The surveyed floral unit. For Centaurea nigra, one capitulum; for Silene dioica, one or multiple flowers within the same pixel space (on a central main stalk).
- Orientation: Position of each flower/bud (S. dioica) or capitulum (C. nigra) relative to the ground.
- TB_width_cm: Width of the floral unit in the direction of travel of the field margin.
- LR_width_cm: Width of the floral unit left-to-right when facing the unit in the direction of travel.
- Individual_flower: Only relevant for Silene dioica. "Yes" means a single flower within the unit; "no" indicates multiple flowers/buds within the unit.

## Temporal and spatial context
- Two field margins within the same field provide the spatial context for the data.
- Species-specific timing links to corresponding aerial imagery: May imagery for Silene dioica and July imagery for Centaurea nigra.

## Data quality, accessibility, and usage
- Data are organized with clear, standardized fields to support reproducibility and integration with aerial imagery.
- Metadata supports verification, quality assurance, and transformation of raw observations into standardized outputs (e.g., maps, charts) for environmental monitoring and policy performance assessment.
- Aimed at enabling access to underlying data and enhancing the value of the dataset for monitoring biodiversity-related indicators.
