# Quality Control

- Standard sense checking is applied throughout the data analysis process to ensure data integrity and reliability.
- Values transferred from fieldwork notes to digital formats are double checked (e.g., floral unit widths) to prevent transcription errors.
- Training set settings are double checked before using them to train a classification model.
- Accuracy assessment values included in CSV spreadsheets are also double checked to ensure correct evaluation reporting.
