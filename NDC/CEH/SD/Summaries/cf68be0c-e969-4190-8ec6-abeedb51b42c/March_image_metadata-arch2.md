# March Image Metadata

## Overview
- Metadata for March imagery used to map nectar-rich floral resources for pollinators.
- Imagery collected on 28 March 2019 at a farm in Northamptonshire, UK.
- Resolutions: 3 cm and 7 cm.
- Sensor: Hasselblad A6D-100c (50 mm) cameras.
- Platform: Sky Arrow 650 manned aircraft.
- Data type: 16-bit orthomosaic.
- Coordinate Reference System: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).

## Data Capture Details
- High-resolution imagery intended for classification and habitat/resource mapping.
- Data prepared in standard formats to support reproducible analyses and reporting.

## Data Files and Content
- March_3cm.tif: clipped 4-band 3 cm image used for classifications (bands B0 blue, B1 green, B2 red, B3 infrared).
- 28_03_2019_6_Band_3.tif: original 3 cm data across 6 bands.
- March_7cm.tif: clipped 4-band 7 cm image used for classifications (bands B0 blue, B1 green, B2 red, B3 infrared).
- 28_03_2019_6_Band_7_BIL.tif: original 7 cm data across 6 bands.
- Table_band_data: referenced for individual band data details; located in the main folder “Mapping nectarrich floral resources for pollinators.”

## Coordinate Reference System
- All imagery aligned to OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).

## Data Use and Organization
- Files are organized for classification workflows and subsequent mapping of nectar-rich floral resources.
- Clipped 4-band images are intended for classification outputs; original 6-band files provide full spectral information.
- Data is stored under the main folder “Mapping nectarrich floral resources for pollinators,” with per-band data documented in Table_band_data.

## Notes for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Standardized, high-resolution imagery supports consistent environmental health assessments and policy performance evaluation over time.
- The combination of clipped (for classification) and original (for validation) datasets enables robust monitoring of pollinator floral resources.
- Ensure proper linkage to the Table_band_data for band definitions when reusing or reprocessing the data.
