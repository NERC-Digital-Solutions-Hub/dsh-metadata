# Flowering Species Metadata

## Overview
- Metadata for the Table_flowering_species.csv used to characterize flowering plant resources relevant for environmental health monitoring.
- Captures temporal and spatial data collection, species identification, and nectar resource measures.
- Supports assessment of pollinator forage resources and informs monitoring efforts and decision-making.

## Spreadsheet columns details
- Date of image acquisition: Date acquired imagery for each month at both 3 cm and 7 cm resolutions.
- Dates gathered ground-truth location data: Date range in which gathered ground-truth data for margin species, i.e. location data for individual floral units and floral unit measurements (see 'Floral_unit_data.csv').
- Location: margin or hedgerow species.
- Flowering plant species (common name): Latin name and common name of each flowering plant species of interest and that was included as a classification category within classification training sets.
- Nectar sucrose secretion rate (µg): Nectar sucrose secretion rate per floral unit per day (µg). This is the mean nectar sucrose per flower from Baude et al. (2015a) multiplied by the mean number of flowers per floral unit from Baude et al. (2015b). The term floral 'unit' uses Carvell et al. (2007) definition whereby any flower or stem with multiple flowers that a bee can walk rather than fly between constitutes one unit.
