# Floral Unit Metadata

## Overview
- Metadata accompanying Floral_unit_data.csv.
- Floral unit data collected from two field margins within the same field.
- Species: Silene dioica (collected May 2019) and Centaurea nigra (collected July 2019) to align with corresponding aerial imagery (May and July).

## Data Collection Details
- Weather: Recorded for each floral unit multiple times during the day prior to data gathering.
- Date: Date of data collection for each floral unit.
- Time: Time(s) recorded for each floral unit, noted in the spreadsheet in consecutive order.
- Data collected in a sequence, with weather and timing tied to each unit.

## Spreadsheet Columns and Definitions
- Species: Silene dioica or Centaurea nigra.
- Unit: The survey floral unit (one capitulum for Centaurea nigra or one or multiple flowers within the same pixel space for Silene dioica).
- Orientation: Position relative to the ground for each flower/bud (S. dioica) or capitulum (C. nigra).
- TB_width_cm: Width of the floral unit in the direction of travel of the field margin (in cm).
- LR_width_cm: Width of the floral unit from left to right when facing the unit (in cm).
- Individual_flower: Relevant only for Silene dioica; 'Yes' if there is a single flower within the unit, 'No' if multiple flowers/buds are present.

## Context and Use
- The metadata supports mapping and analysis of floral units in GIS by documenting measurement details, timings, and orientation.
- Aligns floral unit data with high-resolution aerial imagery collected in May and July for the respective species.
