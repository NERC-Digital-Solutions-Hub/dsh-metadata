# March Image Metadata

## Overview
- Imagery collected on 28 March 2019 at a farm in Northamptonshire, UK.
- Resolutions: 3 cm and 7 cm.
- Sensor: Hasselblad A6D-100c (50 mm) cameras with Bayer filters.
- Platform: Sky Arrow 650 manned aircraft.
- Data characteristics: 16-bit orthomosaic with coordinate reference system OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).

## Data Files and Descriptions
- March_3cm.tif: clipped 4-band 3 cm resolution image used for classifications.
  - Bands: blue, green, red, infrared (B0, B1, B2, B3).
  - Band data details available in Table_band_data in the main folder “Mapping nectarrich floral resources for pollinators.”
- 28_03_2019_6_Band_3.tif: original 3 cm data for March across 6 bands (Table_band_data referenced for individual bands).
- March_7cm.tif: clipped 4-band 7 cm resolution image used for classifications.
  - Bands: blue, green, red, infrared (B0, B1, B2, B3).
- 28_03_2019_6_Band_7_BIL.tif: original 7 cm data for March across 6 bands (Table_band_data referenced for individual bands).

## Band Information
- 4-band images (March_3cm.tif and March_7cm.tif) use bands B0 (blue), B1 (green), B2 (red), B3 (infrared).
- 6-band originals (28_03_2019_6_Band_3.tif and 28_03_2019_6_Band_7_BIL.tif) contain six spectral bands; exact band definitions are provided in Table_band_data.

## Coordinate Reference and Projections
- All imagery uses OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).

## Data Usage and Documentation
- The 4-band clipped images are ready-to-use for classifications; the 6-band originals provide deeper spectral detail for advanced analysis.
- Band-specific data details are documented in Table_band_data located in the main folder “Mapping nectarrich floral resources for pollinators.”
- These datasets are suitable for exploring nectarrich floral resources for pollinators and related analyses.
