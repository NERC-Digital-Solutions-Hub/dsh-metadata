# May Image Metadata

## Overview
- Imagery acquired at a farm in Northamptonshire, UK on 14–15 May 2019 at 3 cm and 7 cm spatial resolutions.
- Platform: Sky Arrow 650 manned aircraft; sensor: Hasselblad A6D-100c (50 mm) with Bayer filters.
- Outputs: 16-bit orthomosaic with coordinate reference system OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).

## Data products and file references
- May_3cm: TIFF clipped 4-band 3 cm resolution image used for classifications (bands correspond to B0–B3: blue, green, red, infrared). See Table_band_data in the main "Mapping nectar-rich floral resources for pollinators" folder.
- 14_05_2019_6_Band_3: TIFF with original 3 cm data for May across 6 bands; band data in Table_band_data.
- May_7cm: TIFF containing original 7 cm data; 14_05_2019_6_Band_7_BIL (6-band image for May).
- 7 cm imagery: TIFF with clipped 4-band 7 cm resolution image used for classifications (bands B0–B3: blue, green, red, infrared); see Table_band_data for details.
- The original 7 cm 6-band image for May: available; band details in Table_band_data.

## Bands and band data
- 4-band subsets used for classifications: blue (B0), green (B1), red (B2), infrared (B3).
- Original datasets include 6-band and 7-band configurations; exact band definitions are provided in Table_band_data within the main folder.

## Storage and organization
- All data are stored in the Mapping nectar-rich floral resources for pollinators folder.
- Band data specifics are documented in Table_band_data.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring analysts
- Provides provenance, sensor, resolutions, and standardized CRS necessary for consistent environmental health assessments over time.
- Clear file naming and band mappings support reproducibility, data quality assurance, and integration into monitoring portals or dashboards.

## Practical considerations for analysts
- Ensure consistency of CRS (EPSG: 27700) across time series analyses.
- Align classification tasks with the appropriate band sets (4-band 3 cm or 4-band 7 cm images) and reference Table_band_data for exact band definitions.
- Maintain linkage to the "Mapping nectar-rich floral resources for pollinators" folder structure for dataset context and metadata.
