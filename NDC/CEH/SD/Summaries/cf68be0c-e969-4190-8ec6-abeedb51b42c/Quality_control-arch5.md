# Quality Control

- What was done
  - Standard sense checking applied throughout the data analysis process
  - Double checking of values when transferring from fieldwork notes to digital form (e.g., floral unit widths)
  - Training set settings double checked before using to train a classifier
  - Accuracy assessment values in CSV spreadsheets double checked

- Why this matters for Data Stewards
  - Ensures data accuracy and consistency across collection, digitization, and analysis
  - Supports reliable data sharing, reuse, and governance through verifiable quality checks
  - Enhances traceability and confidence in datasets ready for publication or further use
