# Quality Control

## Key Practices
- Standard sense checking used throughout the data analysis process to ensure integrity.
- Fieldwork-to-digital transfers are double-checked, including values such as floral unit widths.
- Training set settings are double-checked before using a training set to train a classifier.
- Accuracy assessment values included in CSV spreadsheets are double-checked.

## Relevance to Environmental Monitoring Analysts
- These quality control steps support reliable, comparable environmental data outputs necessary for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- They reflect a standardised, verifiable workflow, aligning with analysts’ roles in verification, cleaning, transforming, and presenting data outputs.
