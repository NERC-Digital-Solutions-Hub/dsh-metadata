# Quality Control

- Purpose: Describes quality control measures used throughout data analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
- Data transfer integrity: Values transferred from fieldwork notes to digital formats were double checked to prevent transcription errors (e.g., floral unit widths).
- Data preparation and modeling: Training set settings were double checked before using a training set to train a classification model.
- Model evaluation: Accuracy assessment values included in CSV spreadsheets were also double checked to verify reported performance.
- Relevance for monitoring frameworks: Emphasizes systematic quality checks to support trustworthy datasets for environmental health monitoring, aligning with needs for clear metadata, data governance, transparency, and reproducibility.
