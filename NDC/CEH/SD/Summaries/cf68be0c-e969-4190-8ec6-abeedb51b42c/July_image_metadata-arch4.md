# July Image Metadata

## Overview
- Imagery acquired at a farm in Northamptonshire, UK on 4 July 2019 at 3 cm and 7 cm spatial resolutions.
- Captured with Hasselblad A6D-100c (50 mm) cameras fitted with Bayer filters, mounted on a Sky Arrow 650 manned aircraft.
- Each image is a 16-bit orthomosaic with coordinate reference system OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG:27700).

## Data Files and Bands
- July_3cm: TIFF file with clipped 4-band 3 cm resolution image used for classifications. Bands are blue, green, red and infrared (B0, B1, B2, B3). Band data described in Table_band_data in the main "Mapping nectar-rich floral resources for pollinators" folder.
- 04_07_2019_6_Band_3: TIFF containing the original 3 cm data for July across 6 bands.
- July_7cm: TIFF file containing the original 7 cm data for July across 6 bands (04_07_2019_6_Band_7_BIL).
- 04_07_2019_6_Band_7_BIL: TIFF containing the original 7 cm data across 6 bands.
- The original 7 cm 6-band image for July, with individual band data described in Table_band_data in the main folder.

## Data Formats and Organization
- Data available in TIFF and BIL formats.
- Contains clipped (classification-ready) 3 cm data and original 3 cm/7 cm data across multiple bands (4-band and 6-band datasets).
- Band-specific information is provided in a separate Table_band_data to aid discovery and use.

## Spatial Reference and Projection
- Coordinate reference system: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG:27700).

## Usage Context and Access
- Part of the "Mapping nectar-rich floral resources for pollinators" project folder, providing detailed metadata to support data discovery, classification workflows, and data provenance.
- The Table_band_data reference indicates where to find per-band data details for all imagery bands.
