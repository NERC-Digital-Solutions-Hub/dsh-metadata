# Quality Control

- Applies standard sense checking throughout the data analysis process to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.
- Example: double-checking transfers from fieldwork notes to digital data (e.g., floral unit widths) to prevent transcription errors.
- Training set preparation: double-checking training set settings before using them to train a classifier to avoid flawed models.
- Validation data: accuracy assessment values included in CSV spreadsheets are also double-checked to ensure trustworthy performance reporting.
- Relevance for Data Support: robust QC underpins dependable data products (dashboards, reports, self-serve analyses) and supports clear communication of data quality to end users, while highlighting data gaps or needs for better data creation.
