# March Classification Metadata

- All classifications were carried out using a maximum likelihood algorithm. For full methods, refer to Methods_overview.
- Definitions:
  - Edge pixels: Pixels at the edge of floral unit clusters or in the centre of small clusters where the pixel appears mixed with other features.
  - Pure pixels: Pixels deeper into the centre of floral unit clusters that are less likely to be mixed with other features.
- Training set variants:
  - March_3cm_classification1
  - March_3cm_classification2
  - Blackthorn: edge and pure pixels both included within the training set.
  - Alternative: only blackthorn pure pixels included within the training set.
