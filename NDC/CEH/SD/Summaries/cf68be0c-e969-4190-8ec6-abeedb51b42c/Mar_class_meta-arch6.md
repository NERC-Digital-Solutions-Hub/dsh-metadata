# March Classification Metadata

- Classification approach: All classifications were carried out using a maximum likelihood algorithm; full methodological details are available in the Methods_overview document.
- Key definitions:
  - Edge pixels: Pixels at the edge of floral unit clusters or at centers of small clusters where pixels appear mixed with other features.
  - Pure pixels: Pixels deeper within floral unit clusters, less likely to be mixed with other features.
- Training set variants:
  - March_3cm_classification1
  - March_3cm_classification2
  - In some variants, both blackthorn edge and pure pixels are included within the training set; in others, only blackthorn pure pixels are included.
