# Quality Control

## What it is
- Standard sense checking used throughout the data analysis process to ensure data integrity.

## Key checks and examples
- Double-checking values transferred from fieldwork notes to digital formats (e.g., floral unit widths).
- Verifying training set settings before using them to train a classifier.
- Double-checking accuracy assessment values included in CSV spreadsheets.

## Relevance to GIS workflows
- Ensures accuracy and reliability of map-based data products and visualizations.
- Supports robust spatial analyses by preventing propagation of data errors.
- Facilitates reproducibility and auditability of GIS studies.

## Practical integration for GIS specialists
- Implement validation steps during data ingestion, transformation, and cleaning.
- Document checks and maintain data provenance for transparency.
- Use automated quality checks where possible to catch inconsistencies early.
