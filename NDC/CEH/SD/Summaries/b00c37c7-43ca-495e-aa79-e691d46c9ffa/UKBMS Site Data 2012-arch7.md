# Experimental design/sampling regime

- Overview
  - UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) collects data from over 1,000 sites annually across the UK.
  - Data are gathered using multiple methods: all-species transects (Pollard walks), single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts.
  - All-species transects involve a fixed-route line transect per site, with weekly butterfly counts during the approved season, enabling year-to-year comparisons.
  - Transects are 2–4 km long, divided into habitat/management sections, typically yielding up to 26 counts per year (April–September).
  - Transects are chosen to sample habitat types and management, and must remain fixed for comparability.

- Data collection methods
  - Site location data are recorded in the field when a transect, timed count, or larval web count is established.
  - Data are entered into Transect Walker software (free download on UKBMS site) by the recorder or regional transect coordinator.
  - If a transect route changes, the new route is treated as a new site with a new site number.
  - Transect Walker files are uploaded into an Oracle database that stores all records.

- Spatial and data standards
  - Site location data include Ordnance Survey (OS) grid references, transect length (m), and the number of transect sections.
  - Grid references are broken down into Easting (x) and Northing (y) coordinates.
  - For some sites, certain data fields may be incomplete.

- Quality control
  - A regional transect coordinator validates records, leveraging local knowledge of sites.
  - After initial checks, data undergo automated and manual validation to verify location data correctness.

- Data formats and storage
  - Site Location Data are stored as CSV files.
  - Key columns include: Site number, Site name, Gridreference, Easting, Northing, Length, Country, No. Sections, No. Yrs surveyed, First year surveyed, Last year surveyed (up to 2012).

- Temporal scope
  - No. Yrs surveyed, First year surveyed, and Last year surveyed document the temporal extent of butterfly abundance data at each site (up to the year 2012 in the provided data).

- Weather and timing constraints
  - Field observations occur during suitable butterfly activity conditions.
  - All-species transects are conducted on a weekly basis during the approved season, typically within specific daily time windows and weather parameters to ensure data consistency.
