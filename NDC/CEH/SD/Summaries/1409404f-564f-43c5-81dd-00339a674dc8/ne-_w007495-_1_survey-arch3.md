Farmers' preferences for environmental land management contracts

## Purpose and scope
- Survey to identify remuneration farmers would require to host flood control measures on farmland.
- Assess willingness to participate in catchment-wide trading schemes and incentives for cooperative ecological corridors.
- Explore preferences across a series of hypothetical, policy-relevant flood management contracts and connectivity arrangements.

## Study design and methodology
- Online survey, approximately 20–30 minutes to complete.
- Hypothetical land-use decisions presented as paired choices (no deception).
- Experimental components include:
  - Eight contract questions (CE1T1–CE1T8) on natural flood management (NFM) features (type, location, land quality, size, annual payments).
  - Tradable flood mitigation scheme with trading ratios (WTA and WTP sections) to explore cross-farm NFM commitments and transaction costs.
  - Ecological connectivity scheme (NFM corridors) linking features within and across farms (widths, number of neighbours, bonuses, annual payments per 100 meters).
- Example scenario descriptions and a progression through 8 contract choice questions, followed by trading and connectivity scenarios.
- Post-survey: debrief and a payment template for participation.

## Participants and incentives
- Target respondents: farmers within a water catchment area.
- Recruitment and coordination by Durham University; independent of DEFRA.
- Participation is voluntary; no deception.
- Incentive: £50 payment via bank transfer; payout processed via BACS within about two weeks after template submission.

## Data collected and key variables
- Participant demographics:
  - Gender, year of birth, educational attainment, farming tenure.
- Farm characteristics:
  - Farm size (hectares), land ownership percentage, primary income from farming, years farming at current location, inheritance history.
- Land and production details:
  - Total land area, number of land tracts, land uses (cereals, crops, grazing, dairy, etc.), proportion of land owned.
- Farm operational context:
  - Boundary sharing with other farms, number of neighboring farms, shared equipment, AES/CSF participation, involvement in local farming groups.
- Flood risk perceptions:
  - Degree of concern about flooding on their land and across the catchment.
- Decision-context indicators:
  - Perceived usefulness of farming advice sources (neighbors, extension advisors, local groups, contractors, family).
- Contract-specific design variables:
  - Type of NFM feature (set-aside natural regeneration vs planted woodland), location (field boundary, river edge, in-field), land quality where NFM is created, size of NFM feature, annual payment per contract option.
- Tradable scheme indicators:
  - Trading ratios, transaction fees as a percentage of payment, net payments to participants, internal negotiation dynamics.
- Ecological connectivity indicators:
  - Type of corridor, number of neighbours connected with, corridor width, one-off coordination bonuses, annual payments per 100 meters.

## Data governance, ethics, and data handling
- Control and ethics:
  - GDPR-compliant data management; anonymised data; identification removed after study completion.
  - Confidentiality: information not publicly disseminated with identifying characteristics.
  - Explicit consent required; study funded by NERC and ESRC; independent of DEFRA.
- Data access and sharing:
  - Underlying data are handled to protect privacy; not released with identifying details.
  - Data management and storage specifications are aligned with consent and GDPR requirements.
- Dissemination and outputs:
  - Findings intended to inform policy design and monitoring frameworks; may be used to calibrate NFM and trading schemes.
- Payment logistics:
  - Payment processing details collected (name, address, bank details) for completing the incentive payout.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Potential monitoring indicators:
  - Uptake and distribution of NFM contracts across land types (high-risk vs low-risk).
  - Average remuneration levels farmers require for NFM participation.
  - Demand and design preferences for contract features (type, location, size, land quality).
  - Adoption and effectiveness of tradable schemes (trading ratios, transaction costs, net payments).
  - Corridor connectivity adoption (widths, number of neighbours, coordination bonuses).
  - Engagement in AES/CSF and local farming networks as proxies for governance and information flow.
- Data integration considerations:
  - Linking survey responses to farm-level attribute data (land area, ownership, land-use mix) for richer policy analysis.
  - Managing data quality and metadata gaps from originators; ensuring standardization across datasets.
  - Ensuring transparent data governance and appropriate data sharing controls to support monitoring while preserving privacy.
- Practical use:
  - Inform design of NFM contracts, payment schemes, and trading ratios to optimize uptake and environmental outcomes.
  - Support creation of dashboards and reports for policymakers evaluating policy performance and equity across farmers.

## Limitations and considerations
- Hypothetical choices may not perfectly predict real-world behavior; responses may be subject to biases.
- Self-reported farm and land-use information may require validation or supplementation with administrative data.
- Data sensitivity and governance constraints may limit public sharing; reliance on secure access for monitoring purposes.
