# CONSENT FORM

- Purpose: Survey to understand farmers' preferences for environmental land management contracts that could host flood control measures. Participants respond to a series of hypothetical land-use decisions as if real, focusing on flood risk reduction and biodiversity benefits.

- Duration and incentive: Completing the online survey takes about 20-30 minutes. Participants are paid £50 via bank transfer.

- Risks and confidentiality: No foreseeable risks. Data will be anonymised and stored securely under GDPR. Email addresses will not be linked to personal data, and identifying information removed/destroyed after the study. Data will not be publicly disseminated with identifying details.

- Participation and deception: Participation is voluntary; participants may withdraw at any time. The study states there is no deception.

- Consent process: Participants indicate consent or non-consent to participate.

- Governance and funding: Part of a PhD project funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), independent of DEFRA or other government agencies.

- What this study investigates:
  - Level of remuneration farmers would require to allocate land to natural flood management (NFM).
  - Willingness to participate in a catchment-wide trading scheme where high-risk land owners fund NFM on low-risk land.
  - Financial incentives for cooperative schemes linking neighboring farms to create ecological corridors or connect NFM features.

- What data will be collected:
  - Personal and farm information: gender, birth year, education, farming history, land area, land ownership, primary household income source, land tenure, past inheritance, and household income distribution from farming.
  - Farm structure and land-use: number of tracts, land uses (cereals, cropping, grazing, pigs/poultry, horticulture, dairy, other), number of boundary-sharing farms, equipment-sharing practices, AES/CSF enrollment, and participation in local farming networks.
  - Flood-related attitudes: concern about flooding on individual land and in the catchment, and sources of farming advice.

- Survey design and key components:
  - Three main environmental schemes are explored via structured questions:
    1) Natural Flood Management (NFM) contract design:
       - Hypothetical contracts over five years (with possible extension).
       - Eight ChoiceCard-style questions (CE1T1–CE1T8) varying: type of NFM (set-aside with natural regeneration vs planted woodland), location on land (field boundary, in-field, river edge), land quality, size of NFM feature, and annual payments.
       - Example questions illustrate choices between alternate NFM configurations and compensation.
    2) Tradable Flood Mitigation Scheme:
       - Scenario where 3% of land must be enrolled to qualify for payments; trading across farms within the catchment is allowed.
       - NFM effectiveness can differ by land suitability (trading ratio). Central market with a transaction fee; 5-year contracts.
       - Twelve scenarios split into Willingness-To-Accept (WTA) and Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) blocks (WTA1–WTA6 and WTP1–WTP6) exploring fees, payments, and trading ratios (e.g., 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, etc.).
    3) Ecological Connectivity Scheme:
       - Payments for creating corridors that connect natural features within a farm and across farms.
       - Corridors must meet minimum area (0.01 ha) and width (minimum 10 m); contracts last five years with renewals; potential coordination bonuses with neighbours.
       - Eight questions (CE3T1–CE3T8) about NFM feature type, number of neighbours connected, corridor width, bonuses, and annual payments.

- Data collection format:
  - Responses to discrete choice questions (A/B options with specific attributes and payments) and contingent valuation-style questions (WTA/WTP).
  - Options are presented with concrete numbers to quantify preferences and trade-offs.

- End of survey and payment processing:
  - Participants provide bank details to receive £50; processing time is typically about two weeks.
  - A template and contact email are used to facilitate payment.

- Data use and access:
  - Data will be anonymised, stored securely, and managed in line with GDPR.
  - The study emphasizes traceable data sources and, where applicable, datasets may be made discoverable with metadata.
