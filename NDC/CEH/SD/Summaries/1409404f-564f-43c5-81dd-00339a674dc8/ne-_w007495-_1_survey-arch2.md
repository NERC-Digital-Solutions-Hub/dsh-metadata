# CONSENT FORM

- This document is a consent form for a survey on Farmers' preferences for environmental land management contracts, conducted by Durham University researchers.

## Purpose and scope
- To determine what farmers think about using their land for flood control measures that benefit the water catchment.
- Participants respond to a series of hypothetical land-use and contract choices as if making real decisions.
- Aims include understanding remuneration levels, willingness to participate in catchment-wide trading, and incentives for cooperative ecological arrangements.

## Procedures and duration
- Online survey requiring approximately 20-30 minutes.
- Participants provide information about themselves and their farm, then answer multiple hypothetical NFM (natural flood management) contract questions.
- Example questions illustrate trade-offs between NFM features, locations, land quality, size, and annual payments.

## Risks and benefits
- No foreseeable risks reported.
- Benefits include contributing to research on flood risk management and environmental land use policies.

## Incentives
- Participants are paid £50 via bank transfer for time and effort.

## Confidentiality and privacy
- All data kept confidential; email addresses are not linked to personal data.
- Demographic information limited to responses; identifying information removed and destroyed after the study ends.
- Data will be anonymised and stored with GDPR-compliant management; not publicly disseminated with identifying characteristics.

## Voluntary participation and consent
- Participation is voluntary; participants may withdraw at any time.
- Consent decisions are captured via explicit selections (I CONSENT / I DO NOT CONSENT).

## Deception
- The study will not involve deception.

## Funding and oversight
- Part of a PhD project funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); independent of DEFRA or other government agencies.

## Control questions (context and data governance)
- Clarifies funding sources, data handling, anonymisation, GDPR compliance, and the study’s focus on farming land to reduce flooding and increase biodiversity.
- Defines terms: high-risk land vs. low-risk land in terms of flood impact within the catchment.

## Key research questions (summary)
- What level of remuneration would farmers consider adequate for NFM contracts?
- Are farmers willing to participate in catchment-wide trading schemes exchanging NFM obligations across land types?
- What financial incentives would promote cooperative ecological schemes (e.g., connecting habitats across fields/farms)?

## Participant information collected
- Personal and farming background (gender, birth year, education, farming tenure, land area, land ownership, primary income source, etc.).
- Farm structure and land uses (cropping, livestock, horticulture, etc.).
- Involvement in AES or CSF schemes and regional farming networks.
- Perceived flood concerns for their land and catchment.

## Description of schemes evaluated (high-level)
- National Flood Management (NFM) scheme:
  - Pays for creating and maintaining NFM features (e.g., broadleaf woodland, natural regeneration) on farmland for five years, with potential extension.
  - Responsibilities include site development, maintenance, and periodic inspections; site selection with farmer approval.
  - Eight questions present different NFM contract options (variation in feature type, location, land quality, size, and annual payments).
- TRADABLE FLOOD MITIGATION SCHEME:
  - Hypothetical scenario where 3% of farmland must be enrolled; enables trading NFM obligations between farms.
  - Trading ratios (e.g., 5:1, 10:1) reflect relative effectiveness of NFM across land types; central market charges a transaction fee.
  - Contracts last five years and are renewable; examples illustrate cost/benefit dynamics of trading vs. on-site NFM.
  - Twelve scenarios (WTA and WTP sections) explore choices under different trading ratios, fees, and payments.
- ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY SCHEME:
  - Pays for linking natural features (NF) within and across farms via ecological corridors (e.g., hedgerows, streams).
  - Corridors have minimum size and width requirements; contracts last five years and are renewable.
  - Eight questions present options varying feature type, number of neighbours connected, corridor width, coordination bonuses, and payments per 100 meters.

## Example structure of choice questions
- CE1T1 to CE1T8: NFM contract attributes (feature type, location, land quality, size, annual payment).
- TRADABLE FLOOD MITIGATION SCHEME: WTA1–WTA6 and WTP1–WTP6 sections exploring fees, payments, and trading ratios.
- CE3Intro and CE3T1–CE3T8: Ecological connectivity choices (feature type, number of neighbours, corridor width, bonuses, and payments).
- Example and instructions emphasize choosing the preferred contract and understanding that options may not precisely match individual farm conditions.

## End of survey and payment
- Concludes with a thank-you message and a request to complete a template to receive payment via BACS.
- Participants are asked to provide contact and bank details for payment processing (approximately two weeks).

## Practical implications for environmental data monitoring
- Generates standardized, comparable data on farmer preferences regarding flood risk management contracts and ecological connectivity.
- Data can inform the design and evaluation of flood mitigation policies, catchment-based trading mechanisms, and landscape-scale biodiversity strategies.
- Aligns with data-value goals by enabling aggregation, cross-farm comparisons, and potential integration with other environmental datasets.

## Limitations and notes
- Data are based on hypothetical scenarios and self-reported preferences, which may not translate directly into real-world behavior.
- The form explicitly notes the absence of deception and ensures data privacy and GDPR compliance.
