# CONSENT FORM

- Purpose of study
  - To determine farmers' preferences for environmental land management contracts that could be used to host flood control measures and improve water catchment outcomes.
  - Investigates three primary questions: remuneration adequate to use land for natural flood management (NFM), willingness to participate in a catchment-wide trading scheme, and financial incentives for cooperative schemes linking neighboring farms.

- Participation details
  - You will be asked about yourself, your farm, and hypothetical NFM initiatives.
  - Questions are presented as choices between two alternatives, treated as if real land-use decisions.
  - Estimated completion time: ~20–30 minutes.
  - Participation is voluntary and you may withdraw at any time.

- Risks and benefits
  - Risks: none foreseeably; no video, recording, or photography in the online survey.
  - Benefits: contributes to research on land management and flood risk reduction; potential long-term policy insights.

- Incentives
  - Compensation of £50 for time and effort, paid via bank transfer to your selected account.

- Confidentiality and data handling
  - All information will be kept confidential; emails will not be linked to personal data.
  - Demographic information limited to survey responses; data will be anonymised and stored securely.
  - Data will not be publicly disseminated with identifying characteristics.
  - Data handling complies with GDPR guidelines.

- Deception and consent
  - No deception involved.
  - Your voluntary consent is required to participate. You may select:
    - I CONSENT
    - I DO NOT CONSENT

- Study governance and funding
  - Part of a PhD project at Durham University.
  - Funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); independent of DEFRA or other government agencies.

- What you will be asked to evaluate (schemes and questions)
  - CONSENT and baseline information
    - Gender, birth year, education, farming status, farm characteristics (land area, ownership, land uses, tenure, income sources).
  - Description of the Scheme (eight questions)
    - Evaluate NFM contracts featuring options such as type of NFM (set-aside natural regeneration vs planted woodland), location on land (field boundary, in-field, river edge), land quality, size of NFM feature, and annual payments.
    - Each question presents a pair of contract options; you select your preferred option.
    - Example questions illustrate variations in NFM type, location, land quality, size, and pay structure.
  - Trading and Remuneration Context (WTA/WTP sections)
    - TRADABLE FLOOD MITIGATION SCHEME: a hypothetical world where 3% of land must be enrolled; allows trading across farms with trading ratios (e.g., 5:1, 10:1) and a central market with transaction fees and annual payments.
    - Willingness-To-Accept (WTA) questions: high-risk land owners decide on compensation and trading arrangements to supply NFM on others’ land; multiple scenarios with different ratios, transaction fees, and payments.
    - Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) questions: low-risk landowners decide on payment arrangements to obtain NFM created by high-risk landowners; multiple scenarios with different ratios, fees, and payments.
  - Ecological Connectivity Scheme
    - Payment for creating ecological corridors to connect natural features within a farm and across neighboring farms.
    - Corridors must meet minimum area/width requirements; contracts last 5 years and are renewable.
    - Options vary by NFM feature type, number of neighboring farms coordinated with, corridor width, one-off coordination bonuses, and per-100-meter payments.
  - Conclusion and payment logistics
    - After survey completion, instructions are provided to submit bank details for payment processing.
    - Payment via BACS; expected processing time ~2 weeks.

- Data use and potential impact
  - Data will inform understanding of farmer preferences for NFM contracts, trading arrangements, and ecological connectivity incentives.
  - Findings could influence design of environmental land management policies and catchment-scale flood risk strategies.
