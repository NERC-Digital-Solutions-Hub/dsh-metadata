# CONSENT FORM

- Purpose and scope
  - Survey to understand farmers’ preferences for using land to host flood control measures (natural flood management, NFM) and for potential trading/cooperation schemes within a catchment.
  - Participants respond to hypothetical land-use options as if making real decisions.

- Who conducts the study
  - Investigators: Daniel J. Leppert (PhD student), Ashar Aftab, Sim M. Reany, Ric Scarpa, Durham University.
  - Contact: daniel.j.leppert@durham.ac.uk; additional contacts listed for ethics and administration.

- Participation details
  - Estimated time: about 20–30 minutes.
  - Voluntary participation; option to exit at any time.
  - No recording or video involved during the online survey.

- Risks and incentives
  - No foreseen risks.
  - Compensation: £50 paid via bank transfer; handled separately by the research team.

- Confidentiality and data handling
  - All information kept confidential; email addresses not linked to personal data; demographic data limited to survey responses.
  - Data anonymised, stored securely, GDPR-compliant.
  - Identifying information removed/destroyed after study ends; data not publicly identifiable.

- Consent
  - Participants must consent to join the study; options: I CONSENT or I DO NOT CONSENT.

- What is being studied (control questions overview)
  - Research questions focus on:
    - What remuneration would be adequate for using land for natural flood management?
    - Willingness to participate in a catchment-wide trading scheme for NFM?
    - Financial incentives to encourage cooperation between neighbouring farms for NFM or ecological corridors.
  - Study includes demographic questions and farm characteristics to understand context.

- Data collection details (types of information)
  - Personal and farm demographics: gender, year of birth, education, years farming at location, farm size, land ownership percentage, primary income from farming, etc.
  - Farm and land characteristics: land area (hectares), land uses (cereals, grazing, dairy, horticulture, etc.), number of separate tracts, number of neighboring farms, boundary sharing, involvement in AES/CSF, community involvement, concerns about flooding on farm and in catchment.
  - Contract and scheme preferences: responses to a series of choice-based questions describing NFM features, locations (e.g., river edge, in-field), land quality, size of NFM features, annual payments, and trade/transaction terms.

- Description of the schemes (schemes presented in the survey)
  - NFM contract (within-farm): create and maintain NFM features (e.g., broadleaf woodland or natural regeneration); five-year contracts with potential extension; site selection with farmer approval; maintenance responsibilities; periodic inspections.
  - Eight variation questions (CE1T1–CE1T8) exploring different NFM feature types, locations, land quality, size, and payments; options are hypothetical.
  - Tradable Flood Mitigation Scheme: imagine a world where 3% of farmland must host NFM to receive generous support; trading across farms allowed; trading ratios determine land area equivalence (e.g., 5:1, 10:1); central market with a transaction fee; contracts last five years.
  - WTA (Willingness to Accept) scenarios: six options for high-risk land where others pay to create NFM for you; include transaction fees, payments per area, and trading ratios.
  - WTP (Willingness to Pay) scenarios: six options for low-risk land where you pay others to create NFM; include transaction fees, payments, and trading ratios.
  - Ecological Connectivity Scheme: payments for connecting natural features within a farm (ecological corridors) and across farms; minimum corridor width and area; five-year contracts; potential coordination bonuses; examples provided to illustrate payments.

- GIS-relevant aspects and potential data use
  - NFM site location decisions reference land types and landscape features (river edge, field boundary), suggesting future spatial data collection on parcel boundaries, NFM sites, corridors, and connectivity.
  - Data could be linked to GIS layers such as farm boundaries, land cover, flood risk, topography, and hydrology to model catchment-level effectiveness.
  - Emphasis on standardised data collection (land use, size, location types, corridor widths) to enable integration across farms and datasets.

- Practical considerations for GIS specialists
  - Data needs and standards: consistent collection of land parcel boundaries, NFM site locations, corridor networks, and land-use classifications.
  - Resolution and aggregation: varying parcel sizes and multiple datasets; need for harmonisation across farms and catchments.
  - Privacy and governance: anonymisation and privacy-preserving handling of location and farm-specific details.
  - Integration potential: linking survey responses to spatial datasets for analysis of preferences by location, land type, and flood risk, while ensuring ethical data use.

- Contact and payment logistics
  - Final section requests participant banking details for compensation (name, address, email, bank name/address, account number, sort code).
  - Payment via BACS within approximately two weeks after receipt of details.
  - Contact for payment issues: business.financehub@durham.ac.uk.

- Ethics and governance
  - Research ethics approvals noted; independence from DEFRA; GDPR-compliant data management.
  - Deception disclosure: no deception involved.
  - Voluntary participation reaffirmed with consent options and withdrawal rights.

- Conclusion
  - The document is a consent form for a comprehensive survey on farmers’ preferences regarding environmental land management contracts, trading schemes, and ecological connectivity, with detailed demographic data collection and multiple hypothetical contract scenarios to assess willingness to participate and pay for NFM and related ecosystem services.
