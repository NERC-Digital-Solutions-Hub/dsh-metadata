# Farmers' preferences for environmental land management contracts

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to determine farmers' views on using farmland for flood control measures that benefit the water catchment.
- Uses a series of hypothetical, but treated-as-real, land-use options presented as choices between two alternatives.
- Estimated completion time: 20–30 minutes.

## Procedures and time commitment
- Participants provide information about themselves and their current farming land.
- They evaluate a sequence of hypothetical flood control initiatives and select preferred options in each pair.
- Participation is voluntary and responses are used for research on land management contracts and potential trading schemes.

## Incentives and participation
- Compensation of £50 paid via bank transfer for time and effort.
- No videotaping, recording, or photography during the online survey.

## Confidentiality and data protection
- All information kept confidential; email addresses not linked to personal data; demographic data limited to survey responses.
- Data will be anonymised and not publicly disseminated with identifiable traits.
- GDPR-compliant data management; identifying information removed and destroyed at study end.
- Participation can be withdrawn at any time without consequence.

## Consent
- Voluntary consent required to participate.
- Deception: the study states there will be no deception.
- Consent options presented: I CONSENT or I DO NOT CONSENT.

## Data to be collected (variables and measures)
- Personal and demographic information: gender, birth year, education level, farming tenure, primary income source, land ownership, years farming at current location, etc.
- Farm and land characteristics: total farm area (ha), number of separate land tracts, land use mix, boundaries with neighboring farms, sharing of equipment, involvement in AES/CSF schemes, local farming group participation.
- Land management context: level of concern about flooding on their land and in the catchment.
- Contract and scheme specifics: responses to multiple choice scenarios describing NFM (natural flood management) contracts, including location, type (set-aside with natural regeneration vs planted woodland), land quality, size of NFM features, and annual payments.
- Trading/scenario framing: for tradable flood mitigation and ecological connectivity schemes, questions cover transaction fees, payments, trading ratios (e.g., 5:1, 10:1), number of neighboring farms connected, corridor widths, and coordination bonuses.
- Final administrative data: participant contact details and bank-transfer information for payment.

## Data management and governance
- Data collection designed to support three primary research questions about remuneration, participation in catchment-wide trading, and incentives for cooperative land-use schemes.
- Structured choice experiment data (binary/multiple choice) to be stored with respondent IDs.
- Anonymised outputs intended for policy-relevant analysis and academic publication.
- Data stewardship aligned with GDPR; access controls and secure storage; de-identification prior to dissemination.

## Potential risks, benefits, and limitations
- Perceived risks: none anticipated beyond typical survey participation.
- Benefits: contributes to understanding farmer preferences for environmental land-management policies and trading mechanisms.
- Limitations: hypothetical scenarios may not fully capture real-world decision constraints; results depend on respondent understanding of complex schemes.

## Funding and oversight
- Study part of a PhD project at Durham University.
- Funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); independent of DEFRA or other government agencies.

## Contact information
- Investigators: Daniel J. Leppert (doctoral student), with Ashar Aftab, Sim M. Reany, and Prof. Ric Scarpa listed as investigators.
- Primary contact for payment processing and study administration: business.financehub@durham.ac.uk.

## Conclusion
- The survey aggregates farmer preferences across multiple hypothetical NFM and ecological connectivity contracts to inform future policy design and market-like trading mechanisms within catchments.
