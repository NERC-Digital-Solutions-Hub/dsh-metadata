# Name of datasets

- A collection of paleolimnology datasets from the LAC project, comprising seven CSV files: LAC_Ruppert_1cm_dataset.csv, LAC_Ruppert_2cm_dataset.csv, LAC_WBP_dataset.csv, LAC_Nor1_dataset.csv, LAC_Nor3_dataset.csv, LAC_AT2_1cm_dataset.csv, and LAC_AT2_2cm_dataset.csv.
- Datasets credited to a wide group of institutions (Geography and Environment, University of Southampton; UCL; University of Nottingham; Loughborough University; and collaborators in Canada and Malaysia).

- Each dataset provides multi-proxy lake core data (depth- and sample-based) from Arctic to subarctic lakes, with 1 cm or 2 cm resolution depending on the proxy and core.

- Data are intended for analysing past environmental change via correlations among proxies (geochemical, biological, isotopic, and sedimentary indicators) and for building predictive understandings of ecosystem responses.

- Data were generated through a unified laboratory workflow with cross-core consistency in sampling, subsampling, and analysis, enabling cross-site comparisons.

- The datasets support discovery and reuse through metadata-rich CSV files uploaded to data portals.

- The document also outlines the experimental design, analytical methods, data formats, quality control, and references that underpin the datasets.

- Aims of the datasets include identifying correlations among proxies, constructing running-depth profiles, and enabling subsequent modelling of past environmental changes.

- The datasets are designed for analysts seeking statistically robust patterns, multi-proxy synthesis, and reproducible analyses to inform paleoenvironmental interpretations.

- Data management emphasizes traceability, with running depths, sample IDs, and explicit units and column definitions to facilitate re-use and replication.
