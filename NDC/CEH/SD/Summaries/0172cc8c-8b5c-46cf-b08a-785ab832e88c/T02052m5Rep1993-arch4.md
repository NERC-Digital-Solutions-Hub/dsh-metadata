# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

## Overview
- First digital national land cover map for Britain since the 1960s; launched July 1993 by NERC and BNSC, with the Department of Environment as a user via Countryside 1990.
- Demonstrator project: digital mapping from Landsat TM imagery to support landscape planning and environmental decision-making.
- Map contains 25 target land cover types (recorded as 17 key classes for outputs and 9 major classes for pattern analysis); data are grid-based at 25 m cells, with a minimum accurately mappable unit around 1 ha (strong spectral features down to 0.125 ha).

## Data and Methods
- Data sources and processing
  - Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery (30 m pixel, 7 bands) used; 8 Landsat paths cover Britain; summer and winter images combined to improve classification of vegetation types.
  - Images geometrically corrected to British National Grid; co-registered across seasons to sub-pixel accuracy; six-band composite (bands 3, 4, 5 from both summer and winter) used for classification.
- Classification approach
  - Supervised maximum likelihood classification trained from extensive field reconnaissance; typically 70–80 subclasses aggregated into 25 target classes, then further into 17 key classes (and 9 major classes for pattern analyses).
  - Iterative process: initial classification, inspection, refinement of training areas, re-classification, and validation.
  - Contextual and knowledge-based corrections used to improve accuracy (notably coastal masks, urban masks, cloud/shadow/snow masks, and local corrections).
- Output preparation
  - Building a nationwide mosaic from 100 km tiles; 20 m (0.8 pixel) average displacement during correction; masking reduces misclassifications near coasts, urban areas, and water–land boundaries.
  - Post-classification filtering applied selectively (3x3 kernel) to remove isolated misclassified pixels.
- Data formats and accessibility
  - Digital Land Cover Map at ~25 m resolution; outputs include full 25-class data and 17-key-class data; 1 km summary (CIS) versions offered for broad analyses.
  - Hard-copy outputs demonstrated across major areas (London, Norfolk Broads, North York Moors, Ardnamurchan).

## Classification Scheme and Integration with Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
- Land cover classes
  - 25 target classes, aggregated to 17 key classes; these are aligned with CS1990 field surveys and related datasets; some classes are further aggregated to 9 for pattern analysis.
  - Classes cover coastal/inland water, beaches, saltmarsh, various grasslands, moorlands, heath, shrubs, woodlands (deciduous and coniferous), tilled/arable land, urban/suburban development, and inland bare ground; a small proportion remains unclassified.
- Integration with CS1990 data
  - CS1990 field surveys used stratified random sampling (508 1-km squares) with detailed ground checks (hedges, verges, ditches, ponds; plant species; etc.).
  - Field data digitised in GIS and compared with Landsat-derived maps at multiple scales:
    - Vector-to-raster (143 squares) for pixel-level comparison and 25-class alignment.
    - 2S-class LCD alignment against 59 LCDfield classes for broader compatibility.
    - 1 km grid comparisons across all squares.
  - Overall correspondence improves when accounting for different definitions and time-lag changes; direct agreement (vector-to-vector) ~46%; after considering class definitions, ~67% overall; excluding boundary pixels raises correspondence to ~71%; within-field agreement ~82%.

## GIS, Demonstrator Projects, and Applications
- Countryside Information System (CIS)
  - PC-based desktop system combining Landsat-derived data with CS1990 field data and additional thematic information; supports region definitions, masks, and region-based analyses at 1 km resolution.
  - Outputs include 1 km summaries per cover type (700x1300 data grid per dataset) enabling broad landscape analyses and planning.
- Demonstrator projects and applications
  - Pattern analyses and landscape ecology (e.g., relationship between land cover diversity and bird species diversity).
  - Habitat-specific studies (e.g., sparrowhawks and woodland habitats; radio-tracked predator movements).
  - Projections for road corridors, emissions plumes, and river catchment management.
  - The Key Habitats project demonstrating integration of Landsat cover data with other geographic datasets (soils, rivers, topography) for landscape-scale conservation planning.
  - About 40 specific applications either underway or planned across biodiversity, conservation, land-use planning, environmental chemistry, water resources, and GIS research and development.

## Data Quality, Gaps, and Challenges
- Accuracy and validation
  - Ground-truth comparisons show 67–90% correspondence depending on the level of detail and patterns considered; higher when boundaries are excluded and when time-based changes are allowed.
  - Major sources of error include mixed boundary pixels and differences in how land cover is generalized between field surveys and satellite classifications.
  - Permanent misregistration and seasonal changes (e.g., rotation farming, phenology) contribute to some discrepancies.
- Gaps and limitations
  - About 12% of Britain lacked winter data; 0.5% remained unmapped due to cloud; some upland western areas had limited data coverage.
  - Spatial resolution and class definability constraints lead to artificial quantization (25-class system) and potential misclassification of continuous vegetation gradients.
- Data management and accessibility
  - While the dataset is digital and widely accessible, the sheer volume (millions of parcels) presents GIS data handling challenges; 1 km CIS summaries offer practical, scalable alternatives for many analyses.

## Future Updates and Roadmap
- Ongoing updates and improvements planned
  - Regular updates to maintain currency; anticipated update cycles could reduce mapping time to around two-thirds of the original effort.
  - Increased automation, spectral libraries, and utilization of supplementary data (e.g., radar) to fill cloud-covered gaps.
  - Exploration of fully automated classification using spectral signatures and knowledge-based corrections; development of more refined training areas and boundary handling.
  - Enhanced registration between summer–winter composites and improved integration with Ordnance Survey boundary data for better segmentation and within-segment classification.
  - Potential addition of higher-detail classes (e.g., specific crops) where feasible and accurate.
  - Evaluation of new sensor capabilities and multi-sensor data fusion to improve spatial and spectral resolution while addressing new methodological challenges.

## Conclusions
- The Land Cover Map of Great Britain represents a major advancement in digital land-cover mapping, enabling national-scale, high-detail spatial analyses and integration with field data for informed landscape planning.
- The hierarchical 25-class system, with 17 key classes (and 9 for pattern analyses), balances consistency, interpretability, and application across diverse user groups.
- The project demonstrates the value of integrating remote-sensing data with ground-based surveys in a GIS-enabled information system (CIS), enabling broad policy, conservation, and planning uses.
- While accuracy is generally high, challenges remain in boundary delineation, cloud-affected data, temporal changes, and the need for continuous updates as land cover evolves.
- The Combined use of Landsat-derived maps and field-based data creates a robust knowledge base for monitoring, planning, and decision support, with substantial ongoing and planned applications across government, research, and industry.
