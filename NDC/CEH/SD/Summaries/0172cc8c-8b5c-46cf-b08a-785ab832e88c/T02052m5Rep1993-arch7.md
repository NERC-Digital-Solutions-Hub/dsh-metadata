# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

## Overview
- Final report (1993) detailing the production of a digital national land cover map for Great Britain using Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery.
- Part of Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990); funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and British National Space Centre (BNSC).
- Aimed to provide a readily accessible, map-based data product to support landscape planning, biodiversity studies, and environmental management.

## Data products and classification
- 25 target land cover classes defined, aggregated into 17 key classes for outputs and 9 major classes for pattern analyses.
- Hierarchical classification enables users to aggregate to coarser levels or use detailed subclasses when needed.
- Landsat TM data used to derive a digital land cover map, with a grid-cell structure at 25 m resolution (each cell is a 25 m square); minimum accurately mappable unit around 1 ha, with some patterns detectable down to 0.125 ha in areas with strong spectral signatures.
- Outputs include:
  - 25-class target data (digital raster at 25 m).
  - 17-key-class data (reduced to key outputs for general use).
  - 1 km summary data for integration with GIS and landscape analysis (based on 1 km grid cells, aggregating 25 m data).
  - Hard copy maps and figures illustrating examples across Britain.
- Data are designed for integration in GIS and for use in pattern analyses (e.g., boundary lengths, patch sizes).

## Methods and data processing
- Image acquisition and preparation:
  - Summer and winter Landsat TM scenes combined to improve class separation; co-registration to British National Grid (BNG).
  - Field reconnaissance across sample areas to establish training areas and subclasses.
  - 46 Landsat scenes required to cover Britain; where possible, summer-winter composites used; otherwise single-date data used.
- Classification approach:
  - Bayesian maximum likelihood classifier trained with field-derived training areas; iterative refinement with context and subclass adjustments.
  - Approximately 70–80 subclasses typically identified per scene, then aggregated to target classes.
  - Spectral bands used emphasize vegetation signals (red and near/middle infrared).
- Post-processing and masking:
  - Urban/suburban masking, coastal masks, cloud and snow masks, and shadow correction applied to improve accuracy.
  - Local interactive corrections for rare/edge cases; 3x3 kernel filtering used to reduce isolated misclassifications.
- Mosaic and data organization:
  -GB mosaic built from 100 km tiles; vector-to-raster handling considered; data stored as ~1 GB for the full map.
  - Output includes 2S data at 25 m resolution and 1 km summary data for CIS integration.

## Data outputs and formats
- Land Cover Map of Great Britain at 25 m resolution (2S data).
- 1 km resolution summary data (CIS-compatible), summarizing 25 m cells into percentages per cover type within each 1 km square.
- 17 key classes (for landscape analysis and pattern measures) and 9 major classes used for pattern analysis.
- Tables and appendices provide class definitions and crosswalks between 25-class target data and 17-class outputs.
- Outputs suitable for GIS analyses; CIS draws on Landsat-derived data plus field survey and other thematic layers (topography, soils, geology, climate, administrative boundaries).

## Validation, accuracy, and interpretation
- Validation against CS1990 field survey data and independent references:
  - Direct pixel-level agreement between Landsat-derived maps and field surveys varied (roughly 46% on a per-pixel basis due to definitional differences and boundary issues).
  - When accounting for definitional differences and time-based changes, overall correspondence improved to about 67%.
  - Excluding boundary pixels raised correspondence to about 71%.
  - Considering time-based changes (e.g., rotation farming, new plantings) increased overall correspondence to approximately 76%, with within-field agreement around 82%.
- Key sources of error:
  - Mixed boundary (edge) pixels and misregistrations.
  - Differences in field vs. Landsat class definitions (e.g., bogs vs. dwarf shrub; urban boundaries vs. full urban areas).
  - Time lags between field data collection and imagery acquisition.
  - Resolution-induced smoothing and generalisation of continuous landscapes into discrete classes.
- Moorland fringe mapping experiment and ESA mapping demonstrated the potential of Landsat data to capture specific vegetation communities and land-use patterns when integrated with field data and ancillary data.

## Integration with Countryside Survey 1990 and GIS
- CS1990 field survey provided detailed ground-based data (land cover, land use, linear features, species compositions) across 1 ha sampling units (1 Ian squares).
- Data integration:
  - Vector-field survey data converted to raster for pixel-level comparisons; 143 squares used for detailed testing.
  - Comparisons performed at multiple scales: 1 km grid, 25 m pixel level, and boundary-specific analyses.
  Comparisons highlighted that Landsat data complement field surveys, with field data offering fine-scale details that Landsat cannot always reproduce, and Landsat providing consistent national coverage for broad patterns.
- Countryside Information System (CIS):
  - 1 km summary data packaged for desktop GIS use, enabling administrators and researchers to query landscape patterns by region, altitude, geology, etc.
  - 17 key-class data layers plus boundary measures (e.g., edge length per square, pairwise boundary overlaps) implemented as multiple raster layers to facilitate regional and national analyses.
- Data handling considerations:
  - Handling 80,000 polygons for full Britain in vector form is challenging; raster format is preferred for national-scale analyses, while vector is more appropriate for specific local studies.

## GIS applications and demonstrator projects
- Demonstrated GIS capabilities by exporting Landsat-derived data into GIS environments and generating region-specific analyses (e.g., mean area per class, boundary lengths, and patch measures).
- Example applications:
  - Bird diversity analyses: linking Landsat-derived land cover with bird species richness using 2 km grid sampling.
  - Sparrowhawk habitat analyses in Cambridgeshire: woodland size variation and its relationship to predator distributions.
  - Tracking movements of radio-tagged birds by overlaying habitat maps with movement data to study habitat use and survival.
  - Landscape classification in road corridors (1 km buffers around major roads) to quantify woodland extent near infrastructure.
  - Gaseous emissions impact assessments around industrial sites by overlaying emissions plumes with vegetation sensitivity.
  - Water catchment studies: integrating land cover with hydrological and biodiversity data to assess catchment health.
- Overall, around 40 identified applications are underway or planned, spanning conservation, land-use planning, environmental chemistry, water resources, and GIS demonstration projects.

## Moorland fringe, environmentally sensitive areas, and additional outputs
- Moorland fringe mapping ( Lake District, Yorkshire Dales, North York Moors, Peak District) demonstrated high agreement (around 89%) between Landsat-based maps and field moorland maps, validating the approach for transitional zones.
- Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA) mapping in East Anglia showed Landsat-based mapping could align with photo-interpretation outputs, achieving substantial agreement with ground truth data when projected and simplified appropriately.
- The Landsat Land Cover Map was used as a knowledge base for future mapping updates and integration with other data layers in GIS.

## Challenges and limitations
- Cloud cover and data gaps remain a constraint; some areas (e.g., Tiree, parts of Shetland) lacked suitable winter data.
- Data volume and handling: national-scale Landsat data produce very large raster datasets; transformation to vector for all features is impractical at national extent.
- Boundary misregistrations and edge effects: a substantial portion of errors arise from pixels near class boundaries.
- Time-consistency issues: land cover changes over time complicate pixel-level comparisons between field data and imagery.
- The 25 m pixel size imposes a coarse quantisation of landscapes with many intermediate states; some subtle vegetation types may be indistinguishable spectrally.
- Computational demands of large-scale GIS analyses and the need for refined training areas and knowledge-based corrections.

## Future updates and developments
- Regular updating planned, with experience suggesting future cycles could be completed in two-thirds of the time of the original effort.
- Suggested improvements:
  - Exploit all-weather data (e.g., radar/SAR) to fill cloud gaps and provide winter data coverage.
  - Expand spectral signatures library and explore more automated classification approaches.
  - Improve summer–winter registration to reduce mixed-pixel confusions.
  - Use the current Land Cover Map as a knowledge base for ongoing updates, including training area definition and segmentation within new images.
  - Integrate Ordnance Survey boundary data to improve segmentation and boundary pixel allocation.
  - Increase detail for specific crops and finer grassland classifications where feasible.
  - Develop new sensor capabilities with higher spatial and spectral resolution, while addressing new data management challenges.
  - Explore automated, iterative updating workflows to make updating routine and more cost-effective.

## Concluding points
- The Land Cover Map of Great Britain represents a landmark achievement as the first national, digital land cover map since the 1960s and the first to be produced at a national scale in digital form.
- The dataset provides field-level pattern information (25 m cells) and a national 1 km summary suitable for GIS-based landscape analyses, enabling broad to detailed ecological and planning applications.
- While not perfect, the integration of Landsat-derived cover maps with detailed CS1990 field data and GIS-enabled analyses demonstrates substantial potential for informing biodiversity, land-use planning, environmental management, and policy development.
- The project established a robust methodology and a knowledge base for future remote sensing-based land-cover mapping across Britain, with clear pathways for updates, enhancements, and broader utilization.
