# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

- Purpose and scope
  - Produce a national, digital land cover map of Great Britain from Landsat Thematic Mapper data as part of Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990).
  - Create a reusable knowledge base to support landscape planning, environmental monitoring, and policy assessment.

- Data, classification, and methodology
  - Data and imagery
    - Landsat TM data used to map land cover; summer and winter scenes combined to improve discrimination.
    - Eight Landsat paths cover Britain; a total of 46 scenes required for full coverage.
    - Imagery processed and co-registered to British National Grid (BNG); mosaics built in 100 km tiles.
  - Classification and classes
    - Target: 25 land-cover classes; consolidated into 17 'key' classes for outputs; 9 'major' classes for pattern analysis.
    - Approach: supervised Bayesian (maximum likelihood) classification, using extensive field reconnaissance data for training.
    - Subclasses used to capture spectral variability, then aggregated to target classes; hierarchical structure allows both detailed and simplified outputs.
  - Field data and integration
    - Field reconnaissance across Britain per CS1990; Sample-based data captured land cover, land use, linear/point features, and species data.
    - Field data digitised in GIS for pixel-by-pixel comparisons with Landsat outputs.
    - Integration with CS1990 field data enables site-specific refinement of map outputs.
  - Pre- and post-processing and fixes
    - Masks to handle coastal (maritime), urban, cloud, snow/shadow, and other artifacts.
    - Local interactive corrections for rare classes; post-classification filtering (3x3 kernel) to reduce isolated misclassifications.
    - Mosaicking and co-registration to 20 m pixels; accuracy checks performed against independent references.
  - Output formats and data structure
    - Digital land-cover maps at 25 m resolution (2-pixel minimum mapping unit evidence) with about 1 GB data size for the full map.
    - 100 km square mosaic tiles; hard-copy outputs and GIS-ready formats.
    - Countryside Information System (CIS) integrates Landsat-derived data with CS1990 field data, providing 1 km summary patterns and edge/boundary metrics.

- Integration with Countryside Survey 1990 and GIS applications
  - CIS integration
    - Landsat-derived maps linked with CS1990 field data and 1978/1984 surveys; national GIS framework supports regional masks, soils, geology, climate, and boundaries.
    - Pattern analyses (at 1 km resolution) include: % cover per type, boundary pixels per square, and pairwise boundary overlaps (36 measures for 9 major classes).
  - Demonstrator GIS projects and applications
    - Demonstrated uses include linking land-cover patterns to bird diversity (Shannon index), sparrowhawk habitat studies, road proximity analyses, plume-dispersion and vegetation sensitivity, river catchment management, and key habitats conservation work.
    - About 40 specific applications identified or underway; data combinations with external datasets (soils, rivers, topography) to classify landscapes and habitats not readily observable by imagery alone.
  - Data accessibility and use by end-users
    - Outputs designed for easy access by planners, policymakers, and landscape managers; 1 km CIS summary data and 25-class and 17-key-class outputs support diverse analyses.

- Validation, accuracy, and limitations
  - Overall accuracy and correspondence
    - Direct field-to-Landsat pixel agreements range roughly 46% for certain detailed comparisons; when accounting for differing definitions and time-based changes, overall correspondence improves to about 67% (between field and Landsat at 1 km level) and up to 76% when time-change and boundary effects are considered.
    - Excluding boundary pixels raises correspondence to about 71%; within-field correspondence improves to ~82%.
    - Moorland fringe mapping showed high agreement in test areas (about 89% in four 10 km x 10 km areas).
  - Sources of error and interpretation
    - Major errors arise from mixed boundary pixels and misalignment between field and image data; time-lag between field surveys and imagery (seasonality, crop rotations) also affects comparability.
    - Differences in definitions across surveys (e.g., field botanist vs Landsat-based definitions) contribute to non-identical classifications; authors emphasize that many discrepancies reflect interpretation choices, not outright errors.
  - Coverage and data gaps
    - Approximately 12% of Britain lacked winter data; about 0.5% remained unmapped due to cloud or data gaps.
    - Some upland western areas had limited cloud-free winter data; suggestion to explore radar all-weather data in updates.
  - Overall conclusion on data quality
    - Landsat-based land-cover mapping provides a robust, digital, national-scale dataset with substantial utility for national-scale analyses and GIS-based pattern studies; known limitations relate to edge effects, mixed pixels, and time-based changes.

- Conclusions and significance for monitoring
  - First digital GB land-cover map since the 1960s; widely accessible for end-users and scalable for future monitoring.
  - Demonstrates the feasibility of national-scale, Landsat-based land-cover mapping, with a transparent, repeatable methodology suitable for updates and integration with other data sources.
  - The hierarchical classification system offers both detail and generalization, enabling use across diverse monitoring objectives and end-user needs.
  - Integration with CS1990 and CIS amplifies the value by combining field-verified information with satellite-derived patterns, supporting landscape monitoring, conservation planning, and policy evaluation.

- Future updates, improvements, and challenges
  - Update plan and automation
    - Regular updates planned; learning curve suggests future repeat surveys could require about two-thirds of the original effort, with opportunities for more automation.
  - Data gaps and all-weather mapping
    - Address cloud-related gaps; explore radar (SAR) and other data sources to provide all-weather coverage, particularly in upland western Britain.
  - Methodological enhancements
    - Expand spectral signature libraries; investigate more automated learning-based classification; improve summer–winter registration; refine boundary handling to reduce misclassifications.
  - Data richness and detail
    - Consider adding more detailed classes (e.g., specific crops or unimproved grasslands) where feasible; maintain compatibility with the 25-class target and 17-key-class outputs.
  - Sensor evolution and integration
    - Anticipate newer sensors with higher spatial/spectral resolution; combine legacy Landsat data with newer data streams for improved monitoring continuity and detail.
  - Practical uptake
    - Continue to expand end-user engagement; leverage CIS outputs for landscape management, environmental impact assessment, biodiversity monitoring, and policy performance evaluation.

- Key takeaways for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Provides a comprehensive, reproducible framework for national environmental monitoring using remote sensing complemented by ground truth.
  - Demonstrates how standardised, openly accessible data products (2S m Landsat-derived maps, 1 km CIS summaries) support scrutiny of environmental health and policy outcomes over time.
  - Highlights the value of integrating multiple data sources (field surveys, GIS, external datasets) to enrich interpretation and enable robust landscape analysis.
