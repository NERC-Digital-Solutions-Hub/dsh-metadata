COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

## Aim and scope
- Document final report of a national, digital land cover map for Great Britain created from Landsat Thematic Mapper data.
- Funded as a British National Space Centre (BNSC) demonstrator project with NERC support; integrated with the Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) led by the Department of the Environment.
- Objective: produce a national-scale, digital land-cover map to support landscape planning, environmental monitoring, and policy evaluation; enable site-specific estimates when combined with CS1990 field data; serve as a knowledge base for future remote-sensing mapping.

## What they did and how they did it
- Data and imagery
  - Used Landsat TM data (summer and winter scenes) to map land cover across Britain; eight Landsat paths provided near-complete coverage.
  - Created summer–winter composites to improve discrimination of vegetation types; where not possible, used single-date data.
  - Output focused on a 25 m pixel grid with a minimum accurately mappable unit around 1 ha (finer patterns down to 0.125 ha detectable for strongly spectral features).
- Classification and training
  - Employed Bayesian maximum likelihood classification guided by extensive field reconnaissance.
  - Trained with 100–200 pixels per subclass (typical) across 1200 land parcels per Landsat scene; produced 25 target classes.
  - Developed a hierarchical classification: 25 target classes, collapsed to 17 key classes for outputs, and further to 9 major classes for pattern analyses.
  - Implemented the LCD (Land Cover Definitions) framework to facilitate cross-survey comparability (17 key classes align with broad field surveys; 59 LCD field classes considered in related work).
- Field data and integration
  - CS1990 field surveys: stratified random sample of 1, Ian-scale squares (508 squares total) with detailed ground data (land cover, land use, linear/point features, plant species, aquatic invertebrates).
  - Field data digitised into GIS; used to validate and integrate with the Landsat-derived maps.
  - Vector-to-raster comparisons, plus 1 km grid comparisons, to assess correspondence between Landsat maps and field data.
- Post-processing and corrections
  - Masking and correction procedures to handle urban, coastal, seabed, saltmarsh, cloud, snow, and shadow effects.
  - Local interactive corrections for rare/edge cases; 3×3 kernel filtering to remove isolated misclassifications.
  - Mosaic assembly of full GB land cover from 100 km tiles; extensive quality control around scene boundaries.
- GIS and outputs
  - Built a GIS-based Countryside Information System (CIS) integration framework; 1 km summaries used for national pattern analyses; 25 m Landsat layers kept for detailed analyses.
  - Outputs include digital raster maps, supporting figures (e.g., London, Norfolk Broads, North York Moors, Ardnamurchan), and hard-copy map productions.
- Validation and accuracy
  - Direct agreement between Landsat and field maps varied (approx. 46% for exact pixel-to-pixel matches; higher when considering boundary pixels and time-differences).
  - Overall correspondence improved to:
    - 67% when accounting for different definitions; 71% when excluding mixed boundary pixels; around 76% when including time-based changes (and 82% within-field pixels).
  - Moorland fringe mapping showed 89% agreement between Landsat and field maps in four test areas.
  - Comparisons with other data (e.g., Environmentally Sensitive Areas) yielded 78–88% agreement depending on the comparison scope.
- Data governance and openness
  - Emphasised that the land cover data are digital and accessible; integration with CIS enables end-users to access, query, and analyse the data; data sharing is part of the governance approach, though some classes and boundary areas present challenges for some users.

## Data outputs and integration
- Class structure and outputs
  - 25 target land-cover classes, aggregated into 17 key classes (and further into 9 major classes for pattern analysis).
  - Outputs provided as 25-layer 25 m resolution rasters (key classes) and 17-layer 1 km summary rasters; unclassified areas labeled separately.
- Integration with other data
  - Linked with CS1990 field data (land cover, land use, ecological data) to enable refined, site-specific estimates.
  - CIS provides a 1 km pattern-analysis framework:
    - Percentage cover by class per 1 km square
    - Boundary pixel percentages per class per square
    - Pairwise boundary overlaps per square
  - Facilitates overlay with soils, geology, climate, administrative boundaries, and other thematic layers for landscape-scale analyses.
- Applications and demonstrations
  - Demonstrated applications across biodiversity, biogeography, environmental chemistry, landscape planning, conservation, and environmental impact assessment.
  - GIS demonstrations included analyses relating land-cover diversity to bird species richness, habitat mapping for raptors, and corridor/buffer analyses around roads or industrial sites.
  - About 40 current or planned applications; data usage across government departments, agencies, consultants, and research organizations.

## Key findings and outputs
- The Land Cover Map of Great Britain is the first modern digital national land-cover map for Britain since the 1960s, enabling end-user access and analysis.
- The mapping approach successfully covers a wide range of landscapes (urban, arable, grasslands, moorlands, heathlands, wetlands, woodlands).
- The hierarchical 25-to-17-to-9 class structure provides a balance between detail and consistency across Britain; the 17-key classes align with many field survey results for cross-study comparability.
- Validation shows substantial alignment with field data, especially when acknowledging differences in definitions, time-lags, and boundary complexities; the map is a robust baseline for national and regional monitoring.
- The CIS integration demonstrates how satellite-derived land-cover data can complement traditional field surveys, enabling scalable pattern analysis and landscape-level decision support.

## Challenges and limitations (relevant to monitoring frameworks)
- Data gaps and coverage
  - About 12% of Britain lacked winter data; roughly 0.5% remained unmapped due to cloud or limited scenes; some upland western areas had sparse winter data.
- Boundary and mixed pixels
  - Large proportion of pixels lie on boundaries; misclassification and time-lag issues can affect pixel-level accuracy though overall area estimates remain robust.
- Temporal dynamics
  - Differences between field survey timing (1990) and Landsat imaging (1988–1990 window) can introduce discrepancies due to land-use changes (e.g., rotations in arable land, forest planting).
- Scale and detail
  - 25 m pixel resolution may miss very fine features; 1 km summaries can mask local heterogeneity; high complexity of grassland and moorland classes requires contextual masks for regional separation.
- Data management and computational demands
  - Handling large raster/vector datasets (e.g., 80,000 polygons in Britain) requires substantial GIS processing power and careful data management; cross-cutting analyses across 700×1300 cell layers generate substantial storage needs.
- Metadata and data governance
  - Need for robust metadata, transparent data-sharing policies, and governance to ensure datasets meet standard definitions, can be replicated, and are openly accessible for monitoring purposes.

## Future updates and recommendations
- Regular updates and automation
  - Plan to update the Land Cover Map regularly; repeat surveys could be completed in two-thirds of the original time with improved automation.
- Data enhancements
  - Expand spectral libraries and knowledge-based corrections; explore radar and all-weather data to address cloud gaps; aim for more automated classification with spectral signatures.
- Data integration and governance
  - Continue integrating Landsat-based maps with field data in CIS; refine boundary and region-level analyses; enhance boundary detection and segmentation for improved per-pixel accuracy.
- Sensor and technology evolution
  - Anticipate next-generation sensors with higher spatial and spectral resolution; plan to merge multiple data sources to improve update speed and accuracy.
- Operationalization
  - Develop procedures to update from known training areas, masks, and classification rules; maintain a knowledge base to support future mapping without starting from scratch.

## Conclusions (condensed relevant points for monitoring frameworks)
- This project demonstrates how a national monitoring framework can combine remote-sensing data (satellite imagery) with ground-truth field surveys to produce a digital, policy-relevant land-cover dataset.
- The process established a scalable workflow: data acquisition, hierarchical classification, context-based corrections, rigorous validation, and GIS-enabled integration with management and planning tools.
- The Land Cover Map serves as a baseline for monitoring landscape change, supporting environmental policy, natural-resource management, biodiversity studies, and sustainability planning.
- Ongoing governance, metadata, data-sharing practices, and planned updates are essential to maintain the data’s usefulness for monitoring frameworks over time.
