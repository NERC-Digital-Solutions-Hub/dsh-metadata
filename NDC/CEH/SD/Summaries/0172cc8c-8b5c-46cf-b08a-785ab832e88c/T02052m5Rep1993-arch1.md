# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

- Purpose and scope
  - Final report on digital land cover mapping of Great Britain using Landsat imagery, produced as a demonstrator project funded by NERC and BNSC.
  - Integrated with Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) to support landscape planning, management, and environmental research.
  - Presents methods, results, applications, and future directions for remote-sensing–based land cover mapping.

- Data sources and imagery
  - Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data at 30 m resolution, covering Britain across eight paths.
  - Preferred use of summer and winter images to improve discrimination of vegetation types and to separate semi-natural vegetation from arable land.
  - Where available, extended periods (±2 years) were used to ensure full coverage; cloud, haze, and shadow masks used to clean data.
  - Field data from CS1990 collected in 1990 (stratified random sample of 1,000 1-km squares) for ground-truthing and integration.

- Methodology and workflow
  - Image preparation: geometric correction and co-registration to British National Grid; creation of summer-winter composite images; six-band data used for classification.
  - Classification approach: supervised Bayesian maximum-likelihood classifier; training Areas created from field reconnaissance routes; typical training involved 100–200 pixels per subclass, with some minimums around 30 pixels.
  - Target vs. key classifications: 25 target land-cover classes defined, aggregated into 17 key classes, and further reduced to 9 major classes for pattern analysis.
  - Contextual and post-classification corrections: masks for urban/suburban, coastal, cloud, and snow; local interactive corrections for rare classes; post-classification 3×3 kernel filtering to remove isolated pixels; mosaic building from 100 km tiles (GB-wide).
  - Data outputs and integration: raster land-cover maps at 25 m cells with 0.125 ha minimum mappable unit; integrated with CS1990 field data and organized within the Countryside Information System (CIS) at 1 km resolution.

- Land cover classification and outputs
  - 25 target classes mapped, aggregated to 17 key classes (A–Q) for outputs; 9 major classes used for pattern analysis.
  - Outputs include: full GB land-cover maps (2S m grid, approx. 1 GB data file), a 1 km summary dataset (CIS), and hard-copy map outputs with regional examples (e.g., London, Norfolk Broads, North York Moors, Ardnamurchan).
  - Map accuracy and scale: patterns detectable at field-by-field scale (1 ha accuracy minimum, with some 0.125 ha units captured for features with strong spectral signatures).

- Validation and accuracy
  - Direct correspondence with ground reference data typically between 67% and 90%, depending on class detail and landscape complexity.
  - Including boundary pixels and time-related changes lowers/adjusts accuracy; overall correspondence around 76% when time-based differences are allowed; 82% for within-field pixels.
  - After accounting for differing definitions between Landsat and field surveys, overall agreement improves to around 67% (significant when definitions are harmonised); boundary-excluded correspondence rises to about 71%.
  - Key issues: mixed boundary (edge) pixels, time-lag differences between field surveys and imagery, and differences in how landscapes are generalized into discrete classes.
  - Moorland fringe mapping and ESA mapping showed high agreement in targeted areas, though differences arise from methodological distinctions (field botanist vs remote-sensing classification).

- Integration with Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) and GIS outputs
  - CS1990 provided 508 stratified squares for detailed field surveys; data digitized in GIS and linked with Landsat-derived maps for comparison.
  - validation performed at multiple levels: vector field squares, 2S Landsat data vs LCD 17-class outputs, and 1 km grid comparisons; differences largely due to definitional and temporal factors.
  - Results demonstrate complementary strengths: Landsat maps provide broad coverage and consistent land-cover classification, while CS1990 offers detailed site-specific ecological information.
  - Countryside Information System (CIS) consolidates Landsat land-cover data with field data, 1 km summaries, and additional thematic layers (topography, soils, geology, climate) for landscape analyses.
  - CIS measures include 1 km grid statistics per cover type, edge/pixel boundary metrics, and 36 pairwise boundary combinations across 9 major classes, supporting landscape pattern analyses and regional assessments.

- GIS applications and demonstrator projects
  - Demonstrated GIS capability by linking Landsat-derived land cover with relational attribute data and spatial features (e.g., rivers, roads, boundaries) to analyze habitat and landscape patterns.
  - Examples of applications:
    - Bird diversity studies: land-cover pattern metrics correlated with species diversity (e.g., Shannon index) at tetrad or 2×2 km grid scales.
    - Sparrowhawk habitat analysis in Cambridgeshire using woodland sizes and land-cover variability.
    - Tracking movements of radio-tagged birds mapped onto land-cover for habitat-use analyses.
    - Regional corridor analyses around roads to quantify woodland within buffers and assess habitat impact.
    - Emission-plume impact studies overlaying vegetation sensitivity with modeled plumes.
    - River catchment management, water quality, and wildlife distribution analyses integrating land-cover with other thematic data.
  - Broad portfolio of current and planned uses, with around 40 specific applications identified, spanning conservation, landscape planning, hydrology, and environmental chemistry.

- Applications and potential uses
  - Land-use planning, biodiversity conservation, landscape pattern analysis, and environmental impact assessment.
  - Integration with soils, geology, climate, and administrative data to support regional planning and monitoring.
  - Development of knowledge-based corrections and future automated classification frameworks to improve speed and accuracy in updating land-cover maps.

- Limitations and challenges
  - Uneven cloud-free data availability and seasonal variability leading to unmapped areas (approx. 12% lacking winter data; residual 0.5% unmapped due to cloud).
  - Geometric misregistrations between summer and winter images; mixed boundary pixels remain a primary source of per-pixel error.
  - Differences in definitions and scale between field surveys and Landsat classifications; time lags between imagery and ground truth can distort changes.
  - Handling large-scale vector data and detailed 25 m parcel information posed computational and data-management challenges, motivating rasterized approaches and GIS optimizations.

- Conclusions
  - This project produced the first digital land-cover map of Great Britain since the 1960s, enabling national-scale, data-driven landscape analyses.
  - The Landsat TM–based land-cover map integrates with CS1990 field data and GIS frameworks (CIS) to support broad applications in ecology, conservation, planning, and environmental management.
  - The classification scheme balances detail and practicality, offering a hierarchical set of target classes and a 17-class summary suitable for most analyses, with subclass detail available for specialist use.
  - The approach demonstrates the value of combining remote-sensing data with ground-truth surveys to understand and monitor Britain’s landscapes, and it establishes a foundation for routine future updates.

- Future updates and recommendations
  - Complete nationwide coverage with improved winter data; explore all-weather datasets (e.g., radar) to fill gaps.
  - Expand spectral signature library and automate classification using existing knowledge bases to enhance consistency and repeatability.
  - Improve summer–winter registration and edge-detection techniques to reduce per-pixel errors; investigate within-segment classification and boundary corrections.
  - Incorporate additional data layers (OS boundary data, soils, geology) to refine region-specific classifications and pattern analyses.
  - Consider higher-spatial-resolution sensors and multi-spectral improvements to capture greater detail (e.g., specific crop types) while managing data volume.
  - Develop automated update workflows to enable more frequent re-mapping and integration with CIS for ongoing decision-support.
