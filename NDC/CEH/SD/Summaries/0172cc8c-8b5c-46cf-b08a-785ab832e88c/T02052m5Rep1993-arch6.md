# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

- Overview
  - First digital map of land cover for Great Britain since the 1960s; launched July 1993 by NERC and BNSC.
  - Part of the Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990); integrates remotely sensed land cover with field data.
  - Uses Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery to create a national digital land cover map.
  - Classifications are organized hierarchically: 25 target land cover types, aggregated to 17 key classes for broad outputs, and further to 9 major classes for pattern analysis.
  - Produces 25 m grid cells (two-pixel minimum mappable unit effectively around 0.125 ha; detailed patterns down to ~0.125–0.25 ha in some cases).
  - Data outputs include a PC-based Countryside Information System (CIS) at 1 km resolution for landscape planning and management.

- Methods and Data Processing
  - Landsat TM imagery used with summer and winter data to improve discrimination of vegetation types.
  - 46 scenes required to cover Britain; images co-registered to British National Grid; six-band composite (bands 3, 4, 5 from summer and winter).
  - Supervised Bayesian maximum likelihood classification with extensive field reconnaissance to define training areas; typically 70–80 subclasses identified per scene then aggregated to target classes.
  - Post-classification corrections and contextual, knowledge-based adjustments to improve mapping accuracy.
  - Masking and correction procedures:
    - Urban/suburban masking to separate built-up areas from arable land.
    - Coastal (intertidal/estuarine) masking to separate maritime from terrestrial areas.
    - Cloud, cloud-shadow, and snow masks; interactive and automated approaches to patch misclassifications.
  - Post-classification filtering (3x3 kernel) to remove isolated misclassified pixels; mosaicking to create seamless GB-wide maps.
  - Output formats:
    - Digital land cover maps at ~25 m resolution (c. 1 GB data; ~100 km grid tiles).
    - Hard-copy outputs and filmwriter negatives for examples (e.g., London, Norfolk Broads, North York Moors, Ardnamurchan).

- Land Cover Classification and Outputs
  - 25 target classes defined; 17 key classes for general data outputs, aligned with CS1990 field data; 9 major classes used for pattern analyses in CIS.
  - Class descriptions provided (Appendix 1) to ensure consistent interpretation across end users.
  - A new knowledge-based, context-sensitive correction approach was developed and integrated into the mapping workflow.
  - Output in two main ways:
    - 25-class target data (two-dimensional raster with a value representing the proportion of a cell covered by each target class).
    - 17-class summary data (1 km grid) and 9 class pairwise boundaries for pattern analyses.

- Integration with Countryside 1990 Field Survey
  - CS1990 field surveys employed stratified random sampling (508 1 km squares) to record land cover, land use, and landscape features; data digitized into GIS/Oracle database for integration.
  - Comparisons performed at three levels:
    1) Vector field-square boundaries converted to raster for pixel-by-pixel comparison (143 squares for 25-class correspondences).
    2) 25 Landsat classes vs LCD 59 baseline field classes aggregated to 17 key types across 2,5, and 1 km scales.
    3) Full comparison at 1 km scale for all squares against LCD field classes.
  - Validation results indicate substantial alignment but reflect definitional differences between field and remote-sensing classifications.

- Validation and Accuracy
  - Direct agreement (vector-to-raster) around 46% (subject to class definitions and boundary issues).
  - Overall correspondence improves to about 67% when harmonizing definitions; ~76% when time-based changes are considered (e.g., land-use rotations).
  - Within-field agreement rises to about 82% when considering only in-situ land-cover pixels (excluding boundaries).
  - Moorland and coastal/maritime mapping show higher concordance in targeted studies; moorland fringe mapping achieved about 89% agreement across four test areas (Lake District, Yorkshire Dales, North York Moors, Peak District).
  - Differences largely arise from:
    - Boundaries and mixed pixels at class edges.
    - Time-lag changes between field surveys and imagery.
    - Differences in classification rules and objectives between field surveys and Landsat-based mapping.
  - The LCD project will provide fuller results and intercomparison analyses.

- GIS Applications and Demonstrator Projects
  - GIS-enabled analyses demonstrated across a Thames estuary test area (75 x 50 km); conversion from raster to vector to analyze land parcels.
  - Applied studies include:
    - Bird species diversity correlations with land cover pattern (BTO work).
    - Sparrowhawk habitat studies in Cambridgeshire.
    - Tracking movements of radio-tagged birds against land cover types.
    - Regional road corridor habitat assessments near motorways.
    - Emission plume impacts on vegetation.
    - Water catchment and river basin analyses (NEWP project, Tyne and Cam rivers).
    - Key Habitats project combining Landsat data with terrain, soils, and hydrological data for landscape-scale conservation planning.
  - Approximately 40 specific applications identified or underway, with a broader catalog of potential uses.

- Existing and Planned Uses
  - Examples of current/planned uses include key habitats mapping, conservation surveys, assessment of less favored areas, Moorland landscape management, heathland restoration potential, species-landscape studies, land-use and biogeography analyses, water quality correlations, GIS-based research and development, environmental impact assessments, and education geographies.

- Future Updates and Improvements
  - Ongoing updates planned to maintain a current land cover map; repeat mapping could be completed in roughly two-thirds of the original effort.
  - Areas for improvement:
    - Better handling of cloud-covered areas with all-weather data (e.g., SAR/radar) to supplement gaps.
    - Expanded spectral signature libraries to support more automated classifications.
    - Improved summer–winter registration to reduce misregistration and mixed pixels.
    - Routine use of the land cover map as a knowledge base for training areas, mask creation, and segmentation in new classifications.
    - Enhanced detail in land cover types (e.g., specific crops) and higher-spatial-resolution sensors in future data.
    - Potential integration of OS boundary data to improve segmentation and boundary accuracy.
    - Consideration of combining old and new methods for faster, routine updates.
  - Emphasis on the data being a reusable knowledge base enabling efficient updates and cross-dataset integration.

- Conclusions
  - The joint funding by BNSC and NERC produced Britain’s first digital land cover map since the 1960s and one of the few such national-scale products of its time.
  - The map provides high-detail, field-referenced land cover across Britain, accessible in digital form for broad end-user use.
  - Methodology successfully demonstrates mapping across diverse landscapes (urban, arable, moorland, woodland, coastal) and supports a wide range of applications in conservation, planning, and environmental management.
  - Limitations include incomplete cloud-free coverage (about 12% of Britain unmapped in winter data; some 0.5% unmapped overall), time-based land-use changes, and boundary-related misclassifications; nonetheless, the overall performance is robust for many national-scale analyses.
  - The project established a scalable framework for updating and extending land cover mapping using Landsat TM data and GIS-based analyses, forming a foundation for future sensor improvements and methodological enhancements.
