# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

## Overview
- Final report published August 1993; joint funding by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the British National Space Centre (BNSC).
- Purpose: produce the first digital, national land cover map of Great Britain from Landsat imagery as part of Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990); integrate with CS1990 field data for landscape planning and management.
- Dataset structure:
  - 25 target land cover classes, aggregated to 17 key classes (for broad reporting) and 9 major classes used in pattern analyses.
  - Maps are grid-cell based at 25 m resolution; an integrated 1 km resolution system (CIS) provides summary pattern data.
  - Output includes both raster data and hard-copy/map outputs; data volume around 1 GB for the full Landsat-based map.
- Process and outputs:
  - Digital map produced by supervised maximum likelihood classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, using summer and winter composites.
  - Integrated with CS1990 field survey data and the Countryside Information System (CIS) for landscape planning and management.
  - Initial release followed by demonstrations of GIS applications and numerous potential uses across agencies and universities.

## Data Governance and Standards
- Classification framework:
  - 25 target classes defined from prior surveys; aggregated into 17 key classes and further to 9 pattern classes for CIS analyses.
  - Hierarchical structure enables both detailed and simplified classifications.
- Data lineage and documentation:
  - Based on Landsat TM imagery (summer+winter composites) with training data from field reconnaissance; Appendix 1 provides class descriptions and Appendix 2 lists organizations involved at launch.
- Quality assurance mechanisms:
  - Contextual and knowledge-based corrections (not just per-pixel classification) to improve accuracy.
  - Masks and post-classification procedures (urban, coastal, cloud, snow) to reduce misclassifications.
  - Post-classification filtering (3x3 kernel) to avoid over-smoothing while removing isolated misclassified pixels.
- Data update and governance:
  - Aimed at regular updates to maintain relevance; plans to refine methods, automate processes, and potentially incorporate new data sources (e.g., radar) for all-weather mapping.
  - Clear documentation of methods, accuracy expectations, and limitations to support governance and reuse.

## Data Acquisition and Processing
- Data sources:
  - Landsat TM imagery across eight paths; used summer and winter scenes to improve spectral separation of land cover types.
  - Field reconnaissance conducted to define training areas; imagery co-registered to British National Grid (BNG).
- Processing workflow:
  - geometric correction and co-registration to ~0.8 pixel (20 m) accuracy; mosaic construction with 100 km tiles.
  - Maximum likelihood classification applied to ~46 scenes; iterative refinement with training areas and contextual corrections.
  - Handling of data gaps due to cloud: 46 scenes required; some dates extended ±2 years to accommodate cloud-free coverage.
- Data management:
  - Large data volumes managed with substantial disk storage (1.4 GB during processing); output formats include raster 25 m data and 1 km summary data for CIS.

## Classification Scheme and Data Model
- 25 target land cover classes (2S dataset) mapped to 17 key classes (for reporting) and 9 major classes (pattern analysis).
- Table 1 mapping: correspondence between 25 target classes and 17 key classes; 25 m target classes are represented as bands in the 1 km summary data.
- Output layers:
  - 25-layer Landsat-based target data or a consolidated 17-layer key-class dataset at 1 km resolution.
  - 1 km CIS data with 700 x 1300 integer percentage values per cover type (cover-type proportions in each 1 km square).
  - Edge/boundary data and pairwise boundary data for landscape pattern analyses (36 layers for 9 major class pairings).
- Data granularity and limits:
  - Minimum mappable unit approximately 0.125 ha (two Landsat pixels), with recognition that accuracy is better at larger extents.
  - Some areas remain unclassified (0 in 25-class data) due to cloud or unusual cover types.

## Validation, Accuracy, and Uncertainty
- Validation approaches:
  - Vector (field) vs raster (Landsat) comparisons for 143 squares; additional 256-squares comparisons and 1 km grid-point summaries.
- Reported accuracies:
  - Direct agreements between field and Landsat classifications range from about 46% to 61% depending on class grouping and boundary treatment.
  - Overall correspondence around 67% after harmonizing class definitions; 71% when boundary pixels are excluded; 76% when time-based changes are considered (within-field accuracy ~82%).
  - Moorland fringe mapping showed ~89% agreement across four test areas.
- Key sources of error:
  - Mixed boundary pixels and misregistrations between dates, definitions, and boundaries.
  - Time lags between field surveys and imagery (for some land uses that rotate seasonally).
  - Differences in definitions between field surveys and Landsat-based mapping (e.g., bog definitions vs. dwarf shrub categories).
- Interpretation and limitations:
  - No single “ground truth”; accuracy depends on definitions, spatial scale, and objective of the analysis.
  - The Landsat-based map is a general-purpose product intended to support diverse applications, not a perfect one-to-one correspondence with field surveys.

## Integration with Countryside Information System (CIS)
- CIS purpose and scope:
  - PC-based desktop system combining CS1990 field data, Landsat-derived land cover, and additional thematic data for landscape analyses.
- 1 km pattern analyses:
  - Pattern metrics: percent cover by type per square, percent boundary pixels, and overlaps for selected pairwise boundaries.
  - Data structure: 17 key classes output as 700 x 1300 grids per class (total ~64 MB for the 17 layers; additional layers for 36 pairwise boundaries).
- GIS integration and applications:
  - Facilitates analyses that combine land cover with soils, geology, climate, and administrative boundaries.
  - Supported planning and decision-making for landscape management, conservation, and environmental assessments.
- Practical demonstrations:
  - Bird diversity relationships (BTO studies), sparrowhawk habitat analyses, and corridor/road proximity analyses.
  - Demonstrator projects include watershed management, emissions impact analyses, and landscape classification for conservation planning.

## GIS Applications and Demonstrator Projects
- Demonstrator scope:
  - Thames estuary area (75 km x 50 km) showcases raster-to-vector transitions and large-scale GIS analyses.
  - Demonstrations linked to biodiversity, landscape management, and environmental risk assessments.
- Wider impact and uptake:
  - Approximately 40 identified applications under consideration or underway; early engagement with government agencies and researchers.
  - Data and outputs inform conservation designations, land-use planning, and environmental impact assessments.

## Future Updates and Roadmap
- Ongoing update plans:
  - Regular updating of the Land Cover Map; recognition that some areas (roughly 12%) remain unmapped due to cloud cover or lack of suitable winter data.
  - Plans to leverage all-weather data (e.g., radar/SAR) to fill gaps and improve year-round coverage.
- Methodological improvements:
  - Development of a spectral library for major habitats to support more automated classifications.
  - Enhanced image registration between summer and winter composites to reduce misalignment and edge artifacts.
  - Exploration of integrating new sensor data with improved spatial and spectral resolution.
- Knowledge base and automation:
  - Treat the Land Cover Map as a knowledge base to assist future mapping; masks, training areas, and segmentation rules can facilitate updates.
  - Consider automated or semi-automated classifications guided by the existing map, with uncertainty quantification to distinguish real changes from error.
- Data richness:
  - Potential to add more detailed classes (e.g., crop types) where feasible and to refine patterns with higher-resolution sensors.

## Data Access, Usage, and Acknowledgments
- Data accessibility:
  - Digital data products designed for broad accessibility; supports GIS and pattern analyses at national and regional scales.
- Acknowledgments:
  - Recognition of funding from BNSC and NERC, collaboration with CS1990 end-users, and involvement of numerous organizations and stakeholders listed in Appendix 2.

## Limitations and Caveats for Data Stewards
- Cloud cover and data gaps:
  - Approximately 12% of Britain not covered by winter data; some areas unmapped due to cloud or limited single-date data.
- Classification and generalization:
  - Differences in how land cover and land use are defined across surveys lead to interpretative differences; per-pixel accuracy cannot be equated with field mapping truth.
  - The 25-class to 17-class reduction and the aggregation to 9 pattern classes introduce intentional generalization.
- Spatial and temporal dynamics:
  - Time-based land-cover changes (e.g., rotations between arable and pasture) can affect correspondence between Landsat data and field surveys.
- Data scale considerations:
  - Handling ~80,000 polygons for Britain at full resolution poses practical challenges for some GIS workloads; raster representations mitigate this but can obscure fine-scale detail.

## Conclusions
- The Land Cover Map of Great Britain represents the first digital, national-scale land cover dataset of its kind since the 1960s and one of the first to be produced in digital form.
- It provides a nationwide, GIS-ready dataset that supports landscape planning, conservation, and environmental research, and it integrates with the CS1990 field survey data via the CIS.
- The project demonstrates practical methodologies for large-area land cover mapping from remotely sensed data, including knowledge-based corrections, robust masking, and iterative validation.
- The dataset has generated substantial interest and a broad set of potential applications; a formal update and methodological enhancements are planned to improve coverage, accuracy, and automation, leveraging evolving remote sensing technologies.
