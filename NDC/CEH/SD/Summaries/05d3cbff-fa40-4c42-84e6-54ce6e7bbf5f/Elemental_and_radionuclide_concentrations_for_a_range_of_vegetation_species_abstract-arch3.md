# Elemental and radionuclide concentrations for several vegetation species from a site in Extremadura, Spain

## Overview
- Study of elemental and radionuclide concentrations in freeze-dried Mediterranean plants, seeds, and oven-dried soil.
- Collected June 2014 along a transect in Monfragüe National Park, Cáceres, western Spain.
- Includes 30 plant species, seeds from 6 species, and 3 soil samples; analyzed for multiple elements and gamma-emitting radionuclides.

## Sampling design and materials
- Plant material: 30 species collected along transect (full species list provided in the study).
- Seeds: collected from 6 species (marked in the list).
- Soil: 3 samples collected from along the transect.
- Location details: transect start and end specified with GPS coordinates.
- Samples processed: stored cool, transported to the UK, freeze-dried, weighed, and ground (vegetation) or prepared as soil.
- Purpose: determine elemental concentrations and radionuclide activity in vegetation, seeds, and soil.

## Analytical methods

### Elemental concentrations
- Digestion: aqua regia (3:1 HNO3:HCl) at 175°C for 12 minutes using a microwave system.
- Instrumental analysis: ICPMS (ICPMS, Perkin Elmer NexION 300D) and ICPOES (Perkin Elmer Optima 7300 DV).
- Modes: semi-quantitative and quantitative analyses.
  - Semi-quantitative: uses concentration-to-intensity response curves over a wide mass range.
  - Quantitative: external calibration with internal standards added to digests (Ga, In, Re at 10 µg L⁻¹) to correct for drift and matrix effects.
- LODs: calculated from blanks; for some elements where blanks were insufficient, an instrument LOD of 0.001 µg L⁻¹ was assigned (equivalent to a mean method LOD of 0.001 mg kg⁻¹ after digestion).
- Reported units: mg kg⁻¹ dry mass.
- Data handling: results include method LODs; values below LOD may be reported as <LOD.

### Radionuclide concentrations
- Radionuclides measured: Be-7, Cs-137, K-40.
- Technique: gamma-spectrometry using hyper-pure germanium detectors for four days per sample.
- Calibration: efficiency calibrated with a mixed radionuclide standard across energies ~59–1850 keV; density-based calibration for sample types; Canberra Apex software used for spectrum analysis.
- QA: detector densities, standard concentrations, and proficiency testing are part of the workflow.
- Minimum detectable activity (MDA): depends on detector, counting time, sample type, and mass/volume.
- Reported units: becquerel per kilogram dry mass (Bq kg⁻¹).
- Data handling: results below MDA reported as <MDA.

## Data quality, reporting and governance
- Data quality emphasis: use of internal standards, calibration, blanks, and proficiency testing to ensure reliability.
- Metadata and transparency: detailed reporting of sample processing, digestion, instrument settings, and LOD/MDA considerations to support data interpretation and comparability.
- Output format: elemental concentrations (mg kg⁻¹ dry mass) and radionuclide activities (Bq kg⁻¹ dry mass); non-detects clearly indicated with < values.
- Data sharing and standards: data quality practices align with broader environmental monitoring standards; methodologies described to enable replication and assessment.
