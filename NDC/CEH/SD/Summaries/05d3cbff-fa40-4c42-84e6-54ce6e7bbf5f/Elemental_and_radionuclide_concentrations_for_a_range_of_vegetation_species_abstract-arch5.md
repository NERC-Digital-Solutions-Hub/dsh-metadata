# Elemental and radionuclide concentrations for several vegetation species from a site in Extremadura, Spain

## Scope and sampling overview
- Study of elemental and radionuclide concentrations in freeze-dried Mediterranean plants, seeds, and oven-dried soil.
- Samples collected in June 2014 along a transect in Monfragüe National Park, Cáceres, western Spain (GPS coordinates provided for transect start and end).
- Plant set includes 30 species; seeds collected from six of these species; three soil samples.
- Plants stored cool, then transported to the UK where they were freeze-dried and ground for analysis.
- Data are reported as concentrations per dry mass and activity per dry mass, with detailed metadata on sampling locations and species.

## Analytical methods and workflow
- Sample preparation:
  - Freeze-drying, weighing, and fine grinding of plant material.
  - Subsamples taken for gamma analysis from larger plant samples and soil.
  - Digestion of ground material via aqua regia (3:1 HNO3:HCl) at 175°C for 12 minutes in a microwave.
- Elemental analysis:
  - Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS, Perkin Elmer NexION 300D) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICPOES, Perkin Elmer Optima 7300 DV).
  - Two operation modes: semi-quantitative (kinetic energy discrimination with He) and quantitative (external calibration with internal standards Ga, In, Re).
  - Semi-quantitative mode uses a concentration-to-intensity curve across a wide mass range; quantitative mode uses calibration curves with internal standards.
- Data quality and detection:
  - Limits of detection (LODs) derived from blanks; some semi-quantitative LODs estimated where blanks were unsuitable, assigned 0.001 µg L⁻¹.
  - Total method LODs calculated accounting for sample mass and digestion dilution.
- Radionuclide analysis:
  - Gamma-emitting radionuclides Be-7, K-40, and Cs-137 measured on hyper-pure germanium detectors over four days.
  - Efficiency calibration based on sample density; spectra analysed with Canberra Apex software.
  - Calibration performed using mixed radionuclide standards; density/volume calibration; laboratories participate in proficiency testing.
  - Minimum detectable activity (MDA) varies by sample, detector, count time, and sample characteristics.
- Quality and provenance:
  - Internal standards (Ga, In, Re) for drift and matrix corrections; proficiency testing for gamma detectors.
  - Documentation includes instrument settings, calibration details, and QA considerations to support reproducibility.

## Data outputs and units
- Elemental concentrations reported as milligrams per kilogram dry mass (mg/kg dry mass).
- Radionuclide activity concentrations reported as becquerels per kilogram dry mass (Bq/kg dry mass).
- Values below detection are indicated with a “<” prefix for LODs/MDA.

## Data quality, governance, and provenance
- Detailed documentation of sampling locations (GPS WG84 coordinates) and transect geometry.
- Comprehensive methodological metadata enabling replication (sample prep, digestion, instrument modes, internal standards, calibration approach, and LODs/MDA).
- Explicit notes on when LODs were estimated and the assumptions used.
- Acknowledged funding and institutional support, with associations to COMET, TREE, NERC, Environment Agency, Radioactive Waste Management Ltd., and Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
