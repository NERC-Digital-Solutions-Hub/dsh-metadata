# Elemental and radionuclide concentrations for several vegetation species from a site in Extremadura, Spain

## Overview
- Study of elemental and radionuclide concentrations in freeze-dried Mediterranean plants, seeds, and oven-dried soil.
- Samples collected in June 2014 along a transect in Monfragüe National Park, Cáceres, western Spain.
- Data include 30 plant species, seeds from 6 of those species, and 3 soil samples; gamma-emitting radionuclides analyzed in selected plant seeds and soils.

## Sampling design and materials
- Transect coordinates referenced to WG 84: start and end positions provided with precise GPS coordinates.
- Plant species collected: 30 identified species (examples include Agrostis pourretii, Taraxacum sp., Viburnum tinus, Pistacia terebinthus, Cistus ladanifer, Ficus carica, Olea europaea subsp. Europaea, etc.).
- Seeds analyzed from six species (denoted with asterisk in the list).
- Soil samples: three collected.
- Samples stored cold, transported to the UK, then freeze-dried, weighed, and finely ground.

## Analytical methods
- Elemental analysis:
  - Digestion: ground samples digested with aqua regia (3:1 HNO3:HCl) at 175°C for 12 minutes using a microwave digestion system.
  - Measurement: ICPMS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) or ICPOES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy).
  - Modes: semi-quantitative (kinetic energy discrimination mode with He support) and quantitative (external calibration with Ga, In, Re as internal standards).
  - Calibration: internal standards correct for drift and matrix effects; LODs determined from reagent blanks; in some semi-quantitative cases, LODs estimated at 0.001 µg/L when blanks insufficient.
  - Results: reported as milligrams per kilogram dry mass (mg/kg d.m.).
- Radionuclide analysis:
  - Gamma emitters Be-7, Cs-137, and K-40 analyzed in soil and plant samples of sufficient mass.
  - Method: Hyper-pure germanium detectors, four-day counting per sample, efficiency-calibrated for sample density.
  - Calibration: mixed radionuclide standard covering 59–1850 keV; Canberra Apex software used for spectrum analysis; detector calibration includes density/volume standards and proficiency testing participation.
  - Results: reported as becquerels per kilogram dry mass (Bq/kg d.m.); minimum detectable activity (MDA) depends on detector, count time, sample type, and mass/volume.
- Data handling:
  - Concentrations below LOD/MDA reported with a < symbol.
  - Overall, details cover the mass of digested material, instrument modes, and calibration procedures to ensure traceability and comparability.

## Data reporting and units
- Elemental concentrations: mg/kg dry mass.
- Radionuclide activity concentrations: Bq/kg dry mass.
- Spatial and sample metadata include precise GPS coordinates (WG84), transect start/end, and sample identifiers.
- Documentation distinguishes between semi-quantitative and quantitative ICPMS/ICPOES measurements, with internal standards and calibration details provided.

## Data quality and limitations
- LODs and MDAs vary by instrument and method; semi-quantitative measurements may rely on extrapolated response curves.
- Some elements lacked usable LODs from blanks and thus used estimated LODs based on instrument sensitivity.
- Radionuclide detection depends on sample mass, count time, and detector performance; MDAs are reported per sample basis.
- Data are limited to samples collected along a single transect at one site, which may affect broader generalizability.

## Potential data reuse and governance considerations
- The dataset enables cross-species comparisons of elemental and radionuclide burdens in Mediterranean vegetation and associated soils.
- Suitable for environmental monitoring, ecological risk assessment, and baseline characterization of radionuclide distribution in a Spanish montane ecosystem.
- For data leaders: potential improvements include thorough metadata curation (the exact sample IDs, mass of each subsample, and complete instrument settings), data provenance, and explicit data sharing or repository deposition to enhance discoverability and reuse across networks. Consider establishing standardized metadata schemas (sampling context, processing steps, detection limits, and quality control records) to support collaboration and prevent data silos.
