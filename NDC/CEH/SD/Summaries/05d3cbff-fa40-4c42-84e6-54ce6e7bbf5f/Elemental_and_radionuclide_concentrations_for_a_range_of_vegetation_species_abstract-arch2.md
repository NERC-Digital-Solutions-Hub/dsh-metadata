# Elemental and radionuclide concentrations for several vegetation species from a site in Extremadura, Spain

## Aim
- Present elemental and radionuclide concentrations in freeze-dried Mediterranean plants, seeds, and soil from Monfragüe National Park, Extremadura, Spain.
- Provide data in a consistent format to support environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessments over time.

## Study design and location
- Sampling conducted in June 2014 along a transect in Monfragüe National Park, Cáceres, western Spain.
- Transect coordinates provided (start and end points in WG84).
- Plant material: 30 species; seeds from 6 species; 3 soil samples.
- Site represents diverse Mediterranean vegetation and soil relationships.

## Plant, seed, and soil sampling
- Plant species (examples): Agrostis pourretii, Campanula rapunculus, Taraxacum spp., Rumex scutatus, Hypericum perforatum, Crataegus monogyna, Pistacia terebinthus, Viburnum tinus, Cistus ladanifer, Ficus carica, Olea europaea subsp. Europaea, Vitis vinifera subsp. Sylvestris, among others.
- Seeds collected from selected species (marked with an asterisk in the original list).
- Soils: 3 samples.
- All samples stored cool for immediate transport to the UK, then freeze-dried and ground for analysis.

## Sample preparation
- Ground material homogenized and weighed for subsampling.
- Subsamples prepared for gamma analysis from plant and soil material with sufficient mass.
- Digestion: aqua regia (3:1 HNO3:HCl) digestion at 175°C for 12 minutes in a microwave (CEM MarsXpress).
- Remaining digests used for elemental analysis.

## Elemental analysis (ICPMS/ICPOES)
- Instrumentation: ICPMS (Perkin Elmer NexION 300D) and ICPOES (Perkin Elmer Optima 7300 DV).
- Measurement modes:
  - Semi-quantitative: rapid analysis across a wide mass range using a response curve.
  - Quantitative: external calibration with internal standardization (Ga, In, Re at 10 µg/L) to correct drift and matrix effects.
- Limit of detection (LOD):
  - Calculated from reagent blanks for each element; for some semi-quantitative determinations, LODs were not directly derivable and assigned a value of 0.001 µg/L (equivalent to 0.001 mg/kg in the sample context).
  - Total method LODs account for sample mass and digestion dilution.
- Data reporting: elemental concentrations in mg/kg dry mass.

## Radionuclide analysis (gamma spectroscopy)
- Radionuclides measured: Be-7, Cs-137, K-40.
- Samples with sufficient mass analyzed using hyper-pure germanium detectors for four days.
- Efficiency calibration using mixed radionuclide standards covering ~59–1850 keV; spectra analyzed with Canberra Apex software.
- Calibration included density/volume variations; laboratory participates in proficiency testing schemes.
- Minimum detectable activity (MDA) varies by sample, detector, counting time, and sample type.
- Data reporting: radionuclide activity concentrations in Bq/kg dry mass.

## Quality assurance and data handling
- Use of internal standards to mitigate instrument drift and matrix effects.
- Calibration and proficiency testing to ensure accuracy and comparability.
- Concentrations reported with < indicating values below LOD or MDA.

## Data interpretation and accessibility
- Elemental and radionuclide data provide baseline values for environmental monitoring in a Mediterranean ecosystem.
- Methods standardized to enable data comparability across datasets and over time.
- Data handling designed to support storage and eventual upload to appropriate environmental data portals, aligning with aims to increase dataset value and data accessibility.
