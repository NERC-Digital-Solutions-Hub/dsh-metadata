# Elemental and radionuclide concentrations for several vegetation species from a site in Extremadura, Spain

## Overview
- Systematically measured elemental and radionuclide concentrations in freeze-dried Mediterranean plants, seeds, and oven-dried soil from Monfragüe National Park, Cáceres, western Spain.
- Study ran in June 2014 along a transect; samples were processed and analyzed to determine concentrations and activity for a range of elements and gamma-emitting radionuclides.

## Study Design and Samples
- Samples collected:
  - 30 plant species (examples include Agrostis pourretii, Campanula rapunculus, Taraxacum sp., Taraxacum officinale, Rumex scutatus, Hypericum perforatum, Schoenoplectus pungens, Erica umbellata, Phillyrea angustifolia, Myrtus communis, Cytisus sp., Vitis vinifera subsp. Sylvestris, Crataegus monogyna, Daphne gnidium, Quercus ilex, Ruscus aculeatus, Olea europaea subsp. Europaea, Hordeum murinum, Pistacia terebinthus, Acer monspessulanum, Ficus carica, Cistus ladanifer, Eryngium campestre, Carlina vulgaris, Asparagus acutifolius, Viburnum tinus, Tamarix gallica, Jasminum fruticans, Rubia peregrine, Trifolium campestre)
  - Seeds from six species (marked with *).
  - Soil: 3 samples.
- Sampling details:
  - Transect along a Monfragüe National Park site (start: N 33 o 49' 47.2', W 006 o 01' 55.4'; end: N 39 0 49'46.8', W 006 0 02' 05.1'; WG84).
- Sample handling:
  - Samples stored cool, transported to the UK, freeze-dried, weighed, and ground with a vegetation mill.
  - Subsamples used for gamma analysis (plant samples n=16; soil samples n=3).
  - Remaining material digested with aqua regia (3:1 HNO3:HCl) at 175°C for 12 minutes via microwave digestion.

## Analytical Methods

### Elemental Analysis (ICPMS and ICPOES)
- Instruments: ICPMS (Perkin Elmer NeXION 300D) and ICPOES (Perkin Elmer Optima 7300 DV).
- Modes:
  - Semi-quantitative: extrapolated concentrations over a wide mass range using element concentration-to-intensity response curves; uses internal standardization by Ga, In, Re.
  - Quantitative: external calibration with internal standard corrections (Ga, In, Re) to compensate for drift and matrix effects.
- Calibration and detection:
  - External calibration with internal standards for drift/matrix effects.
  - Limits of detection (LOD) calculated from reagent blanks (mean ± 3 SD).
  - For elements where LOD could not be derived from blanks in semi-quantitative mode, instrument LOD was estimated as 0.001 µg L⁻¹ (assumed method LOD of 0.001 mg kg⁻¹).
  - Total method LODs adjusted for sample mass and digestion dilution.
- Reporting:
  - Elemental concentrations expressed as mg kg⁻¹ dry mass.

### Radionuclide Analysis (Gamma Spectrometry)
- Radionuclides analyzed: Be-7, K-40, Cs-137.
- Method:
  - Soil and plant samples of sufficient mass analyzed with hyper-pure germanium detectors for four days.
  - Efficiency calibration using a mixed radionuclide standard covering roughly 59–1850 keV; spectra analyzed with Canberra Apex software.
  - Detector calibration against standards of varying density and volume; participation in proficiency testing schemes.
- Reporting:
  - Radionuclide activity concentrations expressed as Bq kg⁻¹ dry mass.
  - Minimum detectable activity (MDA) varies by sample, detector, counting time, and sample characteristics.

## Data Quality, Handling, and Reporting
- Data quality:
  - Use of internal standards (Ga, In, Re) to correct for drift and matrix effects.
  - QA procedures include calibration, proficiency testing, and traceability back to standards.
- Data reporting conventions:
  - Concentrations at or below LOD/MDA are denoted with a "<" prefix.
  - All elemental data in mg kg⁻¹ dry mass; radionuclide data in Bq kg⁻¹ dry mass.
- Data provenance and metadata:
  - Detailed description of methods, instrument settings, and calibration approaches provided.
  - The study tracks data sources and notes potential for dataset discoverability via metadata-rich portals.

## Data Handling, Access, and Metadata
- Samples prepared and analyzed with thorough documentation of digestion procedures, instrument modes, and calibration strategies.
- Data are prepared for potential inclusion in data portals with metadata, enabling discoverability and reuse.
