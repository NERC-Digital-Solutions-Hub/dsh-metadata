# Radionuclide meta-data

- Overview
  - A data dictionary for radionuclide analysis from the CEH Radiochemistry laboratory.
  - Captures sample identifiers, sampling site and date, plant species or soil context, and analytical details.
  - Includes activity concentration measurements for K-40, Cs-137, Be-7 with related quality indicators and metadata.

- Key data fields and meanings
  - Sample identity and context
    - Sample_ID: unique sample identifier.
    - Sampling_Site: sampling location.
    - Sampling_date: date the plant or soil was sampled.
    - Analysed_date: date the sample was analysed (dd/mm/yyyy).
  - Taxonomy and sample description
    - Species: Latin name of the plant species (n/a if soil sample).
    - Common_name: common name if available (n/a if soil sample).
    - Order, Family, Genus: taxonomic categories (n/a for soil samples).
  - Sample characteristics
    - Mass_of_sample_g: mass of sample in grams (dry weight).
  - Analytical details
    - Analysis_time_days: duration of analysis in days.
  - Radionuclide activity concentrations and quality metrics
    - Activity_concentration_40K_Bq_kg_dry: K-40 activity concentration (Bq/kg dry weight).
    - Counting_error_40K_Bq_kg_dry: counting error for 40K concentration.
    - 40K_<: indicator (< present if concentration below LOD).
    - MDA_40K_Bq_kg_dry: minimum detectable activity for 40K.
    - Activity_concentration_1_37Cs_Bq_kg_dry: Cs-137 concentration (Bq/kg dry weight).
    - Counting_error_137Cs_Bq_kg_dry: counting error for Cs-137 concentration.
    - 137Cs_<: indicator (< present if concentration below LOD).
    - MDA_137Cs_Bq_kg_dry: minimum detectable activity for Cs-137.
    - 7Be_<: indicator (< present if Be-7 concentration below LOD).
    - MDA_7Be_Bq_kg_dry: minimum detectable activity for Be-7.
  - Notes
    - Notes: information related to samples that may impact reported results; otherwise not applicable.

- Data quality, standards, and interpretability
  - Units and formats
    - Mass_of_sample_g uses grams (dry weight).
    - Analysed_date uses dd/mm/yyyy.
    - Activity concentrations and MDAs use Bq per kg dry weight.
  - Data completeness and flags
    - LOD indicators (e.g., 40K_<, 137Cs_<, 7Be_<) flag values below detection.
    - Some fields may be not applicable for soil samples (n/a).
  - Provenance and lineage
    - Laboratory source specified as CEH Radiochemistry laboratory; implicit traceability to sample collection and analysis dates.

- Practical implications for Data Leaders
  - Data governance
    - Ensure consistent naming, units, and formats across the radionuclide dataset.
    - Maintain and harmonize LOD/MDA semantics for reliable interpretation.
  - Data quality and usability
    - Track mass, dates, and taxonomic metadata to enable cross-sample comparability.
    - Use notes to capture result-impacting context and potential data caveats.
  - Data discovery and collaboration
    - Rich metadata supports discoverability by researchers across plant/soil radiochemistry studies.
    - Clear structure enables integration with broader environmental data systems and communities of practice.
