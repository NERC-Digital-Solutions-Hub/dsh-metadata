# Elemental and radionuclide concentrations for several vegetation species from a site in Extremadura, Spain

## Overview
- Study of elemental and radionuclide concentrations in freeze-dried Mediterranean plants, seeds, and oven-dried soil.
- Samples collected in June 2014 along a transect within Monfragüe National Park, Cáceres, western Spain.
- Plant scope: 30 species; seeds analyzed from 6 species; soil samples analyzed as well.
- Targets: a broad suite of elements and selected gamma-emitting radionuclides (Be-7, Cs-137, K-40) in a subset of samples.

## Study Area and Sampling Details
- Location: Monfragüe National Park, province of Cáceres, western Spain.
- Transect coordinates (start to end) provided in WG84 GPS terms.
- Species collected include a diverse mix of grasses, herbs, shrubs, and trees; seeds collected from six species (subset indicated by asterisk in the list).
- Samples stored cool and transported to the UK for processing and analysis.

## Analytical Methods and Processing
- Sample preparation:
  - Plant samples freeze-dried, weighed, and finely ground.
  - Soil and plant digested with aqua regia (3:1 HNO3:HCl) at 175°C for 12 minutes using a microwave digestion system.
  - Subsamples taken for gamma analysis from plant samples with larger mass; remaining ground material digested.
- Elemental analysis:
  - Techniques: Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICPOES).
  - Modes: semi-quantitative (curve-based extrapolation over a wide mass range) and quantitative (external calibration).
  - Internal standards used to correct drift and matrix effects: Ga, In, and Re (spiked at 10 µg L⁻¹).
  - Limits of detection (LOD) calculated from reagent blanks; some semi-quantitative LODs estimated at 0.001 µg L⁻¹ when blanks were not informative.
  - Total method LODs account for sample mass and dilution from digestion.
- Radionuclide analysis:
  - Gamma-emitting radionuclides Be-7, Cs-137, and K-40 measured on soil and plant samples of sufficient mass.
  - Instrument: hyper-pure germanium detectors; four-day counting per sample with efficiency calibration for sample density.
  - Calibration: efficiency calibration with a mixed radionuclide standard across 59–1850 keV; density- and volume-matched standards used; software: Canberra Apex.
  - Quality control: detectors calibrated against density-varied standards and regular participation in proficiency tests.
- Data processing and reporting:
  - Elemental concentrations reported as mg kg⁻¹ dry mass.
  - Radionuclide activities reported as Bq kg⁻¹ dry mass.
  - Values at or below LOD/MDA flagged with a preceding “<”.

## Data Characteristics and Quality
- Units and reporting:
  - Elements: milligrams per kilogram dry mass.
  - Radionuclides: becquerels per kilogram dry mass.
- Handling non-detects:
  - Concentrations below LOD/MDA are flagged with “<” to indicate detection limits.
- QA and calibration:
  - Use of internal standards to mitigate drift and matrix effects.
  - Proficiency testing and efficiency calibrations for gamma detectors.
  - Detailed documentation of sample density, counting times, and detector performance to support data reliability.

## GIS-Relevant Data Considerations
- Georeferenced sampling along a defined transect with explicit start/end coordinates enables spatial mapping of elemental and radionuclide concentrations.
- Multi-dataset integration potential:
  - Combine plant species data, seed data, soil data, and radionuclide activities for spatial analyses.
  - Correlate concentration patterns with species distribution, soil properties, and environmental factors.
- Data harmonization needs:
  - Align units (mg kg⁻¹ vs other possible reporting units) and ensure consistent dry-mass basis.
  - Record method metadata (ICP-MS/ICPOES mode, internal standards, LODs) for reproducibility and proper interpretation in GIS contexts.
