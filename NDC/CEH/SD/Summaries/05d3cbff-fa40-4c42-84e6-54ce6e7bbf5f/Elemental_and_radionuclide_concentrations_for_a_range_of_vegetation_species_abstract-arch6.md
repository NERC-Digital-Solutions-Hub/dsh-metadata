# Elemental and radionuclide concentrations for several vegetation species from a site in Extremadura, Spain

## Overview
- Study of elemental and radionuclide concentrations in Mediterranean plants, seeds, and soil collected in June 2014 along a transect in Monfragüe National Park, Cáceres, western Spain.
- Samples included 30 plant species, seeds from 6 species, and 3 soil samples; some species seeds marked with an asterisk.
- Plant and soil samples analyzed for elemental concentrations using ICPMS or ICPOES; gamma-emitting radionuclides (Be-7, Cs-137, K-40) analyzed in plant and soil samples with gamma spectroscopy.

## Study design and samples
- transect start: N 33°49'47.2", W 006°01'55.4"; end: N 39°00'49.46", W 006°02'05.1" (WG84).
- Plant species list includes 30 taxa such as Agrostis pourretii, Campanula rapunculus, Taraxacum species, Rumex scutatus, Hypericum perforatum, Myrtus communis, Pistacia terebinthus, Viburnum tinus, Ficus carica, Quercus ilex, Olea europaea subsp. Europaea, Cistus ladanifer, and others.
- Samples were stored cool, transported to the UK, freeze-dried, weighed, and finely ground prior to analysis.
- Subsamples were taken for gamma analysis from plant samples (n=16) and the 3 soil samples.

## Analytical methods: elemental concentrations
- Digestion: ground material digested with aqua regia (3:1 HNO3:HCl, Aristar grade) at 175°C for 12 minutes in a microwave (CEM MarsXpress).
- Instrumentation: ICPMS (Perkin Elmer NexION 300D) and ICPOES (Perkin Elmer Optima 7300 DV).
- Measurement modes:
  - Semi-quantitative ICPMS in kinetic energy discrimination mode with helium.
  - Quantitative ICPMS/ICPOES with external calibration; internal standards (Ga, In, Re) added to correct for drift and matrix effects.
- Calibration and detection:
  - External calibration used; internal standards compensate for drift.
  - Instrument limits of detection (LODs) derived from reagent blanks; for some elements where blanks could not define LOD, a default LOD of 0.001 µg L^-1 was assigned.
  - Total method LODs account for sample mass and dilution from digestion.

## Analytical methods: radionuclides (gamma analysis)
- Be-7, K-40, Cs-137 activity concentrations determined for plant and soil samples with sufficient mass.
- Measurement: four days of counting on hyper-pure germanium detectors; efficiency calibration with a mixed radionuclide standard covering ~59–1850 keV; spectra analyzed with Canberra Apex software.
- Detector calibration:
  - Efficiency calibrated against standards of varying density and volume; routine participation in proficiency testing.
- Data handling: Minimum detectable activity (MDA) varies by sample, depending on detector, count time, sample type, and mass/volume.

## Data reporting and units
- Elemental concentrations reported as milligrams per kilogram dry mass (mg/kg dry mass).
- Radionuclide activities reported as becquerels per kilogram dry mass (Bq/kg dry mass).
- Values at or below LOD or MDA are indicated with a "<" prefix.

## Quality assurance and data reliability
- Use of internal standards (Ga, In, Re) to mitigate drift and matrix effects.
- Regular detector calibration and proficiency testing for gamma detectors.
- Efficiency calibration tied to sample density; adherence to QA/QC procedures across ICPMS/ICPOES and gamma analyses.

## Data availability and potential data products
- Provides a multi-taxa, multi-matrix dataset (plants, seeds, soil) with elemental and radionuclide measurements suitable for cross-species comparisons, environmental monitoring, and ecological studies.
- Data could support dashboards or reports showing distribution of elements and radionuclide activity across species and sample types, and inform environmental radiological assessments and biogeochemical investigations.
