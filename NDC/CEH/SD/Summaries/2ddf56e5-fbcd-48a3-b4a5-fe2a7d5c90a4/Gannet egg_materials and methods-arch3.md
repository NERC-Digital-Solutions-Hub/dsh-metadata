# 2.1. Egg sampling and analysis

- Study design and sampling
  - Fresh eggs were collected from ten gannet nests in each of two Scottish colonies (Ailsa Craig and Bass Rock) during each sampling year.
  - Eggs were collected by licensed egg collectors; measurements taken included weight, length, and breadth. Eggs were blown or cracked open; shells washed and air-dried; contents homogenised and stored at -20 °C.
  - From each year/colony, a random sub-group of five eggs was selected for PBDE analysis.

- Sample preparation and chemical analysis
  - A 2 g subsample of egg homogenate was thawed, weighed, dried with sodium sulfate, and spiked with 2.5 µL of 13C12-labelled recovery standard (final 50 pg/µL).
  - Soxhlet extraction performed for 16 h in 300 mL dichloromethane.
  - Lipids quantified gravimetrically from a 15 mL aliquot; remaining extract solvent-exchanged to hexane.
  - Clean-up included:
    - Two-step purification: (i) acidified silica gel column (2:1 activated silica:sulfuric acid) with hexane elution, (ii) gel permeation chromatography with biobeads in hexane:dichloromethane (1:1) for final cleanup.
  - Final extract transferred to GC vial with keeper (dodecane plus internal standards 13C12-labeled BDE77 and BDE138).
  - Analysis performed by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS, EI mode) on a CPSIL-8 CB column; calibrated with seven PBDE standards (2.5–250 pg/µL range).

- PBDE congeners measured and quality controls
  - 25 PBDE congeners (Tri–Octa) measured; recovered standards used to correct for recovery.
  - Instrument detection limits (LoD) ranged from 2.5 pg/µL (tri-hexa) to 12.5 pg/µL (Octa), corresponding to wet weight LoDs of approximately 0.061–0.305 ng/g.
  - 14 procedural blanks analyzed; concentrations in blanks below LoD.
  - Recoveries for 13C12-labelled BDE congeners (28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183) generally 68–83%.
  - Measured concentrations were correction-adjusted for recovery using the deuterated analogue/homologue.
  - QA/QC: a QC standard (five PBDEs across tri-hepta homologues, 2.5–250 pg/µL) analysed with unknowns; batches passed QA/QC if QC concentrations were within ±10% of expected values.
  - Nona-BDEs and BDE209 were not determined due to poor recovery with this GC-MS method; previous PBDE data (DecaBDE) in a subset (PBMS archive) showed concentrations below detection in all samples.

- Data handling and reporting
  - PBDE concentrations (ΣPBDE and individual congeners) reported on a wet weight basis and corrected for desiccation using total egg weight/volume ratio.
  - Egg volume estimated using V = 0.51 × L × B^2; if volumes could not be calculated (damaged eggs), mean ratio from year/colony used.
  - Two eggs (one from each colony/year) excluded where volume/weight ratios were >3 standard deviations from the mean.
  - Shell index (shell thickness proxy) calculated as shell weight (mg) / (shell length × breadth in mm); available only for eggs where shell index could be calculated (n = 46 Bass Rock, n = 35 Ailsa Craig).

- Statistical analyses
  - Data for congeners and ΣPBDEs presented on a wet weight basis and log10-transformed for analysis.
  - Temporal trends assessed with General Linear Model (GLM); year × colony interactions examined; post-hoc Tukey pairwise comparisons used for multiple comparisons.
  - Associations among PBDE congeners evaluated via Pearson correlation coefficients.
  - Overall associations between ΣPBDEs, congeners, and shell index or egg volume explored using multiple regression models.
  - Analyses including shell index restricted to eggs with calculable shell index (Bass Rock n = 46; Ailsa Craig n = 35).

- Key limitations
  - Nona-BDEs and BDE209 not measured due to poor recovery with the chosen method.
  - Some congeners below LoD treated as zero for sum calculations.
  - Partial data for shell index due to availability of measurements.
