# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme Egg Contaminant Data

## Overview
- Data underpin long-term temporal trend analyses conducted by the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS).
- Contains egg samples collected from seabird colonies, with a unique egg identifier, collection year, and site location.
- Includes shell thickness indicator and a broad panel of chemical contaminants to assess environmental exposure.

## Variables and Analytes
- Ref: Unique alpha-numeric egg identification code.
- Year: Year of egg collection.
- Site: Colony location.
- SHELL_INDEX: Indicator of eggshell thickness (units: mg/mm^2); NA if not analysed.
- HEOD: Concentration of a specific organochlorine compound in homogenised egg contents (units: µg/g wet weight); ND if none detected; NA if not analysed.
- DDE: Concentration of DDE in homogenised egg contents (units: µg/g wet weight); ND or NA as applicable.
- Hg: Total mercury in homogenised egg contents (units: µg/g dry weight); ND if not analysed.
- PCB: Total concentration related to PCBs (units: µg/g wet weight); ND or NA as applicable.
- PCB and individual congeners (e.g., PCB008, PCB018, PCB029, PCB028, PCB031, PCB052, PCB077, PCB101, PCB105, PCB114, PCB118, PCB123, PCB126, PCB128, PCB138, PCB149, PCB153, PCB156, PCB157, PCB167, PCB169, PCB170, PCB180, PCB189, PCB209, PCB141, PCB163, PCB171, PCB183, PCB187, PCB194, PCB199, PCB201, PCB205, PCB206): Concentrations in homogenised egg contents (units: µg/g wet weight); ND if not detected; NA if not analysed.
- Additional Information: Note that data are generated for PBMS long-term trend analyses; reports available on PBMS results page.

## Data Quality and Availability
- Some analytes are ND (None Detected) or NA (Not Analysed), reflecting varying analytical coverage.
- Data compiled from multiple sites with standardized metadata to enable cross-site comparisons and temporal analyses.
- Raw data and trend reports can be downloaded from the PBMS results site for further analysis.

## Access and Use
- PBMS results page: http://pbms.ceh.ac.uk/results.htm
- Data supports environmental monitoring and decision-making by correlating year, site, and contaminant trends in seabird eggs.

## Notes for Analysts
- Expect gaps where certain chemicals were not analysed or not detected.
- Units vary by analyte (e.g., shell thickness in mg/mm^2; contaminants in µg/g wet or dry weight); ensure consistent unit handling when aggregating data.
- Coordinate and align site metadata with analytical results to enable robust temporal and spatial trend analyses.
