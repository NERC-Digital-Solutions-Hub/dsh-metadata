# 2.1. Egg sampling and analysis

- Study design and sample collection
  - Fresh eggs were collected from ten gannet nests across two Scottish colonies (Ailsa Craig and Bass Rock) in each sampling year.
  - Measurements taken: egg weight, length, breadth; eggshells washed, air-dried, and reweighed; contents homogenised and stored at -20 °C.
  - A random sub-sample of five eggs per year per colony was selected for PBDE analysis.

- Sample preparation and PBDE analysis
  - A 2 g sub-sample of egg homogenate was spiked with 13C12-labelled recovery standards at 50 pg/µl.
  - Soxhlet extraction (16 h) in dichloromethane; lipid content determined gravimetrically.
  - Lipids removed via a two-step cleanup: acidified silica plug (hexane elution) and gel permeation chromatography (biobeads; hexane:dichloromethane 1:1).
  - Final extract transferred to GC-MS vial with keeper (dodecane and internal standards 13C12-BDE congeners 28 and 183).
  - GC-MS analysis conducted on a 30 m CPSIL-8 CB column; calibration with seven PBDE standards; 25 congeners targeted (tri-Octa BDEs; including congeners 17, 28, 32, 35, 37, 47, 49, 66, 71, 75, 77, 85, 99, 100, 119, 138, 153, 154, 166, 183, 190, 196, 197; plus 51, 128 from additional standards).
  - Instrument LoD ranged from 2.5 pg/µl (tri-hexa BDEs) to 12.5 pg/µl (Octa BDEs); these corresponded to mean wet-weight LoD values of 0.061–0.305 ng/g.
  - 14 procedural blanks were analyzed; blank concentrations were below LoD.
  - Recovery corrections applied using 13C12-labelled BDEs; mean recoveries for congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 ranged 68–83%.
  - A QC standard (five PBDEs across 2.5–250 pg/µl) was analyzed with unknowns; batches passed QC if concentrations were within ±10% of expected values.
  - Note: Nona BDEs and BDE209 were not determined due to poor GC-MS recovery; previous PBDE data (DecaBDE) from the PBMS archive were below detection in all samples.

- Data handling and calculations
  - PBDE concentrations reported on a wet-weight basis and corrected for desiccation using total egg weight/volume ratio.
  - Egg volume estimated with V = 0.51 × L^2 × B; when damaged eggs prevented calculation, the mean volume/weight ratio for that year or colony was used.
  - Eggshell index calculated as shell weight (mg) / (shell length × breadth in mm).
  - ΣPBDE calculated as the sum of all 25 determined congeners; concentrations below LoD treated as zero.

- Data processing and statistical approach
  - All concentrations log10-transformed to satisfy assumptions of variance and normality.
  - Temporal trends evaluated with General Linear Models; colony/year interactions assessed with Tukey post-hoc tests.
  - Associations among PBDE congeners assessed via Pearson correlations.
  - Relationships between ΣPBDEs/congeners and shell index or egg volume explored with multiple regression; shell-index analyses limited to eggs with calculable shell index (Bass Rock n=46; Ailsa Craig n=35).

- Practical implications for data stewardship
  - Ensure complete metadata for each sample (colony, year, egg identifiers, weight/volume, L, B, volume estimates, shell index).
  - Document QC metrics (LoD, recoveries, blanks, QC standard results) and correction factors used.
  - Record method details (solvent volumes, cleanup steps, GC-MS parameters) to enable reproducibility and data re-use.
  - Acknowledge limitations (incomplete congener coverage due to method; damaged eggs; missing shell index data) and indicate how such data gaps were handled.
