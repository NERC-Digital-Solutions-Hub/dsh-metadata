# 2.1. Egg sampling and analysis

- Study design
  - Fresh eggs collected from ten gannet nests in each sampling year at two Scottish colonies: Ailsa Craig and Bass Rock.
  - Licensed egg collectors; eggs weighed, measured (weight, length, breadth); shells washed, air-dried, reweighed; contents homogenised and stored at -20°C.
  - A sub-sample of five eggs per year per colony chosen randomly for PBDE analysis.

- PBDE analysis workflow
  - 2 g sub-sample of egg homogenate thawed, weighed, dried, spiked with 13C12-labelled recovery standard (50 pg/µL).
  - Soxhlet extraction for 16 h in dichloromethane; lipid content determined gravimetrically.
  - Extracts cleaned: acidified silica column (eluted with hexane) → reduced volume → gel permeation chromatography with biobeads (hexane:dichloromethane 1:1) → final transfer to GC vial with keeper (dodecane + 13C12 BDE internal standards 77 and 183).
  - Analysis by GC-MS (EI) on CPSIL-8 CB column; calibration with seven PBDE standards (2.5–250 pg/µL).
  - Targeted congeners: 25 PBDE tri-Octa congeners (list provided); Nona BDEs and BDE209 not measured due to poor recovery.
  - Quality control: 14 procedural blanks per batch (concentrations below LoD); recovery of 13C12-labelled BDEs (28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183) 68–83%; QC standard (five PBDEs) run per batch; batches pass QC if QC concentrations within ±10% of expected.
  - Concentrations in samples corrected for recovery; non-detects assigned zero for ΣPBDE calculation.
  - Historical data: DecaBDE data from a subset of eggs previously analysed; concentrations below LoD in those samples.

- Measurement details
  - Instrument LoD ranged from 2.5 pg/µL (tri-hexa BDEs) to 12.5 pg/µL (Octa BDEs); corresponding average egg wet-weight LoDs: ~0.061–0.305 ng/g.
  - 14 blanks analyzed per batch; all blank concentrations below LoD.

- Notes
  - Nona BDEs and BDE209 not determined in this study due to method limitations; some archived data indicate concentrations below detection limits.

## 2.2. Statistical analyses

- Data handling and transformation
  - PBDE congeners and ΣPBDEs expressed on a wet weight basis; concentrations corrected for desiccation using total egg weight/volume.
  - Egg volume estimated as V = 0.51 × L^2 × B (L = length, B = breadth); when damaged eggs prevented calculation, mean volume/weight ratios from year or colony used.
  - Shell index calculated as shell weight (mg) / (shell length × breadth (mm)).
  - ΣPBDE = sum of the 25 measured congeners; below-LoD values treated as zero.
  - Data log10-transformed to satisfy homogeneity of variance and normality (Levene’s test and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test).

- Analyses
  - Temporal trends: General Linear Model (GLM); colony × year interactions assessed with Tukey post-hoc tests.
  - Associations: Pearson correlations for congeners’ interrelationships; multiple regression to explore relationships between ΣPBDEs, individual congeners, and shell index or egg volume.
  - Shell index analyses limited to samples with calculable shell index (Bass Rock n=46; Ailsa Craig n=35).
