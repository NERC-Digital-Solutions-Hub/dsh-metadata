# 2.1. Egg sampling and analysis

## Sampling design and samples
- Fresh eggs collected from ten gannet nests per sampling year across two Scottish colonies: Ailsa Craig and Bass Rock.
- For each colony and year, measurements taken: egg weight, length, breadth; contents homogenised and stored at -20 °C.
- A sub-sample of five eggs per year per colony randomly selected for PBDE analysis.

## Laboratory methods for PBDE analysis
- Sub-sample (2 g) thawed, weighed, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, spiked with 13C12-labelled internal standard (50 pg/μL) for recovery.
- Soxhlet extraction for 16 h in dichloromethane; lipid content determined gravimetrically.
- Extracts cleaned via:
  - Acidified silica column (2:1 activated silica to conc. sulfuric acid) with hexane elution.
  - Rotary evaporation and solvent exchange to hexane.
  - Gel permeation chromatography with biobeads, hexane:dichloromethane (1:1) elution.
- Final extract prepared with keeper (dodecane + internal standards 13C12-BDE congeners) and analyzed by GC-MS (EI mode) using a CPSIL-8 CB column.
- Calibration with 7 PBDE standards (range 2.5–250 pg/μL); 25 PBDE congeners analyzed (Tri-Octa: 17, 28, 32, 35, 37, 47, 49, 66, 71, 75, 77, 85, 99, 100, 119, 138, 153, 154, 166, 183, 190, 196, 197; plus 51, 128 from other sources).
- Instrument LoDs: 2.5 pg/μL (tri-hexa), 5 pg/μL (BDE183), 12.5 pg/μL (Octa); corresponding ng/g wet weight LoDs calculated per sample weight.
- QC: 14 procedural blanks; mean blanks below LoD. Recovery of 13C12-labeled congeners (28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183) 68–83%. Measured concentrations corrected for recovery using deuterated analogues.
- QC standard (five PBDEs covering tri-hepta homologues) run with unknowns; batches passed QC if concentrations within ±10% of expected values.
- Nona-BDEs and BDE209 not measured due to poor recovery with the method used; DecaBDE data from archived samples (Leslie et al., 2011) showed concentrations below LoD.

## Data handling and measurements
- PBDE concentrations reported on a wet weight basis and corrected for desiccation: multiply by total egg weight/volume.
- Egg volume estimated with V = 0.51 × L × B^2 (L = length, B = breadth).
- Some eggs damaged; volume/weight ratios for those eggs could not be calculated; missing data addressed via colony/year mean ratios where needed.
- Eggshell index computed as shell weight (mg) / (shell length × breadth in mm).

## Statistical analyses
- Congener sums: ΣPBDE = sum of all 25 determined congeners; congeners below LoD set to zero.
- Data transformation: log10-transformed to satisfy homogeneity of variance (Levene) and normality (Kolmogorov–Smirnov).
- Temporal trends: General Linear Model (GLM).
- Year–colony interactions: post-hoc Tukey pairwise tests.
- Associations among PBDE congeners: Pearson correlation.
- Relationships between ΣPBDEs/congeners and shell index or egg volume: multiple regression.
- Shell index analyses (where possible) included for n = 46 (Bass Rock) and n = 35 (Ailsa Craig).
- 3 eggs excluded from analyses due to extreme volume/weight deviation ( > 3 SD from the mean).

## Key notes and limitations
- Nona-BDEs and BDE209 not quantified with this method; historical DecaBDE data in a sub-sample indicate levels below detection.
- Data handling includes conservative zeroing of values below detection and desiccation adjustments to ensure comparability across eggs.
