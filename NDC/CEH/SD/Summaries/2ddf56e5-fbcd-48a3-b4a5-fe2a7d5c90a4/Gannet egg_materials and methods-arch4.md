# 2.1. Egg sampling and analysis

- Study design: fresh eggs collected by licensed egg collectors from ten gannet nests at two Scottish colonies (Ailsa Craig and Bass Rock) across sampling years. A sub-group of five eggs per year per colony randomly selected for PBDE analysis.
- Sample handling: eggs weighed, measured (weight, length, breadth), and contents homogenised; shells washed, air-dried, reweighed; contents stored at -20 °C until analysis.
- PBDE sub-sampling: 2 g sub-sample of each egg homogenate thawed, weighed, dried, and spiked with 13C12-labelled recovery standard (final 50 pg/µL). Soxhlet extraction for 16 h in 300 mL dichloromethane.
- Lipid and cleanup workflow: lipids gravimetrically quantified from a 15 mL aliquot; extract split for cleanup—first on an acidified silica column (eluted with hexane), then concentrated to <1 mL; second cleanup by gel permeation chromatography with biobeads (hexane:dichloromethane 1:1). Collected fraction dried and transferred to GC vial with keeper (dodecane + internal standards 13C12-BDE congeners).
- GC-MS analysis: 25 PBDE congeners measured using GC-MS (EI mode) on a 30 m CPSIL-8 CB column; calibration with seven PBDE standards spanning 2.5–250 pg/µL. Congeners analyzed: BDEs 17, 28, 32, 35, 37, 47, 49, 66, 71, 75, 77, 85, 99, 100, 119, 138, 153, 154, 166, 183, 190, 196, 197, plus 51 and 128 from another supplier.
- Detection limits and recovery: instrument LoD ranges 2.5 pg/µL (tri-hexa) to 12.5 pg/µL (Octa BDEs); corresponding wet weight LoD ~0.061–0.305 ng/g. 14 procedural blanks had concentrations below LoD. Recoveries for 13C12-labelled congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 ranged 68–83% across groups.
- Quantification and quality control: PBDE concentrations corrected for recovery using the deuterated surrogate. QC standard (five PBDEs across 2.5–250 pg/µL) analysed with unknowns; batches passed QC if QC concentrations were within ±10% of expected values.
- Limitations: Nona BDEs and BDE209 not measured due to poor recovery with the method used. A sub-sample (12 gannet eggs) from PBMS archive previously analysed for DecaBDE showed concentrations below detection in all samples.
- Data processing (wet weight): PBDE concentrations reported on a wet weight basis and corrected for desiccation using total egg weight/volume ratio. Egg volume estimated as V = 0.51 × L × B^2 (L = length, B = breadth). Damaged eggs were adjusted using colony/year mean ratios when necessary; three eggs excluded if volume/weight ratios were >3 standard deviations from the mean.
- Shell index: calculated as shell weight (mg) / (shell length × breadth in mm); usable only for eggs where this could be calculated (Bass Rock n=46; Ailsa Craig n=35).
- Data handling for congeners: concentrations below LoD treated as zero for ΣPBDE calculations. Data were log10-transformed to meet assumptions of variance homogeneity and normality for subsequent analyses.
- Scope of analyses: prepared to assess temporal trends (GLM with Tukey post-hoc for colony/year interactions), associations among PBDE congeners (Pearson correlations), and relationships between PBDEs and egg characteristics (multiple regression with shell index or egg volume).

# 2.2. Statistical analyses

- Data presentation: individual PBDE congener and ΣPBDE concentrations analyzed on a wet-weight basis; desiccation corrections applied via egg weight/volume ratio.
- Volume and shell metrics: egg volume estimated using L and B; shell index used as a proxy for shell thickness where calculable.
- Data handling: values below LoD assigned zero for ΣPBDE calculations; log10 transformations applied to stabilize variance and meet normality assumptions.
- Trend and group analyses: temporal trends analyzed with General Linear Models (GLM); colony and year interactions explored with post-hoc Tukey tests.
- Inter-congener relationships: Pearson correlation coefficients used to assess associations among PBDE congeners.
- Relationships with egg traits: multiple regression models examined whether ΣPBDEs or individual congeners relate to shell index or egg volume. Shell-index analyses limited to eggs with calculable shell index data.
- Quality and limitations: non-detected congeners set to zero; partial measurement set (Nona BDEs and BDE209 not recovered) may limit full congener profiling; data corrections (recovery, desiccation) applied to strengthen comparability across samples.
