# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme – Egg Contaminant Dataset Description

- Purpose
  - Describes egg contaminant data collected under the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) for long-term temporal trend analyses.
  - Data suitable for GIS mapping and map-based visualisations of contaminant levels by site and year.

- Spatial and temporal scope
  - Spatial: egg collection sites listed as Site 0 to Site 7 with site names and location references (e.g., Site 0 Ailsa Craig; Site 6 Little Skellig with coordinates; Site 7 Great Saltee with coordinates). Location references include grid codes (e.g., NX019997) and latitude/longitude in some entries.
  - Temporal: Year field (four-digit year) indicates the collection year.

- Dataset structure and key variables
  - ID fields
    - Ref, Description: Unique alpha-numeric egg identification code.
  - Time and place
    - Year (4-digit): Year the egg was collected.
    - Site, Description: Location of the colony where the egg was collected (Site 0–7 with named locations and grid/coords).
  - Shell index
    - SHELL_INDEX: Indicator of eggshell thickness (mg/mm²); NA if not analysed.
  - Contaminants (concentrations in egg contents)
    - HEOD: Concentration in homogenised egg contents (µg/g wet weight); NA if not analysed; None Detected (ND) if applicable.
    - DDE: Concentration in homogenised egg contents (µg/g wet weight); ND/NA as applicable.
    - PCB: Total concentration of PCBs (µg/g wet weight); ND/NA as applicable.
    - Hg: Total mercury concentration (µg/g dry weight); ND/NA as applicable.
  - Individual PCB congeners (concentrations in homogenised egg contents; units: µg/g wet weight)
    - PCB008, PCB018, PCB029, PCB028, PCB031, PCB052, PCB077, PCB101, PCB105, PCB114, PCB118, PCB123, PCB126, PCB128, PCB138, PCB149, PCB153, PCB156, PCB157, PCB167, PCB169, PCB170, PCB180, PCB189, PCB209, PCB141, PCB163, PCB171, PCB183, PCB187, PCB194, PCB199, PCB201, PCB205, PCB206
    - Each congener has status indicators: NA - Not Analysed; ND - None Detected; otherwise concentration value (µg/g wet weight).
  - Additional Information
    - Describes PBMS data usage for long-term trend analyses and provides PBMS results link.

- Data quality and gaps
  - Many fields show ND (None Detected) or NA (Not Analysed), indicating incomplete analyses across sites/years.
  - Some site coordinates are provided; others are described by site name and grid reference, implying variable spatial resolution.

- Provenance and access
  - Data generated by the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme.
  - Long-term trend reports and data downloadable from the PBMS website: http://pbms.ceh.ac.uk/results.htm

- GIS considerations and usage tips
  - Suitable for map-based visualization by year and site to show spatial patterns and temporal trends in contaminant levels.
  - Handle missing/ND/NA values appropriately (e.g., treat as gaps in maps and time series).
  - Combine with site geometry (points) or basemaps; use grid references or coordinates to place sites accurately.
  - Be mindful of unit consistency across contaminants (primarily µg/g wet weight for PCBs and DDE, HEOD; shell index in mg/mm²; Hg in µg/g dry weight).
