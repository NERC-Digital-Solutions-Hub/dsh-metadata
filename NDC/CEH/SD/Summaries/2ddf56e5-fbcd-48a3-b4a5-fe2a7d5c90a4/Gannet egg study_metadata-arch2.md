# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme Egg Chemistry Dataset

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset generated by the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) to support long-term temporal trend analyses of environmental contaminants in eggs.
  - Intended for standardized data collection, verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and storage for broad environmental monitoring and policy scrutiny.

- Data structure and key fields
  - Ref, Description: Unique alpha-numeric egg identification code.
  - Year: Year the egg was collected.
  - Site: Location of the colony where the egg was collected; includes multiple sites with precise coordinates (e.g., Ailsa Craig, Bass Rock, St Kilda, Grassholm, Scar Rocks, Hermness, Little Skellig, Great Saltee) across the UK and Ireland.
  - Shell_index: Indication of eggshell thickness; units mg/mm2; ND (Not Analysed) if not measured.
  - HEOD: Concentration in homogenised egg contents; units ng/g (wet weight); ND or ND-None Detected; CAS 60-57-1.
  - DDE: Concentration in homogenised egg contents; units ng/g (wet weight); ND; CAS 72-55-9.
  - PCB: Total concentration of PCB-related peaks (excluding OC peaks) relative to an Aroclor 1254 standard; units ng/g (wet weight); ND.
  - Hg: Total mercury concentration in homogenised egg contents; units ng/g (dry weight); ND; CAS 92786-62-4.
  - PCB congener list (e.g., PCB008, PCB018, PCB029, PCB028, PCB031, PCB052, PCB077, PCB101, PCB105, PCB114, PCB118, PCB123, PCB126, PCB128, PCB138, PCB149, PCB153, PCB156, PCB157, PCB167, PCB169, PCB170, PCB180, PCB189, PCB209, PCB141, PCB163, PCB171, PCB183, PCB187, PCB194, PCB199, PCB201, PCB205, PCB206): Concentrations in homogenised egg contents; units ng/g (wet weight); many listed as ND (None Detected) or NA (Not Analysed); each with associated CAS numbers.
  - Additional Information: Notes that the data are part of PBMS and that reports for long-term trends can be downloaded from the PBMS results site.

- Units and analysis status
  - Shell_index: mg/mm2 (shell thickness indicator); ND when not analysed.
  - HEOD, DDE, PCB congeners, PCB total: ng/g or ng/g (wet weight) for most congeners; some entries ND or NA.
  - Hg: ng/g (dry weight).
  - Detection status: ND (None Detected), NA (Not Analysed).

- Geographic and temporal coverage
  - Spatial: Multiple seabird colonies around the British Isles and Ireland with precise site coordinates.
  - Temporal: Data collected across multiple years for long-term trend analyses (PBMS focus).

- Access and usage
  - This dataset supports standardized output formats (reports, maps, charts) and is intended for storage in appropriate data portals.
  - PBMS reports and results are available for download at the PBMS results site (http://pbms.ceh.ac.uk/results.htm).

- Key considerations for analysts
  - Data quality: Emphasizes verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation using standardised methods.
  - Data integration: Encouraged to increase dataset value by combining with other relevant data and enabling access to underlying data used to generate final outputs.
  - Long-term value: Supports temporal trend analyses to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
