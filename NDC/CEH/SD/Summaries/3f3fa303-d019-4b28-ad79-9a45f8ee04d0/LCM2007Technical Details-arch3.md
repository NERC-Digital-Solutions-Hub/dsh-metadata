# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- Land Cover Map 2007 is available in multiple formats to meet different user requirements.
- Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).

## Data Formats

### Vector Data
- Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata about its derivation.
- Minimum Mappable Unit: 0.5 hectares.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.

### Raster Data
- Five raster products in total.
- 25 x 25 m raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarize the 25 x 25 m raster data.
- Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Raster scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
- Supply format: GeoTIFF.
- Coverage: UK.

## Documentation and Metadata
- Further information available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation, including:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

## Access and Use in Monitoring Frameworks
- The data support spatial monitoring of land cover and habitat distribution for environmental health assessments.
- Metadata and documentation enable assessment of data quality, provenance, and suitability for specific indicators.
- The existence of both detailed vector data and coarser raster products allows selection of appropriate scale and method for monitoring indicators and informing policy decisions.
