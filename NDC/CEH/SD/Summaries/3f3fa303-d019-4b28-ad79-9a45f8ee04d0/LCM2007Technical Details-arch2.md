# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview
- LCM2007 is provided in multiple formats to accommodate different user needs.
- Covers the UK and includes both detailed vector data and summarized raster data.
- Documentation and metadata accompany the datasets to support correct use and interpretation.

## Vector data
- Minimum Mapable Unit: 0.5 ha
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile
- Coverage: UK
- Each polygon represents a land parcel with land cover attributes and metadata describing how the information was derived (see Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation)

## Raster data
- Five raster products in total
- 25 x 25 m raster: indicates the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarize the 25 x 25 m raster
- Supply format: GeoTiff
- Coverage: UK
- Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation

## Further information
- Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation contains:
  - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes for LCM2007
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets

## Relevance for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
