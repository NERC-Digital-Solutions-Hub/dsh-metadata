# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

- Purpose and formats
  - LCM2007 is provided in multiple formats to meet diverse user needs.
  - Supports both detailed and generalized analyses through vector and raster products.
- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: vector polygons representing land cover parcels.
  - Each polygon has attributes describing land cover and metadata describing derivation.
  - Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectares.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).
- Raster data
  - Five raster products available to summarize the information.
  - A 25 x 25 metre raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarize the 25 x 25 m data.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
  - Supply format: GeoTiff.
  - Coverage: UK.
- Documentation and metadata
  - Detailed metadata for raster formats in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
  - Further information available in the same document, including:
    - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
    - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
    - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets.
- Data governance and stewardship considerations
  - Availability in multiple formats supports discoverability and reuse across systems.
  - Detailed metadata and class descriptions facilitate standardization and interoperability.
  - Documentation provides the necessary context for data creators, maintainers, and users to ensure consistent interpretation and use.
- Practical notes for data custodians
  - Align data sharing with the documentation to maintain consistency between vector and raster representations.
  - Ensure access to both vector (Shapefile) and raster (GeoTiff) formats is maintained, with attention to license terms where applicable.
  - Use the provided tables and metadata to support data quality assessments and dataset integration.
