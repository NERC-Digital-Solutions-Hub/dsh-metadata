# Documentation of shortlist of soil-based greenhouse gas removal practices selected following consideration of biophysical, economic and social impacts

- Purpose
  - Presents a short list of soil-based greenhouse gas removal (GGR) practices targeting soil carbon sequestration (SCS) in agricultural land.
  - Addresses knowledge gaps related to environmental heterogeneity and variations in agricultural practices that affect practical implementation of SCS.
  - Based on a multidisciplinary analysis of practices already proposed to deliver SCS, and considers biophysical, economic, and social impacts.

- Data structure and content
  - Data table includes: crop, region, climate implications, crop rotation, case study, and harvested area (ha); each row links a practice to its context and data source.
  - Table 1 (data key) uses a 1–5 importance scale (High, Medium, Low) and special codes (n/a, ?).

  - Table 2 (data header and descriptions) fields include:
    - ID, description (crop type)
    - IMAGE_region (region or country where measures are applied)
    - Representative_of? (more specific crop type for the region)
    - Rotated_with? (crop used in rotation)
    - Case_study_country (country for measures)
    - Area_harvested_ha (area in hectares)

- Practices and measures
  - A long list of potential GGR measures is organized under erosion control, nutrient and soil management, and extended perennial phases.
  - Extended_perennial_phase umbrella includes: reduced bare fallow, cover crops, deep-rooted plants, nutrient management, organic amendments (grass-to-crops), residue management, biochar, pH management, reduced/no till, water management, wetland management, agroforestry, and hedges.
  - Each measure includes a dedicated data comment and data source reference, indicating how the measure is implemented and documented in the dataset.

- Assessment approach
  - Identify practices with potential positive SCS impact at the farm level and uptake rates compatible with meaningful global impact.
  - Focus areas for improvement and potential co-benefits:
    - Optimising crop productivity (nutrient use, pH, irrigation)
    - Reducing soil disturbance and improving soil physical properties (rotations, minimum till)
    - Minimising carbon losses via erosion or deliberate C removal
    - Adding carbon inputs from outside the system (organic amendments, biochar)
    - Providing additional carbon inputs within cropping systems (agroforestry, cover crops)
  - Consider economic and non-cost barriers, incentives for land managers, and externalities of implementation.
  - Evaluate whether existing scientific methods can quantify technical potential and externalities, and identify barriers and incentives for adoption in global agricultural systems.
  - Final shortlist developed through a broader literature review and expert panel input.

- Process and sources
  - Based on a multidisciplinary process and a synthesis of practices proposed for SCS.
  - Detailed descriptions and justification linked to data are documented in the source: Sykes et al. 2020 (Characterising the biophysical, economic and social impacts of soil carbon sequestration as a greenhouse gas removal technology).
  - Related foundational references include Macleod et al. 2015 (cost-effectiveness of greenhouse gas mitigation measures for agriculture).

- Data governance and relevance for data leadership
  - The dataset emphasizes clear data fields, justification comments, and explicit data sources to support transparency and usability.
  - The structure supports identification of data gaps, standardization needs, and targeted data collection to improve coverage and quality.
  - Enables collaboration and co-ownership of data products by users such as policy colleagues, researchers, and cross-sector partners.
