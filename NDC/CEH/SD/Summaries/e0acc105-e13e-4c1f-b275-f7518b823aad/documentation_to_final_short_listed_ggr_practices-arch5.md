# Documentation of shortlist of soil-based greenhouse gas removal practices selected following consideration of biophysical, economic and social impacts

## Overview
- Presents a shortlisted set of soil-based greenhouse gas removal (GGR) practices aimed at enhancing soil carbon sequestration (SCS) and addressing environmental heterogeneity, with consideration of biophysical, economic, and social impacts.
- Focuses on how these practices can be implemented in agricultural systems and their potential farm- and global-scale impacts.

## Data structure and schema

### Table 1: Key for data
- Indicates importance levels for data cells: 1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low.
- n/a = Not applicable; ? = Further suggestions needed.
- Note: Justification for priority choices is captured in row/cell comments.

### Table 2: Header in file with a short description
- Defines the dataset fields and their descriptions, enabling consistent data capture and interpretation. Core fields include:
  - ID, description: crop type
  - IMAGE_region: region or country where measures are applied
  - Representative_of?: more specific crop type for the region
  - Rotated_with?: crop for rotation
  - Case_study_country: country where measures are applied
  - Area_harvested_ha: area in hectares
  - Erosion_control and associated comment_1: data source and notes
  - Fire_management and comment_2: data source and notes
  - Stocking_density and comment_3: data source and notes
  - Pasture_renovation and comment_4: data source and notes
  - Sward_management and comment_5: data source and notes
  - Extend_perennial_phase and comment_6: data source and notes
  - Reduce_bare_fallow, Cover_crops, Deep_rooted_plants, Nutrient_management, Organic_amendment_inc_grass_to_crops, Residue_management, Add_biochar, pH_management, Reduced_no_till, Water_management, Wetland_management, Agroforestry, Hedges, each paired with a corresponding comment field (comment_7 to comment_19) detailing data sources.

- The dataset structure supports a wide range of soil-based GGR measures organized under the Extend_perennial_phase group, including:
  - Cover crops, deep-rooted plants, nutrient management, organic amendments, residue management, biochar addition, pH management, tillage practices, water and wetland management, agroforestry, and hedges.

## Data governance and provenance (relevance for Data Stewards)
- Each measure includes a comment field intended to capture the specific data source and notes, supporting data provenance and traceability.
- The structure anticipates heterogeneous data sources and formats, highlighting the need for clear metadata and consistent interpretation across systems.
- Emphasizes documentation of justification and priority within the data (via the Table 1 and cell comments), aiding reproducibility and governance.
- Prepared for updates and potential embargo considerations, with explicit fields for data that may require careful sharing or timing (e.g., case study specifics, regional applicability).

## Method and data

### Purpose
- To address knowledge gaps in environmental heterogeneity and practice differences that affect the practical implementation of soil carbon sequestration (SCS) as a GGR technology.

### Assessment aims
1. Identify practices with potential positive farm-level SCS impact and uptake rates compatible with global impact targets.
2. Focus on:
   - Optimising crop productivity (nutrient management, pH management, irrigation)
   - Reducing soil disturbance and improving soil physical properties (better rotations, minimum till)
   - Minimising deliberate carbon removal or erosion-driven carbon loss
   - Adding carbon produced outside the system (organic manures, biochar)
   - Providing additional carbon inputs within the cropping system (agroforestry, cover crops)
3. Consider economic and non-cost barriers and externalities, plus potential external impacts of implementation.
4. Evaluate whether existing scientific approaches can quantify technical potential and externalities, and identify barriers/incentives to global adoption.

### Outcome
- A final short list of soil-based GGR practices derived from a wide literature review and expert panel input.
- Detailed justification and methodology are described in the supporting literature.
