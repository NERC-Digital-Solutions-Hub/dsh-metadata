# Documentation of shortlist of soil-based greenhouse gas removal practices selected following consideration of biophysical, economic and social impacts

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents a data structure and methodology for a short-listed set of soil-based greenhouse gas removal (GGR) practices aimed at increasing soil carbon sequestration (SCS) in agricultural land.
  - Considers biophysical, economic, and social impacts; builds on multidisciplinary analysis of practices proposed to deliver SCS.

- Data structure and fields
  - Table 1: Key for data
    - Importance ratings: 1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low; n/a = Not applicable; ? = Further suggestions needed.
    - Comments provide justification for priority or rating at each grid cell.
  - Table 2: Header in file with a short description
    - Defines fields and descriptions for each data record, including:
      - ID, description; Crop; REGION or country (IMAGE_region); Representative_of?; Rotated_with?; Case_study_country; Area_harvested_ha.
      - Measures and related data fields for each practice, such as:
        - Erosion_control, Fire_management, Stocking_density, Pasture_renovation, Sward_management.
        - Extend_perennial_phase and associated measures (e.g., Reduce_bare_fallow, Cover_crops, Deep_rooted_plants, Nutrient_management, Organic_amendment_inc_grass_to_crops, Residue_management, Add_biochar, pH_management, Reduced_no_till, Water_management, Wetland_management, Agroforestry, Hedges).
      - For each measure: a corresponding comment field (e.g., comment_1, comment_2, …) capturing data source and notes.
  - Data captured across crops/regions/case studies, including area harvested (ha) and specific measures applied in each context.

- Measures and potential impacts captured
  - Erosion control, fire management, stocking density, pasture renovation, and sward management as baseline agronomic practices.
  - Extended perennial phase measures, with sub-measures addressing:
    - Reduced bare fallow; cover crops; deep-rooted plants; nutrient management; organic amendments (grass-to-crop lands); residue management; biochar addition; pH management; tillage reduction (reduced till/no-till); water management; wetland management; agroforestry; hedges.
  - Each measure includes descriptive data and a data-source comment to support traceability and quality checks.

- Methodology for shortlisting
  - Identification of practices with potential to positively affect farm-level SCS and with uptake rates compatible with broader climate impact.
  - Organizes focus around:
    - Optimizing crop productivity (nutrient optimization, pH management, irrigation).
    - Reducing soil disturbance and improving soil physical properties (rotations, minimum till).
    - Minimizing carbon losses via erosion or removal.
    - Adding external carbon inputs (organic amendments, biochar).
    - Providing additional within-system carbon inputs (agroforestry, cover crops).
  - Long list based on Macleod et al. 2015; final shortlist derived from a broader literature review and expert panel input.
  - Assessment also considers economic and non-cost barriers, externalities, and the ability of existing methods to quantify potential and barriers to implementation in global systems.
  - Detailed description and justification available in the referenced sources.

- Outputs and purpose for data use
  - A structured, queryable dataset outlining which soil-based GGR practices are shortlisted, with context on crops, regions, and case studies.
  - Documentation of data sources and rationale per data cell to support transparency and reuse.
  - Foundations for evaluating biophysical, economic, and social implications of implementing these measures.
