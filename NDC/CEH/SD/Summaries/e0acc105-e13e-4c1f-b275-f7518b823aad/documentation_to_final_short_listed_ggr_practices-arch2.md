# Documentation of shortlist of soil-based greenhouse gas removal practices selected following consideration of biophysical, economic and social impacts

## Purpose and scope
- Documents a short-listed set of soil-based greenhouse gas removal (GGR) practices chosen after multidisciplinary assessment of biophysical, economic, and social impacts.
- Focuses on soil carbon sequestration (SCS) in agricultural land and aims to support monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Data Structure and Variables

- Data structure includes tables detailing:
  - Crop, region, climate implications, crop rotation, case study country, and harvested area (ha).
  - Implications of importance for each case for shortlisted soil-based GGR practices.
- Table 1 (Key for data) defines scoring for importance: 1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low; n/a = Not applicable; ? = Further suggestions needed. Justifications for priority are provided in cell-specific comments.
- Table 2 (Header in file with a short description) documents fields and descriptions, including:
  - ID, crop type, region or country, representative crop, rotation, case study country, area harvested (ha).
  - Measures and related comments: erosion control; fire management; stocking density; pasture renovation; sward management; and a suite of extend-perennial-phase measures.
  - Extend_perennial_phase measures include: Reduce_bare_fallow, Cover_crops, Deep_rooted_plants, Nutrient_management, Organic_amendment_inc_grass_to_crops, Residue_management, Add_biochar, pH_management, Reduced_no_till, Water_management, Wetland_management, Agroforestry, Hedges, with corresponding comment data sources for each.

## Measures and data fields (example of included practices)
- Erosion control; Fire management; Stocking density; Pasture renovation; Sward management.
- Extend_perennial_phase measures (and sub-measures): Reduce_bare_fallow; Cover_crops; Deep_rooted_plants; Nutrient_management; Organic_amendment_inc_grass_to_crops; Residue_management; Add_biochar; pH_management; Reduced_no_till; Water_management; Wetland_management; Agroforestry; Hedges.
- Each measure includes a specific data source or comment field to document provenance and data quality.

## Methodology

- Context: GGRTs (greenhouse gas removal technologies) include soil carbon sequestration (SCS) in agricultural land.
- Objective: Address environmental heterogeneity and practice differences that challenge practical SCS implementation.
- Shortlist development: Multidisciplinary analysis of practices already proposed to deliver SCS; informed by literature and expert input.
- Assessment criteria:
  - Identify practices with potential positive farm-level SCS impact and uptake compatible with global impact.
  - Focus areas include: optimizing crop productivity (e.g., nutrients, pH, irrigation), reducing soil disturbance and improving soil physical properties (e.g., rotations, minimum till), minimizing carbon losses and erosion, adding carbon from outside the system (e.g., organic amendments, biochar), and providing additional within-system carbon inputs (e.g., agroforestry, cover crops).
  - Consider economic and non-cost barriers, incentives, and externalities of implementation.
  - Evaluate whether current scientific methods can quantify technical potential and externalities, and the barriers/incentives to global adoption.
- Process: Shortlist derived from a broad literature review and expert panel input.

## Outputs and monitoring implications

- Provides a standardized dataset to compare biophysical, economic, and social impacts of soil-based GGR practices.
- Supports monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Aids in assessing potential farm-level benefits and broader policy relevance of SCS measures.

## Data quality, access, and transparency

- Data are drawn from established sources and undergo verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to ensure accessibility.
- Emphasizes enabling access to underlying data to promote transparency and reuse by others.
