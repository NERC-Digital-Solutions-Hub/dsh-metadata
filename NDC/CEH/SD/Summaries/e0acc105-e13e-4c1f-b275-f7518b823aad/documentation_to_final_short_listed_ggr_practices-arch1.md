# Documentation of shortlist of soil-based greenhouse gas removal practices selected following consideration of biophysical, economic and social impacts

## Overview
- Presents a short list of soil-based greenhouse gas removal practices (GGRTs) aimed at enhancing soil carbon sequestration (SCS) in agricultural land.
- Addresses environmental heterogeneity and differences in agricultural practices that affect practical implementation.
- Shortlist derived from multidisciplinary analysis of existing practices proposed to deliver SCS, informed by literature review and expert panel.

## Data structure and variables
- The dataset table captures for each case:
  - Crop, region/country, rotation, and specific crop type (Representative_of?, Rotated_with?, Case_study_country).
  - Area harvested (ha).
  - A broad set of management measures across erosion, fire, grazing, pasture, sward, and perennial-phase extensions, each with a dedicated data field and a comment/data-source field.
- Data columns include:
  - Erosion_control, Fire_management, Stocking_density, Pasture_renovation, Sward_management.
  - Extend_perennial_phase and related measures: Reduce_bare_fallow, Cover_crops, Deep_rooted_plants, Nutrient_management, Organic_amendment_inc_grass_to_crops, Residue_management, Add_biochar, pH_management, Reduced_no_till, Water_management, Wetland_management, Agroforestry, Hedges.
- For each measure there is a corresponding comment and data source entry.
- Data key (Table 1) uses an importance scale:
  - 1 = High importance, 2 = Medium importance, 3 = Low importance.
  - n/a = Not applicable, ? = Further suggestions needed.
- Jots that the justification for priority choices is recorded in the cell comments.
- The header description (Table 2) defines each field’s meaning (e.g., Area_harvested_ha, Case_study_country, etc.).

## Measures included (representative list)
- Erosion_control, Fire_management, Stocking_density, Pasture_renovation, Sward_management.
- Extend_perennial_phase-related measures: Reduce_bare_fallow, Cover_crops, Deep_rooted_plants, Nutrient_management, Organic_amendment_inc_grass_to_crops, Residue_management, Add_biochar, pH_management, Reduced_no_till, Water_management, Wetland_management, Agroforestry, Hedges.
- Each measure has associated notes and data sources within the comments field.

## Method and data
- GGRTs include soil carbon sequestration (SCS) as a key mechanism to mitigate greenhouse gases in agricultural land.
- The short list results from:
  - Identifying practices with potential positive farm-level SCS impact and uptake compatible with global impact.
  - Evaluating mechanisms such as: optimizing crop productivity (nutrient management, pH, irrigation), reducing soil disturbance and improving soil physical properties (rotations, minimum till), minimizing carbon losses via erosion, adding external carbon inputs (organic amendments, biochar), and increasing within-system C inputs (agroforestry, cover crops).
  - Considering economic and non-cost barriers and externalities.
  - Assessing whether existing scientific approaches can quantify potential and externalities and identify implementation barriers/incentives in global agricultural systems.
- Final shortlist developed through a broader literature review and expert panel input.

## Focus and aims (analytic perspective)
- Aligns with the aim to identify data-supported practices that:
  - Improve the potential for SCS at farm level.
  - Have uptake potential that scales toward meaningful global impact.
  - Allow evaluation of biophysical, economic, and social implications.

## Practical implications for analysts
- The dataset structure enables cross-case comparisons of crop, region, management practices, and harvested area to identify patterns in GGR potential and uptake drivers.
- Can support modeling of biophysical potential, economic feasibility, and social considerations across scales, while highlighting data gaps and accessibility issues (e.g., dispersed sources, regional differences).
- Useful for prioritizing measures and informing policy or program design aimed at promoting effective soil-based GGR practices.
