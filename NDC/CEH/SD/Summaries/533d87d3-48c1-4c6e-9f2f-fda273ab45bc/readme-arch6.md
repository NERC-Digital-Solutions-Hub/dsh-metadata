# This document describes the wind and strain data collected for 21 trees in Wytham Woods [1], a mature temperate woodland in southern England (51°46'27.2"N 1°20'20.1"W), from September 2015 to June 2016.

- Purpose
  - Extract resonant frequencies of trees
  - Estimate critical wind speeds at which trees would break
  - Test a finite element model of tree-wind dynamics
- Metadata and linkage
  - Census IDs available to link trees to the Wytham Woods census (tree_species_censusID.txt)
- Data collection overview
  - Strain data collected at 4 Hz
  - Two strain gauges per tree, attached at 1.3 m on the trunk and approximately perpendicular
  - Six data loggers used; data availability is non-uniform due to battery/storage limits
  - Each logger file is separate and named by the trees it contains (e.g., T1, T2_3, T4_7)
- Data format and calibration
  - First column: UTC datestamp
  - Subsequent columns: strain measurements
  - Two columns per tree (one per gauge), projected into Northward and Eastward directions
  - Data converted from millivolts to strain using calibration information in calibration.txt
- Data processing and reproducibility
  - MATLAB-based processing scripts and smaller MATLAB data files available
  - Processing descriptions, assumptions, and sensitivities documented in the code repository
  - Repository: github.com/TobyDJackson/WindAndTrees_Wytham
- Wind data and environmental context
  - Wind measurements from the canopy walkway
  - Winter: cup anemometer (Vector Instruments A100LK/5M)
  - Summer: Gill Sonic-1
  - Time resolution varies by instrument
  - Local climate data and long-term wind data available from the Environmental Change Institute (data.ecn.ac.uk)
- Access and contact
  - Data and scripts available via GitHub
  - Email for questions: tobydjackson@gmail.com
