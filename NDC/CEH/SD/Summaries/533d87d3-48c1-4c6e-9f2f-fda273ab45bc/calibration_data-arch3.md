## Aim
- To identify environmental health measures for scrutinising and evaluating policy, and informing future decisions.

## Who they are
- Managers within government departments or environmental quangos responsible for deciding on and implementing monitoring approaches.

## How they meet their aims
- Engage stakeholders and experts to identify measures that provide useful insight and learn from others to avoid duplication.
- Locate and verify available data; address metadata gaps by contacting dataset originators; may need to add metadata and publicly share data, which can be a barrier.
- Commission new data to fill gaps; ensure quality, openness, and data management standards are set at the source.
- Ensure data is quality assured, cleaned, transformed, analyzed, and findings presented clearly via reports, charts, or dashboards.
- Disseminate outputs, consult stakeholders, ensure underlying data is shared appropriately, and implement data governance processes.

## Particular Challenges
- Lack of data or data of insufficient quality.
- Lack of access to data, including timely access.
- Silos within and between organisations hindering data sharing.
- Requirement to publicly share datasets can be a barrier.
- Keeping data up to date as a barrier to sharing.
- Inadequate metadata hindering assessment of suitability.
- Data formats requiring effortful transformation to be usable.
- Communicating complex findings clearly.
- Establishing data governance to ensure standards, storage, sharing, and ongoing updates.

## Additional content
- The document includes a data-like block of numeric entries (bearing, calibration, length), illustrating raw data scenarios and the kinds of data handling and metadata considerations relevant to monitoring frameworks.
