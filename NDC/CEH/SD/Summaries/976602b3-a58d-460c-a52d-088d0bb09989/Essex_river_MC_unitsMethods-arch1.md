# Overall sampling design

- Objective: Address hypotheses on how the functional microbial community involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling changes seasonally and with geology.
- Overall design: All measurements are paired within a single column. At each site, 5 sediment cores (internal diameter 8 cm) are collected within a 25 m river reach; from each core, 4 sub-cores (internal diameter 2 cm) are taken to pair measurements. Sub-cores are stored according to the analyses performed.
- Data focus: Captures variations in microbial communities, genes, organic and inorganic carbon, methane cycling, and related chemical parameters across sites with different underlying geology.

## Identifying information and site metadata

- Date and site: date of measurement; date defined as Month-Year; site.name (short site name; first letter indicates geology: C=chalk, A=clay, G=greensand; second letter is river initial; a numeric code for each river: CE1, GA2, GN1, CW2, AS1, AS2).
- Geography: latitude and longitude for each site; precise coordinates provided for all listed sites.
- Geology: sub-catchment underlying geology type (Clay, Chalk, Greensand).

## Practical considerations for analysts

- The study design supports exploring seasonal and geological effects on microbial genes linked to carbon and nitrogen cycling, and their relationship to organic carbon, inorganic carbon, methane potential, and sediment texture.
- Rich metadata (site codes, geology, coordinates, dates) facilitates cross-site comparisons and reproducibility.
- Data are generated using established molecular, chemical, and physical-chemical methods with clear calibration and QA controls (negative controls, internal standards, calibration ranges).
