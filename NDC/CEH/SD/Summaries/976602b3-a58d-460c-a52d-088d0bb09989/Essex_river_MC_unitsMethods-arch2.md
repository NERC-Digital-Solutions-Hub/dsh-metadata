# Overall sampling design

## Overview
- Purpose: investigate how the functional microbial community involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling changes seasonally and with geology.
- Scope: measurements across genes, carbon and carbohydrates, methane processes, particle size, water chemistry, and sediment chemistry within river reaches.

## Sampling design and how data are collected
- At each site, 5 sediment cores (diameter 8 cm) were taken within a 25 m river reach.
- From each core, 4 sub-cores (diameter 2 cm) were taken to pair measurements; sub-cores stored according to analysis type.
- Design aims to generate paired measurements and enable linking of biological, chemical, and physical data.

## Identification and metadata
- date and site.name (encoded: geology + river name + river number; e.g., C/A/G denote chalk, clay, greensand; GA2 indicates River Avon).
- site coordinates provided (latitude/longitude) for each river site.
- geology category: sub-catchment geology type (Clay, Chalk, Greensand).

## Measured variables and units

## Data handling and storage
- Emphasis on quality assurance, standardised methods, and documenting methodological details (primers, standards, calibration ranges, incubation conditions).
- Data are prepared for storage and upload to appropriate data portals to enable wider accessibility and reuse.

## Key aims and outputs for policy and monitoring
- Outputs include standardized datasets (genes, chemistry, and physical properties) that can be used to assess environmental health and track policy performance over time.
- Data are designed to be integrated with other datasets to enhance value beyond single-use analyses.

## Particular challenges to address
- Increasing the value of datasets by combining them with other relevant data sources (beyond single-use applications).
- Enabling broad access to underlying data used to create final outputs for transparency and reuse.
