# Header Descriptions for Dataset "OH_Soil_Properties" and "NH4_NO3_OH_Soil Properties"

## Overview
- The document provides the header descriptions (fields and meanings) for two soil-property datasets to support standardized environmental monitoring: OH_Soil_Properties and NH4_NO3_OH_Soil Properties.

## Dataset: OH_Soil_Properties
- Identifier: Sample identification for measurement of each plot/gas chamber ring at each sampling time.
- Site: Site name.
- Sample: Sample number at that site.
- Age: Site age since last wildfire (years).
- Depth: Depth of soil organic horizon (cm).
- BD: Bulk density, soil organic horizon (g cm-3).
- CN: Ratio of total carbon to total nitrogen, soil organic horizon.
- pH: pH, soil organic horizon.
- LOI: Loss on ignition, soil organic horizon (% soil organic matter).
- P: Total phosphorous, soil organic horizon (mg g-1 soil dry weight).
- totPlfa: Total phospholipid fatty acid content, soil organic horizon (nmol g-1 dry weight).
- totFung: Total fungal phospholipid fatty acid content, soil organic horizon (nmol g-1 dry weight).
- totBact: Total bacterial phospholipid fatty acid content, soil organic horizon (nmol g-1 dry weight).
- fungBact: Ratio of fungal to bacterial phospholipid fatty acid content.

## Dataset: NH4_NO3_OH_Soil Properties
- Identifier: Sample identification for measurement of each plot/gas chamber ring at each sampling time.
- Site: Site name.
- Sample: Sample number at that site.
