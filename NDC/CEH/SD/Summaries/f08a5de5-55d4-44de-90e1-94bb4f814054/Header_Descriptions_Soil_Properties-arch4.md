# Header Descriptions for Dataset "OH_Soil_Properties" and "NH4_NO3_OH_Soil Properties"

## Overview
- Provides header descriptions (field names and definitions) for two soil property datasets.
- Defines measurement metadata and key soil chemistry/biological variables to support data discovery, quality assessment, and interoperability.

## Dataset 1: OH_Soil_Properties
- Identifier: Sample identification for measurement of each plot/gas chamber ring at each sampling time.
- Site: Site name.
- Sample: Sample number at that site.
- Age: Site age since last wildfire (years).
- Depth: Depth of soil organic horizon (cm).
- BD: Bulk density, soil organic horizon (g cm-3).
- CN: Ratio of total carbon to total nitrogen, soil organic horizon.
- pH: pH, soil organic horizon.
- LOI: Loss on ignition, soil organic horizon (% soil organic matter).
- P: Total phosphorus, soil organic horizon (mg g -1 soil dry weight).
- totPlfa: Total phospholipid fatty acid content, soil organic horizon (nmol g -1 dry weight).
- totFung: Total fungal phospholipid fatty acid content, soil organic horizon (nmol g -1 dry weight).
- totBact: Total bacterial phospholipid fatty acid content, soil organic horizon (nmol g -1 dry weight).
- fungBact: Ratio of fungal to bacterial phospholipid fatty acid content.

## Dataset 2: NH4_NO3_OH_Soil Properties
- Identifier: Sample identification for measurement of each plot/gas chamber ring at each sampling time.
- Site: Site name.
- Sample: Sample number at that site.
- Age: Site age since last wildfire (years).
- NO3.ppm: NO3- concentration, soil organic horizon (parts per million).
- NH4.ppm: NH4+ concentration, soil organic horizon (parts per million).
- mgNO3.N: NO3- concentration, soil organic horizon (mg kg -1 soil dry weight).
- mgNH4.N: NH4+ concentration, soil organic horizon (mg kg -1 soil dry weight).
