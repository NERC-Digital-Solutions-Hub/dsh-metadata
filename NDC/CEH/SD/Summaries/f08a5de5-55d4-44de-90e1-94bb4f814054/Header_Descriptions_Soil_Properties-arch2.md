## Data quality, standardisation, and monitoring use
- Purpose: Supports consistent data collection and interpretation across sites for environmental monitoring.
- Data handling: Fields are clearly defined with units and descriptors to aid verification, cleaning, and transformation.
- Analytical use: Enables standardised analyses of soil chemistry and microbial/biochemical indicators, as well as integration with inorganic nitrogen measurements.
- Data management: Aligns with best practices for storing and uploading datasets to appropriate data portals; facilitates cross-dataset comparisons and temporal trend analyses.
- Monitoring value: Provides foundational, standardized headers that enhance data reuse, interoperability, and scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
