- Data stewardship implications:
  - Ensure long-term archiving and discoverability of the methods and supplementary data linked to this study, using persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs).
  - Capture and preserve datasets related to museum specimens (e.g., wing measurements) with rich metadata (collection context, dates, specimen identifiers) and clear provenance.
  - Link datasets to the publication and supplementary materials; maintain version history and update pathways.
  - Preserve reproducibility by storing analysis workflows, scripts, and any transformed data used in the study.
  - Document any data sharing constraints (embargoes, licensing, museum data permissions) and establish clear update and access protocols.
  - Provide guidance to data creators on metadata standards, data formats, and accessibility to support reuse and discovery.
