# Methods

- The document points readers to the full methods and analyses in the cited external source: Arce*, Cantwell-Jones* et al. 2022, Signatures of increasing environmental stress in bumblebee wings over the past century: Insights from museum specimens, Journal of Animal Ecology.

- Supplementary material accompanies the paper and contains additional methodological detail.

- The referenced study exemplifies a methodological approach for detecting environmental stress signals in a long-term context by using museum specimens (bumblebee wings) spanning roughly a century.

- For monitoring-framework professionals, this implies:
  - Archival collections can provide valuable historical baselines for environmental health monitoring.
  - Detailed, transparent methods and accessible supplementary material are essential for reproducibility and governance.
  - Data and metadata provenance (origin, quality, and context) are critical, aligning with data-sharing and governance standards.

- The document itself contains no methodological content beyond directing readers to the primary source; to understand or implement the approach, one should consult the cited paper and its supplementary materials.
