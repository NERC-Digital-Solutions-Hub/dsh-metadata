# Data collection methods and description of Lepidoptera data from chalk grassland fragment boundaries within the Stonehenge landscape, UK -1

- Overview
  - Provides raw data sets on the behaviour and distribution of Lepidoptera (butterflies and day-flying moths) at the Stonehenge Landscape in 2011.
  - Adapted from Grace Twiston-Davies’s PhD thesis (Landscape Connectivity: a key to effective habitat restoration in lowland agricultural landscapes; 2014).
  - Includes data quality assurance for outliers and anomalies through exploratory analysis and pivot-table checks (details not shown).

- Study site
  - Location: Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, UK.
  - Landscape: ~500 hectares of former arable land under restoration with species-rich chalk grassland seed mixtures.
  - Habitat: Small chalk grassland fragments on slopes with many characteristic plant and butterfly species.
  - Fragments surveyed (four): Full-moon Bank, Luxenborough Bank, Winterbourne Stoke Group, Fargo Barrow; all within the Stonehenge Landscape estate (National Trust).
  - Survey design context: Boundary surveys across fragment edges adjacent to arable land or grassland restoration, plus control areas within fragments or adjacent land cover.

- Survey design and boundaries
  - At each fragment, 4 boundary survey areas (20 m x 20 m) were established on fragment edges adjoining different land covers.
  - Control surveys placed parallel to each boundary within the fragment or adjacent land cover.
  - Total of fourteen survey boundaries; control surveys used to infer Lepidoptera behavior in continuous habitat.
  - Boundary locations and adjacent land covers recorded (e.g., arable wheat, oil-seed rape, semi-improved pasture, restoration grassland).

- Lepidoptera surveys
  - Schedule: May to July; surveys between 10:00 and 16:00.
  - Protocol: Based on Ries & Debinski (2001), adapted to site constraints.
  - Survey area: 20 m x 20 m around each boundary/control, marked with bamboo poles; grid of 10 m for recording positions and flight paths.
  - Survey method: Observer tracks flight paths from the fragment edge; each Lepidoptera flight path observed for 3 minutes or until criteria for exit from the survey area are met.
  - Replication: Each boundary surveyed for 20 minutes, three times (May, June, July) with equal effort directed at both boundary edge and adjacent habitat side.
  - Exit behavior categories:
    - Crossing: exits the survey area via the boundary between habitats.
    - Following: exits via the edge perpendicular to the boundary.
    - Avoiding: exits via the edge parallel to the boundary.
    - Staying: does not exit the survey area or path too convoluted to classify.
  - Pseudoreplication considerations: No capture/mark-recapture; to mitigate, different species or sexes were recorded for successive flight paths, with ~15 days between replicates per site.
  - Weather: Conditions aligned with acceptable standards used by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (Pollard & Yates 1993).

- Vegetation and nectar data
  - Measurements: For each plot (four 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrats per side of the boundary), recorded:
    - Vegetation height and density (drop-disc method).
    - Percent bare ground.
    - Nectar flower availability: number of flowering units and counts by nectar plant families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Dipsacaceae).
  - Timing: Botanical characteristics surveyed on two occasions between May and August.
  - Nectar emphasis: Plant choices based on a nectar plant database.

- Meteorological data
  - Wind speed and direction recorded for each survey using the nearest meteorological station (Boscombe Down, ~6.5 km SW).
  - Data captured to contextualize Lepidoptera flight behavior.

- Data structure and nomenclature
  - Data sheets and columns (as described in the accompanying tables):
    - Lepidoptera behaviour data (DATE, TEMP, WIND SPEED/DIRECTION, CLOUD, REP, MATRIX TYPE, LOCATION, SURVEY, SIDE, SHELTERED/EXPOSED, START/END TIME, SPECIES, SPECIES CODE, SEX, BEHAVIOUR, HABITAT TYPE START/END, MOVEMENT DIRECTION, NOTES).
    - Resources/nectar data (DATE, LOCATION, REP, SHELTERED/EXPOSED, WEST/EAST/CENTRE, HABITAT TYPE, SIDE OF TRANSECT, QUADRAT NO., DROP DISC, BARE GROUND, DEAD VEG, NOTES; plus flowering plant species data with codes and counts).
  - Data coding: Tables include codes for each Lepidoptera species and flowering plant species (e.g., Ads.sta for Adscita statices; Pie.rap for Pieris rapae; Lux. for Luxenborough Bank; etc.).
  - Nomenclature references:
    - Plants: Stace (2010) New Flora of the British Isles.
    - Lepidoptera: Langmaid et al. (1989), Heath & Emmet (1985).
    - Field identification: Field Studies Council guides (butterflies and day-flying moths).

- Key species and plant resources
  - Lepidoptera species surveyed include common butterflies and moths such as Small Tortoiseshell (Agl.urt), Peacock (Ina.io), Small Copper (Lycaena phlaeas), Large White (Pie.bra), Green-veined White (Pie.nap), Common Blue (Pol.ica), Red Admiral (Van.atl), Cinnabar Moth (Tyria jacobaeae), among others (listed with codes in the data sheets).
  - Flowering plant resources catalogued with scientific names, common names, and abbreviated codes to support nectar availability analysis.

- Data quality and accessibility
  - Quality assurance included checks for outliers and anomalies using species occurrence expectations; details of the analysis pivot tables are not shown.
  - Data organization supports standardised reporting outputs (e.g., maps, charts) for monitoring environmental health and habitat connectivity.
  - Procedures align with an environment-monitoring aim: consistent data collection, verification, cleaning, transformation, and archiving to appropriate portals.

- Implications for monitoring and policy
  - The study provides a replicable framework for monitoring Lepidoptera behaviour and habitat interactions in fragmented chalk grassland landscapes.
  - Data are intended to enable long-term scrutiny of environmental health and habitat restoration efficacy, enabling cross-site comparisons and trend analysis.
  - Emphasis on making underlying data accessible to others to enhance data value and reuse beyond the immediate outputs.
