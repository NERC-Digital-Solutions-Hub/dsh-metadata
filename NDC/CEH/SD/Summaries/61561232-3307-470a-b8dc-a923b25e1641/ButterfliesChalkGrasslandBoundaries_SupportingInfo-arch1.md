# Raw data sets on the behaviour and distribution of Lepidoptera (butterflies and day flying moths) at the Stonehenge Landscape in 2011

- Study site and design
  - Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, UK; over 500 hectares under habitat creation with locally sourced chalk grassland seed mixtures.
  - Study area comprises small fragments of ancient chalk grassland on slopes and groupings of burial mounds; fragments surveyed: Full-moon Bank, Luxenborough Bank, Winterbourne Stoke Group, Fargo Barrow. Owned by the National Trust.
  - Fourteen survey boundaries were set up across the fragments (20 m by 20 m boundary areas). Control surveys were conducted in continuous habitat within the fragments and adjacent land cover. Boundaries and controls were not paired, but controls provided a baseline for Lepidoptera behaviour in continuous habitats.
  - Survey locations and boundary configurations are detailed in accompanying tables (location, side, adjacent land cover, and grid references).

- Lepidoptera surveys
  - Timeframe: May to July; surveys conducted 10:00–16:00 to capture variability across the day.
  - Protocols: based on Ries & Debinski (2001), adapted for the site. Each boundary/control survey area was surveyed for 20 minutes, three times (May, June, July) with equal effort allocated to chalk grassland and adjacent land cover.
  - Flight-path observation: individual Lepidoptera flight paths tracked for up to 3 minutes, stopping if the insect remained stationary >3 minutes or moved beyond 20 m from the boundary edge.
  - Behaviour categorisation: exiting behaviour assigned as crossing (exit via the boundary into adjacent land), following (exit via the edge perpendicular to boundary), or avoiding (exit via the edge parallel to boundary). If no exit or path too complex, category assigned as staying.
  - Measures to avoid pseudoreplication: different species or sexes sampled for successive flight paths; approximate 15 days between replicates at each site.
  - Data scope: no capture/mark-recapture; weather conditions deemed acceptable by UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme standards.

- Vegetation and nectar data
  - Boundary-side plots: eight 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrats per boundary (four on the chalk grassland side, four on the adjacent land cover side).
  - Vegetation metrics: height and density (drop-disc method), bare ground percentage.
  - Nectar resources: number of flowering units, and counts by families Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Dipsacaceae.
  - Botanical surveys: conducted on two occasions between May and August.
  - Weather context: average wind speed and direction recorded from the Boscombe Down meteorological station (6.5 km away), nearest hour.

- Data structure and metadata
  - Datasets and codes: extensive tables documenting data columns and coding (e.g., Lepidoptera behaviour data, resources/nectar data, species lists, and plant species lists).
  - Key data columns (examples): date, temperature, wind speed, wind direction, cloud cover, replicate number, matrix type (grassland restoration, chalk, arable), location, survey type (edge boundary or control), side of location, sheltered/exposed location, start/end times, species, species code, sex, behaviour (avoid, follow, cross, staying), habitat type at start/end, movement direction, notes.
  - Location and boundary metadata: location codes (e.g., WSG, Fargo, Full, Lux), side (West/East/Centre), shelter status (Sh/Ex), grid references (BNG/SU), boundary vs. restoration vs. arable designations.
  - Nomenclature: plant names follow Stace (2010); Lepidoptera names follow Langmaid et al. (1989) and Heath & Emmet (1985); field IDs guided by Field Studies Council guides.

- Plant and Lepidoptera nomenclature and references
  - Lepidoptera and flowering plant species are enumerated with scientific names, common names, and short codes (e.g., Ads.sta for Adscita statices – Forester; Pie.bra for Pieris brassicae – Large White).
  - Nomenclature references: Stace (2010) for plants; Langmaid et al. (1989); Heath & Emmet (1985) for Lepidoptera; field guides for identification; Hardy et al. (2007) and other supporting literature cited in the references.

- Data quality, limitations, and interpretation
  - Data quality assurance included checks for outliers and anomalies via pivot table analyses and exploratory analysis (details not shown in the document).
  - The study avoids capture/mark-recapture to prevent pseudoreplication, but acknowledges potential re-recording of the same individual; mitigated by sampling different species/sex per flight path and spacing replicates by about 15 days.
  - Survey area size is constrained by fragment size; boundary boundaries are 20 m x 20 m with a 10 m grid inside to aid flight-path estimation.
  - Accessibility and data scale challenges common to analysts (e.g., data at local scales, integration of multiple data types, and metadata management) are implicit considerations for exploiting this dataset.
