# Data collection methods and description of Lepidoptera data from chalk grassland fragment boundaries within the Stonehenge landscape, UK

- purpose and scope
  - Provides information on raw datasets for Lepidoptera (butterflies and day-flying moths) behavior and distribution at the Stonehenge Landscape during 2011.
  - Adapted from Grace Twiston-Davies’s PhD thesis (Landscape Connectivity: a key to effective habitat restoration in lowland agricultural landscapes), submitted 2014.
  - Data are raw counts of Lepidoptera individuals and their flight-path behavior; botanical data represent flowering units and percent vegetation cover in quadrats.
  - Includes data quality assurance steps such as checking for outliers and anomalies via exploratory analysis.

- study site and design
  - Location: Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, UK.
  - Landscape features: 500+ hectares of former arable land undergoing habitat creation with chalk grassland seed mixtures.
  - Fragments surveyed: Four chalk grassland fragments (Full-moon Bank, Luxenborough Bank, Winterbourne Stoke Group, Fargo Barrow) within the Stonehenge Landscape estate.
  - Boundary setup: Four 20 m x 20 m boundary survey areas per fragment (edges with adjacent arable land or grassland restoration). Some fragments had fewer boundaries due to size (Fargo Barrow had two). Control surveys conducted in continuous habitat areas parallel to corresponding boundaries.
  - Total boundaries: Four fragments × 14 boundaries = 14 boundary and corresponding control surveys.

- Lepidoptera surveys (behavioral observations)
  - timing: May to July; surveys conducted 10:00–16:00; efforts aimed to sample at different times of day to reduce time-of-day bias.
  - methodology: Within each 20 m x 20 m survey area, observer tracked flight paths from the fragment edge; each Lepidoptera flight path observed for up to 3 minutes.
  - exit behavior categories (based on boundary interaction):
    - crossing: exited the survey area via the boundary into adjacent land cover.
    - following: exited via the edge perpendicular to the boundary.
    - avoiding: exited via the edge parallel to the boundary.
    - staying: did not exit the survey area or flight path was too convoluted.
  - replication and pseudoreplication mitigation:
    - no capture/mark-recapture; to reduce pseudoreplication, each flight path used a different species or sex, with an average of ~15 days between replicates at each site.
  - weather conditions: surveys conducted under conditions deemed acceptable by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme.
  - vegetation and nectar data collection: for each plot, eight 0.5 m × 0.5 m quadrats (four on each side of the boundary) recorded:
    - vegetation height/density (drop-disc method)
    - bare ground percentage
    - nectar flower availability (number of flowering units in selected nectar plant families)

- additional environmental measures
  - wind speed and direction recorded from the nearest meteorological station (Boscombe Down, 6.5 km away) to the nearest hour.

- data structure and key data sheets
  - DATA Lepidoptera Behaviour: columns include DATE, TEMP, WIND SPEED, WIND DIRECTION, Cloud cover, REP, MATRIX TYPE, LOCATION, SURVEY, SURVEY TYPE, SIDE OF LOCATION, SHELTERED/EXPOSED, START TIME, END TIME, SPECIES, SPECIES CODE, SEX, BEHAVIOUR, HABITAT TYPE START/END, MOVEMENT DIRECTION, NOTES.
  - DATA Resources Behaviour: layout for vegetation and nectar resources; transect-level data including LOCATION, REP, SHELTERED/EXPOSED, WEST/EAST/CENTRE, HABITAT TYPE, SIDE OF TRANSECT, QUADRAT NO., DROP DISC, BARE GROUND, DEAD VEG, and nectar/flower resource details with plant species and flowering units.
  - Data dictionaries and column definitions provided to support data interpretation and reuse.

- nomenclature and taxonomic references
  - Plant nomenclature follows Stace (2010); Lepidoptera nomenclature follows Langmaid et al. (1989) and Heath & Emmet (1985); field identification aligned with standard field guides (Butterflies and day-flying moths of Britain).

- Lepidoptera and plant species lists
  - Comprehensive tables mapping Lepidoptera species (scientific name, common name, abbreviated code) including common species such as Adscita statices (Forester), Aglais urticae (Small Tortoiseshell), Pieris brassicae (Large White), Polyommatus icarus (Common Blue), etc.
  - Extensive list of flowering plant species (scientific name, common name, abbreviated code) used for nectar-resource assessment (e.g., Agrimonia eupatoria, Achillea millefolium, Carduus nutans, Centaurea nigra, Prunella vulgaris, Trifolium pratense, Lotus corniculatus, Vicia sativa, etc.).

- data quality, limitations, and considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - Quality assurance performed to identify outliers and anomalies; details not shown.
  - Limitations acknowledged:
    - small survey areas due to fragment size; potential for non-representative sampling if flight paths are atypical.
    - absence of capture/mark-recapture to uniquely identify individuals; mitigated by species/sex rotation and time-between-replicates.
  - Boundary and control comparisons enable assessment of edge effects and habitat connectivity in a fragmented agricultural landscape.
  - Data are designed to support analyses of how vegetation structure, nectar resources, and habitat type influence Lepidoptera movement and boundary-crossing behavior, informing habitat restoration and monitoring policies.
