# Experimental design/Sampling regime

- Objective and scope
  - Investigate phenotype and elemental composition of threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from a marine by freshwater cross.
  - Raised in a freshwater pond for 5+ generations after initial cross.
  - 388 individuals sampled from a pond in Nottinghamshire in autumn 2022; 419 photographs collected.
  - Ethical note: fish euthanised using MS222.

- Collection and generation methods
  - Founders: one male freshwater fish and one female saltwater migratory fish collected in North Uist, Scottish Western Isles (spring 2016) and crossed.
  - Rearing: offspring raised ~2 months in freshwater aquaria at University of Nottingham, then released into a previously fishless pond; natural breeding for ~5 generations (generation time ≈ 1 year).
  - Data and specimens collected Oct–Dec 2022 at University Park campus, University of Nottingham.
  - For each fish: blot-dried, photographed with a Nikon DSLR, weighed to the nearest milligram, measured for body length to the nearest deci-millimetre, heads removed by dissection, sex determined by dissection, body freeze-dried for ICP-MS analysis.

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Phenotype and elemental data stored in QTL_all_phenotype_data.csv.
  - FishID encoding: QTL + year processed ('22) + 3-digit ID (001–999).
  - Dates: dd/mm/yyyy (collection and processing).
  - Measurements:
    - Body length: millimetres to nearest 0.1 mm.
    - Body weight and wet weight without hea
