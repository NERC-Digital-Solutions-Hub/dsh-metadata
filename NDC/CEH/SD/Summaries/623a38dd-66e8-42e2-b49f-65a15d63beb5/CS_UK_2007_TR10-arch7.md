# An Integrated Assessment of Countryside Survey data to investigate Ecosystem Services in Great Britain

- Introduces "appropriate diversity" as a biodiversity-based cultural ecosystem service, explored using Countryside Survey (CS) plant indicator data and UK Priority Habitats concepts.
- Finds declines in appropriate diversity across most Broad Habitats between 1998 and 2007, consistent with overall CS declines and increased plant succession under reduced disturbance or management.
- Attempts to map appropriate diversity using CS data and CSM Indicator species but identifies methodological limitations due to sampling design, bias toward designated sites, and spatial sensitivity when extrapolating from 591 CS sample squares.
- Suggests that high-resolution, location- and history-specific agri-environment management data are needed to make robust, policy-relevant diversity maps.

## Spatial data, units and GIS approaches

- CS data are organized around fixed 1 km x 1 km squares across Great Britain, allowing integration with climate, deposition, hydrology, land use, and other national datasets.
- Analyses focus on changes in nectar plant diversity (pollination service proxy) and broader landscape-context indicators, with caveats about spatial representation and transferability to finer scales.
- Chapter discussions indicate potential for model-based mapping (scenario testing) alongside simpler land-cover basemaps, while emphasising alignment to CS square geometry and consistent coordinate systems.

## Mapping challenges and methodological insights for GIS practitioners

- Visualisation vs. predictive mapping: need to distinguish maps that depict current/possible states from those predicting under scenarios; always communicate uncertainties.
- Data limitations: CS is a countryside-wide, unbiased sample; designated sites are underrepresented in CS squares; extrapolation risks poor spatial sensitivity.
- Drivers and uncertainties: relationships between appropriate diversity and drivers (e.g., climate warming, nitrogen deposition) are not always consistent; data gaps hinder robust attribution.
- Potential outputs: predictive maps of nectar-plant richness by habitat type and scenario-based maps showing potential changes, with explicit caveats on data and lag effects.

## Drivers of change and relations to ecosystem services

- Climate warming since 1980 and reductions in nitrogen deposition emerged as drivers related to appropriate diversity, though results require refined methods and data for robust policy use.
- Nectar plant diversity declines are tied to habitat patches within larger Broad Habitats, with landscape mosaics and management history playing a role; attribution to specific agri-environment measures remains inconclusive due to data gaps.

## Policy context and implications for GIS mapping

- EU Water Framework Directive and Ecosystem Approach frameworks provide justification for integrating biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services into decision-support tools.
- Potential policy applications include informing agri-environment schemes, landscape-scale planning, and cross-sectoral policies that balance biodiversity, water quality, and ecosystem services across scales.
- Pollination services are highlighted as a policy-relevant area; CS offers partial insights via nectar plant diversity but direct pollinator abundance data are not measured.

## Data management and integration insights

- A multi-scale, integrated approach is necessary to relate CS-derived ecosystem-service indicators to explanatory drivers, but high-resolution, coherent data on land management and agri-environment interventions are lacking.
- Interdisciplinary collaboration (natural and social sciences, economics) is required to develop consistent methods for measuring and valuing ecosystem services and to improve policy-relevant analyses.

## Practical GIS takeaways for practitioners

- Use CS-integrated assessment outputs to map ecosystem-service indicators at national scales; supplement with simpler basemaps for context.
- Present predictions with uncertainty, document data provenance, and acknowledge limitations in data and attribution.
- Align analyses to the fixed 1 km CS grid, ensuring consistent extents and coordinate systems across layers.
- Employ scenario analysis to explore how services may change under multi-driver scenarios (e.g., land-use, climate, deposition) and identify high-value intervention areas.
- Consider integrating qualitative landscape assessments (e.g., charismatic landscapes) with CS data to enrich cultural-service mapping.

## Future directions and recommended next steps

- Develop refined measures of “appropriate diversity” that better capture cultural services and are compatible with predictive modelling.
- Improve data availability: high-resolution, regionally consistent agri-environment intervention data; better site histories; data harmonisation across UK countries.
- Expand scenario analyses to incorporate multiple drivers and potential ecological lags; validate models with past change to inform carbon, water, and biodiversity policies.
- Strengthen cross-disciplinary methods for measuring and valuing ecosystem services; enhance regional applicability through additional covariates and targeted data collection.
- Integrate CS outputs with national-level assessments (e.g., UK NEA) and other initiatives (e.g., ALARM) to build a more robust evidence base for decision-making.

## Concluding note for GIS practice

- The Countryside Survey integrated assessment provides a robust GB-scale framework for map-based indicators of ecosystem services by fusing soil, water, vegetation, and landscape data with external drivers. However, the approach faces data gaps, attribution challenges, and scaling limitations, particularly for cultural services. Strengthening data collection, embracing uncertainty, and integrating multi-disciplinary methods will enhance the utility of CS-derived GIS products for policy and management.
