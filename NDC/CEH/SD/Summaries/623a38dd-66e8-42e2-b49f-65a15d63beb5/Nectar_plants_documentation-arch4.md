# Experimental Design/Sampling Regime

- Purpose: Use Countryside Survey 2007 data to model nectar plant diversity as a surrogate for pollinators across Great Britain and predict counts in 1 km squares not part of the CS.
- Study design:
  - 591 1 km squares, stratified random sample by land class (geology, soils, etc.).
  - Within each square, five large plots (x plots) of 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m2) with an inner 2 m x 2 m nest for sampling unenclosed habitats (u plots).
  - Y plots sample remnant semi-natural habitat patches not covered by other plots, often representing historically more widespread habitats.
- Spatial reference:
  - Coordinate System: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).
- Data attributes:
  - plantCount: modeled estimate of the count of all bee nectar plants within a 1 km square.
  - SEM: standard error of the mean (variance of plantCount).
- collection methods:
  - In each plot, compile a list of all vascular plants and a selected range of easily identifiable bryophytes and macro-lichens.
  - Nomenclature follows Stace (1991) and Watson (1981).
  - Cover estimates recorded to the nearest 5% for species with at least 5% cover.
- Analytical methods:
  - Nectar plant diversity used as a surrogate for pollinator distribution.
  - Nectar plant species lists for bumblebees and solitary bees compiled with CEH expertise; counts per plot summed to give a plot-level value.
  - Each plot assigned Broad and Priority Habitat classifications (Jackson 2000; Maskell et al. 2008).
  - Coastal and urban habitats excluded; analysis relies on the Land Cover Map's Broad Habitat categories and does not include linear features (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) that can be nectar sources.
  - To predict nectar plant diversity for non-CS 1 km squares, a Generalised Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) is used:
    - Response: count of nectar plants per plot.
    - Random effect: 1 km CS square to account for non-independence of plots within squares.
    - Distribution: Poisson.
    - Covariates: Broad Habitat, air temperature, nitrogen deposition, precipitation, and altitude.
    - Dominant Broad Habitat in a square used to assign the mean nectar plant count.
- Quality control:
  - Defra/NERC Joint Codes of Practice followed throughout.
- References and supporting documents:
  - Includes key literature on pollinators, habitat classifications, and CS methodologies (e.g., Biesmeijer et al. 2006; Bunce et al. 2007; Carvell et al. 2006; Jackson 2000; Maskell et al. 2008; Smart et al. 2003, 2008, 2010; Stace 1997; Watson 1981).
