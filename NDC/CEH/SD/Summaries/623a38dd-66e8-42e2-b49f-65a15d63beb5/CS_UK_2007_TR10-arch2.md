# An Integrated Assessment of Countryside Survey data to investigate Ecosystem Services in Great Britain

## Overview
- A national, data-driven integration of Countryside Survey (CS) measurements (soils, water, vegetation, landscape) with NEA/MA concepts to monitor ecosystem services over time and examine drivers, interactions, and policy implications.
- Four-phase framework:
  - Translate CS measurements into ecosystem-service indicators aligned with NEA/MA concepts.
  - Quantify current status (2007) and historical change; interpret biophysically in terms of services.
  - Attribution analyses to identify drivers of change.
  - Develop and apply models to explore future scenarios of environmental change.
- Data foundation: fixed-location CS data across Great Britain for 1978, 1990, 1998, 2007; includes soil carbon (0–15 cm), bulk density, vegetation, Broad Habitats, climate, deposition, hydrology, and other ancillary variables.
- Approaches: model-based mapping, direct land-class means, and integrated spatial methods with autocorrelation; use of GAMMs for nectar-plant diversity and other indicators; scenario testing linked to Defra policies.
- Challenges: attributing policy effects due to limited high-resolution management data; data gaps in management interventions (AES) at fine scales.

## Data, indicators and methods
- Data inputs: long-term CS measurements complemented by climate, deposition, land-use, and hydrology data; emphasis on observational data and the difficulty of isolating management effects.
- Indicators and outputs: status and change for multiple ecosystem services; indicators mapped and modeled at GB broad-habitat scales; scenario algorithms to test policy-related changes.
- Modelling: spatially informed GAMMs and other statistical approaches; scenario transfers between habitat classes to estimate potential outcomes under policy scenarios; uncertainty acknowledged in maps and models.
- Outputs for monitoring: predictive maps of nectar-plant diversity by habitat; datasets and model results intended for integration into monitoring portals and policy analysis.

## Nectar-plant diversity: status, drivers and modelling
- Status and trends (1990–2007):
  - Overall declines in nectar-plant diversity across Britain; strongest losses in small, diverse patches within larger Broad Habitats; larger, contiguous Broad Habitats showed smaller changes.
  - Exemplary 2007 hotspots: Calcareous Grassland, Rivers/Streams, Boundary/Linear Features; woodland patches often lower in nectar richness.
- Drivers and patterns:
  - Successional changes, especially increased woody cover on streamsides and later-successional habitats reducing nectar-plant richness.
  - Productivity gradients interact with habitat; some habitats gain nectar plants with reduced productivity, others lose them with succession.
  - Sheep density negatively related to nectar-plant richness in upland habitats, indicating grazing pressure as a local driver.
  - Climate and atmospheric deposition signals weaker at grid-square scale; plot-level drivers more informative.
- Modelling and scenario testing:
  - Key predictors: Broad Habitat, woody cover, climate variables, nitrogen deposition, landscape structure.
  - Defra environment-only scenario (ELS) used to explore nectar-plant diversity responses; bootstrapped transfers estimate distributions at 1 km resolution.
  - Gains from certain habitat transfers (e.g., reducing coniferous woodland, increasing field margins/hedges) possible in some regions, but outcomes depend on habitat context and seed/flowering plant pools.
- Implications for pollination services:
  - Nectar diversity underpins pollination; declines threaten wild pollinators and crop pollination.
  - Management options (AES, habitat restoration, hedgerow management) can support resources, but require finer-scale, spatially explicit data on AES uptake and plant-pollinator links.

## Interactions and cross-service patterns
- Relationships across services show synergies and trade-offs:
  - More habitat area can align with higher plant diversity but lower topsoil carbon in certain contexts.
  - Nectar-plant diversity relates to broader biodiversity indicators and to landscape structure (streams, wetlands, hedgerows).
  - Productivity and soil carbon often inversely related; high productivity associated with lower soil carbon, and vice versa.
  - Freshwater quality, plant diversity, and pollinator indicators show context-dependent relationships varying by habitat and scale (GB vs. country).
- Scale and habitat specificity matter: GB-level patterns can differ within England, Scotland, Wales, and among Broad Habitats; refuges and patches disproportionately sustain services.
- Drivers and attribution:
  - Consistent drivers include climate signals, nitrogen deposition, and legacy effects from past land use; sheep density signals are less consistently attributed to temporal changes due to data gaps on positive AES impacts.
- Policy-relevant insights:
  - Landscape-scale management and service bundling can inform sustainable land-use planning.
  - Trade-offs between services (e.g., food production vs. carbon storage) emerge from spatially explicit analyses.

## Attribution, modelling and scenario testing
- Drivers examined: land-use intensity, arable/pastoral cover, nitrogen/sulphur deposition, climate trends, shading, and landscape metrics.
- Key finding: drivers like climate change and deposition show persistent signals; data gaps on management interventions limit attribution of AES effects.
- Case studies and methodological notes:
  - Niche-model ensemble approaches (e.g., Sphagnum in Blanket Bog) illustrate value and uncertainty in future climate/deposition scenarios.
  - The approach demonstrates the potential of ensemble modelling and scenario testing to explore multiple drivers and lag effects.

## Policy implications and monitoring
- Integrated CS framework supports monitoring ecosystem services and informs policy contexts (NEA/LWEC, biodiversity protection, climate, water quality, landscape planning).
- Data gaps constrain attribution of policy effectiveness, particularly positive AES impacts; finer-scale, polygon-level AES data and improved management datasets are a priority.
- Policy design implications:
  - Supports a shift toward landscape-scale management and multi-service planning.
  - Requires consideration of trade-offs and synergies in decision-making for sustainable land use.

## Cultural services and landscape perception
- Chapter 6 maps cultural services ("charismatic landscapes") by linking CS land classes with qualitative landscape-perception data.
- Landscape complexity and heterogeneity are explored as proxies for cultural services; wide distribution but scale- and data-sensitive.
- Mapping exercises illustrate potential for integrating social science data with CS indicators to improve cultural-service assessments.

## Data collection and management
- High-resolution explanatory data on land management and AES are needed to strengthen attribution analyses.
- Data compatibility across UK countries is essential; a strategic approach to data collection and cross-sector access is required.
- Better integration of natural and social science data is needed for robust measurement and valuation of ecosystem services.

## Interdisciplinary research and communication
- Calls for common approaches across disciplines (natural and social sciences; economics and policy) to data analysis, modelling, and interpretation.
- Emphasis on iterative collaboration with policymakers to produce decision-support tools usable at farm to national scales.
- Need to close gaps between researchers and policymakers to translate ecosystem-service research into robust policy guidance.

## Conclusions
- Integrated assessment with CS data is feasible and valuable for linking long-term monitoring to ecosystem-service concepts and policy planning.
- Clear regional and service-specific patterns emerge, including:
  - Declines in nectar resources and plant diversity in many contexts.
  - Relative stability of some soil-carbon indicators with habitat nuance.
  - Data gaps for attributing policy effects and AES impacts.
- Recommendations:
  - Obtain finer-scale, spatially explicit management data (AES, hedgerow restoration, set-aside).
  - Improve drivers data linking land use and deposition changes to service outcomes.
  - Develop ensemble modelling and scenario testing for multiple drivers with explicit lag considerations.
  - Integrate qualitative cultural-service data with CS indicators to enhance mapping.
- The work supports the broader shift to an ecosystem-approach in policy, emphasizing cross-service interactions, trade-offs, and landscape-scale planning.

## Future work and resources
- Further development of policy-relevant outputs, including model-based maps of ecosystem-service indicators across Britain using updated land-cover data.
- Deeper integration of cultural services with ecological indicators; expansion of social-science data for landscape appreciation and perception.
- Continued refinement of data collection, including high-resolution AES histories, and cross-country data standardization to strengthen attribution and decision-support tools.
- Collaboration with economists and planners to develop robust valuation and decision-support frameworks for sustainable land use.
