# An Integrated Assessment of Countryside Survey data to investigate Ecosystem Services in Great Britain

## Overview
- GB-scale, longitudinal data fusion linking Countryside Survey (CS) measurements across soil, water, vegetation, and landscape to ecosystem-service indicators defined by NEA/MEA.
- Purpose: quantify status and change in ecosystem services, explore drivers, and demonstrate integrated assessment approaches for scenario testing.
- Outputs include an integrated assessment database, indicators, scenario analyses, and documentation to support policy and research.

## Nectar plant diversity (Chapter 5) - key findings
- Introduction of “appropriate diversity” as a biodiversity metric framed as a cultural ecosystem service.
- Analysed CS plant abundance data for indicator species used in UK Priority Habitats (CSM Guidance). Found declines in appropriate diversity across all Broad Habitats except Arable and Horticulture between 1998 and 2007, aligning with overall declines in CS plant diversity.
- Declines accompanying a pattern of succession toward more competitive species, associated with wetter/shadier conditions and reduced disturbance/management.
- Mapping appropriate diversity using CSM Indicator species faced methodological limitations:
  - CSM species are often linked to designated sites and may be under-represented in CS’s unbiased-square sampling.
  - Extrapolating from 591 CS squares while maintaining spatial sensitivity is problematic due to geographic variation in species presence/abundance.
  - Absolute or averaged CSM indicators would be inappropriate for maps.
- Relationships with drivers were inconsistent; drivers that aligned with expectations included climate warming since 1980 and reduced nitrogen deposition. More refined methods and higher-resolution data on agri-environment management were needed to better inform biodiversity/policy decisions.
- Future work highlighted the need for high-resolution data on management interventions and their positive environmental effects to balance data on degraded conditions.

## Policy context and landscape-scale insights
- EU Water Framework Directive supports integrated management of freshwater ecosystems; ecosystem services valuation could inform decision-support tools that relate water quality to biodiversity and landscape interactions.
- Integrated assessment demonstrated that land use and habitat structure influence freshwater invertebrate diversity (used as a proxy for water quality). Found trade-offs where streamside woody cover benefited some biotic groups but could shade nectar plants and appropriate diversity, highlighting scale- and context-dependent effects.
- Scale considerations: importance of multi-scale analyses to detect local vs. regional effects; data can reveal spatial gradients between intensive land use and biological quality indicators.

## Data collection, management, and limitations (Data Stewards perspective)
- Data gaps and limitations identified include:
  - Lack of coordinated, spatially coherent data on land management impacts (e.g., agri-environment scheme history) across the UK, hindering attribution analyses.
  - Inconsistencies in data depth across years and habitats; potential biases in soil carbon and other variables.
  - Spatial scale mismatches between CS data and certain external covariates; uncertainty in maps due to model assumptions, especially for small or fragmented habitats.
  - Difficulties comparing CS indicators with designated-site-centric measures (Site Condition Monitoring) due to differing methodologies.
- Governance and provenance considerations:
  - CS integrated database is a living resource; requires robust metadata, versioning, and licensing.
  - Documentation needed for data sources, transformations, modelling choices, and translation lookups mapping CS variables to ecosystem-service indicators.
  - Clear data dictionaries, standardized variable naming, units, and scales to enable interoperability across datasets and across UK nations.
- Data stewardship actions recommended:
  - Build a central catalog for the integrated dataset with comprehensive metadata (sampling protocols, QA/QC, spatial-temporal resolution, coverage, caveats).
  - Maintain code and modelling workflows with version control; document translation lookups and modelling decisions for reproducibility.
  - Harmonize data formats and interoperability standards; plan for ongoing integration of future CS surveys and new covariates.
  - Develop balanced access policies with licensing that supports open data while respecting sensitivities (e.g., some agri-environment data).
  - Provide ready-to-use indicator datasets and model outputs with uncertainty estimates; guidance on maps and limitations for policy use.

## Data and methodological implications for stewardship
- The integrated CS approach offers potential for informing policy at multiple scales (farm to national) but requires:
  - Transparent attribution of change to drivers with documented uncertainties.
  - Integration with economics and social science perspectives to support decision-making.
  - Ongoing enrichment with higher-resolution management data and cross-country datasets to reduce biases and improve comparability.

## Future work
- Develop refined, scale-appropriate models to map appropriate diversity and other ecosystem-service indicators; expand data on agri-environment schemes and management histories.
- Integrate CS outputs with UK NEA and other initiatives (e.g., ALARM) to strengthen evidence bases for biodiversity and ecosystem services.
- Explore landscape-scale strategies (habitat mosaics, patches, and linear features) that support nectar plant diversity and pollination services.
- Enhance cross-disciplinary collaboration to standardize methodologies for measuring, valuing, and modelling ecosystem services.

## Concluding notes for Data Stewards
- The Countryside Survey integrated assessment demonstrates a pioneering GB-scale, longitudinal fusion linking biophysical data to ecosystem-service indicators, with clear policy relevance.
- Attributions remain challenging due to data gaps and methodological limitations; governance, transparent metadata, and robust data pipelines are essential.
- Maintain this dataset as a living resource with clear documentation, reproducible workflows, and guidance on interpretation to support policy and research.
