# An Integrated Assessment of Countryside Survey data to investigate Ecosystem Services in Great Britain

## Executive summary
- Introduces “appropriate diversity” as biodiversity framed as a cultural ecosystem service, using Countryside Survey (CS) data to explore its spatial variation.
- Preliminary quantification via CS Indicator species shows declines in appropriate diversity across Broad Habitats (except Arable and Horticulture) between 1998 and 2007, consistent with broader declines in plant species diversity.
- Indications that reduced disturbance/management and successional processes (favoring wetter/shadier conditions) contribute to diversity losses.
- Mapping appropriate diversity is limited by methodological issues: CS is an unbiased countryside sample, while many CSM Indicator species are linked to designated sites; extrapolation to 1 km squares risks loss of spatial sensitivity.
- Drivers related to appropriate diversity include climate warming since 1980 and reduced nitrogen deposition; attribution to agri-environment management is currently inconclusive due to data limitations.
- Future work highlights the need for high-resolution management-intervention data and improved modelling to map appropriate diversity and support biodiversity/policy decisions within a broader landscape context.

## Key indicators, data sources and measures
- Appropriate diversity: a cultural ecosystem service reflecting conservation value and landscape-scale biodiversity health, explored via CS plant data and UK Priority Habitat indicators.
- Site Condition Monitoring (CSM) indicator species: examined for potential mapping of appropriate diversity, with cautions about spatial representativeness.
- Drivers considered: climate warming, nitrogen deposition, habitat type, woody cover, landscape features, and management history; recognition that data on management interventions (e.g., agri-environment schemes) are sparse.

## Findings and patterns
- Across CS Broad Habitats (except Arable and Horticulture), appropriate diversity declined from 1998 to 2007; plant diversity trends in CS broadly show a similar decline.
- Successional dynamics and reduced disturbance linked to declines in appropriate diversity; productivity and shade from woody growth can reduce diversity in some contexts, with some exceptions for boundary/linear features.
- Landscape mosaics (small, species-rich patches and linear features) appear important for sustaining nectar plant diversity and associated pollination potential, suggesting landscape-scale management considerations.
- Mapping attempts revealed methodological limitations: CS’s unbiased countryside sampling clashes with the tendency of CSM Indicator species to be concentrated in designated areas, complicating extrapolation to larger grid cells.
- Drivers like climate warming and reduced nitrogen deposition show expected relationships with appropriate diversity, while other drivers remain less clearly linked, indicating a need for better-resolution data on management practices to disentangle effects.

## Methodological approach and monitoring framework implications
- Integrating CS data with broader biodiversity measures requires harmonized, high-resolution data on land management actions and their spatial/temporal footprints.
- Attribution is largely correlative; improved attribution demands richer management-dataset coverage (location, history, and intensity of agri-environment interventions).
- Comparability between CSM indicators (designated-site focus) and wider CS indicators needs careful methodological alignment.
- Long-term, integrated datasets and ensemble modelling are essential to capture scale-dependent processes, lag effects, and resilience of ecosystem-service bundles under future scenarios.
- Emphasis on developing decision-support tools that link ecosystem-service measures with biodiversity outcomes, water quality, carbon storage, and cultural landscape values.

## Data gaps, challenges, and attribution
- Need for high-resolution, spatially coherent data on land management impacts, including agri-environment scheme participation and practices.
- Metadata gaps and data-sharing barriers hinder transparency and reuse; public sharing is desirable but must balance sensitivities.
- Inconsistent data across UK countries complicates cross-border analyses and policy-relevant benchmarking.
- Distinctions between designated-site measures (CSM) and national-wide “wider countryside” indicators require careful integration strategies.

## Policy context and implications
- EU Water Framework Directive and the Ecosystem Approach: CS outputs can inform water resource management by linking biodiversity, ecosystem services, and water quality within integrated decision-support tools.
- Climate and carbon policy: exploration of soil carbon storage as an ecosystem service; need for improved data to inform carbon-management decisions, including potential soil-carbon sequestration roles in meeting emissions targets.
- Pollination and agricultural policy: CS-related analyses of nectar plant diversity hint at landscape-scale management needs for pollination services; policy relevance to agri-environment schemes and pollinator health initiatives.
- Landscape policy and cultural services: European Landscape Convention informs approaches to measuring and valuing cultural landscape services; potential to map charismatic landscapes and ecological landscape complexity to support planning.
- Rural policy and CAP reform: evidence supports integrated approaches that consider biodiversity, climate resilience, and ecosystem services alongside agricultural production.
- Cross-disciplinary integration: call for collaboration among natural, social, and economic sciences to develop common methods for measuring, valuing, and applying ecosystem services in policy contexts.

## Future work and recommendations
- Develop models to map appropriate diversity across the wider countryside, integrating CS and CSM indicators while addressing spatial biases.
- Improve data on management actions (ELS uptake, agri-environment schemes) and harmonize datasets across UK nations to strengthen attribution and policy relevance.
- Expand CS-based ecosystem-service analyses to cover multiple services (biodiversity, water quality, carbon storage, cultural services) and their interactions across scales.
- Create decision-support tools that account for spatial heterogeneity, scale-dependence, and potential time lags in ecosystem-service responses to policy interventions.
- Foster interdisciplinary collaboration (ecology, economics, social sciences) to standardize approaches to measuring, mapping, and valuing ecosystem services for policy use.

## Conclusions
- The integrated Countryside Survey assessment demonstrates the potential of an ecosystem-service framework to inform policy and land-management decisions at national scales.
- Findings indicate that some services (e.g., certain soil carbon aspects and headwater quality) remain stable or improve, while others (notably appropriate diversity/pollination-related diversity) decline, underscoring the need for landscape-scale, multi-service management.
- The approach offers valuable tools for policy planning and scenario analysis but requires ongoing refinement in data quality, attribution methods, scale-appropriate analyses, and integration with socio-economic dimensions to fully support decision-making.
