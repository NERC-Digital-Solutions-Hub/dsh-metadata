# An Integrated Assessment of Countryside Survey data to investigate Ecosystem Services in Great Britain

- This report uses Countryside Survey data to quantify ecosystem services and biodiversity relationships across Britain, applying an integrated, multi-scale approach to inform policy and land-management decisions.

## Policy and strategic context

- Shifts from species/habitat targets to ecosystem services to support sustainable delivery and ecological integrity.
- Ecosystem services perspective aims to inform cross-cutting policies (biodiversity, climate, water, agriculture, landscape planning) and to understand policy interactions and trade-offs.
- Integrated assessment aligns with EU Water Framework Directive, CAP reforms, and climate policy goals, emphasizing multiple scales and sectoral coordination.

## Data and methods

- Data source: Countryside Survey (CS) with fine-grained, co-located measurements of soils, water, vegetation, and landscape across Great Britain.
- Analytical approach: linking biophysical variables to ecosystem services via the ecosystem service cascade framework; multi-scale analyses (GB-wide and 1 km square scales); scenario testing and bootstrapping to explore policy options and uncertainties.
- Cross-disciplinary aim: combine natural science metrics with policy-relevant interpretation; identify drivers of change and potential management responses.
- Key limitations: data gaps in high-resolution management history (e.g., agri-environment schemes), cross-country data compatibility, and measurement challenges for cultural services.

## Ecosystem services and biodiversity relationships

- Water quality (Provisioning): habitats’ biodiversity and streamside conditions influence water quality; land use, particularly arable management, and nutrient deposition (phosphorus) affect aquatic health.
- Appropriate biodiversity (Cultural): concept of desirable/undesirable species tied to habitat condition; climate change and nitrogen deposition affect habitat-specific appropriate diversity in some contexts; challenges exist in mapping across the wider countryside due to data representation.
- Soil carbon (Regulating/Provisioning/Supporting): soil carbon linked to habitat cover and deposition; long-term carbon storage shows little large-scale change, but declines in topsoil carbon concentration and density observed in arable soils with implications for climate regulation and food production.
- Pollination (Regulating): wild pollinators depend on nectar-providing plants; declines in nectar plant diversity prominent in small habitat patches within larger Broad Habitats; grazing (notably sheep) linked to reduced nectar resources in upland habitats; management mosaics and hedgerows important for sustaining pollination resources.
- Charismatic landscapes (Cultural): landscape value and aesthetics mapped; biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity contribute to cultural service delivery; urban and scale limitations affect perception scores.
- Interactions between services: productivity and diversity act as major gradients; high plant diversity can accompany high soil carbon, but very high productivity with carbon storage can suppress some services; landscape mosaics support multiple services, highlighting trade-offs and synergies that require region- and habitat-specific planning.

## Implications for policy and decision-making

- Supports the Ecosystem Approach: biodiversity underpinning service delivery; need to balance cross-cutting policies with regional/habitat context.
- Scenario and bootstrapping analyses help illuminate potential outcomes of policy options, revealing trade-offs (e.g., shifting habitat composition can alter nectar plant diversity and pollination services).
- Emphasizes importance of habitat mosaics and small high-diversity refuges within broader landscapes to sustain multiple services.
- Points to the need for data-informed decision-support tools and integrated policy design that accounts for spatial and temporal lags, cross-sector interactions, and uneven geographic distribution of service provision.
- Highlights policy-relevant questions for agri-environment schemes, land-use planning, and climate-related land-management targets, while recognizing limits of attributing changes to specific policies due to data gaps.

## Data gaps, limitations, and future work

- Need higher-resolution, coordinated data on land management impacts (e.g., agri-environment scheme histories) to strengthen attribution analyses.
- Cross-UK data compatibility and harmonization are essential for robust national-scale inferences.
- Cultural services require improved, consistent measurement approaches and integration with social science/economics to inform valuation and policy design.
- Future work should validate models with past change, develop decision-support tools across scales (farm to national), and pursue broader integration with economics and policy research.
- Encourages development of common methodologies for measuring and valuing ecosystem services to enable reliable cross-disciplinary interpretation and policymaking.

## Conclusions

- The integrated Countryside Survey assessment advances evidence for linking biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services, while illustrating the complexities and uncertainties inherent in measuring ecosystem services across scales.
- It demonstrates the value of long-term, co-located data for informing policy, highlighting trade-offs, synergies, and the potential for model-based mapping of ecosystem services to support sustainable land management.
- The study advocates stronger cross-disciplinary collaboration (natural and social sciences, economics, policymakers) to develop robust, scalable decision-support frameworks that reflect real-world policy needs and the dynamic nature of ecosystems.
