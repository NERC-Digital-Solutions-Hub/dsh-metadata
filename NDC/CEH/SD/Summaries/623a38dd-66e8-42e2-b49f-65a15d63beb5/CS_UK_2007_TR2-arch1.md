# CS Technical Report No.2/07: Vegetation Plots Handbook

- Aims of the Countryside Survey vegetation plots: record plant species presence and abundance across diverse plot types to enable four-point temporal change analyses over 29 years; emphasizes repeatable relocation and robust data capture.

- Tools and data workflow:
  - Vegplots forms-based software for digital data capture; tablet-based photo logging; ArcMap plot maps for spatial context.
  - Daily data handling includes GPS logging, site header data, plot coordinates, and nested species data; data can be uploaded and made discoverable with metadata.
  - Tablet datasets are labeled (e.g., VegetationPlots.mdb or VegetationPlotsA.mdb) to avoid overwriting when multiple tablets are used.

- Plot relocation and addition (overview):
  - Relocation uses a hierarchy of maps, photos, and GPS aids to re-find plots; if relocation is not satisfactory, a plot is recorded as Not Found and may be replaced.
  - New plots are added for missing or changed sites or new plot types; markers include metal plates or wooden stakes; precise marking and alignment are important for repeatability.
  - Plot numbering rules ensure new plots do not duplicate existing locations within a square (e.g., Y6 if Y plots previously existed).

- Data entry and workflow on tablets:
  - Steps: locate ArcMap point, open VegPlots, select Plot ID, complete header and nest data, validate, save, and exit.
  - The Nest field and Selected Species tabs govern how species are recorded across nested plots; prompts ensure accurate 1% presence and 5% cover category recording.
  - Photos are required to aid relocation; ensure plot number and type are visible on each photo; periodic downloading of photos to tablet storage is required.

- Plot maps and plotting protocols:
  - Plot maps are essential for relocation and data interpretation; maps may be edited or redrawn if landscape has changed.
  - For new or relocated plots, sketches with measurements and bearings are provided; for X plots, five-sector overlay and random positioning guide placement.
  - Guidelines emphasize clarity, reproducibility, and appropriate reference features, with allowances for challenging upland or semi-natural terrains.

- Plot types and layouts (key types and purposes):
  - X PLOTS – LARGE, MAIN OR “WALLY” PLOTS (X1-X5)
    - 200 m2 plots with nested 4 m2 inner nest and a 1 m2 outer nest; provide random sampling of common vegetation types; marking near south corner; may include multiple plots per map.
  - Y PLOTS – SMALL, TARGETED OR HABITAT PLOTS (Y1-Y5)
    - 2 m x 2 m; placed in un-sampled habitat patches or Priority Habitats (PH); nesting allows multiple nested subplots; PH designation recorded in header.
  - U PLOTS – UNENCLOSED PLOTS (U1-U10)
    - 2 m x 2 m; represent unenclosed broad habitats; up to 10 per square; allocated based on proportion of unenclosed habitat; random placement within eligible areas.
  - S PLOTS / W PLOTS – STREAMSIDE PLOTS (S1-2) and W PLOTS (W1-3)
    - 10 m x 1 m; placed along watercourses or waterside features; header includes stream type and water condition; careful placement to reflect typical wateredge interaction.
  - R PLOTS / V PLOTS – ROADSIDE AND VERGE PLOTS (R1-2, V1-3)
    - 10 m x 1 m; located along roadsides and verges; header includes road type; plots avoid overlap and respect road safety.
  - A PLOTS – ARABLE FIELD MARGIN PLOTS (A3, etc.)
    - 100 m x 1 m; located adjacent to arable boundaries; outer 50 m extends into field; central 4x1 m nest records presence and inner nest records site.
  - M PLOTS – MARGIN PLOTS (M4-5)
    - Newly introduced; margins up to about 6 m wide; typically away from cross-compliance hedges; multiple plots placed along margins as appropriate.
  - H PLOTS – HEDGEROW PLOTS (H1-H2)
    - 10 m x 1 m; placed along hedges or woody features; outer 1 m margin extends toward field; baseline hedgerow sampling with adjacent D plots where applicable.
  - D PLOTS – HEDGEROW DIVERSITY PLOTS (D1-D10)
    - 30 m long; assess woody species diversity and hedgerow condition; extensive header fields (modal height, width, gappiness, historic management signals, invasive species presence, etc.); detailed woody species lists.
  - B PLOTS – BOUNDARY PLOTS (B1-B5)
    - Located at field boundaries; record boundary type (hedge, fence, ditch, etc.) and distance from boundary to study center; used to pair with X plots and ensure boundary context.
  - A PLOH PLOTS – HEDGEROW DIVERSITY/ RELATED PLOTS (contextual naming for D-type integration in hedgerows)
  - S/W/R/V combined notes highlight that several linear plot types are colocated or cross-referenced with X plots and require careful placement to avoid overlap and to reflect land-use changes.

- Species recording and data structure:
  - Listed species: comprehensive presence/absence within plots, with nested subplots allowing detailed species assemblages; plants, bryophytes, and lichens included per plot-type-specific rules.
  - Selected Species: dynamic list of species ticked as present with estimated total cover percentages; 1% presence increments up to 5% categories; nested plots contribute to overall cover totals.
  - Aggregations/Combinations: where identification is uncertain, amalgamated taxa are used to preserve consistency with past surveys (examples include Cardamine hirsuta/flexuosa).
  - Bryophytes and lichens: restricted to taxa on the provided list; not a full bryophyte/lichen survey.
  - Sphagna: explicit subcategories for several Sphagnum forms included in the bryophyte section.

- Data quality, validation, and administration:
  - After data entry, use Validate to highlight missing fields; header fields turn red if incomplete; select species missing data are flagged on the Selected Species tab.
  - Regular saving and back-up precautions are recommended; photos and maps are retained in organized directories for traceability.
  - Important to avoid double-counting overlapping canopy materials; treat over-hanging vegetation carefully and maintain consistent counting rules across observers.

- Special considerations and challenges (analyst perspective):
  - Local-scale data gaps and difficult-to-access datasets mirrored in the field: extensive reliance on multiple data sources (maps, photos, GPS, field notes).
  - Variable data quality across plot types and complex nesting (especially X, Y, D plots) requires careful interpretation and documentation.
  - Logistics: IT and hardware constraints (tablet storage, ArcMap integration, data synchronization) and the need for timely data entry to support longitudinal analyses.
  - Protocols emphasize reproducibility, traceability, and standardization to enable robust cross-square comparisons and long-term trend analyses.

- General notes:
  - Plot maps and relocation are critical to longitudinal integrity; precise location and consistent markers (plates/stakes) are emphasized.
  - The handbook provides comprehensive guidance on field protocols, database structure, and QA steps to produce a unified, comparable vegetation dataset for 2007 Countryside Survey.
