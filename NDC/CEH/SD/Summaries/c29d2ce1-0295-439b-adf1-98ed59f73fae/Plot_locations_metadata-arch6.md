# Plot_locations_metadata.rtf

- This metadata describes the Plot_locations.csv file, which contains the locations of sampling sites for a hillslope study near the river Hiraethlyn.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Three 75 m long transects, 20 m apart, across a hillslope and running perpendicular to the river Hiraethlyn.
- Each transect includes four boreholes drilled to bedrock; some locations have a second borehole labeled 'new' that does not differ from the 'old' boreholes.

## Collection methods and instrumentation
- Coordinates were collected using a handheld Garmin GPS device.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Latitude and longitude recorded in degrees, minutes, and seconds and converted to decimal degrees.
- Coordinates also recorded as six-figure Ordnance Survey National Grid references.

## Data structure
- Plot_locations.csv comprises 8 columns:
  - Name: site identifier
  - Latitude: decimal degrees
  - Longitude: decimal degrees
  - Date: date of measurement
  - Time: time of measurement (Greenwich Mean Time)
  - Easting: British National Grid Easting
  - Northing: British National Grid Northing
  - ODN: Elevation in metres above Ordnance Datum Newlyn

## Projections and display notes
- Users must ensure the correct projection is used and the base map is in the correct projection to display sample sites accurately.
- Longitude/Latitude values use GCS_WGS_1984 (WKID: 4326; EPSG).
- Eastings/Northings use OSGB1936 British National Grid (WKID: 27700; EPSG).

## Additional notes
- An accompanying image (courtesy Welsh Government) illustrates the correct locations.
