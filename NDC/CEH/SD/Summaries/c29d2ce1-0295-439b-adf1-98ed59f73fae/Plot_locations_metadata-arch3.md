# Plot_locations_metadata.rtf

- This metadata describes the corresponding Plot_locations.csv, which holds the sampling site locations.
- Sampling design: three transects, each 75 m long and 20 m apart, across a hillslope perpendicular to the river Hiraethlyn; along each transect four boreholes drilled to bedrock, with some locations having a second borehole labeled as 'new' (not functionally different from 'old').
- Collection methods: coordinates measured with a handheld Garmin GPS device.
- Recorded values and units:
  - Latitude and Longitude recorded in decimal degrees after conversion from degrees, minutes, seconds.
  - Also provided as six-figure Ordnance Survey National Grid (OSGB) references.
- Data structure: Plot_locations.csv contains 8 columns:
  - Name (Site identifier)
  - Latitude (decimal degrees)
  - Longitude (decimal degrees)
  - Date (measurement date)
  - Time (Greenwich Mean Time)
  - Easting (British National Grid)
  - Northing (British National Grid)
  - ODN (Elevation in metres above Ordnance Datum Newlyn)
- Projections and display guidance:
  - Longitude/Latitude should be displayed using GCS_WGS_1984 (WKID: 4326, EPSG).
  - Eastings/Northings should use OSGB1936 British National Grid (WKID: 27700, EPSG).
  - Ensure the base map projection matches to display sites correctly.
- Note: An image (courtesy of Welsh Government) illustrates the correct locations.
