# AN Protocol ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY - NITROGEN DIOXIDE Version 1.1 (previously AC Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

- Aim
  - Detect and define changes in periodic mean atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
  - Emphasizes NO2 as the most significant NOx oxide in urban atmospheres due to health and ecosystem effects.
  - Proposes a low-cost, reliable measurement method using passive diffusion tubes; replication needed due to tube variability.

- Context and rationale
  - NOx sources include both natural and man-made origins; urban sources (vehicles, power/industrial plants) concentrated near populations.
  - NO2 is a respiratory irritant and contributes to photochemical smog and acid rain; potential ecosystem impacts via nitrogen input.
  - Consideration to extend monitoring to other pollutants (ammonia, SO2, ozone) is ongoing, but no reliable passive methods currently exist for them.

- Measurement method (overview)
  - Use passive diffusion tubes with NO2-absorbing discs inside tubes.
  - Three experimental and three blank tubes used per site to account for variability.
  - Sampling period is two weeks; deployed tubes are collected, caps re-fitted, and analyzed in the lab.

- Equipment and preparation
  - Components: stainless steel mesh discs (1 cm diameter) with NO2 absorbent, diffusion tubes, colored and clear caps (for exposed and blank tubes).
  - Cleaning and preparation protocols: acid wash, Decon 90 cleaning, drying; proper handling with forceps; fresh preparation of diluted absorbent prior to use.
  - Storage: tubes stored refrigerated; fresh absorbent prepared on use day.

- Field location and deployment
  - Tubes mounted in clips, either on a bulk precipitation collector pole or a post at 1.5 m above ground; siting inside meteorological instrument enclosure if present.
  - Deployment: tubes placed vertically with open ends downward; collected after two weeks.
  - Blank tubes included and transported unused to site; returned to lab the same day as exposed tubes.

- Labelling and traceability
  - Strict coding scheme to ensure data traceability:
    - ECN Measurement Code (AN), Site ID, Location Code, tube code (E1–E3 for exposed; B1–B3 for blanks), sampling date.
  - Unique reference used for data transfer to ECN database.

- Analytical procedure (Appendix I)
  - Absorbent analyzed to yield total NO2 absorption for the sampling period; converts to mean NO2 concentration.
  - Safety: operators must wear gloves; tubes rinsed after analysis to prevent cross-contamination.
  - Reagents and standards prepared fresh daily; colorimetric reading at 542 nm against a water blank.
  - Calculation: relate absorption to NO2 mass (µg) and convert to concentration (ppb) using sampling period and tube geometry.

- Reagents and standards (Appendix I)
  - Sulphanilamide and N-1-naphthylethylene-diamine dihydrochloride (NEDA) reagents with specified preparation and handling.
  - Stock and working standards prepared for NO2 calibration; procedures describe volumes and sequence for analyzing samples and standards.

- Materials and suppliers (Appendix II)
  - Specified components: discs, plastic diffusion tubes, caps; supplier details.

- Data recording and specification
  - Fortnightly recording for each of six tubes (three experimental, three blank).
  - Core dataset parameters include:
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Setting out date/time (GMT)
    - Sampling date/time (GMT)
    - Tube code (E1–E3, B1–B3)
    - Weight NO2 in micrograms (µg)
  - Data transfer formats and dataset specifications are provided by ECNCCU; a standard field recording form is available.

- Data quality and governance notes
  - Replication (three tubes per condition) to account for variability; blank controls for background correction.
  - Emphasizes method reproducibility, standardized labeling, and structured data capture to support integration into ECN databases.
  - References and QA context noted (e.g., quality assurance reviews for urban air monitoring).

- Endnotes and references
  - Acknowledges sources on diffusion tube development, QA standards, and UNEP/WHO reviews relevant to urban air monitoring and data quality.
