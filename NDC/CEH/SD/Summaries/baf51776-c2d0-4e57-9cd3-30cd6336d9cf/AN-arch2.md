# AN Protocol Aim ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY - NITROGEN DIOXIDE Version 1.1 (previously AC Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

- Objective: Detect and define changes in periodic mean atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). NO2 is the pollutant of concern in urban areas due to health and ecosystem impacts; major urban NO2 sources include vehicle exhaust, power generation, heating, and industry. The protocol focuses on NO2 measurement but notes consideration of extending to ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and ozone, though reliable passive methods for these are not currently available.

- Monitoring approach: Use passive diffusion tubes as a low-cost, well-researched method. Three experimental tubes and three blank tubes are employed at each site to capture NO2 over a defined period, with replication to address tube-to-tube variability.

- Location and deployment: 
  - Tubes mounted in clips at about 1.5 m above ground, either on the bulk precipitation collector pole or on a post (within a meteorological enclosure if present).
  - Tubes deployed with open ends pointing downward; placed for a two-week sampling period.
  - Blank tubes are kept unexposed and transported to the site; blanks are returned to the lab the same day as the exposed samples.

- Equipment and preparation: 
  - Diffusion tubes contain stainless steel mesh discs coated with a NO2 absorbent; two dry disks are placed in each cap with 30 µL of 10% triethanolamine solution.
  - Cleaning and assembly procedures precede use, with careful handling to avoid contamination.
  - Ready-made tubes/discs can be purchased; otherwise, components are prepared following specified cleaning and assembly steps.

- Field labelling and sample integrity: 
  - Each tube is uniquely labelled with: ECN Measurement Code (AN), ECN Site ID, Location Code, tube code (E1–E3 for exposed, B1–B3 for blanks), and the sampling date.
  - A unique reference is required for transfer to the ECN database.

- Sampling procedure: 
  - Remove the white cap immediately before deployment; collect after two weeks; re-fit white caps before removal from the post.
  - Three blank tubes are included at each site and processed identically, except they are not exposed.

- Analytical procedure (Appendix I):
  - Absorbent in tubes is analyzed to determine total NO2 absorbed during the sampling period.
  - Colorimetric determination using reagents Y (sulphanilamide + NEDA) and X (standardized to produce a measurable signal).
  - Fresh calibration standards are prepared daily; absorbance is measured at 542 nm against a water blank.
  - NO2 concentration is calculated from the diffusion tube exposure time, tube geometry, and the amount of nitrite collected via a calibration curve.

- Reagents and safety details (Appendix I):
  - Sulphanilamide, N-1-Naphthylethylene-diamine dihydrochloride (NEDA), and Reagents X and Y are required; some reagents are hazardous (e.g., sulphanilamide and NEDA) with storage and handling precautions.
  - Stock and working standards are prepared fresh daily; operator safety equipment (gloves) is required during analysis.

- Materials and equipment (Appendix II):
  - Specified components include stainless steel mesh discs (1 cm diameter), plastic diffusion tubes, coloured and clear caps, and supplier information.

- Data recording conventions and data management:
  - Core measurement: atmospheric chemistry – nitrogen dioxide (AN Protocol).
  - Fortnightly recording for each tube (three experimental and three blanks) includes:
    - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Setting out date/time, Sampling date/time, Tube code, Weight NO2 (µg), with appropriate units and time precision.
  - Required data elements (first four) to identify each sample: Site ID, Core Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
  - Data formats and transfer: datasets to ECN database; a standard field recording form is provided, and additional Data Transfer documentation exists for ECN dataset formats.
  - Note: Experimental tubes are coded E1, E2, E3; blanks are B1, B2, B3.

- Practical notes for analysts:
  - Ensure replication to mitigate tube variability.
  - Store and transport samples under appropriate conditions (refrigeration during the two-week period).
  - Maintain meticulous labeling and data transfer practices to align with ECN formats and portals.
