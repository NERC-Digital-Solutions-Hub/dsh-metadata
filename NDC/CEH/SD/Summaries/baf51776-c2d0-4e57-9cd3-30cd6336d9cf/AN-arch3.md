# AN Protocol ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY - NITROGEN DIOXIDE Version 1.1 (previously AC Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

## Aim
- Detect and define changes in periodic mean atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), focusing on urban sources from motor vehicle emissions, power generation, heating, and industry.
- NO2 is a key pollutant due to health effects and ecological impacts; diffusion tubes are used as a low-cost, passive measurement method.

## Method and Protocol Overview
- Use passive diffusion tubes to measure NO2 over two-week sampling periods.
- Deploy three diffusion tubes per site (experimental) and three blanks; replicate to address inter-tube variation.
- Mount tubes at about 1.5 m above ground; position within a meteorological enclosure if available.
- Possibility of extending the programme to additional pollutants (ammonia, SO2, ozone) is under review; no currently reliable passive methods for those.

## Equipment and Tube Preparation
- Diffusion tubes comprised of stainless steel mesh discs (1 cm diameter) inside plastic tubes with coloured and clear caps.
- Discs prepped: cleaned with acid washes and ultrasonic treatment; handled with forceps.
- Absorbent in caps prepared with 30 µL of a 10% triethanolamine solution.
- Ready-made tubes with discs can be used; otherwise prepare as specified.

## Sampling Locations and Deployment
- Tubes mounted in clips on a post or on the bulk precipitation collector pole; aligned with the open end downward.
- Sampling occurs over a two-week period; tubes collected, caps re-fitted, and transported back for analysis.
- Three blank tubes included and transported to site but not exposed.

## Sample Labelling and Storage
- Unique coding: ECN Measurement Code (AN), ECN Site ID, Location Code, tube code (E1–E3 for exposed, B1–B3 for blanks), and Sampling Date.
- Samples stored refrigerated until analysis; blanks returned promptly for laboratory processing.

## Analytical Procedure
- Absorbent analysis provides total NO2 absorption for the sampling period to derive mean NO2 concentration.
- Reagents prepared fresh on the day of analysis; key reagents include sulphanilamide and N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDA).
- Colorimetric reaction measured by absorbance at 542 nm; concentration calculated from calibration curve.
- NO2 concentration in ppb derived from tube exposure time, tube geometry, and measured nitrite quantity.

## Data Recording and Metadata
- Core measurement: atmospheric chemistry – nitrogen dioxide (AN Protocol).
- Data recorded fortnightly for each of three experimental and three blank tubes.
- Essential recording fields per sample: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Setting Out Date/Time (GMT), Sampling Date/Time, Tube Code, Weight NO2 (µg).
- Standard field recording form available; data formats and transfer documentation govern dataset structure (unique references accompany analytical results).

## Appendices and Materials
- Appendix I: Analytical procedure details, including chemical preparations, safety notes, and step-by-step analysis.
- Appendix II: Equipment details and field recording references (tubes, caps, mesh discs, supplier information).

## Quality Assurance, Data Governance, and Extensibility
- Replication of tubes to ensure data reliability; standardised labeling and measurement conventions to enable data sharing and aggregation.
- Data sharing pathways exist (e.g., ECN database) with explicit coding to ensure traceability.
- While expanding to other gases is under review, the protocol notes that there are currently no reliably passive methods for those additional pollutants.
