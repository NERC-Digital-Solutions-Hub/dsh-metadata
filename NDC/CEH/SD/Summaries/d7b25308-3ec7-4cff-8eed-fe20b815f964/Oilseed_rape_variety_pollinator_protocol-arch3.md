# Supporting documentation for the dataset: Pollinator visitation data on oilseed rape varieties

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to identify key pollinators for oilseed rape (OSR) and assess if there are feeding preferences for individual OSR varieties.
  - Data collected as part of a project addressing pollination ecology in OSR and variety-level interactions.

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Location and timing: data collected in 2012 at four UK national trial sites managed by Syngenta (Fulbourn, Cambridge; Orford, Suffolk; Horncastle, Lincs; Benson, Oxford).
  - Plot structure: each site had 20 OSR varieties replicated in three blocks; varieties are represented by codes due to commercial sensitivity; breeding system indicated for varieties.
  - Sampling within blocks: only two replicate blocks used for pollinator observations; within each block there are 20 variety plots (40 plots per site).
  - Plot size: each individual plot is 12 × 12 m.
  - Flowering threshold for observation: pollinator observations conducted only when ~30% or more of OSR plants are flowering in a 1 × 1 m area.
  - Observation schedule: two visits per site during mid- to late-flowering; observations between 10:00 and 16:00 (start no later than 15:00).
  - Observation protocol: for each plot, a six-minute observation period within a 2 m edge transect; observers could circle the plot as needed.
  - Replication: each variety observed for two separate six-minute periods on each of two sampling days (one per replicate block) to mitigate weather-related variability.

- Data collected per observation
  - Flowering fraction: percentage of OSR plants in flower within a 1 × 1 m area.
  - Pollinator counts by taxonomic group and resolution:
    - Honey bees (Apis mellifera)
    - Bumblebees (multiple species listed)
    - Solitary bees (functional group approach with genera/species groups)
    - Hoverflies (large >12 mm and small <11 mm)
    - Bibionidae (principally Bibio marci)
  - Observations aligned with standard weather limits (Pollard and Yates 1993).

- Quality assurance and data handling
  - Field identification validated by experts (Bees, Ants & Wasps Recording Society member; other observers are bee-identification experts or experienced ecologists).
  - Consistency checks performed by an overall expert; field sheets record the sampler for traceability.
  - Data entry: standardized data entry sheets and a common set of abbreviations to ensure consistent species naming; unique nomenclature to prevent taxonomic duplicates due to revisions; data entry performed by a single person.
  - Data validation: double data-entry checks; graphing of raw values to identify out-of-range values.

- Data structure and accessibility
  - Primary data file: Oilseed_rape_variety_pollinator_data.csv
  - Metadata file: Oilseed_rape_variety_pollinator_data_metadata.csv (describes columns and data content)

- Notes on data context and references
  - Field methodology follows Pollard and Yates (1993) framework for pollinator monitoring.
  - Figure 1 (described in the documentation) illustrates the 12 × 12 m plot with the 2 m observation band.

- Additional context
  - The dataset aims to support understanding of pollinator interactions with OSR varieties and to inform breeding or management decisions that could influence pollination services.
