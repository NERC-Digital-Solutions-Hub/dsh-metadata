# Pollinator visitation data on oilseed rape varieties

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset collected in 2012 to identify key pollinators for oilseed rape (OSR) and assess feeding preferences across OSR varieties.
  - Conducted on UK national trial sites to support environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Sites: Fulbourn (Cambridge), Orford (Suffolk), Horncastle (Lincolnshire), Benson (Oxford).
  - Trial layout: 20 OSR varieties replicated in three blocks per site; plots sized 12 × 12 m; varieties represented by codes (commercially sensitive).
  - Sampling: two of the replicate blocks per site used for pollinator observations; 40 plots per site (20 variety plots per block).
  - Flowering criteria: observations made where ~30% of OSR plants were in flower.
  - Observation window: between 10:00 and 16:00 hours (start not after 15:00).
  - Per-plot observation: six-minute sessions; two sessions per variety per site (across two sampling days), within a 2 m strip from the plot edge.
  - Weather considerations: observations timed to typical bee activity; repeat sessions to mitigate weather-related variation.

- Data collected per plot
  - Flowering: percentage of OSR plants in flower within a 1 × 1 m area.
  - Pollinator counts (taxonomic resolution):
    - Honey bees (Apis mellifera)
    - Bombus spp. (multiple species listed)
    - Solitary bees (grouped by body forms/ genera)
    - Hoverflies (large >12 mm and small <11 mm)
    - Bibionidae (principally Bibio marci)

- Quality assurance and data handling
  - Field identifications overseen by a bee-identification expert; other recorders were experienced ecologists.
  - Consistency checks by a senior expert; recording personnel documented on data sheets.
  - Standardised data entry sheets with uniform abbreviations; single person responsible for data entry.
  - Taxonomic standardisation to avoid duplications; post-entry checks and outlier detection via data visualization.

- Data structure and metadata
  - Primary data file: Oilseed_rape_variety_pollinator_data.csv
  - Metadata file: Oilseed_rape_variety_pollinator_data_metadata.csv
  - Common nomenclature used to ensure consistency; varieties represented by codes due to commercial sensitivity; breeding system indicated for varieties.

- Accessibility and use
  - Data structured to enable cross-site comparisons and integration into standard monitoring outputs (reports, maps, charts).
  - Datasets intended for storage/upload to appropriate data portals; underlying data available for broader analysis.
