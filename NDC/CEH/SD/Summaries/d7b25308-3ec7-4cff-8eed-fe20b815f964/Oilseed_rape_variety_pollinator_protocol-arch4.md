# Supporting documentation for the dataset: Pollinator visitation data on oilseed rape varieties

## Overview
- Purpose: Data collected to identify key pollinators of oilseed rape (OSR) and to assess feeding preferences across OSR varieties.
- Scope: 2012 field observations across four national OSR trial sites in the UK, using coded varieties due to commercial sensitivity.

## Experimental Design and Sampling Regime
- Sites: Fulbourn (Cambridge), Orford (Suffolk), Horncastle (Lincolnshire), Benson (Oxford).
- Trial structure: 20 varieties replicated in three blocks per site; plots are 12 × 12 m.
- Observations: At each site two replicate blocks used for pollinator observations; 40 plots per site (20 varieties × 2 blocks).
- Flowering threshold: Observations conducted only where ~30% or more OSR plants were in flower.
- Observation window: Between 10:00 and 16:00 hours (no transects started after 15:00) to align with bee activity.
- Data collection: Six-minute observation periods per plot along a 2 m edge strip, with plots possibly circled multiple times.
- Sampling days: Each variety observed during two six-minute periods on each of two sampling days per site (one per replicate block).
- Recorded metrics per six-minute period:
  - Percentage of OSR plants in flower (in a 1 × 1 m area).
  - Pollinator abundances categorized as:
    - Honey bees (Apis mellifera)
    - Bumblebees (multiple species listed)
    - Solitary bees (grouped by body forms and selected genera)
    - Hoverflies (divided into large >12 mm and small <11 mm)
    - Bibionidae (primarily Bibio marci)

## Quality Assurance and Data Management
- Field identification: Conducted by/bees expert; consistency checks by an overall expert; recording staff identified on data sheets for traceability.
- Digitisation: Standardised data entry sheets; common abbreviations and nomenclature to ensure consistent taxonomic naming across entries.
- Data checking: Values double-checked after entry; graphical checks used to detect out-of-range values.
- Data lineage: Observers and procedures documented to support error tracing and data integrity.

## Relevance to Data Leaders
- End-to-end data lifecycle demonstrated: robust experimental design, standardized data collection, and rigorous QA processes.
- Emphasis on data standards and metadata to support discoverability, reuse, and cross-site comparability.
- Management of sensitive data (coded varieties) while preserving scientific value and breeding context.
- Clear data structure supports downstream analysis, replication, and collaboration across data networks.
