# Supporting documentation for the dataset: Pollinator visitation data on oilseed rape varieties

## Overview
- Purpose: identify key pollinators for oilseed rape (OSR) and whether pollinators show feeding preferences for particular OSR varieties.
- Date and setting: data collected in 2012 across four national trial sites in the UK (Syngenta sites).
- Scope: pollinator visitation data per OSR variety plots with varieties coded due to commercial sensitivity; breeding system indicated for varieties.
- Plot setup: each site contains 40 plots (20 varieties replicated in blocks; observations focused on two replicate blocks).
- Observation aim: high bee activity window; standardised protocols to enable comparison across sites.

## Experimental Design and Sampling
- Sites: Fulbourn (Cambridge), Orford (Suffolk), Horncastle (Lincs), Benson (Oxford).
- Trial structure: 20 OSR varieties replicated in three blocks per site; two blocks used for pollinator observations (total 40 plots per site).
- Plot size: 12 m × 12 m.
- Observation timing: two visits per site during mid- to late-flowering period; observations conducted between 10:00 and 16:00 (no transect started after 15:00).
- Flowering threshold: observations only recorded where approximately 30% or more of OSR plants were flowering.
- Data per plot: for each six-minute observation, researchers walked a 2 m edge strip and recorded pollinator activity; each variety observed across two six-minute periods per site on two sampling days (one period per replicate block).

## Data Collection Protocol
- Observation duration: six minutes per period; multiple circuits around the plot allowed to cover the 2 m strip.
- Repeats: two six-minute observations per variety per site, on two sampling days (reflecting two replicate blocks).
- Data recorded per plot per site:
  - Percentage of OSR plants in flower (within a 1 m × 1 m area).
  - Pollinator abundances, categorized by taxonomic groups and resolution:
    - Honey bees (Apis mellifera)
    - Bumblebees (multiple Bombus species listed)
    - Solitary bees (grouped by body forms/ genera as applicable)
    - Hoverflies (split into large >12 mm and small <11 mm)
    - Bibionidae (primarily Bibio marci)
- Flowering threshold ensured pollinator data are only captured when flowering conditions are sufficient to attract pollinators.

## Taxonomic Resolution and Observation Details
- Taxonomic detail includes:
  - Honey bees, multiple Bombus species (with explicit species list)
  - Solitary bees grouped by body form/genera
  - Hoverflies subdivided by size categories
  - Bibionidae (Bibio marci)
- Standard weather and sampling limits followed (Pollard and Yates, 1993) to maximise comparability across observations.

## Quality Assurance
- Field identification: led by Bees, Ants & Wasps Recording Society expert; other field recorders were either bee-ID experts or experienced ecologists.
- Consistency checks: an overall expert verified identifications for consistency.
- Traceability: field data sheets recorded the sampler identity to aid error tracing.
- Data entry: standardized data entry sheets and uniform abbreviations; single person transcribed data from field sheets.
- Data validation: entered values double-checked; graphical review used to detect out-of-range values; standardized nomenclature to avoid taxonomic duplicates after revisions.

## Data Structure and Access
- Primary data file: Oilseed_rape_variety_pollinator_data.csv
- Metadata file: Oilseed_rape_variety_pollinator_data_metadata.csv
- Figure reference: Figure 1 illustrates a 12 m plot with a 2 m band where pollinator observations occurred.

## Usage Notes and Limitations
- Varieties are coded due to commercial sensitivity; breeding system information is available.
- Data reflect 2012 sampling at four UK sites and may be influenced by weather and site-specific factors.
- Only plots with sufficient flowering were recorded for pollinator counts.
