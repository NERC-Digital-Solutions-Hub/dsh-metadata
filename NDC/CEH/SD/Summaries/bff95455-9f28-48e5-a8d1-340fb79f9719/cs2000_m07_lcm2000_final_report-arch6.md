# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents a comprehensive mapping between LCM2000 (Land Cover Map 2000) categories and CS2000 field survey classifications.
  - Links Broad Habitats to LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants (with Suclasses shown in map colours).
  - Covers a wide range of habitats across the UK, including coastal, inland, urban, and montane environments.

- Key content highlights
  - Detailed cross-walk for numerous habitats, e.g., inshore sublittoral, standing water/canals, littoral rock/sediment, supra-littoral features, broadleaved and coniferous woodlands, arable lands, improved grasslands, various herb/grass communities, fen/marsh/swamp, bogs, montane habitats, inland rocks, built-up areas, and oceanic/sea categories.
  - Each habitat entry lists corresponding LCM2000 Target Class, Subclass, and Variant (with multiple variants per class).
  - Indicates complex many-to-many mappings across habitat concepts used in planning, policy, and data integration.

- Methodological context (implied by the table)
  - Supports interoperability between two classification systems (LCM2000 and CS2000) through explicit crosswalks.
  - Facilitates data translation for dashboards, reports, and decision-making that rely on consistent habitat definitions.

- Implications for data use
  - Enables users to interpret LCM2000 outputs in terms of CS2000 field classifications and vice versa.
  - Supports alignment of data products across agencies or projects that reference different habitat taxonomies.

- Relevance to Data Support archetype
  - Demonstrates a core activity: understanding the ask and delivering a crosswalk that enables data from diverse classification systems to be combined, compared, and used for self-serve analyses.
  - Highlights the importance of transparent mappings to improve data reuse and stakeholder communication across topics.

- Notable considerations and cautions
  - The mapping involves many-to-many relationships, which can introduce ambiguity if used for strict reclassification without further rules.
  - The accuracy and applicability depend on context, scale, and the specific CS2000 input data being aligned to LCM2000 outputs.
