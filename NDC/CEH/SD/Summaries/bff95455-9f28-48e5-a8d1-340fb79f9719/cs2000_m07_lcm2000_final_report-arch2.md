# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose: map broad habitat types to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants to support standardized environmental monitoring.
- Examples of mappings:
  - Inshore sublittoral: Sea / Estuary (Target class); sea (Variant).
  - Standing water/canals: Water (inland) (Target class); water (inland) (Subclass/Variant).
  - Littoral rock and Supra-littoral habitats: various rock/sediment combinations with defined target classes and variants (e.g., rock Littoral, saltmarsh, dune, scrub, etc.).
  - Arable, horticultural, improved grassland, neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Montane, Inland bare ground, Built up areas, Urban/suburban, and Oceanic/Seas classifications.
- Structure: shows cross-walks between Level 1 broad habitats, LCM2000 Target Class, Subclasses, and Variants, with map display colours for Suclasses.

# Table 5. The coverage (km2) of Subclasses from Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) and of Aggregate classes (bold) from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) in the UK and constituent countries

- Purpose: compare LCM2000-derived Subclass coverage with field survey (FS) estimates across the UK.
- Key content:
  - Large set of habitat groups (e.g., Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable cereals, Arable horticulture, Non-rotational horticulture, Arable & Horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Sem-natural grass and bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Montane habitats, Inland rock, Built up areas and gardens, Supralittoral/Littoral categories, Oceanic seas, etc.).
  - For each region (England, Wales, Scotland, NI, UK): LCM2000 area and FS area (Low/High or FS = . where not available).
  - Totals by country and UK total (LCM2000 vs FS).
- Observations:
  - FS data often unavailable for some classes or countries.
  - Coastal coverage and definitions affect totals.
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS highlight calibration needs and regional variation.

# Table 6. LCM2000 cover (km2) for BHs (uncalibrated) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and GB, compared with field survey estimates at 95% confidence (i.e. +/- 2 standard errors)

- Purpose: present uncalibrated LCM2000 cover versus FS estimates with 95% CIs across broad habitats (BHs) for each UK country and GB.
- Key content:
  - BHs including Broadleaved/mixed/yew woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable and horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Montane habitats, Inland rock, Built up areas and gardens, Supralittoral rock/sediment, Littoral rock/sediment, Littoral rock, Littoral sediment, Oceanic seas, etc.
  - For each BH: LCM2000 total vs FS Low/High (where available) across England, Wales, Scotland, NI, and GB.
- Observations:
  - Uncalibrated LCM2000 often deviates from FS ranges, sometimes outside FS 95% CI.
  - Some habitats show large FS uncertainty (wide Low–High ranges), while others have closer agreement.
  - Coastal and urban-related classes frequently show variability; some classes have missing FS data (n/a).

# Table 8. Summary correspondence matrix (results expressed per 1000) comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain

- Purpose: quantify how often LCM2000 broad habitats correspond to CS2000 field survey classifications.
- Content:
  - Summary correspondences per 1000 for Broad Habitats (yellow), urban-generalised areas (blue), at LCM2000 Target Class (pink) and Aggregate class levels (green).
  - Separate tables for GB-wide and England & Wales; also includes interpretive footnotes.
- Key points:
  - Indicates varying degrees of correspondence, with some habitat types mapping well and others showing misalignment.
  - Urban generalisation and class-definition differences reduce exact matches.
  - Footnotes detail mapping nuances between CS2000 categories and LCM2000 categories (e.g., overlaps, broad vs narrow classifications, and specific pairings).

# Table 9. Summary correspondence matrix (results expressed per 1000) comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares in England and Wales

- Purpose: similar to Table 8 but focused on England & Wales subset.
- Content:
  - Correspondence figures by CS2000 pairings with LCM2000 for various target/subclass combinations.
  - Includes cross-walks (e.g., Coniferous woodland with various CS2000 categories; Arable & horticulture; Improved grassland; Bracken; Dwarf shrub heath; Fen/marsh/swamp; Bog; Montane habitats; Inland rock; Built up areas; Supralittoral/Littoral categories).
  - Footnotes provide explicit mapping rules and potential mismatches.
- Observations:
  - Mapping remains imperfect; substantial portion of CS2000 categories do not map cleanly to LCM2000 equivalents.
  - Some cross-walks show higher correspondences (e.g., certain woodland and arable/horticultural classes), while others show broad misalignment.

# Footnotes and methodological context (key points)

- LCM2000 statistics come from full-count cover on a 25 m grid; FS statistics are from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
- Differences between LCM2000 and FS reflect definitional and methodological variations; coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore inter-tidal areas.
- FS population coverage (1 km squares) differs by jurisdiction (e.g., NI exclusions).
- Tables frequently note data gaps (n/a) and use bootstrapping to estimate confidence intervals.
- The CS2000-to-LCM2000 mapping is approximate; several mappings are non-exclusive or require generalisation (urban, Broad vs Narrow classes).

# Implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment

- Value proposition:
  - Provides a consistent, standardized framework to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Enables cross-country comparisons and temporal trend analysis using a common classification scheme.
- Data workflow:
  - Emphasizes data verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and storage in appropriate portals.
  - Supports integration of LCM2000/CS2000 with field survey data to improve interpretation.
- Challenges highlighted:
  - Increasing the value of datasets by combining them with other relevant data sources (e.g., CS2000) to reduce single-use limitations.
  - Facilitating access to underlying data used to create final outputs to support transparency and reproducibility.
  - Managing uncertainties and calibration needs due to uncalibrated LCM2000 data and imperfect correspondences with CS2000/FS classifications.
- Takeaway for practice:
  - Use standardized habitat mappings to track environmental health over time, but be mindful of calibration gaps and correspondence uncertainties when comparing with field surveys or alternative classifications.
