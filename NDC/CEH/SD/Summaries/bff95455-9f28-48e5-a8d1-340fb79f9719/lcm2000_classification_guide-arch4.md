# LCM2000

- Aims and scope
  - LCM2000 is a thematic satellite-derived mapping framework designed to contribute to UK biodiversity assessment and reporting by classifying Broad Habitats (BHs) and related land-cover types across Great Britain.
  - The mapping aims to distinguish BHs where possible, using spectral data, external context, and subsequent aggregation into Target and Aggregate classes for reporting.
  - The work is linked to the UK Biodiversity Action Plan and uses a cross-wector approach to relate satellite classifications to field-defined habitat types.

- 1. Background and objectives
  - Broad Habitats framework (developed by JNCC) guides the classification of terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal habitats for UK-wide monitoring.
  - LCM2000 maps BHs from 1 km satellite data, with added context from external datasets to refine classifications.
  - The project emphasizes consistency in mapping BHs, while allowing some compromises on accuracy at subclass levels to achieve national consistency.

- 2. Broad Habitats and LCM2000 classes
  - Mapping structure
    - Spectral classes are combined into thematic components, which are further aggregated to build BHs and Target classes.
    - Variants and Subclasses provide finer distinctions where feasible; however, BH definitions and Target classes do not map perfectly one-to-one.
  - Practical limitations
    - Differences in definitions (BH vs Target classes) and the spectral/contextual readability can produce mismatches.
    - Some BHs are difficult to distinguish spectrally (e.g., Neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands; rough vs improved grasslands; bogs vs dwarf-shrub heath).
  - Map display and aggregation
    - Display uses standards aligned with national schemes (LCMGB 1990) with some additions (e.g., semi-natural grassland vs improved grassland).
    - Aggregate classes are used for reporting where BH-level distinctions are unreliable at map scale.

- 2.1 Introduction
  - CS2000 field survey data (569 squares in GB; 549 in 1998, others in 1999) provide a detailed, higher-resolution baseline to assess LCM2000.
  - FS data are not ground truth; a parallel quality-assurance exercise showed about 88% repeatability for primary FS codes.
  - The calibration aims to understand how well LCM2000 corresponds to FS and to enable generation of BH statistics from the broad coverage of LCM2000.

- 2.2 GIS Operation
  - Data handling
    - ARC/Info files created for all 569 FS squares and equivalent LCM2000 map sections.
    - Three main tests: per-pixel, per-segment, per-parcel.
  - Correspondence levels
    - Comparisons span BH level, generalized urban, Target class level, and Aggregate class level.
  - Test types
    - Per-pixel: direct overlay differences between FS and LCM2000 (sensitive to resolution and MMU).
    - Per-segment: LCM2000 segment labels vs FS dominant class.
    - Per-parcel: FS land parcels vs LCM2000 parcel labels.
  - Confidence assessment
    - A bootstrapping method yields 95% confidence limits for correspondence across GB, England/Wales, and Scotland.

- 2.3 Confidence limits for measures of correspondence
  - Overall findings (GB)
    - Per-pixel correspondence: 54% (95% CI 53–56%)
    - Per-segment: 58% (95% CI 57–60%)
    - Per-parcel: 62% (95% CI 60–64%)
  - England & Wales
    - Per-pixel: 60% (CI 58–62%)
    - Per-segment: 64% (CI 62–66%)
    - Per-parcel: 69% (CI 67–72%)
  - Scotland
    - Per-pixel: 44% (CI 40–47%)
    - Per-segment: 47% (CI 43–50%)
    - Per-parcel: 48% (CI 44–52%)
  - Target class level
    - GB: 65% (parcel-based)
    - England/Wales: 73%
    - Scotland: 51%
  - Key drivers of non-correspondence
    - FS’s higher spatial resolution, time differences between FS and LCM2000, class-definition differences, and survey errors.
  - Additional notes
    - The per-pixel measure is most prone to differences due to pixel-level granularity and MMU (minimum mappable unit) mismatches.
    - The FS 1-km squares vs LCM2000 25 m parcels contribute significantly to observed differences.

- 3. LCM2000 assessments at class level
  - Overall trends
    - Broadleaved/mixed woodland and coniferous woodland show substantial BH-level differences in small, scattered patches due to MMU limits and boundary delineation.
    - Coniferous woodland: UK cover ~5.5% (LCM2000) vs 5.8% (FS); direct correspondence around 70%.
    - Broadleaved woodland: LCM2000 ~6.3% vs FS ~6.2%; direct agreement ~44% due to many small woodlands below 0.5 ha MMU in LCM2000.
  - Arable and horticultural land
    - LCM2000 ~23.4% vs FS ~21.5%; about 70% of LCM2000 arable coincides with FS arable; misclassification occurs between arable, horticultural land, and improved grassland.
  - Grasslands
    - Improved grassland: LCM2000 25.7% vs FS 25.8%; good recognizability, but ~20% of FS improved grassland maps as semi-natural in LCM2000.
    - Semi-natural grasslands, neutral/calcareous/acid: difficult to separate; many rough grasses grouped as Neutral grassland by LCM2000; FS often distinguishes Improved grassland via management signals.
  - Peatlands and bogs
    - Bogs (deep peat) show strong sensitivity to peat-depth masks; LCM2000 peat-based bogs are conservative and far smaller than FS estimates; ongoing integration work with other datasets is planned.
  - Heath, dwarf shrubs, fen/marsh/swamp, and montane
    - Notable differences between LCM2000 and FS in dwarf shrub heath vs bogs, montane mapping, and peat-context classification.
  - Inland/scattered and coastal features
    - Inland bare ground: LCM2000 shows more due to urban and artificial contexts; coastal BHs generally small; intertidal areas show disparities due to tidal state and mapping scale.
  - Water and built environments
    - Water bodies (inland) are mapped as standing open water and canals when >0.5 ha; LCM2000 generally aligns with FS for larger water bodies but smaller features differ.
    - Built-up areas and gardens: LCM2000 separates urban development into Suburban/rural development and Continuous urban, whereas FS treats urban land more holistically; this leads to differences in how other land-cover types are mapped within urban zones.
  - Summary implication
    - While LCM2000 captures broad land-cover extents, accuracy varies by class, with highest confidence in some woodland types and arable/grassland distinctions, and lower accuracy in peatlands, rough grasslands, and montane/coastal categories.

- 4. LCM2000 accuracy
  - Important caveats
    - Correspondence with FS is not a direct measure of LCM2000 accuracy; FS is not ground truth.
    - Differences in resolution, data model, and timing contribute to mismatch.
  - Estimated accuracy
    - Segment-level comparisons suggest LCM2000 may achieve around 87% accuracy for Target classes; a cautious realistic figure around 85% is suggested.
    - Per-parcel level accuracy (relative to FS) is lower due to MMU differences (0.5 ha for LCM2000 vs 0.04 ha for FS) and boundary issues.
  - Practical takeaway
    - The overall accuracy reflects a balance between broad coverage and field-validated precision; calibration against FS improves the ability to derive Broad Habitat statistics from LCM2000 data.

- 5. Change detection
  - Changing landscapes require high-precision mapping to distinguish real change from mapping error.
  - Between 1990 and 2000, changes are likely modest; satellite mapping alone cannot guarantee reliable change detection due to resolution and timing issues.
  - The preferred path forward is intelligent, pattern-based analysis that leverages FS baselines and known change directions to identify plausible changes while accounting for classification probabilities and known biases.
  - Planned work
    - Additional calibration against field surveys and integration with external datasets to support robust change detection and improved Broad Habitat statistics.

- Appendix I. A brief review of Broad Habitats with distinguishing features in relation to LCM2000 mapping
  - Broad Habitat overview
    - Summarizes distinguishing features and mapping considerations for BH categories (e.g., broad-leaved/mixed woodlands, coniferous woodlands, arable land, improved vs neutral grasslands, calcareous/acid grasslands, bracken, dwarf shrub heath, fen/marsh/swamp, bogs, water, montane habitats, inland rock, built-up areas, coastal habitats).
  - Key mapping challenges
    - Spectral limitations: many fine distinctions (e.g., semi-natural vs improved grasslands, peat depth influence) are difficult to resolve with 1 km imagery.
    - Context and management signals: distinguishing management practices (grazing, liming, reseeding) is difficult from imagery alone; field knowledge improves classification at subclass levels.
    - Peat and hydrology: peat depth and hydrological context drive bog vs heath distinctions; the peat mask used in LCM2000 tends to produce conservative bog estimates compared with field surveys.
    - Small features and MMU: many woodland patches and semi-natural swards are below LCM2000's minimum mappable unit, leading to misclassifications as grassland or arable.
  - Practical implications for data leaders
    - Expect differences between LCM2000 and field data; use integration with field surveys and ancillary datasets to refine classifications.
    - Be aware of classification uncertainties at BH vs Target vs Aggregate levels, and leverage change-detection approaches that account for known biases.
    - Recognize that coastal/habitat boundaries and urban-rural interfaces present particular mapping challenges at the 1 km scale.
