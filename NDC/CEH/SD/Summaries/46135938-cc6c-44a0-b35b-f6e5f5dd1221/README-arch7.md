# Supporting document for 'Reservoir inflows and release data, and optimised monthly rule curve ordinates (upper, lower and critical) for Pong and Bhakra reservoirs in Northern India' data

## Overview
- Contains time series data for Pong and Bhakra reservoirs: monthly inflows, net-evaporation loss, and releases (including spills).
- Provides optimised monthly rule curves that indicate target storage levels to maintain demand and avoid shortfalls.

## Data Files
- ReservoirData.csv
  - Monthly inflows, net-evaporation loss, and releases for Pong and Bhakra (units: million cubic metres, 10^6 m^3).
  - Scenarios: baseline (1989–2008), mid-century (2032–2050), end-century (2082–2100).
  - Future inflows generated by WEAP model forced with GFDL-CM3 CMIP climate projections.
- RuleCurve.csv
  - Optimised rule curve ordinates for Pong and Bhakra:
    - Smax: maximum storage (capacity)
    - URC: Upper Rule Curve (monthly target storage)
    - CRC: Critical Rule Curve (monthly trigger for rationing)
    - LRC: Lower Rule Curve (monthly target storage)
    - DS: Dead storage
  - Also includes rationing ratios (RR) applicable to gross demand when rationing is indicated.
  - When rationing is triggered, releases to meet demand are capped at RR × D (D = gross demand).

## Variables and Units
- Inflows, net-evaporation loss, releases: million cubic metres (10^6 m^3)
- Rule curve variables (Smax, URC, CRC, LRC, DS): million cubic metres (10^6 m^3)
- Rationing components: RR (ratio) and D (gross demand)

## Temporal Coverage
- Baseline period: 1989–2008
- Mid-century period: 2032–2050
- End-century period: 2082–2100

## Data Source and Modelling
- Inflows and releases derived from WEAP basin model outputs
- Future conditions driven by climate projections using GFDL-CM3 CMIP scenarios

## GIS and Data Use Implications
- Suitable for integration with spatial basins and reservoir operator shapefiles to visualize storage, inflows, and releases over time.
- Enables spatial-temporal analyses of reservoir performance, demand coverage, and potential rationing scenarios across months and centuries.
- Useful for scenario comparison (current vs. future projections) and for planning associated water allocation policies.
