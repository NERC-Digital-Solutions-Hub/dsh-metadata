# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Defra
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Confidentiality rationale
- Location confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
- Public-interest stance; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOIA 2000 / Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Access can identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (identifying 10x10 km squares) may be released under licence when approximate location is useful.
- Exact six-digit grid references require pre-processing by CEH or exceptional approval; very exceptional cases may grant external release if the requester demonstrates equivalent or higher IP confidentiality protection.
- Spatial data within survey squares could reveal square locations and is treated with the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## License terms and usage restrictions
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
- Upon license end, written confirmation of data destruction is required.
- No data or images may be released to third parties that could reveal square locations; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to monitor landowner compliance.
- Potential licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have relaxed IP confidentiality requirements compared to six-digit releases.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decisions.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, depending on arrangements.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates a governance-first approach to sensitive spatial data, balancing public value with safeguards for sampling integrity and landowner trust.
- Highlights need for clear licensing workflows, access controls, and data destruction obligations.
- Emphasizes the role of a central steward (CEH) to assess exceptionally sensitive access, with periodic reporting to governance bodies.
- Suggests integration with broader data strategy: data provenance, metadata standards, and cross-partner coordination to manage confidentiality while enabling useful analysis.
