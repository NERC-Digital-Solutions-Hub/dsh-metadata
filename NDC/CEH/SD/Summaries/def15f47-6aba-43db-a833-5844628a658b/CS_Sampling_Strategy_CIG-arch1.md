# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- This document outlines the evolution of the sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification used for Countryside Survey fieldwork up to 2007, linking contemporary methods to three decades of time-series data.
- Central idea: use a stratified, random sampling approach based on an environmental Land Classification to ensure representative coverage of Great Britain’s countryside and to enable robust, comparable national and country-level estimates over time.

## Core concepts: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling

- The Land Classification (ITE) provides strata (land classes) that reflect ecological and environmental differences across GB.
- Stratified, random sampling is used to avoid bias and to ensure samples represent all parts of the population (land types) rather than relying on pure randomness.
- Initial framework (1978) used a 1 km square sampling unit, with 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes; sampling aimed to capture typical variation across GB.
- National estimates are produced by combining mean habitat area per square within each land class with the total area of each land class.

## Evolution by survey year

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to define 32 land classes from 1228 centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid.
  - Classified surrounding four squares per centre, totaling about 6039 km squares.
  - Field work sampled 8 squares per land class (256 squares total).
  - National habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square times land-class area.

- 1984 – Second Field Survey
  - Employed the same sampling framework but expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Additional interpretation of change statistics; results published later.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey
  - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB (All Squares approach); urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated data collection of features from CS1984 plus the original vegetation quadrats.
  - Represented a shift toward more comprehensive, area-wide classification for regional/local estimates.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification and CS2000
  - Land Classification updated to support separate Scotland reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
  - To enable country-specific estimates, the framework introduced separate country-unit classifications (England & Wales, Scotland), creating 40 strata for better representation within each country.
  - Adjustments included sub-dividing classes into country units, aggregating rump classes when necessary, and adding 19 new squares (minimum 6 squares per new class) plus additional adjustments to balance representation across England and Wales.
  - An uplands module was added to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

- 2007 – Developments for CS2007 (Wales-focused reporting)
  - Wales required Wales-only reporting; as a result, Land Classes were further subdivided into 5 new Wales/England variants (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), increasing to 45 strata.
  - 43 Welsh additional squares were added; minimum 6 squares in each Welsh class.
  - England adjustments were made to account for the removal of Welsh squares; some English classes (5e, 15e) ended with 4 squares per class.
  - Revised maps and sampling framework published to reflect England, Wales, and Scotland distributions (CS2007).

## National estimates and country-unit reporting

- Change in Land Classification affects cross-survey comparability; a 2006 scoping study highlighted that changing the basis for national estimates can impact consistency.
- For country-unit reporting, estimates are produced using the latest country-specific Land Classification (with separate classifications for England with Wales and for Scotland), ensuring consistency within each country over time.
- Summary tables (CS2000 and CS2007) show how many squares were surveyed per class and country, along with sampling rates; overall GB totals reflect the integrated framework across surveys.

## Wales and uplands modules

- Wales-specific reporting requirements drove the subclassification of land classes (creating Wales-focused variants) and additional Welsh sampling to improve precision.
- An uplands module (CS2000) added 30 extra squares in upland/marginal upland land classes to boost estimates for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Data handling, interpretation, and documentation

- The document includes detailed descriptions of the sampling design, the evolution of land classes, the allocation of squares, and the rationale behind country-unit reporting.
- It references maps (Figures 4–7) and tables (Table 2, Table 3) detailing the distribution and numbers of sample squares across surveys.
- The authors acknowledge methodological guidance and provide a history of the Land Classification development and its applications to Countryside Survey data.

## Appendix and historical overview

- Appendix I offers a brief history of the ITE Land Classification, summarizing the major steps from the 1970s to 2007 (initial 32 classes to 40, then 45 with Wales), and the corresponding field surveys (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
- The evolution emphasizes the balance between broad national comparability and the need for country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) in the context of devolved governance.
