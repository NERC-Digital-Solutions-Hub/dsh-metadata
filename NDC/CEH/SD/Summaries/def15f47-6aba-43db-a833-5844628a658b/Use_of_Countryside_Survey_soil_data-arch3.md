# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Purpose and scope
  - Long-term soil monitoring across Countryside Survey (CS) years: 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - Aim to detect significant change over time; power analyses conducted to determine the number of samples needed (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sampling design
  - Each CS square contains 5 x-plots (randomly spaced) within the square; x-plots are not replicates due to differing land uses, soils, etc.
  - Some plots relocated across years due to destruction, access denial, or uncertainty in original location; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Across years, samples from the same repeat location are treated as from the same location, though actual sampling points may be 2–3 m apart around a 2 m × 2 m plot.
  - Sampling structure: multiple x-plots within each CS square; overall sampling design emphasizes wide spatial coverage for regional estimates.

- Sample location
  - Sampling focuses on CS x-plots within each square; repeat locations retain identity via unique codes, guiding longitudinal comparisons despite occasional relocation.
  - Across the CS, locations reflect a mix of land uses and soil types, influencing comparability over time.

- Sampling
  - Depths: top 15 cm of soil (8 cm depth for invertebrate samples).
  - Methods evolved: 1998 and 2007 used soil cores hammered in and extracted; 1978 used a soil pit to access the top 15 cm.
  - Field challenges: stones or very shallow soils can limit full core collection; some cores had photos and measurements of core dimensions in 2007.
  - Core and measurement logistics: not all samples collected as full cores; some plots/cores were partial or missing in certain years.

- Measurements
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements per core; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI analyses.
  - 2007 additions and notes: bulk density measured (not via ISO core method); detailed methods documented (Emmett et al. 2008); laboratory measurements vary by core and plot.
  - Variables collected (examples from CS2007): pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and other core-specific measurements.
  - Data coverage: some measurements available for all 591 squares; others limited to the original 256 squares or to a subset of x-plots; certain data released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009) indicated by asterisks.

- Statistical analysis
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land class can yield broad stock/change estimates that may be biased.
  - Where land classes are included, results become weighted national estimates of stock and change.
  - Bootstrapping is not always used; consider the CS design structure.
  - Recommend using a mixed model with square as a random factor to reflect the nesting (multiple x-plots within a square).
  - For CS designs (where spatial structure is not the primary interest), a dispersed set of observations can improve overall precision and regional coverage for estimates.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review existing CS publications exploiting the data (listed on the CS website) for methodological guidance.

- Data considerations and governance
  - Data heterogeneity across years and cores requires careful metadata management and harmonisation.
  - Some metadata and measurement details are documented in Emmett et al. (2008) and related CS reports; broader data governance and openness considerations are inherent in sharing underlying data and ensuring data quality.
  - The requirement to understand and align with data provenance, measurement methods, and sampling changes is essential for valid trend analyses.
