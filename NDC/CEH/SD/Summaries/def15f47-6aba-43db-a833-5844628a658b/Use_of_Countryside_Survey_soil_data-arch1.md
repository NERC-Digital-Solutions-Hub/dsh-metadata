# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Overview
  - Soils were sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007 as part of the Countryside Survey (CS).
  - Sampling scope evolved from 256 squares (1978, 1998) to all 591 CS squares (2007).
  - Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sampling design
  - Each CS square contains 5 x-plots randomly spaced within the square.
  - x-plots are not repeats (they can differ in land use, soil type, etc.).
  - x-plots can be relocated over time due to plot destruction, access issues, or relocation uncertainty.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating square 2, repeat plot 1.
  - Samples with the same identifier originate from the same location, though the exact sampling points are ~2–3 m apart around a 2 m x 2 m permanently marked plot.

- Sample location
  - Sampling locations are tied to CS x-plots within each square.
  - Repeat plots are used to track changes over time, subject to accessibility and land-use variation.

- Sampling
  - Depths: top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998 and 2007 used soil cores hammered into the soil; 1978 used soil pits.
  - Some soils prevented full core collection due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed core-dimension measurements were taken for some cores (2 of 4 cores).

- Measurements
  - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores had different measurements (as detailed in Table 1).
  - Measurements include: pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, bulk density (measured in 2007, not by ISO method), %C, %N, core dimensions, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and invertebrate data (e.g., collembola & mites) for specific cores.
  - Data availability: some measurements are only released after the Soils Report (November 2009).

- Data structure and core details
  - 591 squares sampled in 2007; all 591 squares for several core measurements.
  - Original 256 squares for measurements that were not collected in all 591 squares.
  - In 2007, different core types (e.g., black cores, long white cores, short white cores) carried various measurements listed in Table 1.
  - Measurements were taken from multiple cores per x-plot; core types and the number of samples per type varied.

- Statistical analysis
  - Analyses should account for statistical structure such as land class.
    - Ignoring land class can bias results toward stock and change of the population.
    - Including land classes yields national estimates weighted by land classes.
  - Bootstrapping is not always used; the CS framework should be considered.
  - Recommended approach: use mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within each CS square (up to 5 per square).
  - CS emphasizes dispersed sampling for efficiency and broader regional coverage; design-based approaches can still be used when spatial structure is not the focus.
  - Prior to analysis and interpretation, consult CEH and review existing CS publications exploiting these data (listed on the CS website).

- Data access and references
  - Some data limited by release timing (e.g., data released after November 2009).
  - Core methodological references include Emmett et al. (2008): Countryside Survey Soils 2007 – Method development, power analyses and protocols.
  - Data and methods are documented in the CS website and associated publications.
