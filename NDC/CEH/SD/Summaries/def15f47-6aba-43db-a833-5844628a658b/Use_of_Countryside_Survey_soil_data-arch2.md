# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Overview
  - Long-term soil monitoring across years 1978, 1998, and 2007 to assess environmental condition and policy performance.
  - Power analyses conducted to determine sample numbers needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).
  - Sampling spans 256 squares (1978/1998) and 591 CS squares (2007); not all measurements were made on every sample.

- Sampling Design and Scope
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots: 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - X-plots are not replicates due to diverse land uses and soil types; relocation occurs if plots are destroyed, access denied, or relocation is uncertain.
  - Each sampling location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1); samples with the same ID originate from the same location, though exact sampling points shift ~2–3 m within the 2m x 2m plot corners.

- Sample Collection Protocol
  - Depths: top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998/2007: soil cores used; 1978: soil pit used.
  - Occasionally full cores could not be collected due to stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and core dimension measurements were taken in 2007 on a subset of cores.

- Measurements and Laboratory Analyses
  - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (Table 1); samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method due to core requirements).
  - 2007 core measurement set includes: LOI, pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photography, depth of organic layer, soil texture (hand texture), soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, etc.
  - Sample counts vary: some measurements cover all 591 squares; others limited to original 256 squares; metals measured in only 2 of the 5 x-plots within original 256 squares.
  - Some data released only after the Soils Report (November 2009).

- Statistical Analysis and Data Use
  - Analyses must consider land class structure; failure to do so yields stock/change of the population rather than national estimates.
  - If land classes are accounted for, results are weighted to national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping not consistently used; CS design is not necessarily aimed at a single spatial structure, so dispersion of observations improves regional estimates.
  - Recommended approach: use mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots per CS square; where appropriate, adopt a dispersed sampling strategy for broader coverage.
  - Users should consult the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) before analysis and interpretation and review published CS analyses exploiting the data (list on CS website).
