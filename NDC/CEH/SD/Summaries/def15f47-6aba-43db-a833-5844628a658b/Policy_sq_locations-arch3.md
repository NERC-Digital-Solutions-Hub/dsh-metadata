# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose
  - Maximise the public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

- When and how locations may be released
  - Four-digit grid references (approximate locations) may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
  - For precise (six-digit) locations, CEH-preprocessing is preferred to avoid releasing locations; very exceptional external release under licence may occur if the requester demonstrates IP confidentiality/security equal to CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could enable identification of square locations; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need for the project.
  - Licences are finite in period and project-specific; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
  - At licence end, licensees must confirm destruction of location data in writing.
  - No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; consult CEH if uncertain.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must show project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
  - Licences include a clause preventing users from trying to derive precise square locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - Decisions on exceptional releases are made by CEH on behalf of NERC, applying this policy.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate terms; signed by a senior authorised official.
  - If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI Act and Environmental Regulations procedures.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to support reasonable pre-processing access within moderate demand; other requests are considered case-by-case.
  - Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data; CEH may provide scientific support as part of collaboration or for a fee, negotiated case-by-case.
