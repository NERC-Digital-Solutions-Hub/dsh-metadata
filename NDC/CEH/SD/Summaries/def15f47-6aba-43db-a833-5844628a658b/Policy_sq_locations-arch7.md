# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Sets out how survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares may be accessed.
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and within-square spatial data; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- CEH acts on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 for access requests.

## What can be released and at what precision
- Approximations: four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence to indicate which larger grid squares contain CS squares.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references are only considered in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, requiring CEH pre-processing to avoid release of locations; external release requires a legal demonstration that the external IP/data to be used has equal or higher confidentiality protections than CS data.
- Within-square spatial data (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) carry equivalent confidentiality and are released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Conditions and terms of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other purposes.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data remained secure and were destroyed.
- No third-party release that could compromise CS square confidentiality; no use to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar licence terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same IP confidentiality level.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) makes decisions on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report summarising access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data to help define requirements and ensure proper use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## How this affects GIS work
- Enables map-based analysis by identifying whether CS squares fall within larger predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) using four-digit references.
- Does not permit publishing or using data to pinpoint exact square locations or to track landowners.
- GIS workflows should incorporate licence terms, secure handling, and destruction timelines; avoid attempting to derive precise locations beyond permitted releases.

## Partners
- Current CS partners include CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, and Scottish Natural Heritage.
