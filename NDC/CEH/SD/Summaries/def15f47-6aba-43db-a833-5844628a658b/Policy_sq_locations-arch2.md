# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- The policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- The aim is to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- All other Countryside Survey (CS) data remains publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include CEH (as part of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for maintaining scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations can be released
- Release allowed to determine if survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing precise locations; if granted, organisations must show IP confidentiality similar to CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) pose similar confidentiality risks and are subject to the same exceptional-circumstances criteria.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licensing period.
- At the end of the licence, organisations must confirm destruction of location data.
- No data should be shared with third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; data must not be used to arrange visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same IP confidentiality level.
- License terms prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Licences must be signed by a senior person authorized for the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under applicable Acts and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decisions.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analysis within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case consideration for external organisations.
- Partners and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data under this policy; CEH involvement may be via collaboration or payment, negotiated case-by-case.
