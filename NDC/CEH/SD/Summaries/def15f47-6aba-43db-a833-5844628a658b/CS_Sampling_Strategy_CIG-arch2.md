# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the Countryside Survey sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification from 1978 to 2007.
- Aims to provide a consistent, time-series basis for monitoring environmental condition and policy performance across Great Britain.
- Emphasizes standardized data collection, verification, and reporting formats (e.g., field surveys, land classes, and national/country-level estimates).
- Highlights the need to maximise dataset value by linking with other data and ensuring accessibility to underlying data used to produce outputs.

## Key concept: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling
- The ITE Land Classification was developed to stratify land for national ecological surveys, using environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate).
- Stratification reduces bias and improves representativeness beyond simple random sampling.
- Early approach used a centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid (1 km squares classified within 32 Land Classes) with surrounding squares also allocated to classes.
- Classification outputs underpin the sampling framework and national estimates of habitat areas.

## Countryside Survey timeline and sampling frameworks

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
- Use of Indicator Species Analysis to define 32 land classes across GB.
- Sampling: eight 1 km squares per class (total 256 squares) from classified centers; habitat area estimates derived from class proportions and square areas.
- Focus: vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.

### 1984 – Second GB Survey
- Expansion to 12 km squares per land class (total 384 squares) to reflect land use and habitat mapping.
- Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- Results published in Landscape Changes in Britain.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990)
- Land Classification revised to classify every 1 km square in GB; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
- Field survey conducted on 508 squares; repeated vegetation quadrats from 1978.
- Land Classification maps used for national estimates; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.

### 1998/2000 – Developments of the ITE Land Classification (CS2000)
- Recognized need for regional and local estimates; introduced a broader land classification with more classes (up to 40) and groundwork for Scotland-only reporting.
- Transitioned to a framework capable of reporting by country units (England with Wales, Scotland) and required adjustments to maintain representation across countries.
- Implemented class sub-division and aggregation to ensure adequate representation in each country unit.
- Added Wales- and Scotland-specific reporting requirements; created 40 strata and added 19 extra squares to ensure representation of new classes; some classes in England retained smaller sample sizes due to resource/precision considerations.
- Introduced an uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.

### 2007 – Developments for Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
- Addressed Wales-specific reporting needs following devolution; added Welsh-only land classes (five new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increased Wales representation.
- Expanded Wales sampling by 43 additional squares, ensuring minimum representation (at least 6 squares) in each Welsh class; England sampling adjusted but not increased.
- Resulted in 45 strata (up from 40) for CS2007 and revised country-specific sampling maps for England, Wales, and Scotland.
- Overall CS2007 sample figures provided in the document’s tables (differing by class and country).

## National estimates and cross-survey consistency
- National estimates can be calculated using the latest Land Classification within a survey or by using the original 1990 classification for cross-survey comparability.
- The 2006 scoping study notes that changing the classification basis affects the consistency of stock estimates; internal (country-specific) estimates favor the latest classification, while cross-survey consistency may prefer the original classification approach.

## Outputs and accessibility
- Outputs include classified land maps, country-specific estimates, and time-series data showing habitat status and change.
- Emphasizes the importance of making underlying data accessible to users outside the final outputs to enhance value and reuse.

## Acknowledgements and references
- Acknowledges contributors and statistical guidance for each phase (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007).
- Provides extensive references documenting the development and application of the ITE Land Classification and Countryside Survey outputs.

## Relevance to environmental analysis and policy monitoring
- Provides a standardized, long-running framework for tracking environmental change and policy impacts across GB.
- Enables comparison over time and between country units (England & Wales, Scotland), while allowing Wales-only reporting and more granular Welsh classifications as needed.
- Supports integration with broader environmental datasets to enhance the value of monitoring datasets and facilitate data access for wider stakeholders.
