# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - National field protocol to monitor soil quality, Calluna vulgaris foliar nitrogen, and freshwater biota across GB.
  - Aims to provide a spatially referenced, time-series dataset compatible with prior surveys (e.g., 1978 CS survey) to inform policy-relevant biodiversity and soil monitoring.

- Types of sampling and coordination
  - Three sampling domains:
    - Soil sampling (CS2000 field surveyors; processed at ITE Merlewood)
    - Calluna sampling (CS2000 field surveyors; processed at ITE Merlewood)
    - Freshwater biota sampling (accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff; coordinated with CS2000 field teams)
  - Geographic scope: sampling conducted in 1 km square units, covering representative land classes and land cover types to enable national-scale analyses.

- Soil sampling protocol
  - Five replicate soil samples per 1 km square (centered on X-plots within CS2000 sampling framework).
  - In each X-plot center, three soil cores are collected using designated pipe sizes (long black pipe and white pipes) at specified offsets (approx. 15 cm N/E/W of the centre).
  - Samples include soil chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status; processed at ITE Merlewood.
  - Samples shipped promptly to Merlewood in labeled envelopes and bags; quick processing emphasized for certain core types.
  - Detailed procedural steps provided for field collection, packaging, labeling, and post-collection handling.

- Calluna sampling protocol
  - Within each 1 km square, collect Calluna vulgaris foliar tissue (current year growth, CYG) for nitrogen analysis.
  - Sample size: 30–50 g fresh weight from multiple Calluna plants; random selection within the square.
  - Proper labeling, drying (if wet), sealing, and mailing to ITE Merlewood in provided envelopes.

- Freshwater sampling
  - Conducted by IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 field teams; sampling times planned to align with survey activities.

- Equipment, packaging, and distribution
  - Standard CS2000 field equipment supplemented with specific items for soil(Calluna) sampling (e.g., pipes, envelopes, bags).
  - Items distributed to teams by regional coordinators; envelopes and bags numbered to match ITE square and plot identifiers.
  - Clear instructions for packing, labeling, and ensuring integrity of samples during transit.

- Data collection, documentation, and outputs
  - Samples and data linked to field observation books (FABs) and recording forms.
  - Outputs enable integration with existing base maps (e.g., OS maps) and theme-specific maps for analysis and reporting.
  - Emphasis on maintaining an audit trail and traceability from field observations to laboratory analyses.

- Post-survey procedures
  - Immediate data checks at the end of each day to ensure no features are omitted.
  - Data may be transposed to fresh maps/forms only if necessary (to recover from damage), but this is discouraged.
  - Arrangements made to transport FABs and samples back to ITE Stations promptly.

- Annex: GPS data collection
  - Step-by-step guidance for battery checks, satellite availability (minimum four satellites; PDOP ideally < 6), and data logging modes for stationary and moving features.
  - File naming conventions require a square identifier and plot/feature ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to ensure traceability.
  - Instructions for creating and managing data files, logging processes, and stopping/starting logging.
  - Tips for dealing with obstructions, battery management, and GPS almanac updates.
  - Usage of the provided attribute reference and keypad for efficient data entry.

- Photography
  - Each vegetation plot is photographed to document appearance and spatial context; one camera per team.
  - Photos must include square/plot identifiers and reference features on a visible board; aim for clear, well-composed images with landmarks and minimal sky capture.

- Quality, governance, and consistency
  - Standardized procedures across soil, Calluna, and freshwater sampling to ensure comparability over time and space.
  - Documentation and labeling practices designed to preserve data provenance and enable efficient cross-referencing between field observations, lab analyses, and maps.
  - Coordination with external institutes (ITE Merlewood, IFE) highlights inter-organizational data handling and sample processing workflows.

- Practical notes for monitoring authors
  - The handbook provides explicit, repeatable field methods to support robust, time-series biodiversity and soil monitoring.
  - Emphasizes rapid sample handling and transport to laboratories to maintain sample integrity.
  - Includes comprehensive guidance on equipment, data file management, and post-survey data management to support transparent, policy-relevant reporting.
