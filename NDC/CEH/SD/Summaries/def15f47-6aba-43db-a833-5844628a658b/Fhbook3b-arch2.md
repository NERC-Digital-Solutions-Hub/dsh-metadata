# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview and Aims
- Provides standardized methods for monitoring land cover, landscape features, and vegetation across Great Britain to produce time-series data for environmental health and policy performance.
- Aims to link ground data with remote sensing, enable ground-truthing and broader projections, and ensure transparency and reuse of underlying data.

## Sampling Framework
- Core coverage: approximately 568 1 km squares across England, Scotland, Wales, and the Isle of Man; many squares re-sampled from CS1990.
- Structure: six ITE Research Stations manage survey teams; each station covers about 95 squares; typical square surveys take ~ four days.
- Design considerations: country-unit stratification, new land classes, upland representations; seasonal timing and logistics optimized to minimize observer variation and travel time.

## Data Collection Framework and Outputs
- Three core elements: mapping, recording plant species in plots, and sampling (soil, Calluna, etc.).
- Outputs:
  - Time-series maps of land cover and landscape features with change-detection.
  - Plot-based vegetation data using standardized plots and data-recording forms.
  - Soil and Calluna sampling data where applicable.
  - Broad Habitats framework aligned with UK Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs); both plottable and mappable habitat representations.
- Outputs are designed to support policy assessment, biodiversity monitoring, and integration with remote-sensing data.

## Data Recording, FABs, and Coding
- FABs (Field Assessment Booklets) consolidate mapping sheets and data pages for each square.
- Coding system includes primary/secondary land-cover codes aligned with CS1990, universal map-feature codes, and specialized codes for habitat types and mosaics.
- Plot types and sampling design:
  - X plots (large 200 m² plots), Y plots (2 m × 2 m), U plots (unenclosed upland plots), and additional plot types for boundaries, margins, hedgerows, streams, roads, etc.
- Emphasis on data accuracy, consistency, documentation of uncertainties, and traceability across maps and time.

## Field Procedures, Permissions, Equipment, and Safety
- Site access: obtain landowner permissions in advance; if refused, abandon the square or relocate if possible.
- Equipment and safety: standardized equipment lists; robust navigation, safety, and data-collection aids; clear responsibilities for care/replacement.
- Data integrity: standardization through training and field handbook guidance; on-site checks and post-field reviews recommended.

## Vegetation Sampling and Plot Design
- Plot layout and types:
  - Areal (large) Wally plots and nested 4 m² subplots for species presence and percent cover.
  - Y plots (2 m × 2 m) for habitat sampling; U plots for upland habitats; B plots at field boundaries; A plots along arable margins; H and D plots for hedgerows; S/W plots for streams/watersides; R/V plots for roads/verges.
- Recording:
  - A standardized 200-species list with percentage cover (in 5% increments); unlisted species recorded with Latin/common names.
  - GPS-tagging and physical markers used to ensure accurate time-series relocation.
  - Bryophytes and lichens recorded from restricted lists with specific guidelines.

## Data Quality, Standardization, and Training
- Strong emphasis on reducing observer variation to improve the statistical reliability of change data.
- Training and a comprehensive Field Handbook are prerequisites for CS2000 field teams.
- Quality control applied across planning, data collection, mapping, and data entry.

## Background Context, Applications, and Policy Relevance
- Alignment with international and national policy frameworks (Rio Declaration, Biodiversity Action Plans, EU directives) and government objectives.
- Data underpin policy assessment, biodiversity monitoring, landscape-change detection, and integration with satellite remote sensing and topographic mapping.
- Supports long-term monitoring, cross-year standardization, and informing Government Departments, NGOs, and stakeholders.

## Annexes and Supplementary Information
- Annexes cover GPS data collection procedures, aerial photography and API guidance, and erosion-related context to situate field data within broader environmental monitoring efforts.

## Outputs for Analysts and Data Accessibility
- Primary data products include time-series land cover and landscape-feature maps, Broad Habitat-based reports, and BAP-aligned outputs (plottable and mappable).
- Strong emphasis on accessibility and reusability of underlying data for scrutiny, cross-study analyses, and policy evaluation.

## Section 10: Sampling (Soil, Calluna, Freshwater)
- Soil sampling:
  - Five replicate soil samples per 1 km square within each X-plot; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing (pH, ignition losses, heavy metals, fauna diversity, microbiology).
  - Sampling involves three cores per X-plot center, with standardized pipes and careful packaging for postal transport.
  - Detailed procedures for locating sampling points, extracting soil cores, and packaging/shipping; emphasis on rapid processing for certain samples.
- Calluna sampling:
  - Collects current year growth (CYG) shoots for nitrogen deposition analysis; sampling within Calluna vulgaris in each square; random selection from plants; properly labeled, air-dried, and mailed to ITE Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff in coordination with field teams; integrated timing with the rest of the survey.
- Section 11 (Photography) and Section 12 (Procedures after Survey) provide standardized photographic documentation and post-survey data handling, including end-of-day checks and transportation of FABs and samples to ITEStations.

## Annex 1: GPS Data Collection
- Step-by-step guidance on battery power, satellite checks, stationary vs moving logging, file naming conventions, data-rate settings, and minimizing position error (PDOP guidance).
- Emphasis on ensuring robust GPS relocation with unique file names per plot/feature and hints for avoiding common issues (obstructions, antenna placement, almanac updates).

## Attribute Reference and Mapping Aids
- Provides reference frameworks for quickly selecting plot identifiers and aligning feature codes with the FAB and mapping templates to streamline data entry.
