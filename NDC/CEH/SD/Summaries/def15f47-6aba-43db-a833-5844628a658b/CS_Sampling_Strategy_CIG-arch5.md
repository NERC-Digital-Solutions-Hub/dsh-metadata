The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Introduction
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey 2007 as the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification, a 30-year development linked to previous surveys (1978 onward).
- Emphasises that understanding prior methods is essential because current methodology is tightly connected to historical approaches.

## The importance of stratified sampling
- Stratification is used to reduce bias and ensure representative sampling across diverse landscapes.
- Stratified sampling partitions land into discrete strata (land classes) so that all parts of the population are represented, avoiding over- or under-sampling of extreme cases.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification (early version)
- Early work (mid-1970s) created a national ecological sampling framework using 1 km squares as sampling units.
- Due to limited computing power, a center-square approach within a 15x15 km grid was used, classifying 1228 squares initially (plus surrounding squares) to form 32 Land Classes.
- The first GB field survey (1978) sampled eight squares per class (256 total) to estimate habitat areas by class.

## The sampling framework for CS1978 (1978)
- 8 km squares per Land Class; total of 256 field survey squares.
- National habitat estimates calculated as the mean habitat area per square in each class multiplied by the land area of that class.

## The sampling framework for CS1984 (1984)
- Employed the same framework but increased the sample to 12 squares per class (total 384).
- Aim was to improve national estimates of landscape features; results published later.

## Application of the ITE Land Classification to Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
- Land Classification updated to all-squares GB coverage (more comprehensive, broader data integration).
- First Land Cover Map of GB linked to this programme.
- Field survey comprised 508 squares; all previous features were recorded again, plus repeat vegetation quadrats.
- Results informed by the 1990 Land Classification.

## Developments of the ITE Land Classification ( CS1990 to CS2000)
- Recognition that every GB square would benefit from classification; attempted to reclassify using surrogates for climatic/geographic factors due to computing limits.
- Compared new classification attempts with the original 1228-square framework; 62% of original squares matched, with non-matching squares falling into neighboring classes.
- Result: a revised classification that could approximate the original framework while enabling broader spatial coverage, though some class representations shifted.

## Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
- Considered sample numbers for modules and the need for separate England/Wales and Scotland estimates, plus upland habitat reliability.
- Introduced separate country estimates by subdividing Land Classes into country-unit versions (England with Wales, Scotland) and aggregating where necessary to maintain representation.
- Expanded to 40 strata; added 19 squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; added 11 more squares to balance between England and Wales.
- Wales received enhanced sampling due to prominence of upland habitats, with a dedicated uplands module to improve country-specific estimates.
- The revised maps show England-with-Wales and Scotland classifications for sampling.

## Survey of uplands in England and Wales (CS2000 module)
- An additional 30 squares placed in upland/marginal upland Land Classes to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

## Summary of CS2000
- Detailed counts by class and country were provided (noting total GB squares, distribution across England/Wales/Scotland, and sampling rates per class). Total GB squares sampled across surveys progressed from CS1978 through CS2000, culminating in CS2000’s expanded framework to support country-level estimates.

## Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2007 (Welsh-only reporting)
- Devolution created a need for Wales-only reporting; Wales required more dedicated sample representation than in CS2000.
- Adjustments for Wales-only reporting:
  - Sub-divided classifications into country-unit versions (creating 5 new Welsh-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Increased total strata to 45; added 43 additional Welsh squares (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class).
  - England adjustments did not require proportional increases; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained at four squares each, deemed sufficient for reporting purposes.
- The revised class map for England, Wales and Scotland reflects the CS2007 framework and sampling squares.

## Data Coverage and Sampling Details (high-level)
- England: sampling rates and class counts adjusted to reflect Wales integration and devolved reporting needs.
- Wales: enhanced representation with dedicated Welsh classes and additional squares to support Wales-only estimates.
- Scotland: maintained representation within the broader multi-country framework.
- Overall GB sampling increased from CS1990 to CS2007, enabling country-specific estimates and improved precision for upland and Wales-specific habitats.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Implications
- Versioning and provenance: multiple land classifications across surveys require careful version control to ensure comparability over time.
- Metadata needs: detailed documentation of Land Classification definitions, class boundaries, and changes across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
- Country-specific reporting: framework supports England, Scotland, and Wales-specific estimates but necessitates clear delineation of class subdivisions and sampling allocations per country.
- Data interoperability: cross-survey compatibility hinges on explicit mapping between old and new Land Classes and consistent methodology for estimating national and regional habitat areas.
- Updates and maintenance: upland modules and country-unit subdivisions introduce additional data dimensions that must be tracked for ongoing governance and sharing.
