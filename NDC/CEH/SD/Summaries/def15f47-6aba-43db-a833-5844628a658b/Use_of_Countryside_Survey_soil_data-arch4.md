# Sampling design

- Overview
  - Soil sampling occurred in CS in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - In 1978 and 1998, the same 256 squares were sampled; in 2007, soils were collected from all 591 CS squares, with some measurements not made on all samples.
  - Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 randomly spaced x-plots.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types.
  - Plots may be relocated over time due to destruction, permission, or uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) referring to square 2, repeat plot 1.
  - Exact sampling positions are about 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot corners.

- Sampling methods
  - Top 15 cm of soil sampled (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998/2007 used soil cores hammered in and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit.
  - In some soils, full core collection was not possible due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed core-dimension measurements were taken for some cores.

- Measurements and laboratory work
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1990: some soil mapping occurred.
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements; no chemical analyses by soil horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
  - 2007: bulk density measured (not by ISO whole-core method); table lists various measurements per core (e.g., pH, %C, %N, metals, Olsen P, moisture, texture, depth of organic layer, etc.).
  - Table 1 indicates measurements were taken across the 591 squares; some measurements were taken only on subsets (e.g., 256 original squares for certain analyses).

- Data availability and metadata
  - Some data were released only after the Soils Report published November 2009.
  - Data coverage varies by sample and measurement type; not all measurements exist for all cores or squares.
  - Documentation and details are provided in Emmett et al. (2008) and related CS publications accessible via the CS website.

- Statistical analysis and interpretation guidance
  - Analyses should consider land class structure; ignoring it can bias results toward stock/change rather than national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; a mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to account for multiple x-plots within a square.
  - Design-based approaches favor dispersed observations for regional estimates; spatial structure is not the primary interest.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review published CS analyses available on the CS website.
