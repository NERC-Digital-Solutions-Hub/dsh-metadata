# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Standardized field data collection for Countryside Survey 2000 and beyond.
- Covers sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater), photography, GPS data, data handling, and post-survey procedures.
- Includes extensive taxonomic code lists and mapping conventions to ensure consistency with CS1990 and across modules.

## Data Standards, Codes, and Taxonomy
- Large, structured codes for flora and mosses/lichens to support consistent identification and downstream analysis.
- Examples include mappings such as Athy/ Blec spi. and Dryo/ Pter aqu. across Ferns, Forbs/Woody species, Mosses/Lichens, etc.
- Emphasis on using primary CS1990-CS2000 code frameworks where possible to preserve time-series comparability.
- Detailed annotation of species, habitats, boundaries, and related features to support change detection and reporting.

## Sampling Types and Rationale (Section 10)
- Three sampling types:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by accredited IFE staff)
- Objective: develop baseline, spatially referenced soil data and Calluna nitrogen indicators; enable national assessments linked to deposition and biodiversity indicators.

## Soil Sampling Protocol (Section 10.6–10.7)
- 1 km square sampling within CS2000 framework; five replicate soil samples per square.
- Sampling in each X-plot center: three cores collected using specific pipe types (long black pipe; two short white pipes) at designated positions around the centre plot.
- Sample handling:
  - Short white pipes: post immediately in supplied envelopes/bags to ITE Merlewood
  - Long black pipe: stored for later collection by regional coordinators
- Equipment distribution:
  - Rotationally assigned items (by regional coordinators) plus standard CS2000 equipment
  - Envelopes, bags, pipes labeled with square and plot identifiers
- Documentation: note any field observations affecting sampling (e.g., roots, obstacles) in the envelope with the sample
- Processing: soil chemistry, soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status analyzed at ITE Merlewood

## Calluna Sampling (Section 10.9–10.10)
- Within squares containing Calluna vulgaris, collect current year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants.
- Label and seal samples properly; allow air circulation if wet; dispatch to ITE Merlewood via designated channels; obtain receipt for reimbursement.

## Freshwater Sampling (Section 10.11)
- Conducted by IFE staff under coordination with CS2000, potentially in the same square and time frame as field teams.

## Photography (Section 11)
- One camera per team; photographs of every vegetation plot to document appearance and reference features.
- Reference features must be obvious, permanent, and visible; photos should include square/plot IDs and marker boards.
- Photos should fill an appropriate portion of the frame and minimize excessive sky.

## Procedures After Survey (Section 12)
- Review data sheets daily to avoid omissions.
- Transposition of data to new maps/forms should be a last resort and only if original data is damaged.
- FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE stations promptly.

## GPS Data Collection (Annex 1)
- Step-by-step GPS data collection guidance:
  - Ensure sufficient satellite connections, PDOP below 6 for good 3D accuracy.
  - Record stationary (plot location) and moving features (boundaries) with dedicated file names (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to reflect square and plot identifiers.
  - Create individual data files for each plot/feature and use attribute lists to quickly select IDs.
  - Logging: start/stop procedures, time stamps, and data management on site.
  - Battery management, almanac updates, and handling obstructions (elevate antenna if needed).
- File naming and attribute references are designed to integrate GPS data with FABs and plot designations.

## Data Handling, Documentation, and Integration
- Emphasis on ensuring data is captured in consistent formats, with parcels, plots, and features clearly labeled for seamless re-location and long-term trend analysis.
- Data outputs are designed to align with national biodiversity indicators and cross-sector policy needs.
- Annexes provide GPS data flow, relocation procedures, and guidance for field adaptability.

## Risks, Challenges, and Practical Considerations
- Observer variation and the need for standardized training to maintain time-series integrity.
- Access permissions and landowner cooperation can constrain sampling; contingency planning is essential.
- Complex boundary and habitat mosaics require disciplined coding and careful field judgment.
- Coordination across modules and organizations (CS2000, ITE, IFE) necessitates robust data governance.

## Endnotes and Operational Resources
- Annexes include GPS data collection guidelines, data flow for CS1990-to-CS2000 transitions, and detailed equipment/distribution lists.
- The handbook emphasizes training, quality control, and practical adaptability for atypical field conditions.
