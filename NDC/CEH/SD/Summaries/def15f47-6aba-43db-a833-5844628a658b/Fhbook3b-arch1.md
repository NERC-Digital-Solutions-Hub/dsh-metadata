# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- The document outlines CS2000 field methodologies for nationwide land-use and biodiversity monitoring, including soil, Calluna flora, freshwater biota, vegetation plots, photography, and GPS data collection, with a focus on standardised data capture, time-series compatibility, and linking field data to policy objectives.

## Scope and objectives
- National, spatially referenced sampling in 1 x 1 km squares across Great Britain.
- Three primary sampling domains:
  - Soil sampling (CS2000 field surveyors).
  - Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling for deposition-related nitrogen studies.
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff).
- Data are used to establish baseline soil quality, biodiversity status, and support policy-relevant analyses; field data are designed for time-series consistency.

## Study design and sampling framework
- CS2000 builds on CS1990/CS2000 lineage with standardized plots and sampling to enable change detection and policy alignment.
- Each square contains X-plots (centre plots) used for soil sampling and vegetation assessment; five soil sampling locations are surveyed per square across centre plots.
- Data capture relies on a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) to consolidate sheets, maps, and codes; emphasis on clear, unambiguous entries and future relocatability.

## Soil sampling (section 10. Sampling)
- Five replicate soil samples per square are collected from X-plots within each centre plot; sampling aims for representative coverage across Land Class and Land Cover types.
- Each square’s center plot sampling protocol specifies precise location points (e.g., 15 cm N of centre for the first core; subsequent cores at defined offsets).
- Sampling depths and procedures are standardized, with three soil cores per X-plot (two white short pipes and one long black pipe) and explicit steps for core extraction, labeling, and packaging.
- Samples are packaged in labelled envelopes and mailed to ITE Merlewood for processing; rapid transport is emphasized for two smaller cores due to shorter shelf life.
- Calluna sampling (10.8–10.10) uses current-year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) collected randomly from Calluna vulgaris plants; samples are bagged, sealed, and dispatched to Merlewood.

## Calluna sampling specifics
- Within each square containing Calluna vulgaris, collect CYG shoots, seal properly, and dispatch promptly (either from an ITE research station or by direct mail with receipts claimed on T&S forms).
- The exercise supports analysis of foliar nitrogen as a proxy for atmospheric nitrogen deposition.

## Freshwater sampling
- Conducted by specially trained IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 coordinators; sampling occurs concurrently with field surveys to minimize disruption and ensure timing alignment.

## Vegetation sampling and plot types
- Vegetation plots are mapped and surveyed using a grid of areal, nested, and boundary plots (various “A” to “W” style plot identifiers) to capture species composition, abundance, and cover.
- A comprehensive plot-based system records the top 200 species per plot, presence/absence, and cover categories; bryophytes and lichens are recorded from a defined list.
- Permanent markers and relocation rules ensure consistent resurvey across years.

## Data recording, mapping, and quality control
- FAB consolidates data sheets, maps, and codes; careful, neat entries reduce interpretation variance.
- Data are linked to policy-relevant habitats and Broad/BAP classifications, with specified data layers:
  - Mapping data (CS1990–CS2000 codes, new BAP interpretations)
  - Plot-level data (vegetation, species, percent cover)
  - Site metadata (parcel ownership, physiography)
- Relocation procedures, plan verification, and photographic documentation are essential QC steps.

## GPS data collection (Annex 1)
- GPS data collection is supported with step-by-step instructions:
  - Check battery power and satellite availability; require at least four satellites and an acceptable PDOP (<6 for good 3D fixes).
  - Record stationary positions at plot centers and moving features along boundaries when required.
  - Create plot-specific data files named with square and plot identifiers (e.g., 501X4.PSE).
  - Define data sampling rate (1-second intervals) and assign plot/feature names via an attribute list.
  - Start/stop logging with explicit prompts; manage battery, almanac updates, and obstruction issues (e.g., hedges/buildings).
- Guidance for transferring GPS data to storage devices and for dealing with obstructions and antenna positioning is provided.

## Photography protocol
- Each team carries a camera and film stock; photograph every vegetation plot to capture general appearance and landmark references.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and resolvable in future visits; include square and plot numbers on a visible board at the plot edge.
- Images should fill an appropriate portion of the frame with minimal sky, balancing coverage and clarity.

## Procedures after survey
- Daily data reconciliation: verify that all features are recorded; avoid post-hoc transposition unless necessary due to data loss.
- Arrange timely transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations for processing and archiving.

## Equipment, distribution, and logistics
- Equipment (e.g., core sampling pipes, bags, GPS gear) is distributed to field teams via regional coordinators; standardized packing and labeling procedures ensure traceability and proper sample routing.

## Special topics
- The Field Handbook situates CS2000 within soil sustainability research, emphasizing baseline data development, soil chemistry, soil fauna, and microbiological status alongside biodiversity monitoring.
- Annexes provide detailed taxonomic reference points and coding schemes used for vegetation and mosses/lichens in CS2000 data capture.

## Summary for data-focused analysts
- CS2000 provides a rigorously standardized, multi-tactor field protocol for soil, flora, and freshwater data across GB, enabling robust time-series analyses and policy-aligned biodiversity assessment.
- Key data streams include soil chemistry, soil fauna and microbiology, foliar chemistry (Calluna), vegetation plots with species abundance, and freshwater biota, all georeferenced within 1 km squares.
- Data capture is centralized via FABs, with strict procedures for sample collection, labeling, shipping, and documentation to ensure traceability and reproducibility.
- GPS and photography protocols supplement field data, ensuring precise location data and verifiable plot context for future comparisons.
- The methodology emphasizes data quality, standardization, clear documentation, and timely data transfer to central facilities for processing and archiving.
