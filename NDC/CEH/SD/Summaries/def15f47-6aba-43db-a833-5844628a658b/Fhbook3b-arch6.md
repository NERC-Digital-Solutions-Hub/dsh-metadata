# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Purpose and scope
- Provides standardised guidelines for field data collection across GB to support land cover, habitats, vegetation monitoring, and policy-relevant analyses.
- Builds a time-series framework (CS2000) with change-detection capabilities and links to remote sensing validation.
- Aims to enable robust, comparable data across observers and sites, supporting national biodiversity reporting and landscape interpretation.

## Data collection framework
- Three main sampling streams:
  - Soil sampling: five replicate soil cores per 1 km square for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), fauna diversity, and microbiology; samples processed at ITE Merlewood.
  - Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen sampling to relate to nitrogen deposition and critical loads; standardized within Calluna vulgaris stands.
  - Freshwater sampling: conducted by accredited IFE staff in coordination with field teams.
- Vegetation and habitat data: core plot-based data capture with nested plots to quantify species presence/absence and % cover; bryophytes, lichens, and a curated vascular plant list recorded for consistency with historic surveys.

## Plot design and sampling strategy
- Plot types and layouts:
  - X plots: 200 m2 core plots with nested sub-plots for detailed sampling.
  - Y plots: five small 2 m x 2 m plots to broaden sampling of semi-natural habitats.
  - U plots: up to 10 unenclosed plots in Plottable Broad Habitats.
  - B plots: boundary plots at field boundaries (hedgerows, walls, fences).
  - A plots: arable field margin plots (100 x 1 m).
  - H/D plots: hedgerow woody-plant data and hedgerow diversity.
  - S/R plots: streamside and roadside vegetation plots.
- Plot relocation and permanence: permanent markers (metal plates) and fixed landscape references; relocation aided by ground marks, photographs, and plans.
- Seasonal consistency and coverage: systematic, repeatable survey sequence to minimise seasonal variation; access permissions confirmed at each site.

## Data collection tools and procedures
- Field Assessment Books (FABs): central data capture and documentation; ensure ownership, physography, vegetation types, boundaries, and species codes are consistently recorded.
- Mapping and coding: combination of primary/secondary codes on enlarged 1:10,000 maps; universal codes for boundary status; clear mapping of boundaries and features.
- Equipment and safety: comprehensive field kit (GPS, FABs, marking plates, safety gear, recording sheets) with responsibilities for care and maintenance.
- Data capture discipline: neat FABs, legible maps, and standardized plotting to support reliable extraction and analysis.

## Data quality, training, and standardisation
- Emphasis on consistent data collection across observers to enable robust cross-site analyses.
- Training and a detailed Field Handbook underpin quality control and reproducibility.
- Documentation practices include precise plot identifiers, boundary coding, and consistent nomenclature (with compatibility to historic names).

## Data management, processing, and outputs
- Output framework aligned with biodiversity reporting (National Biodiversity Action Plan) and time-series monitoring of upland and unenclosed habitats.
- Change detection focus:
  - Old squares: detect changes since 1990 baselines.
  - New squares: establish baselines for future change analyses.
- Data integration with landscape context: mapping of broad habitats to support policy-relevant reporting and link field data to larger-scale interpretations.
- Annexes and supplementary content provide additional contexts for analysis (e.g., erosion recording, ponds, and boundary/hedgerow coding schemes).

##GPS, photography, and annexed guidance
- GPS data collection: step-by-step guidance for logging stationary and moving features, file naming conventions (e.g., square and plot IDs like 501X4.PSE), data rate settings, PDOP considerations (target < 6 for good accuracy), handling almanac updates, and troubleshooting.
- Photography: one camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot with reference features and plot identifiers visible on a marker board; aims for clear, repeatable reference points.
- Post-survey procedures: checks for omissions; recommended to transfer FABs and samples promptly to ITE stations.
- Annex 1: GPS data collection specifics, battery management, file naming conventions, and attribute reference sheets to speed data entry.

## Supplementary contexts
- Taxonomic coding: extensive coding conventions for mosses, lichens, and vascular plants to ensure consistent species identification and historical compatibility.
- Ponds, erosion, and other biodiversity contexts: integrated components to broaden monitoring beyond primary vegetation data.

## Relevance for data support
- The handbook directly supports data discovery, quality, and usability by standardising data collection, storage (FABs and codes), and metadata (plot IDs, boundaries, ownership).
- Facilitates self-service data exploration through consistent formats, enabling dashboards, reports, and landscape-scale analyses.
- Addresses common data-collection challenges (interobserver variance, patchy data, cross-system integration) by providing structured procedures, validation, and training prerequisites.
