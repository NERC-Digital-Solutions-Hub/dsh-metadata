# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the field-survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) and how it evolved with the ITE Land Classification over time.
- Emphasises stratified, random sampling to ensure samples are representative of Britain’s diverse landscapes.
- Uses the ITE Land Classification as the backbone for stratification and for deriving national habitat estimates.
- Documents how sampling and classifications were adapted to support country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland) and later Wales-only reporting.

## Core concepts and methodology
- Stratified sampling: Population split into discreet land classes (strata) to reduce bias and capture ecological variability.
- Land Classification: ITE Land Classification groups land into classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to guide sampling and interpretation.
- Sample unit and layout: The basic unit is a 1 km square; a centre square is selected and surrounded by adjacent squares to form the sample for a class.
- National estimates: Calculated by combining the mean habitat area per square within a class with the total area of that class.
- Data outputs: Field survey data (habitat, vegetation, land-use features), habitat maps, and tabulated estimates used in national reporting.

## Chronological development and key changes

- 1978 — Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - ISA-based classification defining 32 land classes from 1 km squares.
  - Sampling: 8 squares per class, total of 256 squares.
  - Output: Baseline national estimates of habitat areas by class.

- 1984 — Second Field Survey
  - Expanded sampling to 12 squares per land class (384 squares total).
  - National estimates still based on the original 1978 Land Classification.

- 1990 — All Squares Land Classification (CS1990) and Third Field Survey
  - Land Classification revised to use data from all GB 1 km squares; urban and sea corrections applied.
  - 508 squares surveyed in CS1990.
  - Introduced linkage to the first Land Cover Map of GB (satellite-derived).

- 2000 — Developments for CS2000 (England, Wales, Scotland)
  - Separate country estimates introduced: England with Wales and Scotland.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions, creating 40 strata (up from 32).
  - Additional “country balance” squares: 19 extra squares to ensure representation of new classes, plus 11 more squares to balance between England and Wales.
  - Isle of Man adjustments: replacing IOM squares with new England squares for country estimates.
  - Upland habitat sampling module considered to improve accuracy in upland regions.

- 2007 — Developments for CS2007 (Welsh reporting emphasis)
  - Wales-specific reporting requirements driven devolution; added Welsh-only adjustments.
  - Welsh sub-divisions created: five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), increasing strata to 45.
  - Welsh sampling increased: 43 additional squares to ensure minimum representation (6 squares per Welsh class).
  - England adjustments: two English classes (5e, 15e) remain with only 4 squares each; a scoping study deemed this precision acceptable.
  - Overall framework updated to support Wales-only estimates while maintaining England and Scotland data.

## Uplands module and scope
- CS2000 and CS2007 include targeted sampling in upland and marginal upland areas to improve habitat estimates in those environments.
- Additional module involvement funded by DETR, MAFF, WO/CCW to place 30 extra squares within upland Land Classes.

## Outputs, estimations, and mappings
- Land Class maps and sample square maps illustrate the spatial framework (Figures 4–7 in the document).
- Tables summarize the distribution of sample squares per country, class, and survey year (e.g., Tables 2 and 3).
- National estimates are produced by combining class-level data (area and habitat features per square) with class-area proportions, enabling consistent estimates across time and across the three countries.
- The document discusses the implications of changing classifications on comparability and endorses using the latest classification for consistency within surveys.

## Data challenges and considerations
- Representativeness: Ensuring adequate representation across all land classes, including very large or very small classes, and across countries.
- Comparability across years: Changes in the Land Classification can affect the consistency of national estimates; guidance favors using the latest classification for within-survey consistency while acknowledging cross-survey comparability issues.
- Balancing country-specific needs: Devolution necessitated country-specific estimates (England, Scotland, Wales), prompting subdivisions and targeted sampling adjustments.
