# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Policy aims to maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidential to preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys to maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports public-interest goals; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## Conditions under which locations may be released and precision levels
- Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10x10 km grid square) may be released under licence when approximate locations are valuable.
- Six-digit precise locations are only provided in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external pre-processing by CEH is preferred to avoid release.
- If exceptional release is considered, the requester must demonstrate in legal terms that their IP/data to be used has equal or higher confidentiality protection than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares could reveal locations and will be released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.

## Specific licence conditions
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed and written confirmation provided at the end of the licence period.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise CS square locations; cannot inform visits to squares or check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; a clause prohibits attempts to derive exact square locations.

## Responsibilities and processes
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decisions under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report summarising licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe for CS partners; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid and will be negotiated case-by-case.
