# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007, built on the ITE Land Classification.
- Emphasizes stratified, random sampling to ensure representative national estimates and a time-series through successive surveys.
- Highlights how the Land Classification underpinning the sampling evolved across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, and how this affects data comparability, country-level reporting, and targeted modules (e.g., uplands).

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification
- The ITE Land Classification originated in the 1970s to stratify land for national ecological survey, using 1 km squares as sampling units.
- 1978: 32 Land Classes derived from environmental attributes; centre squares of a 15x15 km grid classified (1228 squares originally; 6039 km2 in surrounding squares included); eight samples per class (256 total) for national estimates.
- 1984: Sampling expanded to 12 km squares per class (384 total); aim to improve representation, though allocation did not optimally reflect class sizes.
- 1990: Class revised to cover all GB squares with data surrogates for climatic, geological, and physiographic factors; 508 squares surveyed; introduced Land Cover Map linkage.
- 1998: Further development to enable Scotland-only reporting; number of Land Classes increased (to about 40) with broader coverage.
- 2000: CS2000 introduced country-specific estimates (England with Wales and Scotland) using sub-divided classes and aggregated “rump” classes as needed; added 19 extra squares to improve representation; included upland habitat considerations.
- 2007: Wales-only reporting requirements driven devolution led to additional Wales-specific class sub-divisions (five new Wales classes), increasing strata to 45; 43 extra Welsh squares added; some English classes slightly reduced in sampling to maintain feasibility.

## Sampling Framework Across CS Surveys
- 1978 (Initial Survey): 256 squares surveyed (8 per Land Class); national estimates computed from mean habitat area per square times land-class area; used 32 classes.
- 1984 (Second Survey): 384 squares surveyed (12 per class); continued use of 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares/Third Survey): Land Classification updated to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed; included repeat vegetation data and habitat mapping; national estimates aligned with the new comprehensive classification.
- 2000 (CS2000): Expanded framework to support separate country estimates; created country-unit versions of classes (England with Wales and Scotland); added 19 new squares; some classes subdivided or aggregated to ensure representation; upland habitat module introduced to improve upland estimates.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-focused adjustments to address Wales-only reporting needs; introduced 5 new Welsh sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); increased total strata to 45; added 43 Welsh squares; some English classes reduced to 4 squares but deemed acceptable for precision; maps and Tables summarize these distributions.

## Country-specific Reporting and Upland Module
- Wales and Scotland reporting requirements driven revisions to Land Classification and sampling; Wales received dedicated Welsh-class subdivisions and increased sampling to ensure robust Wales-only estimates.
- An uplands module added in CS2000/CS2007 to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales, providing country-based estimates with better precision.

## Estimation Method and Data Governance
- National estimates are produced by combining class-level statistics: mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
- Changes in the Land Classification across surveys affect cross-survey comparability; the 2006 scoping study notes that switching classifications can impact GB-level estimates, so consistency strategies favor using the latest, country-specific classifications for within-survey estimates while allowing cross-survey interpretation with caution.
- Summary tables (e.g., Table 2, Table 3) document the number of squares per class and per survey, illustrating how sampling intensity and class representation evolved.
- The accompanying maps (Figures 4–7) show revised Land Class distributions and sample-square allocations for England, Wales, and Scotland, reflecting country-specific and Welsh sub-classifications.
- Appendix i provides a brief historical overview of the development of the ITE Land Classification.

## Data Assets and Practical Implications for Data Leaders
- The strategy creates a long-running, structured data series linking land classes, sample squares, and habitat estimates across multiple decades.
- Key data considerations:
  - Data governance: maintaining consistency and documenting changes in classifications to preserve comparability.
  - Metadata and discoverability: land-class maps and sample-square inventories are central assets (referenced figures and tables).
  - User needs: country-specific reporting requirements (England, Wales, Scotland) drive sub-classifications and sampling allocations.
  - Collaboration and standards: alignment with policy and environmental reporting across devolved administrations; potential need for harmonized data standards when integrating time-series data.
