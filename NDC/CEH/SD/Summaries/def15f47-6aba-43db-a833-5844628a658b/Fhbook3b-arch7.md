# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Establishes guidelines for CS2000 sampling across Great Britain for soil, Calluna vegetation, and freshwater biota.
  - Aims to create a national, spatially referenced data set; some work is conducted by the Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) and ITE Merlewood.
  - Supports baseline soil quality assessment and broader ecological monitoring.

- Sampling types and objectives
  - Soil sampling: five replicate soil samples per CS2000 square (X-plot) for chemistry, soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status.
  - Calluna sampling: collection of current year’s Calluna vulgaris growth to study foliar nitrogen related to nitrogen deposition.
  - Freshwater sampling: conducted by IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 field teams.

- Sampling design and logistics
  - Sampling conducted in 1 km squares; five soil sampling locations per square center plot (X-plot).
  - Soil cores collected using three pipes (one long black, two short white) per centre plot in each X-plot.
  - National coordination with ITE Merlewood for processing and storage of soil samples.

- Detailed soil sampling procedure
  - Location: centre plot (2 x 2 m) within each X-plot; identify the north corner and a point 15 cm north.
  - First (long black) core: depth > 5 cm, upright insertion, press aluminium plate flush, extract soil, seal, label, and post in a labelled bag.
  - Second and third (white) cores: 15 cm east and 15 cm west of the first point; perform similar insertion, sealing, labeling, and bagging.
  - Envelopes are prepared with corresponding square and X-plot numbers; send the two white pipes immediately; store the black core in the car until collection.
  - Repeat for all centre plots across all squares; total of five soil sampling locations per square.
  - Samples are posted to ITE Merlewood promptly, with receipts for postage claims where applicable.
  - Quick handling is essential due to short shelf-life for some samples.

- Calluna sampling (foliar nitrogen)
  - Collect within every square where Calluna vulgaris occurs, from current year’s growth (CYG).
  - Obtain 30–50 g fresh weight of CYG shoots from multiple Calluna plants; seal and label bags clearly.
  - If very wet, air-dry briefly before sealing; send via post or arrange despatch from an ITE station.

- Freshwater sampling
  - Conducted by accredited IFE personnel in coordination with CS2000 teams; schedule arrangements managed with coordinators.

- Photography protocol
  - Each team has a camera and limited film; photograph every vegetation plot to capture general appearance and landmark context.
  - Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and within view; plot and square numbers must be visible on a board at the plot edge.
  - Composition: plot should occupy a substantial portion of the frame; minimize excessive sky; reference features should be clear for future visits.

- Procedures after survey
  - Daily data sheet checks to ensure no features are omitted.
  - Transcribing data to new maps/forms is discouraged; only necessary in cases of map damage or spoiling.
  - FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE Stations as soon as possible.

- GPS data collection (Annex 1)
  - Battery power and satellite checks before logging; ensure at least four satellites and PDOP below 6 for reliable fixes.
  - Two logging modes: stationary position (for plots) and moving feature logging (for boundaries in upland areas).
  - Unique file naming: square number plus plot/feature ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4); feature codes for new features (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
  - Data rate and attribute selection guided by a predefined attribute list; plot IDs and features selected via an attribute reference sheet.
  - Logging status and timing displayed; stop logging when sufficient data are collected.
  - Battery charging procedures and tips for improving GPS reception in obstructed sites (e.g., elevating the external antenna).
  - Guidance on using the Magellan keypad and ensuring clear sky views for optimal signal reception.
  - The attribute reference list enables quick input of plot/feature IDs to streamline data capture.

- Data management and integration implications for GIS
  - Data are tied to squares (X-plots and centre plots) with explicit parcel/plot identifiers and time-stamped sampling events.
  - Standardized sampling protocols, labeling, and GPS data conventions facilitate integration into GIS workflows and time-series analyses.
  - Primary outputs include soil chemistry, soil fauna, microbiological status, Calluna foliar nitrogen, freshwater data, photos, and GPS-derived locations for plots and features.
  - Emphasis on accurate relocation, plot marking, and linkage of new features to square and plot identifiers for longitudinal studies.
