## Sampling and context

- Soil samples collected as part of the Countryside Survey 1998/1999
- Up to 256 1km squares across Great Britain
- Soil samples described and analyzed following CS2000 Field Survey Handbook

## Laboratory methods

- Sample preparation:
  - Air dried and sieved to <2 mm
  - Sub-sampled (coning and quartering) for ball milling (non-metallic agate mill)
- Digestion and analysis:
  - Total metal concentrations determined after aqua regia digestion under reflux (3 g soil in acid, diluted to 100 ml)
  - Analysis by ICP-OES (JY38plus) with high power and low flow
  - Some samples (12 measurements) below detection limit analyzed by EA NLS laboratory using ICP-MS
  - Calibration with 12.5% HNO3 solutions adjusted to soil matrix using Ca, Mg, Fe, Al
- Batch organization:
  - 20 samples per batch + 2 QC + 2 blanks
  - Reflux aqua-regia digestion performed in groups of 12 (10 samples + 1 QC + 1 blank)

## Quality control and data integrity

- Certified Reference Materials and samples from international soil exchange schemes analyzed to verify methods
- Methods aligned with: Determination of Metals in Soils, sediments, and sewage sludge and plants by hydrochloric-nitric acid digestion (Methods for the Examination of Waters and Associated Materials, 1986 HMSO)
- Results traceable to Certified Reference Materials (NBS Estuarine Sediment 1646; BCR Lake Sediment No 280)
- With each batch of 25 samples: 2 internal reference samples, blanks, and a random duplicate analyzed

## How this aligns with Analysts Monitoring the Environment

- Provides standardized, quality-controlled soil metal concentration data for Great Britain from 1998/1999
- Uses established laboratory methods with traceable QA/QC, enabling reliable temporal and spatial analyses
- Includes land classification and geographic descriptors to support ecosystem health assessments
- Requires proper acknowledgment and offers links to broader Countryside Survey resources for data integration and reuse
- Supports data interoperability and potential combination with other environmental datasets to enhance value and accessibility of underlying data
