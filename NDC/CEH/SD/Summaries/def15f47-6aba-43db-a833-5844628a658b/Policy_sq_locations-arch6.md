# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. Applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential

- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, both essential for future surveys, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports scientific integrity and informed environmental policy; requests are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## When locations may be released and precision levels

- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence to indicate approximate square locations for predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references are only released in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external pre-processing analysis by CEH is preferred to avoid releasing precise locations.
- Spatial data from within squares (maps of habitats, linear features) could indirectly identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.
- License terms prohibit using location data to plan visits or to check landowner compliance; licensees must not attempt to derive precise square locations from data.

## Specific conditions of release

- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and a written destruction confirmation provided at project end.
- No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP when requested.
- Four-digit releases have license terms similar to six-digit but less stringent IP confidentiality requirements; five-note clause prohibits attempts to deduce exact square locations.

## Responsibilities

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; licences require sign-off by a senior authorized official from the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI/Environmental Regulations procedures and supports decision rationale.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS partner use, CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within timeframes; other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
