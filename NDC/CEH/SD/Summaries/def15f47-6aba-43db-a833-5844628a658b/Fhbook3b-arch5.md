# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Data governance, standards, and metadata
- Establishes standardized data collection across field activities (FABs, plots, maps, codes) to ensure data interoperability and reproducibility.
- Emphasizes data lineage and traceability, including parcel IDs, change events, and reason codes for modifications.
- Requires a clear data dictionary linking CS1990 and CS2000 codes to current standards; metadata for FABs, maps, and plots (coordinates, dates, surveyors, equipment).
- Documents how data move between maps (e.g., BAP vs. theme maps) and how mosaics and partial feature changes are handled.

## Data capture, structure, and documentation
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) as the central recording tool, encompassing:
  - Core data: square series, ownership, physiography, agriculture/vegetation, forestry, boundaries, buildings/communications, recreation.
  - Primary and secondary codes for land cover, vegetation, and features; cross-reference codes for mosaics and complex descriptions.
  - Ownership, landowner interactions, permission status, and notes on recent changes or new features with parcel updates.
- Mapping outputs and data recording forms linked to Broad Habitats, with explicit workflows for changes, new parcels, and extent adjustments.
- Data structures and annexes document boundaries, curtilages, and habitat classifications to support reproducibility and data lineage.

## Data collection procedures and quality control
- Standardized methods across observers to minimize observer variability; detailed guidance to document deviations.
- End-of-day data checks to ensure no omissions; if needed, data may be transposed onto fresh maps only as a last resort.
- Documented procedures for relocating plots (e.g., using metal plates, plan references, GPS) to maintain long-term comparability.
- Defined plotting procedures (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S/W, R/V plots) with precise layouts, recording rules, and leave-behind markers for repeatability.

## Data provenance, change tracking, and lineage
- Explicit tracking of feature changes via New Parcel Numbers and linkage to CS1990 parcel codes.
- Guidance on re-numbering features, creating new rows for significant changes, handling mosaics, and managing splits/merges within a square.
- Monitoring data integrity when features move between maps (e.g., transitioning to BAP maps) and addressing montane habitats that may require de novo mapping.

## GPS, location data, and digital positioning
- Annex 1 provides standardized GPS data collection and relocation methodologies for plots, enhancing repeatability in upland areas.
- File naming conventions require square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to ensure traceability of spatial data.
- Steps cover satellite checks, PDOP considerations (aim for PDOP < 6 for better accuracy), stationary vs. moving logging, and handling of antenna issues.
- Documentation of GPS attributes and feature names, with an attribute reference to quickly select plot IDs.

## Photography and documentation for reuse
- Cameras provided to capture vegetation plots in context, with photographs tied to square/plot numbers and reference features.
- Photos should clearly show the plot position relative to landmarks, and plotting boards must be visible to aid future re-entry.
- Photographs support metadata, provenance, and long-term comparability across survey years.

## Sampling procedures and data integration
- Sampling types include soil, Calluna vegetation, and freshwater biota; soil and Calluna sampling performed by CS2000 field staff, freshwater sampling by IFE staff.
- Soil sampling in each X-plot includes five replicates with specific pipe-based procedures, strict labeling, packaging, and timely despatch to ITE Merlewood.
- Calluna sampling within 1 km squares follows a standardized protocol for CYG shoots, with careful labeling and despatch.
- Freshwater sampling coordinated with IFE to align with field activities and ensure integration with landscape data.

## Outputs, alignment, and governance for reuse
- Outputs are aligned with biodiversity frameworks (Broad Habitats) to support national biodiversity action plans and related directives.
- Structured translation/mapping from CS1990 to BAP categories; specialized maps (ponds, hydrological features) integrated as annexes.
- Emphasis on documentation, metadata, and provenance to enable discovery, reuse, and future updates by data stewards.

## Practical guidance for Data Stewards
- Maintain a robust data dictionary linking historical CS1990 codes to CS2000 and international standards where applicable.
- Capture and preserve data lineage by recording parcel IDs, change events, and reasons for modifications.
- Enforce metadata standards for FABs, maps, and plots (coordinates, dates, personnel, equipment).
- Implement quality control checks to minimize observer variation and document methodological deviations.
- Plan for ongoing updates and re-surveys, using CS2000 as a baseline for future monitoring and ensuring data provenance across years.
