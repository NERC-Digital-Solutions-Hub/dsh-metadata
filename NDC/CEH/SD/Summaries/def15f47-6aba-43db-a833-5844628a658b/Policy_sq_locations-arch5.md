# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: To maximise CS spatial data utility for public interest while minimising risks to survey integrity and landowner goodwill; applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within squares; other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for ongoing surveys, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Release requests are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released

- Allowed uses: determine whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing each square.
- Six-digit grid references: only in very exceptional circumstances; require demonstrating that associated IP data/models carry equal or higher confidentiality/protection than CS data; external release requires CEH processing avoidance if possible.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, etc.): treated as potentially identifying and released under the same exceptional circumstances as six-digit references.
- Processing preference: for many external requests, pre-processing analysis should be done by CEH to avoid releasing exact locations.

## Specific conditions of release

- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and for specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or images may be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality threshold of six-digit releases; still disallow attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities

- CEH, on behalf of NERC and the CS partners, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by a senior official of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Internal data access needs: CEH should provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Recommendation to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, depending on the case.

## Implications for Data Stewards

- Governance: manage access controls, licensing, and secure storage; ensure licences are time-bound and tracked.
- Compliance: ensure releases align with FOI/EIR policies and JCOP-equivalent standards for licensees.
- Transparency and accountability: monitor requests, approvals, and destruction confirmations; provide annual reporting.
- Operational workflow: collaborate with CEH for pre-processing analyses to minimize unnecessary release of precise locations.
- Stakeholder coordination: engage with CS partners and CEH early to define requirements and permissible use.
