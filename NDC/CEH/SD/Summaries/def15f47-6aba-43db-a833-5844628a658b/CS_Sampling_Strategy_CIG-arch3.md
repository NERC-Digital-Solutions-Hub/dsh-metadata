# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the sampling framework and land classification evolution underlying Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
  - Aims to provide representative, change-detecting measures of habitat and land-use characteristics to inform policy and monitoring.
  - Highlights linkage between the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework, and the importance of comparability over time.

- Core concepts and methodology
  - ITE Land Classification: stratified stratification of Great Britain into land classes based on environmental attributes; used to ensure representative sampling.
  - Stratified random sampling: samples drawn from land classes to avoid bias and ensure coverage of variability.
  - Sampling unit: 1 km2 squares; centres of a 15 x 15 km grid used in early stages; surrounding squares also allocated to classes.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA): multivariate method used to form initial Land Classes; later evolved classifications retained similar environmental summaries.
  - National estimates: derived by combining mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the overall area of each class.

- Evolution of the sampling framework by survey year
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and first field survey)
    - 1228 centre 1 km squares classified; 4 surrounding squares assigned per centre (total 6039 km2 classified).
    - 256 sample squares (8 per Land Class) surveyed; field focus on vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
    - National habitat estimates calculated from class-area proportions and mean habitat area per square.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per Land Class (total 384 squares); eight additional squares per class previously visited.
    - National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification framework.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification and third field survey)
    - Land Classification extended to cover every GB square; satellite-derived Land Cover Map linked to CS1990.
    - 508 squares surveyed; repeat vegetation quadrats and full feature dataset from 1984.
    - National estimates recalculated under the revised all-squares classification; results published in 1993.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification and fourth field survey)
    - Classification updated to allow separate Scottish reporting; total Land Classes increased to 40.
    - 569 squares surveyed in the fourth survey; national reporting aligned with the revised framework.
  - 2000 (Countryside Survey CS2000; fifth field survey)
    - Response to policy needs to derive separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland).
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata expanded to 40 with sub-division and aggregation to maintain representation.
    - 19 additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland habitat module added (30 squares) to improve upland estimates.
    - Wales gains more intensive sampling (64 squares in Wales); separate country reporting becomes feasible.
  - 2007 (Countryside Survey CS2007; adjustments for Wales-only reporting)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements drive further Welsh-class subdivisions (five new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and a total of 45 strata.
    - Additional Wales squares (43) to ensure representation in all Welsh classes; some English classes reduced to four squares due to precision considerations.
    - Updated sampling maps (England-Wales and Scotland) and a Wales-focused sampling plan to meet policy and governance needs.

- Country-scale and reporting considerations
  - Separate country estimates (England with Wales vs. Scotland) required adjustments to the Land Classification and sampling approach.
  - Class sub-division and aggregation used to maintain adequate representation across countries; additional squares allocated to ensure robust estimates per country unit.
  - Wales-specific adjustments and upland module enhancements reflect policy and governance needs for country-level habitat status reporting.

- Data outputs, governance, and consistency notes
  - Results and methodologies repeatedly published in Countryside Survey reports (1990, 2000, 2007 updates and associated companion analyses).
  - Note on consistency: changing Land Classification for national estimates affects comparability; the preferred approach is to use the latest classification for country estimates while acknowledging cross-survey consistency challenges.
  - The document emphasizes the balance between representativeness, data quality, and policy-relevant reporting across time and across UK countries.
