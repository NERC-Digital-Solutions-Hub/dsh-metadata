# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Describes the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey fieldwork up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification, a stratified system designed to represent Britain’s ecological variation.
  - Emphasises representativeness, comparability across time, and integration with policy-relevant habitat/status estimates.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified random sampling to avoid bias and ensure national representativeness.
  - ITE Land Classification (initially 32 classes) used to stratify the landscape by environmental attributes.
  - Quadrats/squares: field sampling units are 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid in early work; later expanded).
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to group environmental attributes into land classes that reflect ecological variation.

- Key developments by survey year
  - 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
    - 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes; 1,228 center squares classified (plus 4 surrounding squares per centre).
    - Final classified set: 6,039 km² across GB.
    - Sampling: eight squares per land class; total of 256 squares surveyed.
    - National estimates: mean habitat area per square in each class multiplied by land-class area.
  - 1984 – Second GB survey
    - Sampling framework retained; increased to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
    - Results published in landscape-change-focused outputs.
  - 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
    - Land Classification updated to cover all GB squares (All Squares approach); 508 squares surveyed.
    - Collected features recorded in 1984 plus repeat vegetation quadrats; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
    - Resulted in a 1990 Land Classification; national estimates still derived from this framework.
  - 1998/2000 – Revisions to support broader reporting
    - Land Classification expanded to improve regional/local estimations; 40 classes introduced.
    - Need for separate country-level estimates (England with Wales, Scotland, and later separate upland/Wales focus) led to changes in sampling.
    - Separate-country sampling framework introduced: 40 strata, with additional squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; Isle of Man adjustments.
    - Upland habitat module added (CS2000) to improve upland estimates with 30 additional squares in upland/marginal classes.
  - 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 adjustments
    - Wales-only reporting requirements driven by devolved policy needs.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (England-Wales and Scotland).
    - Five new country-unit classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Wales received 43 extra squares (minimum six per Welsh class); England not granted extra Welsh-equivalent squares in some classes.
    - England classes 5e and 15e left with four squares each; precision deemed acceptably small per scoping studies.
    - Revised land-class maps published for England-with-Wales and Scotland; Wales became the most intensively sampled country unit.

- Country-specific estimates and sampling design
  - Distinct country units (England & Wales, Scotland) used for national estimates to improve policy relevance.
  - Land Classes subdivided by country unit; aggregation used where a class had too few squares within a country.
  - Additional squares allocated to maintain representation across new/altered classes.
  - Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with England samples in some configurations.

- Upland and additional modules
  - CS2000 introduced an upland habitat module to improve accuracy for upland regions in England and Wales.
  - 30 upland squares added to target habitats in upland/marginal zones.

- Outputs and references
  - Tables and figures ( referenced in the document ) illustrate the distribution of sample squares across land classes and countries.
  - Note on national estimates: switching to a new Land Classification affects cross-survey consistency; for a given survey, the latest classification is preferred, while older classifications may be used for cross-survey comparability.

- Practical implications for GIS and data products
  - The framework provides map-based strata (land classes) and explicit sampling densities by class and country, enabling spatially explicit estimates.
  - Data products can be created by linking square-level observations to the 32–45 (and country-unit) land classes, with adjustments for upland modules.
  - The evolution highlights the balance between data availability, resolution, and the need for country-specific reporting in a devolved policy environment.
