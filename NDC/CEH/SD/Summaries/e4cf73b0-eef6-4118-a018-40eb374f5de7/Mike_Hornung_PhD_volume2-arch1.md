# C. 2. Loss on ignition and organic carbon

- Purpose and general notes
  - Loss on ignition (LOI) estimates organic matter and includes water loss from clays, carbon oxidation, and, in calcareous soils, CO2 from carbonate breakdown.
  - At 375°C (the temperature used here), carbonate loss is negligible due to low calcium carbonate content; a 10% correction is commonly subtracted from LOI to account for clay-water loss.
  - Organic carbon (OC) values are also reported and used to compute carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios; LOI-based OC estimates carry several potential errors (carbonate breakdown, elemental carbon, chlorides/manganese oxidation, etc.).
  - LOI is used for routine work to save time; for precise OC values, wet or dry combustion is preferable.
  - Two main error sources: carbonates (minimal at this temperature) and burning off of elemental carbon; other method-specific errors (Walkley-Black limitations) also propagate.

- LOI patterns by soil type and horizon (mineral horizons)
  - Rendzinas and brown rankers: highest LOI values (15–25%) in mineral horizons; C horizons in brown rankers show marl-like decreases; rendzinas maintain relatively constant LOI with depth.
  - Brown calcareous soils: surface horizons 10–15% LOI; little variation with depth; deeper horizons show modest decreases.
  - Acid brown earths and brown podzolic soils: generally show decreases in LOI down the profile; typical values lower than calcareous soils.
  - Peaty gleys and peaty gleyed podzols: highly variable LOI in mineral horizons (2–14%), with most values between 3–8%; increases with depth observed in some peaty podzols.
  - Humus iron podzols: occasional increases in LOI in humic B horizons, possibly due to translocation of organic matter.

- Specific notes for interpretation
  - In peaty gleyed podzols, increases in LOI with depth sometimes accompany increases in nitrogen, suggesting organic-matter translocation.
  - LOI values are particularly informative when compared with OC and C:N ratios to assess humus type and degree of decomposition.

- c. 3. Soil reaction
  - pH measurement standard: soil/water suspension with a 1:2.5 ratio; timing and water content affect apparent pH; some labs use CaCl2 (M/100) to approximate field conditions, typically yielding values 0.5–1.0 units lower than water.
  - pH scale used: Strongly acid < 4.5; moderately acid 4.5–5.5; slightly acid 5.5–6.5; neutral 6.5–7.5.
  - Key patterns
    - Calcareous soils (rendzinas, brown calcareous soils) tend to be neutral; calcareous subsoils may also be neutral.
    - Non-calcareous soils show increasing pH with depth; surface horizons often more acidic.
    - Acid brown earths and brown podzolic soils: surface horizons strongly acid to moderately acid, with gradual neutralization at depth.
    - Peaty gleys, peaty gleyed podzols, and humus iron podzols: strongly acidic overall, though some deep horizons may approach moderate acidity.

- c. 4. Nitrogen
  - Nitrogen analyzed by Kjeldahl method; results reflect total nitrogen (less fluctuation than inorganic N).
  - Typical range: 2.59% down to 0.03% across profiles; highest values in surface horizons of calcareous soils and acid brown earths.
  - General trend: N declines with depth in most profiles; two peaty gleyed podzols show depth-related increases in N, paralleling increases in organic matter from translocation.
  - Carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios
    - Mull humus: low C:N (3–9) indicating well-decomposed residues.
    - Moder and mor humus: higher C:N (roughly 4–15), indicating less decomposed organic matter.
    - Some profiles show anomalously low C:N in surface horizons of rendzinas and brown calcareous soils, prompting further study.

- c. 5. Exchangeable cations and base saturation
  - Method: ammonium acetate extraction; cations measured include Ca, Mg, K, Na.
  - Calcium (Ca) dominant in most soils; calcareous soils show the highest Ca values; non-calcareous soils show lower Ca, with depth increasing Ca in some limestone-overlain profiles.
  - Magnesium (Mg): ranges from very low to moderate; calcareous soils tend to higher Mg; patterns often lack a simple sub-group trend, but depth-over-limestone profiles may show increasing Mg.
  - Sodium (Na): generally low to moderate; two peaty gleys show sodium-dominated horizons.
  - Potassium (K): range from very low to high, but many horizons show uniformly low to moderate values; a notable high value (0.84 me/100 g) in a surface horizon of a brown ranker with high clay (illite-dominated) content.
  - Overall, exchangeable cation patterns are strongly influenced by parent material (calcareous vs non-calcareous) and by horizon-specific processes (podzolisation, illitization).

- c. 6. Percentage base saturation
  - Base saturation indicates soil acidity and leaching history.
  - Calcareous soils show the highest base saturations: rendzinas 60–100%; brown calcareous soils 31–90%.
  - Other sub-groups typically show lower base saturation, with podzols often among the lowest (sometimes 5–15% in B horizons of peaty podzols and humus podzols).
  - Depth trends: most soils exhibit increasing base saturation with depth; depth-over-limestone cases show the most marked increases.

- c. 7. Total chemical analysis
  - Purpose: assess plant nutrients and potential elemental excess; components can help distinguish bedrock influence from soil formation processes.
  - Methods: X-ray fluorescence (XRF) with briquettes or glass beads (fusion); standards are challenging; duplicates indicate reproducibility, though cross-method accuracy is tentative.
  - Major findings
    - Total Ca typically 0.05–1.72% (calcareous soils highest); two peaty gleys have very low Ca.
    - Total Mg 0.03–2.2%, with highest values in rendzina and soils over chlorite-rich lithology.
    - Na generally low to moderate; some horizons near 0.84% in calcareous or illite-rich contexts.
    - K generally low to moderate; a single horizon with high K (0.84%) in a clay-rich acidic brown earth with high illite content.
    - Variation largely reflects parent material; calcareous soils tend to have higher total base contents.
  - Notable high-Pb and Zn values observed in a Rough Sike limestone site, attributed to local vein geology.

- c. 8. Trace elements
  - Trace elements measured to aid in botanical studies and to help identify sedentary soils over limestone versus drift-derived soils.
  - Strontium (Sr): higher in sedentary soils over limestone; rubidium (Rb) and zirconium (Zr) higher in drift-derived materials.
  - Lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn): some soils over limestone show very high Pb (1300–3900 ppm) and Zn (1200–2900 ppm), reflecting mineralization in limestone.
  - Overall interpretation is constrained; some results suggest sedentary origin for rendzinas and kaolin-rich clays, while others indicate drift-derived materials.

- c. 9. Clay mineralogy
  - Clay assemblages largely inherited from parent material; some in-situ formation possible but unlikely under current Pennine climate.
  - Drift (glacial) soils: illite-dominated clays (reflects Carboniferous shale inlet in drift).
  - Rendzinas over Scar Limestone: kaolinite-dominated clays (from limestone insoluble residues).
  - Over Tyne Bottom Limestone: chlorite-dominated clays.
  - Humus iron podzols on Great Dun Fell: kaolinite-dominated clays, indicating sedimentary sources from Namurian strata.
  - Western escarpment drift: illite-dominated; base-of-escarpment soils over limestone show kaolin-rich clays, possibly seabed-derived kaolin near exposures of kaolin-rich bedrock.
  - Conclusion: clay mineralogy supports distinctions between sedentary bedrock-derived soils and drift-derived soils.

- c. 10. Calcium carbonate
  - Soils containing free CaCO3 grouped as calcareous; carbonate analyses help classification and reveal carbonate levels.
  - Carbonates are present at low levels: rendzinas 1–3%; brown calcareous soils 0.5–1.0% near the surface and 1.0–1.5% closer to bedrock interfaces.
  - Implication: carbonate content is low, indicating strong leaching under the climate; carbonate presence is greatest near bedrock contact.

- c. 11. Extractable iron
  - Readily extractable iron represents the active pool mobilized during podzolisation.
  - In brown earths: fairly constant down the profile.
  - In podzols: minimum in A2 horizon, maximum in B horizon, then decreasing in C.
  - Interpretation challenges: extractable iron in B horizon may reflect eluviation from A2 or in-situ formation; differences across parent materials complicate cross-soil comparisons.
  - Overall: patterns support iron movement in podzolic soils and correlate with horizon translocation.

- c. 12. Heavy mineral analyses
  - Focus on fine sand/silt fractions to infer parent material signatures.
  - Drift materials: illite-rich clays dominate (linked to drift-derived substrates).
  - Rendzinas can contain limited fluorite/zircon, potentially reflecting limestone insoluble residue.
  - Many soils show diverse heavy mineral suites, indicating non-uniform origins; the method helps differentiate sedentary from drift origins when used with other evidence.

- Additional context and scope
  - The document uses these analytical results to interpret soil genesis on Moor House, relating soil properties to bedrock type (limestone, drift), mantle thickness, drainage, and microtopography.
  - The data are intended for synthesis with field observations (e.g., horizon development, podzolisation, vascular plant distributions) to infer evolutionary sequences and the influence of climate, hydrology, and substrate.

- Methodological notes and future work
  - Emphasizes the need for robust standards in total chemical analyses (especially XRF) and cross-lab calibration.
  - Suggests that dating of detrital inputs, deeper clay-mineral analyses, and enhanced hydrological understanding would help clarify horizon formation histories (A2–B transitions, pan formation) and the role of bedrock versus mantle in soil evolution.
