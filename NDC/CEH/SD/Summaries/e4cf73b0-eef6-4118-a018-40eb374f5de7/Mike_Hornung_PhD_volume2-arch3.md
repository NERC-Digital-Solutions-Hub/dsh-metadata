# THE MORPHOLOGY, MINERALOGY AND GENESIS OF SOME SOILS ON THE MOOR HOUSE NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE

- Overview for monitoring frameworks
  - The document provides a comprehensive suite of soil properties (pH, nitrogen, exchangeable cations, total chemical content, trace elements, clay minerals, carbonate, iron, and heavy minerals) across diverse soil types in Moor House.
  - It links pedogenesis (podzolisation, gleying, humus forms) to soil chemistry and mineralogy, offering indicators for tracking soil evolution and health over time.
  - Findings are framed to inform classification, interpretation of soil processes, and potential policy-relevant monitoring indicators.

## Key Measurements, Methods and Interpretive Signals

- Soil reaction (pH)
  - pH determined electrometrically from soil–water suspensions; 1:2.5 soil:water ratio; some labs use M/100 CaCl2 to approximate field soil solution and reduce error.
  - Calcareous soils tend to be neutral; non-calcareous soils are more acidic with depth; pH often increases with depth in non-calcareous soils.
  - Scale used: strongly acid (~4.5), moderately acid (4.5–5.5), slightly acid (5.5–6.5), neutral (6.5–7.5).

- Nitrogen (total nitrogen)
  - Kjeldahl method used for total nitrogen due to rapid inorganic fluctuations.
  - Total N varies from 2.59% to 0.03%; highest in calcareous surface horizons and acid brown earths; generally decreases with depth, with some peaty podzols showing depth-related increases linked to organic translocation.
  - Carbon–nitrogen ratios indicate humus type (mull vs moder vs mor); observed values generally low but variable, with peat soils showing distinct trends.

- Exchangeable cations and base saturation
  - Exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, Na determined via ammonium acetate extraction; results are comparative across laboratories using the same method.
  - Calcium typically dominates; higher Ca in calcareous soils; rendzinas often high in Ca; leaching lowers surface Ca in brown calcareous soils.
  - Magnesium ranges from very low to moderate; patterns vary with depth and over limestone; K values are generally low across profiles; Na can be notable in some peaty gleys.
  - Base saturation is highest in rendzinas and brown calcareous soils (rendzinas 60–100%; brown calcareous 31–90%), generally lower in other sub-groups; surface horizons over limestone often show leaching signatures with depth.

- Total chemical analysis (major elements)
  - Uses X-ray fluorescence (two main methods: briquetting vs fusion to glass beads); laboratories face standardization challenges.
  - Total base contents (Ca, Mg, Na, K) are generally low; calcareous soils show higher Ca; Mg and Na vary with parent material.
  - Specific notes: rendzinas over limestone can have unusually high Mg in some profiles (linked to mineral content, e.g., chlorite); some soils show very low extractable base values due to rock-derived composition.
  - Major pattern: total element contents reflect parent material and degree of leaching/podzolation.

- Trace elements
  - Measured to aid botanical studies and distinguish sedentary soils over limestone from transported drift soils.
  - Strontium tends to be higher in sedentary soils over limestone; zirconium and rubidium show site-specific patterns.
  - Notable high lead and zinc in rendzina soils over certain limestone veining, reflecting bedrock mineralization.

- Clay minerals
  - Clay mineralogy largely inherited from parent material; some in-situ formation possible but limited by climate.
  - Drift (illite-dominated) vs calcareous soils (kaolin-dominated or chlorite-dominated, depending on limestone) vs humus iron podzols (kaolin-dominated).
  - Kaolin-rich clays indicate near-site derivation; illite-dominated fraction indicates drift origin; portal evidence for sedentary vs transported materials.

- Calcium carbonate
  - Calcium carbonate analyses show small but important levels in calcareous soils; rendzinas typically 1–3%, brown calcareous soils 0.5–1% near surface and 1–1.5% toward bedrock.
  - Large soluble carbonate can influence Ca-measured exchangeable Ca.

- Extractable iron
  - Deb (1950) method used; extractable iron patterns often show maxima in B horizons for podzols, with A2 sometimes lower.
  - Movement of iron and its association with clay translocation and podzolisation phases; interpret with caution due to exchangeable iron complexities.

- Heavy minerals
  - Heavy mineral analyses (on fine sand/silt) differentiate sedentary limestone-insoluble-residue signatures from drift-derived signatures.
  - Rendzinas may be dominated by fluorite and zircon indicative of insoluble limestone residue; most soils show more diverse suites consistent with drift-derived materials.

## Pedogenesis, Landscape Context and Monitoring Relevance

- Parent materials and landscape controls
  - Soils reflect a complex interaction of locally derived superficial cover with Carboniferous rocks (Whin Sill, Great and Melmerby Scar Limestone) and limestone features that modify drainage and soil development.
  - Clay-mineralogy, trace elements, and heavy-mineral suites support distinguishing sedentary (nearby bedrock-derived) vs transported/drift-derived soils.
- Evolutionary implications for monitoring
  - Pedogenic processes (podzolisation, gleying, humus form) are tied to chemistry (pH, base saturation, Fe extractability) and mineralogy (clay types, CaCO3).
  - Monitoring indicators should track horizon development, pH and base saturation shifts, and humus forms across altitude and slope to understand soil responses to climate and hydrology.

## Monitoring Framework Implications and Recommendations

- Standardized soil typology
  - Develop a typology linked to parent material, depth of superficial cover, and slope to support consistent monitoring and policy reporting.
- Long-term plots and horizon tracking
  - Establish permanent plots to observe horizon development, peat dynamics, and vegetation–soil feedbacks, particularly on limestone features and peat-rich slopes.
- Data integration and governance
  - Integrate soil data with topographic and vegetation classifications to inform land management and climate resilience planning.
  - Standardize laboratory methods and metadata (pH, base saturation, cation exchange capacity, clay minerals) to enable cross-site comparisons and policy-relevant reporting.
- Indicators and interpretation
  - Use mineral–organic boundary interactions (A1/A2, A2G, BG, CG horizons) and trends in pH, base saturation, and Fe extractability as indicators of pedogenic progression and hydrological control.
- Data quality and standards
  - Address challenges with standards for total and extractable analyses; consider pre-ignition and artificial standards to improve cross-lab comparability; treat total analyses as guides when comparing across sites.
- Practical data gaps to address
  - Clarify how different parent materials influence baseline chemistry; better link clay mineralogy to pedogenic stage; expand trace-element baselines where limestone veining occurs.

## Data Gaps and Considerations for Policy Appraisal

- Uncertainties in how varying parent materials and microclimates drive pedogenic pathways across Moor House.
- Need for clearer links between specific chemical/mineral indicators and defined monitoring targets (e.g., podzol progression, peat dynamics, or hydrological shifts).
- Challenges of instrument standardization and the interpretation of total vs extractable elements across soils with different bedrock influences.
