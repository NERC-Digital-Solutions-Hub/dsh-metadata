# MOOR HOUSE National Nature Reserve

- A soil survey detailing pH, nitrogen, exchangeable cations, total chemical composition, trace elements, clay mineralogy, calcium carbonate, extractable iron, and heavy minerals across calcareous and non-calcareous soils on Carboniferous bedrock and surrounding drift.
- Data link soil morphology to bedrock, superficial cover, drainage, and landscape features; emphasize provenance (sedentary vs drift) and implications for soil classification and genesis.

## c. 3. Soil reaction (pH)

- Soil pH measured electrometrically in soil/water suspensions; 1:2.5 soil:water ratio used (1930 standard), with some laboratories using 0.5 M CaCl2 to better reflect field conditions (pH typically 0.5–1.0 units lower in CaCl2).
- pH interpretation scale: Strongly acid (~4.5), Moderately acid (4.5–5.5), Slightly acid (5.5–6.5), Neutral (6.5–7.5).
- Calcareous soils (rendzinas, brown calcareous) tend to be neutral; surface horizons may be slightly acidic but subsoil neutral.
- Non-calcareous soils vary in acidity, generally less acidic with depth; surface horizons of acid brown earths and brown podzols can be strongly acidic; peaty gleys and related horizons are strongly acidic, with pH increasing with depth, especially over limestone.

## c. 4. Nitrogen

- Total nitrogen determined by Kjeldahl method (stable measurements with high precision).
- N contents range widely from about 0.03% to 2.59%; highest in mineral surface horizons of calcareous soils and acid brown earths.
- Most profiles show decreasing N with depth; two peaty gleyed podzols show increases at depth (likely linked to organic matter translocation and carbon content).
- Carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (C:N) indicate humus type: mull-type results with low C:N in rendzinas and brown calcareous soils; moder/mor humus suggested in many acid brown and brown podzolic soils; LOI-based assessments have limitations.

## c. 5. Exchangeable cations and base saturation

- Exchangeable cations measured with ammonium acetate; results are conventional and method-dependent but allow internal comparisons across soils.
- Calcium is the dominant exchangeable cation in most soils; substantially higher in calcareous soils and deeper horizons over limestone.
- Magnesium ranges from very low to moderate, often higher in calcareous soils; patterns vary by profile, with some increases with depth over limestone.
- Sodium and potassium vary notably; several soils show very low K values overall; two peaty gleys show sodium-dominated horizons (30 PG and 31 PG).
- Base saturation: Rendzinas and brown calcareous soils often show high base saturation (60–100% in rendzinas; 31–90% in brown calcareous soils); other sub-groups tend to lower saturations, reflecting leaching and podzolisation.
- Depth trends: base saturation generally increases with depth in soils over limestone; surface horizons in calcareous soils can be leached and lower in base saturation.

## c. 6. Percentage base saturation

- Base saturation reflects soil acidity and leaching; values and trends depend on parent material and climate.
- Calcareous soils typically maintain higher base saturation; non-calcareous soils show lower saturations with depth and across horizons.
- Podzols and peaty gleys often exhibit lower base saturation, with notable increases sometimes observed with depth in limestone-derived contexts.
- Over limestone, an overall increase in base saturation with depth is common, while surface horizons may be more leached.

## c. 7. Total chemical analysis

- Goals: quantify plant-available nutrients and mobile elements; relate to bedrock and weathering sequence; test potential use of rapid X-ray fluorescence (XRF) methods.
- Major element contents (as percent): Ca 0.05–1.72%; Mg 0.03–6.19%; Na 0–1.62%; K 0.1–4.47%.
- Calcareous soils show higher Ca and Mg totals; peaty and non-calcareous soils generally lower in base elements.
- Mg particularly high in a Rendzina profiled soil; some soils with many Whin Sill boulders show elevated Mg and other elements.
- Na and K contents vary; some horizons show unusually high K where illite-dominated clays are present.
- Limitations: results depend on sample matrix and standards; ongoing discussion about standardization and calibration for XRF methods.
- Interpretation: total contents help distinguish soils by parent material and reveal differences between sedentary limestone-derived soils and drift-derived soils.

## c. 8. Trace elements

- Trace elements used to help identify sedimentary vs sedentary soils and to understand provenance.
- Strontium often higher in sedentary soils over limestone; zirconium and rubidium vary by parent material (zirconium often higher in rendzina vs podzols; rubidium higher in rendzina where illite content is high).
- Lead and zinc can be markedly higher in some limestone-veined soils (Rough Sike area), reflecting mineral veins; otherwise, values vary with parent material and diagenesis.
- Overall, trace-element patterns complement major-element data in deciphering soil genesis and rock influence.

## c. 9. Clay mineralogy

- Clay assemblages largely inherited from parent material; minimal in-situ clay synthesis under current Pennine climate.
- Drift-derived soils commonly illite-dominated; rendzinic calcareous soils show kaolinite-dominated clays (inherited from limestone insoluble residue); Tyne Bottom limestone soils show chlorite-dominated clays.
- Humus iron podzols on summit ridges and other rendzinas show kaolin enrichment, indicating proximity to Namurian strata and sedentary origin.
- Western escarpment soils exhibit drift with illite-dominated clays; base-of-escarpment soils show kaolin-rich fractions, potentially from nearby seabed-derived sources.
- Clay mineralogy helps distinguish sedimentary vs drift origins and links to landscape position.

## c. 10. Calcium carbonate

- Soils with free CaCO3 treated as calcareous; carbonate content supports classification and helps assess carbonate status of exchangeable Ca.
- Rendzinas at the surface contain 1–3% CaCO3; brown calcareous soils have 0.5–1.0% near the surface and 1.0–1.5% closer to bedrock interface.
- Free carbonates indicate leaching and carbonate transfer within profiles; carbonate presence influences exchangeable Ca measurements.

## c. 11. Extractable iron

- Readily extractable iron represents active iron fraction mobilisable during podzolisation.
- In brown earths, extractable Fe is relatively constant down the profile; in podzols, A2 minima with maxima in B (and a decrease toward C) is common, reflecting translocation and in-situ weathering.
- Variability in extractable Fe is influenced by parent material; comparisons across soils must consider differing Fe contents in parent rocks.
- Patterns support interpretations of iron movement associated with podzolisation and soil evolution.

## c. 12. Heavy mineral analyses

- Heavy minerals in fine fractions provide provenance clues; drift and sedentary materials yield distinct suites.
- Drift (Glacial) samples show illite-dominated clay fractions (reflecting shale content in drift); rendzinas sometimes contain fluorite and zircon, suggesting limited insoluble limestone residue contributions.
- Many soils are clearly not derived from pure limestone insoluble residue; others (rendzinas) may reflect local sedimentary influence.
- Heavy mineral assemblages align with broader provenance interpretations (sedentary vs drift) and help explain variations in soil types across the landscape.
- In some limestone areas with veining, unusually high Pb and Zn (lead up to 3900 ppm, zinc up to 2900 ppm) reflect mineralization; in other soils, heavy mineral contents are lower and more uniform.

## Data integration, provenance, and data-lead implications

- Provenance signals (sedentary vs drift) are embedded in pH, base saturation, trace elements, clay mineralogy, and heavy-mineral suites.
- Clay mineralogy and total element analyses support differentiating soils over limestone vs drift materials and help interpret soil genesis in a complex carbonate-dominated landscape.
- Data governance needs (for data leaders):
  - Standardize metadata across horizons (nomenclature, depth intervals, color, structure, site context).
  - Link horizon data to bedrock type, relief, and landscape position to enable cross-site comparisons.
  - Maintain traceability of methods (pH measurement ratios, exchange extractants, LOI versus direct carbon methods, XRF standards).
  - Document provenance and potential biases (differences in sampling times, seasonal pH variation, calibration of XRF, and the influence of mineral veins on trace elements).

## Practical takeaways for data leadership

- This soil dataset exemplifies rich, multi-domain data: field morphology, chemistry, mineralogy, climate context, and geology. Value lies in cross-domain integration, provenance, and metadata.
- Priorities for data systems:
  - Implement a relational data model linking profiles, horizons, lab results, and site/geology metadata.
  - Capture method details, standards used, and calibration notes to ensure reproducibility and cross-project reuse.
  - Develop provenance trails showing whether soils are sedentary or drift-derived, and how this affects interpretation of pH, base saturation, and mineralogy.
  - Facilitate cross-disciplinary use by providing clear data provenance, documentation of limitations (e.g., LOI limitations for carbon content), and robust metadata for comparability.
