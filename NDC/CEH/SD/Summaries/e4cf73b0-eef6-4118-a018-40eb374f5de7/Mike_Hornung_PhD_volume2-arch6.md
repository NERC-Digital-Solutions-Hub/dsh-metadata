# Soil Survey of Moor House National Nature Reserve

- Comprehensive assessment of soil pH, nitrogen, exchangeable cations, base saturation, total chemical composition, trace elements, clay minerals, calcium carbonate, extractable iron, and heavy minerals across Moor House soils.
- Emphasizes the influence of parent materials (limestone features, drift, Whin Sill, sandstones) on soil chemistry and horizon development; aims to distinguish sedentary versus transported (drift) materials.
- Data intended to support pedogenesis interpretation, classification, and land-management considerations (grazing, drainage, peat conservation) alongside broader regional comparisons.

## Scope and Context
- Analyzes soil reaction (pH) and its variation with water content, time of year, and sampling method; compares pH in water vs calcium chloride extractants.
- Covers nitrogen status (total nitrogen) and humus quality (C:N ratios) to assess humification and organic matter translocation.
- Includes inorganic exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) and base saturation to evaluate soil acidity and leaching/podzolisation processes.
- Examines calcareous versus non-calcareous soils, horizon-specific chemistry, and depth-related trends.

## Methods and Measurements
- Soil pH: measured electrochemically in a soil/water suspension at a standardized soil-to-water ratio (1:2.5); sometimes in CaCl2 to better reflect field conditions.
- Nitrogen: total nitrogen via Kjeldahl method; reported as a stable indicator due to rapid inorganic nitrogen fluctuations.
- Exchangeable cations and base saturation: exchange using ammonium acetate; cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) quantified; base saturation calculated as the proportion of the cation-exchange capacity occupied by these cations.
- Total chemical analysis: major/minor elements determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF); two common XRF approaches (briquetted samples vs fused glass beads); standards and matrix effects discussed; duplicate analyses show reproducibility with caveats on standards.
- Trace elements: XRF with spike standards; elements include Sr, Pb, Zn, Zr, Ni, etc.; used for provenance (sedentary vs drift) and potential environmental insights.
- Clay minerals: qualitative analysis of the clay fraction after sedimentation, using Warshaw & Roy (1961) scheme (heating, glycol treatment, etc.); aims to infer parent material and weathering history.
- Calcium carbonate: determination to classify calcareous versus non-calcareous soils and to assess carbonate content near the soil–bedrock interface.
- Extractable iron: Deb (1950) method; interpreted with caveats about horizon translocation and mineralogy; used to assess podzolisation processes.
- Heavy minerals: analysis of fine sand/silt fractions using heavy-liquid separation (e.g., bromoform) and petrographic identification to aid parent-material attribution.

## Key Findings by Topic

- pH
  - Calcareous soils (rendzinas and brown calcareous soils) tend toward neutral in subsoil; surface horizons may be slightly acidic.
  - Non-calcareous soils (acid brown earths, brown podzolics) show varying acidity, generally increasing with leaching; peaty gleys and peaty gleyed podzols are strongly acidic, especially in surface humus layers.
  - pH generally increases with depth in non-calcareous soils, more markedly over limestone.

- Nitrogen
  - Total nitrogen ranges from 0.03% to 2.59%; surface horizons, especially in calcareous soils and acid brown earths, show higher values.
  - C:N ratios indicate mull-type humus in rendzinas and some brown calcareous soils, with moder/mor humus in many acid brown earths and podzols; peaty gleys show high organic content with contributing translocation effects.

- Exchangeable cations and base saturation
  - Calcium dominates exchangeable cations in most soils, with the highest values in calcareous soils.
  - Magnesium ranges from very low to moderate; calcareous soils tend to have higher Mg but no clear internal pattern.
  - Potassium values are generally low across soils, with rare higher values; one brown ranker shows a notably high surface K linked to high illite content.
  - Sodium ranges from very low to moderate; two peaty gleys show sodium-dominated horizons.
  - Base saturation is highest in calcareous soils (rendzinas and brown calcareous soils), with increases with depth; other sub-groups show leaching- or podzolisation-driven depletion patterns.

- Total chemical analysis
  - Overall low concentrations of Na, K, Ca, and Mg; calcareous soils show higher Ca and Mg values.
  - Rendzinas can exhibit very high Ca and Mg, with some profiles showing elevated values near bedrock interfaces.
  - Magnesium often highest in rendzina (notably profile LRI); some soils have elevated Mg due to specific mineral contents (e.g., chlorite-rich material).
  - Total analyses reveal distinct chemical signatures tied to parent material (limestone vs drift vs sandstone), including notable high Pb/Zn in limestone-vein areas.

- Trace elements
  - Sr tends to be higher in sedentary soils over limestone; rubidium and zirconium patterns reflect mineralogical differences between drift and bedrock.
  - Pb and Zn show marked variability, with exceptionally high levels in some samples near limestone veining, implying local mobility and mineralization effects.
  - Overall, trace-element results are informative but not consistently decisive for broad provenance alone; useful when integrated with other evidence.

- Clay mineralogy
  - Drift materials east of the summit ridge: illite-dominated clays (inherited from Carboniferous shales in drift).
  - Calcareous soils over Scar Limestone: kaolin-dominated clays (inherited from insoluble limestone residue).
  - Calcareous soils over Tyne Bottom Limestone: chlorite-dominated clays (inherited from limestone residue).
  - Humus iron podzols on Great Dun Fell: kaolin dominates, linked to Namurian bedrock and suggesting sedentary origin or locally derived parent material.
  - Western escarpment drift: illite-rich clays predominate, consistent with drift material; base soils near escarpment may show kaolin-rich clays from seabed residues upslope.
  - Clay mineralogy supports distinguishing sedentary versus transported materials and reflects local bedrock signatures.

- Calcium carbonate
  - Soils with detectable free calcium carbonate are classified as calcareous; carbonate contents are generally small, indicating extensive leaching.
  - Rendzinas contain 1–3% carbonate; brown calcareous soils 0.5–1.0% near the surface, increasing to 1.0–1.5% toward bedrock interface.

- Extractable iron
  - In brown earths, extractable iron is relatively constant down the profile; in podzols, maxima in B horizon with A2 minima.
  - Increases in iron often accompany increasing clay content, suggesting translocation or in situ formation effects rather than simple podzolisation alone.
  - Results support iron movement in podzolic soils and correlate with horizon development.

- Heavy minerals
  - Analysis of heavy minerals (e.g., garnet, tourmaline, rutile, zircon, fluorite) shows soils generally do not derive solely from insoluble limestone residues.
  - Some rendzinas over limestone may contain a limited suite dominated by fluorite and zircon, indicating possible local influence from insoluble limestone residues.
  - Overall, heavy-mineral assemblages aid in differentiating sedentary versus drift origins and track parent-material characteristics.

## Data Quality, Standards, and Limitations
- pH measurements can differ between water-based and calcium-chloride extractions; inter-method differences typically around 0.5–1.0 pH unit.
- Ammonium acetate is a common, reproducible extractant for exchangeable cations; results are method-dependent and best compared within the same method.
- XRF total chemical analyses depend on standardization and matrix effects; two methods (briquetting vs fusion) have trade-offs; standards availability is a limiting factor, necessitating duplicates and cross-checks.
- Extractable iron and heavy-mineral analyses rely on established methods but interpretative caveats exist regarding horizon translocation and provenance.
- In general, duplicate analyses show reproducibility; however, cross-study comparisons require careful alignment of methods and standards.

## Data Products and Use-Cases (From a Data Support Perspective)
- Horizon-level databases: organized records of horizon depths, colors, textures, pH, base saturation, and mineralogical indicators to compare shallow versus deep soil dynamics.
- Chemistry and mineralogy datasets: profiles for major/minor elements, trace elements, carbonates, and clay minerals enabling soil classification, provenance studies, and pedogenic syntheses.
- Spatial and site-level summaries: data-driven profiles linking soil types, surface types, and vegetation associations to support land management decisions (grazing, drainage planning, peat preservation) and ecological studies.
- Data-collection quality controls: standardized procedures for pH, nitrogen, cation exchange, total analyses, and mineralogical assessments; emphasis on calibration, reference samples, and inter-lab comparability.
- Research-ready datasets: detailed chemical and mineralogical measurements (including Sr, Pb, Zn, Zr, illite/kaolin/chlorite fractions, and heavy minerals) suitable for regional comparisons and pedogenetic modelling.

## Notable Endpoints and Implications
- Moor House soils illustrate a site- and material-driven spectrum from rendzina and brown calcareous soils over limestone to deeply leached acid brown earths and podzols at higher elevations, with peat-dominated systems driving distinctive gleying and horizon sequences.
- Clay mineralogy and trace-element patterns reinforce the importance of parent material and local geology in shaping soil chemistry and horizon development, including evidence for sedentary versus drift origins.
- The dataset supports frameworks for soil evolution assessment, including climaxes (peat-dominated vs podzol-dominated) and the influence of slope, limestone thickness, and surface cover on soil processes.
- Data products enable land-management planning (peat preservation, drainage, grazing) and contribute to pedological syntheses and regional soil comparisons in upland Britain.
