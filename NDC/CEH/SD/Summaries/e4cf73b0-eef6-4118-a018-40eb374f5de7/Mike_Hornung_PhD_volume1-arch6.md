# THE MORPHOLOGY, MINERALOGY AND GENESIS OF SOME SOILS ON THE MOOR HOUSE NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE

- Overview
  - Study of limestone grassland soils at Moor House focusing on how microtopography, peat presence/removal, and transported materials (glacial drift, head deposits, aeolian inputs) shape soil types.
  - Soils form a sequence influenced by three thicker limestones (Tyne Bottom, Scar, Four Fathom) with varying insoluble residues.
  - Outputs include detailed soil maps, horizon descriptions, site diagrams, and cross-sections to support ecological research, conservation, and land-use decisions.

- Data Outputs and Products
  - Site-based soil maps and grid diagrams describing microtopography (hummocks, hollows, channels) and peat boundaries.
  - Horizon-level descriptions (A, B, C horizons) with color, texture, structure, depth, root mats, boundary characteristics.
  - Profiles and cross-sections linking bedrock, superficial material, vegetation type, and hydrology.
  - Species-vegetation associations accompanying soil types (e.g., Agrosto-Festucetum, Nardetum sub-alpinum, Juncetum squarrosi sub-alpinum).
  - Datasets enabling self-serve exploration (dashboards or pivot-style summaries) and guidance for interpretation of soil-vegetation relationships.

- Methods and Evidence Used
  - Mechanical analyses of soils and insoluble residues of limestone to distinguish bedrock-derived from transported material.
  - Heavy mineral analysis of fine sand, clay fractions, quartz morphology, and clay minerals (X-ray and sieving-based work).
  - Horizon descriptions (A, B, C) with chemical indicators (pH, CaO, carbonate, base saturation) where available.
  - Field trenching (e.g., Rough Sike Trench) to study transitions between soil types and the influence of transported material.
  - Integration of vegetation, drainage, and microtopography with soil types to interpret pedogenic trajectories.

- Major Limestone Substrates and Soil Origins
  - Tyne Bottom Limestone: decalcified, impure residues; transported material contributes to soil; soils often enriched in clay and quartz from residues.
  - Scar Limestone: less insoluble residue; soils on stony loams with a mix of limestone-derived residues and transported material.
  - Four Fathom Limestone: intermediate impurity; decalcification yields gingerbread residues; soils show mixed limestone-derived and transported components.

- Major Soil Sub-groups Observed
  - Rendzina (on upstanding limestone outcrops)
  - Brown Calcareous Soil
  - Acid Brown Earth
  - Peaty Gleyed Podzol
  - Peaty Gley
  - Gleyed, Mottled, and Podzolic Variant forms (transitional/intergrades)

- Depth of Superficial Material and Soil Succession
  - Typical progression: Rendzina → Brown Calcareous Soil → Acid Brown Earth → Peaty Gleyed Podzol/Peaty Gley
  - Depth of superficial material is highly variable and often hummock-dependent; transitions can be sharp.
  - Thickness and distribution of superficial material influence vegetation shifts and humus type (calcic mull to mor humus).

- Role of Limestone Bedrock and Transported Material
  - Bedrock supplies nutrients and drainage; its insoluble residues contribute to pedogenesis.
  - Transported materials (glacial drift, head deposits, loess-like aeolian inputs) frequently dominate the fine fractions and strongly influence soil textures.
  - Aeolian inputs are considered but generally not the dominant source; glacial drift and head deposits more influential for fine fractions.

- The Rough Sike Trench (Illustrative Case)
  - Examined a low mound with thin superficial cover, showing rapid soil-depth variation and horizon development over short distances.
  - Demonstrated transitions from brown calcareous soil to acid brown earth with sharp horizon boundaries.
  - Case highlights intermixture of transported and bedrock-derived materials driving pedogenesis at micro-scales.

- Grazing and Land Use Effects
  - Grazing influences vegetation composition and thus pedogenesis by altering litter input and decomposition rates.
  - Exclusion experiments indicate shifts toward acidophilous species and potential podsolization in some areas; grazing modulates but does not solely determine soil evolution.
  - Burning, drainage, and mining are acknowledged as drivers of spatial variability and pedogenic trajectories.

- Practical Significance for Data Use
  - Moor House soils represent a coupled system of pedogenesis driven by microtopography, peat dynamics, limestone chemistry, and historic land use; data provide a site-specific framework for ecological research and landscape management.
  - Detailed site descriptions (e.g., Moss Burn, Currick, Hard Hill, Rough Sike, Green Hole) offer reproducible, map-based data products for land management in carbonate uplands with peat influence.
  - Integrated dataset supports:
    - Ecological modeling of soil-vegetation interactions under peat dynamics.
    - Conservation planning for upland carbonate habitats.
    - Transferable insights for similar limestone–peat landscapes where transported material and bedrock residues shape soil formation.

- Key Data-Use Considerations and Challenges
  - Distinguishing transported from residual limestone material requires multiple lines of evidence (mineralogy, grain-size, horizon morphology).
  - Aeolian loess signals are debated; inferences must be interpreted with grain-size, homogeneous texture, mineral suites, and presence of boulders.
  - Soil succession from rendzina to deeper soils can be abrupt, influenced by drainage and root distribution rather than gradual pedogenesis.
  - Classification on Moor House is context-dependent; transport-derived material often dominates fine fractions, complicating simple bedrock-based taxonomy.

- Example Profiles (illustrative details from the Brown Calcareous Soil and related soils)
  - Brown Calcareous Soil (Sample no’s R.S. 26, 27, 28; Moss Burn area)
    - Horizon 0-2: Very dark brown friable sandy loam with dense root mat; high organic matter.
    - Horizon 2-7: Dark brown, firm clay loam with abundant roots; boundary between horizons.
    - Horizon 7-10: Very dark brown, stony clay loam with limestone fragments at the interface.
    - Bedrock: Tyne Bottom Limestone (contextual).
    - Vegetation: Agrosto-Festucetum.
  - Additional profiles (e.g., Peaty Gleyed Podzol and Peaty Gley) illustrate peat influence with mor humus, bleached/gley horizons, and saturated conditions near peat boundaries.
  - These profiles show explicit horizon sequences, color descriptions, texture, structure, root presence, organic content, and bedrock contact.

- Data Use Notes
  - The dataset enables site-specific ecological modeling, conservation planning, and extrapolation to similar carbonate uplands with peat influence.
  - Outputs are designed to support self-service exploration and interpretation of soil-vegetation relationships within a peat- and limestone-influenced landscape.
