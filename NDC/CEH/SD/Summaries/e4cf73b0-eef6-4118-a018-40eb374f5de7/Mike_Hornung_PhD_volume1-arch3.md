# THE MORPHOLOGY, MINERALOGY AND GENESIS OF SOME SOILS ON THE MOOR HOUSE NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE

- Aim and scope
  - Investigates soils on limestone grasslands across multiple sites to understand soil genesis, depth-related evolution, and interrelationships with geology, microtopography, climate, and vegetation.
  - Provides a framework for interpreting soil evolution under environmental change and for monitoring policy-relevant environmental health indicators.

- Data, methods and monitoring implications
  - Extensive fieldwork and laboratory analyses (insoluble limestone residue, heavy minerals, clay minerals, grain size; X-ray techniques).
  - Outputs include soil profiles, maps, and vegetation data; emphasizes integration of pedology with geology, topography, climate, and vegetation.
  - Monitoring implications:
    - Baseline mapping of soil types and pedogenic processes across topographic zones and microtopography.
    - Repeated soil profiling and mineralogical analyses to track horizon evolution, texture changes, and ferric/cemented horizon development.
    - Integration of climate and vegetation monitoring with soil observations to interpret leaching, humus formation, and drainage dynamics.
    - Robust data governance: complete metadata, open data formats, sharing with originators, versioning, and provenance tracking.

- Major soil sub-groups and key characteristics
  - Rendzina: very shallow over limestone bedrock; mull humus A horizon; strong root presence; surface strongly influenced by limestone; horizon boundaries often sharp.
  - Brown Calcareous Soil: linked to rendzinas and zones lacking very shallow rendzina; dark A horizon; clay-rich B horizon; calcium-dominated with moderate to high base saturation; pH typically 5.5–6.5 at surface; presence of “gingerbread” decalcified limestone fragments in some variants.
  - Acid Brown Earths: on mounds of superficial material and grassland edges transitioning to peat; deep A and strongly textured B horizons; very high clay content; low base saturation and low calcium; often acidic; distinction between two types by gingerbread material.
  - Peaty Gleyed Podzols (and related peaty gleys): develop at peat-adjacent margins or on mounds with peat contact; deep, gleyed B horizons; mor humus surface with sharp boundary to mineral horizons; very acidic with low calcium.
  - Monitoring implications:
    - Microtopography and drainage strongly govern soil type distribution.
    - Presence of transported materials (colluvium/drift) versus residual limestone residues affects nutrient status and horizon development.

- Depth of superficial material and soil succession
  - Depth of unconsolidated superficial material governs soil type and pedogenic stage.
  - Rendzina to brown calcareous soil transitions linked to increasing depth and decalcification of limestone residues.
  - Deeper superficial material aligns with acid brown earths and peaty podzols, with increasing acidity and reduced calcium availability.
  - Microtopography (grykes, blocks) can create local variation; shallow grykes may host calcareous soils while nearby blocks host rendzinas.
  - Progressive shift from rendzina to acid brown earth to peaty gleyed podzols reflects depth, drainage, leaching, and nutrient regime evolution.

- Role of limestone bedrock in soil development and nutrient availability
  - Bedrock provides calcium and other nutrients to surface vegetation in shallow soils; residues are incorporated into soils where present.
  - In deeper soils, limestone more often contributes to drainage and bases for acidification processes; direct nutrient supply declines with depth.
  - Decalcification extent and gingerbread residues influence texture, mineralogy, and horizon development.

- Vegetation, nutrient cycling and soil evolution
  - Vegetation shifts among calcicolous and calcifuge communities track soil acidity and nutrient status.
  - Litter input and humus formation influence horizon structure; grazing and vegetation management affect litter input and decomposition, thus soil evolution pathways.

- Grazing and land-use implications
  - Grazing reduces surface litter, potentially accelerating organic matter incorporation and influencing soil acidity and horizon development.
  - Exclosures show potential transient suppression of acid-sensitive species with grazing cessation, and possible shifts toward podzolisation in some cases.
  - Interaction between grazing and depth of superficial material can steer evolution toward acid brown earth or peaty podzols depending on site conditions.

- Trench investigations: Rough Sike and Moss Burn sites
  - Rough Sike trench reveals a buried A/B sequence with decalcified limestone patches near the surface, highlighting local vertical variation due to microtopography and drainage.
  - Moss Burn – Sheep Fold trench shows a transition from brown calcareous soil to peaty gleyed podzol, with buried layers and mixed transported/residual materials; emphasizes peat presence and sharp humus-mineral boundaries as drivers of soil progression.

- Practical monitoring takeaways for monitoring frameworks
  - Baseline and mapping needs
    - Map distributions of rendzina, brown calcareous soils, acid brown earths, and peaty podzols/gleys across topographic zones and microtopography.
    - Track transitions with depth of superficial material and identify sharp boundaries versus gradual transitions.
  - Monitoring metrics and indicators
    - Horizon development: A, B horizon changes, structure, color variations, ferric mottling.
    - Chemistry: pH gradients (surface to depth), calcium oxide content, base saturation, carbonate content, exchangeable cations.
    - Mineralogy: limestone residue vs. transported input; clay minerals (illite, chlorite, kaolinite), heavy minerals.
    - Hydrology and drainage: gleying, peat influence, groundwater-related horizon changes.
    - Vegetation and litter: shifts in calcicolous vs. calcifuge species; humus formation interfaces with mineral soil.
  - Data governance and interoperability
    - Standardized metadata, open formats, dataset sharing with originators; provenance and versioning; integrate with climate and vegetation data.
  - Methodological cautions
    - Use multiple lines of evidence (mineralogy, grain size, heavy minerals, chemical analyses) rather than relying on a single loess-type curve to infer transport origins.
    - Transporte material (colluvium, drift) often blends with limestone residue, complicating attribution of soil type to a single source.
  - Policy-relevant implications
    - Soil evolution pace and direction depend on depth of superficial material, bedrock purity, drainage, and grazing; monitor for interactions among drivers.
    - Expect rapid local changes at microtopographic boundaries (grykes, hummocks) and where peat encroachment or grazing exclosures alter litter input and drainage.

- Evolution, history and controlling factors (15.1–15.5)
  - Macro- and microtopography influence site evolution; three limestone types (Tyne Bottom, Scar, Four Fathom) drive distinct topographic features and scarp development; thicker limestones tend to produce more pronounced features.
  - Depth and presence of superficial material determine horizon progression (rendzina → brown calcareous soil → acid brown earth → peaty podzol/gleys); transport history (aeolian vs colluvial) and peat presence shape current soil types.
  - Springs at the base of limestone outcrops, driven by aquifers and eastward dip, promote instability and sapping, enhance erosion at outcrop bases, and influence peat removal.
  - Shake holes and swallow holes (pre-glacial to post-glacial features) control drainage, peat/drive removal, and landscape evolution; their presence can inhibit or promote peat development depending on local drainage and infilling.
  - Surface water drainage often dominates erosion, with streams re-excavating old valleys and promoting underground drainage re-establishment; thickness of superficial material remains contingent on timing of drainage re-emergence.
  - The combination of microtopography, drainage style (surface vs underground), erosion history, and exogenous factors like grazing and mining history shapes the present soil distribution and depth.
  - In sites not associated with streams, thicker superficial deposits persist longer; in stream-associated sites, rapid downcutting and re-excavation govern soil thinning and horizon formation.

- Concluding perspective
  - Moor House soils result from a complex interplay of glacial/drift input, transported materials, limestone residues, microtopography, drainage, and vegetation; dominant processes include glacially-derived inputs with colluvial/drift contributions and selective leaching toward peaty podzols in deeper or more acidic regimes.
  - For monitoring, establish baselines across limestone bedrock types and topography, track horizon evolution and nutrient dynamics, and integrate soil data with climate and vegetation observations within a robust data governance framework.
