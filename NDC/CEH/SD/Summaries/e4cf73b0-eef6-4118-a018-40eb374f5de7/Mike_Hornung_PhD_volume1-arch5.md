# THE MORPHOLOGY, MINERALOGY AND GENESIS OF SOME SOILS ON THE MOOR HOUSE NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE

## Aim and Scope
- Detailed examination linking soil morphology, mineralogy, genesis, vegetation, climate history, and human influences at Moor House grassland sites.
- Data describe parent materials (Tyne Bottom, Scar, Four Fathom limestones), topography, drainage, peat dynamics, and post-glacial history; site- and horizon-level data supported by maps, profiles, and mineral/chemical analyses.
- Data governance-oriented focus: enable discovery, reuse, and cross-site comparability while acknowledging provenance and licensing.

## Data Types and Features
- Site- and horizon-level data for limestone grassland soils, including:
  - Soil profiles and horizons (A, B, C, sub-horizons) with descriptive color, texture, structure, roots, boundary details.
  - Quantitative horizon data: pH, calcium oxide (CaO), carbonate content, base saturation, organic carbon, loss on ignition, texture class, horizon thickness.
  - Mineral/element analyses: insoluble limestone residues, mineral fractions, presence of decalcified “gingerbread” material, heavy minerals, illite/chlorite distribution.
  - Geological/parent material context: Tyne Bottom, Scar, Four Fathom limestones with variable solubility and residues; decalcification processes; gingerbread residues.
  - Vegetation associations, microtopography, and soil-forming influences: Agrosto-Festucetum, Nardetum sub-alpinum, Juncus squarossus; hummock-hollow surfaces; grykes and limestone outcrops.
  - Documented sites and trenches with site elevation, aspect, bedrock context; accompanying plates/figures.
- Temporal and governance context: data reflect post-glacial climate history and peat dynamics; cross-linking to original sources and plates is important for provenance.

## Soil Types and Characteristics
- Rendzina: very shallow on lime-rich outcrops; deep humus-rich A horizon; sharp B horizon boundaries; microtopography-driven depth variation.
- Brown Calcareous Soil: shallow to moderate depths on limestone surfaces; mull humus on A horizon; variable B horizon color; gingerbread material in impure limestones.
- Acid Brown Earths: on limestone-associated mounds/edges; acid humus A horizon; reddish-brown B horizon with limited illuviation; two sub-types by gingerbread fragments and decalcification degree.
- Peaty Gleyed Podzols and Peaty Gleys: peat-adjacent edges or mounds; mor humus with bleached/humus-separated B horizons; strong gleying; very acidic with low CaO and base saturation.
- Peaty Gley: deeper, well-developed mor humus atop highly acid, iron-rich mineral soil; pan features and root mats common.
- General pattern: transported materials (drift/colluvium) mix with limestone residues; superficial material depth governs soil type sequences; progression often from rendzina to brown calcareous to acid brown earth to peaty gleyed podzols/gleys with depth.

## Provenance, Transport, and Origin Insights
- Distinction between in-situ limestone-derived materials and transported (glacial drift, head, aeolian loess) components.
- Evidence for substantial transported material in most profiles; loess-type contributions debated, with clay/fine-fraction variability supporting drift origin in many cases.
- Gingerbread (decalcified) residues indicate near-surface limestone contributions; deeper horizons often reflect transported components.
- Variation across limestones (Tyne Bottom, Scar, Four Fathom) in residue dominance and transported clay/silt fractions.
- Across all sites, transported material significantly shapes soil development; the degree of limestone residue depends on impurity and depth.

## Topography, Springs, Shake Holes, and Drainage
- Springs at the base of limestone outcrops influence superficial deposits and stability; springs can cut back scars and accentuate erosion when exposed.
- Shake holes and swallow holes markedly affect drainage, peat removal, and the distribution of drift/head material; large swallow holes (up to tens of feet) likely pre-glacial and may become infilled over time as peat forms.
- Shake holes are typically small-scale; swallow holes can re-open drainage networks and drive erosion pathways.
- Many limestone grassland areas show a combination of features (breaks of slope, springs, shake/ swallow holes) controlling peat removal and superficial-matter thinning.

## Surface Water Drainage and Geomorphology
- Surface drainage often dominates erosion in many sites; where streams cross limestone outcrops or converge, erosion lowers peat and drift rapidly.
- Pre-glacial drift/head remnants and blanket peat histories indicate that many sites were once more extensively covered, with erosion revealing underlying surfaces.
- Re-establishment of drainage (including underground pathways) after glaciation significantly determines remaining superficial material and soil depth.
- Important factors for soil depth and distribution: micro-topography, erosion style (surface vs. subsurface), and duration of rapid erosion before drainage stabilization.
- Examples: some sites show limited thinning due to short-lived or absent surface streams; others exhibit substantial thinning where streams cut back into limestone and later reestablish underground drainage.

## Hydrology, Chronology, and Peat Dynamics
- Ombrigenous/peat development began around 5500 BCE; stream development predated major peat expansion by several thousand years.
- Peat erosion dates are variable; major peat erosion inferred around 500 BCE in Pennine analogies, with stream-driven drainage re-establishment continuing afterward.
- Post-glacial drainage reconfiguration and underground drainage reactivation governed the present distribution of superficial materials.
- The thickness and preservation of superficial material depend on stream activity, underground drainage timing, and proximity to pre-glacial surfaces.
- Some sites retain thicker superficial deposits where drainage remained slow or absent; others are thinned where streams and underground networks re-excavated valleys.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Implications
- The Moor House soils dataset is multi-source and site-specific, requiring a unified metadata framework and cross-linking to original plates and publications.
- Horizon terminology should be harmonized to support cross-site interoperability while retaining historical classifications alongside modern interpretations.
- Licensing and provenance: data are tied to Moor House/Nature Conservancy; reuse must respect permissions for figures, plates, and text; ensure provenance links to Moor House publications.
- Temporal and geological context: document the time frame for each horizon sequence and the broader climatic/geological setting.
- Data granularity and architecture: provide horizon-level data per site plus site-level metadata (elevation, aspect, bedrock type) with multi-resolution storage to support both site-scale mapping and horizon-level analyses.
- Interoperability: standardize taxonomy, horizon naming, and units to enable integration with modern soil databases and GIS; include notes on uncertainties and transitional forms (e.g., rendzina vs. brown calcareous soil vs. acid brown earth).
- Take care to preserve both historic classifications and contemporary interpretations to enable robust cross-site comparisons.

## Takeaways for Data Custodians and Users
- The Moor House soils dataset is rich and multi-source, tying pedogenesis to parent materials, glacial history, microtopography, vegetation, and human activity.
- Effective stewardship requires thorough metadata, harmonized horizon terminology, preservation of historical classifications alongside modern standards, and clear licensing and provenance for reuse and cross-site analyses.
- Generate GIS-ready outputs (soil maps, horizon tables, mineralogical datasets) with explicit cross-references to field notes, maps, and publications for reproducibility.
- Document uncertainties, especially around transported vs. residual components and interpretations of decalcified “gingerbread” material.
- The data support cross-site comparisons across the three limestone types (Tyne Bottom, Scar, Four Fathom) and illustrate how varying superficial material depth shapes soil evolution under different vegetation and drainage regimes.

## Summary takeaway
- The Moor House soils study provides a comprehensive, multi-source dataset that intimately ties pedogenesis to parent materials, glacial history, microtopography, vegetation, and anthropogenic influences. For stewardship, implement thorough metadata, harmonize horizon terminology, preserve historical classifications alongside modern standards, and ensure clear licensing and provenance to enable reuse and cross-site analyses.
