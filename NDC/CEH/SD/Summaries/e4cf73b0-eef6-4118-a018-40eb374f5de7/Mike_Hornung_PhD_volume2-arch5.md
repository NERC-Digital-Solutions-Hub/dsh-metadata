# Soil Survey of Moor House National Nature Reserve

- A detailed pedological assessment focusing on soil reaction (pH), nitrogen, exchangeable cations, base saturation, total chemical composition, trace elements, clay mineralogy, calcium carbonate, extractable iron, and heavy minerals.
- Uses standard historical methods and discusses implications for soil classification, genesis, and landscape evolution on Pennine moorlands, with emphasis on calcareous vs non-calcareous soils and their drainage contexts.
- Provides guidance on data interpretation, measurement techniques, and the relationship between bedrock, drift materials, and soil horizons.

## c. 3. Soil reaction (pH)

- pH measured electrometrically on soil/water suspensions; 1:2.5 soil:water ratio commonly used; time of year can affect pH readings.
- Some labs use M/100 CaCl2 to approximate field-conditions soil solution; CaCl2 readings are typically 0.5–1.0 pH units lower than in water.
- pH categories used: strongly acid (~<4.5), moderately acid (4.5–5.5), slightly acid (5.5–6.5), neutral (6.5–7.5).
- Calcareous soils (rendzinas and brown calcareous soils) tend to be neutral to near-neutral, especially in subsoil; surface horizons may be slightly acidic.
- Non-calcareous soils show varying acidity, generally increasing with leaching near the surface and becoming less acidic with depth; over limestone, depth-related pH increases are more pronounced.

## c. 4. Nitrogen

- Total nitrogen analyzed by Kjeldahl method; considered more stable than inorganic N for pedogenesis studies.
- Nitrogen contents range from 2.59% to 0.03%; highest in calcareous soils’ surface horizons and in some acid brown earth surfaces.
- Generally decreases with depth; some peaty gleys show increases down the profile due to organic matter translocation.
- Carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios indicate humus type: mull (low C:N) vs moder/mor humus (higher C:N); observed values suggest a mix of humus types, with field observations aligning mull humus with rendzina/brown calcareous soils.
- Peaty gleys often show higher N, reflecting decomposed organic matter; mineral horizons’ C:N values are still informative about humification.

## c. 5. Exchangeable cations and base saturation

- Exchangeable cations measured with ammonium acetate; results are conventional and most comparable within same method.
- Calcium (Ca) is the dominant cation in most soils, especially calcareous soils; values vary with depth and bedrock influence.
- Magnesium (Mg) ranges from very low to moderate; calcareous soils tend to higher Mg; trends with limestone over depth show increases in some profiles.
- Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) vary; notable observations include two peaty gleys where sodium dominates across horizons; overall potassium is often low, with occasional horizons high (e.g., 0.84 me/100 g in a surface horizon).
- General patterns: exchangeable cation contents reflect parent material (calcareous vs non-calcareous) and drainage status; soils over limestone show higher Ca and often higher base saturation.

## c. 6. Percentage base saturation

- Base saturation indicates acidity/leaching history and is influenced by parent material and drainage.
- Rendzinas show very high base saturation (60–100%), brown calcareous soils 31–90%, with depth-related increases in many calcareous soils.
- Non-calcareous soils typically have lower base saturation; podzols and peaty gleys exhibit relatively low values (often 5–15% in some horizons).
- Surface horizons of brown calcareous soils may be leached (low surface base saturation), while deeper horizons trend higher with depth.
- Overall, base saturation tends to increase with depth in soils over limestone; intense leaching is more evident in non-calcareous and peat-influenced profiles.

## c. 7. Total chemical analysis

- Aimed at determining total base contents (Ca, Mg, Na, K) and other major elements; used to distinguish bedrock influences and potential immobile elements for pedogenic interpretation.
- Calcium: 0.05% to 1.72%; low in peaty gleys, high in calcareous soils; highest horizons near calcareous bedrock show greater Ca content.
- Magnesium: 0.03–2.2%, generally higher in calcareous soils and in plots with specific mineral contents (e.g., rendzina with high chlorite).
- Sodium: range 0.0–1.62%; calcareous soils often moderate; unusual high sodium in some profiles correlates with specific mineralogy.
- Potassium: 0.62–4.47%; generally variable with depth and mineralogy; very high values linked to particular clay contents (illite-rich clays).
- Total iron and other elements indicate movement and clay-content relationships; profiles over limestone show distinct patterns tied to bedrock and drift materials.

## c. 8. Trace elements

- Trace elements (e.g., lead, zinc, strontium, zirconium) analyzed to aid provenance and sedimentary differences (sedentary over limestone vs drift).
- Strontium often elevated in sedentary soils over limestone; zirconium and rubidium distributions help differentiate parent materials.
- Lead and zinc can be elevated in certain limestone-related soils due to mineral veins; these elements may also be mobilized during podzolisation.
- Overall, trace element patterns help distinguish soil heritage (sedentary vs drift) when combined with other lines of evidence.

## c. 9. Clay mineralogy

- Clay mineralogy largely inherited from parent materials; common minerals reflect drift vs limestone-derived residues.
- Drift-derived soils frequently show illite-dominated clays (from Carboniferous shales in glacial drift).
- Rendzinas over Scar Limestone tend to be kaolin-dominated (inherited from limestone insoluble residues); Tyne Bottom Limestone calcareous soils may show chlorite-dominated clays.
- Humus iron podzols on Great Dun Fell commonly contain kaolin; presence of kaolin indicates proximity to Namurian bedrock and sedentary materials.
- Western escarpment drift soils indicate illite-rich clays; base soils over limestone show kaolin or chlorite, reflecting bedrock sources.
- Clay mineralogy supports interpretation of sedimentary origin vs limestone-derived, aiding classification and landscape-scale soil evolution understanding.

## c. 10. Calcium carbonate

- Soils containing free calcium carbonate are grouped as calcareous; carbonate contents are used for classification and to assess soluble Ca contributions to exchangeable Ca.
- CaCO3 contents are generally low, indicating extensive leaching in the climate.
- Rendzinas contain 1–3% CaCO3; brown calcareous soils 0.5–1.0% near the surface, rising to 1.0–1.5% near bedrock interface.

## c. 11. Extractable iron

- Extractable iron reflects the readily mobilizable fraction and is useful for understanding podzolisation and iron translocation.
- In brown earths, extractable Fe is relatively constant down the profile; in podzols, a maximum commonly occurs in B horizon with a minimum in A2.
- In some profiles, eluvial movement of Fe from A2 to B or in situ weathering can complicate interpretation.
- Patterns vary with parent material; podzols show higher Fe in B horizons compared with A, indicating translocation and soil evolution processes.

## c. 12. Heavy mineral analyses

- Heavy-mineral analysis uses fine sand/silt fractions with heavy liquids to infer parent material and sedimentary history.
- Drift materials (glacial drift) show a suite including illite-dominated clays, zircon, fluorite, garnet, tourmaline, rutile; rendzina and some calcareous soils may have kaolin and limited residues from limestone.
- In several rendzinas, some kaolin- and fluorite-dominated mineralogy points to limestone insoluble residues; other calcareous soils show chlorite-rich residues from limestone.
- Some soils indicate sedimentary origins over local bedrock, whereas others over drift show more diverse mineral assemblages, supporting the use of heavy-mineral analyses for provenance and lithology interpretation.

## Data management implications for Data Stewards

- Data structure and metadata
  - Capture site-level metadata (location, altitude, slope, bedrock type) and horizon-level data (horizon labels, depth intervals, color, texture, structure, pH, CaCO3, extractable cations, LOI, C/N, etc.).
  - Record analytical methods, units, detection limits, and the year/time of sampling to support reproducibility and longitudinal analyses.
- Standardization and crosswalks
  - Map historical horizon nomenclature (e.g., A, A1, B, C; AG, BG, CG) and older mineralogical terms to current taxonomy and modern soil classifications.
  - Harmonize units across sections (percentages, meq/100 g, pH in water vs CaCl2) and provide a data dictionary with a crosswalk table.
- Provenance, reproducibility, and quality
  - Document sampling context (bedrock proximity, peat/limestone interfaces, drainage status) and landscape drainage sequences influencing pedogenesis.
  - Flag incomplete data, measurement uncertainties, and potential biases from historical methods; include notes on comparability between labs and techniques.
- Machine readability and accessibility
  - Provide machine-readable exports (CSV/JSON) with stable identifiers for sites, horizons, and samples; include licensing, reuse rights, and a clear data dictionary.
- Use cases and integration
  - Data support pedogenesis studies, hydrology-soil interactions, and moorland ecosystem research; enable integration with other soil datasets by aligning terminology and measurement conventions.
- Recommended practices
  - Maintain a cross-disciplinary approach: combine pH, nitrogen, cations, carbonate, trace elements, mineralogy, and heavy-mineral data to build comprehensive, interoperable soil profiles.
  - Include narrative provenance and methodological notes to support reproducibility and cross-dataset comparisons.

Overall, the document provides a comprehensive, methodically documented chemistry and mineralogy framework for Moor House soils, with explicit guidance on historical measurement techniques, interpretation of horizon-scale properties, and clear implications for data standardization and reuse by data stewards.
