# THE MORPHOLOGY, MINERAL0LOGY AND GENESIS OF SOME SOILS ON THE MOOR HOUSE NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE

- Purpose for GIS: provides map-ready soil properties and diagnostic horizons to link pedogenesis with spatial features (bedrock, surface geology, topography) for map-based visualization and spatial modeling.

## c.3. Soil pH
- pH measured electrometrically in soil-water suspensions; 1:2.5 soil-to-water ratio standard; CaCl2 (Schofield & Taylor) used by some labs to better reflect field conditions; CaCl2 readings tend to be 0.5–1.0 pH units lower than in water.
- pH classes: strongly acid ~4.5, moderately acid 4.5–5.5, slightly acid 5.5–6.5, neutral 6.5–7.5.
- Trends by soil type: calcareous soils show highest pH (rendzinas near neutral; brown calcareous subsoil near neutral), non-calcareous soils vary in acidity and generally become less acidic with depth.
- Pedogenetic patterns: acid brown earths and brown podzols show surface horizons often more acidic, peaty gleys and related soils are strongly acid; depth increase in pH more pronounced where calcareous material influences over limestone.

## c.4. Nitrogen
- Total nitrogen determined by Kjeldahl method; relatively stable measure for pedogenesis work.
- Concentrations range from 2.59% to 0.03%; highest in calcareous mineral horizons and surface horizons of acid brown earths.
- Depth trends: most soils show decreasing nitrogen with depth; two peaty gleyed podzols show increases down the profile.
- Carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios indicate humification: mull-type humus yields lower C:N (3–9 in rendzinas, 4–15 in brown calcareous soils); moder/mor humus higher; peaty gleys/podzols often show high organic content with high C and variable C:N.
- GIS relevance: nitrogen and C:N proxies help infer humus type and pedogenic state across units; patterns align with horizon designations (A1, A2, B, C).

## c.5. Exchangeable cations and base saturation
- Method: neutral ammonium acetate extraction; results are conventional but comparable within the same method; cations analyzed typically Ca, Mg, K, Na.
- Calcium: dominant in most soils; calcareous soils show highest Ca; rendzinas high Ca; non-calcareous soils lower Ca; depth over limestone can increase Ca with depth.
- Magnesium: ranges from very low to moderate; calcareous soils often higher; profiles can show increasing Mg with depth over limestone; little consistent pattern across sub-groups.
- Potassium: overall low to moderate; generally very low values are common; a few horizons show higher K (e.g., a horizon with high illite content); large H2O-soluble calcium in calcareous soils can affect readings.
- Sodium: ranges from negligible to moderate; two peaty gleys show sodium-dominated horizons in some cases.
- Base saturation: highest in calcareous soils (rendzinas 60–100%; brown calcareous soils 31–90%); other sub-groups more variable with depth; podzols and peaty gleys often low (5–40% or lower).
- GIS relevance: layer combinations of Ca, Mg, K, Na and base saturation help map soil fertility status, calcareous vs non-calcareous domains, and leaching/podzolation processes.

## c.6 Percentage base saturation
- Definition: proportion of cation-exchange capacity occupied by Ca, Mg, K, and Na; method depends on extractant used ( ammonium acetate here).
- Calcareous soils generally show higher base saturation; rendzinas high (60–100%), brown calcareous soils variable (31–90%); non-calcareous soils lower and more variable.
- Depth effects: base saturation often increases with depth in many soils, especially those over limestone; podzols and peaty soils may show lower surface saturation with rises deeper in profile.
- GIS relevance: base saturation maps indicate leaching/podzolation intensity and help distinguish calcareous from non-calcareous soil groups in spatial models.

## c.7 Total chemical analysis
- Purpose: determine total plant-nutrient contents and potential immobile elements for pedogenesis interpretation; X-ray fluorescence used (briquetting and fusion methods discussed); standards are critical; results are most reliable when treated as relative guides.
- Major element totals (approximate ranges): Ca 0.05%–1.72%; Mg 0.03%–2.2%; Na, K generally low (with some exceptions); calcareous soils show higher Ca and Mg; peaty podzols and humus podzols tend to have lower totals.
- Special notes: Rendzina and rendzina-like soils over limestone show distinctive Ca/Mg patterns; two high-magnesium rendzina profiles align with chlorite-rich parent material; some drift- vs sedentary-material interpretations supported by total chemistry.
- GIS relevance: total-element baselines assist in differentiating parent materials and bedrock influence; support for distinguishing sedentary limestone-derived soils from drift-derived soils when combined with clay mineralogy and trace elements.

## c.8 Trace elements
- Technique: X-ray fluorescence; used to aid provenance and sedimentary origin in soils (sedentary over limestone vs drift-derived).
- Notable patterns: Sr tends to be higher in sedentary soils over limestone; rubidium and zirconium higher in drift-derived contexts; Pb and Zn can be elevated in limestone-veined areas (e.g., Rough Sike site) due to mineralization.
- GIS relevance: trace-element signatures help classify soils by provenance, aiding spatial discrimination between sedimentary bedrock-influenced soils and drift-derived soils in maps and predictive models.

## c.9 Clay mineralogy
- Concept: clay assemblages are inherited from parent material or formed via in-situ weathering; most likely inherited given regional climate; methods identify illite, kaolin, chlorite, and other minerals.
- Key associations:
  - Drift-derived soils east of the summit ridge: illite-dominated clays (from Carboniferous shales in drift).
  - Calcareous soils over Scar Limestone: kaolin-dominated clays (from limestone insoluble residue).
  - Calcareous soils over Tyne Bottom Limestone: chlorite-dominated clays.
  - Humus iron podzols on Great Dun Fell: kaolin-dominant clays (from Namurian beds), indicating proximity to summit geology.
  - Summit ridge soils: kaolin-rich clays common in humus iron podzols; suggests local bedrock influence and sedimentary derivation close at hand.
- GIS relevance: clay mineralogy supports mapping of parent material sources and helps distinguish drift vs sedentary origins; clay type informs horizon development potential and drainage implications in spatial models.

## c.10 Calcium carbonate
- Purpose: identify free CaCO3 and its influence on soil classification and chemistry; small quantities indicate strong leaching in this climate.
- Findings: rendzinas contain 1–3% CaCO3; brown calcareous soils 0.5–1.0% near surface and 1.0–1.5% nearer bedrock interface.
- GIS relevance: CaCO3 content helps delineate calcareous zones and predict horizon development and drainage patterns; important for classifying calcareous vs non-calcareous soil units in maps.

## c.11 Extractable iron
- Focus: readily extractable iron as the active pool for podzolisation processes; Deb method used; results show horizon- and profile-specific patterns.
- General trends: brown earths – relatively constant down the profile; podzols – minimum in A2, maxima in B, decreases in C; higher iron in B horizons of brown podzolics compared to acid brown earths.
- Interpretation caveats: iron movement may reflect elution from upper horizons or in-situ weathering; iron-content comparisons across parent materials can be confounded by underlying composition; sometimes co-occurs with increased clay content.
- GIS relevance: iron distribution patterns help identify podzolisation intensity and horizon translocations; useful as a slope- and horizon-specific layer in pedogenic models.

## c.12 Heavy mineral analyses
- Rationale: heavy mineral suites in fine sand/silt fractions reflect the insoluble residue of parent rocks and help differentiate sedentary vs drift-derived soils.
- Method: separation with heavy liquids (e.g., brine or bromoform), mounting and petrographic identification.
- Findings: many soils contain diverse heavy minerals (garnet, tourmaline, rutile, zircon, fluorite, etc.); some rendzinas over limestone may be dominated by fluorite/zircon indicating limestone residue, though most soils are not limestone insoluble-residue-derived.
- Implications: drift-derived soils typically show illite-dominated clays with drift minerals; rendzinas show variable heavy-mineral signatures; supports provenance interpretation for GIS mapping.
- GIS relevance: heavy-mineral signatures enrich provenance classification, aiding separation of sedimentary vs sedentary soil units in spatial analyses.

## GIS data and mapping implications (synthesis)
- Layer concepts to support map-based products:
  - SoilMajorGroup (e.g., Skeletal/Calcareous/Brown earths/Podzols/Gley/Organic)
  - SoilSubGroup ( Rendzina; Brown Calcareous Soil; Normal Acid Brown Earth; Acid Brown Earth with Gleying; Brown Podzolic Soils; Humus Iron Podzols; Peaty Podzols; Peaty Gleys; Gley Podzolic; Peaty Gleys; Basin/Band Blanket Peat)
  - SurfaceType (peat, drift, dissected limestone surfaces)
  - ParentMaterial (sandstone, Whin Sill, limestone; drift vs sedentary)
  - Horizons (A1, A2, B, C; and variants like A2G, Bt, Bpan, etc.)
  - PedoclimaticIndices (pH class, base saturation, C:N ratio, extractable iron)
  - Drainage/Hydrology (gley presence, water table indicators)
  - MineralogyProxies (clay minerals: illite, kaolin, chlorite; trace-element proxies: Sr, Zr, Pb, Zn)
  - HeavyMineralSignature (dominant heavy minerals by site)
  - Site and coordinates (e.g., Cross Fell, Knock Fell, Melmerby Scar) with altitude
- Visualization ideas for GIS:
  - SurfaceType vs SoilSubGroup to show microtopographic control on pedogenesis
  - Overlay HIP-like deep variants with drainage risk layers
  - Pedo-climatic indices combined with soil type predictions under moisture changes
  - Integrate mineralogy and trace elements for lithology/provenance discrimination
- Data quality and transfer considerations (relevant for GIS data prep):
  - High micro-scale variability and discrete sampling limit transferability; many profiles are discontinuous
  - Overlaps and intergrades between sub-groups; horizon nomenclature must be accurately captured for queries
  - Use consistent extraction methods and document method choices (e.g., NH4OAc, CaCl2, XRF) to ensure comparability across layers
- Practical cautions for GIS analysts:
  - Treat total chemical and trace-element data as guiding indicators rather than absolute qualifiers; integrate with provenance and mineralogy for robust classification
  - Recognize that some patterns are site-specific (e.g., near limestone bedrock vs drift-blanketed zones) and support localized mapping decisions
  - When building predictive models, incorporate topography and bedrock geology (limestone vs drift) as primary drivers for soil type distribution
