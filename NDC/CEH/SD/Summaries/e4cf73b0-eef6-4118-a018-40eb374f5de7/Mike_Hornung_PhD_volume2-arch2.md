# Acid Brown Earths

- Analyzes two main acid brown earth types and their gleyed equivalents, focusing on horizon morphology, parent materials, and altitudinal distribution.
- Aims to provide standardized soil data for long-term environmental monitoring and to support interpretation of climate, hydrology, and land-use changes.

## Data collection, methods and monitoring relevance

- Uses standardized soil chemical analyses to enable cross-site comparability and baselining for environmental health monitoring.
- Documents field-to-lab protocols for horizon descriptions, enabling detection of climate/hydrology/land-use changes over time.
- Profiles span escarpment and limestone features (e.g., Melmerby Scar Limestone, Great Limestone, Knock Fell) and reflect local rock influence (Whin Sill, limestone outcrops).

## c.3 Soil reaction (pH)

- pH measured electrometrically in a 1:2.5 soil/water suspension; occasionally in 0.01 M CaCl2 to better reflect field conditions.
- pH categories: strongly acid ~<4.5; moderately acid 4.5–5.5; slightly acid 5.5–6.5; neutral 6.5–7.5.
- Calcareous soils (rendzinas) are generally neutral; brown calcareous soils have neutral subsoil but surface horizons may be slightly acidic.
- Non-calcareous soils become less acidic with depth; acid brown earths and brown podzolic soils often show surface acidity stronger than subsoil; peaty gleys and related podzols remain strongly acidic, with depth-related acidity changes.

## c.4 Nitrogen

- Total nitrogen measured by Kjeldahl method to minimize fluctuation from inorganic nitrogen pools.
- Range: 2.59% to 0.03%; highest in surface horizons of calcareous soils and acid brown earths.
- Most soils show decreasing nitrogen with depth; some peaty gleys/podzols show increases down the profile due to organic matter translocation.
- Carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratios indicate humification stage: mull-type humus (low C:N) vs moder/mor humus (higher C:N); patterns vary by horizon and soil type.

## c.5 Exchangeable cations and base saturation

- Exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, Na determined via ammonium acetate extraction; results are conventional and best compared within the same method.
- Calcium generally dominant; highest Ca in calcareous soils; rendzinas and lower brown calcareous horizons show high Ca, surface horizons can be leached in brown calcareous soils.
- Magnesium ranges from very low to moderate; calcareous soils tend to higher Mg; depth patterns vary; over limestone, Mg can increase with depth.
- Sodium values span from high to very low; two peaty gleys show sodium-dominant horizons in all depths.
- Potassium values range widely but are typically low across most profiles; occasional high values linked to specific mineralogy (e.g., illite-rich clays).
- Overall patterns reflect parent material and leaching/podzolisation processes across sub-groups.

## c.6 Percentage base saturation

- Base saturation indicates soil acidity and leaching degree; calculated from cation exchange capacity and exchangeable cations.
- Rendzinas: 60–100% Ca; brown calcareous soils: 31–90%; over limestone, values rise with depth.
- Lower values in podzols and peaty soils; peaty gleys: generally 9–40%, concentrated 10–25%.
- Acid brown earths and brown podzolic soils show intermediate, highly variable results.
- Depth generally increases base saturation, especially where over limestone bedrock.

## c.7 Total chemical analysis

- Total analyses reveal maximum plant-available nutrients and provide clues on immobile elements and bedrock contributions.
- Calcium: 0.05%–1.72%; highest in calcareous soils; very low in some peaty podzols.
- Magnesium: 0.03%–2.2%; notably high in rendzinas; generally 1–2% in most profiles.
- Sodium: 0.01%–1.62%; calcareous soils often moderate; several profiles show very low values.
- Potassium: mostly 0.62%–4.47%; generally low to moderate; one high value linked to clay mineralogy (illite dominance).
- General pattern: total bases reflect parent material variability; some soils show distinct differences from underlying bedrock (e.g., sedentary rendzina vs drift-derived soils).
- Limitations: standardization of total analyses across labs; results best used as guides and compared with other techniques.

## c.8 Trace elements

- Analyzed to aid botanical studies and to distinguish sedentary soils over limestone from drift-derived soils.
- Strontium often higher in sedentary soils over limestone; rubidium and zirconium patterns support parent-material interpretations.
- Lead and zinc can be markedly elevated in some calcareous/limestone sites (e.g., Rough Sike area) due to limestone veining; may reflect mobility and local geology.
- Overall results are interpreted with caution due to matrix effects and lack of universal standards.

## c.9 Clay mineralogy

- Clay mineralogy largely inherited from parent materials; some local in-situ formation possible but synthesis is limited under current climate.
- Illite dominates soils derived from glacial drift east of the summit; kaolin dominates rendzinas over Scar Limestone; chlorite dominates brown calcareous soils over Tyne Bottom Limestone.
- Humus iron podzols on Great Dun Fell rich in kaolin; kaolin indicates proximity to Namurian sandstone sources, suggesting sedentary material.
- Western escarpment drift shows illite-rich clays; base of escarpment soils again show kaolin; overall patterns reflect complex parent materials and local geology.

## c.10 Calcium carbonate

- Soils with free calcium carbonate grouped as calcareous; analyses support classification and carbonates’ influence on exchangeable Ca.
- Rendzinas: 1–3% CaCO3; brown calcareous soils: 0.5–1.0% near top, 1.0–1.5% closer to bedrock contact.
- Low overall carbonate content indicates strong leaching under the region’s climate.

## c.11 Extractable iron

- Readily extractable iron reflects mobilizable iron available for podzolisation; patterns differ by soil type.
- Brown earths: relatively constant along profile; podzols: minimum in A2, maximum in B, then decrease in C.
- Iron movement and clay translocation appear in podzols; extraction method (Deb, 1950) provides conventional results; interpretation limited by total iron content of parent material.
- Some profiles show clear evidence of iron movement corresponding to horizon development.

## c.12 Heavy mineral analyses

- Heavy mineral fractions (fine sand/silt) used to infer parent material and differentiate sedentary vs drift origins.
- Drift-derived soils show illite-dominated clays; rendzinas may show limited fluorite/zircon if linked to limestone insoluble residue.
- Many soils contain diverse heavy minerals (garnet, tourmaline, rutile, zircon, fluorite) and are not derived from pure limestone residues.
- Qualitative approach; results combined with other evidence to interpret sedimentation history.

## Site-level indicators and monitoring patterns

- Altitudinal gradients influence acidification and podzol development.
- Drainage signals evident through A2G and C horizon gleying; transition horizons (Bt, BC, etc.) reflect podzolisation processes.
- Calcareous soil formation linked to limestone features; calcareous soil properties vary with depth and superficial cover thickness.
- Clay translocation and degree of podzolisation visible through base saturation and extractable iron patterns.
- Peat interactions modify drainage and horizon evolution, affecting horizon development and hydrology.
- Data context across escarpment/limestone features and local lithology (Whin Sill, limestone outcrops) informs monitoring baselines.

## Data quality and monitoring considerations

- Acknowledges the need for standardized methods across labs; caveats regarding calibration of pH, cation exchange, and total element analyses.
- Emphasizes replication, duplicate analyses, and cross-method comparisons to ensure data utility for long-term monitoring.
- Encourages integration with vegetation and landscape data to support interpretation of environmental changes and climato-genetic trajectories.
