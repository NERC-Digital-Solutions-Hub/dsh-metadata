# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

## Overview
- Climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, to simulate drought and warming for upland moorland over the next 20–30 years.
- Automated roof technology provides drought and warming treatments; site powered by solar and wind.
- Established in 1998; involves replicated drought and warming treatments with three replicate plots for each treatment and three control plots (total n = 9 plots).
- Dominant vegetation: Calluna vulgaris (heather) with other species present; soil type: humo-ferric podzol.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Treatments and layout
  - Warming (W), Drought (D), and Control (C) plots across 3 blocks.
  - Each treatment replicated three times; control scaffolding mirrors shading from experimental structures.
  - Plot size: 4 m x 5 m.
- Drought treatment
  - Operated May–September (1999–2011); since 2012: April–October.
  - Retrieval roof excludes rainfall, reducing annual rainfall by ~20% and excluding ~80% of growing-season rainfall.
  - Roofing not used in winds > 10 m s-1.
  - Timings adapted to replicate UK drought events; timing and reductions recorded annually.
- Warming treatment
  - Retractable aluminium curtains reflect infrared radiation; reduces night-time heat loss.
  - Roofs retract upon rainfall to avoid rainfall exclusion; annual rainfall reduction ~14%.
  - Winds above threshold also prevent curtain operation.
- Site characteristics
  - Coordinates: 53°03'19"N, -3°27'55"W
  - Elevation and microclimate typical of upland west Atlantic moorland.

## Equipment, protocols, and data processing
- On-site infrastructure
  - Automated weather station (AWS) for meteorological data.
  - Micro-meteorological sensors in plots for soil temperature and moisture.
  - Rain gauges, lysimeters, suction samplers, and various soil and vegetation measurement tools.
- Data collection cadence
  - AWS meteorological data: daily (1999–present); sensors updated; mast height increased after 2007 due to thefts.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily (1998–present).
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry: biweekly sampling; site-level rainfall captured by storage gauge; plot-level throughfall data collected biweekly.
  - Water table depth: biweekly (from 2009).
  - Soil respiration and trace gases (CH4, N2O): fortnightly to monthly with collar chambers; multiple measurement systems over time; automated measurements from 2013–2014.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): sporadic years (2002–2004, 2011); multiple chamber systems.
  - Photosynthesis: ambient and response measurements in early years; multiple years (2001–2003, with additional datasets later).
  - Vegetation biomass (pin-point method): annual surveys (1998–2012, with ongoing later measurements).
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometer (2000–2004; select years 2000–2001, 2003–2004).
  - Phenology, annual growth, and pathogen assessment: annual shoot elongation and phenophase recording (1999–2009; higher-resolution checks in select years).
  - Vegetation chemistry: annual sampling of C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates.
  - Litterfall: monthly collection 1999–2002; later years less frequent; conversion to g m-2 and analyses for carbon and nitrogen.
  - Root biomass: multiple years (2003–2004, 2008, 2011) using soil cores and laboratory extraction.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation technique (2000, 2001, 2012).
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: intermittent measurements (1998–2004) using initial/final core comparisons.
  - SOM, SOC, and bulk density: soil core analyses to compute mass balance and surface carbon pools.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers; biweekly sampling (1998–2008).
- Data processing and units
  - Flux data converted to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1 or related units using standard conversions; multiple instrument types (CIRAS-2, LICOR 8100, LI-COR 6400) accommodated with explicit conversion factors.
  - Pin-point biomass conversion factors used to translate hits to biomass (g m-2), with species-specific calibrations.
  - Legacy datasets note variable documentation quality; QA performed via basic visual checks and standard lab methods.
- Data management and access
  - Not all data are stored in a single portal (EIDC); some datasets require direct contact for access.
  - Key contacts at CEH Bangor: Sabine Reinsch and Bridget Emmett; datasets span 1998–2015 and beyond.
  - Appendix includes site layout and quadrat plots.

## Key data categories and purpose
- AWS meteorological data: foundational climate context for treatments and ecosystem responses (temperature, humidity, rainfall, radiation, wind).
- Micro-meteorological plot data: in-plot temperature and soil moisture dynamics to link microclimate with treatments.
- Rainfall and rainfall chemistry: site-level precipitation and chemical composition for nutrient fluxes and deposition context.
- Throughfall data: plot-level rainfall partitioning under treatments to apportion treatment effects accurately.
- Water table depth: hydrological status and potential water stress under drought/warming.
- Soil respiration and trace gases: soil carbon fluxes and greenhouse gas emissions/uptake at plot scale.
- Net ecosystem exchange and photosynthesis: net carbon balance and photosynthetic activity linked to biomass and soil processes.
- Vegetation metrics (biomass, phenology, chemistry, litterfall): plant community structure, growth, and carbon/nutrient cycling under treatments.
- Canopy reflectance: remote-sensing proxies of plant status and stress (NDVI, PRI).
- Root biomass and soil microbial biomass: below-ground carbon and microbial dynamics under climate manipulations.
- Nitrogen mineralisation, SOM/SOC, bulk density, soil chemistry: soil fertility, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling changes.
- Litterfall and litter chemistry: input of organic matter and nutrient transfer to soil components.

## Particular considerations for analysts
- Local-scale and time-series focus: strong potential to analyse treatment effects across plots and years, including interactions between drought and warming.
- Data gaps and continuity: some datasets are intermittent or legacy-based with documentation variability; cross-checks required when combining older datasets.
- Data standardization: multiple measurement methods and instrument generations; apply appropriate conversion factors and align units when aggregating.
- Access and provenance: track data sources, metadata, and data custodians; some datasets require direct contact with CEH Bangor for retrieval.
- Target outcomes: correlations between climate treatments and ecosystem processes (soil respiration, NEE, trace gas fluxes, vegetation growth, carbon storage), as well as potential interactions among above- and below-ground pools.
