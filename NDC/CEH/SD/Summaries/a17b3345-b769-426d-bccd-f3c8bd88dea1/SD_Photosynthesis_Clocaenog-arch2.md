    - G: Leaf status (Healthy; Fungal infected; Herbivory)
    - H: Year
    - I–M: Temporal markers (Day, Month, Hour, Minute, Second)
    - N: CO2 concentration in the chamber (µmol CO2 mol-1 CO2)
    - O: Change in CO2 concentration over the measurement period
    - P: Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR)
    - Q: Water content (in the chamber during measurements)
    - R: Difference in water content (during the period of measurement)
    - S: Temperature (°C)
    - T: Area of measurement cuvette (cm²)

- Notable differences and considerations
  - Species coverage:
    - Dataset 1: Calluna vulgaris and Vaccinium myrtillus.
    - Dataset 2: Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum.
  - Biological status:
    - Dataset 2 includes leaf status categories (Healthy, Fungal infected, Herbivory); Dataset 1 does not.
  - Replication:
    - Dataset 1 notes replication only for data from 04/07/2002 (G column).
  - Temporal formatting:
    - Some column descriptions in Dataset 2 show inconsistencies (e.g., “L, Hour = Minute; M, Hour = Second”), indicating potential formatting issues in the metadata that may require careful alignment with the actual data.
  - Measurements:
    - Both datasets cover CO2 concentration, CO2 changes, PAR, water content, temperature, leaf traits, photosynthesis, and related gas-exchange metrics, but the exact column labels and presence differ slightly as described above.

- Data handling and analysis context for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Data workflow
    - Identify required data from established sources, verify, quality assure, clean, and transform.
    - Apply standardised analytical methods to generate outputs such as environmental health indicators or policy-relevant classifications.
  - Outputs and dissemination
    - Present results in clear formats (reports, maps, charts).
    - Ensure datasets are stored properly and uploaded to relevant data portals or repositories.
  - Data reuse and value
    - Aim to increase dataset value by integrating with other relevant data.
    - Provide access to underlying data used to produce final outputs to support transparency and reuse.
