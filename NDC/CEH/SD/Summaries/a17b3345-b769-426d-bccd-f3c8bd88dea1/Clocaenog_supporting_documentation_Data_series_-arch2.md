# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Purpose and scope
  - Climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest to simulate drought and warming for upland moorland over the next decades.
  - Automated roof technology and night-time warming curtains implemented; solar and wind power enabled.
  - Established in 1998 with replicated drought and warming treatments plus controls; location: Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales.

- Climate change treatments and design
  - Treatments: drought and warming, each with three replicates; plus three control plots (n=9 total plots laid out in blocks).
  - Drought treatment: 20% reduction in annual rainfall on drought plots; triggered by tipping-bucket rainfall sensor with retractable polyethylene roof; timing May–Sept (1999–2011) and April–October (since 2012); curtain operation restricted in high winds.
  - Warming treatment: night-time warming using retractable aluminium mesh curtains; curtains retracted during rainfall to minimize rainfall loss; average annual rainfall reduction ~14%; wind restrictions as above.
  - Plot layout and blocking detailed in site documentation (Tables 1–2).

- Site and ecological context
  - Ecosystem: wet upland heath dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather); other species include Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum; bryophytes present.
  - Soil: humo-ferric podzol with depth-variable eluvial (E) and illuvial (Bh) horizons.
  - Vegetation and soil baseline measures documented across multiple years (biomass, species cover, litter, roots, nutrients).

- Data types and datasets collected (summary)
  - AWS meteorological data: daily measurements (1999–current) including temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, pressure.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily plot-level soil and air temperature, soil moisture (2008–current; earlier methods used), etc.
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry: storage rain gauge (site-level, biweekly) and rainfall chemistry samples (pH, nitrate, chloride, sulfate, DOC, ammonium).
  - Throughfall data: plot-level rainfall (biweekly); used to compute treatment-specific rainfall differences; data quality checks and occasional infilling.
  - Water table depth: biweekly measurements from permeable tubes to bedrock (since 2009).
  - Soil respiration: fortnightly to daily campaigns transitioning through methods; collars installed; various instruments (IRGA, CIRAS, LI-COR 8100) used; fluxes converted to mg CO2-C m^-2 h^-1.
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): static chambers; gas sampling and GC analysis; dataset includes flux estimates.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): several years (2002–2004, 2011) using different chamber setups; photosynthesis estimated from NEE with biomass-adjusted corrections.
  - Photosynthesis: ambient measurements and response curves (A vs PAR, A vs Ci) across species and years; leaf area considerations for standardization.
  - Vegetation biomass (Pin-point method): multi-year surveys (1998–2012); biomass conversion factors provided; species-specific calibrations; data quality checks.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometer (2001–2004, with gaps); background vegetation and bare ground measurements included.
  - Vegetation phenology, annual growth, and pathogens: shoot elongation, budburst, leaf production; species-specific phenophases tracked (1999–2009, 2010–present).
  - Vegetation chemistry: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates; analyses on green and senesced material.
  - Litterfall: monthly to yearly collections (1999–2002, then less frequent); litter dried and weighed; pooled by quadrats; carbon and nitrogen analyses.
  - Root biomass: multiple campaigns (2003–2013) using soil cores; differentiation of organic and inorganic horizons; varying extraction methods.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012) with DOC measurements; biomass calculated per soil organic matter.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: staged core experiments (1998–2004); ammonium and nitrate analyses via autoanalyser; net mineralisation rates derived.
  - SOM/SOC and bulk density: soil organic matter and carbon densities from paired cores; bulk density calculations and conversions to g m^-2.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers; biweekly sampling; pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium analyses.
  - Appendix data: site and plot layout maps.

- Data processing, quality and harmonization
  - Data processing across datasets includes unit conversions (e.g., CO2 flux conversions between g m^-2 h^-1 and mg C m^-2 h^-1; µmol m^-2 s^-1 to mg CO2-C m^-2 h^-1).
  - Biomass and flux adjustments: NEE and photosynthesis adjusted for biomass differences using vegetation measurements; pin-hits to biomass calibrations (Tables 5–6 provide species-specific factors).
  - Equipment changes and methodological evolution: multiple generations of sensors and instruments (CIRAS-2, LICOR LI-8100, LI-COR 8100A, LI-8150) with corresponding data processing notes.
  - Throughfall data handling: plot-level rainfall inferred from site rainfall via percent reduction; data gaps and occasional infilling documented.
  - Data quality notes: some legacy data processing practices not strictly aligned with current standards; some datasets not stored in the central data portal (EIDC) after June 2015; contact listed for data specifics.
  - Data accessibility: primary contacts for data access are Sabine Reinsch and Bridget Emmett at CEH Bangor; some datasets are stored outside EIDC; contact for details provided.

- Access, contacts, and documentation
  - Primary on-site data collection and management through CEH Bangor; on-going collaboration notes and dataset availability outlined.
  - Supporting documentation includes: dataset-specific RTFs and CSVs; site layout appendices; appendix materials for plot and quadrat arrangements.

- Endnotes and appendices
  - Appendix 1: Site and plot layouts; grid references and plot numbering.
  - Appendix 2: Quadrat layouts for vegetation surveys.
  - Site characteristics and climate data summarized in accompanying tables (e.g., temperature, rainfall, N deposition, soil properties).

- Key takeaway for environment-monitoring analysts
  - Climoor provides a comprehensive, multi-decadal, multi-domain data package combining meteorology, soil processes, plant physiology, and ecosystem carbon dynamics under controlled drought and warming treatments.
  - Data are rich for cross-domain analyses and integration, with clearly documented measurement protocols, conversion factors, and biomass adjustments, though some legacy data practices and storage gaps should be accounted for in data quality assessments.
  - For data access and integration inquiries, engage the CEH Bangor contacts and consult the supporting dataset docs and site layout appendices.
