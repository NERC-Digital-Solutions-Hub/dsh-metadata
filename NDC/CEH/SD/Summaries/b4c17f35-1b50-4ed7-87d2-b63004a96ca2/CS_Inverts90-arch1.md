# Headwater stream invertebrate data 1990 [Countryside Survey] Data Table Descriptions

- This document describes the data tables and collection methods for headwater stream macroinvertebrate data from 1990 within the Countryside Survey, © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Related guidance and reports to consult alongside this data:
  - Murphy, John; Weatherby, Anita. 2008 Countryside Survey. Freshwater Manual.
  - Dunbar, M. et al. 2010 Countryside Survey: Headwater Streams Report from 2007.
- Data collection and methods:
  - Macroinvertebrates sampled in 1990 using standard Countryside Survey protocols; sampling in a single stream-bed area (typically 5–15 m reach) with about 3 minutes of active sampling plus 1 minute of hand search.
  - Samples collected with a 1 mm mesh pond net and brought to CEH for sorting/identification; supplementary measurements (width, depth, substrate) gathered for RIVPACS.
  - Taxonomic identification and counting methods changed over time; harmonisation to a common modern taxonomy implemented to enable cross-year comparisons; standardisation performed to derive a mutually exclusive set of taxa for species richness calculations.
- Data entry and quality control:
  - Field data entered from paper sheets, then digitised into a database; cross-checked against original laboratory sheets with corrections applied for any data-entry errors.
- Data tables included:
  - STREAM_INV_SITE_90.csv (site-level data 1990):
    - Key fields include: YEAR, SQUARE (1 km square code), SITE_ID, SAMPLE_DATE, WATER_WIDTH, DEPTH1/2/3, SURF_VEL_CAT, CLARITY, SAMPLING_TIME, METHOD, substrate cover categories (ROCK_PAVEMT, BOULDER_COBBLE, PEBBLE_GRAVEL, SAND, SILT_CLAY), DOM_PART_SIZE (phi sediment score), MACROPHYTE_COVER, LC07/LC07_NUM (land classification 2007), EZ_DESC_07 (environmental zone), COUNTRY, COUNTY07.
  - STREAM_INV_SP_90.csv (species-level data 1990):
    - Key fields include: YEAR, SQUARE, SITE_ID, SAMPLE_DATE, SPECIES_CODE, NAME (scientific name), LC07/LC07_NUM, EZ_DESC_07, COUNTRY, COUNTY07.
- Taxonomy and data standardisation:
  - Harmonisation of species data to current taxonomy; standardisation ensures consistent species richness calculations across years.
