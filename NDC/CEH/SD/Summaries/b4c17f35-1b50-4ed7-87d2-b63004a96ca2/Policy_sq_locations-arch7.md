# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy governs access to CS survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and anonymity of site locations.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and continued access for surveys.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## When locations can be released and precision level
- For assessing whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone): can release approximate locations as four-digit grid references (identifies 10x10 km grid).
- For precise locations (six-digit grid references): only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing locations; otherwise, exceptional licensing required with strong justification.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitats, linear features) could indirectly reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are for finite periods and for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond that.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data remained secure and have been destroyed.
- No data or derivatives should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria; a clause prevents users from attempting to derive precise locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners outlining applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable demand; external requests are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
