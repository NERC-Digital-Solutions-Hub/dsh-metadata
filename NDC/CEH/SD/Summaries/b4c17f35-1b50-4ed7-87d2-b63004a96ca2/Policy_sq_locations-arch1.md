# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- This policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- All other Countryside Survey (CS) data remains publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include NERC (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve the representativeness of sampling sites and the goodwill of landowners.
- These elements are essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public interest supports confidentiality; requests are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations may be released (precision levels)
- Approximate locations can be identified by releasing 4-digit grid references (identifies the 10x10 km grid square) under licence.
- If precise needs arise, CEH can perform pre-processing to avoid releasing exact locations; otherwise, 6-digit grid references are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances under licence.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and thus are treated under the same exceptional terms as 6-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need for the project.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- At licence end, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same high IP confidentiality level.
- A clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from the data or to claim such derivation.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Licence agreements must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organization.
- If approval is denied, CEH will follow FOI/Regulations procedures to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe, subject to moderate demand.
- Requests from other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to using any data covered by this policy; CEH may support the work directly or via collaboration or payment, negotiated case-by-case.
