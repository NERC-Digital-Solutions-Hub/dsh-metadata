# Countryside Survey 2007: Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey

- National monitoring framework to identify environmental health measures for scrutinising and evaluating policy, informing future decisions.
- Focuses on freshwater environments across Great Britain, with standardized protocols to ensure data comparability over time.

## Scope and aims of the survey program

- Headwaters: re-survey of 425 CS2000 squares; macroinvertebrate community, River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology, physical characteristics, aquatic plant community, and water chemistry.
- Pond condition: mapping and condition assessment across CS2007 squares with ponds; one survey pond per square containing ponds.
- In CS2007, headwater sampling elements will be repeated for every square to enable nationwide assessment of headwater streams and ponds as part of Countryside Survey (CS) across GB.
- Pond surveys unify macrophyte (aquatic plants) data with environmental context and water chemistry to gauge pond condition and potential pressures.

## Key components and methodologies

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS): standardized 3-minute pond-net kick-sweep sampling with proportional habitat representation, plus mandatory manual searches; specimens preserved for laboratory analysis; data captured on RIVPACS Sample Area Form.
- Hydromorphology and river habitat (River Habitat Survey, RHS): 500 m reach centred on the macroinvertebrate sampling location; RHS data recorded via field tablet system (RAPID) aligned with the 2003 RHS protocol; includes spot-checks, flow, substrates, bank characteristics, vegetation, shading, and channel features.
- Aquatic plants and macrophytes (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR): 100 m reach surveyed for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent macrophytes; abundance estimated using a 9-tier cover scale; specimens collected or photographed for lab confirmation where necessary.
- Data capture systems:
  - RAPID: field data entry for RHS; validation checks on completion; 17 sections across 4 pages; on-site validation required.
  - IRIS: aquatic plant data entry for MTR; two-page form; validation checks; specimen labeling and submission workflow.
  - Field survey check-list: ensures completion of RHS macroinvertebrate sampling, plant survey, water quality, and mapping tasks before leaving site.
- Pond condition survey (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey):
  - Mapping and boundary identification; outer pond boundary defined by winter water level.
  - Photographs and sketch mapping to aid relocation; estimation of pond area and drawdown height; measurement of water depth and sediment depth at transects; assessment of sediment and pond base composition; evaluation of pollution, inflows/outflows, and pond management.
  - Water quality sampling: turbidity estimation; pH and conductivity measurements; filtered SRP, TON, alkalinity (50 ml filtrates); on-site filtration and bottle labeling protocol.
  - Surrounding land use and amenity context: two distance zones (0-5 m and 0-100 m) for land-use categories; evaluation of amenity value and public access.
  - Macrophyte survey in ponds: comprehensive inventory of wetland plants within pond boundary; abundance estimates; specimen handling guidance for rare or difficult taxa; identification protocols and lab confirmation pathways.
  - Documentation and sample transport: TREM (Transport Emergency Card) for fixatives; guidelines for courier to CEH Dorset; chain-of-custody for macroinvertebrate and plant samples.

## Data management and governance

- Standardised data collection to enable cross-year comparability and national-level assessment.
- On-site data validation and error correction via RAPID and IRIS to reduce data-entry errors and improve data quality.
- Centralised storage and processing workflow: macroinvertebrate samples and plant specimens consolidated and couriered to CEH facilities; specimens labeled and tracked with CS square and pond identifiers.
- Field teams employed are trained and certified in RHS, RIVPACS macroinvertebrate methods, and MTR plant surveys; teams rotated to maintain methodological consistency.
- Quality control: approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; field survey teams supported and supervised; data validation steps mandatory before leaving site.

## Practical workflow and operational considerations

- Coordinated field teams:
  - Designated A and B surveyors per headwater site; tasks allocated by seniority and skill (water sampling, RIVPACS environmental data, RHS, plant survey, etc.).
  - Safety assessments conducted at each site; avoidance of high-risk conditions; mobile signal checks advised.
- Sampling sequence and site logic:
  - Headwaters: macroinvertebrate sampling area (500 m), with aquatic plant survey centered around RHS spot-checks; combined data entered into RAPID.
  - Pond condition: survey pond identified via mapping sheet; full pond boundary surveyed; measurements and sampling conducted with attention to lake/pond hydrology and potential inflows/outflows.
- Documentation and relocation:
  - Photographs with marked markers to facilitate relocation by future surveyors.
  - Sketch maps and field notes emphasize permanent landmarks and grid references for repeatability.
- Sample handling and safety in transit:
  - Fixatives and sample pots securely labeled; TREM cards attached to transport containers; samples couriered to CEH Dorset; explicit guidance for volumes and container types.

## Particular challenges and considerations highlighted

- Data availability and metadata: extensive metadata and standardized field definitions are critical to ensure data quality and comparability; public sharing of underlying data is managed and governed to protect sensitive information.
- Access and silos: coordination across agencies and organisations to minimize data silos; field data governance and data-sharing procedures are essential to enable nationwide monitoring.
- Communication of complex findings: ensuring that environmental monitoring outputs (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR) are presented clearly to inform policy and management decisions; integration of multiple data streams (biological, chemical, physical) for holistic assessment.

## End goals and outputs

- Produce a coherent, policy-relevant assessment of freshwater environmental health across GB headwaters and ponds.
- Provide standardized, high-quality data suitable for informing future policy decisions, identifying data gaps, and guiding management and conservation actions.
- Deliver structured outputs (forms, digital datasets, maps, and lab-confirmed plant identifications) to contribute to Pond Conservation and CEH processing pipelines.
