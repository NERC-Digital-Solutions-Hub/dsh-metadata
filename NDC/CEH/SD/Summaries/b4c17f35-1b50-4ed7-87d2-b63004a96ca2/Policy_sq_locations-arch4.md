# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and continued landowner permission for surveys.
- Public-interest stance; FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations apply to requests.

## Access and release: levels of precision
- Data can indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone); four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing each square.
- Six-digit grid references require exceptional access; CEH can pre-process analyses to avoid releasing precise locations.
- Very exceptional cases may allow external release of location information if the requester demonstrates equivalent or higher IP confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data inside squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and limit access to authorized individuals for agreed purposes.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed after the license ends.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; cannot be used to plan visits or verify landowner compliance.
- Evidence of project management standards (at least JCOP-equivalent) may be required.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP-confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from released data.

## Roles and responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, decides on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with agreed terms, signed by authorized representatives.
- If access is denied, CEH supports the decision under UK Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing access applications and decision rationales.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS-partner use; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH involvement is possible via collaboration or payment.
