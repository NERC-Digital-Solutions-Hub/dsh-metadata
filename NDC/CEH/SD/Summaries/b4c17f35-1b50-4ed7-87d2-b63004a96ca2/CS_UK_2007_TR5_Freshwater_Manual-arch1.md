# Headwaters

- Purpose and scope
  - Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) headwater component surveys 425 GB squares previously sampled in CS2000, focusing on headwater streams and ponds.
  - Re-survey elements for headwaters: macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS), aquatic plant community, hydromorphological characteristics (River Habitat Survey, RHS), physical characteristics, and water chemistry; in randomly selected ponds within CS2007 squares, aquatic plant community, physical characteristics, and water chemistry are surveyed.
  - In 25 of the 425 squares a new headwater site on a smaller watercourse will replace a CS2000 site to better target headwater conditions.

- Survey framework and key concepts
  - Headwaters surveyed as a 500 m stretch per site; sampling area within the stretch is designed to maximize RHS and habitat representation.
  - 425 squares to be re-surveyed; 25 new headwater sites introduced to refocus sampling.
  - Data captured via field digital systems (RAPID for RHS, IRIS for aquatic plants) to improve quality and on-site validation; RIVPACS forms used for macroinvertebrate data.

- Site selection and sampling units
  - Headwaters: at each square, a 500 m watercourse stretch is sampled for macroinvertebrates, RHS data, water chemistry, and RHS site environmental data.
  - Ponds: in squares containing ponds (629 CS2007 squares with ponds), randomly selected ponds are surveyed for aquatic plant community, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Sampling is conducted by two freshwater surveyors (A and B) with prescribed roles and safety considerations.

- Data collection components and methods
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
    - Objective: maximize taxa collected from a single continuous sampling area (typically 5–15 m wide) within the 500 m stretch.
    - Method: three-minute kick-net sampling using a standard pond-net (25 cm x 25 cm, 900 µm mesh) plus one minute of manual searching; sampling area should represent habitat diversity but avoid mixing widely disparate habitats.
    - Manual search: two parts totaling one minute—surface dwellers first, then pick-off animals from submerged substrates and vegetation.
    - Sample handling: preserve in formalin (to reach ~4% final formaldehyde); label and store in pots/bags; avoid cross-contamination by thorough net cleaning; record on RIVPACS Sample Area Form.
    - Data recording: macroinvertebrate sample area data, site environmental data (width, depth, velocity category, substrate, etc.), and photographs for relocation.
  - Water chemistry
    - Field measurements: conductivity and pH (hand-held meter, calibrated).
    - Water sampling for SRP, TON, and alkalinity: on-site filtration through 0.45 µm syringe filters into 50 ml bottles; meticulous labeling and handling; samples sent to CEH Lancaster with appropriate paperwork.
  - Hydromorphology and RHS (River Habitat Survey)
    - 500 m RHS segment centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site where possible.
    - Data entry via RAPID on Tablet PC; 17 sections across 4 pages; spot-check data entered on Page 2; validation performed on-site with “Check Data” to ensure completeness.
    - If RHS cannot be completed at a square, the square should still be recorded with reason notes.
  - Photographs and relocation guidance
    - Photos required for macroinvertebrate sampling area, RHS reach, and MTR site; marker boards included in photos to aid relocation in future surveys.
  - Field data management and QA
    - RAPID and IRIS used to capture RHS and aquatic plant data; on-site validation and data checks; field survey checklists completed by both surveyors before leaving site.
    - Quality control includes certified RHS/RIVPACS training, team rotation, and approximately 7% headwater site audits by CEH staff.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS) data handling (RAPID)
  - 500 m RHS section, centered on the macroinvertebrate site; data entered via a structured, drop-down-driven form to minimize errors.
  - Page 1: field survey details, valley form, riffles/pools/point bars, artificial features.
  - Page 2: spot-checks (10) plus summary vegetation and substrate; each spot-check tab has a Check button to validate data.
  - Page 3 and 4: 500 m sweep-up data including land-use near banks, bank profiles, channel features, and dimensions.
  - Validation: on completion, the system prompts confirmation; data must be validated before leaving the site.
  - Output: RHS data stored in RAPID with on-site validation and later integration into CEH/Environment Agency datasets.

- Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR) and IRIS
  - Macrophyte survey in ponds uses the Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) framework with a 100 m reach to assess submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species.
  - Techniques include wading, grapnel use for submerged plants, and systematic 10 m segments to estimate species cover.
  - Species identification: aims for species-level IDs where possible; a standard list of ~351 taxa; collection and lab confirmation recommended for difficult groups (e.g., Ranunculus, Potamogeton, Callitriche, charophytes).
  - Rare species confirmation procedures and specimen handling (pressing, pickling) with clear lab submission guidelines.
  - IRIS data entry: aquatic plant survey data captured on a two-page IRIS form; if no plants are found, “NO SPECIES ENTERED” must be selected and physical data still captured.
  - Macrophyte data outputs include species list, abundance categories, and total submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent cover; shading over the pond area is also recorded.

- Pond condition survey (CS2007) – overview and procedures
  - Objective: identify ponds within each square, map boundaries, and select a “survey pond” for macrophyte, environmental characteristics, and water chemistry assessments.
  - Pond definition: standing water 25 m² to 2 ha, typically holding water for at least four months/year (including temporary ponds); boundary defined by winter water level.
  - Field workflow: mapping by mappers; pond boundary sketch; area estimation; drawdown height; percent water present; sediment and pond base composition; pollution assessment; inflows/outflows; pond management; grazing, waterbird and fish/ amphibian presence; surrounding land use; amenity value.
  - Pond condition surveying steps:
    1) Obtain survey pond from mapping sheet.
    2) Document GPS and pond identifiers; photograph the pond with square number.
    3) If water present, collect water chemistry sample and turbidity estimate before disturbance.
    4) Conduct environmental survey (amenity use) and macrophyte survey.
    5) Check and staple all field sheets; dispatch water samples and plant specimens per protocol.
    6) Ensure storage and dispatch of samples monthly with CEH Dorset.

  - Sampling and transport of pond materials
    - Strict labelling and packaging; formaldehyde-fixed macroinvertebrate samples transported with a Transport Emergency Card (TREM) and CEH dispatch procedures; plant specimens posted to CEH Dorset with appropriate labeling.
  - Quality control and safety in ponds
    - Two-person survey team; adherence to health and safety guidelines for water work; use of grapnels with caution to protect sensitive pond beds; skip ponds where safety risk is unacceptable.

- Labelling, sampling, and transport details
  - Thorough, robust labeling of all samples (internal and external) with CS square, pond or site identifiers, date, and collector names.
  - Use of TREM cards for transport hazards; monthly dispatch cadence to CEH Dorset for processing macroinvertebrate samples and plant specimens.

- References and training
  - Guidance references include Environment Agency RHS manuals (2003 version), Murray-Bligh 1999 methods for macroinvertebrate sampling, Holmes et al. 1999 MTR methodology, and Stewart 2004 macrophyte identification recommendations.
  - All field surveyors require Environment Agency RHS/RIVPACS certification; on-site training with RHS accreditation and data-entry training for RAPID and IRIS systems.

- Outputs and integration
  - Data integrated into national datasets via RAIDs: RIVPACS for macroinvertebrates, RHS-derived hydromorphological indices, MTR macrophyte data, and pond condition data.
  - On-site validation and standardized data formats facilitate cross-square comparability and long-term trend analysis.

- End-to-end workflow considerations
  - Begin with mapping and pond identification (for ponds) and establish macroinvertebrate sampling site aligned to RHS 500 m reach.
  - Collect macrophyte and water chemistry data in a coordinated sequence to minimize site disturbance and data inconsistency.
  - Use Tablet-based data entry (RAPID for RHS, IRIS for macrophytes) with built-in validation to ensure completeness before departure.
  - Ensure proper sample custody, labeling, and timely transport to CEH facilities; maintain strict QA and field-checklists to reduce data errors.

- Overall takeaway for analysts
  - CS2007 Headwaters provides a comprehensive, standardized framework for collecting, validating, and integrating multi-parameter freshwater data (biological, chemical, and physical) across GB headwaters.
  - It emphasizes robust field protocols, meticulous labeling and storage of samples, on-site data validation, and harmonized data entry to support reliable correlations, pattern detection, and predictive analysis at local to national scales.
