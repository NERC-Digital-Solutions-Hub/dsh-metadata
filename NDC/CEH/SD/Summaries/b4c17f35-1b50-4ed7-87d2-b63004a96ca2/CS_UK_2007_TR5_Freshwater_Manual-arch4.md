# Countryside Survey 2007 Headwaters

- Purpose and scope
  - National freshwater survey (CS2007) focusing on headwater streams, ponds, and associated habitats across GB.
  - Integrates macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey, RHS), aquatic plant surveys (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR), and pond condition assessments.
  - Aims to create a coherent data system: understanding data availability, gaps, and how data serve policy and management through a national dataset.

- Data collection framework and key components
  - Headwaters sampling plan
    - Re-survey 425 CS2000 squares for headwater streams: macroinvertebrate community, RHS hydromorphology, water chemistry, and environmental data.
    - Pond sampling: randomly selected ponds within 629 CS2007 squares containing ponds; surveys include aquatic plant community, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Data capture tools and workflow
    - RAPID: field digital system for River Habitat Survey (RHS) data entry, validation, and storage.
    - IRIS: field digital data entry for aquatic plant survey data (MTR-based).
    - On-site validation: data checks performed before leaving site; errors corrected iteratively.
    - Cross-system compatibility: RHS data in RAPID; macrophyte data in IRIS; integration with RIVPACS workflows.
  - Field teams and governance
    - Two freshwater surveyors per site (A and B) with distinct roles; distribution of duties adjusted by site conditions.
    - Regular QA: UK Environment Agency accreditation; ~7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; team rotation to maintain consistency.
    - Field survey checklists completed by both surveyors to ensure task completion.

- Key procedures and data elements
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
    - Sampling area: single continuous stream-bed area (5–15 m, depending on width) with proportional habitat sampling.
    - Methods: three-minute kick-net sampling plus one minute of manual searching; additional manual search of attached organisms.
    - Specimen handling: retain all samples for lab identification (except certain fish/amphibians/rare species returned to water); use formalin preservative for storage; lab analysis at CEH Dorset.
    - Environmental data: width, depth, substrate, velocity, and other habitat characteristics recorded for the sampling area; RIVPACS environmental variables captured.
    - Documentation: RIVPACS Sample Area Form (site, date, NGR, sampling method, proportionality, photo evidence, substrate, etc.); photos taken for relocation and site records.
  - Water chemistry
    - On-site measurements: conductivity and pH (field meters) for each headwater site.
    - Laboratory analyses: filtered samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity; detailed on-site filtration procedure and sample labeling.
  - Hydromorphology and aquatic plants (RHS, MTR, IRIS)
    - RHS (River Habitat Survey): 500 m sections centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site; spot-check data captured via RAPID; 10 spot-checks plus a ½-kilometer sweep-up; 3 pages of data entry with validation.
    - MTR (macrophyte survey): 100 m reach surveyed for aquatic macrophytes; cover estimates by species on a 9-point scale; wading and grapnel use for submerged plants; specimen collection for uncertain identifications; scoring includes submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent categories; thorough taxonomic guidance and rare species handling.
    - IRIS (aquatic plant data): online field data entry for plant species lists and cover; validation before submission; specimen handling and specimen ID sampling guidance.
  - Ponds (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey)
    - Pond mapping and boundary identification; pond area estimation; drawdown height; proportion of pond water present; sediment and pond base composition; pollution indicators; inflows/outflows; pond management, grazing, waterbird activity; surrounding land use and amenity value assessments.
    - Macrophyte survey within outer pond boundary (excluding terrestrial vegetation outside pond boundary); species identification to as fine a level as possible; abundance estimates by species using a dedicated abundance scale; recording of percent cover for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plants; recording of tree overhang.
    - Procedures for photographing ponds, sketching outlines, and documenting boundary delineation; guidelines for pace-based area estimation; drawdown measurement tools and methods.
  - Sample labeling, transport, and safety
    - Detailed labeling for all samples; use of PVC tape on lids; TREM transport card for formaldehyde-containing samples; monthly dispatch of samples to CEH Dorset; strict chain-of-custody and transport protocols.
    - Safety considerations emphasized for headwater and pond sampling (water depth, flow, access, weather, bank stability, livestock, etc.).

- Data quality, validation, and management
  - On-site validation and error correction
    - RAPID/IRIS include built-in validation routines; errors flagged one at a time; surveyors must correct and re-validate before leaving site.
  - Data consistency and audit
    - Regular training and accreditation; headwaters field survey checks; cross-team data consistency practices (team rotation and audits); approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff.
  - Data storage and handling
    - Samples stored at CEH base until shipment; standardized packaging and labeling; TREM cards attached to transport boxes; documentation and specimen handling guidance; post-survey submission procedures for field sheets and samples.

- Ponds and macrophyte-specific guidance
  - Pond definition and survey scope
    - Ponds defined as standing water from 25 m2 to 2 ha; ponds mapped in CS2007; survey pond selected per square with comprehensive data collection.
  - Macrophyte survey approach
    - Survey across entire pond boundary within outer winter water level; identification to species where possible; grapnel use for submerged plants; careful handling to minimize disturbance.
    - Abundance and cover estimation across submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent categories; percentage cover estimates guided by structured scoring (including a “no plants” option when appropriate).
  - Rare species and specimen handling
    - Special handling for rare or legally protected species; sampling and verifiable confirmation by experts when necessary; use of digital photography as a non-destructive confirmation method when possible.
  - Data integration and reporting
    - Macrophyte data linked to pond mapping and environmental data; standardized plant naming and taxonomic references; guidance for sending specimens to Pond Conservation for ID confirmation.

- Endnotes, references, and contact
  - References to Environment Agency RHS guidance (2003), MTR manual (Holmes et al., 1999), and related field manuals.
  - Contact points for sample submission and coordination with Pond Conservation and CEH staff.
  - Publication and reuse rights: CEH/NERC ownership with formal acknowledgement requirements.

- Practical takeaways for Data Leaders
  - Build a unified data ecosystem: integrate RHS, RIVPACS, MTR, and pond data into a common workflow with standardized fields and validations.
  - Prioritize data quality at the source: on-site validation, standardized labeling, and traceable sample handling to ensure data integrity downstream.
  - Leverage digital data capture: RAPID and IRIS reduce transcription errors and enable real-time validation and data quality checks.
  - Ensure governance and scalability: accredited teams, regular audits, cross-team training, and documented procedures to maintain consistency across large-scale field campaigns.
  - Design for reusability and future compatibility: consistent spatial units (CS squares, NGR), relocation aids (site photos, sketch maps), and versioned methodologies (RHS 2003 protocol) to maintain comparability across survey cycles.
