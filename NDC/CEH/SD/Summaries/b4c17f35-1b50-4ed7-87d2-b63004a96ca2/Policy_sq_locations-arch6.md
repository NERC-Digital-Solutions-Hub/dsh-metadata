# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Maximises public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserves representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and securing future permission to survey land.
- Public release could compromise future surveys and policy-relevance.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Location data can indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, IT Environment Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit precise locations require very exceptional circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release.
- Spatial data within survey squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at project end.
- No data or derived information may be shared with third parties that could compromise confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases are subject to similar terms but require less stringent IP confidentiality criteria; license must include a clause preventing identification of precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, decides on exceptional releases and issues licenses with appropriate clauses.
- Denied approvals follow UK FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS partner use; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners and prospective users are advised to consult CEH before officially committing to use data under this policy. Collaboration or fee-based support may be arranged as appropriate.
