# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Overview
  - Aims to maximise public-interest use of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

- Participating CS partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England (NE)
  - Welsh Government (WG)
  - The Scottish Government (SG)
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
  - Forestry Commission (FC)
  - Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
  - Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
  - Public-interest rationale; requests handled by CEH for NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- When and how locations may be released (and precision level)
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km area) may be released under licence to identify approximate square locations.
  - Six-digit grid references (more precise) are only in very exceptional circumstances; CEH must pre-process analysis to avoid release, unless an organisation demonstrates equal or higher IP confidentiality needs than CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality to six-digit locations and require the same exceptional terms.
  - Licences for four-digit releases differ from six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality standard.
  - Licensed data must not be used to pinpoint precise square locations or to plan visits to CS squares; no checking of individual landowner compliance.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end of the licensing period.
  - No data or derived outputs may be shared with third parties that could reveal square locations.
  - Data cannot be used to inform visits to CS squares or to assess landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to show project-management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
  - Four-digit releases have a license with terms to prevent attempts to derive precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and processes
  - CEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) makes exceptional-release decisions.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by an authorised representative of the licensee.
  - If an application is denied, CEH follows FOI/Regulations procedures in supporting its decision.
  - CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case consideration for requests from other organisations.
  - Partners and potential data users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may vary by collaboration or payment arrangements.

- Practical notes
  - Internal CS business use may require timely pre-processing analysis by CEH; moderate demand may be accommodated, higher demand evaluated case-by-case.
  - Consultation with CEH is recommended to define requirements and ensure appropriate data use.
