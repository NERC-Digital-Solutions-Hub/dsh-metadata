# Headwaters

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) focusing on freshwater headwaters across GB.
  - Re-survey of all 425 CS2000 squares; 25 squares include a new headwater sampling site to better target headwater streams.
  - In CS2007, headwaters assessment includes macroinvertebrate community, hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey, RHS), physical characteristics, and water chemistry; randomly selected ponds in CS2007 squares are also surveyed for aquatic plants and pond characteristics.
  - Aims to enable national-scale assessment of freshwater headwaters and provide data for cross-site comparisons and trend analysis.

- Study design and sampling framework
  - Headwater component covers 425 squares previously sampled in CS2000; each square contains a 500 m headwater sampling reach for RHS and macroinvertebrates.
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling uses a single continuous sampling area (5–15 m long) with proportional habitat sampling; typically 3 minutes of pond-net sampling plus 1 minute of manual search.
  - Water chemistry is collected as a single indicative sample per watercourse per square, with on-site filtration for SRP, TON, and alkalinity.
  - RHS (River Habitat Survey) portion records hydromorphological features over a 500 m reach, using 2003 RHS protocol and field data entered into RAPID.
  - Aquatic macrophyte surveys (MTR) are conducted for 100 m around the macroinvertebrate site to assess submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plants, plus shading.

- Data capture, tools, and workflow
  - Field data entry systems:
    - RIVPACS forms for macroinvertebrate sampling environmental data.
    - RAPID for River Habitat Survey data (on Tablet PC) with validation checks.
    - IRIS for aquatic plant data collection (MTR) in the field.
  - Data flow and validation:
    - On-site data entry with immediate validation; errors surfaced one at a time to ensure completeness before leaving the site.
    - All paper forms are designed to be digitized into central databases; validation reduces downstream data cleaning.
  - Site relocation and documentation:
    - Photographs, sketch maps, and site boards are used to relocate sampling sites in future surveys.
    - RIVPACS sample area form requires GPS coordinates (NGR), date, sampler initials, sampling method, water width, depth, substrate, habitats, and other environmental variables.

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
  - Sampling area: single continuous stream reach (5–15 m) representing major habitats; divide effort proportional to habitat cover.
  - Methods: standard 25 cm2 pond-net with 900 µm mesh; three-minute kick-sweep sample plus one-minute manual search; mandatory search for taxa not captured by netting.
  - Sample handling: wash net periodically to prevent clogging; retain organisms for lab identification; exclude fish/amphibians and readily identified large specimens; fix in 40% formalin to reach ~4% formaldehyde concentration.
  - Documentation: RIVPACS Sample Area Form records site details, sampling time, proportionality, photos, width/depth, substrate, habitat types, and water chemistry data.

- Water chemistry sampling and recording
  - Measurements at headwater sites: pH and conductivity in the field; filtered SRP, TON, and alkalinity in a 50 mL bottle after on-site filtration.
  - On-site filtration: use 0.45 µm syringe filters; follow standardized rinsing and labeling procedures to ensure traceability.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - 500 m RHS reach centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site where possible; data captured with RAPID.
  - Page structure includes field survey details, spot-check data, physical attributes, bank/top vegetation, channel features, and overall site characteristics.
  - Data entry features: drop-down lists to improve data quality; validation checks to ensure completeness.
  - If RHS cannot be completed at a square, sampling is still logged in RAPID with notes explaining the reason.

- Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR) and IRIS
  - 100 m macrophyte survey around the macroinvertebrate site; record presence and cover (9-point scale) for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plants; assess shading by overhanging vegetation.
  - Identification to species level where possible; field-based notes and specimen collection for lab confirmation when necessary; rare or vulnerable taxa require careful handling and possible expert confirmation.
  - Specimens for identification are bagged, labeled, and sent to appropriate laboratories; use of "No species entered" if none is found, while still recording physical habitat data.
  - IRIS interface for macrophyte data: add species, assign covers, manage specimens, and validate data on-site.

- Pond condition survey (CS2007)
  - Overview: mapping of ponds within each CS square by mappers; one survey pond per square selected for macrophyte, environmental characteristics, and water chemistry assessments.
  - Steps: photograph pond with square number, delineate outer boundary, sketch pond, estimate area, measure drawdown height, assess water presence, and complete fieldsheets.
  - Measurements and observations: turbidity estimation; water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity); sediment and pond base composition; inflows/outflows; pollution indicators; pond management; surrounding land use; amenity value.
  - Macrophyte survey: walk and wade accessible pond areas; graphically document species and abundance; collect specimens for difficult identifications; note rare species and potential species confirmation processes.
  - Data capture: CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets; include detailed environmental, macrophyte, and management data; requires transparent labeling and secure transport of samples to Pond Conservation.
  - Transport and QA: use Transport Emergency Card (TREM) for formaldehyde-containing samples; box samples for courier to CEH Dorset; monthly dispatch protocol; coordination with Pond Conservation.

- Quality control and assurance
  - All field surveyors hold Environment Agency certification for RHS and RIVPACS/macroinvertebrate techniques.
  - Regular team rotation to maintain consistent methods; audits of a subset of headwater sites by CEH staff.
  - Field survey check-lists completed collaboratively to ensure no tasks are missed.

- Deliverables and contacts
  - Field data collected across macroinvertebrates, RHS, macrophytes, and pond surveys feed into national datasets; samples are processed and stored at CEH bases with timely dispatch to processing laboratories.
  - Key contact points and references provided (CEH, Environment Agency manuals, and relevant photography and specimen handling guidelines).

- References and guidance
  - Environment Agency guidelines for River Habitat Survey (2003) and related manuals.
  - Core methodologies for RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling, MTR macrophyte survey, and field data capture systems (RAPID, IRIS).
  - Supplementary materials cover specimen handling, rare species confirmation, and identification keys for various aquatic taxa.
