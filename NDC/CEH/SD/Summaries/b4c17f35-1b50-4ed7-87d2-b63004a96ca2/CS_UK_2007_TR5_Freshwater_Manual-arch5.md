# Headwaters

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) focusing on headwater streams across 425 squares and integrated with pond assessments in CS2007.
  - Aims to re-survey headwater streams with standardized methods to assess macroinvertebrate communities, hydromorphology, water chemistry, and aquatic plants; data are entered in field systems for quality-controlled, shareable datasets.

- Data collection standards and governance (Data Steward perspective)
  - Use standardized, auditable field protocols to ensure datasets are interoperable, discoverable, and usable by others.
  - Clearly defined sampling areas, locations, and parameters to enable replication and comparability across sites and years.
  - Training and accreditation requirements to ensure consistent application of methods (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR/Macrophyte surveys, and chemical sampling).

- Data capture and validation workflow
  - Real-time field data entry with on-site validation to minimize errors (RAPID for River Habitat Survey; IRIS for aquatic plant data; RIVPACS forms for macroinvertebrate sampling; field checklists).
  - On-site data checks (Check Data) enforce completeness and internal consistency before leaving the site.
  - Data are compiled using standardized forms:
    - RIVPACS Sample Area Form: records site, date, GPS (NGR), sample method, sampling time, width/depth, substrate, habitat type, water chemistry, and photographs.
    - River Habitat Survey (RHS) data entered via RAPID on a Tablet PC: 17 sections across 4 pages, including spot-checks, physical attributes, bank features, channel vegetation, shading, and overall site characteristics.
    - Aquatic plant data captured with IRIS: 2-page entry for macroplant cover, species list, and physical site data; includes specimen handling and lab confirmation workflow.
  - Data quality audits include regular team rotations and approximately 7% site audits by CEH staff.

- Data systems and data flow
  - RAPID: field data entry and validation for RHS data; supports on-site data capture and immediate validation; designed to align with the 2003 RHS guidance.
  - IRIS: field data entry for aquatic macrophyte surveys; supports species lists, cover estimates, photography notes, and specimen management; includes validation and data export workflow.
  - RIVPACS forms: standardized macroinvertebrate sampling data capture in the field; includes sample area details, environmental variables, and water chemistry data.
  - Data export and transport: after collection, field teams physically transport macroinvertebrate and plant specimens to CEH Dorset; use Transport Emergency Cards (TREM) and standardized packaging; monthly courier dispatches when quantities reach threshold; specimens labeled with CS square/pond codes and date; samples linked to field records via unique square/pond identifiers.

- Key data elements and identifiers
  - Unique CS square identifiers and precise NGR coordinates (GPS) to locate sampling points.
  - Temporal data: date of sampling, with standardized formats.
  - Sample identifiers linked to RIVPACS, RHS, and IRIS datasets to ensure traceability from field to database.
  - Metadata on sampling methods, site characteristics, and environmental context to support comparability and retrospective analyses.
  - Photographs linked to sample areas and survey sections for site relocation and quality assurance.

- Data management of specific components
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
    - Sample area defined as a continuous stream-bed stretch (5–15 m typical), with proportional sampling across habitats.
    - Three-minute kick-net sampling plus one-minute manual search; arranges sampling to maximize taxa while avoiding over-sampling deep or inaccessible areas.
    - Samples fixed in 40% formalin to 4% formaldehyde equivalent and stored in labeled pots and storage containers; thorough net cleaning to avoid cross-contamination.
    - Environmental data (width, depth, velocity category, substrate, banks, vegetation, water chemistry) recorded on RIVPACS Sample Area Form.
    - Sketch maps and photographs required to aid relocation at future surveys.
  - Hydromorphology and habitat survey (RHS)
    - RHS protocol updated to 2003 version; data captured in RAPID; 500 m RHS reach centered on macroinvertebrate site; 10 spot-checks plus 50 m and 500 m sections; data validated in-field.
    - On-site data validation includes checks for missing fields and internal consistency; if RHS cannot be completed, square is still entered with date and survey notes explaining reason.
    - Data capture includes detailed environmental attributes, banking/vegetation, channel shading, and substrate composition; integrated with RAPID for validation and export.
  - Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR)
    - A 100 m reach surveyed for macrophyte presence and cover; wading or grapnel retrieval used depending on depth and safety.
    - Species identified to the extent possible; list includes guidance for difficult taxa and recommended specimen collection for confirmation (e.g., Callitriche, Potamogeton, Ranunculus, Myriophyllum, Charophytes).
    - Percentage cover estimated using a 9-point scale for each species; total macrophyte cover and shading quantified; specimens may be sent to experts for confirmation.
    - Nomenclature aligned to standard references; rare species flagged for possible confirmation; voucher specimens collected when necessary.
  - Pond-related data (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey)
    - Although primarily a pond-focused component, it integrates with the CS2007 headwaters program; includes pond mapping, boundary delineation, area estimation, drawdown height, turbidity assessment, water chemistry sampling, and environmental data collection.
    - Separate CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets and photo/documentation workflow; specimens and field notes shipped to Pond Conservation.

- Safety, risk, and governance considerations
  - Health and safety risk assessment for headwater sampling; sampling avoided if high/moderate risks are present; mobile signal noted as a practical contingency.
  - Safety procedures and required equipment documented (PPE, safety gear, GPS, wading aids, rescue equipment, etc.).
  - Governance and data stewardship emphasis on standardization, metadata, traceability, QA/audits, and clear data-sharing pathways to CEH and Pond Conservation.

- Challenges and considerations for data stewards
  - Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities across diverse field contexts.
  - Timely data access and data creators meeting metadata and standardization requirements.
  - Interoperability across many systems and formats (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR, IRIS, RAPID) and evolving field methods.
  - Handling large, multi-type datasets (macroinvertebrates, hydromorphology, chemistry, macrophytes) and ensuring long-term storage, curation, and accessibility.
  - Documentation of workflows, updating data schemas to remain compatible with legacy and new datasets, and ensuring consistent data quality across years.

- Pond condition survey: overview and workflow (context for Data Stewards)
  - Mapping of all ponds within a square; identification of a survey pond for macrophyte and environmental assessment when water is present.
  - Photo documentation, boundary delineation, pond area estimation, drawdown height, turbidity estimates, and two-stage data capture (field notes and field forms) with standardized lab shipping protocols.
  - Detailed plant identification workflow, specimen handling, and lab confirmation processes; strict labeling and archival procedures for plant and invertebrate samples.

- Endnotes and references
  - CS2007 integrates established methodologies (Environment Agency RHS guidance, MTR macrophyte protocol, RIVPACS macroinvertebrate methods) with field data capture tools (RAPID, IRIS) and standardized sample handling/transport procedures.
  - Documentation supports data traceability, comparability across years, and the potential for data sharing with external stakeholders (e.g., Pond Conservation).

- Implications for data management
  - Robust, paper-to-database lineage with on-site validation supports high data quality and reproducibility.
  - Standardized identifiers, GPS coordinates, and detailed metadata enable cross-site and cross-year analyses.
  - Clear data-sharing and archival pathways (monthly courier dispatch, CEH Dorset processing, open documentation and contact details) support data accessibility and governance.
