Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Sets confidentiality for survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, ensuring future surveys and scientific integrity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data are publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Rationale for confidentiality
  - Location confidentiality preserves representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill, essential for ongoing surveys and permission to survey land.
  - Public-interest justification; requests handled by CEH for NERC and CS partners under FOI Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Access levels and precision
  - Availability of approximate location: four-digit grid references released under licence (identifies 10x10 km grid).
  - Precise location data (six-digit grid references): released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may preprocess to avoid release if possible.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) can also imply square locations and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
  - Licences restrict use to agreed purposes; data must not be used to locate individual squares or to visit lands or assess landowner compliance.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end of the period.
  - No sharing with third parties that could compromise confidentiality; no attempts to derive exact locations from data.
  - If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit but less stringent IP confidentiality requirements; still prohibit attempts to identify precise locations.

- Licensing process and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with terms reflecting this policy.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under the relevant Act/Regulations.
  - CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - For internal CS partnership needs, CEH aims to provide preprocessing support within a reasonable timeframe; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.

- Roles and collaboration
  - CEH acts for NERC on exceptional releases; partners should consult CEH before using data covered by this policy.
  - Collaboration with CEH (scientific lead) is encouraged to define requirements and ensure appropriate use; involvement may be voluntary or paid and negotiated case-by-case.
