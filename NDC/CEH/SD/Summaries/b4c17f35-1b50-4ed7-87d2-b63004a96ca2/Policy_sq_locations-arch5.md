# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview and Scope
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Rationale for Confidentiality
- Location confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
- Protects ability to inform environmental policy in the future.

## Release of Location Data and Precision
- Access can reveal whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to indicate the square’s 10x10 km grid.
- If precise locations (six-digit grid references) are essential, CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release; very exceptional circumstances may allow external release under licence.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) could identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- All releases are governed by licensing, under which locations are treated confidentially and used only for specified purposes.

## Specific Conditions of Release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- Upon licence end, organisations must confirm destruction of location data.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality or be used to plan visits or verify landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same high IP-confidentiality criteria as six-digit releases.
- License terms for spatial data and four-digit references prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; approvals signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows legal procedures under relevant Acts and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; requests from external organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH may provide scientific guidance or collaboration, with potential payment negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical Guidance for Data Stewards
- Manage access requests via licensed agreements, ensuring confidentiality and security.
- Maintain documentation of licences, expiry dates, and destruction confirmations.
- Coordinate with CEH for pre-processing where possible to minimize data exposure.
- Include project-management standards references in licence terms when applicable.
- Encourage potential users to engage with CEH early to align on requirements and responsible use.
