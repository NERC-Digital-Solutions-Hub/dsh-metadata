# Cultural ecosystem services provided by cockles in Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland and the UK, 2018-2020

## Overview
- A dataset of scores (0–5) representing examples of cultural ecosystem services (CES) provided by cockles across Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, and the UK.
- Collected using an a priori framework during a face-to-face workshop in Vigo, Spain (10 April 2018) with 28 participants from 11 organisations, followed by country-specific meetings and communications.
- Part of the COCKLES project “Co-operation for restoring cockle shellfisheries and its ecosystem services in the Atlantic Area,” co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
- Dataset name: Cultural ecosystem services provided by cockles in Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland and the UK, 2018-2020.

## Data collection and framework
- Data collection followed an a priori framework aligned to established CES classifications (CICES v5.1) and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005).
- Process:
  - Each country documented CES examples in a provided template spreadsheet.
  - The first draft was circulated among participants to stimulate missing ideas.
  - A second round of country-specific meetings with representatives helped refine entries.
- Quality control:
  - Pilot testing of the template with one country, followed by revisions.
  - Ongoing checks for missing information during the workshop and subsequent bilateral activities.

## Data structure and scoring
- Data attributes follow a hierarchical classification:
  - Division: Indirect, Direct (from CICES v5.1)
  - Group: Intellectual/representative; Physical/experiential; Other non-use interactions; Spiritual, symbolic and other interactions with the environment
  - Class: Educational; Cultural heritage; Aesthetic; Recreation and ecotourism; Sense of place; Inspirational; Spiritual and religious
  - Sub-classes: 19 categories (e.g., History & archaeology, Education & Research, Cultural identity, Gastronomy, Imagery associated with cockle, Language, Folklore, Tourism, etc.)
- Scoring per country (Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, UK):
  - Scale 0–5 indicates the number of CES examples observed for each sub-class.
  - Non-linear mapping: 0 (no examples), 1 (one), 2 (two), 3 (three), 4 (four or five), 5 (six or more).
  - For Education & Research, the count of publications was re-scaled to 0–5 to align with other sub-classes.
- Data format:
  - File type: Excel workbook (noted as .cvs in the document, likely a typographical error).
  - Country-specific scores are captured for each sub-class.

## Quality control and provenance
- Staff responsible: Mathilde Jackson-Bué (as listed in the dataset details).
- Documentation and transparency:
  - The dataset records the collection workflow, including initial workshop, follow-up meetings, and country-level validation.
  - A priori framework and sub-class taxonomy reference established CES classifications (CICES v5.1; MEA 2005), enabling comparability and reproducibility.
- Data stewardship notes:
  - Data checking involved validating classifications, ensuring alignment with the framework, and identifying potential information gaps during the various meetings.

## Access, metadata, and usage
- The dataset is designed to be discoverable and usable by uploading with metadata to portals, enabling reuse and cross-study comparisons.
- Time period covered: 2018–2020, with initial in-person meeting in 2018 and subsequent country-specific follow-ups.
- Scope:
  - Cross-country comparison of CES examples associated with cockles across five European regions.
  - Enables analysis of which CES sub-classes are most represented, and how cultural values relate to different categories of ecosystem services.

## Practical considerations for analysts
- Potential analyses:
  - Compare country-level CES emphasis across sub-classes and groups (e.g., educational versus recreational values).
  - Investigate patterns by Division (Direct vs Indirect) and Group to understand how different types of CES are distributed.
  - Assess cross-country differences in the cultural value attributed to cockle fisheries and identify which sub-classes drive the most perceived CES.
- Considerations and limitations:
  - The scoring is based on the number of examples, which may be influenced by reporting effort and country-specific documentation practices.
  - The Education & Research sub-class required a publication-based re-scaling, which could affect cross-sub-class comparability.
  - Data are aggregated to country level; local-scale nuances may be lost.
  - Data collection spanned multiple formats and stages, so careful handling of metadata is essential for accurate interpretation.
- Data provenance and reproducibility:
  - Clear documentation of methods, framework references, and validation steps supports reproducibility and auditing of results.
