# Cultural ecosystem services provided by cockles in Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland and the UK, 2018-2020

## Overview and purpose
- Dataset records scores (0–5) for examples of cultural ecosystem services (CES) provided by cockles across five countries: Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, and the UK.
- Data collection occurred under the COCKLES project, co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), during 2018–2020.

## Data collection and methodology
- An a priori framework was used to classify CES examples.
- Primary data were gathered via a face-to-face workshop in Vigo, Spain (10 April 2018) with 28 participants from 11 organisations.
- Follow-up country-specific meetings were conducted by teleconference, video calls, and email.
- Each country documented CES examples in a template spreadsheet; the draft was circulated to participants to stimulate additional ideas.
- A second round of smaller, country-representative meetings followed to refine entries.
- Data collection involved participants with diverse backgrounds (natural and social scientists, government bodies).

## Classification framework and scoring
- CES classification follows established taxonomies:
  - Division: Indirect and Direct (from CICES v5.1)
  - Group: Intellectual and representative; Physical and experiential; Other non-use interactions; Spiritual, symbolic and other interactions
  - Class: Educational; Cultural heritage; Aesthetic; Recreation and ecotourism; Sense of place; Inspirational; Spiritual and religious
  - Sub-classes: 19 categories (e.g., History & archaeology; Education & Research; Knowledge & Informal Education; Cultural identity; Cultural practices; Gastronomy; Imagery associated with cockle; Language; Folklore; Symbolic; Ornamental uses; Recreational harvesting; Festivals; Tourism; Attachment to a special place; Art; Literature; Advertising; Spiritual to cockles)
- Scoring per country per sub-class:
  - A score of 0–5 reflects the number of CES examples observed, on a non-linear scale: 0 (none), 1 (sole example), 2 (two), 3 (three), 4 (four or five), 5 (six or more).
  - For Education & Research, the number of publications was re-scaled to fit the 0–5 scale to match other sub-classes.

## Data attributes and structure
- Division: Indirect or Direct
- Group: Four categories as above
- Class: Seven categories as above
- Sub-classes: 19 categories as above
- Country-specific entries: Scores for Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, and the UK
- Data type distinctions: Text for Division/Group/Class; numeric scores for country data
- Datasets capture the number of examples per sub-class, summarized per country

## Data quality control and validation
- The template was piloted with data from one country and revised to address classification difficulties.
- After initial drafting, the spreadsheet was distributed to participants to document country-specific CES examples within the framework.
- Examples were consolidated and checked for missing information during the Vigo workshop and subsequent in-country follow-ups.
