# Cultural ecosystem services provided by cockles in Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland and the UK, 2018-2020

- Overview
  - Dataset capturing scores (0–5) of cultural ecosystem services (CES) provided by cockles across five countries: Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, and the UK.
  - Data collected using an a priori framework during a face-to-face workshop in Vigo, Spain (10 April 2018) with 28 participants from 11 organisations, followed by country-specific virtual meetings and communications.
  - Part of the COCKLES project, co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), covering 2018–2020.

- Data collection and methodology
  - Coordinated by five-country collaboration with in-country expert and stakeholder teams; each country completed entries in a shared template spreadsheet and then circulated drafts to participants to stimulate additional ideas.
  - A second round of smaller, focused meetings followed the initial workshop.
  - Framework and classifications
    - CES classified within a priori framework aligned to: 
      - Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES v5.1) for divisions (Indirect/Direct) and groups (Intellectual/representative; Physical/experiential; Other non-use; Spiritual/symbolic).
      - Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005) for classes (seven categories) and sub-classes (19 categories).
  - Scoring approach
    - For each sub-class and country, a score from 0 to 5 was assigned based on the number of CES examples observed, with non-linear scaling: 0 (none), 1 (not used here, implied), 2 (two examples), 3 (three), 4 (four or five), 5 (six or more).
    - Education & Research sub-class used the number of publications re-scaled to fit the 0–5 scale (0–5).
  - Quality control and data checks
    - The initial template spreadsheet was piloted and revised to improve assignment of examples to classes.
    - Data were collated from country teams and checked for completeness during the workshop and subsequent bilateral follow-ups.
  - Data formats
    - File format: Excel workbook (noted as .cvs in the text).

- Data attributes and structure
  - Division: Indirect and Direct (from CICES v5.1).
  - Group: Four categories—Intellectual and representative; Physical and experiential; Other non-use interactions; Spiritual, symbolic and other interactions with the environment.
  - Class: Seven categories (Educational; Cultural heritage; Aesthetic; Recreation and ecotourism; Sense of place; Inspirational; Spiritual and religious).
  - Sub-classes: Nineteen categories (e.g., History & archaeology; Education & Research; Knowledge & Informal Education; Cultural identity; Cultural practices; Gastronomy; Imagery associated with cockle; Language; Folklore; Symbolic; Ornamental uses; Recreational harvesting; (seafood) Festivals; Tourism; Attachment to a special place; Art; Literature; Advertising; Spiritual to cockles specifically).
  - Country scores
    - Countries involved: Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, United Kingdom.
    - For each sub-class, each country has a non-linear 0–5 score representing the number of examples observed (Education & Research adjusted via publication counts to align with other sub-classes).
  - Practical details
    - Each country entered data into the provided template; Education & Research specifically re-scaled to match the others.
    - Descriptions and numeric values are category-specific (Division, Group, Class, Sub-classes) and country-specific.

- Geographic and temporal scope
  - Geographic scope: Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, United Kingdom.
  - Temporal scope: Data collection and activities conducted during 2018–2020, beginning with the Vigo workshop in April 2018 and continuing through follow-up country activities.

- Project and provenance
  - Staff responsible for dataset entry: Mathilde Jackson-Bué.
  - Project context: COCKLES — Co-operation for restoring cockle shellfisheries and its ecosystem services in the Atlantic Area.
  - Funding: European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a structured, cross-country approach to measuring CES using established classifications (CICES v5.1; MEA 2005).
  - Shows a practical workflow for monitoring framework data: stakeholder-inclusive design, a priori framework, standardized scoring, and iterative quality checks.
  - Highlights the value of a harmonized template for comparability across countries and CES sub-classes.
  - Notes the need for clear documentation of data collection processes and the potential for data gaps, as well as the importance of data quality and transformation steps when aggregating cross-country CES data.
