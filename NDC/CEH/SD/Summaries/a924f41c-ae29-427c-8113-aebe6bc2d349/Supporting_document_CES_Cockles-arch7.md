# Cultural ecosystem services provided by cockles in Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland and the UK, 2018-2020

## Overview
- Dataset of cultural ecosystem services (CES) scores for cockles across Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, and the UK.
- CES captured as scores from 0 to 5, indicating the number of examples per sub-class.
- Collected through an a priori framework during a Vigo workshop (10 April 2018) with 28 participants from 11 organisations, followed by country-specific virtual meetings and emails.
- Part of the COCKLES project co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

## What the data covers
- Basic description: number of CES examples for each sub-class in each country, on a 0–5 scale.

## Data collection and process
- Staff responsible: Mathilde Jackson-Bué.
- Method: framework-based data collection via a face-to-face workshop and subsequent virtual meetings with in-country expert/stakeholder teams; each country completed entries in a provided template spreadsheet.
- Iteration: first draft circulated to participants to stimulate additional ideas; second round of country-specific meetings to address gaps.
- Location/timeframe: Vigo, Spain (10 April 2018) with follow-up country meetings by teleconference, video, and email.
- Countries involved: France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom.
- Data validation: pilot testing of the template with one country; revisions to accommodate classification difficulties; ongoing checks for missing information during workshop and follow-ups.

## Data structure and classification
- Type of data: CES examples classified into major classes and sub-classes of CES guided by CICES v5.1 (indirect/direct divisions) and MEA (seven classes; 19 sub-classes).
- Scoring scheme: for each sub-class and country, a non-linear scale from 0 to 5 based on the number of examples (0 = none; 2 = 2 examples; 3 = 3; 4 = 4–5; 5 = 6 or more). Education & Research uses a publications-based re-scaling to 0–5 to align with other sub-classes.
- Attributes:
  - Division: Indirect, Direct.
  - Group: Intellectual/representative; Physical/experiential; Other non-use interactions; Spiritual/symbolic/other interactions with the environment.
  - Class: Educational; Cultural heritage; Aesthetic; Recreation and ecotourism; Sense of place; Inspirational; Spiritual and religious.
  - Sub-classes: 19 categories (e.g., History & archaeology; Education & Research; Knowledge & Informal Education; Cultural identity; Cultural practices; Gastronomy; Imagery associated with cockle; Language; Folklore; Symbolic; Ornamental uses; Recreational harvesting; Festivals; Tourism; Attachment to a special place; Art; Literature; Advertising; Spiritual to cockles).
  - Country-specific scores: Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, UK; numeric values per sub-class (Education & Research re-scaling noted).
- Output format: results organized per country with scores across sub-classes.

## Data formats
- Primary file format: Excel workbook (noted as .cvs in the description; intended likely as .csv or .xlsx).
