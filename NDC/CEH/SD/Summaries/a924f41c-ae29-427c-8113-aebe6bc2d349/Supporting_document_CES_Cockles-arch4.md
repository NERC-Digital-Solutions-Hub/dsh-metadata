# Cultural ecosystem services provided by cockles in Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland and the UK, 2018-2020

- A multi-country dataset capturing scores (0 to 5) for examples of cultural ecosystem services (CES) provided by cockles across Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, and the UK.
- Collected 2018–2020 as part of the COCKLES project, co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), through a combination of an initial in-person workshop and subsequent country-specific follow-ups.

## Purpose and scope

- Documents CES examples classified within a common framework to quantify cultural benefits provided by cockles.
- Uses an a priori framework based on CICES v5.1 and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) for classification.
- Includes 19 sub-classes across seven classes, mapped to four groups and two divisions (Indirect and Direct) of CES.

## Data collection process

- Initial face-to-face workshop in Vigo, Spain (April 10, 2018) with 28 participants from 11 organisations across five countries (France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, UK).
- Follow-up through smaller country-specific meetings conducted via teleconference/video call and email.
- Countries contributed by documenting CES examples in a shared template spreadsheet, which was then circulated to stimulate additional ideas.
- A second round of targeted follow-ups with representatives further refined the data.

## Dataset structure and attributes

- Division: Indirect and Direct (adapted from CICES v5.1).
- Group: Four categories (Intellectual and representative; Physical and experiential; Other non-use interactions; Spiritual, symbolic and other interactions with the environment).
- Class: Seven categories (Educational; Cultural heritage; Aesthetic; Recreation and ecotourism; Sense of place; Inspirational; Spiritual and religious).
- Sub-classes: Nineteen categories (e.g., History & archaeology, Education & Research, Knowledge & Informal Education, Cultural identity, Cultural practices, Gastronomy, Imagery associated with cockle, Language, Folklore, Symbolic, Ornamental uses, Recreational harvesting, Festivals, Tourism, Attachment to a special place, Art, Literature, Advertising, Spiritual to cockles specifically).
- Country-specific scores: For each sub-class, a country-specific score 0–5 is assigned based on the number of examples (0 = none; 1 = one; 2 = two; 3 = three; 4 = four or five; 5 = six or more). Education & Research had its publication counts re-scaled to 0–5 to align with other sub-classes.
- Scaling notes: Scores use non-linear scaling (0, 2, 3, 4, 5) for most countries; Education & Research uses publication-based re-scaling.
- File format: Excel workbook (with a note that the format appears as .cvs in the documentation).

## Data quality, checks, and governance

- The a priori framework and template were piloted and revised to improve alignment of CES examples to the classification.
- Data were checked during the workshop and through bilateral follow-ups to identify missing information and ensure consistency across countries.
- Efforts aimed to ensure data suitability, completeness, and alignment with the CES framework and scoring scheme.

## Project context and collaboration

- Part of the COCKLES project: Co-operation for restoring cockle shellfisheries and its ecosystem services in the Atlantic Area.
- Collaborative effort across five countries (France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, UK) involving natural and social scientists and government bodies.
- Data collection and documentation supported by a cross-country process to stimulate comprehensive, comparable CES reporting and enable potential visualization and further analysis.

## End use and potential applications

- Enables comparative analysis of cultural ecosystem services provided by cockles across countries.
- Supports research, policy, and industry discussions around the cultural value of shellfisheries and associated ecosystem services.
- The standardized framework and scoring facilitate integration with other CES datasets and potential dissemination within the wider data community.
