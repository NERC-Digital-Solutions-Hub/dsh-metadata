# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The document outlines the sampling framework for Countryside Survey field work, focusing on how the ITE Land Classification has been developed and applied from 1978 through 2007, and how sampling design evolved to support country-specific reporting and upland habitat estimates.

## Core idea and purpose
- Use a stratified, random sampling framework based on the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative ecological sampling across Great Britain.
- Link sampling design to changing policy and reporting needs (e.g., separate England, Scotland, Wales estimates; Wales-only reporting; upland habitat estimation).

## The ITE Land Classification: basis for sampling
- Stratification is essential to reduce bias and ensure representative sampling across ecological variation.
- The ITE Land Classification classifies land into discrete environmental strata using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- Early method: classify 1 km squares (GB has many squares); use center of a 15 × 15 km grid for initial classification, with four surrounding squares allocated to each class to reflect local variability.
- Inductive development: 32 original Land Classes (1970s), with descriptions tied to environmental characteristics.

## Survey history and sampling framework

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
  - Use ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) to derive 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 center squares (1 km²), plus four surrounding squares per center.
  - Total squares classified: ~6,039 km²-equivalents across GB.
  - Sampling: 8 squares per Land Class (total 256 squares).
  - National habitat-area estimates: derived as mean habitat area per square in a class multiplied by the land-class area.

- 1984 – Second field survey
  - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - Results published later (landscape change focus).

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) using All Squares Land Classification
  - Shift toward including all GB squares; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; extended data collection to all prior features plus repeat vegetation quadrats.
  - Land Classification revised to allow full-square coverage; some squares reclassified.

- 1998–2000 – Developments to CS2000
  - Recognition that the previously used classification caused some class under-representation; need for regional (England, Scotland, Wales) reporting.
  - The Land Classification was extended to classify every square, using major climatic/geological/physiographic surrogates and various classification procedures.
  - Outcome included separate country estimates and a framework that produced 40 strata (versus 32).
  - Additional sampling: 19 squares added to ensure representation of new classes; 11 more squares to balance England and Wales sampling; Isle of Man samples replaced (IOM squares moved to England); introduction of an uplands module for better upland habitat estimation.

- 2007 – Developments for CS2007 (Welsh-only reporting)
  - Wales-specific reporting continued to grow in importance after devolution.
  - Wales had previously been the most intensively sampled region but still under-represented for Wales-only estimates.
  - Adjustments:
    - Land Classes subdivided into England-and-Wales country-unit versions, creating five new Welsh/England-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
    - England: no accompanying increase; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained at 4 squares per class (deemed acceptable for reporting purposes).
  - Wales sampling numbers increased substantially (e.g., Wales squares rose from 64 in CS2000 to 107 in CS2007).
  - The CS2007 sampling map and corresponding table illustrate the revised distribution of squares and strata.

## Key numbers and structure changes over time
- Land Classes
  - 1978: 32 Land Classes; primary stratification framework.
  - 1990: Land Classification revised to incorporate all GB squares; urban/sea corrections; still used the 32-class framework with adjustments.
  - 2000: Expanded to 40 classes to accommodate country reporting (England, Scotland, Wales); new divisions to support country-unit estimates.
  - 2007: Further subdivision to 45 strata to enable Wales-only reporting; introduction of country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
- Sample sizes (Squares surveyed)
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares.
  - CS2000: 569 squares.
  - CS2007: 591 squares.
- Country coverage
  - Initially England, Scotland, Wales had mixed representation; subsequent changes created explicit country units.
  - Wales-specific sampling expanded from 64 squares (CS2000) to 107 squares (CS2007).
  - Isle of Man sampling removed from country-unit estimates and replaced by new English squares in later cycles.
- Upland module
  - CS2000 introduced a dedicated uplands module adding 30 squares to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Data use and estimation approach
- National estimates calculated by combining class-level statistics (e.g., mean habitat area per square) with the spatial extent of each Land Class.
- Shifts in Land Classification affected cross-survey consistency; the preferred approach for within-survey consistency uses the latest classification, while cross-survey consistency favored the original (1990) system.
- The evolution toward country-unit classifications and Wales-specific sub-classes enhances policy-relevant reporting and supports country-specific environmental policies.
