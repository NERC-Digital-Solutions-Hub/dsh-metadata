# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

- Purpose and scope
  - Government/ITE initiative to update land-use and land-cover datasets for Britain, integrating top-down remote sensing with ground-truth field surveys.
  - Emphasizes standardization, repeatability, and long-term monitoring of rural vegetation, land use, and landscape features.
  - A two-tier approach: ground truthing using the ITE Land Classification System to support broader landscape modelling and change detection over time.

- Data governance, standards, and quality
  - Establishes a field data handbook and standardized data collection procedures to ensure consistency across observers and years.
  - Promotes data quality control, notably through standardized field recording (FAB), clearly defined codes, and permanent plot markers to enable reliable relocation in future surveys.
  - Emphasizes metadata, clear definitions, and documentation of exceptions or uncertainties to support reproducibility and data provenance.
  - Acknowledges the need to standardize recording across observers to minimize variation and improve statistical accuracy of change data.

- Study design and sampling
  - Survey of 512 sites (squares) divided into six groups, with six teams (one per ITE Research Station) each handling about 85 squares.
  - Each square planned for approximately three days of surveying; travel-based logistics prioritized to minimize inefficiencies and overtime.
  - Sub-sampling elements include: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; permanent markers and related documentation support long-term repeatability.
  - Among the sampling: large vegetation quadrats (200 m2), nested smaller quadrats, and multiple linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) to capture habitat mosaics and boundary features.
  - Additional small quadrats and targeted semi-natural land cover types are included to broaden habitat representation.

- Equipment, data collection tools, and field procedures
  - Equipment: FAB field assessment booklets, aerial photos, maps, color pens, survey poles, measuring tapes, field clips, cameras, and permanent marker plates.
  - Data forms (FAB) structure
    - Maps and data codes for each square, with primary and secondary codes to describe land cover, boundaries, ownership, vegetation, and management.
    - Sections for Ownership/Landowner information, Farmer/Landowner information, Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Woodlands/Forestry, Boundaries, Buildings/Structures/Communications, and other thematic categories.
  - Data capture and coding
    - Use of numeric codes and alpha codes to compress and standardize data entry, with strict rules on code order, dominant codes, and avoidance of ambiguity.
    - Guidelines for handling mosaics, edge boundaries, and situations where field interpretation must prevail.
    - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) as a supplementary guide to identify features not on maps, with specific conventions for marking on copies of maps and field use.
  - Plot layout and relocation
    - Permanent markers (metal plates) placed to allow reliable relocation; plots fixed in relation to boundaries, field features, and cardinal directions.
    - Detailed relocation rules for when land use changes or when previous plots no longer fit the habitat, including randomization when appropriate and documentation of changes.
  - Vegetation sampling (6.2)
    - Standardized methods for recording vegetation across multiple plot sizes, including large 200 m2 quadrats, nested smaller quadrats, and linear plots.
    - Standardized recording sheets with a header, species list, cover estimates (5% increments), and space for notes and sketches.
    - Field procedures for laying out plots, relocating from previous surveys, and ensuring consistent centering on habitat types.
  - Species identification and taxonomy
    - Encourages species-level recording where possible, but accepts documented species combinations for difficult identifications to maintain consistency with past surveys.
    - A defined list of common species (including crops, grasses, forbs, and bryophytes) to streamline data entry; unlisted species recorded as needed.
  - Photographs
    - Photography of vegetation plots to capture landscape context and key features; plot numbers clearly displayed.
  - Data management and post-survey procedures
    - End-of-day data checks to minimize omissions; return of FABs and samples to ITE Stations promptly.
    - Procedures for data transfer and archival to maintain a traceable data lineage.

- Permissions, access, and stakeholder engagement
  - Recognizes the need to obtain permissions from landowners/farmers to access all parts of each square.
  - Pre-survey communication includes letters informing owners of the survey and expected visits; coordinators to verify access on site.
  - Clear escalation if permission is refused:
    - If access denied for all parts of a square, abandon and replace with a new square.
    - If partial denial, determine whether remaining accessible areas can still be surveyed.
  - Emphasizes engaging with the farmer/landowner for background information and cooperation, and documenting ownership details and contact information.

- Data outputs, reuse, and long-term value
  - The collected data (mapping, quadrats, vegetation species, and boundary/ownership information) are designed to feed into:
    - Land cover mapping and landscape classification over time.
    - Trend analysis to identify changes in rural environments and ecological conditions.
    - Linking field data with satellite-derived land cover for enhanced bottom-up/top-down integration.
  - Emphasizes the importance of documenting methodology and maintaining a consistent data record to support future resurvey efforts and cross-year comparability.

- Particular considerations and challenges for data stewardship
  - Variability in user needs and interpretation can limit dataset completeness; standardized procedures help mitigate this.
  - Timely access to field sites and consistent metadata (ownership, permissions) are essential for schedule adherence.
  - Handling multiple systems, codes, and field formats across observers requires rigorous governance and ongoing training.
  - Large-scale data collection (512 squares across the country) necessitates robust archival, documentation, and replication capabilities to ensure long-term usability.

- End note
  - The handbook compiles detailed procedures and coding conventions to standardize the Countryside Survey 1990 data collection, aiming to produce high-quality, shareable, and reusable datasets for monitoring changes in Britain’s rural environment.
