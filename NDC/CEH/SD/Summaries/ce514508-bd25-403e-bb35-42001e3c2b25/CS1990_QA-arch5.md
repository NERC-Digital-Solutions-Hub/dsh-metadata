# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Purpose and Scope
- Assess the accuracy and reliability of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey.
- Explain differences in recording accuracy in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, and other factors.
- Relate findings to previous comparative work and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.
- Focus areas include vegetation data, plot relocation, landuse mapping, and vegetation cover estimation.

## QA Methodology
- Two separate QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares assessed using sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors evaluated each plot type.
  - 1991: Expanded QA using photographs of individual plots; single 1 km square from each terrain class; sequences of self-assessment and re-survey in near-dates.
- Plot types examined (six total):
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X-plots) and 4 m2 (Y-plots)
  - Linear plots: 1 × 0 m (roadverges)
  - Hedges
  - Streamsides
  - Boundaries
- Plot relocation methods included locating buried plates, matching from sketch maps, and using photographs and metal detectors.
- Data collection focused on landcover and boundary features at nine predetermined points within a square.
- Analytical framework used multiple concordance indices (e.g., % agreement, common species, and accuracy measures) to compare Time 1 (T1) and Time 2 (T2) data.
- Annexes and tables provide detailed breakdowns of species concordance, sources of error, and code usage.

## Key Findings on Data Quality and Observations
- Species concordance and recording accuracy:
  - Autumn 1990 QA showed overall concordance around 60.9% (± variation by plot type); after excluding certain seasonal differences, improvements aligned with prior ecological studies (Kirby et al. 1986).
  - A broader 1990 QA analysis indicated an initial mean species count per plot around 22.7–23.0, with notable variations by plot type and landclass.
  - The 1991 QA (with photographs) demonstrated a highly significant increase in recorded species per plot (1990: ~20.7; 1991: ~23.4), suggesting real ecological changes plus improved recording efficiency.
- Observed sources of variation:
  - Mis-identifications and mis-codings (A)
  - Species overlooked in original surveys (B)
  - Overzealous recording and boundary/plot misalignment (C, D, G, H)
  - Seasonal and annual effects (F)
  - Management changes and crop rotations affecting species presence (E)
  - Plot relocation and orientation mismatches (G, H, I)
- Plot relocation and plate recovery:
  - Plate relocation success in autumn 1990: about 71% recovered within five minutes; 34% were found with a second assessor, improving to ~65% plate/87% plot recovery in later phases.
  - Photographs substantially improved relocation accuracy, especially for plots in unenclosed land; small Y-plots remained challenging.
- Plot-type and landclass differences:
  - X plots (exact quadrats) yielded better relocation and higher accuracy than other types.
  - Enclosed versus unenclosed plots showed differential accuracy; upland (UP) landclasses generally yielded more stable axis scores and lower seasonal effects than lowland (LC, LG, MA).
  - Lowland arable (LC) areas exhibited comparatively poorer recording accuracy, possibly due to greater species diversity and short-term flux.
- Vegetation cover estimates:
  - Visual cover estimates were compared for species present in both surveys, with significant differences for some species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Urtica dioica) but overall concordance remained reasonable for dominant species.
  - The reliability of cover data varied by species and landclass; bryophytes and certain grasses contributed disproportionately to mismatches.
- Species frequency and groups:
  - Frequencies of prevalent species showed some year-to-year changes (some genuine population shifts; others likely due to climatic variation and sampling differences).
  - No significant difference in cumulative frequency for broader species groups between the original survey and 1991 QA, though some individual species showed notable changes.
- Landuse mapping and boundary coding:
  - Primary landuse codes were highly reliable (roughly 88% concordance overall); boundary codes showed good agreement but were more variable due to the involvement of multiple assessors and re-surveying.
  - Boundary and landuse codes were influenced by interpretive choices in the field handbook; some codes (e.g., marsh, upland classifications) required refinement.
  - Coordinates and point-location mappings demonstrated high accuracy for lowland areas but greater variability in upland, unenclosed areas.
- Mapping of species cover and vegetation units:
  - Agreement on dominant species at mapped grid points remained moderate; concordance for more complex co-dominant combinations was low.
  - The mapping exercise highlighted the value of focusing on the most prevalent species and limiting the number of fine-grained qualifiers to improve reproducibility.

## Data Quality Implications and Recommendations
- Recommendation 1: Retain lichens in general surveys with training and habitat information; expand species samples during training for better identification.
- Recommendation 2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the original survey time to minimize seasonal and ecological changes affecting comparisons.
- Recommendation 3: Require annotating photographs and linking them to the plot location; photographs should show key ground features for relocalization.
- Recommendation 4: Use metal marker plates for all plots where feasible to aid relocation in enclosed and unenclosed areas; recognize that relocation in high-elevation unenclosed areas is time-consuming.
- Recommendation 5: Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with survey tape and orient so the side rather than the diagonal is aligned N-S; place plots at the SE corner; photographically anchor their position.
- Recommendation 8–12 (mapping and landuse):
  - Subdivide upland grassland codes and add new codes for specific vegetation types (e.g., lowland rush pasture, wet heath) to reduce ambiguity.
  - Recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type and assign a primary code accordingly.
  - Limit primary boundary codes to hedge presence, with species composition captured via qualifying codes.
  - Simplify landuse mapping by recording only the most prevalent species for vegetation mapping to improve reproducibility.
  - Increase emphasis on dominant species and reduce reliance on exhaustive cover codes to improve consistency.
- Recommendation 12: Focus mapping on the two most prevalent species per land parcel to enhance reproducibility.
- Additional practice recommendations:
  - Training should emphasize bryophyte recording, vegetative identification of grasses, and distinguishing similar taxa.
  - QA should be conducted within the same year as the original survey when possible to minimize seasonal and annual discrepancies.
  - Photographs should include clear contextual references (distances, bearings, nearby features) to improve relocation efficiency, especially in unenclosed areas.
  - Provide explicit rules for recording tree and shrub cover to improve analytical consistency.

## Implications for Data Governance and Data Stewardship
- Data provenance and metadata:
  - Capture detailed metadata for each data point, including plot type, date(s), season, observers, method (sketch vs. photo), plate IDs, and relocation success.
  - Document versioning of codes (landuse, boundary, and vegetation) and any methodological changes between surveys.
- Data quality controls:
  - Implement standardized QA protocols tied to the data collection window (same-year QA where possible).
  - Maintain audit trails for changes in codes, classifications, and mapping decisions.
- Coding standards and interoperability:
  - Harmonize landuse and boundary coding schemes to reduce interpretive variability, with explicit guidance on ambiguous cases.
  - Consider a simplified or hierarchical code structure to improve consistency across teams and time periods.
  - Align with broader vegetation classifications (e.g., National Vegetation Classification) by clarifying bryophyte inclusion and habitat-specific codes.
- Data structure and sharing:
  - Provide raw plot data and QA-processed datasets with clear documentation on changes, reasons for discrepancies, and confidence levels.
  - Include Annex-style documentation (form templates, field handbooks, and data dictionaries) to facilitate reuse and interoperability.
- Training and capacity building:
  - Establish ongoing training focused on identity of common species, cover estimation conventions, and accurate plot relocation techniques.
  - Include practical exercises with photographs, sketch maps, and marker plates to reinforce consistent methodologies.

## Conclusion
- The Quality Assurance exercises demonstrate that large-scale ecological field surveys benefit substantially from photographic relocation, standardized plotting, and rigorous metadata practices.
- Key improvements for future surveys include enhanced relocation aids (plates, photographs with context), refined landuse and vegetation codes, and a stronger emphasis on dominant species for mapping.
- For data stewards, implementing close-in-time QA, robust documentation, consistent coding standards, and metadata-rich datasets will enhance data quality, discoverability, and reusability across datasets and projects.
