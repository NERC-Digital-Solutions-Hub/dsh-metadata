# Countryside Survey 1990 Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview
- A Quality Assurance (QA) exercise for the 1990 Countryside Survey to measure consistency, reliability, and accuracy of field recording across a large, multi-operator field program.
- Aimed to quantify observer error, seasonality effects, plot relocation issues, data quality of vegetation records, and land-use mapping accuracy.
- Compared QA results with previous surveys and provided recommendations to improve future survey methods and data products.

## Aims
- Quantify accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey and the reliability of derived change statistics.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, seasonality, plot location, information type, and regional factors such as drought.
- Relate QA findings to previous comparable work (ITE surveys).
- Recommend methodological changes to enhance accuracy and confidence in future statistics and data products.

## Methods
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 of the original survey squares; relocation relied on original sketch maps.
  - 1991: Expanded to include photographs of individual plots to improve relocation; included a self-assessment component.
- Plot types included: 200 m² X-plots, 4 m² Y-plots, 1–10 m linear plots, road verges, hedges, streamsides, and boundaries.
- Relocation approaches: sketch maps, photographs, and metal plates; assessment of plate/plot relocation success.
- Data assessed: species lists, relative cover estimates, land-use/class mapping codes, and boundary features; comparisons used multiple concordance metrics and analyses (e.g., DECORANA, t-tests, Wilcoxon tests).

## Key Findings
- Species recording concordance and data quality
  - Overall species list agreement between original survey and QA 1990/1991: about 60.9% (Table 4), with earlier autumn QA around 45%.
  - 1991 QA (with photographs) markedly improved data recording efficiency: initial efficiency of recording average ~74% (Table 6, para 25).
  - Seasonal and drought effects: significant portion of differences attributed to seasonal variation and drought between 1990 and 1991, especially for common and ecologically variable taxa.
  - Across plot types, large apparent changes in species composition could reflect both real ecological shifts and recording discrepancies; some increases in species numbers from 1990 to 1991 were attributed largely to real differences in growing season and seasonality rather than assessor inexperience alone.
- Plot relocation and plate/plot accessibility
  - Plate relocation recovery: 71% for plates and 87% for plots (autumn 1990 and 1991 combined), indicating substantial but imperfect relocatability within limited search times.
  - Use of photographs greatly aided relocation accuracy, especially for plots defined by precise ground positions; Y-plots were notably challenging to relocate.
- Cover estimates and bryophyte considerations
  - Comparison of cover values for select species showed some significant differences between 1990 and 1991, but patterns varied by landclass and plot type.
  - Bryophytes and certain grasses were under-recorded or inconsistently recorded; recommendations emphasize including bryophytes more consistently and improving grass identification during training and QA.
- Land-use and boundary mapping
  - Primary land-use code concordance was high (approximately 88–89%), indicating reliable mapping of major habitat/crop types.
  - Boundary code concordance was lower (around 80–83%), influenced by qualifying codes and interpretive differences; issues included hedges vs. hedges with different densities and the use of undefined forb-cover codes.
  - Mapping of land-use boundaries and accompanying descriptive codes showed substantial but imperfect consistency across surveyors and time.
- Mapping of species cover and vegetation units
  - At fixed grid points, concordance for dominant species showed reasonable stability (e.g., 81% for first species at a point), but co-dominant species had much lower concordance (about 34%), highlighting challenges in multi-species dominance typing.
  - Recommendations suggest recording only the two most prevalent species per land-use parcel to improve reproducibility.
- DECORANA and ecological gradient insights
  - DECORANA first-axis analyses across plot types indicated a broad gradient from shade-intolerant to shade-tolerant assemblages, with upland areas (UP) showing distinct and stable vegetation; observed axis shifts from 1990 to 1991 were in line with wider ecological trend expectations but varied by landclass and plot type.
  - Across time periods, there was evidence of an overall ecological shift consistent with earlier ECOLUC findings, though year-to-year variation and drought effects complicate simple trend interpretation.
- Recommendations for data collection, coding, and training
  - Recording and identifying bryophytes should be enhanced; include more specimen/habitat information in training.
  - QA should be conducted as close as practical to the initial survey time; same-year QA preferred to minimize seasonal/annual variation.
  - Use metal marker plates to aid precise plot relocation; allocate extra resources for relocation in unenclosed upland areas.
  - Improve Y-plots positioning protocols; annotate photographs with clear ground context and nearby features; ensure photographs tie to precise sketch locations.
  - Expand and refine land-use coding (see Recommendations 8–12); subdivide certain upland codes and recognize wide heaths and rush pastures as distinct types.
  - Limit and standardize the use of cover codes; map only the most prevalent species for reproducibility; use simpler, dichotomous mapping schemes where feasible.

## Data Practice and Governance Implications (Archetype: Data Leaders)
- Standardization and documentation
  - The QA underlines the need for robust, unambiguous data standards, especially for species identification, cover estimation, and land-use coding.
  - Explicit, shared field handbook guidelines and training to reduce interpretation variance across assessors.
- Metadata, provenance, and versioning
  - Emphasizes the importance of linking QA results to field methods, dates, plot types, and observer pairs to understand data lineage and error sources.
- Data quality metrics
  - Highlights multiple metrics (percentage agreement, accuracy, frequency changes) to monitor data quality over time; supports implementing routine QA metrics in data workflows.
- Data usability, reproducibility, and mapping practices
  - Recommends simplifying mapping schemas (e.g., focusing on the two most prevalent species per land parcel) to enhance reproducibility and cross-study comparability.
  - Encourages annotation and annotation-coupled photography as standard practice to improve plot relocation and data traceability.
- Practical workflow guidance
  - Align QA timing with field surveys; use photographs and plates to reduce relocation errors; standardize near-term re-surveys for robust change detection.
  - Invest in targeted training on grasses and bryophytes, as well as on distinguishing similar taxa that frequently cause misidentifications.
  - Consider developing habitat-specific QA plans and codes to minimize interpretive variability in complex habitats (bogs, moors, rush-dominated wetlands).

## Conclusions
- The 1990 Countryside Survey QA demonstrated substantial but improvable data quality issues in large-scale ecological fieldwork.
- Incorporating photographs, standardized markers, and tighter training substantially improved data reliability, though seasonal and drought effects remained a major source of variation.
- For future surveys, aligning QA with the original survey timing, refining land-use and boundary codes, focusing on dominant species in mapping, and enhancing bryophyte and grass identification are strategically important to improve data quality, comparability, and usefulness for policy and research.
