# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Overview
- Documents the development and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes the need for a representative, stratified sampling design to track habitat change across Great Britain and to enable time-series analyses.
- Tracks how classifications and sampling on a GB-wide basis evolved to support country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and upland analyses.

## Core concepts
- Stratified, random sampling: to minimise bias by ensuring samples reflect the diversity of land types and ecological processes.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to create land classes, which serve as the strata for sampling.
- 1 km square sampling units: chosen as the primary field survey units, surveyed within a single field season.
- Link to time-series: earlier classifications and sample allocations are retained to maintain comparability across CS surveys.

## Development timeline and key milestones
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey)
  - Use Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on environmental attributes to create 32 land classes from 1,228 centre squares of a 15 × 15 km grid (plus surrounding squares).
  - Developed a stratified, random sample: eight samples per land class (total 256 squares) for national habitat estimates.
  - Outputs supported national estimates of habitat areas via mean habitat area per square in each class.
- 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
  - Expanded sampling to 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; urban and sea corrections added.
  - Surveyed 508 squares; repeated key measurements from 1984 plus 1984 quadrats.
  - National estimates produced using the revised 1990 Land Classification.
- 1998–2000 (Revised Land Classification & 4th Field Survey / CS2000)
  - Extension of the Land Classification to enable separate reporting for Scotland, with the number of land classes increased to 40.
  - For CS2000, revised sampling to support country-specific estimates: subdivision of classes into England with Wales and Scotland versions; aggregation of under-represented classes within countries; added 19–30 new squares to ensure adequate representation across new classes; upland habitat module introduced.
  - Wales required more representative sampling due to devolution; adjustments increased Wales’ sample intensity relative to other nations.
- 2007 (Revised Land Classification & 5th Field Survey / CS2007)
  - Welsh-only reporting requirements driven further refinements: creation of five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Additional Welsh squares: 43 extra squares to ensure minimum representation (6 squares per new Welsh class); England adjustments to compensate for Welsh additions (some English classes reduced to 4 squares).
  - England, Scotland, Wales survey allocations updated to reflect country-specific needs and devolution context.

## Sampling framework details by period
- 1978 CS: 256 total 1 km squares; 32 land classes; eight samples per class; focus on vegetation quadrats and soils.
- 1984 CS: 384 squares; same stratified approach; increased sample density within classes.
- 1990 CS: all GB squares reclassified; 508 squares surveyed; included urban/sea corrections; continued time-series continuity with prior data.
- CS2000 (England, Wales, Scotland reporting): introduced separate country estimates; land classes subdivided into country-specific versions; added upland module with 30 extra squares in upland classes; overall sample size increased with additional country-specific allocations.
- CS2007: Wales-specific reporting matured; further subdivision into country-unit classes; total sampling rate adjustments to maintain precision across England, Wales, and Scotland; final counts show CS2007 England/Yorkshire and Wales/Scotland allocations across multiple land classes.

## Country-specific adaptations and upland focus
- Separate country estimates: England with Wales and Scotland were reported separately; adjustments included class subdivisions, aggregations, and additional squares to ensure adequate representation per country.
- Wales emphasis: explicit Wales-only reporting needs led to new Welsh country-unit classes and targeted additional sampling to maintain precision.
- Upland habitat module (CS2000): added 30 squares allocated to upland and marginal upland land classes to improve habitat estimates in upland regions.

## Outputs, maps, and data use
- Land Classification maps updated to reflect new country-unit classifications (e.g., Figure 4 for England-with-Wales and Scotland in CS2000; Figure 6 for CS2007).
- Tables summarise the number of squares surveyed by class and country and provide sampling rate metrics (e.g., Table 2, Table 3 in CS2007).
- National estimates based on class proportions and areas, with explicit notes on classification changes and their impact on cross-survey consistency.
- Data and outputs used to inform biodiversity and habitat policy assessments, land-use planning, and environmental reporting (e.g., Countryside Survey 1990 main report; CS2000 and CS2007 UK results reports).

## Notes on consistency and interpretation
- Changing Land Classification across surveys affects cross-survey consistency of national stock estimates; preference is given to using the latest classification for country estimates, while the original 1990 classification offers cross-survey consistency.
- Tables provide guidance on how sample sizes per class evolved under different classifications (e.g., original 1990 vs. latest classifications).
