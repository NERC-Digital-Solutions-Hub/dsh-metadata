# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- The document describes the evolution and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey fieldwork up to 2007.
- It explains how GIS-ready data products (map-based habitat/land-use information) are produced from stratified, random sampling of 1 km squares across Great Britain, tied to evolving land classification schemes.

## Core concepts

- ITE Land Classification
  - A stratification system based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to classify land into distinct classes.
  - Used to ensure samples are representative and coverage across different land types is balanced.
  - Classes have evolved from 32 (1978) to 40 (1990) to 45 (2000), with further country-unit refinements (England with Wales, Scotland, Wales) in later years.
- Stratified, random sampling
  - Aims to minimize bias by dividing GB into strata (land classes) and sampling within each class.
  - Early approach used a center 1 km square with surrounding squares to define a class-wide sample.

## Evolution timeline (key milestones)

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
  - 32 land classes derived from 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid).
  - Sampling: 8 squares per class, total 256 squares for GB.
  - Output: national habitat area estimates by class mean area per square multiplied by class area.

- 1984 – Second field survey
  - Still used the original Land Classification; expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total).
  - Purpose: broaden the data basis for landscape change.

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
  - Land Classification updated to include data from all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - Output: field data plus habitat mapping; introduced the need for broader geographic coverage.

- 1998–2000 – Developments leading to CS2000
  - Recognition that every GB square could benefit from classification; major surrogates (climate, geology, physiography) used to extend classification.
  - 40 land classes implemented to support regional/local estimates; introduced separate country estimates.
  - Adjustments to sampling to enable England/Wales and Scotland-specific reporting; 19 additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes; Isle of Man dropped; Wales designated a larger sampling focus.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting driving further adjustments.
  - Wales subdivided Land Classes into country-unit versions (creating five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares allocated to ensure minimum representation (6 squares per Welsh class); adjustments in some English classes due to Welsh allocations.
  - Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country unit; England/Scotland sampling adjusted accordingly.
  - An upland module was included to improve upland habitat estimates (additional 30 squares placed in upland classes).

## Sampling framework details

- Sample unit and layout
  - Core unit: 1 km squares, drawn from a stratified grid based on Land Classes.
  - Initial approach involved identifying a center square and four surrounding squares per class (totaling the classified set).
- Country-unit framing
  - From CS2000 onward, estimates were adapted for country units: England with Wales, Scotland, and separately Wales for policy and legislative needs.
  - Sub-division and aggregation of Land Classes created 40 strata for country-level estimates, later expanded to 45 with Wales-specific subdivisions.
- Sample counts and distribution (high-level)
  - CS2000: expanded to support England & Wales and Scotland estimates; England & Wales totals and class distributions detailed (varied by class and country).
  - CS2007: further adjustments to ensure Wales-specific representation; Wales received additional Welsh-class subdivisions and extra sample squares.
- Upland module (CS2000)
  - Added 30 squares to improve statistical accuracy of upland habitat estimates.

## Data products and GIS implications

- Map-based outputs
  - Land Classification maps for each survey year (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007) underpin habitat and land-use maps.
  - Sample square distributions are mapped to show spatial coverage and representativeness.
- Cross-survey compatibility
  - Revisions to Land Classification affect comparability; recent classifications are preferred for national estimates, but older classifications may be used for cross-survey consistency.
  - The document emphasizes translation of class definitions across survey years to support temporal change detection.
- Spatial scales and granularity
  - Primary spatial unit is 1 km squares; analyses build national/regional estimates by aggregating square-level data across Land Classes.
  - The approach enables GIS users to create stratified layers, derive class areas, and compute vegetation/habitat statistics at multiple geographic scales.
- Policy and stakeholder relevance
  - Wales-only and England-with-Wales estimates support country-specific environmental policies and reporting requirements.
  - Upland habitat data and updated Wales subdivisions improve policy-relevant accuracy.

## National estimates and consistency

- Methodological notes
  - The 2006 scoping study highlighted that changing the underlying Land Classification affects consistency of national stock estimates.
  - For internal consistency, it is preferred to use the latest classification for country-specific estimates, while cross-survey consistency may argue for the original classification in some contexts.
- Tables and references
  - The document includes detailed tables comparing sample sizes and strata across survey years and country units (e.g., Table 4), illustrating the evolution of sampling intensity and class representation.
