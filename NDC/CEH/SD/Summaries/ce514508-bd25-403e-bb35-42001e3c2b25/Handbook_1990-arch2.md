# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Purpose and scope
- Monitor and document changes in Britain's countryside to evaluate environmental health and land-use change over time.
- Build current, standardized datasets to support scientific evaluation, model ecological changes, and link ground-truth data with satellite imagery for national land-cover mapping.
- Use a two-tier approach: bottom-up field surveys (ITE Land Classification System) complemented by top-down remote sensing to improve projection and pattern detection.

## Who conducts the survey
- Teams from six ITE Research Stations, each responsible for a subset of survey squares.
- Aims to standardize data collection across observers to ensure consistency and comparability over time.

## Key outputs and formats
- Spatial and attribute data stored in Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and mapped to 1:10,000 scale aerial maps.
- Outputs include detailed maps, charts, and coded vegetation and land-cover data suitable for trend analyses and policy evaluation.
- Data quality is prioritized through standardized field handbooks, observer training, and explicit recording rules.

## Planning and logistics
- Sample design: 512 squares total; six groups managed by ITE Stations; approximately 85 squares per team.
- Schedule emphasizes flexibility and travel efficiency; no overtime payments initially (time off in lieu for large overtime accumulations).
- Budget and logistics guide travel patterns (local travel, short- and mid-term relocations) to minimize returns to sites.

## Equipment and field tools
- Provided by Merlewood: FABs, aerial photographs, maps, field handouts, weatherproof clipboards, pens, survey poles, markers, sampling gear, tapes, navigation aids, and identity cards.
- Local station contributions supplement maps, reference books, cameras, field gear, and personal equipment.

## Field procedures (high-level)
- On arrival: quick site reconnaissance, assess access and potential problems, seek permission for full square access.
- Plan a suitable route to cover the entire square, then review records for omissions and ensure clear presentation.
- Obtain and document permissions; if permissions are refused, follow coordinated procedures to reallocate or abandon the square as needed.

## Data recording and mapping (FAB)
- The survey comprises three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; sampling details are in Section 7.
- FABs are central: must be neat, complete with square numbers on every page, and carefully linked to maps and aerials.
- Ownership and farmer/landowner information are recorded, with a formal system to rate cooperativeness for introductions and access planning.
- Aerial photograph interpretation (API) may guide feature identification and boundary delineation but ground truth remains decisive.

## Mapping conventions and coding (6.1)
- Annotate 1:10,000 maps with coded data; use box-coded primary and secondary codes to compress complex information (e.g., boundary types, land cover, vegetation types).
- Boundaries must be clearly marked; codes exist for actual vs. interpreted boundaries (e.g., “no longer present”).
- Minimum mappable units and length thresholds guide what is mapped; certain non-vegetation features use cross marks.
- Aerial photograph interpretation (API) aids identification of features not on maps but is subordinate to ground evidence.

## Field workbook and filling guidelines (6.1.2)
- FABs must be completed neatly; essential to record square numbers consistently, ownership, and detailed notes.
- When using codes, prioritize dominant primary codes and link codes logically (e.g., a boundary followed by a boundary-type code).
- Colour coding is allowed for complex in-field recording; markers and symbols should minimize later transcription ambiguity.

## Vegetation and plot methodology (sections 6.2.x)
- General method: standardized vegetation recording across plots with a strong emphasis on consistency and repeatability.
- Plot types:
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 squares per square, positioned to capture major habitat types.
  - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m quadrats in different semi-natural land-cover types per square.
  - Boundary, hedgerow, streamside, and roadside linear plots (up to five each per square) to capture linear vegetation patterns.
  - Boundary, hedgerow, streamside, and roadside linear plots have specific location rules relative to dominant features.
- Location and relocation:
  - Where possible, relocate existing plots to matching coordinates; if land use has changed, adapt location by boundary proximity or designate a nearby suitable habitat.
- Laying out and recording:
  - Quadrats are centered within habitats, with diagonal strings and polar orientation to ensure consistent plotting.
  - Permanent markers (metal plates) placed for relocation; field sketches and photography document plot positions.
  - For arable plots, crop edges are used to approximate plot location when necessary.
- API and field decisions:
  - API-derived guidance is used when ground truth conflicts with aerial interpretations; end-of-API guidance remains advisory.
- Species identification:
  - A predefined list of common species (with acceptable combinations where identification is difficult) supports consistent identification to species level where possible.
  - Bryophytes and lichens are recorded from a restricted list; some difficult identifications may be grouped into acceptable combinations.

## Data recording details (vegetation data)
- A nested-quadrat approach records species presence and percent cover (5% bands) across multiple nested scales within each plot.
- For each plot, a master list of species is completed first, followed by a final cover assessment for species with 5% or more cover.
- A sketch of plot layout, coordinates, and permanent markers accompanies each FAB.

## Sampling (Section 7)
- Freshwater biota: Two freshwater samples per square (one from flowing water via IFE protocol; one from standing water via NELUP protocol) with standardized bottle labeling and handling for transport to Merlewood.
- Standing waters types and habitat representation are chosen to reflect square characteristics (lakes/lochs, ponds, dried pools, flushes, bogs, etc.).

## Photography and post-survey procedures
- Photography: Every vegetation plot photographed to document appearance and landmark context; plot number displayed on a board at plot edge.
- End-of-day checks: Review FABs for omissions; avoid post-hoc transcriptions unless damage necessitates it; transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

## Particular challenges and aims for analysts
- Increase the value of datasets by integrating with other data sources (beyond single-use applications).
- Enhance data accessibility for others to maximize reuse and cross-analysis potential.
- Maintain data quality through standardization, training, and clear documentation to support long-term environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
