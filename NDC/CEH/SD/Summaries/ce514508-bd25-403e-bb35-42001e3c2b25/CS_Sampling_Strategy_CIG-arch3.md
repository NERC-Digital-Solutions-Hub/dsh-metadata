# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- This document outlines the historical development and methodology of the Countryside Survey field sampling framework, tied to the ITE Land Classification, used to produce national habitat estimates for Great Britain and its countries.

## Core concepts and purpose

- The sampling framework is built on the ITE Land Classification, developed over about 30 years, to stratify GB land into discrete classes for representative sampling.
- Sampling units are 1 km squares, with an emphasis on stratified random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representation of different ecological conditions and land uses.
- National estimates are derived by combining grassland/habitat statistics from sampled squares with the known area of each Land Class.
- Early work used a center-square approach (the 1 km square at the middle of a 15 x 15 km grid) plus surrounding squares to define a class, enabling a manageable, repeatable framework for large-scale ecological surveys.

## Timeline and evolution of the sampling strategy

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and first field survey
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 land classes from environmental variables across 1228 centre squares; four surrounding squares per centre classified as well (total 6039 km squares).
  - Sampling aimed for 8 squares per Land Class (256 total), surveyed in a single field season.
  - National habitat estimates computed as the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.

- 1984 – Second field survey
  - Emphasis shifted to land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping; 12 squares per Land Class were surveyed (total 384).
  - The analysis continued to rely on the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates; increased sample size but not reallocated by class size.

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) and “All Squares” Land Classification
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; urban and sea corrections added.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats from 1978 and added land cover mapping (first GB Land Cover Map from satellite imagery).
  - National estimates based on the 1990 Land Classification; some squares changed class, but results retained for policy relevance.

- 1998–2000 – Developments toward CS2000
  - Recognition that regional/local estimates required an extended Land Classification and consistent country-level reporting (England, Scotland, Wales).
  - Land Classification expanded to enable separate country estimates; 40 strata created through sub-division and aggregation of classes; additional squares allocated to ensure representation of new/adjusted classes.
  - Separate country estimates introduced: England & Wales, and Scotland, with class sub-divisions tailored to each country; Isle of Man adjustments noted (Man squares replaced with England squares in some schemes).
  - A Wales upland sampling module was added to improve habitat estimates in uplands, funded by DETR/MAFF/WO/CCW.
  - Summary of CS2000 sampling: total GB squares per class adjusted to reflect new country-focused strata; 30–59 squares per class for various classes, with Wales receiving targeted increases in several classes.

- 2007 – Developments for CS2007 (Welsh reporting and broader Wales-focused refinement)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further class sub-divisions, creating five new Wales-specific classes and increasing the total strata to 45.
  - Wales gained 43 additional squares for Wales representation (minimum 6 squares per new Welsh class); some English classes (5e, 15e) reduced to 4 squares per class but deemed acceptable by scoping studies.
  - England did not receive extra squares to compensate for Welsh additions; class-level precision considerations acknowledged.

## Country-specific and upland considerations

- Separate country estimates became a core objective to meet policy and legislation needs in England, Wales, and Scotland.
- Wales required additional Welsh-class subdivisions (Welsh country units) and targeted sampling to ensure Wales-specific precision.
- An uplands module added to CS2000 and CS2007 improved habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

## Data structure, reporting, and comparability

- The classification system has evolved, which affects comparability across surveys. There is a tension between using the latest Land Classification for consistency with current policy needs vs maintaining cross-survey comparability using the original 1990 (or earlier) classification.
- The document notes that, for GB consistency, estimates can be calculated using either the latest classification or the original; the 2006 scoping study recommends using the latest classification for a given survey while acknowledging cross-survey comparability considerations. Table 4 in the document presents the numbers of squares by class across versions.

## Outputs and references

- CS1990 Main Report and subsequent CS1990-related publications established methodologies for national estimates.
- CS2000 and CS2007 produced country-specific UK results (with CS2007 explicitly providing Wales-only reporting) and detailed sampling allocations by Land Class and country unit.
- Additional references include methodological papers on the ITE Land Classification, stratification approaches, and guidance on country-specific environmental reporting.
