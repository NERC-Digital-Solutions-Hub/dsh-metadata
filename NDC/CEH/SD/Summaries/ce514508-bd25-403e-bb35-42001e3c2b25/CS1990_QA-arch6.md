# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- Documents the scope, results, and recommendations from quality assurance (QA) of the 1990 Countryside Survey.
- Aims to quantify accuracy of field recording, explain differences due to observers, timing, location and information type, relate findings to previous work, and propose methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Background
- Field surveys with many recorders inherently vary; QA and training aim to measure consistency and reliability across major field components.
- Prior QA exercises (1989, autumn 1990) highlighted issues such as patchy data, observer bias, and the need to assess relocation, species recognition, and data formats.

## Aims
- (a) Quantify the accuracy of field recording and the accuracy of change statistics.
- (b) Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, and information type, including drought and regional factors.
- (c) Relate QA conclusions to previous comparative work on ITE surveys.
- (d) Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics.

## Methods
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares; relied on original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors performed evaluations.
  - 1991: Added photographs of plots; expanded to include one 1 km square from each of the 32 terrain classes; included self-assessment of some squares.
- Plot types and relocation:
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X plots) and 4 m2 (Y plots).
  - Linear plots include road verges; hedges; streamsides; boundaries; enclosed land boundaries near X plots; relocation used sketch maps, photographs, and metal detector for buried corner plates.
  - Nine predetermined points within a quarter of each square recorded landcover and boundary features.
- Key performance measures:
  - Plate/plot relocation success rates.
  - Species concordance indices (four variants: simple agreement, common vs total, etc.).
  - Overall accuracy and “initial efficiency of recording.”
  - Analysis of seasonal, locational, and plot-type effects on data consistency.
- Data scope:
  - Comparisons across time (1990 vs 1991 QA), across plot types and landclasses (lowland vs upland), and across primary land-use codes and boundary/cover classifications.
  
## Key Findings

### Accuracy and error sources
- Overall concordance (between time periods) around 60.9%; initial accuracy for 1990 survey around 58–74%, depending on adjustment for seasonal and location factors.
- Major sources of variation:
  - Mis-identifications or mis-codings.
  - Species overlooked at T1 (original survey).
  - Plot mis-location or mis-orientation at T2.
  - Seasonal effects and management changes (e.g., crop changes, herbicide use).
  - Graphical relocation challenges especially for smaller plots (notably Y plots).
- By 1991 QA, there was a statistically significant increase in mean species per plot, largely reflecting real seasonal differences and better recording efficiency rather than mere observer bias.
- Initial efficiency (accuracy) of recording in 1990 averaged around mid-60s percent, with improvements seen in 1991 after training and feedback; some variability remained depending on landclass and plot type.

### Plot types and relocation
- X plots (larger quadrats) more reliably relocated than Y plots (smaller quadrats); road verges and hedges relatively easier to relocate; Y plots were the hardest.
- Photographs substantially improved relocation accuracy; metal plates helped with relocation in enclosed land but were time-consuming in unenclosed uplands.
- Recommendation: annotate photographs and relate them to plot coordinates; use metal markers where feasible; improve positioning protocols for small plots (Y plots).

### Species recording and change statistics
- Seasonality and drought strongly affected species lists; 1991 generally showed more species per plot than 1990, with a portion attributed to genuine ecological changes and a portion to improved detection.
- Frequency analyses for common species showed some apparent changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana communis) likely driven by climate year differences rather than survey error alone.
- Some species were consistently over- or under-recorded across periods; bryophyte and grass species were particularly involved in misclassification or inconsistent identification.
- DECORANA (ordination) analyses indicated axis shifts consistent with land-use changes, with upland areas showing persistent gradients and lowland areas showing climate-related fluctuations.

### Mapping and land-use coding
- Primary land-use codes were generally reliable (roughly 88–89% concordance in some comparisons); boundary coding showed slightly lower concordance due to interpretive differences in hedges vs boundaries.
- Ambiguities arose with certain codes (e.g., marsh/wetland, moorland vs blanket bog) and with boundary/forb cover coding.
- Recommendations to improve coding:
  - Sub-divide upland grassland codes (102) into more precise categories and add codes for lowland rush pastures and wet heath.
  - Treat dry/wet moorland distinctions more distinctly; simplify to improve reproducibility.
  - Restrict primary boundary coding to hedge vs other, with detailed species composition captured via qualifying codes.
  - Limit mapping to the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit to improve consistency.
- Mapping of vegetation cover (at points) showed high stability for dominant species (81% for key species at a point), but much lower for co-dominants (about 34%); indicates caution when using multi-species co-dominance in analysis.

### Species group performance and land-use effect
- Group-level analyses for representative species did not show significant differences in cumulative frequency between 1990 and 1991 surveys, though individual species showed fluctuations likely due to climate and seasonal effects.
- The most robust changes were seen for a subset of common species, while others appeared to be year-specific or due to recording differences.

### Cross-time ecological gradient
- Across multiple plot types, axis shifts between 1990 and 1991 broadly aligned with earlier ECOLUC trends (1978–1988), with upland areas showing more stable gradients and lowlands showing more variation tied to agricultural changes and drought effects.

## Recommendations for Future Surveys

- Data capture and training
  - Retain and systematically study lichens as part of general surveys; include habitat information and images for familiarisation.
  - Train for bryophyte and grass identification; introduce more reference materials and habitat-specific identification aids.
  - Conduct QA as close as possible in time to the initial survey; ideally the same year or season to minimize seasonal variation.
  - Use photographs to re-establish exact plot positions; require surveyors to annotate image locations with distances and bearings when possible.
- Plot positioning and relocation
  - Annotate photographs with surrounding features; ensure documented distances and bearings are captured with sketches.
  - Use metal marker plates for X plots in enclosed land; allocate adequate manpower for relocation in unenclosed uplands.
  - Improve quadrat positioning protocols for Y plots (4 m2): orient with sides N-S (not diagonals); place at SE corner; use survey tape for precise measurement.
- Data coding and mapping
  - Expand land-use code set with clearer categories; subdivide ambiguous upland codes; add dedicated codes for lowland rush pastures and wet heath.
  - Standardize boundary coding: treat hedge presence and composition with qualifying codes; restrict to hedge for primary codes where possible.
  - Focus mapping of the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit to improve reproducibility; limit reliance on cover for all species except key indicators.
- Data quality and QA design
  - Schedule future QA to reflect actual field practice seasons; control for year-to-year climatic variation when interpreting change statistics.
  - Enhance reporting of location accuracy and data-entry errors; integrate explicit error-type classifications (mis-ID, overlooked, mis-location, seasonal effects).
  - Provide ongoing QA training and reference materials for field staff; integrate QA findings into field handbook updates.

## Implications for Data Support Practice
- Emphasizes the need for robust data quality controls across data collection, documentation, and mapping processes.
- Highlights value of including photographic evidence and standardized marker systems to enable repeatable data capture and self-serve data validation.
- Underlines importance of clear, limited, and well-documented coding schemes to ensure reproducibility and easier data integration across time and plot types.
- Suggests practical steps for building data products that enable end users to self-serve validated, high-quality vegetation and land-use data with transparent provenance.
