# Dataset Documentation

- National estimates of landscape linear feature stock for 1990 calculated using the 2007 ITE Land Classification (refer to Scott, 2007; Bunce et al, 2007). Estimates are total lengths in metres for each linear feature type per 1km square per Land Class. Note: there may be negative values in LC2007; treat these as zero.
- Key identifiers and fields:
  - FID: Feature ID (autonumber)
  - LC2007: ITE Land Class (numeric)
  - LC2007_COD: ITE Land Class (text code)
  - CSYEAR: Year of survey
  - LCAREA: Total area of relevant Land Class (00s ha)
  - LF_1 to LF_7: Length estimates per 1km square in metres for six feature types plus TOTAL
  - LFTOTAL: Total length of linear features (metres per 1km square per land class)
  - Shape_Length / Shape_Area: Geometric descriptors of the Land Class shape
- Linear feature types (with reporting interpretations):
  - _1: Hedges — managed hedgerows, may occur with other features; hedges are prioritized in reporting
  - _3: Wall — built stone/manufactured walls; may include walls with fences or banks/grass strips and/or lines of trees/shrubs
  - _4: Line of trees/shrubs/relict hedge/fence — trees/shrubs with or without hedges/fences
  - _5: Line of trees/shrubs/relict hedge — natural-line tree/shrub features; includes avenues
  - _6: Bank/grass strip — earth/stone bank or grass strip, with/without a fence
  - _7: Fence — post-and-wire/rail structures; may include grass strip, ditch, or stream
  - TOTAL: Total length of linear features
- Reporting and data relationships:
  - Reporting uses a hierarchical system of six major feature types
  - No double counting of multi-element features; hedges take precedence when co-occurring with other features
  - Hedge-containing features are reported as hedges even if adjacent to walls or fences; walls/fences are not counted where a hedge is present
- Field methodology and data quality:
  - Data collected during field surveys as a series of detailed codes; supports reporting flexibility based on code combinations
  - Negative LC2007 values arise from the statistical model; treat as zero for practical use
