# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 FIELD HANDBOOK

- The document is a Field Handbook for the Countryside Survey 1990, detailing standardized methods to collect, record, and manage land-use, vegetation, and landscape data across Britain. It builds on earlier surveys (1977/78 and 1984) and aims to monitor changes by combining ground-truth data with remote sensing, enabling consistent, comparable datasets over time.

## Purpose, scope and outputs

- Purpose
  - Standardize data collection for land use, vegetation, landscape, and change assessment.
  - Provide current, high-quality datasets for ecological evaluation and trend analysis.
  - Link bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing via the ITE Land Classification System.
- Scope
  - Large-scale field surveying across 512 sites (increased from previous surveys).
  - Two-tier data collection: mapping and field recording, plus sampling (vegetation plots and biota).
- Outputs
  - Spatially explicit data (maps, field assessment booklets) and tabular records.
  - Foundations for models of land use change and ecological patterns.

## Data collection framework and structure

- Core elements
  - Mapping: annotating 1:10,000 maps with coded features; use of alpha-numeric coding to compactly represent complex information.
  - Recording: Field Assessment Books (FABs) consolidating map annotations, ownership, physiography, vegetation, and other attributes.
  - Quadrats and sampling: vegetation plots (large 200 m2 quadrats, nested smaller plots) and various linear plots; formal sampling of freshwater biota (IFE and NELUP components).
- Codes and documentation
  - Two-code system: primary codes (essential) and secondary codes (supporting); outputs rely on consistent coding order and meaning.
  - Alphabetic codes used to compress multiple numeric codes (e.g., boundary and hedge characteristics) while preserving detail.
  - Universal codes and colour conventions provided for complex built environments (Buildings/Structures/Communications).

## Planning and logistics

- Team structure and workload
  - Six ITE Research Stations with teams (~85 squares per team); average survey time per square is planned, with flexibility for access and weather.
- Travel and scheduling
  - Emphasis on minimizing travel and avoiding overtime; travel-on-day basis, with time off in lieu if necessary.
- Permissions and access
  - Prior contact with landowners/farmers; formal permission required for full-square access; procedures for partial or no access outlined.
  - Clear escalation path if permissions are refused, including abandonment or partial resurvey with documented adjustments.

## Equipment and resources

- Provided by Merlewood (central) and local ITE Stations
  - FABs, aerial photos, 1:10,000 maps, field handouts, weatherproof clipboards, colored pens, survey poles, markers, sampling gear, measuring tape, navigation tools, ID.
- Local and surveyor-provided items
  - Additional maps, pencils, reference books, cameras, hand lenses, films, first aid, clothing, rucksacks, and personal gear.
- Documentation and identity
  - Survey teams carry ITE identity where possible; ownership and contact details recorded on FAB.

## General field survey procedure

- On-site workflow
  - Upon square arrival: perform a quick landscape scan, assess problems, seek permission for full access, plan a route that covers the entire square, and ensure full coverage and neat recording.
- Access and route planning
  - Flexible daily schedules; aim to minimize revisits; arrangements guided by station coordinators.
- Data integrity
  - After recording, review records for omissions and clarity; ensure consistency between field notes and FAB entries.

## Permissions

- Rationale for permission
  - Legal access, relationship with landowners, and access to background information (e.g., farm context) to improve data accuracy.
- Process and documentation
  - Letters issued to landowners in advance; on-site confirmations of arrangements; updated ownership records maintained.
- Handling refusals
  - If access is denied, abandon the portion or square (with replacement), or survey available sub-areas if feasible; note refusals and adjust plans accordingly.

## Data recording: filling in the FAB

- Structure of the Countryside Survey 1990 data
  - Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter detailed in Section 7).
- FAB content and usage
  - FABs consolidate map annotations, ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland water features, vegetation, and other environmental attributes.
  - Clear instructions for completing series numbers, ownership codes, and comments; emphasis on neatness and interpretability.
- Field handbook guidance
  - Standardized definitions and placeholder guidance for ambiguous cases; guidance on when to qualify or comment on choices.

## Mapping and field data capture (Section 6)

- Mapping (6.1)
  - Use enlarged 6" maps (1:10,000) with data codes; primary vs. secondary codes; linear codes linked logically to features.
  - Boundaries must be clearly marked; if a boundary no longer exists, code 999 applies; ensure minimum mapping unit and line length are recorded.
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) provides guidance for identifying features not on maps, boundaries between vegetation types, and updates to man-made features; use with ground-truthing.
- Filling in the FAB (6.1.2)
  - FABs and maps are combined into a Field Assessment Booklet; emphasis on neatness, page organization, and consistent coding across all pages.
  - Detailed instructions for ownership, land use, physiography, vegetation, and descriptive notes; specific rules for how to record presence, coverage, and qualifiers.
- Vegetation mapping and codes (6.2.2–6.2.3)
  - Vegetation recording relies on a standard set of species lists (approx. 200 common species) plus restricted combinations for difficult identifications.
  - Use 5% cover categories for each species within each mapped unit; total can exceed 100% due to layering.
  - Distinctions between cover types, species, and height classes are codified (e.g., grasses, herbs, bryophytes, and lichens); careful handling of mosaics and dominant cover.
  - For woodland and woody vegetation, linkage to woodland codes, with primary codes for canopy dominance and secondary codes for age, structure, and management.
- Boundaries and landscape features
  - Detailed boundary categorization (valls, fences, hedges, banks) with descriptive qualifiers (height, stockproof status, gaps, laying, bracken presence, etc.).
  - Rules for recording urban/rural interfaces and curtilages; specific guidance on recording features within and outside curtilages.

## Sampling design and plot types

- Quadrats
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots per square (centering on “centre of gravity” of habitat).
  - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots in natural/semi-natural land cover types.
  - Location and relocation procedures emphasize representativeness, randomization when necessary, and documentation of land-use change.
- Linear plots
  - Hedgerows, streamsides, and roadside plots each up to 10 m long; 1 m wide plots, placed adjacent to dominant vertical feature.
  - Boundary plots located at land-use interfaces; careful rules to avoid overlap and ensure sampling of diverse habitat types within a square.
  - Additional verge and road-verge plots to ensure coverage across road types and verge categories.
- 1978 rules and relocation
  - Historical positioning from 1978 is used as a baseline; where features no longer exist, relocation or redefinition is performed with explicit mapping notes.
- Plot marking and relocation
  - Permanent metal plates or boundary-based markers used to relocate plots; sketches and distances recorded for reproducibility; plots must be relocated within defined tolerances to maintain comparability across surveys.

## Vegetation and species identification guidelines

- Species data
  - Emphasis on species-level recording where possible; a curated list of common species is used; certain difficult identifications allowed as approved species combinations.
  - Bryophytes and lichens are recorded with a restricted list; some species may be grouped into combinations for consistency.
- Covers and mosaics
  - Use of up to three cover codes for mosaics; 5% cover increments; >5% cover included; 5% category discretization required.
- Special notes
  - Distinct rules for arable crops, grassland classifications, and management types (Ley, Unmanaged grass, Burnt, etc.).
  - Age and diameter information for woodland canopy; codes account for age classes, canopy density, and age-related management actions.

## Freshwater biota and photography (sections 7–8)

- Freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP)
  - Two per square: flowing waters (IFE) and standing water (NELUP).
  - Standing-water sites include lakes, ponds, ditches, flushes, bogs, and seasonal features; collection uses standardized sieving and formalin-preserved samples with labeling.
- Photography
  - Print films used to photograph every vegetation plot; plot numbers clearly displayed on a board at plot edge for landmarking and later reference.

## Procedures after fieldwork

- End-of-day reconciliation
  - Read through FABs to ensure no feature is omitted; avoid post-hoc transcriptions unless maps are damaged.
- Sample and data transfer
  - Transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly; ensure proper labeling and containment of collected materials.

## Data quality, standardization, and reproducibility

- Standardization emphasis
  - Consistent field methods, coding schemes, and documentation to enable reliable comparisons across years and squares.
- Quality control
  - Standardized field handbook and field definitions; field observers expected to qualify ambiguous cases and note uncertainties.
- Documentation and transparency
  - Comprehensive notes on permissions, plot relocations, and changes in land use to maintain methodological integrity and traceability.

## Endnotes and contacts

- Background and further information available through ITE and Merlewood Research Station; the handbook includes guidance on contacting program coordinators and using the published definitions and code lists.
