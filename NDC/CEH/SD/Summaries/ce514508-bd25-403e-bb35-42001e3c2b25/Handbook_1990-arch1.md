# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Introduction
- Land use studies are categorized into data collection/monitoring, land management interactions, land optimisation, and prediction.
- ITE conducted two major GB surveys (1977/8 and 1984) using the ITE Land Classification System; these informed ecological understanding and served as stratification for sampling.
- A 1988 subsample and 1990 resurvey aim to update datasets, link top-down remote sensing with ground data, and monitor ongoing countryside changes.
- The 1990 programme expands sampling to 512 sites with enhanced detail, greater collaboration, and satellite imagery integration to produce a Britain-wide land cover map.
- A key lesson is the need to standardise field recording to improve statistical accuracy; quality control and a Field Handbook support consistency.
- The handbook defines guidelines for survey conduct, though field staff may encounter situations not fully covered by the document.

## Aims and Scope
- Provide current, high-quality datasets for assessing ecological systems and changes in land use, enabling scientific evaluation and trend detection.
- Link ground-truth field survey results with satellite-derived land cover data via a two-tier approach.
- Maintain data provenance and create discoverable datasets with metadata.

## Survey Design and Planning
- The sample comprises 512 sites, grouped into six teams from six ITE Research Stations; each group covers about 85 squares.
- Each square normally requires about three survey days; planning emphasizes efficiency (e.g., minimizing unnecessary site revisits) and flexible working arrangements.
- Travel time costs are considered; no overtime pay initially, with time off in lieu for large overtime accruals.
- Survey logistics support multiple planning options (local daily travel, short away placements, or longer away periods with weekend work).

## Equipment and Practicalities
- Equipment provided by Merlewood (FABs, aerial photographs, maps, weatherproof clipboards, etc.) and by local ITE stations (maps, pencils, cameras, field tools).
- Surveyors may also provide personal gear (clothing, rucksacks); some items may be loaned or loaned per site needs.

## Permissions and Access
- Permissions are essential to access all parts of a square and to maintain good relations with landowners/farmers.
- Prior letters and direct contact are used to establish arrangements; in some cases, prior contact can slow progress.
- If permission is refused for part or all of a square, predefined contingency procedures apply (e.g., abandoning the square, or surveying accessible parts, or replacement squares).
- Surveyors should engage with landowners rather than staff and carry ITE identification.

## Data Recording (FAB: Field Assessment Booklet)
- The Countryside Survey 1990 comprises mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; sampling is covered in Section 7.
- FABs compile square-specific data, maps, and associated photographs; the booklet format integrates multiple sections and data types.
- Key recording practices include neat completion, consistent square numbering, and field-time notes to ensure interpretable data for analysis.
- Ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland/water/coastal features, land use, vegetation/ground cover, boundaries, buildings/structures/communications, and universal X codes are captured on FAB pages.
- Ownership and contact details are recorded to aid permissions and potential follow-ups.

## Mapping, API, and FAB Completion
- Mapping (6.1) involves annotating enlarged 1:10,000 maps with data codes; primary codes are essential, and multiple primary codes should be avoided unless necessary.
- API (Aerial Photograph Interpretation) assists feature identification not on OS maps (isolated trees, boundaries, etc.) and is used cautiously if ground evidence conflicts.
- FAB completion guidelines (6.1.2) emphasize neatness, consistent series numbers, and careful code application; designers emphasize that field decisions should be grounded in on-site observation.

## Vegetation Recording and Plot Types (6.2)
- The survey uses permanent plots and standardized vegetation recording sheets; plots include large quadrats (200 m2) and smaller plots (2 m x 2 m).
- Large quadrats are nested: inner 4 m2 quadrats feed into the larger 200 m2 plot, with cover estimated in 5% bands.
- Permanent markers (metal plates) and field sketches support relocation and future surveys.
- Five small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) are placed in different semi-natural/natural land cover types per square to capture habitat diversity.
- Location/relocation rules direct relocation when land use changes; if a plot cannot be relocated, documentation and alternatives are recorded.
- Plots are placed to best represent habitat “center of gravity,” with randomisation used to avoid bias when needed.
- If plots fall in a cropped field, the plot is placed at the field edge with sampling extended into the crop edge as necessary.

## General Rules for Linear Plots (6.2.3)
- Linear plots include boundary plots (hedgerows), hedgerow plots, streamside plots, and roadside plots.
- Locations are defined relative to dominant vertical features; plots are oriented with a 1 m width and positional rules ensure plots do not overlap or cluster inappropriately.
- Additional “extra” plots exist to cover diverse ditch/stream types and verges, with careful placement to reflect the landscape's variability.

## 1978 Rules and Species Identification (6.2.4 & 6.2.5)
- 1978 rules for locating linear plots guide placement near quadrats; where nearest features are unsuitable, plots are relocated following defined procedures.
- Species identification guidelines emphasize species-level recording where possible, with accepted combinations where precise identification is not feasible.
- The survey uses a standard list of 200 common species (plants, grasses, bryophytes) and restricted lists for bryophytes/lichens, with a provision for unlisted species.

## Sampling (Section 7)
- Two types of freshwater biota samples per square: freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE) and standing water biota (NELUP; water beetles focus).
- From each square, two standing-water samples are collected, reflecting two characteristic water habitats (lakes/lochs, ponds, dried pools, calcareous/acidi flushes, Sphagnum bogs, etc.).
- Field samples include documented metadata (square number, date, collector) and are preserved for transport to Merlewood.

## Photography (Section 8)
- Print films photograph every vegetation plot to capture general appearance and landmark context.
- Plot numbers are displayed on a visible board at the edge of each plot for reference.

## Procedures Subsequent to Survey (Section 9)
- End-of-day data checks to ensure completeness; if data must be transcribed due to damage, transcription should be minimized and documented.
- FABs and samples are transported to ITE Stations promptly.

## Data Management and Deliverables
- The programme emphasises metadata, standardised coding, and robust documentation to enable data reuse and future monitoring.
- Permanent markers, detailed mapping, and linked FAB pages support repeatability and traceability across surveys.
- The overall aim is to produce a coherent, updatable database of land cover, land use, and vegetation change for scientific evaluation and policy-relevant insights.
