# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

- Purpose and scope
  - Establish a systematic, high-quality data framework to monitor changes in land cover, vegetation, and landscape across Britain.
  - Build on earlier ITE surveys (1977/78 and 1984) using the ITE Land Classification System; integrate ground-truth data with satellite imagery for a two-tier approach linking top-down and bottom-up data.
  - Plan to resurvey in 1990 with enhanced data capture, greater collaboration, and improved data detail; aim for current, scientifically evaluable datasets and trend detection.

- Data management and governance
  - Large, coordinated field program: 512 squares divided into six groups, surveyed by teams from six ITE Research Stations; each team oversees about 85 squares.
  - Emphasis on data standardization, quality control, and consistency across observers and years; thorough Field Handbook and accompanying definitions to ensure reproducibility.
  - Data assets include Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), 1:10,000 aerial imagery, maps, and standardized coding schemes to ensure uniform data capture, annotation, and metadata.
  - Permanent plot markers and relocation protocols to enable precise future resurvey and long-term data continuity.
  - Clear ownership and permissions framework to access land, engage farmers/landowners, and manage refusals with predefined contingency steps.

- Data collection methods and structure
  - Three core FAB elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; sampling adds a vegetation and landscape data dimension.
  - Mapping and data coding
    - Enforced use of structured data codes (primary and secondary) and alpha codes to compress complex information while preserving detail.
    - Comprehensive handling of boundaries, land-use types, and landscape features; API (aerial photo interpretation) used as guidance but ground-truthing remains authoritative.
  - Vegetation recording and quadrats
    - Large quadrats: 200 m2 (to capture broad habitat context); nested 4 m2 quadrats; five 2 m x 2 m small quadrats placed in selected land cover types.
    - Permanent marking of quadrats with metal plates for reliable relocation; detailed placement procedures for field practicality (edge cases in crops, moorland, woodland, etc.).
    - Five small quadrats per square placed in diverse, representative land-cover types; locations determined after mapping of land cover.
    - Location/relocation rules emphasize consistency with prior years; if land use changes, relocations follow predefined guidelines to preserve comparability.
  - Linear plots
    - Up to 5 linear plots per square across hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides, and boundary plots; standardized 1 m width from dominant features; each plot permanently marked.
    - Special rules for hedgerows, streams, and roadside verges, including additional plots to capture edge and corridor biodiversity.
  - Species identification and data quality
    - Standardized approach to species-level recording where possible; predefined acceptable species combinations for difficult identifications; inclusion of bryophytes and lichens with a restricted list.
    - Vegetation data supported by a print-out of 200 common species with a nested plot structure to capture mosaic vegetation.
  - Data capture workflow
    - FABs completed neatly; square series numbers and ownership details consistently recorded; ownership and farmer interviews documented for background context.
    - Photographs taken for each vegetation plot; all data eventually transcribed and added to centralized datasets at ITE stations (Merlewood).

- Permissions and stakeholder engagement
  - Permissions sought to ensure legal access and maintain good relations with landowners; letters issued in advance and direct site visits arranged to confirm arrangements.
  - Clear procedures if permission is refused (replacement square, or partial survey with notes); emphasize engaging the primary landowner rather than staff.
  - Documentation of landowner information and ownership across squares to facilitate future surveys and stakeholder relations.

- Outputs, integration, and future work
  - Data designed to be compatible with satellite-derived land cover data; aims to connect ground-truth data with remote sensing for robust up-to-date Britain-wide land-use mapping.
  - The 1990 resurvey expands data depth, including more detailed ground-truthing, additional research activities, and increased collaboration.
  - Permanent markers and standardized plotting enable precise longitudinal analyses of habitat change, including changes in vegetation types, boundaries, and land management practices.

- Logistics and procedures
  - Team logistics and travel arrangements optimized to minimize time and costs; flexible scheduling; no overtime pay, with compensatory time off for large overtime accumulations.
  - End-of-day data verification and safe transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations; procedures for damaged or spoilt data solely to be used when necessary.
  - Photography and documentation integrated into the data workflow to support interpretation and future analyses.

- Contact and background
  - Background on the Countryside Survey program, its history, and the ITE’s commitment to monitoring changes in the rural environment; contact points and publication references provided for further information.
