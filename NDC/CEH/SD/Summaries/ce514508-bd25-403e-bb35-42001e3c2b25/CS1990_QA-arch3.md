# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Aim
- Outline the scope of quality assurance for the 1990 Countryside Survey.
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording and change statistics.
- Explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, data type, and regional factors.
- Relate findings to previous comparative work and recommend methodological modifications for future surveys to improve accuracy and confidence in statistics.

## Background
- Field surveys involve many recorders, creating inherent variation despite training and supervision.
- QA exercises (1989–1991) were conducted to assess consistency and reliability of major field components.
- Previous work highlighted issues with plot relocation, species recognition, and data transformation; the QA aimed to address these gaps and improve data quality and comparability.

## Methods
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares assessed using sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors; focus on relocation accuracy.
  - 1991: Expanded to include photographs of plots; 1 km squares from each of 32 terrain classes; each square visited within 14 days of original survey date; included self-assessment of some squares.
- Plot types and sampling:
  - Six plot types: 200 m2 X-plots, 4 m2 Y-plots, and linear plots along road verges, hedges, streamsides, and boundaries.
  - In each square, a quarter was resurveyed to include the representation of plot types; nine predetermined points per quarter for landcover and boundaries.
- Relocation and data capture:
  - Attempted relocation of buried metal plates marking quadrats, using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors.
  - In 1991, photographs supplemented relocation to test improvements.
- Data quality measures:
  - Species concordance (four indices: simple percentage agreement, agreement excluding potential T1 errors, agreement assuming T1 as correct, and percentage accuracy removing T2 errors).
  - Initial efficiency of recording (based on 1990 data).
  - Analyses stratified by plot type and landclass aggregates (LC: lowland arable, LG: lowland grassland, MA: marginal land, UP: upland).
- Additional analyses:
  - Cover estimates for species present in both surveys (Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests).
  - DECORANA ordination to examine ecological gradient shifts between survey years.
  - Mapping codes and land-use classifications to assess coding reliability and boundary delineation.

## Key Findings
- Overall accuracy and concordance:
 - 1990 autumn QA: ~45% initial species agreement.
  - 1991 QA: overall percentage agreement rose to 60.9%, with an overall estimated initial recording efficiency around 74% (max ~79% possible under ideal conditions).
  - When seasonal/annual differences (drought in 1990) are accounted for, increases in species per plot in 1991 suggest real ecological changes rather than solely improved recording.
- Species counts and changes:
  - Across plots, the 1991 reassessment showed a significant increase in mean species per plot, driven largely by real ecological differences between a drought year (1990) and a normal growing year (1991), though some improvements were attributed to assessors’ recording efficiency.
  - Annual climatic variation and management changes contributed to observed differences; under-recording in 1990 also played a role.
  - Some species showed genuine frequency changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Alliaria petiolata, Lapsana communis), while others (Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis) reflected under-recording in 1990.
- Plot relocation and plate-based procedures:
  - Plate relocation success (and thus plot relocation) varied by plot type:
    - Autumn 1990: ~71% plate/plot relocation with 5-minute searches.
    - 1991: ~65% plate success; ~87% plots relocated.
  - X-plots relocated more reliably than Y-plots; Y-plots were notably difficult; plate-based relocation was effective but time-consuming in unenclosed upland areas.
  - Recommendations emphasize using metal plates where feasible to improve relocation, with additional man-hours allocated for upland areas.
- Species recording and cover estimates:
  - Cover estimates showed few significant differences across years for many species; some notable exceptions existed, notably for a number of common grasses and bryophytes.
  - Seasonal and management changes contributed to many differences; emphasis recommended on focusing on the most prevalent species and improving training in grasses and bryophyte identification.
  - Tree and shrub cover recording required clearer guidelines in handbooks and training; consistent application of cover rules is essential for downstream analyses.
- Land-use mapping and coding:
  - High concordance for primary land-use codes (approximately 88%) and boundary codes (roughly 80–83%), though boundary coding was more variable when assessed by different pairs of assessors or in different occasions.
  - Some codes caused misclassifications (e.g., marsh, upland grassland, moorland vs blanket) due to handbook ambiguities.
  - Recommendations include subdividing certain upland grassland codes, adding codes for lowland rush pasture, recognizing wet heath as a distinct vegetation type, and restricting primary boundary codes to hedge content with associated qualifying codes for composition.
- Mapping of species and vegetation cover:
  - Point-based mapping showed high concordance for dominant species at a single point, but concordance dropped for co-dominants (81% for a single dominant presence, 34% for two co-dominants).
  - Overall, even unenclosed upland areas were mapped with careful attention, but robust reproducibility is best achieved when comparisons focus on the most apparent species at a given point.
- Multiyear/ecological gradient assessment:
  - DECORANA axis analysis indicated shifts in ecological gradients consistent with land-use and climate changes over time, with upland vs lowland differences and evidence of year-to-year perturbations in marginal areas due to climate.
- Recommendations arising from findings (grouped conceptually):
  - Field recording and training:
    - Train on bryophyte and grass identification; differentiate similar taxa; emphasize vegetative characteristics.
    - Use lichens as part of general surveys; include habitat information in training.
    - Enhance guidance on tree/shrub cover recording and use of parentheses for cover values.
  - Data collection and relocation:
    - Employ photographic references for plot relocation; ensure photographs include distances and identifiable nearby features.
    - Annotate photographs with plot-distance information; use metal plates to mark plots where possible; plan for extra manpower in upland relocation.
    - For Y-plots, adopt a tape-based, NS-oriented layout with SE corner placement to improve positioning accuracy.
  - Timing and seasonality:
    - Conduct QA in the same season and year as the original survey to minimize seasonal confounding.
    - If not possible, plan QA to minimize year-to-year climatic effects impacting species presence.
  - Land-use coding and mapping:
    - Expand and clarify land-use code set; make primary codes more split and dichotomous to reduce ambiguity.
    - Record only the two most prevalent species for land-use parcels to improve mapping reproducibility.
    - Standardize boundary codings and qualifying codes; restrict primary boundary codes to hedge and document composition separately.
  - Data handling and reporting:
    - Ensure metadata and data sharing standards are established from the outset to facilitate verification and governance.
    - Maintain clear documentation of observed changes vs. recording changes to support robust interpretation of change statistics.
  - Specific code recommendations:
    - Subdivide upland grassland (102) into “upland improved meadow/pasture” and “upland grassland.”
    - Add distinct codes for lowland rush pasture and wet heath as a primary vegetation type.
    - Create a dedicated boundary code schema that distinguishes hedge presence and species composition via qualifying codes.

## Conclusions for future surveys
- Photographs and sketches are crucial aids for plot relocation, especially in unenclosed land; time and landowner access remain practical constraints.
- Distances and compass bearings should accompany sketches to improve relocation accuracy; encourage annotating photos with location context.
- Metal plates for plot marking were effective; however, relocation in upland areas is time-intensive and may require additional staffing.
- Y-plots pose particular relocation challenges; improved quadrat positioning techniques and clearer documentation on plot location are recommended.
- Species identification is generally robust but grasses and bryophytes require targeted training; seasonal and annual changes can substantially affect recorded species lists.
- Seasonality should be controlled in QA design; ideally QA should occur in the same year as the original survey to avoid climate-driven discrepancies.
- Land-use mapping should balance code richness with reproducibility; reduce emphasis on fine-grain species cover in mapping and focus on dominant components of land-use units.

## Annex and supplementary outcomes (brief)
- Mapping and land-use code concordance summarized across multiple squares, with high overall agreement but notable variability in upland areas and certain boundary and habitat codes.
- The QA process provided actionable, granular recommendations across plotting, tagging, coding, and training to enhance the reliability of future environmental monitoring surveys.
