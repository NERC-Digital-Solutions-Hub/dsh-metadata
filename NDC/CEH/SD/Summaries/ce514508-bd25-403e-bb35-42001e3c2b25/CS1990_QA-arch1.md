Countryside Survey 1990 Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview and aims
- Evaluate the quality assurance conducted for the 1990 Countryside Survey.
- Quantify accuracy of field recording, explain observer/temporal differences, and relate findings to previous work.
- Recommend methodological improvements for future surveys to improve accuracy and confidence in statistics.

## Methods
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: limited to 21 of the original survey squares; used original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: full QA with addition of photographs of individual plots; same assessors revisited 1 km squares across 32 terrain classes; included self-assessment in some squares.
- Plot types assessed (six types in the 1990 survey): X plots (200 m2), Y plots (4 m2), road verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries.
- Plate relocation: attempted relocation of buried corner plates using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors; capture rates and time measurements.
- Data comparisons: multiple concordance indices for species lists (percent agreement, “agreement,” “% accuracy,” etc.); analysis of changes in species numbers per plot; DECORANA ordination to relate axis shifts to management/land-use changes; analysis of land-use and mapping codes; cover estimates comparisons.
- Sub-analyses: breakdown by land-class aggregates (LC, LG, MA, UP) and plot types; evaluation of mapping codes and cover estimates; assessment of the influence of season, drought, and relocation accuracy.

## Key findings

- Overall recording accuracy and concordance
  - Initial assessment (1990 QA) showed modest agreement in species lists between time 1 (T1) and time 2 (T2): mean concordance around 47% for some measures, with broader estimates up to around 60%.
  - Full 1991 QA yielded higher concordance: overall percentage agreement 60.9% when considering variation sources; when removing T2 variations, initial efficiency of recording averaged about 74% (approaching 79% in some idealized conditions).
  - After accounting for seasonal/annual changes and relocation issues, a substantial portion of mismatches reflected real ecological variation (e.g., drought year 1990 vs wetter 1991) rather than mere recorder error.
  - Frequency analyses across common species indicated that some apparent changes were genuine population changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana communis) while others were likely under-recording or seasonal effects (e.g., Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis).

- Plot relocation and plate relocation
  - Plate relocation success varied by plot type; early autumn results showed 71% recovery rate with five-minute searches.
  - 1991 exercise reported patchy but substantial relocation success across plot types, with “plates found” and “plots found” metrics indicating better relocation when photographs or plates were used, but more difficulty in Y plots (small quadrats) and unenclosed uplands.
  - Recommendations emphasized using metal plates where possible to improve relocation, and using photographs to re-establish position.

- Species data quality and changes
  - Species concordance across plots showed substantial but not complete stability; variability was driven by crop changes, relocation errors, and seasonal effects.
  - DECORANA analyses indicated shifts along the first axis consistent with land-use change and geographic gradients; upland plots often clustered differently due to distinct vegetation.
  - Across many plot types, most of the observed axis shifts were attributed to a combination of crop changes, relocation issues, and differences in cover assignment; recording of tree and shrub cover was highlighted as an area needing clearer guidelines.

- Land-use mapping and boundary coding
  - Mapping of primary land-use codes was generally reliable; concordance for primary land-use codes around 88–89% overall, with boundary primary codes around 80–83%.
  - Qualifying codes (e.g., for hedges, boundaries) showed greater variation, partly due to interpretive differences between assessors and the same square being re-surveyed by different assessor teams.
  - The mapping exercise revealed two key factors: interpretation of codes and the complexity of the coding system; boundary and hedge-related codes were more error-prone than core land-use categories.

- Cover estimates and vegetation mapping
  - Comparisons of cover estimates at nine fixed points showed limited but notable differences; two species (Holcus lanatus and Poa trivialis) showed significant differences in cover between 1990 and 1991, while many other species did not.
  - Overall, cover data were less stable than presence/absence data; concordance for dominant species at points was around 81% for some major species, but co-dominant scenarios dropped considerably.
  - There was a strong recommendation to simplify cover coding to focus on the most prevalent species to improve reproducibility.

- Plot-level ecological gradients and species groups
  - Axis shifts in DECORANA can be linked to management or climate differences; results showed consistent directional changes for several plot types, with upland aggregates (UP) showing distinct patterns.
  - Analyses of species groups did not show significant cumulative changes between 1990 and 1991, suggesting that observed fluctuations were driven by a mix of climate and local management rather than wholesale changes in assemblages.

- Mapping accuracy and boundary/land-use codes
  - Primary land-use code agreement was high (approximately 88–89% overall); boundary primary codes were a bit lower (around 80–83%), reflecting interpretive challenges.
  - There was strong evidence that surveyors consistently used the codes, with little evidence of random guessing; however, interpretation of certain qualifiers and the large suite of codes led to some systematic mismatches.
  - A comprehensive annex (Tables 13–16) detailed concordance by land-use codes, boundary codes, and species mapping; it highlighted substantial reliability for major categories but more variability for minor or ambiguous categories.

## Recommendations (selected highlights)

- Recommendation 1: Retain lichens in general surveys; provide training with species samples and habitat information.
- Recommendation 2: Conduct QA exercises as close as practical to the initial survey time to isolate genuine observer effects from seasonal/annual ecological changes.
- Recommendation 3: Surveyors should annotate photographs and relate them to the corresponding plot features, including distances to nearby features.
- Recommendation 4: Use metal marker plates to mark X plots in enclosed land where possible to facilitate relocation.
- Recommendation 5: Define 4 m2 (Y plots) with a survey tape; orient the plot such that the side (not the diagonal) faces north-south; position at the southeast corner.
- Recommendation 6–7: (Not explicitly itemized in the provided text; overall QA guidance implies refining procedures.)
- Recommendation 8: Sub-divide upland grassland code 102 into more specific categories (e.g., upland improved meadow/pasture vs. upland grassland) to reflect major habitat differences.
- Recommendation 9: Create a distinct code for lowland rush pasture to avoid conflating similar-looking habitats.
- Recommendation 10: Recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type and assign a primary code accordingly.
- Recommendation 11: Limit primary boundary codes to hedge presence; use qualifying codes to describe hedge species composition.
- Recommendation 12: Simplify mapping by focusing on the two most prevalent species within a vegetation unit; reduce emphasis on recording detailed cover for many species to improve reproducibility.

- Additional methodological guidance
  - Increase the number of primary land-use codes and provide dichotomous keys to reduce ambiguity.
  - Place greater emphasis on map-based recording of land-use parcels rather than exhaustive species-by-species cover, particularly for large-scale surveys.
  - Target bryophyte and key grass species more explicitly in training and QA exercises due to identification challenges and ecological importance in certain habitats.
  - Ensure QA occurs in the same year as the survey to minimize year-to-year climatic effects on species appearance and detectability.
  - Improve relocation strategies in unenclosed areas, with clearer guidelines for using photographs, sketches, distances, and bearings.

## Conclusions for future surveys
- Photographs are crucial for accurate plot relocation, especially in unenclosed areas; sketches and photographs were largely adequate but could benefit from additional locational details (distances, compass bearings).
- Platemark relocation proved effective and should be retained, with additional staffing for challenging upland/enclosed areas to maintain efficiency.
- Y plots proved particularly challenging; enhanced ground-positioning methods and clearer photographic documentation are recommended.
- Species identification was generally robust, but grasses and bryophytes require targeted training and possibly expanded species lists in certain habitats.
- Seasonal and annual changes can produce substantial differences in species lists; QA should be timed to minimize such differences or explicitly account for them in analyses.
- Land-use mapping codes are largely reliable for major categories but require refinement for minor categories; increasing primary codes and simplifying cover requirements will improve consistency and reproducibility.
- Overall, the Countryside Survey QA exercises demonstrate meaningful real differences between years and highlight practical, actionable improvements for future surveys to increase data reliability and interpretability.
