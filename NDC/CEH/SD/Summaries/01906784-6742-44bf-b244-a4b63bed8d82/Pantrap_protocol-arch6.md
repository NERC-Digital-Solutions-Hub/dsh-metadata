# Pollinator data from pan traps located in habitats comprising different floral cover in Buckinghamshire, UK

## Overview
- Datasets describe pollinator species caught in pan traps across habitats with varying floral cover.
- Collected in June 2015 at the Hillesden estate, Buckinghamshire, UK.
- Part of a larger experiment examining how floral resources affect pollination services to isolated plants.

## Experimental design
- Four 100-hectare blocks, each separated by more than 500 meters.
- At the center of each block, four experimental arrays placed along a 150 m transect, with two arrays in florally rich habitat and two in florally poor habitat.
- Each array contained three Eschscholzia californica plants in a triangular arrangement.
- Pan traps positioned at the center of each array to assess pollinator activity relative to floral resources.

## Collection methods
- Pan traps: three circular bowls (80 x 200 mm) with non-toxic fluorescent paint (yellow, blue, white); filled with water and a drop of dishwashing liquid.
- Traps deployed for 24 hours at each of 16 arrays on the same day; surveys conducted twice weekly over a 16-day period (totaling four surveys).
- Surveys conducted in randomised order between 09:30 and 17:00.
- After collection, insects from main pollinator groups were counted, then identified to species level under a dissecting microscope.
- Intertegular span of each insect measured with digital calipers.

## Quality control
- Field collection and identifications conducted by Evans, T.M., trained in pollinator identification and field ecology.
- Identifications checked by a recognised expert in bee identification.

## Data structure and units
- Data stored in a single CSV file: Pantrap_catches_from_Buckinghamshire_UK.csv.
- Grid references recorded for each experimental array.
- Intertegular span recorded in millimetres.
- If no pollinators were recorded on a survey date: Pollinator species column contains 'None' and Intertegular span column contains 'NA'.
- Columns include: Block (identification number for the four replicate blocks), Experimental array (identification within each block), Habitat, Treatment, Survey date.
- Taxonomic groups covered: Hymenoptera (Apoidea), Diptera (Syrphidae), and Lepidoptera.

## Context and usage notes
- Data are complete and were collected and interpreted by Evans, T.M.
- The dataset supports analysis of how floral resources influence pollinator presence and body size (Intertegular span) across habitat types.
- Suitable for self-contained data exploration, cross-site comparisons, and informing pollination service studies within similar ecological setups.
