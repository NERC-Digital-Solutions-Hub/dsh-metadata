# Pollinator data from pan traps located in habitats comprising different floral cover in Buckinghamshire, UK

## Scope and purpose
- Dataset of pollinator species caught in pan traps across habitats with varying floral cover.
- Part of a larger experiment assessing how floral resources influence pollination services to isolated plants.
- Data collected to support ecological monitoring and analysis of pollinator activity in relation to habitat quality.

## Study site and experimental design
- Location: Hillesden estate, Buckinghamshire, UK.
- Timeframe: June 2015.
- Experimental layout: four 100ha blocks, each separated by more than 500 m.
- Within each block: four experimental arrays placed at 50 m intervals along a 150 m transect across the boundary between florally rich wildflower patches and florally poor bare fallow ground (two arrays in each habitat type per block).
- Arrays: each comprised of three Eschscholzia californica plants arranged in a triangle; pan traps placed at the center of each array to measure pollinator activity relative to floral resources.

## Pan trap deployment and collection
- Pan traps: three circular plastic bowls (80 x 200 mm) painted yellow, blue, and white with non-toxic fluorescent paint; filled with water and a drop of fragrance-free washing liquid.
- Deployment: 24 hours per survey at each of 16 arrays; four surveys conducted over a 16-day period; surveys twice weekly.
- Timing: each survey conducted in randomised order between 0930 and 1700.
- Processing: after 24 hours, traps strained through fine muslin, insects sorted by taxonomic group, identified to species level (main groups: Hymenoptera Apoidea, Diptera Syrphidae, Lepidoptera), and intertegular span measured with digital calipers.

## Taxonomic identification and quality control
- Field identifications performed by Evans, T.M., trained in pollinator identification and field ecology.
- Final identifications checked by a recognised bee taxonomic expert.

## Data structure and units
- Primary data file: Pantrap_catches_from_Buckinghamshire_UK.csv.
- Recorded fields: grid references for each array; intertegular span in millimetres; Block (1–4), Experimental array (1–4 within each block); Habitat ( florally rich vs florally poor); Treatment; Survey date.
- Data conventions: if no pollinators detected on a survey date, Pollinator species = "None" and Intertegular span = "NA".

## Key dataset characteristics
- Taxa focus: pollinators from main groups (Apoidea, Syrphidae, Lepidoptera).
- Sample intensity: 16 arrays per survey day across four blocks, with repeated surveys over a 16-day period.
- Completeness: dataset described as complete and collected/interpreted by Evans, T.M.; supported by documentation titled Pollinator data from pan traps located in habitats comprising different floral cover in Buckinghamshire, UK.

## Context and accessibility
- Part of a broader experiment investigating how floral resource availability affects pollination services to isolated plants.
- Supporting documentation available for reference and methodological details.
- Data format (CSV) facilitates integration with other environmental monitoring datasets and potential data sharing.
