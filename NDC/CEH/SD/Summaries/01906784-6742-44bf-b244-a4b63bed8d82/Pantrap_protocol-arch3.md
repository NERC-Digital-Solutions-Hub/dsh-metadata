Pollinator data from pan traps located in habitats comprising different floral cover in Buckinghamshire, UK

## Overview
- A dataset of pollinator species caught in pan traps across habitats with different floral cover.
- Collected June 2015 at the Hillesden estate, Buckinghamshire, UK.
- Part of a larger experiment examining how floral resources influence pollination services to isolated plants.

## Experimental Design
- Four 100 ha blocks, each >500 m apart.
- Within each block, four experimental arrays centered along a 150 m transect (two arrays in florally rich habitat, two in florally poor habitat).
- Each array contains three Eschscholzia californica plants arranged in a triangle.
- Pan traps placed at the center of each array to assess pollinator activity relative to floral resources.

## Collection Methods
- Pan traps: three bowls (yellow, blue, white) filled with water and a drop of non-fragranced detergent.
- Deployment: 24 hours per survey, across 16 arrays, with four surveys in total; surveys conducted in randomized order between 09:30 and 17:00.
- Processing: after 24 hours, traps strained and sorted; pollinators from main groups (Hymenoptera Apoidea, Diptera Syrphidae, Lepidoptera) counted and identified to species; intertegular span measured with digital calipers.

## Taxonomic Identification and Measurements
- Insect groups identified to species level; intertegular span (mm) recorded for main pollinator groups.
- Identifications performed by Evans, T.M and checked by a recognised expert in bee identification.

## Data Structure and Accessibility
- Data stored in a single CSV file: Pantrap_catches_from_Buckinghamshire_UK.csv.
- Key fields include: Block, Experimental array, Habitat, Treatment, Survey date, Pollinator species, Intertegular span, and grid references.
- Handling of missing data: if no pollinators were recorded, Pollinator species = None and Intertegular span = NA.

## Quality Assurance
- Field collections and identifications conducted by a trained researcher; subsequent verification by an expert ensures reliability.
- Complete dataset described and documented within the supporting materials.

## Supporting Documentation and Context
- The dataset is accompanied by documentation and forms part of a broader study on how floral resources affect pollination services to isolated plants.

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates a structured approach to measuring pollinator activity in relation to habitat resources, suitable for informing policy decisions on habitat management and pollinator conservation.
- Emphasizes the importance of metadata, data provenance, and transparent data sharing (e.g., public availability of underlying data and clear data fields).
- Highlights governance considerations relevant to monitoring frameworks: data quality, standardization, timely access, and explicit documentation of methods and units.

## Limitations and Considerations for Policy use
- Single study site and timeframe (Hillesden estate, June 2015) may limit generalizability.
- Specific experimental setup (pan traps with E. californica arrays) may affect extrapolation to broader pollinator monitoring programs.
- Metadata completeness and interoperability with other datasets are critical to maximize usefulness in monitoring dashboards and cross-project analyses.
