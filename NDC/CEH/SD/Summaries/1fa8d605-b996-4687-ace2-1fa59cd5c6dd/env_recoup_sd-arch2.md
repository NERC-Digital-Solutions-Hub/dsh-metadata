# RECOUP-Moor Environmental data: Methodology

- Field Site
  - Stalybridge estate (Saddleworth Moor), a blanket bog near Manchester, UK.
  - Vegetation: Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum.
  - 2018 wildfire on Saddleworth Moor burned 18 km2, removing surface vegetation.

- Methods
  - Plot design: 10 plots established Oct 2018 at the post-fire site, each 10 m x 10 m.
  - Burn characterization: 5 plots with shallow burn (S1-5) and 5 with deep burn (D1-5); all plots exposed bare peat.
  - Field measurements: geographic location, elevation, slope; soil temperature recorded at multiple time points over 24 months.
  - Soil sampling: July 23 2019, peat samples (5 cm x 5 cm x 2 cm) collected from each plot, homogenized, and stored at ~5°C.
  - Sample preparation: dried at 70°C for 72 hours, crushed to a fine powder.
  - Carbon and nitrogen analysis: three subsamples per plot combusted at 1800°C; CN_ratio, C_cont, and N_cont derived from triplicate subsamples (averaged per plot).
  - Elemental analysis: two subsamples per plot analyzed by ICP-MS for 22 elements; results averaged per plot.

- Variable Key
  - Plot identifiers and location: Plot_number, Plot_ID; N_Coor (latitude), W_Coor (longitude); Elevation; Slope.
  - Temporal/physical measurements: Temp_Oct18 (soil temp 22/10/18), Temp_May19 (14/05/19), Temp_Jul19 (23/07/19); CN_ratio; C_cont; N_cont.
  - Elemental composition (mg/g): Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg (noted as Silver content), K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, S, Si, Sr, Zn.

- Data handling and outputs
  - Data collected to quantify post-fire soil chemistry and elemental composition across burn severities.
  - Standardized sampling and analysis methods to enable comparison across plots and time.

- Relevance for environment monitoring (Analysts perspective)
  - Uses established sources and standardized QA/QC in sampling, preparation, and analysis.
  - Produces clear, comparable outputs (temperature series, CN data, and multi-element profiles) suitable for environmental health assessment and policy monitoring over time.
  - Datasets are stored in a structured format and prepared for upload to appropriate data portals, facilitating broad accessibility.

- Data value and accessibility considerations (as per archetype challenges)
  - The methodology supports integrating these plot-level data with other environmental datasets to enhance value beyond single-use analyses.
  - Emphasizes availability of underlying data (coordinates, temperatures, chemical measurements) to enable reuse in cross-study monitoring and policy evaluation.
