# RECOUP-Moor Environmental data: Methodology

## Field Site
- Location: Stalybridge estate on Saddleworth Moor, a blanket bog near Manchester, UK.
- Ecology: Vegetation dominated by Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum.
- Event: Wildfire starting 24 June 2018, lasting six weeks, affecting 18 km² and causing large-scale removal of surface vegetation.

## Methods
- Plot design: 10 plots established in October 2018 at the post-fire site; each plot 10 m x 10 m.
- Burn severity: 5 plots with shallower (shallow burn) and 5 with deeper (deep burn) surface combustion; plots labeled S1-5, D1-5, with unburned/reference plots R1-5.
- Spatial and environmental data: Recorded geographical location, elevation, and slope; measured soil temperature at multiple time points over 24 months.
- Sampling timeline: Peat samples collected on 23 July 2019 from the surface of each plot (5 cm x 5 cm x 2 cm).
- Sample handling: Samples homogenized and stored at ~5 °C; dried at 70 °C for 72 hours and crushed into a fine powder.
- Chemical analyses:
  - Carbon and nitrogen: Three subsamples per plot, combusted at 1800 °C with a Vario Micro Cube to determine %C and %N; sub-sample results checked for homogeneity; average of the three subsamples used as the plot value.
  - Elemental composition: Two subsamples per plot analyzed by ICP-MS to determine the relative composition of 22 elements; average of the two subsamples used per plot.

## Variable Key
- Plot_number, Description: Plot Number; Plot_ID, Description: ID distinguishing plot feature and replicate (S1-5 = shallow burn, D1-5 = deep burn, R1-5 = unburned/reference)
- N_Coor, W_Coor: Latitude (N) and Longitude (W) coordinates
- Temp_Oct18, Temp_May19, Temp_Jul19: Soil temperature (°C) at 22/10/2018; 14/05/2019; 23/07/2019 respectively
- CN_ratio: Carbon to Nitrogen ratio
- C_cont, N_cont: Carbon and Nitrogen content (%) 
- Slope: Slope angle (°)
- Elevation: Elevation above sea level (m)
- Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, S, Si, Sr, Zn: Element contents (mg/g)
- Notes: Units provided in parentheses; for example, C_cont and N_cont in percent, temperatures in °C, elevation in meters, slope in degrees, and element concentrations in mg/g.
