# RECOUP-Moor Environmental data: Methodology

- Field Site
  - Stalybridge estate on Saddleworth Moor near Manchester, UK; blanket bog with vegetation dominated by Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum.
  - June 24, 2018 wildfire affected 18 km² and lasted six weeks, causing large-scale removal of surface vegetation.

## Methods
- Plot design and burn classification
  - Established 10 plots in October 2018, each 10 m x 10 m.
  - 5 plots identified as shallower (shallow burn) and 5 as deeper (deep burn); surface vegetation removed, leaving bare peat.
- Field data collected
  - Recorded geographical properties for each plot (location, elevation, slope).
  - Measured soil temperature at multiple time points over 24 months.
- Sampling and preparation
  - July 23, 2019: extracted peat samples from the surface of each plot (5 cm x 5 cm x 2 cm).
  - Samples homogenized and stored at ~5 °C until analysis.
  - For chemical analysis: dried peat at 70 °C for 72 hours, then crushed to a fine powder.
- Carbon and nitrogen analysis
  - Three subsamples per plot were combusted at 1800 °C to quantify carbon and nitrogen using a Vario Micro Cube (Elementar).
  - Subsamples checked for homogeneity; averages of the three subsamples used to produce one CN value per plot.
- Elemental analysis
  - Two subsamples per plot analyzed by ICP-MS to determine 22 elements; averages of the two subsamples used per plot.

## Variable Key
- Plot_number: Plot Number.
- Plot_ID: ID distinguishing plot feature and replicate (S1-5 = shallow burn, D1-5 = deep burn, R1-5 = unburned/reference).
- N_Coor: Latitude coordinate (N).
- W_Coor: Longitude coordinate (W).
- Temp_Oct18: Soil temperature on 22/10/18 (°C).
- Temp_May19: Soil temperature on 14/05/19 (°C).
- Temp_Jul19: Soil temperature on 23/07/19 (°C).
- CN_ratio: Ratio of Carbon to Nitrogen.
- C_cont: Carbon content (%).
- N_cont: Nitrogen content (%).
- Slope: Slope angle (°).
- Elevation: Elevation above sea level (m).
- Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, S, Si, Sr, Zn: Element content (mg/g) for each element.
