# Bunce' Scottish Pinewood Survey 2018-2022 Habitat, vegetation, tree and soil data from Native Pinewoods in Scotland, 2018-2022

## Overview
- Detailed ecological survey of Scotland’s native Scots Pine woodlands conducted 2018–2022, repeating a baseline from 1971 to enable environmental monitoring and change assessment.
- Surveys 27 major native pinewoods across northern Scotland, with 16 randomly selected 200 m² plots per wood.
- Standardised procedures and coding systems used to collect data on trees, ground flora, soil, and habitat types.
- Data intended to support long-term monitoring, policy evaluation, and environmental health assessments, with datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.

## Geographic and Time Coverage
- Geographic scope: Scotland (native Scots Pine woodlands).
- Time period: 2018–2022.
- Woods sampled: 27 identified native pinewoods (examples include Glentanar, Ballochbuie, Mar, Abernethy, Rothiemurchus, Glenmore, Shieldaig, Loch Maree, Black Mount, and others listed in the dataset).
- The survey mirrors and extends the 1971 baseline (and related surveys in 1973, 1971, 2000–2003, 2020–2022).

## Survey Design and Methods
- Sample design: All major native pinewoods identified in the 1959 baseline (Steven & Carlisle) included; 16 randomly assigned 200 m² quadrats per wood.
- Methods: Based on Bunce & Shaw (1973) with details in the National Woodland Survey & Native Pine Survey Field Handbook (Smart & Wood, 2021).
- Field procedures documented for reproducibility and cross-time comparability.

## Data Content and Structure

### Vegetation Data
- Three data categories per plot:
  - Trees, saplings & shrubs (recorded by individual trees; coppice stool groupings; dead indicators).
  - Vascular plants (recorded by species across nested quadrats 4 m², 25 m², 50 m², 100 m², 200 m²; % cover by species).
  - Bryophytes (ground bryophyte lists).
- Data collection uses nested quadrats and percent cover bands; species codes follow standard references.

### Soil Data
- Soil analyses per plot: pH and loss on ignition (LOI) for topsoil 0–15 cm.
- Sampling: centralized core method with standardized lab analyses; samples processed at Lancaster/CEH.

### Habitat Data
- Habitat types classified per predefined categories.
- Environmental context recorded: slope (degrees) and aspect (bearing).
- Additional contextual descriptions noted at site level; comprehensive habitat classification used across plots.

## Data Tables and Formats
- SCOTS_PINE_2022_SITES.csv: Approximate locations of surveyed woods (site IDs 1–27) with site names and grid references.
- SCOTS_PINE_2022_SITE_INFO.csv: Descriptions of surveyed sites (whole woodland) and plots (per-plot data), including habitat, animal, and tree descriptions; slope, aspect, and survey dates.
- SCOTS_PINE_2022_TREE_DATA.csv: Tree data per plot (DBH, species, tree type, dead indicator, etc.).
- SCOTS_PINE_2022_GROUND_FLORA.csv: Ground flora records for vascular plants and bryophytes; cover data for nested plots; growth forms and other qualifiers.
- SCOTS_PINE_2022_SOIL_DATA.csv: Plot soil data (pH in fresh and air-dried soil, LOI, sample date).
- Additional notes: Some sites include extra plots (up to 50 at Abernethy, site 4).

## Data Quality, Provenance and Access
- Uses established field methods and codings; field handbook (Smart & Wood, 2021) provides definitions and procedures.
- Survey team included multiple field surveyors; soil analyses conducted by UKCEH/Lancaster teams.
- Data designed to be comparable with the 1971 baseline and subsequent repeat surveys, enabling robust trend analyses.
- Related datasets and references provide historical context and methodological continuity.

## Implications for Monitoring and Policy
- Provides a longitudinal, standardized data framework for assessing environmental health in native pinewoods and the effectiveness of conservation strategies.
- Enables cross-time comparisons with historical datasets, facilitating monitoring of habitat change, vegetation dynamics, soil properties, and tree health.
- Supports data-driven decision making by enabling integration with other environmental data sources and making underlying data more accessible for broader use.
