# Field Handbook

- Aimed at standardized field surveying of broadleaved woodlands to update 1971 baseline data, with 2002 amendments and 2021 updates. Core tasks include soil sampling, understorey vegetation recording, DBH measurements of trees/shrubs/saplings, and site/plot attribute documentation to enable trend analysis and comparisons over time.

- Scope of data and sites
  - 16 random sampling points per site within a 14.14 x 14.14 m plot framework (200 m² per plot; 16 plots per site).
  - Data collected to mirror earlier surveys to allow detection of change; includes ground flora, bryophytes, tree regeneration, and canopy/dominant tree metrics.
  - Site-wide habitat and description data collected to contextualize plot data.

- Access, permissions, and relationships with landowners
  - Permissions coordinated by XSG Ltd; CEH provides permission letters and site maps.
  - Surveyors carry site ownership details, permission letters, and risk assessments; owners may require contact prior to surveys and may request vehicle registration details.
  - While permission refusals are rare, survey teams should respect owner instructions and document any access issues.

- Location and plotting strategy
  - 16 sampling points are depicted on a site map; exact re-location of original “X” points is not feasible due to historical imprecision.
  - Practical approach: derive current grid references from plot maps, use GPS to reach approximate point centers, verify with prior DBH and species cues, and proceed without excessive bias or relocation bias.
  - If conditions differ significantly from prior conditions, record change with notes but avoid selective sampling biases.

- Data collection methods and workflow
  - Electronic data capture preferred from 2020 onward using ESRI Survey123; offline GPS supported; photos and automatic location recording encouraged.
  - Paper forms available as backup; all data must be entered into the electronic system later.
  - Recording order: ground flora first (to minimize disturbance), then trees/shrubs/saplings, then soil sampling; site descriptions captured for the whole site.

- Survey tools and platforms
  - Survey123 (ArcGIS) used for field data collection; supports multiple forms and data validation; QR codes provided to load site and plot surveys; offline mode recommended for locations with poor connectivity.
  - Per-site and per-plot descriptive forms available; data can be submitted when online, with options to save drafts or send later.

- Plot layout and vegetation sampling (Ground Flora)
  - The 14.14 x 14.14 m plot is laid out with four corner posts; nested quadrats (Nest 1 to Nest 5) are surveyed to capture species presence and percent cover at multiple scales.
  - For each nest, record all vascular plants and common bryophytes (seedlings included in trees/shrubs categories); estimate percent cover to the nearest 5% (or mark as 'present' if below 5%).
  - Do not include trees/shrubs canopy in nest cover calculations; canopy data recorded separately on the Trees page.
  - Bryophyte sampling is selective and guided by Appendix I lists to avoid over-recording bryophytes from microhabitats (elevated on logs/rocks).

- Trees, saplings, and shrubs sampling
  - Trees: stems with DBH ≥ 5 cm; record species and DBH for all such stems within the plot, including multi-stemmed individuals (each stem counted; mark multi-stemmed accordingly); dead trees/stems are flagged.
  - Saplings: height >130 cm and DBH <5 cm; sampled only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 NE and 3 SW); apply same DBH recording rules as trees.
  - Shrubs: recorded in quarters 1 and 3 with selected shrub species; Hazel treated as shrub and restricted to quarters 1 and 3.
  - Disease recording: note tree diseases (e.g., Ash Dieback) and take photos if signs present; estimate % defoliation/leaf browning where possible.

- Soil sampling protocol
  - Take a 15 cm deep, 5 cm wide soil core from near the plot center (within 1 m) after removing surface litter/rocks as needed.
  - Label soil bags with site and plot identifiers; double-labelling recommended to minimize mislabeling.
  - Store samples cool; dispatch to CEH Lancaster promptly (ideally within the sampling week); include notes if sampling encountered problems.

- Plot completion and data integrity
  - After data collection, verify that all required forms are complete and correctly dated; check soil samples and equipment have been accounted for; ensure sampling holes are filled.
  - Document any site changes or access issues in the Notes field and/or Comments to support interpretation of changes.

- Data submission, tracking, and transparency
  - Online submission via Survey123 is preferred when connectivity exists; offline data can be saved as Drafts or Outbox and submitted later.
  - Each survey has a site description form and 16 plot forms; a separate site-wide description form captures broader habitat attributes.
  - Data can be resent if corrected; assets (photos, locations) are stored in the central database with metadata; keep track of versioning and flag the correct version in notes.

- Site Description and Habitat data
  - Site-level forms capture habitat attributes, site name, recorder, date, slope, aspect, and contextual notes.
  - Cross-checks ensure consistency between site and plot attributes (plot items present on site form; not every site attribute must be exhaustively searched in the whole site).

- Appendix-focused protocols and equipment
  - Appendix V: Field equipment lists (maps, GPS, compasses, soil bags, labeling materials, equipment for access and safety).
  - Appendix VII: Soil laboratory protocols for pH and loss on ignition (LOI) analyses, including sample preparation, drying, sieving, and calculation methods.
  - Appendices I–III: Bryophyte lists, backup forms, and old DBH recording sheets to support continuity with historical data.

- Data management and accessibility
  - Emphasis on traceability: track data sources, maintain metadata, and upload datasets to central portals with descriptive metadata.
  - The handbook notes the importance of accessible data for future analysis, including the potential to unify datasets across sites and years for robust pattern detection and decision-making support.
