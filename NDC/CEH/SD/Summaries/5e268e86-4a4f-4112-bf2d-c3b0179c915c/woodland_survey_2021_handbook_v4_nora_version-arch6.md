# Field Handbook

- Purpose and scope
  - Comprehensive field protocol for GB broadleaved woodland surveys (baseline 1971; amended 2002; updated 2021).
  - Aims to collect soil, understorey plant species, DBH of trees/shrubs/saplings, and plot attributes to enable long-term change analysis and data products for broader use.
  - Data intended for central storage and public/organisational use; supports data quality, comparability, and re-use.

- Data collection framework
  - Site and plots
    - Each site contains 16 randomly located plots arranged on a map; exact re-finding of old locations is not possible, but proximity to recorded centers is essential.
    - Plot size: 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m2); centre with four corner posts and diagonal strings to define nested subplots.
  - Plot and site attributes
    - Record slope, aspect, and habitat attributes; site-level data captured on a separate form.
    - Ground flora, bryophytes, and vascular plants recorded per nested quadrats; DBH for trees/shrubs/saplings recorded by plot quadrants.
  - Vegetation and ground flora (2.2)
    - Nested quadrats: Nest 1 (2 x 2 m), progressing through five nests to cover the full plot.
    - Record presence of all vascular plants and common bryophytes in each nest; estimate percent cover to nearest 5% (or “present” if <5%).
    - Total plot cover calculated across nests; bryophyte totals may be counted separately and then included in plot totals (double-counting caveat acknowledged).
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs (2.3)
    - Trees defined as stems ≥5 cm DBH; record species and DBH for all stems within the plot.
    - Saplings: height >130 cm but <5 cm DBH; recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (NE and SW).
    - Shrubs: recorded in NE and SW quarters; includes hazel as shrub.
    - Multi-stemmed individuals and dead trees/stems recorded with specific conventions.
  - Soil sampling (2.4)
    - Center of each plot; 15 cm deep core using a plastic tube (15 x 5 cm).
    - Remove fresh litter, take rocks as needed, ensure top flush with surface; label bags with site/plot details; cool transport; dispatch within a week.
  - Plot completion (2.5)
    - Post-survey checks: completeness, sample/gear counts, soil hole refill, and overall site/plot consistency.
  - Data submission and storage (2.6)
    - Electronic entry via Survey123 (offline GPS preferred) or paper backups.
    - Online submission via “Send Now”; offline allows “Drafts” and “Outbox”; auto-save features reduce data loss.
    - Central submission to CEH Lancaster/Lancaster University; per-site site description form submitted separately.

- Recording forms and data structure
  - Four main recording pages per site/plot category; detailed attribute definitions provided in Appendix IV.
  - Plot Description and Habitats (site-wide attributes mirrored at plot level for consistency).
  - Ground flora: presence and cover in nested quadrats; bryophyte selection guided by Appendix I.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: DBH, height, multi-stem handling, dead flags, and species notes.
  - Soil data: 15 cm core, labeling, sampling notes for any problems.
  - Site-level records include site description, habitats, and broader contextual notes.

- Data capture workflow and tools
  - Survey123 field app
    - Downloadable surveys; My Surveys hub shows Collect, Drafts, Outbox, and Sent sections.
    - GPS location capture (offline preferred); photos: canopy crop and four cardinal-direction photos; disease signs and other photos as needed.
    - Disease recording: options for “Other” if uncertain; optional photos of disease signs.
  - Backup paper forms
    - Paper templates available (Appendix II–IV) with instructions for later digitization.
  - Data quality considerations
    - Begin with ground flora to minimize disturbance; ensure correct nest and plot associations.
    - Check for possible misentries (blank or duplicate species); maintain consistent taxonomic naming.
    - If a site no longer woodland, still record and note land-use changes; avoid recording on built infrastructure.

- Permissions, access, and field logistics
  - Access managed by XSG Ltd; permissions often require owner contact, vehicle details, and possible permits or insurance/risk assessments.
  - Carry copies of permission letters and maps; document owner contacts and site access notes.
  - If land access is refused or altered (e.g., integration into gardens, motorway exclusion), create a plot entry with a Notes field detailing current land-use rather than recording understorey data.

- Storage, labeling, and transport of samples
  - Soil bags labeled with site and plot; double labeling recommended to prevent misidentification.
  - Soil dispatch to CEH Lancaster/Lancaster University; various delivery options; aim for arrival within the sampling week.
  - Ensure cooling and safe transport; note any sampling problems in field notes.

- Appendices and reference materials (highlights)
  - Bryophyte references: Appendix Ia (top 25 bryophytes from pilot sites) and Appendix Ib (common bryophytes in Great Britain).
  - Backup forms and templates: Appendix II (Vegetation plot backup sheet), Appendix III (DBH backup sheet), Appendix IV (Site Description and Habitats).
  - Field equipment list: Appendix V (equipment and transport considerations).
  - Soil analysis protocols: Appendix VII (lab procedures for pH and LOI).
  - Survey123 guidance: My Surveys, Drafts/Outbox/Sent workflow, and settings for offline/online use.

- Practical outcomes for data users
  - Produces harmonized, geo-spatially anchored data on woodland structure, ground flora, and soil properties for long-term monitoring.
  - Enables creation of dashboards, reports, and self-serve data products by combining plot- and site-level attributes across sites and years.
  - Supports documentation of woodland management, disease observations, habitat types, and regeneration status for policy and planning contexts.
