# Field Handbook

- Purpose: Establish a standardized, repeatable methodology for monitoring woodland environment by collecting soil, understorey vegetation, and tree-related data to support long-term environmental health assessment and policy evaluation.

## Aim and scope

- Take soil samples; record ground flora, DBH of trees, saplings and shrubs; document plot attributes and regeneration.
- Use consistent data formats to enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Emphasize data quality, verification, and storage in appropriate portals; employ standardised approaches across sites.

## Who uses this handbook

- Field survey teams operating under established monitoring responsibilities.
- Researchers and technicians with subject-matter and analytical skills, following standardised data collection protocols.

## Planning, permissions and access (Site logistics)

- Access and permissions coordinated by XSG Ltd; CEH provides permission letters and site maps.
- Always carry site ownership details, permission letters, and risk assessment; communicate with landowners as required (phone/email prior to survey).
- Some sites may require permits or Public Liability insurance; ensure these are handled before surveying.
- Documentation should include a site map with landowners and contact details; be prepared to adjust routes or access as directed.

## Sampling design and location (Sampling points)

- Each site contains 16 random sampling points (1–16) marked on a map.
- Plot locations are not re-found with perfect precision; aim to be as close as possible to the historic points.
- Use a GPS to reach the approximate point; derive grid references from the plot location map; use previous DBH data to judge proximity.
- Avoid bias in plot placement (do not move plots to chase a "typical" spot); where real change is suspected, document it with justification.

## Recording and data capture (General approach)

- Record data for each plot and site; ground flora and vegetation recorded before trees to minimize disturbance.
- If a site has changed land use or is no longer woodland, still record a plot entry with notes on current land use.
- Electronic data capture encouraged from 2020 onward using Survey123; paper forms available as backup.
- Survey123-compatible devices: smartphones, tablets, and offline GPS-enabled devices preferred.
- For paper backup, use waterproof forms and clutch pencils; Appendix IV contains full form details.

## Survey forms and data structure (Plot and site data)

- Site Description and Habitats Form: site-wide attributes (habitats, land use, accessibility) and a subjective site impression.
- Plot Description and Habitats Form: 16 plots per site; replicate structure to capture plot-specific attributes.
- Vegetation Plot – Ground Flora: record presence of vascular plants and bryophytes in nested quadrats within the 14.14 x 14.14 m plot; five nested quadrats (2 m, 5 m, 7.07 m, 10 m, 14.14 m diagonal equivalents) to capture % cover and presence.
- Trees, Saplings and Shrubs: record tree DBH (≥5 cm), species; saplings and shrubs recorded in designated diagonally opposite quarters (NE and SW) with same measurement conventions; multi-stemmed individuals and dead trees documented with specific rules.
- Soil Sampling: collect a single 15 cm deep soil core from the plot center; label bags with site and plot; keep samples cool and dispatch to CEH Lancaster promptly.
- Data fields include site name, plot number, recorder initials, date, slope, aspect, canopy/disease signs, photos, and notes.

## Plot layout and data collection details

- Plot layout: 14.14 x 14.14 m plot bounded by four corner posts; nested quadrats arranged using distance strings with labeled nests 1–5 (2 x 2 m to 200 m2 coverage).
- Ground Flora (Nest-based sampling): record all vascular plants and common bryophytes in nests; estimate % cover to the nearest 5% (or note as present if <5%), excluding trees and shrubs which are recorded separately.
- Bryophytes: record only a limited set of common bryophytes (Appendix I lists) that characterise understorey bryophyte communities; avoid bryophyte records on tree bases, logs, rocks, or microhabitats outside understorey context.
- Plot-level totals: after completing all nests, compute total cover for each species across the full plot; note that bryophyte totals may lead to double counting if bryophyte counts are included both individually and in total bryophyte.

## Trees, saplings and shrubs (DBH and classification)

- Trees: stems ≥5 cm DBH, capable of tree-like habit; record species and DBH for all stems within the plot; multi-stemmed individuals managed with a dedicated routine.
- Saplings: >130 cm in height but <5 cm DBH; recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters 1 (NE) and 3 (SW); use same DBH conventions.
- Shrubs: as defined by species; recorded in diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3; Hazel treated as shrub; record species and DBH as per trees where applicable.
- Dead trees and stumps: mark as Dead or indicate new/old stumps; follow the documented categorization for live/dead, stump age, and hollow status.

## Soil sampling and handling

- Collect top 15 cm soil cores from plot centers; avoid surface litter and rocks as much as possible; if rocky, extract from soil visible pockets.
- Label each bag with site and plot; ensure dual labeling to minimize mislabeling.
- If sampling difficulties arise, continue to other nearby areas within 1 m, then record any issues on the plot form.
- Transport soil samples in cool storage; dispatch to CEH Lancaster promptly to minimize degradation.

## Completion and data submission

- After data collection, verify forms for completeness; ensure site and plot numbers and dates are correct.
- Submit data via Survey123 when online using Send Now; offline data can be saved as Drafts or Outbox and submitted later; auto-save mitigates data loss.
- A separate site-level form captures site-wide description and habitats; ensure consistency between plot and site forms (site-level attributes present in plots, but not necessarily vice versa).
- The survey workflow includes My Surveys, Drafts, Outbox, and Sent sections for managing data submissions.

- General notes: Emphasis on avoiding sampling bias, documenting contextual observations, and recording any owner-operator details or changes in land use that may affect data interpretation.

## Data handling and sharing (Analyst-focused)

- Data are stored and uploaded to a central database (CEH Lancaster/Lancaster University) and are intended for long-term analysis and monitoring.
- Electronic data capture facilitates automatic location recording, photos, validation, and streamlined submission; paper backups exist for contingencies.
- Clear documentation of permissions, site conditions, and any notable land-use changes supports robust temporal comparisons and policy evaluation.
