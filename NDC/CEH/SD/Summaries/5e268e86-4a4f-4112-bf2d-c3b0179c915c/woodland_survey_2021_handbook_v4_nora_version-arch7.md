# Field Handbook

- Purpose and scope
  - Guidance for a legacy broadleaved woodland survey (GB) with amendments; aims to sample soils, record understorey plant species, measure DBH of trees, shrubs and saplings, and capture site/plot attributes near original locations.
  - Modern data capture emphasizes electronic recording (Survey123) with options for paper backups.

- Data capture and tools
  - Electronic data capture via Survey123 (ArcGIS) on smartphones, tablets, or Windows tablets with offline GPS preferred.
  - If electronics fail, paper forms (Appendix IV) are provided; data must subsequently be entered into digital forms.
  - Survey structure includes site-level forms and plot-level forms; each site has 16 plots (1–16) and a separate soil sample per plot.
  - Data submission supports online “Send Now,” offline “Send Later,” with auto-save and draft/outbox/sent workflows.

- Survey design and context
  - 16 random sampling points per site, located within a 14.14 m x 14.14 m vegetation plot (200 m2 total).
  - Nested ground-flora sampling across five quadrats (2x2 m, 5x5 m, 7.07x7.07 m, 10x10 m, 14.14x14.14 m) to capture species presence and cover estimates.
  - Ground flora collected before trees/shrubs and soils to minimize disturbance.
  - Ground-truthing relies on rough re-location toward the center of each previously recorded plot; precise re-finding is not feasible.

- Access, permissions, and field logistics
  - Access permissions coordinated by XSG Ltd; CEH provides permission letters and owner contact details.
  - Documentation and owner communications should be carried on site (maps, ownership lists, permission letters, risk assessments).
  - Avoid recording on built-over land (e.g., gardens, motorways); use sensible judgment for land-use changes since 1971–2002.

- Plot and site location guidance
  - Use provided site maps and grid references; derive GPS coordinates to locate plot centers as accurately as possible.
  - When re-finding plots, compare previous DBH and species signals to gauge location; do not bias plotting to avoid difficult terrains (e.g., dense thickets).

- Data collection workflow (Plot-focused)
  - Ground flora (Vegetation plot) first: record nested quadrats (Nest 1–5) for vascular plants, tree/shrub seedlings, and six additional categories (litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water, bryophytes).
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: record species and DBH for stems ≥5 cm in the four plot quarters; saplings recorded only in NE and SW quarters; shrubs similarly restricted to NE/SW.
  - Tree disease observations: document signs (e.g., ash dieback) and capture up to five disease photos; estimate % defoliation/leaf browning.
  - Soil sampling: collect a single 15 cm deep, 5 cm wide core per plot; pre-label soil bags with site and plot identifiers; avoid litter/rock interference; dispose of holes by filling and camouflaging.
  - Plot completion: verify forms, collect all samples, and ensure equipment is returned; note any site changes or permission limitations.

- Site description and habitat data
  - Site Description and Habitat Form captures broader site attributes, including plots' features, boundaries, and movement between plots.
  - Use comments section to note situational information (e.g., landowner remarks) to aid interpretation of change.

- Appendix references and data standards
  - Appendix V: Field equipment list (permits, maps, GPS, vegetation measurement tools, soil sampling gear, labeling materials).
  - Appendix IV: Site Description and Habitat attribute definitions; cross-checks between site and plot forms to avoid inconsistencies.
  - Bryophyte lists (Appendices Ia and Ib) provide guidance on recording top common bryophytes vs. common GB bryophytes.
  - Appendix VII: Soil analysis protocols (pH, LOI) and laboratory workflow for transport, processing, and calculations.

- Data handling and submission details
  - Online vs offline data submission: “Send Now” for online completion; “Drafts” and “Outbox” for offline work; “Sent” for submitted data.
  - Saved forms persist with auto-save; in case of device issues, data recovery through Survey123 is supported.
  - Site-level and plot-level forms must be logically consistent; plot attributes should be reflected on the site form.

- Fieldwork considerations and cautions
  - Be mindful of land-use changes since 1971; record current land-use in notes if plots can no longer be surveyed as woodland.
  - Confirm permissions and access on the day of survey; bring map and ownership details for verification.
  - Avoid introducing bias by altering plot locations to bypass difficult areas; maintain objective, randomized sampling intent.

- Photos and disease documentation
  - Take canopy photos from the plot center and four cardinal directions; up to five disease-related photos per plot, especially for tree diseases like Ash Dieback.

- Soil transport and analysis
  - Complete soil sample bags are dispatched to CEH Lancaster or Lancaster University; aim for arrival within a week; use cool storage until dispatch.

- Operational end-state
  - A comprehensive, georeferenced, multi-layered data package per site: site description, 16 plots with detailed vegetation and DBH data, soil analyses, and disease/photo documentation; ready for central database ingestion.
