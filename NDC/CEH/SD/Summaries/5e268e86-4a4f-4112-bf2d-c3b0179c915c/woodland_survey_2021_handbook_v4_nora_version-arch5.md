# Field Handbook

- A field methodology guide for the long-term broadleaved woodland survey in GB, amended from earlier baseline surveys (1971, 2002) and updated April 2021.
- Purpose: collect standardized soil, understorey vegetation, and woody structure data to enable comparison over time, with careful attention to permissions, data quality, and data management.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Focus

- Establishes a standardized data collection framework to ensure discoverable, usable, and up-to-date datasets across many sites.
- Permissions and access: landowner permissions coordinated by XSG Ltd; CEH issues permission letters and duty to contact owners; keep maps and owner details accessible on-site.
- Documentation and metadata: site and plot forms with detailed attribute definitions; cross-checks between site and plot data to ensure logical consistency.
- Data lifecycle: electronic recording preferred (Survey123) with offline capability and paper backups; central submission to a single database; clear pathways for drafts, offline work, and final submission.
- Data quality, bias, and reproducibility: guidance to minimize bias in plot placement and data interpretation; use historic DBH data to guide re-findings while acknowledging real change; emphasis on thorough notes to aid interpretation.

## Data Collection Standards and Metadata

- Site and plot scope:
  - Each site includes a site description/habitat form and 16 plots per site (arranged within a mapped area).
  - Plot layout is a 14.14 m x 14.14 m (200 m2) square with a defined center and four corner posts; nested 2x2 m to 25x25 m subplots are used for ground flora.
- Recording forms and datasets:
  - Site Description and Habitats form (site-wide attributes).
  - Plot Description and Habitats form (presence/absence of plot-level attributes).
  - Vegetation plot (Ground Flora) forms: five nested quadrats per plot; species presence and percent cover (to nearest 5%, with “present” for <5%).
  - Trees, Saplings and Shrubs: DBH measurements, species, and spatial quadrants; multi-stemmed entries and dead trees handled with consistent notation.
  - Soil sampling: one 15 cm deep core per plot, labeled bags, cool transport, and rapid dispatch to CEH Lancaster.
- Species lists and limitations:
  - Ground flora: focus on vascular plants plus common bryophytes; Appendix I/II provide bryophyte lists to standardize recording.
  - Tree disease: record suspected disease signs with photos; include defoliation/leaf browning estimates.
- Data annotation and guidance:
  - Recording forms include sections for comments to capture non-standard observations or context.
  - Photos: up to five disease/relevant site photos; canopy photo at plot center.

## Data Quality, Validation, and Bias Avoidance

- Location accuracy: aim as close as possible to historic plot centers; exact re-finding is not expected or required due to historical plotting limitations.
- Use of previous data: reference DBH and species from prior surveys to aid re-locating plots, but judge changes critically to avoid bias.
- Uniform data capture: avoid selective sampling or “homogenous” plot placement; maintain consistency with prior methods to support temporal comparisons.
- Biosecurity and practicality: do not record plots on built-over land or areas without permission; note land-use changes in the plot notes.

## Data Lifecycle, Submission, and Access

- Electronic data capture:
  - Survey123 (ArcGIS) used for site and plot forms; supports offline use with GPS; data auto-captured to improve accuracy and validation.
  - Mobile devices can upload data online; if offline, data saved as Drafts/Outbox and submitted later.
  - Central database submission via “Send Now”; ability to resend and track via Sent; auto-save features protect against data loss.
- Paper backup:
  - If electronic recording is not possible, paper templates exist (Appendix IV); data must be transcribed later into Survey123.
- Site and plot integrity:
  - Ensure site and plot IDs align; ensure soil bags are labeled with site/plot IDs; maintain consistent field notes for traceability.
- Soil sample handling and transport:
  - 16 soil cores per site; label bags, maintain cold chain, and dispatch to CEH Lancaster/Lancaster University within the same week when possible.

## Permissions, Access, and Site Logistics

- Coordination by XSG Ltd for landowner outreach and permissioning.
- On-site readiness:
  - Carry site maps, ownership details, and CEH permission letters; inform land managers or foresters as required.
  - Vehicle access details may be requested by landowners.
- Site safety and practicality:
  - Follow risk assessments; document any access constraints and reflect land-use changes in plot notes.

## Workflows and Practical Execution

- Location of sampling points:
  - 16 random sampling points per site; aim to approximate the original centre locations using the plot location map, GPS, and historical DBH cues.
  - If exact re-finding is not possible, proximity and consistency with nearest plots and DBH cues are used to justify location.
- Recording sequence:
  - Ground flora first (to minimize disturbance), then trees, saplings, and shrubs; soil samples taken after vegetation to minimize disturbance impact.
- Plot completion and integrity checks:
  - Confirm all forms are complete, sample bags accounted for, equipment accounted for, and soil holes filled.

## Equipment and Logistics (Overview)

- Field equipment: maps, compass, pulley/strings for plot layout, DBH tapes, 30 m tapes, center and corner posts, GPS-enabled device, and cameras for photos.
- Paper backups: printed survey forms and ammunition of backups (Appendix V equipment list).
- Sample handling: 16 soil bags per site, pre-printed labels, permanent marker, cool storage, and courier arrangements.

## Appendices and Protocol Highlights

- Appendix IV: Site Description and Habitats definitions; detailed attribute coding and cross-references for site vs plot forms.
- Appendix V: Field equipment list and site permissions documentation.
- Appendix VII: Soil analysis protocols (pH, LOI) and laboratory procedures; soil processing workflow from core to lab analysis.
- Survey123 guidance: My Surveys, collecting data, drafts, outbox, sent; offline work flows; map basemaps; and settings for data management.
- Appendices on bryophytes and vegetation plot backup forms to standardize species recording and ensure comparability with historical data.

## Endnotes and Practical Considerations

- Centralized data management emphasizes consistency, traceability, and long-term usability.
- CEH Lancaster is the designated destination for soil samples; weekend closures require planning to avoid delays.
- The field handbook underscores careful, consistent data capture and thorough documentation to maximize data usability for future analyses and governance.
