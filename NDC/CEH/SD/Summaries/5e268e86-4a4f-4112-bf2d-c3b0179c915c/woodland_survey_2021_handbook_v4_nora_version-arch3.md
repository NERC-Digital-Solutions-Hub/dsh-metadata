# Field Handbook

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides standardized methods for woodland health monitoring to support policy scrutiny, evaluation, and future decision-making.
  - Focuses on: soil sampling, understorey plant composition, tree/shrub regeneration (DBH and height), and plot/site attributes to track change relative to earlier surveys.

- Data collection framework
  - Emphasizes data quality, metadata, openness, and governance from the outset.
  - Encourages reuse and cross-site comparability by using consistent sampling designs, forms, and digital tools.
  - Addresses common barriers: data gaps, access constraints, organisational silos, and the need to publicly share datasets.

- Field sampling design and site structure
  - Each site comprises 16 randomly located sampling points (plots) marked on site maps.
  - Plot layout: a 14.14 m (200 m2) square with four corner posts; nested subplots defined by diagonally positioned markers to create five nests (2x2 m, 4x4 m, 5x5 m, 7.07x7.07 m, and the full 14.14 m square).
  - Aim is to follow rough prior locations as closely as possible to enable longitudinal comparison, while accepting some location uncertainty.
  - Location methods combine GPS references, map derived grid references, and comparison with previous DBH and species data to verify approximate position.

- Access, permissions, and field logistics
  - Permissions coordinated by XSG Ltd; CEH provides survey permissions and site maps; owners may require advance contact, permits, or insurance documentation.
  - Practical guidance includes having site ownership details handy, noting access constraints, parking, and any regulatory requirements.
  - Repeat visits should be planned to minimize disturbance and to respect owner instructions.

- Data collection methods and recording
  - Electronic data capture via ESRI Survey123 (with offline GPS capability) supported by paper backups when needed.
  - Site-level and plot-level forms: separate but linked data entries to ensure consistency between site description/habitats and plot data.
  - Data entry workflow: ground flora is recorded before trees/shrubs and before soil sampling to minimize disturbance; subsequent data capture follows in a controlled sequence.

- Plot data: vegetation (ground flora)
  - Ground flora is recorded within nested quadrats across the 14.14 m plot, starting with the innermost 2x2 m nest (Nest 1) and proceeding through four additional nesting areas to cover the full plot.
  - For each nest: identify all vascular plants and common bryophytes (seedlings included if present); enter presence and then estimate percentage cover to the nearest 5% or mark as present if under 5%.
  - Total plot cover is estimated after completing all nests, including litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water, and bryophytes; note that bryophyte totals may be double-counted in species and total bryophyte sums.
  - Bryophyte data are limited to a predefined list of common species (Appendix I) to ensure consistency and comparability; avoid bryophytes on tree bases, logs, or rocks unless clearly part of the understorey.

- Plot data: trees, saplings, and shrubs
  - Trees: record species and DBH (cm) for all stems ≥5 cm within the 14.14 m plot; treat multi-stemmed individuals with per-stem DBH entries and indicate multi-stem status.
  - Saplings: height >130 cm and <5 cm DBH; recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 NE and 3 SW) with same DBH and multi-stem conventions.
  - Shrubs: recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); Hazel treated as shrub; specific shrub species are selected from a predefined list.
  - Dead trees or stems are flagged; recordings distinguish live vs. dead stems.

- Plot data: soil sampling
  - A core to a depth of 15 cm is taken at the center of each plot (or as close as possible within 1 m).
  - Samples are labeled with site and plot identifiers; double labeling is recommended to avoid mislabeling.
  - Soil collection protocol includes removing fresh litter, exposing decomposed material, and avoiding rocks; if insufficient soil is obtained, areas nearby may be sampled within 1 m.
  - Samples are stored cool and dispatched promptly to CEH Lancaster/Lancaster University.

- Data submission and governance
  - Online data submission via Survey123 (“Send Now”) when online; offline submission via Drafts/Outbox with subsequent upload.
  - If needed, a central site description form accompanies the plot data to capture site-wide attributes.
  - Data integrity checks emphasize preventing missing major items, ensuring correct site/plot identifiers, and documenting survey date and personnel.
  - Survey data are stored centrally; responsibility for data sharing, metadata, and governance rests with the monitoring program operators.

- Technology, training, and backups
  - Survey123 provides structured, auditable forms with GPS capture, photo attachments, and integration with central databases.
  - Paper forms remain a backup option and are illustrated in Appendix IV; technicians must enter paper data into digital forms later.
  - Field teams are advised to carry device batteries, power packs, and physical maps; gear lists and equipment are detailed in Appendix V.

- Practical considerations, quality, and interpretation
  - Acknowledges that plot locations are approximate due to historical recording methods; analyses should account for spatial uncertainty.
  - Changes in land use since baseline surveys are anticipated; notes should capture land-use changes where plots can no longer be surveyed as originally defined.
  - Clear guidance on avoiding bias: avoid selective pacing to circumvent difficult terrain, and use judicious interpretation when real ecological change is suspected.
  - Documentation of owner interactions, permissions, and site-specific conditions is encouraged to aid interpretation.

- Core outcomes for monitoring and policy use
  - Standardized measures of woodland health: soil chemistry (pH, LOI), understorey composition, regeneration dynamics, and structural indicators (DBH, canopy-related data via sampling scheme).
  - A repeatable framework that supports trend analysis, data comparability across sites, and evidence-based evaluation of woodland health interventions and policy impacts.
