# Field Handbook

## Overview
- A comprehensive field survey protocol for amending and updating baseline broadleaved woodland data in GB.
- Collects multiple data types per site: soil, understorey vegetation, trees/shrubs/saplings, plot attributes, and site descriptions.
- Designed for repeat surveys (1971 baseline; 2002 amended; ongoing future work) to assess change over time.
- Emphasises data integrity, documentation, and traceability across field, laboratory, and central repositories.

## Data Collection Framework
- Survey scope: 16 random sampling points per site and 16 plots per site (14.14 x 14.14 m plots; 200 m² each).
- Data categories (recording forms):
  - Site Description and Habitats (site-wide attributes; cross-site consistency with plot data).
  - Plot Description and Habitats (presence/absence of plot attributes within each site plot).
  - Vegetation Plot: Ground Flora (4 nested quadrats per plot to capture species presence and cover; bryophyte notes limited to common species lists).
  - Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs (DBH, species, and health; disease signs; multi-stemmed entries; dead trees).
  - Soil Sampling (center of plot; 15 cm depth cores; lab labels and disposal protocols).
  - Completion and submission steps (site-wide and per-plot datasets; notes for interpretation).
- Bryophyte datasets and common lists provided (Appendix Ia, Ib) to standardise recording.

## Data Capture Workflow
- Primary tool: Survey123 (ArcGIS) for electronic data capture; offline GPS capability; integrated photo capture; data validation and central submission.
- Backup plan: paper recording forms with subsequent digital entry if electronic devices fail.
- Data entry sequence:
  - Record ground flora first (before trees/shrubs and soils).
  - Document plot-level attributes (slope, aspect) and central GPS location.
  - Capture canopy photos and disease signs; airway disease observations documented with photos if needed.
  - Record vegetation data across nested quadrats (Nest 1 to Nest 5) and compute total plot cover.
  - Record trees, saplings, and shrubs by plot quadrant (NE and SW are priority for saplings/shrubs; other quadrants for trees).
  - Collect 16 soil samples per site; label bags with site/plot information; store and dispatch to CEH Lancaster.
- Data validation and orientation:
  - Learn and use the location averaging tool to improve coordinate accuracy; account for GPS errors and historical plot relocation limitations.
  - Ensure alignment between site and plot forms (attributes present on plot form must be represented on the site form).

## Location, Permissions, and Field Logistics
- Permissions handled by XSG Ltd; compile landowner contact details; permissions documented with CEH letters; prepare vehicle access notes and contact details for landowners.
- Plot locations are approximate due to historical recording methods; aim for the rough centre of each designated “X” on historical maps; use GPS to approximate, with a tolerance for minor deviations.
- Do not record on land with built structures or disallowed access; avoid railway embankments or motorway verges; adapt to land-use changes while maintaining data traceability.

## Data Standards, Metadata, and Quality
- Four main recording pages per site/plot; Appendix IV details attribute definitions and context.
- Consistency checks:
  - Plot attributes must correspond to site attributes; ensure logical consistency across forms.
  - Use standard species names and controlled lists; handle unknown species with “Other” entries and subsequent updates.
- Documentation and metadata:
  - Include recorder initials, date, site/plot IDs, slope/aspect, and soil sampling reminders.
  - Comments sections are encouraged to capture contextual information that may aid interpretation of change.
- Data accessibility and reuse:
  - Central database (UKCEH CEH Lancaster) houses the collected data; electronic submission preferred; paper backups retained as needed.
  - Structure supports longitudinal comparisons (1971 baseline, 2002 repeat surveys, ongoing updates).

## Equipment, Workflows, and Lab Protocols
- Field equipment (Appendix V): maps, plot marking kit, compass, DBH tapes, tapes, GPS-enabled devices, cameras, labels, and soil bags.
- Soil analysis protocol (Appendix VII): lab procedures for pH, LOI, drying, sieving, and calculation methods; samples returned to CEH Lancaster or Lancaster University.
- Survey123 workflows:
  - Off-line data capture with GPS; QR code scanning to load site and plot forms; geo-tagged photos stored with entries.
  - Data submission: online send when connected; offline work saved as drafts; auto-save minimises data loss.
- Data management and recovery:
  - My Surveys provides collection, drafts, outbox, and sent records; favourite answers feature supports re-use of validated responses.

## End-to-End Data Lifecycle and Usage
- Data lifecycle:
  - Field data collection → central database submission → site and plot metadata alignment → longitudinal comparisons across survey waves.
  - Site-level and plot-level attributes enable interpretation of habitat changes, forest structure, and ground flora dynamics.
- Potential impact for data leaders:
  - Demonstrates a robust, repeatable data pipeline from field collection to centralized storage.
  - Emphasizes governance, standardization, and documentation to enable reuse across networks and by policy/partner teams.
  - Provides explicit handling of data gaps, access barriers, and changing land-use contexts to support credible analysis and reporting.

## Key Takeaways for Data Leaders
- The Field Handbook outlines a structured, standards-driven approach to collecting multi-layered woodland data, with clear data governance from permissions to submission.
- It leverages mobile data capture (Survey123) to enhance data quality and timeliness while offering a paper backup for resilience.
- Repeated survey design and extensive metadata capture enable monitoring of ecological change over decades, suitable for data-driven decision-making and cross-network collaboration.
- Challenges highlighted include dispersed data sources, data gaps at granular levels, access restrictions, and maintaining alignment between historical and current datasets.
