# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from South Basin of Windermere 2021 - 2022

## Overview
- Ongoing monitoring dataset from the South Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Fortnightly sampling from January 2021 to end of 2022.
- Measured variables: surface temperature (TEMP, °C), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG, % air-saturation), Secchi depth (SECC, m), alkalinity (ALKA, µg CaCO3 per L), pH, ammonium (NH4N, µg N/L), nitrate (NO3N, µg N/L), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P, µg P/L), total phosphorus (TOTP, µg P/L), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2, µg/L), phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA, µg/L).

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Water samples integrated from 0 to 7 m.
- Collected from a boat at a buoy in the deepest part of the lake.
- Location: South Basin, Windermere.
- Data available to download in CSV format with specified variable descriptions and units.

## Quality control and data status
- Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Double-entered and visually checked.
- Missing data attributed to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Data structure and content
- Data delivered as CSV with columns: Date, Description (variable name), Variable (description), Value, Sign(if<LOD), Description (note on below-detection-limit values).
- Variables and units as listed above; below-detection-limit values indicated with a < sign.

## Data availability, metadata, and governance
- Data collection funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) award NE/R016429/1 as part of UK-SCaPE (National Capability).
- Data validation funded by NERC award NE/Y006208/1 as part of ACCESS-UK (National Capability).
- Emphasis on transparency and data sharing, with raw data requiring subsequent quality assurance and metadata completion for reuse.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Provides key environmental health indicators (temperature, oxygen, clarity, water chemistry, chlorophyll a) for evaluating ecosystem status and informing policy decisions.
- Supports data-driven decision making, governance, and stakeholder reporting.
- Highlights the need for robust metadata and quality assurance to maximize usability across monitoring frameworks and datasets.

## Limitations and considerations for use
- Requires quality control/calibration before formal interpretation.
- Potential data gaps due to weather, pandemics, or staff constraints.
- Handling of values below detection limits needed during analysis.
- Metadata completeness and harmonization considerations to enable integration with other datasets and governance processes.
