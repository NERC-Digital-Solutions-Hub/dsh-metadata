Feuchtmayr, H., Carter, H.T., Clarke, M.A., Dodd, B.A., James, J.B., Keenan, P.O., Kelsall, M., Mackay, E.B., McShane, G., Rankin, G., Rhodes, G., Thackeray, S.J., Maberly, S.C. (2025)

## Overview
- Ongoing fortnightly monitoring dataset for Windermere (South Basin), Cumbria, England.
- Variables captured: surface temperature (TEMP, °C), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG, % air-saturation), Secchi depth (SECC, m), alkalinity (ALKA, µg CaCO3/L), pH, ammonium (NH4N, µg N/L), nitrate (NO3N, µg N/L), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P, µg P/L), total phosphorus (TOTP, µg P/L), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2, µg/L), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA, µg/L).
- Timeframe: January 2021 – end of 2022.
- Data available for download as CSV with defined units and descriptions.

## Data scope and variables
- Measurements collected from a boat at a marked buoy in the deepest part of the lake, sampling integrated from 0 to 7 m.
- Units specified for each variable, with detection-limit indicators where applicable.
- Data structure designed to support reuse and cross-parameter analyses.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling regime as part of an ongoing monitoring program.
- Location: South Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Sampling method: boat-based at buoy, deepest location; integrated 0–7 m depth.
- Timeframe and cadence aligned with the UK national capability programs.

## Quality control and data validity
- Current data are raw and have not yet undergone quality control and calibration.
- Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
- Missing data attributed to weather conditions, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Data structure and accessibility
- Data provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns include:
  - Date: date of measurement
  - Description: variable name
  - Value: measured value
  - Sign(if<LOD): indicator for values below detection limit
- The dataset includes a clear indicator for measurements below detection limits.
