# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from South Basin of Windermere 2021 - 2022

## Purpose and scope
- Fortnightly monitoring dataset from the South Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Timeframe: January 2021 to end of 2022.
- Variables included: surface temperature (TEMP, °C), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG, % air-saturation), Secchi depth (SECC, m), alkalinity (ALKA, µg CaCO3 per L), pH; nutrients and pigments: ammonium (NH4N, µg N/L), nitrate (NO3N, µg N/L), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P, µg P/L), total phosphorus (TOTP, µg P/L), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2, µg/L), phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA, µg/L).
- Sampling method: integrated 0–7 m water column, collected from a boat at the deepest part of the lake, at a marked buoy location.

## Data quality and limitations
- Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
- Gaps and missing values arise from weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Data structure and format
- Delivered as CSV with columns:
  - Date: measurement date.
  - Variable, Description: label for each measurement (e.g., TEMP, OXYG, SECC, ALKA, pH, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA).
  - Value, Description: measurement values.
  - Sign(if<LOD), Description: indicates if values are below detection limit (uses “<” sign).
