# Supporting Document Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from South Basin of Windermere 2021 - 2022

## Overview
- Ongoing fortnightly monitoring of surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a in the South Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Data available to download as a CSV; raw data have not yet undergone full quality control or calibration.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Timeframe: January 2021 to end of 2022.
- Sampling frequency: Fortnightly.
- Location and method: Measurements collected from a boat at a marked buoy in the deepest part of the lake.
- Water depth sample: Integrated from 0 to 7 meters.
- Variables and units (as recorded):
  - TEMP: surface temperature in degrees Celsius
  - OXYG: surface oxygen saturation in % air-saturation
  - SECC: Secchi depth in metres
  - ALKA: alkalinity in µg CaCO3 per litre
  - pH: pH
  - NH4N: ammonium in µg N per litre
  - NO3N: nitrate in µg N per litre
  - PO4P: soluble reactive phosphate in µg P per litre
  - TOTP: total phosphorus in µg P per litre
  - SIO2: dissolved reactive silicon in µg per litre
  - TOCA: phytoplankton chlorophyll a in µg per litre
- Data structure in dataset: CSV with Date, Description (variable), Value, and Sign(if<LOD) columns (Sign indicates values below detection limit with a < sign).

## Quality control and data handling
- Status: Data are raw and not yet quality controlled or calibrated.
- Quality checks performed: Double entry and visual checks.
- Gaps: Missing data due to weather conditions, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Data structure and availability
- Data format: Comma separated values (CSV) with variables described above.
- Availability: Data can be downloaded; intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
