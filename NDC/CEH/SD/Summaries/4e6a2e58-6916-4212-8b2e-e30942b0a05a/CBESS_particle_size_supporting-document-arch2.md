# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) sediment particle size in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats..

## Overview
- A CBESS dataset measuring sediment particle size across mudflat and saltmarsh habitats.
- Data derived from 6 sites over 2 locations, with samples from two habitats per site.
- Winter and summer 2013 sampling as part of CBESS field campaign; no planned repeats.

## Study design and locations
- Sites and locations:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM)
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS)
- Habitats: Mudflat and Saltmarsh at each site
- Sampling framework:
  - 3 replicates across 22 quadrats
  - 4 spatial scales (A: 1 m; B: 1–10 m; C: 10–100 m; D: 100–upper limit)
- Habitat and sediment contrasts:
  - Saltmarsh: two contrasting soil types (clay in Essex; sandy soils in Morecambe Bay)
  - Mudflat contrasts: Essex with cohesive clays/mud/silt vs Morecambe with coarse, mobile sediments
- Personnel: Christina Wood and Martin Solan

## Temporal coverage and repeat sampling
- Sampling occurred in winter and summer 2013
- No planned repeat sampling for this dataset

## Measurement methods and protocols
- Variable observed: Sediment particle size
- Field collection:
  - Mudflat: surface sediment scrapes
  - Saltmarsh: sediment sampled from 2 cm below the surface
- Sample handling: Frozen at -20°C prior to analysis
- Analytical method: Malvern Mastersizer particle size analysis
- Protocol references: Malvern Mastersizer procedures; calibration and detailed methods linked in linked resources

## Data formats and sources
- File formats: CSV (with notes on other formats)
- Background and protocol references:
  - PSD analysis details and calibration: linked web pages
  - Full article and foundational references (e.g., Blott & Pye, 2001) cited
- Data management context: Part of the CBESS field campaign data outputs

## Data structure and field descriptions
- Core identifying fields:
  - Row Number; Season (Winter W, Summer S); Location (Morecambe M, Essex E); Site (CS, WS, AH, FW, TM); Habitat (Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM); Quadrat Number (1–22); Scale (A–D); Replicate (1–3); Measurement Type (PSA)
- Particle size metrics (examples):
  - d(0.050), d(0.160), d(0.5), d(0.840), d(0.950) in micrometers (µm)
  - D [4, 3]µm (equivalent spherical volume mean)
  - Inclusive mean, inclusive kurtosis, inclusive standard deviation, inclusive skewness (Phi and µm scales)
  - Percent clay across size fractions (e.g., fractions from <63 µm to finer fractions)
  - Detailed size-class fractions ranging from very fine silt to very coarse sand
- Data interpretation notes:
  - Size distributions provided in both phi units and micrometers
  - Detailed breakdowns for clay content and other particle-size fractions across multiple size bands

## Data quality, calibration, and QA
- Calibration and QA:
  - Calibration and QA procedures referenced to PSD methodology pages and standard references
  - Quality control steps referenced through linked technique pages
- Data verification:
  - Observations and measurements follow standardized field and lab procedures
  - Detailed field descriptions and data dictionary included to support reproducibility

## Outputs, usage, and accessibility
- Outputs presented as standardized datasets (CSV) suitable for monitoring analyses and trend assessment
- Dataset designed to be integrated with other CBESS environmental datasets for broader monitoring and policy evaluation
- Accessibility notes:
  - Protocols, calibration details, and data dictionaries available via linked web resources
  - Full article and associated references linked for methodological context

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and analysis
- Provides structured, comparable sediment-size data across contrasting coastal habitats and regions
- Supports evaluation of sediment characteristics in relation to habitat type, inundation regimes, and soil differences
- Aids in cross-site comparisons and time-series analyses within CBESS monitoring framework
- Highlights the importance of expanding data reuse beyond single-use analyses to amplify dataset value across environmental health assessments
