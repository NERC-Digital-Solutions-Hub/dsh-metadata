# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) sediment particle size in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats.

## Overview
- Purpose: Document sediment particle size data collected across CBESS study sites to understand mudflat and saltmarsh sediment characteristics.
- Scope: 6 sites over 2 locations, 2 habitats (mudflat and saltmarsh), sampled in winter and summer 2013; 3 replicates across 22 quadrats at 4 spatial scales.
- Primary staff: Christina Wood and Martin Solan.

## Location and Habitat Context
- Locations and sites:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW)
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS)
- Coordinates provided for observation sites.
- Habitat and soil contrasts:
  - Saltmarsh: contrasting soil types (clay in Essex; sandy in Morecambe Bay) with differing inundation frequency, creek structure, and vegetation.
  - Mudflat: Essex sites with cohesive clays, mud, silt; Morecambe sites with coarser, mobile sediments.

## Sampling and Monitoring
- Field campaign: Part of the general CBESS fieldwork conducted in winter and summer 2013.
- Repeat sampling: No repeats planned for these sites/time points.
- Procedures:
  - Mudflat samples: surface sediment scrapes.
  - Saltmarsh samples: sediment scraped from 2 cm below surface.
  - Sample handling: samples frozen at -20°C prior to analysis.
  - Analysis methodology: particle size analysis following Malvern Mastersizer protocol; calibration and methodology linked to external resources.

## Data Collected
- Primary variable: Sediment particle size distributions (PSD).
- Data format: CSV file(s).
- Data documentation and sources:
  - Protocols and calibration details available via linked resources.
  - PSD methodology references include Blott & Pye (2001) and related tool pages.
  - Full article and technique references available through provided links.

## Dataset Structure and Field Descriptions
- Core metadata:
  - Row Number: sorting index for original input order.
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S).
  - Location: Essex (E) or Morecambe (M).
  - Site: Morecambe CS/WS; Essex AH/FW.
  - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM).
  - Quadrat Number: 1–22.
  - Scale: A/B/C/D representing spatial scales (1 m up to larger extents).
  - Replicate: 1–3.
  - Measurement Type: PSA (Particle Size Analysis).
- PSD measurements and descriptors:
  - Percentiles: d(0.050), d(0.160), d(0.5), d(0.840), d(0.950) in µm.
  - D[4,3] µm and inclusive mean (Phi) with related statistics (inclusive kurtosis, inclusive skewness, inclusive standard deviation).
  - Micro-scale descriptors in Phi and µm (mean, kurtosis, skewness, software-calculated statistics).
  - Clay fraction and other size-binned fractions across a detailed ladder of size ranges (e.g., %Clay in various µm bins; %Very fine silt to %Coarse sand across multiple intervals).
- Note: The dataset includes extensive, multi-level PSD descriptions and derived statistics to characterize particle-size distribution across samples.

## Data Quality, Provenance, and Documentation
- Quality control: Data checking procedures referenced via linked documentation.
- Procedures and calibration: Detailed methodology and calibration guidance linked (PSD protocol pages and supporting literature).
- Documentation of methods: Full citation and access to techniques (e.g., Malvern Mastersizer protocol, Blott & Pye 2001 for particle size analysis).
- Accessibility of methods: External links provided for full protocol, calibration, and related literature.

## Access, Reuse, and Updates
- Dataset intended to be uploaded to relevant data portals and catalogues as part of CBESS data sharing.
- Documentation includes explicit variable definitions and method references to support reuse by data users and other stakeholders.
- Planned updates: Not indicated; sampling planned as part of the 2013 CBESS field campaign with no repeats scheduled for these observations.
