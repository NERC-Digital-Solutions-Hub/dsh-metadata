# Frame Modelling

## Overview
- FRAME is a Lagrangian atmospheric transport model used to assess annual mean deposition of reduced and oxidised nitrogen over the United Kingdom.
- Utilises a multi-layer vertical diffusion scheme (33 layers) within a 1 km x 1 km UK/Ireland domain; outputs are masked to land cells in the UK.
- Outputs include wet and dry deposition of NHx and NOy at 1 km resolution, with deposition to forest, moorland, and grid-average land-cover categories.

## Data inputs and sources
- Emissions inputs sourced from the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI): 160 subsectors, aggregated into 11 SNAP sectors, for NH3, NOx, and SO2 (diffuse and point sources).
- UK agricultural NH3 emissions estimated annually from census data, farming practices, and emission source strength data; emissions distributed at 1 x 1 km using land-cover weighting.
- Ireland emissions taken from CLRTAP/EMEP data for 2016, scaled to year totals using MapEire at 1 km x 1 km; boundary conditions use wider European emissions (50 km x 50 km) from CLRTAP/EMEP.
- Boundary conditions generated by eight simulations per year with 45-degree directional resolution.
- Meteorology and ancillary data: wind from radiosondes or WRF model outputs; rainfall data; Land Cover Map 2015; land-cover-specific deposition velocities for five land-cover types (forest, moorland, grassland, arable, urban).

## Data outputs and structure
- Deposition outputs are provided for two land-cover categories (forest and moorland) and as a grid-average (weighted by the land-cover mix in each 1 km grid cell).
- Annual deposition values are expressed as kilograms of nitrogen per hectare per year (kg N ha-1 year-1).
- Data are delivered as 28 CSV files named ASSIST_N_dep_kgha_xxxx.csv, where xxxx = year (1990–2017).
- File structure and fields (example):
  - easting (metres) and northing (metres): center coordinates of the 1 km grid square (OS British National Grid).
  - grd_NHx_dry, grd_NOy_dry: grid-total dry deposition of reduced and oxidised N.
  - grd_NHx_wet, grd_NOy_wet: grid-total wet deposition of reduced and oxidised N.
  - for_NHx_dry/for_NOy_dry, for_NHx_wet/for_NOy_wet: forest-only deposition equivalents.
  - mor_NHx_dry/mor_NOy_dry, mor_NHx_wet/mor_NOy_wet: moorland-only deposition equivalents.
- All values are in kg N ha-1 year-1; NA indicates no-data values.

## Data quality and validation
- Model outputs evaluated against the UK Acidifying and Eutrophying Atmospheric Pollutants (UKEAP) network.
- FRAME has undergone extensive peer review and contributed to Defra model inter-comparison exercises; widely published in the peer-reviewed literature.

## Data access and provenance
- Resource and access: UK Acidifying and Eutrophying Atmospheric Pollutants network information page (URL provided in documentation).
- Supporting information and model outputs are documented with references to NAEI, CLRTAP/EMEP, MapEire, and Land Cover Map datasets; data are prepared for UK and Ireland domain applications and model boundary conditions.

## Practical governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Data provenance and reproducibility:
  - Track model version, input inventories (NAEI SNAP classifications, CLRTAP/EMEP data, MapEire), land-cover datasets (LC Map 2015), and boundary condition sources.
  - Document per-year processing steps: weighting by land cover, grid-averaging, and file naming conventions.
- Metadata and standards:
  - Ensure clear metadata for units (kg N ha-1 year-1), grid resolution (1 km), domain extent, and land-cover classifications (forest, moorland, grid-average).
  - Maintain consistent file structure across the 28 annual files (1990–2017) for interoperability.
- Data availability and updates:
  - Be aware that the current product covers 1990–2017; plan governance for potential extension or updates beyond 2017.
  - Manage access to large, multi-source inputs and ensure licensing/usage terms are clear.
- interoperability and integration:
  - Maintain compatibility with related data products (emissions inventories, boundary conditions, land-cover maps) to support integrated analyses.
  - Ensure naming conventions, coordinate systems, and units are consistent to enable reuse in other datasets and models.
- Quality assurance and traceability:
  - Preserve QC documentation, peer-review history, and inter-comparison records to support user confidence.
  - Link outputs to corresponding input datasets and boundary conditions for traceability.
