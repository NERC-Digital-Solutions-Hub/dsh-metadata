# 1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

- Purpose of NPMS
  - A national plant monitoring survey to learn where wild plants grow, how habitats change, and to use plants as indicators of the state of the natural environment.
  - Aims to provide statistically robust data and annual feedback on results to inform policy and decision-making.

- Partnership and governance
  - Run by a collaboration of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI), Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), and Plantlife.

- Data use and accessibility
  - Outputs support annual reporting on habitat trends and environmental status.
  - Data governance emphasizes sharing underlying data, with recognition of potential barriers to public data access and metadata quality.

- How the survey works (high level)
  - Monitors abundance of selected plant sets within fixed plots across 28 fine NPMS habitats (grouped into 11 broad categories).
  - Plants are chosen as habitat indicators (positive or negative) for assessing habitat quality.
  - Each habitat has a target species list; data are collected to detect changes in plant communities over time.

- What volunteers are provided
  - A allocated kilometre square with a map, a species guide, NPMS Species List, monitoring forms, and access to the NPMS website for data entry and support.

- Survey cadence and participation
  - Volunteers visit plots twice per year (late spring/early summer and late summer).
  - In the first year, a reconnaissance visit is recommended to locate plots and learn the square.

- Data submission
  - Data entered online via www.npms.org.uk; alternative submission by mailing recording forms if online entry is not possible.

- What to do if species are absent or habitats change
  - Recording fewer target species remains valuable; an online facility allows recording additional species of interest, though these extras do not feed into habitat-quality metrics.
  - If habitat changes over time, assign the appropriate NPMS habitat list for each survey; continue monitoring plots even if they shift out of the scheme, where possible.

- Multiple squares
  - If managing multiple squares and cannot survey every year, alternate years are allowed, ensuring at least one square is surveyed in any given year. Maximum allocation is five squares per volunteer.

- Survey levels
  - Wildflower Level: recording a smaller subset of species.
  - Indicator Level: broader, robust indicator species set.
  - Inventory Level: Indicator Level plus recording all other vascular plants present.
  - Progression through levels is encouraged to increase data robustness.

- Plot and habitat selection
  - Most plots are 5x5 m squares (woodlands 10x10 m); linear plots are 1x25 m.
  - Preference for plots within pre-selected locations that match NPMS habitat types; each plot should remain within a single habitat.
  - In cases where pre-selected locations are unsuitable, Protocol A (self-selection) allows representative placement within the habitat, prioritising relocatability.

- Ponds, streams, and other features
  - Ponds and flushes can be surveyed as linear plots; accessibility and safety considerations apply.
  - Linear plots can be placed along features such as hedgerows, margins, or water bodies; ponds count as linear plots regardless of grid intersections.

- Ponds, margins, verges, hedgerows, and water bodies
  - Specific plotting guidance provided for arable margins, road verges, hedgerows, standing and running waters, springs and flushes, and other habitats to ensure consistent sampling.

- Plot setup and relocation
  - Emphasis on creating field sketches and photos to aid future relocation.
  - Documentation should include compass direction, permanent features, and photograph orientation.
  - GPS can improve location accuracy but should not replace field notes and sketches.

- Equipment and field methods
  - Typical plotting equipment includes tape measures, corner markers, recording forms, a clipboard, GPS/compass, camera, pencils.
  - Photos and sketches are recommended for relocation and change detection.

- Recording method (across all plots)
  - Use the appropriate habitat species list to record species present.
  - For square plots: search efficiently from a corner and expand coverage to the whole plot; for linear plots: start at the intersection with a gridline and move along the feature.
  - Abundance (percent cover) is estimated for each species using the Domin scale (detailed in the guide).
  - Record percentages for bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen.
  - Optional but encouraged: vegetation height, woodedness, aspect, slope, and management signs (e.g., grazing, mowing, hedge-cutting) with standardized interpretations for grazing intensity.

- Data entry and administration
  - Use one survey form per plot; submit data online when possible.
  - If online submission is not possible, mail forms to the NPMS Volunteer Coordinator.

- Access, safety, and responsibilities
  - Volunteers should respect the countryside, other users, and the environment; follow country-specific access codes (England/Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland).
  - An NPMS introduction letter is available to help gain landowner permission if needed.
  - Personal health and safety are the responsibility of the volunteer; plan for weather, risk, and remote locations, and consider working with a buddy.

- Health and safety guidance
  - Check weather forecasts in advance; avoid unsafe areas (e.g., cliff edges, unstable slopes).
  - Carry a mobile phone (not guaranteed to work in remote areas) and a first-aid kit; wear appropriate clothing and footwear; inform someone of planned locations and timings.

- Appendix 1: Habitat types
  - 28 fine NPMS habitats (grouped into 11 broad categories) with descriptive guidance to help select the correct habitat and corresponding species lists.
  - Examples cover arable margins, bogs and wet heath, broadleaved woodlands, coast, fresh water, heathland, lowland grassland, marsh/fen, native pinewood/juniper scrub, rock outcrops, and upland grassland.
  - Where appropriate, guidance includes notes on typical species, distribution, and field considerations.

- Domin Scale details (data recording standard)
  - Domin scale used for % cover (1–10) with explicit ranges for each score (e.g., 1 for very small or single individuals, up to 10 for nearly full coverage).
  - Clear guidance for translating 1x1 m units into percentage cover for both 5x5 m square plots and 10x10 m plots.
  - Abundance scoring aligns with the presence and extent of each species within the plot.
