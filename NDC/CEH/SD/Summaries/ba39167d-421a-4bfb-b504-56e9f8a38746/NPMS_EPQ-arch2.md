# Background

- Purpose and compliance
  - Establishes a standard to assess NPMS quality as a source of scientific advice and evidence fit for purpose.
  - Aligns with The Government Chief Scientific Adviser's Guidelines (2010), The Defra Joint Code of Practice for Research (2012), and JNCC EQA Guidance.
  - Evidence encompasses expert opinion, data, methodologies, results, interpretations, and meta-analyses.

- Quality assurance concepts
  - QA covers processes ensuring work meets quality standards; monitoring and auditing are key.
  - Core QA principles: Fit for purpose (suitability for purpose) and Right first time (eliminate mistakes).

- Objectives of the NPMS
  - Detect change in quality of priority habitats.
  - Understand why change occurs (pressures and drivers).
  - Contribute data for UK Biodiversity Indicator C7 Plants of the wider countryside by measuring plant community change across habitats.

- EQA application to NPMS
  - Supportive publications and materials include:
    - Published peer-reviewed articles (e.g., ecological monitoring with citizen science; NPMS-related work).
    - Papers in preparation (models for interval-censored plant cover data; design of a new UK plant monitoring scheme).
    - Other published articles (press coverage and NPMS introductions).
    - Internal and external reports detailing design and development work (2010–2015).
  - In the context of NPMS objectives, responses to key questions address design, review, uncertainty, bias, and documentation.

- Main elements and design decisions (Q1)
  - Sample stratification and survey design: regular grid plots with random positioning relative to landscape; workshop-informed design; tested via data analysis and field trials.
  - Habitat definitions: developed through peer review with habitat experts.
  - Target species list: objective selection method; reviewed by project team to avoid bias and support volunteer engagement.
  - Field recording: volunteer-based with three contribution levels; guidance and training provided; formal QA of field recording not currently in place but planned.
  - Data input and verification: online capture with a spatially structured database; use of a species dictionary, date/calendar entry, map-based locations, and controlled terms; automated geographic checks; botanical expert verification for exceptions.
  - Data publishing: plan for public availability to enable independent review.
  - Analysis: conducted by experienced quantitative ecologists using R.
  - Reporting: produced by a project team with botany, statistics, and communications expertise; dissemination via NPMS newsletter and peer-reviewed journals.

- Governance and quality assurance oversight (Q2)
  - Project Steering Group oversees NPMS work; external peer review employed when risk warrants (e.g., survey design workshop).

- Communicating uncertainty and limitations (Q3)
  - Outputs reviewed by scientists to ensure claims are evidence-supported.
  - NPMS engagement with CEH’s Monitoring science area provides ongoing critique and scrutiny.

- Avoiding biases (Q4)
  - Robust statistical design enables uncertainty estimation through modeling.

- Documentation, tracking, and version control (Q5)
  - Design work fully reported; versions archived and backed up off-site per a CEH Data Management Plan.
  - PRINCE2 project management standard followed by project managers.
