# 1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

- The National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) collects statistically robust data on plant distribution and habitat condition to understand how wild plants and their habitats are changing, and to provide evidence to UK and national governments. Volunteers receive annual feedback on survey results.  
- NPMS is a partnership run by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI), Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and Plantlife.

## 1.1 How does the survey work?

- The survey monitors abundance of sets of species within fixed plots across 28 fine NPMS habitats, which can be grouped into 11 broad NPMS categories.  
- Up to 30 target species per habitat are recorded, selected as indicators of habitat quality (positive or negative). Data collection is designed to be statistically robust to detect changes in UK plant communities. Species lists are provided in the NPMS Species Lists booklet.

## 1.2 What are the survey structures and targets?

- Minimum survey: 5 plots in different NPMS habitats per kilometre square.  
- Plot types: 3 square plots (5x5 m each) and 2 linear plots (1x25 m each) per kilometre square, though the exact mix can vary. Most plots are 5x5 m; woodland plots are 10x10 m. Each plot should be located in a single habitat. Where possible, survey an accessible pond/flush within the square.  
- Pre-selected plot locations are provided on the map; however, if not suitable, alternatives are allowed (Protocol A).  
- If a habitat changes over time or a plot falls outside NPMS habitat definitions, continue surveying with the relevant NPMS species list as long as possible.

## 1.3 When should I survey?

- Surveys occur twice per year: once in late spring/early summer and once in late summer. In the first year, a reconnaissance visit may help locate plots.

## 1.4 What am I being provided with?

- A allocated kilometre square and a map of that square (indicating NPMS habitats where possible). Map notes cover potential shading inaccuracies and unshaded habitats.  
- A field with pre-selected plot locations, gridlines, and up to 25 pre-selected plot locations.  
- A species guide with visuals and descriptions, an NPMS Species List for habitats, monitoring forms, and access to the NPMS website for additional support and data entry.

## 1.5 What if the species on the list are not present in my plot?

- The number of recorded species depends on habitat quality; recording fewer species can still be meaningful, including indicating habitat decline. There is an online facility to record additional species of interest, which supports broader-scale analyses but does not feed into habitat-quality metrics.

## 1.6 What if my habitat changes over time?

- At first survey, assign a habitat type using the guidance; if the habitat changes (e.g., due to management or environmental shifts), use the appropriate species list at the time of the survey. If a plot becomes a habitat outside the scheme, continue surveying with the NPMS species list for as long as possible to document changes.

## 1.7 What if I cannot do the survey in a year or wish to withdraw?

- You may withdraw by informing NPMS; every effort will be made to reallocate plots to others.

## 1.8 What if I am surveying multiple squares?

- If surveying multiple squares and cannot visit all annually, you can survey squares in alternating years. No surveyor will be allocated more than 5 squares; the maximum interval between visits to any square is five years. Minimum frequencies: every year, every other year, every third year, every fourth year, or every fifth year.

## 2.0 SURVEY LEVELS AND PLOT SELECTION

### 2.1 What are the survey levels?

- Wildflower Level: record a smaller subset of species (subset of Indicator Level).  
- Indicator Level: record all indicator species; robust data.  
- Inventory Level: as Indicator Level plus recording all other vascular plants present within each plot.

### 2.2 How do I select square plots?

- Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands). Preferably locate in pre-selected locations within NPMS habitats; aim for 3 plots in different fine habitats. If suitable pre-selected plots are unavailable, use Protocol A to self-select plots in representative areas of the habitat. Ensure plots can be relocated in future years by marking them on the map and noting permanent features. Accessibility and safety considerations may override plot placement.

### 2.3 How do I select linear plots?

- Linear plots: 1x25 m, used for arable field margins, standing/running waters, rock outcrops, screes, road verges, hedgerows. Start at intersections with gridlines and extend along the feature. Include ponds/flushes as linear plots even if they don’t intersect gridlines. Visit at least 2 accessible linear plots per square; if fewer are available, use Protocol A for self-selected linear plots.

### 2.4 How do I select ponds and flushes?

- Ponds/flushes are surveyed as linear plots if present; survey closest to the centre if multiple are accessible. If only one pond/flush, survey that feature if accessible.

### 2.5 How do I lay out plots?

- Equipment: tape/cords with 5 m marks, corner markers, NPMS forms, clipboard, GPS/compass, camera, pencil.  
- Square plots: position with a favorable relocation anchor (e.g., wall, fence), record SW corner if using GPS, photograph the plot with surroundings, and sketch the plot with orientation.  
- Linear plots: mark 1 m width and extend 25 m; photograph surroundings; sketch. For rock outcrops and screes, use a vertical 2 m high by 12.5 m long plot along the base and up the face, recording within 1 m of either side of the route.  
- Aerial photos and map features help identify suitable plots; self-selected plots should represent typical habitat areas and avoid disturbances unless typical of the habitat.

## 2.3 (continued) Plot specifics and re-finding

- Protocol A (self-selecting plots) should reflect average habitat conditions and be relocatable; mark on the map.

## 3.0 HOW TO RECORD IN YOUR PLOTS

- Use the relevant habitat species list to record species present. For square plots, search intensively from a corner and expand; for linear plots, start at the beginning and move along to capture all species. Inventory Level follows a similar approach without a fixed target list.

- Abundance: estimate percent cover for each species within the plot using the Domin scale (detailed on the back). Include leaves and layers (not just flowers).

- Additional percentage metrics: record bare ground, bare rock/gravel, litter, and moss/lichen coverage.

- Optional extra information per plot (encouraged):  
  - Vegetation height in defined classes with score ranges.  
  - Woodedness (density of trees/shrubs).  
  - Optional: aspect, slope, management practices (with examples in Table 4).  
  - Optional grazing intensity (Table 5).

- Recording is done on NPMS survey forms; forms can be downloaded from the NPMS website. Each plot requires a form; one form can be used for both visits if feasible.

- Data submission: enter data online at www.npms.org.uk (registration required); if online entry is not possible, mail the forms to the NPMS Volunteer Coordinator.

## 4.0 SURVEY FORMS

- Use the provided survey forms to standardize data entry; forms are included and downloadable from the NPMS website. Use one form per plot, reusable for two visits if applicable. Include precise plot location information (grid reference or GPS coordinates).

## 5.0 ACCESS RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

- Surveyors should respect countryside users, protect the environment, and act responsibly. Access rights differ by country within the UK; follow the respective codes (England/Wales: Countryside Code; Scotland: Outdoor Access Code; Northern Ireland: guidance by NI Environment Agency). NPMS provides an introduction letter for landowners if needed.

## 6.0 HEALTH AND SAFETY

- Surveyors are responsible for their own safety. Check weather forecast, avoid unsafe plots (steep slopes, cliffs, tidal areas, etc.), and consider a buddy system. Carry a mobile phone (signal may be limited), a first-aid kit, suitable clothing/footwear, and inform someone of plans and return times.

### Appendix 1: Habitat types

- Describes 28 fine NPMS habitats forming 11 broad categories (used to select the appropriate species list). Examples include arable field margins, bog and wet heath, broadleaved woodland, coast, freshwater habitats, heathland, lowland grasslands, marsh and fen, native pinewood and juniper scrub, rock outcrops, and upland grasslands. The appendix provides context for habitat classification and species lists to be used in field surveys.

Domin Scale

- The document references the Domin scale for percent cover and presence/abundance, outlining value ranges from minimal to high coverage, with guidance on translating plot area percentages to scoring. It provides unit conversions to relate 1% areas to plot dimensions (e.g., 1% of a 5x5 m plot corresponds to 50 cm x 50 cm).

- For a 10x10 m square plot, a 1x1 m square equates to 1% cover; guidance on scoring single individuals versus clumps is provided to standardize abundance assessments.
