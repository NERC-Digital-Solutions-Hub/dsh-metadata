# 1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

- Purpose of NPMS
  - Citizens-nature survey funded by a partnership (BSBI, CEH, JNCC, Plantlife)
  - Aims to map where wild plants grow, monitor habitat condition, and provide evidence on the state of the natural environment
  - Provides participants with annual feedback on survey results

- What the survey measures
  - Abundance of plant sets within fixed plots across 28 fine NPMS habitats (11 broad categories)
  - Species chosen as habitat indicators (positive and negative) to monitor habitat quality over time
  - Data collected to be statistically robust for detecting changes in UK plant communities

- Data and accessibility for data leaders
  - Data designed for long-term trend detection and annual reporting
  - Data, maps, species guides, and forms are provided to support consistent data collection and future reuse
  - Online data entry is encouraged to contribute to national records; offline submission also possible

- Structure of habitats and species lists
  - 28 fine NPMS habitats grouped into 11 broad categories
  - Participants should identify the fine habitat when possible; if unclear, use the broad category list
  - Species lists are habitat- and plot-specific, with guidance on when to use broad versus fine lists

- Roles and collaboration
  - The scheme is collaborative and supports the wider data community
  - Emphasizes data quality, metadata, discoverability, updates, and user-focused product development

- How data will be used
  - Contributes to annual state-of-habitat reporting and long-term environmental assessment
  - Results help governments and organizations monitor changes in habitats and plant communities

- Data quality and standards (implications for data leaders)
  - Emphasis on selecting appropriate habitat lists, consistent plot placement, and repeatable relocation
  - Use of standardized recording methods and Domin scale for percent cover
  - Collection of auxiliary information (vegetation height, woodedness, aspect, slope, management, grazing) to aid interpretation

- Participant support and governance
  - Access to NPMS website for forms, FAQs, support, and additional resources
  - Clear guidance on safety, access rights, and responsibilities across the UK
  - Commitment to supporting participants with relocation aids (sketches, photos, GPS, landmarks)

- Summary of data lifecycle
  - Data collection in the field (plots, species, abundance, habitat changes)
  - Data submission online or via post
  - Ongoing feedback and annual reporting
  - Potential for data to be used in broader-scale analyses beyond immediate habitat assessments
