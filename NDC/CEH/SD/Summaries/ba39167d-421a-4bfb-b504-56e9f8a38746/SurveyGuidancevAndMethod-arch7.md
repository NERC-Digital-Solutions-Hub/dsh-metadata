# National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) Guidance Notes

- Purpose and scope
  - NPMS is a nationwide survey to monitor wild plant distribution and habitat condition in 28 fine NPMS habitats (combine into 11 broad categories).
  - Uses statistically robust data from fixed plots to detect changes over time and provide evidence for national/environmental state reporting; aims to provide annual feedback to volunteers.

- How the survey works
  - For each fine NPMS habitat, up to 30 species are recorded (level depends on participant choice); species lists are provided in the NPMS Species Lists booklet.
  - Plot design and sampling
    - Per kilometre square: aim for a minimum of 5 plots in different NPMS habitats; typical layout is 3 square plots (5x5 m) and 2 linear plots (1x25 m), though composition can vary.
    - Woodland plots are 10x10 m; others are 5x5 m.
    - Prefer to locate plots in different NPMS habitats within the square; each plot must be within a single habitat.
    - If accessible pre-selected plot locations are insufficient, use Protocol A (self-selected plots) within representative NPMS habitats or include ponds/flushes where appropriate.
  - Plot selection and placement
    - Plot locations should be identifiable and relocatable in future years using sketches, GPS, fixed features, and photographs.
    - Pre-selected plot locations may be used when they align with NPMS habitat; safety, access, and habitat mismatch considerations may override.
  - Linear plots and ponds
    - Linear plots (1x25 m) sample arable field margins, standing/running waters, rock outcrops, screes, road verges, and hedgerows; ponds/flushes can be surveyed as linear plots if accessible.
  - Special habitats and layout
    - Detailed guidance provided for vertical plots (rock outcrops, screes) and for survey in diverse habitat types (e.g., arable margins, hedgerows, standing waters).

- Survey levels (data robustness)
  - Wildflower Level: recording a subset of species.
  - Indicator Level: recording all indicator species for habitat assessment.
  - Inventory Level: Indicator Level plus recording all other vascular plants in the plot.

- Data recording and field methods
  - Record species presence using habitat-specific NPMS species lists.
  - Abundance assessment: estimate percent cover for each species (Domin scale 1-10, with guidelines linking percent cover to scale values).
  - Additional cover assessments: bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen.
  - Optional data to capture (strongly encouraged when possible): vegetation height classes, woodedness, aspect, slope, and management indicators (see Tables 4-5 for management and grazing descriptors).
  - Plot-specific protocols for arable margins, road verges, hedgerows, standing waters, springs/flushes, and other habitats are provided to ensure consistent data capture.

- Recording tools and submission
  - Use the provided NPMS survey forms; one form per plot, usable for both visits if both surveys are completed.
  - Data submission preferred online at www.npms.org.uk (registration required); alternatives include posting forms to the NPMS Volunteer Coordinator if online submission is not possible.
  - Supporting materials: field sketches, up to two photographs per plot (with location/direction notes), and GPS grid references to aid relocation.

- Access, rights, and safety
  - Surveyors must respect countryside access rights, landowner permissions, and safety considerations; access varies by country within the UK.
  - NPMS provides a letter to introduce surveyors to landowners; no access arrangements are made by NPMS.
  - Health and safety guidance: assess weather, avoid unsafe plots (e.g., steep slopes, cliffs, tides, active hazards), survey with a buddy when possible, carry a mobile phone and first-aid kit, and wear appropriate clothing.

- Appendix 1: Habitat types
  - Provides detailed descriptions of the 28 fine NPMS habitats and the 11 broad categories (to guide habitat identification and species list selection).
  - Includes guidance on when to use broad category lists vs. fine habitat lists.

- Domin scale and data interpretation
  - The Domin scale translates percent cover into discrete scores (1–10) for each species; explicit guidance is provided for interpreting small vs. large occurrences (e.g., one individual vs. clumps) and for converting area percentages to scale values.
  - Clear examples are provided to ensure consistent scoring across plots and years.

- What to do with the data
  - Enter data online when possible to support annual habitat-state reporting and long-term analyses; offline submission via post is available if needed.
