# Background

- Purpose: Establish a standard to assess the quality of the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) as a source of scientific advice and evidence fit for purpose; aligns with Government Chief Scientific Adviser guidelines (2010), Defra Joint Code of Practice for Research (2012), and JNCC EQA guidance.
- Definition of evidence: Encompasses expert opinion or advice, data, methodology, results from data analysis, interpretation of analyses, and meta-analyses.
- Quality assurance (QA): Defines processes to ensure work meets quality standards; emphasizes monitoring and auditing; core QA principles are “Fit for purpose” and “Right first time.”
- NPMS objectives:
  - Detect change in the quality of priority habitats.
  - Understand why change is occurring (pressures and drivers).
  - Contribute data for the UK Biodiversity Indicator C7 (Plants of the wider countryside) by measuring plant-community change across important habitats.
- Application of EQA to NPMS: Supported by a range of publications and internal/external outputs to ensure quality assurance across design, data handling, analysis, and reporting.

## Supporting publications and outputs

- Published peer-reviewed articles:
  - Pescott et al. 2015: Ecological monitoring with citizen science; design and implementation of schemes for recording plants in Britain and Ireland (Biological Journal of the Linnean Society).
- Peer-review articles in preparation:
  - A comparison of models for interval-censored plant cover data (Pescott et al., in prep).
  - The design of a new plant monitoring scheme for the United Kingdom (Walker et al., in prep).
- Other published articles:
  - Walker et al. 2015: Making plants count (British Wildlife).
  - Pescott et al. 2015: The new National Plant Monitoring Scheme in 2015 (BSBI News).
  - Pescott et al. 2015: The new NPMS (BSS News).
- Reports (2010–2015): Designs and development work for NPMS, including JNCC internal reports and CEH/BSBI/Plantlife collaboration documents.
- Contextual QA questions (Q1–Q5) addressed to ensure robust QA throughout NPMS processes (sample design, habitat definitions, species indicators, field recording, data input/verification, data publishing, analysis, reporting).

## Q1: How partners peer-reviewed methods and publications?

- Sample stratification and survey design developed via a statistical/botanical expert workshop.
- Habitat definitions developed through peer review with habitat experts.
- Target species list created by an objective method, reviewed by the project team for suitability and engagement.
- Field recording designed for volunteer participation with three contribution levels and comprehensive guidance/training.
- Data input/verification: online data capture with a spatial database; species dictionary; date/calendar entry; location mapping; controlled terms; automated range checks; expert verification of exceptions (via BSBI-affiliated botanists).
- Data publishing: data will be publicly available for independent review.
- Analysis and reporting: conducted by experienced quantitative ecologists and a project team with botany, statistics, and science communication expertise; dissemination via NPMS newsletters and peer-reviewed publications.

## Q2: How is appropriate QA level chosen given risk?

- Oversight by a project Steering Group.
- External peer review employed when risk is significant (e.g., survey design workshops).

## Q3: How are uncertainty, quality, assumptions, and limitations communicated?

- Outputs (newsletters, reports) reviewed by scientists to ensure claims are evidence-based.
- NPMS results exposed to broader ecologist scrutiny within CEH’s Monitoring science to solicit constructive critique.

## Q4: How are biases avoided in outputs (e.g., statistics)?

- Robust statistical design enables uncertainty to be estimated through models applied to the data.

## Q5: Document tracking and version control?

- Design work documented; report versions archived and backed up off-site per a CEH Data Management Plan.
- PRINCE2 project management standard followed by project managers.
