# 1.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION

- The National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) is a partnership project (BSBI, CEH, JNCC, Plantlife) designed to collect statistically robust data on wild plants, their habitats, and habitat condition to inform government and annual reporting.
- Volunteers receive annual feedback and guidance to monitor plant communities in 28 fine NPMS habitats (grouped into 11 broad categories) using indicator plants to assess habitat quality over time.

## How the NPMS survey works

- Survey focuses on abundance of sets of species within fixed plots (square and linear) across 28 fine habitats (and 11 broad categories).
- Up to 30 species may be recorded per habitat level; species lists are provided for accurate habitat-specific recording.
- Standardized approach supports robust detection of changes in UK plant communities; species lists available in the NPMS Species Lists booklet.

## Survey design, habitats and levels

- 28 fine NPMS habitats (4 main broad categories include Arable margins, Broadleaved woodland, Fresh water, etc.), with clear guidelines on which species lists to use depending on the fine habitat or broad category.
- Three survey levels:
  - Wildflower Level: fewer species recorded (subset of Indicator Level).
  - Indicator Level: full set of indicator species for habitat assessment (recommended for robust data).
  - Inventory Level: Indicator Level plus recording all other vascular plants present.
- Plots:
  - Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands).
  - Linear plots: 1x25 m, used for arable margins, water bodies, hedgerows, road verges, etc.
  - Each plot should ideally be in a single NPMS habitat; aim to place three plots in different fine habitats per square.
  - In some cases, self-selected plots (Protocol A) are allowed when pre-selected plots are unsuitable.

## Data submission and ongoing data management

- Data should be entered online at www.npms.org.uk to support annual habitat reporting and long-term analyses.
- If online entry is not possible, recording forms can be posted to the NPMS Volunteer Coordinator.
- Data management emphasizes plot relocation for long-term monitoring, with guidelines to photograph plots, sketch layouts, and record GPS/grid references.

## Plot location, layout and relocation

- Pre-selected plot locations are provided on maps; plots should be placed to match NPMS habitats and be relocatable in future years.
- Protocol A allows self-selected plots in representative areas of a habitat, avoiding overly rich or disturbed areas to ensure representative sampling.
- For linear plots, start at the feature’s intersection with a gridline and follow the feature; ponds and flushes are included as linear plots.
- Documentation to aid relocation includes a field sketch, compass direction, notes on permanent features, and up to two photos per plot.

## Specific plot types and layout guidance

- Square plots: standard 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands); relocation features such as walls or fences recommended; use measurements and GPS when available.
- Linear plots: 1x25 m; may follow curved features; start from gridline intersections; include two markers and a 25 m measuring length.
- Special habitats:
  - Ponds/flushes: surveyed as linear or square plots, with care to survey only accessible margins from the bank.
  - Arable field margins: extend 1 m into cultivated area from field edge; exclude perennial crops.
  - Road verges and hedgerows: survey 25x1 m plots where feasible; adjustments if hedge width prevents full 1 m offset.
  - Standing and running waters: survey along banks, extending 25 m with 1 m out from water edge; avoid deep water and fluctuating water bodies.
  - Springs and flushes: ensure ≥50% NPMS habitat within a plot when sampling small patches; record target species within the flush area.

## Recording and data collection in plots

- Record species present using the relevant NPMS species list; square plots are surveyed intensively from a corner outward to cover the whole area.
- Abundance is recorded as percent cover for each species; areas may have multi-layered vegetation requiring careful observation of understory.
- Additional data (optional but recommended):
  - Vegetation height classes (<10 cm to >300 cm) with a 1–3 score based on area coverage.
  - Woodedness: dense trees/shrubs, hedgerow, scattered trees/shrubs, or none.
  - Optional attributes: Aspect, Slope, and Management (e.g., grazing, mowing, hedge cutting) with guidance on how to describe intensity.
  - Grazing level categories (High, Moderate, Low) with descriptive criteria.
- Domin Scale is used for percent cover or abundance, with a defined scale from 1 to 10 (and associated interpretation for rare to widespread cover).
- Recording forms: one form per plot; forms can be reused for both visits if both surveys are completed in the same year; emphasize plotting location data (grid reference or GPS).

## Access rights, safety and responsibilities

- Volunteers should respect countryside access rules across the UK and obtain permission where required.
- Follow local codes (England/Wales: Countryside Code; Scotland: Outdoor Access Code; Northern Ireland guidance).
- NPMS provides a landowner introduction letter; volunteers must manage safe access and personal safety, including weather checks and buddy systems as needed.

## Health and safety

- Volunteers are responsible for their own safety; avoid dangerous areas (steep slopes, cliff edges, unstable ground, tidal areas).
- Plan for weather, carry a first-aid kit, wear appropriate clothing, and consider notifying someone of plans and expected return time.

## Appendix 1: Habitat types and classification

- Habitat types: 28 fine NPMS habitats organized into 11 broad categories (e.g., Arable margins, Bog and wet heath, Broadleaved woodland, Coast, Fresh water, Heathland, Lowland grassland, Marsh and fen, Native pinewood, Rock outcrops, Upland grassland).
- Use the fine habitat classification to select the correct NPMS species list whenever possible; if uncertain, use the broad category with its associated species list.
- The document provides detailed habitat descriptions to guide site classification and species selection.

## Domin Scale and data interpretation

- The Domin Scale provides percent cover categories and counts of individuals for abundance data.
- Clear guidelines link plot area size to percentage points (e.g., 1% cover equals a 50x50 cm area in a 5x5 m plot).
- The scale guides consistent recording of species abundance across plots and years.

## Data submission and support

- Online data entry is encouraged for efficiency; registration is required if not already done.
- Support contact: support@npms.org.uk; alternative option to post forms to NPMS Volunteer Coordinator at Plantlife, Salisbury.

## Quick reference for planners

- Minimums: at least 5 plots per allocated square; aim for 3 square plots and 2 linear plots per square.
- Plot types: mostly 5x5 m squares (10x10 m in woodland); 1x25 m lines; additional vertical plots for rock faces when necessary.
- Survey timing: two visits per year (late spring/early summer and late summer); initial reconnaissance in Year 1 if helpful.
- Data handling: online entry best; offline submission possible; keep relocation features and documentation for longitudinal analyses.
