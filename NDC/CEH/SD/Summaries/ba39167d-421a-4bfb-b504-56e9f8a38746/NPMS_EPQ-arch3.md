# Quality Assurance of the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS)

- Purpose
  - Provide a standard to assess the quality of NPMS as a source of scientific advice and evidence that is fit for purpose.
  - Align with Government Chief Scientific Adviser guidelines, Defra Joint Code of Practice for Research, and JNCC EQA guidance.

- Definitions
  - Evidence: includes expert opinion, data, methodologies, results, interpretations, and meta-analyses.
  - Quality assurance (QA): processes ensuring work meets quality standards; monitoring and auditing are key elements.
  - QA principles: Fit for purpose and Right first time.

- NPMS Objectives
  - Detect change in quality of priority habitats.
  - Understand why change is occurring (pressures and drivers).
  - Contribute data for UK Biodiversity Indicator C7 Plants of the wider countryside by measuring plant community change across key habitats.

- EQA Application to NPMS
  - Supported by a range of publications and internal reports detailing design, implementation, and development of NPMS.
  - Key elements include sample design, habitat definitions, target species indicators, field recording by volunteers, data input/verification, data publishing, analysis, and reporting.

- Design and QA Elements
  - Sample stratification and survey design: developed with statistical and botanical experts; final approach uses a regular grid of plots and gridlines for randomness with respect to landscape.
  - Habitat definitions: peer-reviewed by habitat experts.
  - Target species list: based on objective methods and project team review to ensure unbiased, fit-for-purpose indicators and volunteer engagement.
  - Field recording: volunteer-based with multiple participation levels; guidance and training provided; formal QA of field recording not yet implemented but to be considered.
  - Data input and verification: online, structured spatial database; use of species dictionary, date calendars, location maps, controlled terms; automated geographic range checks; expert verification for exceptions.
  - Data publishing: data will be publicly available for independent review.
  - Analysis: conducted by experienced quantitative ecologists using R.
  - Reporting: produced by a project team with botany, statistics, and communication expertise; disseminated via NPMS newsletter and peer-reviewed publications.

- Governance and Quality Review
  - Oversight by a project Steering Group.
  - External peer review used when risk assessment warrants it (e.g., survey design workshop).
  - Uncertainty, quality, assumptions, and limitations are checked by scientists within the review team; openness to external constructive critique.

- Addressing Bias and Risk
  - Bias mitigation through robust statistical design enabling uncertainty estimation via models.

- Documentation and Data Management
  - All design outputs documented; versioned and archived; off-site backups.
  - Data Management Plan at CEH governs project practices; adherence to PRINCE2 project management standards.

- Communication of Uncertainty and Assumptions
  - Outputs (newsletters, reports) reviewed to ensure claims are evidence-based.
  - Ongoing engagement with the broader Monitoring science community to receive feedback.

- Data Accessibility and Transparency
  - Commitment to public availability of NPMS data to enable independent review.

- Additional Context on Practice and Barriers
  - Volunteer training and varying botanical expertise acknowledged; three levels of contribution to accommodate skill levels.
  - Formal QA of field recording not currently in place, with plans to consider future incorporation.
  - Data transformation and metadata quality are addressed through structured data capture and verification processes; aims to minimize data silos via integrated governance and reporting.
