# Background

## Overview
- Policy standard for assessing NPMS quality as evidence fit for purpose.
- Aligns with Government and Defra guidance; defines evidence and QA concepts.

## Policy context
- Evidence encompasses expert opinion, data, methodologies, results, interpretations, and syntheses.
- QA includes processes to ensure outputs meet quality standards, with monitoring and auditing as core components.
- Core QA principles: “Fit for purpose” and “Right first time.”

## Objectives of the NPMS
- Detect changes in the quality of priority habitats.
- Understand why change is happening (pressures and drivers).
- Contribute data for the UK Biodiversity Indicator C7 (Plants of the wider countryside) by measuring plant community change in key habitats.

## Application of EQA to the NPMS
- Substantive guidance and evidence sources include peer-reviewed articles, in-prep papers, other published articles, and internal/commissioned reports.
- Publications and reports illustrate design, methods, and development history of NPMS.
- Key question areas (Q1–Q5) address governance, design, data handling, uncertainty, and documentation.

### Q1. Partnership review and publications
- Methods and publications developed via expert workshop with statisticians and botanists.
- Habitat definitions, target species list, and survey design refined through peer input, field testing, and volunteer engagement.
- Field recording supported by tiered volunteer participation, training, and guidance.
- Data input/verification uses online capture, a species dictionary, date/location controls, and habitat terms; botanical experts review exceptions.
- Data publishing planned for public access; analyses by experienced ecologists using R; results disseminated via NPMS newsletter and peer-reviewed outlets.

### Q2. Appropriate level of QA and review
- NPMS overseen by a project Steering Group.
- External peer review employed when risk warrants it (e.g., survey-design workshop).

### Q3. Communicating uncertainty, quality, and limitations
- Outputs reviewed by scientists to ensure claims are evidence-based.
- Ongoing external interest from CEH and wider ecological community supports continual feedback and scrutiny.

### Q4. Avoiding biases
- Robust statistical design enables uncertainty to be estimated with models applied to the data.

### Q5. Documentation and version control
- Design work documented; versions archived and backed up off-site per the CEH Data Management Plan.
- PRINCE2 project management standard followed for governance and backups.

## Data, analysis, and outputs
- Field data collected by volunteers with varying botanical expertise; three participation levels to match skills.
- Spatial data captured via online system; data quality aided by automation (range checks) and expert verification.
- Analysis conducted by quantitative ecologists using R; reporting by a multidisciplinary project team (botany, statistics, communication) to researchers, volunteers, policy-makers, and public.
- Data published openly to enable independent review.

## Implications for GIS Specialists
- NPMS relies on map-based data and spatial databases to track habitat change and plant communities.
- Design choices emphasize random, grid-based plot placement with defined linear plot lines, aiding spatial representativeness.
- Data standards (species dictionary, calendar dates, habitat terms) support consistent GIS mapping and cross-dataset integration.
- Quality assurance and version control are integral to trustworthy map products; uncertainty and limitations must be communicated alongside geospatial outputs.
- Public data access enables transparency and external validation of GIS-based results.

## Key takeaways for GIS work
- Emphasize robust spatial data structures and standardized vocabularies to enable reliable map visualisations.
- Incorporate uncertainty estimates into map products and accompanying explanations.
- Align data management with PRINCE2-based governance and a formal data management plan.
- Ensure outputs are openly accessible for independent GIS-based review and reuse.
