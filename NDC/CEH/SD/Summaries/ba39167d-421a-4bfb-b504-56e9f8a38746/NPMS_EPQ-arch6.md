# Background

- Compliance and definitions
  - A standard to assess the quality of the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) as a source of scientific advice and evidence fit for purpose.
  - Aligns with Government Chief Scientific Adviser Guidelines (2010), Defra Joint Code of Practice for Research (2012), and JNCC EQA Guidance.
  - Evidence encompasses expert opinion, data, methods, results, interpretations, and syntheses of scientific information.
  - Quality Assurance (QA) includes monitoring and auditing; core QA principles: “Fit for purpose” and “Right first time.”

- NPMS objectives
  - Detect changes in the quality of priority habitats.
  - Help understand why change is occurring (pressures and drivers).
  - Contribute data for UK Biodiversity Indicator C7 (Plants of the wider countryside) by measuring changes in plant communities across important habitats.

- Application of EQA to NPMS: supporting materials
  - Publications and reports underpinning EQA, including peer-reviewed articles, ongoing works in preparation, and internal/organizational reports.
  - Examples include design and implementation of citizen-science monitoring, and communications about the NPMS.

- Q1: How partnership peer reviews methods and publications
  - NPMS elements developed with expert input: sample stratification and survey design; habitat definitions; target species list; field recording; data input and verification; data publishing; analysis; and reporting.
  - Design features: regular grid plots and linear plot lines; habitat indicators selected to be unbiased and usable by volunteers.
  - Data capture and QA processes: online data capture with structured spatial database; species dictionary; standardized date and location fields; controlled habitat terms and cover scales; automated checks; expert verification for certain records.
  - Field participation: volunteers with multiple expertise levels; training and guidance provided; formal QA of field recording not yet implemented but planned.
  - Analysis and reporting: conducted by quantitative ecologists using R; dissemination via NPMS newsletters and peer-reviewed journals.

- Q2: Level of review/QA and risk management
  - Oversight by a project Steering Group; external peer review conducted as needed based on risk.
  - Example: dedicated workshop with experts to address survey design issues.

- Q3: Communicating uncertainty, quality, assumptions, and limitations
  - Outputs reviewed by scientists to ensure claims are evidence-based; welcomes ongoing feedback from the broader monitoring science community.

- Q4: Avoiding biases
  - Use of robust statistical design to enable uncertainty to be estimated through models applied to the data.

- Q5: Document tracking and version control
  - Design work documented; report versions archived and backed up off-site according to a Data Management Plan.
  - Project management follows PRINCE2 standards.
