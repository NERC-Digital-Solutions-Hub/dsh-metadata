# National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) Background Information

- Purpose: NPMS is a national plant-recording survey across 28 fine NPMS habitats (combined into 11 broad categories) to track where wild plants grow, habitat condition, and to provide evidence of environmental state to UK/national governments. It aims to deliver annual feedback on survey results.
- Organisers: A partnership of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI), Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), and Plantlife.

## How the NPMS works (design, habitats, outputs)

- Plots and habitats:
  - Fixed plots are used to monitor abundance of plant sets.
  - 28 fine NPMS habitats (convertible to 11 broad NPMS categories).
  - Each habitat has up to 30 target species (depends on participation level); species lists are habitat-specific.
- Output and data quality:
  - Data are collected to be statistically robust for detecting change in UK plant communities.
  - Outputs include habitat condition assessments and trends over time.
  - Data are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals; annual reporting is produced.

## Survey execution and levels

- Survey frequency and timing:
  - Visit plots twice per year: late spring/early summer and late summer.
  - In year 1, a reconnaissance visit is recommended to locate plots and learn the square.
- Minimum effort and plot types:
  - Survey a minimum of 5 plots per allocated kilometre square (ideally 3 square plots and 2 linear plots; exact numbers may vary by square).
  - Plot sizes: 5x5 m square plots (10x10 m in woodlands); 1x25 m for linear plots.
  - Prefer locating plots in different NPMS habitats; every plot must be within a single habitat.
  - If accessible ponds or flushes exist, survey them when possible.
- Levels of survey (three options):
  - Wildflower Level: fewer species recorded (subset of Indicator Level).
  - Indicator Level: all indicator species (+ robust data).
  - Inventory Level: Indicator Level plus recording all other vascular plants in the plot.
- Plot placement and selection:
  - Prefer pre-selected plot locations within mapped NPMS habitats.
  - Protocol A allows self-selected plots that are representative of the habitat (avoid extremes of high richness or disturbance).
  - Plots should be relocatable in future years using permanent features and sketches/photos.

## Data collection and entry

- What to record in each plot:
  - Record species present using the habitat-specific NPMS species list.
  - Estimate abundance as percent cover for each species (Domin scale).
  - Record bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen covers.
  - Optional but encouraged: vegetation height classes, woodedness, aspect, slope, and management signs (e.g., grazing, mowing, hedgelaying, etc.).
  - Optional grazing intensity categories and management details (Tables 4 and 5 describe management and grazing levels).
- How to record and align with the Domin Scale:
  - Use Domin scale values (1-10) to represent percent cover; examples provided:
    - If only one individual of a species is present, score 1.
    - A few individuals not filling a 50x50 cm square score 2.
    - A large clump covering more than one but up to four 50x50 cm squares scores 3.
    - Guidelines help translate observations into a consistent 1–10 scale.
  - For a 10x10 m plot, 1% cover equals 1x1 m area; for a 5x5 m plot, scoring is based on 50x50 cm units and distribution.
- Recording forms and data entry:
  - Use NPMS-provided survey forms; one form per plot (usable for both visits).
  - Enter data online at www.npms.org.uk (registration required); paper forms can be mailed if online entry is not possible.
  - Uploads of sketches, photographs (max 2 per plot), and GPS coordinates help future relocation and interpretation.
- Additional considerations:
  - If target species are largely absent, capturing additional non-target species online can still support broad-scale analyses (not feeding into habitat-quality indicators).
  - If habitats change over time, use the appropriate species list for the current habitat during each survey.

## Access, safety, and responsibilities

- Access and rights:
  - Respect countryside users and the environment; follow local access codes (England/Wales: Countryside Code; Scotland: Scottish Outdoor Access Code; Northern Ireland: NI Environment Agency guidance).
  - In England/Wales, enter private land only with permission; the NPMS provides an introductory letter for landowners.
- Health and safety:
  - Volunteers are responsible for their own safety; assess weather and site conditions; avoid dangerous areas (steep slopes, cliffs, tides, etc.).
  - Consider working with a buddy; carry a mobile phone, first-aid kit, suitable clothing, and footwear.
- Data and governance:
  - Data are stored and shared via NPMS portals; support is available for online entry (support@npms.org.uk).

## Additional note on the recording framework (summary for analysts)

- The NPMS provides a standardised, repeatable framework to assess habitat condition through time using habitat- and species-specific lists, consistent abundance scoring (Domin scale), and a mix of fixed and flexible plotting methods to accommodate site safety and accessibility.
- The data structure supports cross-site comparisons, trend analyses, and integration with other environmental data, aligning with the goal of turning monitoring into actionable environmental insight.
- A focus on data accessibility addresses the challenge of enabling broader access to underlying data while maintaining standardized outputs for policy performance reviews.
