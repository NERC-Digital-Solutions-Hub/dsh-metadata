# Background

- This policy sets a standard to assess the quality of the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) as a source of scientific advice and evidence fit for policy use.
- It aligns with government and Defra guidance on scientific advice, research practice, and quality assurance.
- Evidence encompasses expert opinion, data, methodologies, results, interpretations, and syntheses of scientific information.
- Quality Assurance (QA) covers processes to ensure work meets quality standards, with monitoring and auditing as core components; key QA principles are “fit for purpose” and “right first time.”

## Objectives of the NPMS

- Detect changes in the quality of priority habitats.
- Understand why changes are occurring (pressures and drivers).
- Contribute data for the UK Biodiversity Indicator C7 (Plants of the wider countryside) by measuring plant community changes across important habitats.

## Application of EQA to the NPMS

- Publications and sources supporting EQA include peer-reviewed articles, in-preparation studies, other public articles, and formal reports.
- Key design elements and QA considerations:
  - Sample stratification and survey design developed with statistical and botanical experts; use of a regular grid of plots and linear plot gridlines chosen for random sampling relative to landscape.
  - Habitat definitions developed via peer review with habitat experts.
  - Target species list created with objective methods; reviewed by the project team for suitability, balance, and engagement potential.
  - Field recording by volunteers with three participation levels; training and guidance provided; formal QA of field recording is under consideration for future years.
  - Data input and verification: online data capture with a spatial database, a species dictionary, date calendars, controlled terms, and geographic range checks; botanical expert verification for higher-skill records.
  - Data publishing: data will be publicly available to enable independent review.
  - Analysis: conducted by experienced quantitative ecologists using R scripts.
  - Reporting: prepared by a team with botany, statistics, and communication expertise; results disseminated via NPMS newsletters and peer-reviewed publications.

## Governance, oversight, and review

- The NPMS is overseen by a project Steering Group.
- External peer review is employed where necessary based on risk; complex design issues have involved expert workshops.
- Outputs are checked by scientists to ensure claims are evidence-supported; ongoing feedback from external ecologists within CEH is anticipated.
- Bias minimization is achieved through robust statistical design allowing uncertainty to be estimated by models.

## Documentation, version control, and data management

- All design work and outputs are version-controlled; report versions are archived and backed up off-site per a CEH Data Management Plan.
- Project management follows PRINCE2 standards, ensuring traceability and proper documentation across design, data handling, and reporting.

## Uncertainty, limitations, and communication

- Outputs (newsletters, reports) are reviewed to ensure claims reflect evidence; uncertainty and limitations are clearly communicated.
- The design facilitates uncertainty estimation and transparent reporting of limitations and assumptions.

## Data availability and sharing

- Aims to publish NPMS data publicly to enable independent review of results and promote transparency in evidence used for policy and research.
