# National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) Volunteer Guidance

- Aims: Collect robust, nationally comparable data on plant distribution and habitat condition to assess changes over time and inform government and policy decisions; provide volunteers with annual feedback.
- Partners: Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI), Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), Plantlife.

## What the survey measures and why it matters
- Monitors abundance of selected plant species within fixed plots across 28 fine NPMS habitats (11 broad categories).
- Uses indicator species to assess habitat quality and detect change over time.
- Data enable annual reporting on habitat state and plant community changes; information feeds into policy and environmental assessments.

## Survey design and habitat structure
- 28 fine NPMS habitats grouped into 11 broad categories; where possible, identify the fine habitat to use the corresponding species list.
- Species lists are chosen for ease of identification, habitat relevance, and broad distribution.
- Scope includes a wide range of habitats (e.g., arable margins, bogs, woodlands, heathlands, grasslands, wetlands, coasts, freshwater, etc.).

## Survey levels
- Wildflower Level: recording a subset of species.
- Indicator Level: full set of indicator species for robust habitat assessment.
- Inventory Level: Indicator Level plus recording all other vascular plants in each plot.
- Progression through levels is encouraged to build data quality and comparability.

## Plot types and placement
- Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands); aim to place plots within a single NPMS habitat.
- Linear plots: 1x25 m; used for habitats such as arable margins, rivers/streams, hedgerows, roadsides, and similar features.
- Ponds and flushes: treated as linear plots when surveyed; place where accessible if present.
- Pre-selected plot locations: map-based guidance to help fieldwork; but you may self-select plots (Protocol A) when necessary.
- Minimum requirements: survey at least 5 plots per kilometre square, with a recommended mix of 3 square plots and 2 linear plots (adjustable by site).

## Plot selection and relocation
- Protocol A (self-selecting plots): choose representative areas within the habitat, avoid obvious disturbance, mark plots on map to aid relocation.
- Ensure plots can be relocated in future years (use permanent features, sketches, compass directions, photographs).

## How to record in plots (method)
- Record species present using the habitat-specific NPMS species list.
- Abundance: assess percent cover for each species (Domin scale explained in accompanying materials).
- Additional components to record per plot: bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, moss/lichen (percent cover or presence as per Domin scale).
- Optional but recommended: vegetation height classes, woodedness, slope, aspect, and management indicators (e.g., grazing, mowing, hedge cutting).
- For arable margins and hedgerows, apply specific plotting positions relative to field edges and hedge centers as described.
- For standing/w etc., record from the bank; for rivers/streams, account for margins and emergent vegetation.
- For small or irregular habitats (springs/flushes), maximize the NPMS habitat proportion within the plot.

## Data collection tools and documentation
- Equipment: measuring tools, corner markers, NPMS forms, identification guides, clipboard, GPS, compass, camera, pencils.
- Field sketches and photos: include orientation, permanent features, and relocation cues; up to two photos per plot.
- Data entry: online at NPMS website (npms.org.uk). If online entry is not possible, send physical forms by post.
- Each plot requires a dedicated survey form; one form can cover two visits if feasible.

## Data submission and data management
- Primary data entry online to contribute to annual habitat state reporting and longitudinal analyses.
- Data and metadata should be traceable to plots, with relocation aids (sketches, photos, coordinates).
- Support: NPMS help available via support@npms.org.uk; alternative submission by mail if needed.

## Access rights, responsibilities, and safety
- Respect countryside use and land access rights; obtain permission for private land where required.
- Follow local codes of access and land management guidance; use a “buddy system” where possible; carry a mobile phone and first-aid kit; monitor weather and safety risks.
- Avoid survey in dangerous locations (steep slopes, cliff edges, unstable ground); do not compromise safety.

## Appendix 1: Habitat types and classification
- 28 fine NPMS habitats organized into 11 broad categories (e.g., Arable field margins; Bog and wet heath; Broadleaved woodland; Coast; Fresh water; Heathland; Lowland grassland; Marsh and fen; Native pinewood and juniper scrub; Rock outcrops; Upland grassland).
- If a fine habitat is known, use its specific species list; if not, use the relevant broad category list.

## Domin Scale (abundance and coverage)
- Percent cover scale from 1 to 10 (with defined ranges for each increment) to quantify how much plot area is occupied by each species.
- Individual counts and cover are translated into Domin scores to standardize abundance across plots.
- Guidance for translating observations into percent cover and presence/absence metrics is provided (e.g., 1% cover corresponds to a single unit, larger clumps map to higher scores).

## Practical considerations for analysts
- The design emphasizes statistical robustness and comparability across the UK, enabling detection of change in plant communities.
- Data gaps and accessibility challenges are acknowledged (e.g., data scattered in journals/reports, IT barriers, access to local datasets).
- The NPMS framework seeks to mitigate these issues by standardized plots, online data entry, and metadata-rich records to ensure discoverability and usability of datasets.
