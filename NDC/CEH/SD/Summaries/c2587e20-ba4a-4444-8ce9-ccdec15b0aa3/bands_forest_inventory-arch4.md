# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

- The AFEX project is conducted within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) area, KM41 reserve, about 100 km from Manaus, Brazil. The site features clay-rich Ferrasols, 1900–2500 mm annual rainfall with a pronounced dry season (June–October). Forest structure measurements include an above-ground biomass (AGB) of 322 ± 54 Mg ha-1 (≥10 cm DBH) and mean wood density of 0.67 g cm-3, with around 280 species per hectare (≥10 cm DBH).

## Study area and experimental design

- AFEX started in March 2017 and is a full factorial fertilization experiment with eight treatments, four replicates per treatment (32 plots total) organized into four independent blocks spaced at least 200 m apart.
- Treatments include: Control; Nitrogen (N); Phosphorus (P); Cations; N + P; N + Cations; P + Cations; N + P + Cations.
- Plot size is 50 x 50 meters, with plots at least 50 meters apart, located in areas with similar soil, vegetation, and topography.
- AFEX 2.0 (Plot delineation) involves annual fertilization divided into three applications to reduce nutrient leaching and runoff. Fertilizers are applied manually during systematic walks within plots.

## Data collection and methods

- Forest inventories conducted annually from 2017 to 2019.
  - 2017 inventory took longer due to initial botanical identification; 2018 and 2019 inventories occurred in May.
  - DBH measured at 1.3 m above ground for trees with DBH > 10 cm (some measurements adjusted due to buttresses or deformities).
  - Quality control included staff training and in-field data entry to minimize errors. Recruitment is defined as new individuals reaching DBH > 10 cm; mortality is recorded.
- Growth measurements via dendrometric bands installed on 1,299 trees.
  - Measurements are the circumference distance (mm) between a fixed window on the dendrometer band and its moving end, recorded with a digital caliper.
  - Data collection avoided rain due to instrument sensitivity.
  - 2018 sampling: April, June, July, August, September, October, November.
  - 2019 sampling: January, February, April, July, October.
  - 2020 sampling: January.
- Figures referenced (not shown here) illustrate the caliper measurement setup and plot locations.

## Data spreadsheets and metadata

- Data spreadsheet 1 (Figure 4) contains: TAG (individual ID), Block, Plot, PlotID, DBH_2017, DBH_2018, DBH_2019, OBS (status indicators such as dead, lost, pendant), MH (height), CR (condition flags: alive, buttresses, vine, estimated diameter at breast height, anchor tree, missing), DN (damage types), Family (botanical family), Specie (scientific name), W (corrected species name), Measurement date columns (2017, 2018, 2019).
  - The OBS field tracks statuses like dead or missing trees; DN codes describe damage types; CR and other fields describe tree characteristics.
- Data spreadsheet 2 (Figure 5) covers dendrometric bands data:
  - Block, Plot, PlotID, subp_x, subp_Y, number Family, specie, date_band_install.
  - For each band: multiple rows detail species, family, and installation date, followed by a sequence of window measurements (circumference changes) and corresponding measurement dates.
  - Column mappings include identifiers, family, species, installation date, and a matrix of window/date measurements.
- Data management and accessibility:
  - The forest inventory and dendrometric bands data are deposited in the EIDC system (a data repository), ensuring discoverability and long-term preservation.
