# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

## Study area
- Located within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) area, KM41 reserve, ~100 km from Manaus (02o24'S, 59o52'W).
- Soils are clay-rich Ferralsols, covering about 30% of the Amazon Basin.
- Climate: annual rainfall 1900–2500 mm with a pronounced dry season (June–October).
- Forest structure baselines: above-ground biomass (AGB) 322 ± 54 Mg ha-1 for trees ≥10 cm DBH; mean wood density 0.67 g cm-3; species richness ~280 species per hectare (≥10 cm DBH).

## AFEX design and plot delineation
- AFEX (Amazon Fertilization Experiment) is a full factorial fertilization experiment with eight treatments and four replicates per treatment, totaling 32 plots across four independent blocks.
- Plot configuration: each plot is 50 x 50 meters, with a minimum separation of 50 meters between plots.
- Fertilization regime: annual application of 125 kg ha-1 year-1 N (urea), 50 kg ha-1 year-1 P (Ca(H2PO4)2), 50 kg ha-1 year-1 K (KCl), plus 50 kg ha-1 Ca and 20 kg ha-1 Mg (as dolomitic limestone) to supply cations.
- Treatments include: Control; N; P; cations; N+P; N+cations; P+cations; N+P+cations.
- AFEX 2.0: Plot delineation refinements and ongoing placement of fertilization blocks and plots within KM41.

## Data collection and measurement methods
- Forest inventories conducted annually from 2017 to 2019; 2017 inventory took longer due to botanical identification requirements; 2018–2019 inventories occurred in May.
- DBH measurement: diameter at 1.3 m above ground for trees with DBH > 10 cm; adjustments applied for buttressed/deformed trees.
- Quality control: trained staff and in-field data entry to reduce errors; recruitment of new individuals reaching 10 cm DBH; mortality recorded.
- Growth monitoring: dendrometric bands installed on 1,299 trees to obtain high-frequency growth data via distance changes between band windows; measurements avoided during rain due to humidity sensitivity.
- 2018 measurements occurred in April, June, July, August, September, October, and November; 2019 measurements in January, February, April, July, and October; 2020 in January.
- Calibration and data capture tools: caliper-based window measurements illustrated; field procedures designed to minimize data loss and improve precision.

## Data spreadsheets and data management
- Two main data spreadsheets deposited in the EIDC system:
  - Tree inventory data: fields include Block, Plot, PlotID, DBH_2017, DBH_2018, DBH_2019, status indicators (OBS, MH, CR, DN), family, species, and census dates; includes identifiers for each individual (TAG) and data quality notes (e.g., dead, lost).
  - Dendrometric bands data: fields include Block, Plot, subp_x, subp_Y, family, species, date_band_install; records of taxa with installation dates and window measurements across years.
- Detailed column mappings: extensive metadata describing how each column represents plot, tree, measurement dates, species identity, and band data; notes on measurement conditions and data status.
- Data management practices: field staff training, direct field entry to reduce transcription errors, and explicit data dictionaries to support data reuse and verification.

## Data governance, openness, and limitations
- Data provenance includes explicit plot-block-tree identifiers and measurement dates to support traceability and reproducibility.
- Data are deposited in a formal data system (EIDC), supporting data sharing and governance.
- Data quality considerations noted: metadata gaps can hinder verification; some datasets require transformation for use; public sharing of underlying data can present barriers for certain datasets.
- Regular updates and clear documentation are essential to ensure datasets meet standards for quality, openness, and long-term management.
