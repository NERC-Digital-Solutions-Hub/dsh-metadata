# Fish biomass and density data

## Overview
- Three chalkstream sites in the Wessex chalk area: Nine Mile River, River Till, River Wylye.
- Data collected to quantify standing stocks and to construct quantified food webs; five sampling occasions between October 2012 and October 2013.
- Sites reflect a gradient of landscape integrity.

## Data collected and taxa
- Taxa density estimated from multi-pass electrofishing; mean biomass per m2 of each taxon derived by applying length-mass regressions to density estimates, yielding biomass per m2 per taxon per site per occasion.
- Benthic species poorly captured by electrofishing (e.g., bullheads, stone loach) assessed with a modified Hess sampler (0.12 m2), deployed 20 times per date.

## Sampling design and procedures
- Benthic fish sampling: downstream to upstream along 100 m reach, Hess sampler placed on the riverbed, 30 seconds of agitation to dislodge fish, captured fish identified to species and measured.
- Electrofishing: 100 m reach with stop nets; all fish captured, counted, measured, and weighed; depletion sampling following Zippin (1958).
- If initial runs yield fewer than 50 individuals in the first run and fewer than 100 in total, a second 100 m reach upstream is electrofished with additional depletion runs.

## Location and timing
- Data collected on five occasions across the three sites, between October 2012 and October 2013.
- Sampling timed to avoid the salmonid breeding season (December–March).

## Data management and structure
- Data fields include: RIVER_ID, SITE_ID, RIVER_NAME, SITE_NAME, OS_NGR, OS_EASTING, OS_NORTHING, SURVEY_DATE, REACH, TAXON_NAME, Biomass_mgperm2, Density_Noperm2, 2SD.
- Biomass and density values are computed per taxon, site, and survey date; 2SD denotes the standard deviation around density estimates when calculable.

## Quality assurance and accountability
- Strict adherence to standard protocols for benthic sampling and electrofishing.
- No formal internal QA procedure (e.g., repeat surveys within the same sampling period); electrofishing conducted by highly experienced biologists.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Data collection, processing, analysis, interpretation, and management conducted by the Queen Mary University of London River Communities Group, led by Dr J. Iwan Jones.

## Completeness and limitations
- Five sampling occasions across three sites; decoupled from salmonid breeding season to minimize disturbance.
- Limitations include potential biases in electrofishing efficiency across species and the use of methods for species with low catchability; some data may lack 2SD where data are insufficient.
