# Experimental Design/Sampling Regime

## Aim and scope
- Analytical study to assess the effect of irrigation on the abundance of mosquito species important for Rift Valley fever.
- Sampling conducted inside and outside the irrigation scheme; seasonality expected to influence irrigation effects (more apparent during the dry season).
- Repeated sampling across wet and dry seasons and across active vs inactive irrigation periods; each sampling visit included three consecutive days of trapping to reduce variability.

## Study design
- Locations: within the irrigation scheme across ten villages; control sites include Murukani village (15 km east of irrigated farms) and pastoral areas in Ijara, Garissa.
- Temporal design: covers wet vs dry seasons and irrigation activity statuses (active vs inactive).

## Field work/Collection Methods
- Trapping: CO2-baited CDC light traps set from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm for 3 consecutive days; 10 traps per night in homesteads and surrounding irrigated farms.
- Controls: sampling also conducted in a non-irrigated area (Murukani) and pastoral areas.
- Mosquito handling: collected mosquitoes transported to a field/lab, immobilized with 99.5% triethylamine, preserved in liquid nitrogen for transport to KEMRI for identification.
- Sampling sites: traps placed in livestock night sheds, bushes, houses, farms, and forested areas.
- Sample transfer: initial method transferred mosquitoes from collection bags (CBG) to centrifuge tubes (CNT) and then to Eppendorf tubes (EPF); early surveys transferred directly from CBGs to EPF; CNTs introduced later for field-to-lab transport.
- Georeferencing: all trapping and larval collection sites are georeferenced.

## Laboratory methods and identification
- Species identification: conducted using established keys (Edwards 1941; Gillies & de Meillon 1968; Jupp 1986; Gillies & Coetzee 1987; Harbach 1988).
- Pooling: identified mosquitoes pooled up to 25 per pool.
- Preservation and handling: after identification, pools preserved at -70 °C; processing performed on ice to preserve virus for downstream work.
- Quality control: identifications performed by expert taxonomists; accuracy validated by internationally certified taxonomists prior to pooling and preservation.

## Dataset
- File: DDDAC_Kenya_entomology.csv
- Variables (9): date, latitude, longitude, cbg, cnt, epf, species, sex, Pool_size
- Data details: each variable described; missing data indicated as na; missing latitude/longitude attributed to equipment failure.

## Geospatial and data quality considerations for GIS
- Georeferenced data enable mapping of trap locations, sampling effort, and species distributions.
- Coordinates provided in decimal degrees; dataset structure supports spatial analyses and integration into GIS workflows.
- Clear traceability of samples through CBG/CNT/EPF steps aids data provenance in GIS analyses.
