# Overview

- What: Shapefiles of stream networks, including both natural and artificial watercourses (rivers, streams, canals etc.)
- Where: Mundeni Aru, Maduru Oya and Miyangolla Ela river basins in eastern Sri Lanka
- How: The stream networks were manually mapped using satellite imagery from Google Earth
- Why: For use in hydrologic modelling for the CFLOOD project (Compound flooding from tropical cyclone-induced sea surge and precipitation in Sri Lanka)
- Who: J.B.R Matthews mapped the stream networks; R. Jayaratne and A. Raby provided oversight and advice
- Completeness: Intended to be detailed enough for the hydrologic modelling purpose, but watercourses not visible in Google Earth imagery (e.g., due to dense vegetation) could not be mapped
- Collection/generation/transformation methods:
  - Used the most appropriate historic Google Earth imagery for each location, prioritising higher river levels, more recent images, and higher image quality
  - OpenStreetMap (OSM) used as a starting point; watercourses already in OSM were re-mapped
  - Aimed for completeness; dense vegetation prevented mapping in some areas; some minor canals not mapped
  - Missing watercourses should be accounted for when using the networks for modelling
  - Centrelines were manually traced and snapped together at vertices; line segment order indicates flow direction (downhill); uncertainty in flat areas
  - Breaks occur where lakes are present
  - Widths assigned based on the maximum breadth observed in images; transitions between segments may need smoothing for modelling
- Nature and Units of recorded values:
  - Shapefiles contain centrelines in UTM Zone 44N (EPSG:32644)
  - Width_m attribute provides watercourse width in meters; widths are segmented to capture variation
  - Width values are precise for measurement but should be treated as general indicators for hydrologic modelling
- Quality control:
  - Data integrity checked, including vertex connections and flow-direction ordering
- Details of data structure:
  - Stream networks for each basin are in separate shapefile folders:
    - CFLOOD_MundeniAru_StreamNetwork_utm
    - CFLOOD_MaduruOya_StreamNetwork_utm
    - CFLOOD_MiyangollaEla_StreamNetwork_utm
  - Each shapefile contains a single attribute: Width_m (watercourse width in meters)
