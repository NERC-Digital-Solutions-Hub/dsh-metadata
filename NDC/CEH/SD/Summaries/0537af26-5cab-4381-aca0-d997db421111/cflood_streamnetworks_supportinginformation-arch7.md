# Shapefiles of stream networks for CFLOOD project in Mundeni Aru, Maduru Oya and Miyangolla Ela river basins

- What: Shapefiles of stream networks, including both natural and artificial watercourses (rivers, streams, canals, etc.)
- Where: Mundeni Aru, Maduru Oya, and Miyangolla Ela river basins in eastern Sri Lanka
- How: 
  - Manually mapped from satellite imagery in Google Earth
  - OpenStreetMap (OSM) used as a starting reference; watercourses already in OSM re-mapped
  - Centrelines traced and snapped at vertices using QGIS; flow direction indicated by the order of points
  - Widths assigned from the maximum breadth observed in imagery
  - Some networks may have directional uncertainty in flat areas; breaks occur where lakes exist
- Why: For hydrologic modelling in the CFLOOD project (compound flooding from tropical cyclone-induced sea surge and precipitation)
- Who: Mapped by J.B.R Matthews; oversight and advice from R. Jayaratne and A. Raby
- Completeness and limitations:
  - Aims for detailed mapping suitable for modelling, but dense vegetation blocked some watercourses
  - Some minor canals not mapped; missing watercourses should be accounted for in modelling
  - Watercourses not visible in imagery cannot be mapped
- Data collection and transformation details:
  - Imagery selected based on river level (wider features preferred at high levels), recency, and image quality
  - Some watercourses present in OSM were re-mapped; where gaps exist, users should consider them in modelling
- Data structure and schema:
  - Shapefiles organized into three folders:
    - CFLOOD_MundeniAru_StreamNetwork_utm
    - CFLOOD_MaduruOya_StreamNetwork_utm
    - CFLOOD_MiyangollaEla_StreamNetwork_utm
  - Each shapefile contains a single attribute: Width_m (width in meters)
- Coordinate system and units:
  - UTM Zone 44N (EPSG:32644)
  - Width_m provided in meters; widths are general indications and may vary along a segment
- Quality control:
  - Integrity checks on vertex connections and flow-direction ordering
- Practical notes for use:
  - Widths may require smoothing for hydrologic modelling
  - Direction uncertainty may exist in flat delta regions; verify with ancillary data if precise flow direction is critical
