# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview and purpose
  - A collaborative, funded program by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteers to collect annual site-based butterfly data, spanning multiple monitoring approaches and habitats.
  - Covers over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year; data are used to understand population changes and inform biodiversity policy.
  - Sampling framework includes standard transects (Pollard walks), Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS), and targeted surveys (single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
  - All data types are analyzed together to produce population indices.

- Nature of data collected
  - Abundance indices derived from counts along transects and site surveys, representing relative rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Site indices are combined into species-level indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with site-year weighting based on the proportion of the species flight period surveyed.
  - The seasonal pattern is estimated from all counts (including gaps) to extrapolate observed data when recording is incomplete.

- Data quality and control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
  - Data uploaded to a central database; automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate records and perform ongoing checks throughout the season.
  - Additional automated and manual validation targets inconsistencies such as distribution range, flight period, first-time site records, and atypical abundances.
  - Corrections are made through queries and, if needed, by direct edits to the UKBMS dataset after coordination.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides location and attribute data for UK butterfly monitoring sites from 1976 to 2020; sensitive sites are excluded.
  - Delivered as a CSV file; includes fields such as site number, site name, grid references (OS), easting/northing, transect length, country, number of sections, years surveyed, first/last survey year, and survey type (UKBMS standard vs WCBS).
