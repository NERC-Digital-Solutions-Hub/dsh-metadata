# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview: A long-running, multi-organization data program funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Relies on volunteers to collect annual population data for butterflies across the UK, with data from all sampling methods combined to inform biodiversity status and policy questions. Since 1976, monitoring >2,500 actively recorded sites per year.

- Data collection frameworks:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, recording all species in a ~5 m band weekly from April–September (up to 26 counts/year); ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits per square per year (July/August core), aimed at common habitats; ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: Single-species transects, “timed counts,” and egg/larval web counts using methods focused on specific species.

- Nature of data and trend analysis:
  - Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Seasonal indices are combined across sites using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a 2016 modification that weights each site/year by the proportion of its species flight period surveyed.
  - All counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS are used to model seasonal counts and fill gaps, with observed data given more influence than extrapolated data.

- Quality control:
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; automated and manual validation screens for range/distribution consistency, first-time site records, and atypical abundances.
  - Corrections and dataset edits are made as needed based on validation discussions.

- Details of this data download:
  - Provides location and attribute data for UK sites monitored from 1976 to 2020; sensitive sites excluded; delivered as CSV.
  - Key columns include site number, site name, grid reference, easting/northing, transect length, country, number of sections, years surveyed, first/last year surveyed, and survey type (UKBMS or WCBS).

- Licence and attribution:
  - Open Government Licence (OGL) for data use, with requirements to cite the dataset and include the specified attribution statement.
  - Since 2017, submitters agreed to OGL for data submission; historic data may have third-party IP considerations; contact provided for issues.

- Offer of collaboration and contact details:
  - UKBMS partners welcome advisory input, outputs interpretation, and potential co-authorship on publications resulting from data use.
