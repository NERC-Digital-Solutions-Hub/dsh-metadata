# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- What it is and who runs it
  - A nationwide, site-based butterfly monitoring program organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
  - Supported by volunteers; aims to provide annual data on butterfly population status to inform biodiversity policy questions.
  - Sampling framework includes: standard Pollard walks (2–4 km transects, weekly up to 26 times/year), Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS; stratified 1km squares with 2–3 visits/year), and targeted surveys (single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts).

- Nature of data collected and analysis
  - Produces abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts.
  - Indices are generated from counts across all sampling methods and are combined to create species-specific collated indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with year- and site-level weighting based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
  - The method accounts for gaps in recording by estimating seasonal activity patterns and extrapolating data, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

- Quality control and data validation
  - Field data captured on standard forms, entered online via the UKBMS data entry system or Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automatic checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods); regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
  - Additional automated/manual validations screen for: records outside known distributions, out-of-season records, first-time site records, atypical abundances; corrections are implemented through queries and coordinator input.
