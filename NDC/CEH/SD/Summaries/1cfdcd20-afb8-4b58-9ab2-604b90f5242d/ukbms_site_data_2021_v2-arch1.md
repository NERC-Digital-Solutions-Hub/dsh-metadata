# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - A long-running population monitoring program for UK butterflies, organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
  - Thanks to volunteer contribution, the scheme tracks butterfly abundance across the UK since 1976, currently with over 2500 actively recorded sites each year.
  - Data support understanding of biodiversity status and policy-relevant trends.

- Sampling framework (components)
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, weekly counts up to 26 times per year, typically 45 minutes to 2 hours, about 2000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (plus encouraged spring visits), ~800 squares annually.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on particular species.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Data yield abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Site indices reflect a constant proportion of the population observed, with detectability varying by species.
  - Species-wide indices produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting by the proportion of the species’ flight period observed at each site/year.

- Quality control and data validation
  - Field data collected on standard forms and entered online (via UKBMS portal or Transect Walker) with automatic checks for entry errors.
  - Regional transect coordinators review and validate records, with ongoing checks during the season.
  - Automated/manual validation to flag records outside known distribution, out-of-season records, first-time site records, unusually high abundances, or atypical site-year patterns; edits made after data queries and consultations.
