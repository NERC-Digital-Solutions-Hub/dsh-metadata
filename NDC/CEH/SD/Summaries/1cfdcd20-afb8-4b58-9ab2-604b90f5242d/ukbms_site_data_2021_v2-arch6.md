# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with thanks to volunteers.
- It has monitored butterfly population changes across the UK since 1976, currently involving over 2,500 active sites each year.
- Data come from a mix of site-based monitoring methods:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks) with weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year, 2–4 km transects).
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS) using stratified 1 km squares with 2–3 visits/year.
  - Targeted surveys (single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species or methods.
- All sampling methods contribute to a unified UKBMS dataset used to understand butterfly status and biodiversity trends and to inform policy questions.

- Data collection and structure:
  - Abundance indices are used as relative measures of population size, reflecting a constant proportion of the actual population per site with species-specific detectability.
  - Seasonal patterns across a year are estimated with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), weighting site-year data by the proportion of the species’ flight period observed to emphasize observed counts over extrapolated data.
  - Data from all methods are analyzed together to produce collated species indices.

- Data quality control:
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag unusual counts and records outside known flight periods; regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
  - Further automated/manual validation screens for: out-of-range distributions, records outside normal flight periods, first-time site records, unusually high or anomalous abundances.
  - Corrections are made through queries and discussions with coordinators; edits update the main UKBMS dataset.
