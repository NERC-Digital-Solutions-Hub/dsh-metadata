# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - An annual, site-based monitoring program organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.
  - Relies on volunteers; aims to show environmental health and policy-relevant trends over time.
  - Since 1976, with over 2,500 active sites each year; data cover a range of butterfly species and habitats.
  - All sampling methods are analyzed together to produce national and species-level trend indicators.

- Nature of data collected
  - Use of abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts.
  - Three main data components:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, counts every week from April to September (ideally 26 counts/year).
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits/year (July/August targeted), sampling common habitats.
    - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for particular species.
  - Data integration uses the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with year/site weighting based on surveyed flight period; combines counts across all methods to estimate seasonal patterns and fill gaps.

- Data quality control
  - Field data collected on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker software.
  - Automated and manual validation, including checks for unusually high counts, mis-timings, or species outside known ranges.
  - Regional transect coordinators review data; iterative queries fix errors before final dataset updates.
