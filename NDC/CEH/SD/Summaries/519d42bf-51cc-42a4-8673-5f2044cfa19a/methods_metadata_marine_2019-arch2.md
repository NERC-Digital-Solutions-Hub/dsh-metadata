# Methods, metadata and summary for marine monitoring at Akrotiri and Dhekelia between April 2017 and September 2018

- Project context
  - Part of Defra Darwin Initiative Plus Project DPLUS056: Assessment and monitoring of current and future IAS in Cyprus, focusing on baseline data for native and non-native marine species in the Akrotiri and Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area.
  - Organizations: University of Cyprus conducted sampling with volunteer divers from the Western Sovereign Base Area Sub Aqua Club.

- Monitoring approach and study design
  - Methodology: Underwater Visual Census (UVC) to record marine invasive species.
  - Sampling site: Area in front of the Sub-aqua club, RAF Akrotiri; baseline survey extended to Dhekelia.
  - Temporal coverage: Seasonal sampling conducted between April 2017 and September 2018.
  - Transect design: On each sampling date, a randomly placed 85 m transect covering available habitats (seagrass beds, rocky habitats) with three replicate 25 m transects separated by 5 m gaps.
  - Fish assessments: Strip transects (25 m x 5 m, with 2.5 m on either side) where divers record observed fish species and estimate abundance.
  - Benthic assessments: Point-intercept photo transects along the three 25 m transects; a 20 x 20 cm quadrat is placed every 1 m along each transect, photographed with an underwater camera; species and abundance derived from photos.
  - Data collection format: Standardized field procedures carried out by UCY staff and trained volunteers.

- Data and metadata structure
  - Data files (CSV):
    - akrotiri_marine_2017_2019: sampling site location and fish species abundance.
    - akrotiri_marine_quadrats_2017_2018: sampling site location and benthic species abundance (percent cover).
  - Data columns (examples):
    - akrotiri_marine_2017_2019: Date, Site_code, Site_full_name, Lat, Lon, Species, Species_common, Taxonomic_group, Abundance (ACFOR), Abundance_num, Method.
    - akrotiri_marine_quadrats_2017_2018: Date, Site_code, Site_full_name, Lat, Lon, Species, Taxonomic_group, Species_Cov_% , Method.
  - Data quality and management: All equipment and protocols developed by experienced UCY staff; incoming data reviewed and digitised by UCY staff, ensuring quality assurance/quality control.

- Significance for monitoring and data reuse
  - Provides a standardized, transparent dataset for assessing native vs. non-native marine species over time in a defined marine area.
  - Facilitates cross-site and temporal comparisons through consistent methods (UVC, transects, quadrats) and detailed metadata.
  - Supports data sharing and long-term monitoring by documenting methodology, sampling effort, and data structure.
