# Methods, metadata and summary for marine monitoring at Akrotiri and Dhekelia between April 2017 and September 2018

- Project context
  - Part of Defra Darwin Initiative Plus Project DPLUS056: Assessing current and future invasive alien species (IAS) in Cyprus to establish baseline data on native and non-native marine species in the Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri and Dhekelia.
  - Organizations: University of Cyprus (UCY) and volunteer divers from the Western Sovereign Base Area Sub Aqua Club.

- Monitoring design and methods
  - Underwater Visual Census (UVC) used to record marine invasive species.
  - Seasonal sampling at the area in front of the Sub-aqua club, RAF base, Akrotiri.
  - Fish assessments:
    - Strip transects 25 m long by 2 m wide, along a 25 m transect, recording species and abundance within 2.5 m on each side.
    - Three replicate transects per sampling event arranged along an 85 m total transect with sequence: 25 m transect, 5 m gap, 25 m transect, 5 m gap, 25 m transect.
  - Benthic (algae and invertebrates) sampling:
    - Point intercept photo transects along all three 25 m transects.
    - 20 x 20 cm PVC quadrats placed every 1 m along the transect; quadrats photographed with GoPro and analyzed for species and abundance from images.
  - Baseline surveys:
    - In addition to Akrotiri, a baseline survey conducted in Dhekelia.

- Metadata and data structure
  - Data stored in CSV spreadsheets:
    - akrotiri_marine_2017_2019: sampling site location and fish species abundance
    - akrotiri_marine_quadrats_2017_2018: sampling site location and quadrat species abundance (benthic)
  - Data columns (examples):
    - Date, Site_code, Site_full_name, Lat, Lon, Species, Taxonomic_group, Abundance, Abundance_num, Method (for fish data)
    - Date, Site_code, Site_full_name, Lat, Lon, Species, Taxonomic_group, Species_Cov_%, Method (for quadrat data)
  - Abundance framework:
    - ACFOR scale for abundance; numerical equivalents provided (Abundance_num)
  - Data quality and processing:
    - Quality control/assurance conducted by UCY staff
    - Equipment and methods developed by experienced UCY personnel
    - Incoming data reviewed and digitised by UCY staff

- Data governance and accessibility considerations
  - Data collection is standardized and documented to support reliability and comparability over time.
  - Metadata extensively described to enable data interpretation and reuse.
  - Data produced to support assessment of IAS baseline status and inform policy and management decisions.

- Endnotes and implications for monitoring framework authors
  - The study provides a clear, repeatable monitoring protocol linking methods, spatial-temporal sampling design, and detailed metadata.
  - Emphasizes collaboration with volunteers and capacity-building through method dissemination and QA procedures.
  - Produces structured, policy-relevant outputs (species abundances, cover metrics) suitable for informing environmental health decisions and future monitoring iterations.
