# Methods, metadata and summary for marine monitoring at Akrotiri and Dhekelia between April 2017 and September 2018

## Project context
- Defra Darwin Initiative Plus Project DPLUS056: Assessment and monitoring of current and future IAS in Cyprus to establish baseline data on native and non-native marine species in the Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri and Dhekelia.
- Organisations: University of Cyprus (UCY) and volunteer divers from the Western Sovereign Base Area Sub Aqua Club.

## Study design and sampling methods
- Primary method: Underwater Visual Census (UVC) to record marine invasive species.
- Sampling location: In front of the Sub-aqua club, RAF base at Akrotiri; baseline survey also conducted in Dhekelia.
- Seasonal sampling: Conducted throughout the year on multiple dates.
- Transect layout (Akrotiri):
  - Transect length: 85 m total, randomly placed.
  - Three replicate transects per sampling date: 25 m each with 5 m gaps between them.
  - Habitats targeted: Seagrass beds and rocky habitats where possible.
- Fish assessments:
  - Method: Strip transects 25 m long × 5 m wide.
  - Procedure: Divers record fish within 2.5 m on each side of the transect; species and abundances logged.
- Benthic (algae and invertebrates) recording:
  - Method: Point intercept photo transects along the three replicate transects.
  - Quadrat sampling: Along each 25 m transect, a 20 cm × 20 cm PVC quadrat placed every 1 m.
  - Data collection: GoPro video/photo inside each quadrat; species and abundance recorded from photos.
- Baseline data: Additional baseline survey conducted in Dhekelia.
