# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) Manual for wood specific gravity (WSD) and wood density at 12% moisture content (D12) determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (Manual No 4)

## Overview
- Purpose: complete national and international data on wood specific gravity (WSG) to support accurate biomass (aboveground and root) and carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.
- Period and updates: 2014–2016; updated July 2018.
- Leadership and funding: led by the School of Agronomy - Department of Water and Forests; co-funded by Francophone University Agency (AUF) and International Foundation for Science (IFS).
- Data archiving: all datasets generated are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Field process
- Collaborate with local botanists to confirm species presence locally and align local names with scientific names.
- Select healthy trees (no hollow/decay) and collect 15 mm wood cores at ~1.30 m height.
- Sampling: 10 trees per species (5 with diameter < 15 cm, 5 > 15 cm).
- Procedures: fill holes to prevent biotic attack, preserve cores, record PHF index, estimated height, DBH, and collect herbarium specimens.
- Species verification: confirm scientific names with botanists from PBZT (Herbarium of Tsimbazaza, Antananarivo).

## Lab process
- Prepare cores: cut 1 cm segments (bark removed) from each core.
- Moisture stabilization: condition segments at 20°C and 65% RH for 7 days to reach 12% moisture content; stability checked when weight is constant for 3 consecutive days.
- D12 measurement: determine volume at 12% MC (V12) by Archimedes method; weigh (M12) at 12% MC.
- Oven-drying: oven-dry segments at 103°C to constant weight (anhydrous state, 0% MC) and weigh (Manhy).
- Saturation: re-immerse in water for 3 days to reach saturated state; determine saturated volume (VSat) by Archimedes method.
- Calculations:
  - D12 = M12 / V12 (relative to water density)
  - WSG = Manhy / VSAT (relative to water density)

## Data management and archiving
- Data products: wood specific gravity (WSG) and wood density at 12% MC (D12) per segment.
- Data storage: archived datasets at EIDC to support transparency, discoverability, and future reuse.

## Collaboration and funding
- Partners: AUF, IFS, and PBZT herbarium for species verification.
- Data lineage: clearly documented field and lab procedures to enable reproducibility and aggregation for biomass/carbon assessments.

## Outputs, usage, and references
- Primary outputs: WSG and D12 values to inform biomass and carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.
- Methodological basis: follows the standard protocol referenced from Williamson and Wiemann (2010) for accurate wood specific gravity measurements.
