# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon)
Manual for wood specific gravity (WSD) and wood density at 12% moisture content (D12) determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor
(Manual No 4)

## Objective
- Provide field and laboratory procedures to determine wood specific gravity (WSG) and density at 12% moisture content (D12) to support accurate biomass and carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.

## Period, leadership and data archiving
- Period: 2014–2016; Updated July 2018.
- Lead: School of Agronomy - Department of Water and Forests; co-funded by AUF and IFS.
- Data: All datasets generated archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Field process: collection of wood samples
- Collaborate with local botanists to verify species local names and scientific names.
- Select healthy trees (no hollow/decay); determine location/identification with botanist.
- Collect 15 mm-diameter wood cores using an electric drill at ~1.30 m height.
- Sample design: 10 trees per species (5 trees with DBH < 15 cm; 5 trees with DBH > 15 cm).
- Fill holes with branch material to prevent biotic attack; preserve cores.
- Collect PHF index, visually estimate height and DBH with a caliper.
- Collect herbarium material (leaves, flowers, fruits) and store appropriately.
- Confirm species names with PBZT botanists.

## Laboratory process: measurement of WSG and D12
- Prepare each core by cutting 1 cm segments (bark removed).
- Stabilize segments at 20°C and 65% relative humidity for 7 days to reach 12% moisture content (MC); stable if weight constant for 3 consecutive days.
- Measure volume at 12% MC (V12) via Archimedes water displacement; measure weight at 12% MC (M12).
- Over-dry segments at 103°C to constant weight to obtain anhydrous weight (Manhy).
- Immerse segments in water for 3 days to achieve saturated state; measure saturated volume (VSat) via Archimedes method.
- Calculations (per segment):
  - D12 = M12 / V12 (density at 12% MC)
  - WSG = Manhy / VSat (wood specific gravity, oven-dry weight / saturated volume)
- Basis: relative to density of water; reference method Williamson & Wiemann (2010).

## Data use and outputs
- Generate standardized WSG and D12 values to support aboveground and root biomass and carbon accounting.
- Ensure compatibility with broader datasets and forest carbon assessments.

## Data management and accessibility
- Datasets archived at EIDC; outputs intended for storage in appropriate portals.
- Aligns with goals to increase dataset value and enable access to underlying data for broader use.
