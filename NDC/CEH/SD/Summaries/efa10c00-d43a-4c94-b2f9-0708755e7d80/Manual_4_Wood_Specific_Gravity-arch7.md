# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) Manual for wood specific gravity (WSD) and wood density at 12% moisture content (D12) determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (Manual No 4)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provide standardized methods to determine wood specific gravity (WSG) and density at 12% moisture content (D12) for biomass and carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.
  - Archive generated datasets at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) for traceability.

- Study context
  - Area: Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor.
  - Period: Field work 2014–2016; updated methodology July 2018.
  - Team: Led by the School of Agronomy – Department of Water and Forests; co-funded by AUF and IFS.

- Field process: sample collection
  - Collaborate with local botanists to confirm species presence and match local and scientific names.
  - Select healthy trees; collect 15 mm wood cores at 1.30 m above ground from each tree.
  - Sampling design: 10 trees per species (5 trees with DBH < 15 cm and 5 trees with DBH > 15 cm) to capture intraspecies variation.
  - Actions: fill bore holes with branches, preserve cores, record PHF index, measure height and DBH, collect herbarium specimens, and verify scientific names with PBZT.

- Lab process: measuring WSD and D12
  - Sample preparation: cut 1 cm segments from cores; condition at 20°C and 65% RH to reach 12% MC, confirming stability over 3 days.
  - Volume and weight measurements at 12% MC: V12 via Archimedes method; M12 with 0.01 g precision.
  - Drying: oven-dry segments at 103°C to constant weight (anhydrous state, Manhy).
  - Saturation: re-immerse in water for 3 days; determine saturated volume (VSat) via Archimedes method.
  - Calculations:
    - D12 = M12 / V12 (density at 12% moisture content, relative to water).
    - WSG = Manhy / VSat (oven-dry weight over saturated volume, relative to water).
  - Reference protocol: Williamson & Wiemann (2010) for correct measurement approach.

- Data management and applicability
  - Output: per-segment WSG and D12 values enabling precise biomass and carbon estimates.
  - Data are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) to support data sharing and interoperability.
  - Methodology supports cross-site comparability and integration with spatial data for GIS-based biomass/carbon mapping.

- Relevance for GIS specialists
  - Enables creation of map-based biomass and carbon visualizations with species- and size-class resolution.
  - Provides standardized, QA-friendly data suitable for layering with spatial layers (species distribution, tree density, forest structure).
  - Highlights data provenance, standardization, and potential needs for harmonizing data standards across datasets.
