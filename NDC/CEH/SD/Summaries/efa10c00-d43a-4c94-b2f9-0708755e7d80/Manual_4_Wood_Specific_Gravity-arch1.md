# Manual for wood specific gravity (WSD) and wood density at 12% moisture content (D12) determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor

## Overview
- Purpose: to generate local values of wood specific gravity (WSG) and density at 12% moisture content (D12) for accurate aboveground/root biomass and carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.
- Scope: field collection of samples and laboratory measurements to compute WSG and D12 for multiple species.
- Project context: ESPA p4ges PROJECT, WP4-Carbon (2014–2016; updated July 2018); led by the School of Agronomy – Department of Water and Forests; co-funded by AUF and IFS; data archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Field process: collection of wood samples
- Engage with local botanists to confirm species presence, local names, and match to scientific names.
- Select healthy trees (no hollow decay) for sampling.
- Sample 15 mm-diameter wood cores using an electric drill powered by a generator, at 1.30 m above ground.
- For each species, collect from 10 trees: 5 with DBH < 15 cm and 5 with DBH > 15 cm to capture variation.
- Fill bore holes with branch material to reduce fungal attack; preserve cores in bags.
- Record additional tree measurements: PHF index, height visual estimates, diameter at breast height (DBH) with calipers.
- Collect herbarium material (leaves, flowers, fruits if available) and verify species names with the PBZT herbarium in Antananarivo.

## Laboratory process: measurement of wood specific gravity and density at 12% moisture content
- Prepare 1 cm long bark-free segments from each core for testing.
- Stabilize segments at 20°C and 65% relative humidity for 7 days to reach approximately 12% moisture content (MC); consider segment stable when weight is constant for 3 consecutive days.
- Determine volume at 12% MC (V12) via Archimedes water displacement method.
- Determine 12% MC weight (M12) with a precision balance (0.01 g).
- Over-dry segments in a 103°C oven until constant weight to obtain anhydrous weight (Manhy) (0% humidity), measured with a precision balance (0.01 g).
- Immerse segments in water for 3 days to reach saturated state; measure saturated volume (VSat) by Archimedes displacement.
- Calculations:
  - D12 = M12 / V12 (density at 12% MC, relative to water)
  - WSG = Manhy / VSat (wood-specific gravity, relative to water)

## Calculations and standards
- Use standardized methods for 12% MC stabilization, density at 12% MC, and WSG via Archimedes principles.
- Reference method: Williamson and Wiemann (2010) for correct measurement approaches to wood specific gravity.
- Documentation aims to produce reproducible, comparable WSG and D12 values across species and sites.

## Data management and dissemination
- All datasets generated by this methodology are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- Data and samples are managed to support national and international biomass and carbon accounting efforts.
- Supporting activities include herbarium vouchers and species verification to ensure data quality and taxonomic accuracy.
