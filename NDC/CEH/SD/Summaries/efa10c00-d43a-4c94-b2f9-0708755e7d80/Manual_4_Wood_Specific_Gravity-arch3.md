## Overview
- Purpose: to complete national and international data on wood specific gravity (WSG) and density at 12% moisture content (D12) for accurate aboveground and root biomass and carbon accounting in the humid tropical forest.
- Output: datasets archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) to support biomass/carbon assessments.
- Governance: led by the School of Agronomy - Department of Water and Forests; co-funded by AUF and IFS; collaboration with local botanists and herbarium specialists; alignment with standardized measurement practices (referencing established methods).

## Field process: collection of wood samples
- Collaboration with local botanists to confirm species presence and local vs scientific names.
- Selection criteria: healthy trees (no hollow/decay in trunk).
- Sampling design: 15 mm-diameter wood cores collected from each tree; 10 trees per species (5 with DBH < 15 cm; 5 with DBH > 15 cm).
- Sample handling: cores preserved in bags; holes filled with branches to prevent biotic attack.
- Associated data: PHF index, visual height estimation, diameter at breast height (DBH) with caliper.
- Documentation and identification: herbarium collection (leaves, flowers, fruits) and verification of species names with herbarium specialists at PBZT, Antananarivo.

## Laboratory process: measurement of WSD (WSD) and D12
- Sample preparation: 1 cm long segments cut from each core (bark removed).
- Stabilization: segments kept at 20°C and 65% relative humidity for 7 days to reach 12% moisture content; stability confirmed when weight is constant for 3 consecutive days.
- 12% MC measurements:
  - Volume at 12% MC (V12) determined by Archimedes water displacement.
  - Weight at 12% MC (M12) measured with precision balance (0.01 g).
- Drying and dry-state measurements:
  - Over-drying to anhydrous state (0% humidity) at 103°C until constant weight (Manhy) is reached.
  - Oven-dry weight measured (0.01 g precision).
- Saturation measurements:
  - Segments immersed in water for 3 days to reach saturated state.
  - Saturated volume (VSat) determined by water displacement (Archimedes method).
- Calculations:
  - D12 = M12 / V12 (density at 12% moisture content, referenced to water density).
  - WSG = Manhy / VSat (wood specific gravity, oven-dry weight by saturated volume, referenced to water density).

## Data management and archiving
- All datasets generated under this manual are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) to ensure accessibility and transparency.
- Data should support robust biomass and carbon accounting and enable cross-study comparability.

## Key considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Standardization: explicit field and lab protocols to ensure reproducible WSG/D12 measurements across sites and times.
- Data quality: multiple trees per species, careful species identification, and documented provenance.
- Metadata and sharing: emphasis on clear documentation (species IDs, measurement methods, conditions) to facilitate verification and reuse; datasets intended for public sharing where appropriate.
- Data governance: procedures to preserve data integrity, storage, and updates (e.g., maintaining sample records, lab notes, and archived measurements).
