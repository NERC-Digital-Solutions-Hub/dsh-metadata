# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) Manual for wood specific gravity (WSD) and wood density at 12% moisture content (D12) determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (Manual No 4)

## Overview
- Purpose: to complete national and international data on wood specific gravity (WSG) for accurate biomass (aboveground and root) and carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.
- Period: 2014–2016; updated July 2018.
- Lead and funding: School of Agronomy – Department of Water and Forests; co-funding from Francophone University Agency AUF and International Foundation for Science IFS.
- Data archiving: all datasets generated by the methodology in this manual are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Scope of datasets
- Data describe wood specific gravity (WSG) and wood density at 12% moisture content (D12) for wood samples collected and analyzed under the manual.
- Datasets support biomass and carbon accounting and are tied to field and laboratory measurements.

## Methods

### Field process
- Collaborate with local botanists to confirm species local names and local presence; verify scientific names.
- Tree selection: healthy trees (not hollow/decayed); collect 15 mm-diameter wood cores at approximately 1.3 m above ground.
- Sampling plan: 10 trees per species (5 with diameter < 15 cm; 5 with diameter > 15 cm).
- Procedures: fill holes with branch material to reduce biotic attack; preserve cores; collect PHF index, visual height, and diameter at breast height (DBH) with a tree caliper.
- Herbarium: collect leaves, flowers, fruits when available; store specimens between newspaper sheets.
- Species verification: confirm scientific names with herbarium staff from PBZT (Botanical and Zoological Garden of Tsimbazaza), Antananarivo.

### Laboratory processes
- Segment preparation: cut 1 cm-long bark-free segments from each core.
- Moisture conditioning: stabilize at 20°C and 65% RH for 7 days to reach 12% moisture content; stable when weight is constant for 3 consecutive days.
- Volume and weight measurements at 12% MC: measure V12 by Archimedes water displacement; measure M12 with a precision balance (0.01 g).
- Oven-drying: over-dry to obtain anhydrous state (0% humidity); measure Manhy (oven-dried weight) with 0.01 g precision.
- Saturation: immerse segments in water for 3 days; measure saturated volume (VSat) by Archimedes displacement.
- Calculations: 
  - D12 = M12 / V12 (density at 12% MC, relative to water density)
  - WSG = Manhy / VSat (wood specific gravity, relative to water density)
- Reference: Williamson, G.B., Wiemann, M.C. (2010) Measuring wood specific gravity… correctly.

## Data Governance and Archiving
- All generated datasets are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC), ensuring preservation and future discoverability.
- Documentation includes provenance from field collection through lab analysis, enabling biomass and carbon calculations.

## Roles and Collaborations
- Lead team: School of Agronomy – Department of Water and Forests.
- Funders/partners: AUF and IFS.
- Collaborators: local botanists, PBZT herbarium team, and other cooperation partners.

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- Emphasize rigorous metadata: species verification, site location, PHF index, height, DBH, sample IDs, and lab measurements (M12, V12, Manhy, VSat, VSAT).
- Maintain data provenance from field collection to laboratory results; link core segments to their source trees and species.
- Ensure data quality and standardization by adhering to the documented protocols and measurement methods; preserve and index datasets in EIDC for discoverability and reuse in biomass/carbon assessments.
