# Manual for wood specific gravity (WSD) and wood density at 12% moisture content (D12) determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor

## Purpose and data context
- Aimed to complete national and international data on wood specific gravity (WSG) for accurate biomass (aboveground and root) and carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.
- All generated datasets are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Field sampling process
- Collaboration with local botanists to confirm species presence locally and align local names with scientific names.
- Forest identification of trees by botanists; only healthy trees (not hollow or decayed) selected.
- Collection of 15 mm-diameter wood cores from each tree at 1.30 m above ground using an electric drill (no tree harvesting).
- Sampling design: 10 trees per species (5 with diameter < 15 cm and 5 with diameter > 15 cm).
- Holes filled with branches to deter biological attack; cores preserved in bags.
- Recording of additional metadata: PHF index, visual height estimation, diameter at breast height (DBH) with calipers; herbarium specimens collected and stored; local species names verified with herbarium (PBZT) staff.

## Laboratory processing and measurements
- Core processing: cut 1 cm long barkless segments from each core.
- Equilibration to 12% moisture content (MC) in a climatic chamber at 20°C and 65% relative humidity for 7 days; stability confirmed when weight unchanged for 3 consecutive days.
- 12% MC measurements:
  - Volume at 12% MC (V12) via Archimedes water displacement.
  - Weight at 12% MC (M12) with a precision balance to 0.01 g.
- Oven-dry progression to anhydrous state (0% MC) at 103°C (24 hours) and measurement of anhydrous weight (Manhy).
- Saturation process: immerse segments in water for 3 days to reach a saturated state; measure saturated volume (VSat) via Archimedes displacement.
- Calculations:
  - Density at 12% MC (D12) = M12 / V12 (relative to water density).
  - Wood specific gravity (WSG) = Manhy / VSat (relative to water density).

## Data products and usage
- Generated per-segment values for D12 and WSG, enabling biomass and carbon accounting analyses.
- Field metadata collected include species name verification, DBH, estimated height, and PHF index to support context and quality checks.
- Datasets (field and laboratory results) are archived at EIDC for access by researchers and practitioners.

## Data quality and standards
- Use of standardized laboratory procedures aligned with established methods (Archimedes principle) for volume and density measurements.
- Methodology validated by reference (Williamson & Wiemann, 2010) and applied consistently across samples.

## Period, leadership, and funding
- Field and laboratory work conducted during 2014–2016; manual updated in July 2018.
- Lead coordination by the School of Agronomy - Department of Water and Forests; co-funded by Francophone University Agency (AUF) and International Foundation for Science (IFS).

## Data provenance and accessibility
- Datasets generated from a clearly documented sampling protocol and lab procedures.
- All data archived and accessible via the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
