# Study sites and focal species

- Objective: Compare how shade-house grown seedlings respond to different phosphorus (P) forms across two forest biomes, enabling generalization of findings via map-based data products.
- Settings: Two field sites with ECM- vs AM-dominated overstoreys and diverse understoreys
  - Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia
  - Heishiding Nature Reserve, Guangdong, China
- Site characteristics (for GIS context)
  - Kabili-Sepilok: 5°49'N, 117°57'E; ~5543 ha; lowland tropical rainforest; mean annual rainfall ~2975 mm; temperatures ~26.7–27.7 °C
  - Heishiding: 111°53'E, 23°27'N; 150–927 m a.s.l.; subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest; mean annual temperature ~19.6 °C; ~1744 mm annual rainfall
- Experimental design overview
  - Shade-house experiments with experimentally germinated seedlings
  - Eight focal tree species per site (4–6 ECM or AM per site; see species table)
  - Randomized blocks used to control for micro-environment
  - 5 phosphorus (P) treatments per species: Water (control), Na3PO4 (inorganic), AMP (simple organic), Phytic acid (complex organic), Mixture (1/3 of each)
  - 12 blocks per site; each block contains all 40 pots (8 species × 5 P treatments)
  - Total pots per site: 480; total across both sites: 960
- Data collection and structure (GIS-ready notes)
  - Measurements collected at end of 6-month growth: seedling height, shoot+root biomass, root colonization status
  - Leaf and soil nutrient analyses conducted for N, P, K and soil available P
  - Mycorrhizal assessment performed separately for AM and ECM plants
  - Data are organized into a single dataset with clearly defined columns (A–L) capturing site, block, treatment, species, mycorrhizal type, and plant/soil metrics
- Key data fields (for GIS linking and mapping)
  - Site: Sepilok (Malaysia) or Heishiding (China)
  - Block: 1–24 (1–12 Sepilok, 13–24 Heishiding)
  - Ptreatment: 1–5 (P treatment codes)
  - P: Water, Na3PO4, AMP, Phytic acid, Mixture
  - Species: code A–H; SpName with binomial names
  - MycorrhizalType: ECM or AM
  - Height: seedling height in cm
  - TotalBiomass: total dry mass in g
  - TotalBiomassStandard: biomass scaled to species maximum
  - RootBiomass: root mass in g
  - RootColonization: proportion of colonized roots (AM) or root tips (ECM)
- Data collection and laboratory methods (context for metadata)
  - Seed sterilization and germination in sterilized sand; transplantation into pots with a 1:1 field soil:sand mix
  - Live soil inoculum sourced from beneath adult trees of focal species
  - P treatments repeated monthly for 6 months
  - Biomass and height measured at harvest
  - Leaf N, P, K via Kjeldahl and ICP-OES; soil Olsen-P via standard Olsen method
  - AM colonization: gridline intersection; ECM colonization: counting ECM root tips
  - Pseudocode for dataset fields (A–L) aligns with the described data structure
- Data quality, scope, and limitations
  - Seedling survival varied by species and site; Canarium album excluded from Heishiding due to low survival
  - Data include NA where root colonization or sampling did not occur
  - Cross-site comparability achieved through consistent experimental design and measurement protocols
- GIS application considerations
  - Integrate with site climate, soil, and vegetation layers for spatial visualization of responses by mycorrhizal type and P treatment
  - Visualize trait distributions (height, biomass) and mycorrhizal colonization across sites and species
  - Use coded fields (Site, Block, Ptreatment, P, Species, MycorrhizalType) for filtering and join operations in GIS
  - Potential to build predictive maps of growth responses under different nutrient forms and mycorrhizal associations
- Data interoperability and metadata needs
  - Standardized codes for sites, blocks, species, and treatments facilitate integration with other datasets
  - Documentation of measurement methods (Kjeldahl, Olsen P, MIC analyses, staining and counting protocols) essential for reproducibility in GIS-enabled analyses
