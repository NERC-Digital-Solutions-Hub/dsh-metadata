# Flood risk assessment of the Luanhe river basin under different development strategies and climate scenarios

## Aim
- Describes data needed and results produced by a flood risk assessment framework for the Luanhe river basin under varied development strategies and climate scenarios up to 2030.

## Data collection / generation
- Data used include: climate uplifts to 2030, historical flood validation (2012), flood inundation predictions under different strategies and climate scenarios to 2030, and a 2030 resident population density map.
- Climate uplifts derived from NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) to represent future design rainfall.
- Validation uses a 2012 flood event with remote sensing observations; HiPIMS model produces inundation predictions.
- Predicted inundation is overlaid with GPWv4 population data to generate local flood risk maps.
- All data are open data or produced by the authors.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Climate uplifts to 2030: dimensionless numbers describing climate impact on future 100-year design rainfall.
- 2012 validation: remote sensing data (unit -) and HiPIMS inundation (meters).
- Inundation predictions to 2030: HiPIMS model results (meters).
- Population density: persons per square kilometer.

## Quality control
- HiPIMS has been used in prior flood risk projects and validated.
- The dataset is well documented and submitted to peer-reviewed venues, providing robust estimates.
- NEX-GDDP and GPWv4 are widely used open datasets.

## Data structure (formats)
- Climate uplifts: CSV files (Tab 1); other data: TIFF files (Tab 2).
- Details are provided in Tabs 1 and 2.

## Datasets
- Flood model validation: Validation.tif (numerical simulation) and RemoteSensing_validation.tif (remote sensing data); Open Government Licence; Loughborough University.
- Climate change uplifts: rcp45.csv and rcp85.csv (city; uplift values); Open Government Licence; Loughborough University.
- Inundation map: flood simulation results for different climate and infrastructure scenarios; Open Government Licence; Loughborough University.
- Population data: resampled GPWv4 data; Open Government Licence; Loughborough University.

## Flood scenarios to support flood risk analysis
- P = Panjiakou Reservoir (including Daheiting); S = Shuangfengsi Reservoir.
- Scenarios combine land use (2015) with 100-year design rainfall under Baseline, RCP4.5, RCP8.5, and 2030 trends (Trend, Trend_RCP4.5, Trend_RCP8.5) with P/S variants (and expansions/conservations/sustainability where noted).

## Licensing and access
- Datasets are provided under Open Government Licence.
