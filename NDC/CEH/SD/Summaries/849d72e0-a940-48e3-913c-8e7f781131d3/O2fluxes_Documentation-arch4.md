# Overview of data

- Purpose and scope
  - Compilation of results from the stream metabolism component of the NERC Macronutrients consortium, led by Prof. Mark Trimmer, focusing on the role of lateral exchange in the seaward flux of C, N and P.
  - Data generated in the field by L. Rovelli, K. Attard, and Assoc. Prof. H. Stahl under Prof. R.N. Glud; one dataset accompanies this overview: O2fluxes_Avon.CSV.
  - Four field campaigns measuring oxygen production/consumption (O2 fluxes) at the streambed (benthic) and in the water column across rivers with different land-river connectivity in the Hampshire Avon catchment.

- Data assets and contents
  - Dataset: O2fluxes_Avon.CSV; accompanied by this overview; includes site coordinates and campaign details.
  - Sites (six tributaries): CE1 Ebble, GA2 Avon, GN1 Nadder, CW2 Wylye, AS1 Sem, AS2 Sem.
  - Sites’ coordinates provided for mapping purposes.
  - Campaigns: Spring 2013, Summer 2013, Autumn 2013, Winter 2014.
  - Depth: average stream depth in meters (based on flow transect measurements).
  - Benthic fluxes (b): Day flux and Night flux in mmol/m2/h with SE; counts in parentheses; Total PAR (b) in mol/m2/d; Daylight (b) in hours.
  - Water-column fluxes (w): Day flux and Night flux in µmol/L/h with SE; Total PAR (w) in mol/m2/d; Daylight (w) in hours; rates below detection marked as <0.1 µmol/L/h.
  - Column headers explicitly document the variables and units.

- Methods and data processing
  - Benthic O2 fluxes obtained using aquatic eddy covariance (AEC); protocol described by Berg et al. (2003) and processed per Attard et al. (2014) and Rovelli et al. (2015).
  - Water-column O2 fluxes measured via incubation with 100 mL bottles over 24 hours, using optical O2 sensors.
  - Data collection occurred across four campaigns (spring, summer, autumn 2013, winter 2014) at six tributaries of the Hampshire River Avon catchment.
  - Site-level metadata includes exact latitude/longitude for each site.

- Data quality, limitations, and caveats
  - Some data omitted due to quality concerns: winter data at GA2 and autumn data at GA2 were excluded; CE1 winter sampling not conducted due to flooding.
  - Missing data indicated as not determined (n.d.) where applicable.
  - Potential data quality and standardization considerations noted, requiring careful interpretation of benthic vs. water-column fluxes.

- Practical notes for data governance and reuse
  - Clear metadata and documentation available to support discoverability and reuse.
  - The dataset serves as a core data product with links to related studies and manuscripts; possible co-ownership and cross-referencing with other datasets and outputs.
  - Users should account for data gaps and quality limitations when analyzing fluxes or comparing campaigns.
