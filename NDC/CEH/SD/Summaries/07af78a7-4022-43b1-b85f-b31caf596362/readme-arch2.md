# Code for generating equilibrium genotype frequency values, and checking the analytical relatedness expression with simulation

## Overview
- Supplementary code associated with the Evolution Letters 2023 paper “Is cooperation favoured by horizontal gene transfer?”
- Provides Matlab-based tools to generate equilibrium genotype frequency values and to validate the analytical relatedness expression using simulated data.

## Contents and usage
- Script_to_generate_equilibrium_genotype_frequencies.m: generates equilibrium genotype frequency values.
- Comparison_of_simulated_and_expected_relatedness.m: tests the relatedness expression against simulated data.
- Implemented in Matlab R2022a.

## Reproducibility and accessibility
- All code used to reproduce the paper’s analyses is included in the repository.
- Matlab compatibility specified (R2022a) to ensure consistent execution.

## Relevance to environmental analytics
- Illustrates a standardized, testable workflow for generating model outputs and validating them against simulations, supporting transparent, reproducible analyses.
- Emphasizes verification of analytical expressions via simulation, aligning with data integrity and method scrutiny principles relevant to environmental monitoring workflows.
