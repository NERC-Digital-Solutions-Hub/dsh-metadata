# Code for generating equilibrium genotype frequency values, and checking the analytical relatedness expression with simulation

- What it is: A Matlab-based code repository containing all code for the Evolution Letters 2023 paper “Is cooperation favoured by horizontal gene transfer?” and supplementary materials.

- Purpose: To reproduce and validate key results by generating equilibrium genotype frequency values and testing the analytical relatedness expression against simulated data.

- Software and files:
  - Matlab R2022a is the target environment.
  - Script_to_generate_equilibrium_genotype_frequencies.m: generates equilibrium genotype frequency values.
  - Comparison_of_simulated_and_expected_relatedness.m: tests the relatedness expression using simulated data.

- How it supports data work:
  - Provides ready-made data-generation scripts to produce reproducible datasets for equilibrium frequencies.
  - Offers a validation workflow by comparing analytical expectations with simulations, aiding transparency and replication.
  - Serves as a practical data product for researchers exploring genetic compatibility, cooperation, or horizontal gene transfer in related models.

- Relevance for Data Support:
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data processing—from data generation to validation—fitting a data-support role that produces usable analytical tools and verified outputs for downstream users.
