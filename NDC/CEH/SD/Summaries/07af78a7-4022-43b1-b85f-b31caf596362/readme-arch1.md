# Code for generating equilibrium genotype frequency values, and checking the analytical relatedness expression with simulation

- Purpose
  - Supplementary code for the Evolution Letters 2023 paper “Is cooperation favoured by horizontal gene transfer?”
  - Enables generation of equilibrium genotype frequency values and testing of the analytical relatedness expression via simulated data.

- Software and context
  - Code written for Matlab R2022a.
  - Reproduces analyses from the referenced paper and supports validation of theoretical results.

- Included scripts
  - Script_to_generate_equilibrium_genotype_frequencies.m — generates equilibrium genotype frequency values.
  - Comparison_of_simulated_and_expected_relatedness.m — tests the relatedness expression by comparing simulated data to theoretical expectations.

- How to use
  - Run the two scripts in Matlab R2022a to reproduce the equilibrium frequencies and to validate the relatedness expression against simulations.

- Relevance for analysts
  - Provides reproducible, data-driven methods to quantify genotype frequencies and to assess model-derived relatedness, useful for investigating cooperation and horizontal gene transfer.
  - Useful as a starting point for adapting analyses to alternative datasets or parameter settings to explore robustness.
