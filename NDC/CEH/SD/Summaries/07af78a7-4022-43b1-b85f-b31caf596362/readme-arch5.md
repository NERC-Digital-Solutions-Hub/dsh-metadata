# Code for generating equilibrium genotype frequency values, and checking the analytical relatedness expression with simulation

## Overview
- Supplementary code associated with the Evolution Letters 2023 paper “Is cooperation favoured by horizontal gene transfer?”
- MATLAB R2022a code intended to support reproducibility of the analyses and results.

## Repository contents
- Script_to_generate_equilibrium_genotype_frequencies.m: generates equilibrium genotype frequency values.
- Comparison_of_simulated_and_expected_relatedness.m: tests the analytical relatedness expression against simulated data.

## Technical context
- Code is written for MATLAB R2022a.
- Provides two core workflows: generating equilibrium genotype frequencies and validating the relatedness expression using simulations.

## Use and reuse
- Designed to enable other researchers to reproduce and validate the paper’s analyses as supplementary material.

## Provenance and governance notes (Data Steward perspective)
- Tied to a specific publication (Scott, West, Dewar and Wild; Evolution Letters, 2023); edition compatibility with MATLAB version is relevant for long-term discoverability and reuse.
