# Is cooperation favoured by horizontal gene transfer?

- Overview
  - Supplementary code repository for the Evolution Letters 2023 paper "Is cooperation favoured by horizontal gene transfer?"
  - Contains all code associated with the paper.

- Implementation details
  - Language/environment: MATLAB (R2022a).
  - Main components:
    - Script_to_generate_equilibrium_genotype_frequencies.m: generates equilibrium genotype frequency values.
    - Comparison_of_simulated_and_expected_relatedness.m: tests the analytical relatedness expression using simulated data.

- Purpose and use
  - Facilitates reproduction of the paper’s computational analyses.
  - Provides concrete tools to generate key genotype frequency outputs and validate relatedness calculations against simulations.

- Reproducibility and transparency
  - Centralized supplementary code to enable verification of methods and results.
  - Clear targeting of specific analytical steps (equilibrium frequencies and relatedness validation).
