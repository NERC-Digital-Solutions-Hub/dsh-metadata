# Evaluating the Options for Combining Economically, Socially and Ecologically Sustainable Agriculture

## Aims and scope
- Integrate sociology, agricultural science, economics, and ecology to explain and predict how economic, environmental, technological, regulatory, and social changes affect farming practices, livelihoods, and biodiversity.
- Study 48 arable farms across three UK counties to understand farmer decision-making, weed dynamics, and bird populations.
- Develop predictive, multi-scale models that connect farmer objectives with ecological outcomes (weeds, birds, and four mammal species) to evaluate policy options and farm-management choices.

## Data and field methods
- Weed data collection across large spatial scales: density-structured states (zero, low, medium, high, very high) for seven weed species in 500 fields over three years, using 20x20 m quadrats.
- Field mapping of habitat features (hedges, ditches, trees) to link weed dynamics with bird models.
- Three annual censuses per field (spring, summer, autumn) to capture weed dynamics in different crop contexts (grass crops, oilseed rape, sugar beet, etc.).
- Spatial coverage: 48 farms (Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk) with varying soil types, management practices, and farm sizes.
- Bird data: abundance models using 1 km2 Breeding Bird Survey squares (880 squares) and supplementary boundary, cropping, and landscape data; both field-scale habitat-use models and landscape-scale habitat heterogeneity analyses.

## Modelling and analysis
- Density-state modelling to estimate field- and farm-scale weed densities; correction for misclassification bias and conversion to population size metrics.
- Linear mixed models to relate field-mean weed densities to previous weed presence, herbicide usage, and farmer preferences.
- Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to elicit farmer objectives and translate them into inputs for a Silsoe Whole Farm Model (SFARMMOD) extended to multi-objective optimization.
- Bird models linking abundance to landscape, boundary structure, and cropping; comparison of landscape-scale and field-scale models; multi-model inference for habitat variables.
- Integration framework: prototype predictive models for birds under scenarios (e.g., biofuel price changes) extended to incorporate stated farmer preferences; social data parameterize management decisions.
- Whole Farm Modelling (SFARMMOD): a profit-maximizing linear program extended to accommodate conservation decisions, non-production activities, and non-profit goals using Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) for value-based preferences; includes non-cropped land uses as scenario variables and handles non-convexities with mixed-integer programming.

## Integrated and cross-scale analyses
- Integrated socio-ecological modelling to predict farm-level decisions and landscape outcomes, then scale up to landscape-scale biodiversity implications.
- Found that profit-maximization alone poorly describes real farming practices; including risk, conservation preferences, and management complexity improves predictive power.
- Integrated outputs demonstrate how economic policy levers (e.g., set-aside rules, stubble requirements) interact with farmer preferences to affect weed densities and bird populations.
- Demonstrated the potential of combining weed, bird, and socio-economic models to forecast ecosystem responses to policy changes (e.g., removal of mandatory set-aside, subsidy adjustments).

## Interdisciplinarity and stakeholder engagement
- Employed a cross-disciplinary team (ecology, economics, sociology) and regular project meetings to ensure alignment across scales.
- Stakeholder analysis tool developed to map interest and influence of groups (farmers, government, NGOs, industry) on arable land management; highlighted potential conflicts between habitat/information and production interests.
- Inclusion of social scientists in field design and interviews to better capture farmer motivations and translate them into predictive model inputs.

## Key findings
- Weed dynamics: weed abundance varies widely between fields and crops; herbicide application reduces some weed densities but effects are highly variable due to background densities, efficacy differences, resistance, and social/economic factors.
- Crop type and landscape: crop type strongly influences weed densities, but landscape context (soil, climate, boundary features) also shapes weed and bird outcomes; within-field processes differ from between-field and landscape-level patterns.
- Birds: non-crop landscape features (boundary structure, hedges, ditches, surrounding habitat) generally explain more variation in bird abundance than cropping alone; habitat heterogeneity effects vary by spatial scale and species.
- Policy-relevant insights: introducing/altering arable interventions (e.g., overwintered stubbles, skylark plots) has differential costs and effectiveness depending on soil, rainfall, and cropping system; simple subsidies may be insufficient to trigger desired management changes without addressing farmer risk and management complexity.
- Integrated modelling: models that incorporate farmer preferences (risk, number of crops, conservation values) predict agricultural landscapes and biodiversity outcomes more accurately than profit-only models; high-income-focused farmers may achieve low weed densities via heavy herbicide use, which may not align with biodiversity goals.

## Policy implications and outputs
- Integrated framework enables evaluating how policy options (e.g., removing set-aside, changing stubble requirements) affect bird populations and weed dynamics, accounting for farmer decision-making.
- Demonstrates the necessity of incorporating non-market farmer objectives and risk attitudes into land-use planning to predict adoption and ecological outcomes.
- Results inform potential policy design, including compensation levels for environmental practices, and the design of agri-environment schemes that align farmer incentives with biodiversity goals.
- Provided a quantitative basis for trade-offs between profit, biodiversity, and management complexity (e.g., Pareto-optimal stubble areas vs. profit under different soils and rainfall regimes).

## Outputs, data, and knowledge transfer
- Datasets: (1) farmer background and decision-making data; (2) farm-level activity data for model parameterization; (3) crop-management data for weed mapping. Weed data encompass about 2 million observations, across 500 fields/48 farms over three years for seven weed species.
- Publications and tools: development of a taxonomy and methods for integrating socio-economics with ecology; stakeholder analysis tool; multi-model inference approaches; MAUT-based farm optimization framework; policy-analysis visualizations (e.g., trade-off figures for stubble and crop composition).
- Data accessibility: plans for archiving, with sensitivity noted for farm-identifying information in some datasets.

## Impacts and potential applications
- Improves understanding of how farmer decisions shape biodiversity and how policies may be designed to align economic viability with ecological goals.
- Provides a replicable modelling framework for integrating economic, social, and ecological data to predict outcomes under different policy and market scenarios.
- Supports policy discussions on biodiversity targets, adoption of conservation practices, and the role of agri-environment schemes in sustainable agriculture.
- Demonstrates the value of cross-disciplinary data collection and modelling for informing practical management at farm and landscape scales.
