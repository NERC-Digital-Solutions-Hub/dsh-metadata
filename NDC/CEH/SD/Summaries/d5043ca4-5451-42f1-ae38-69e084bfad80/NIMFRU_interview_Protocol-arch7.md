# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

- Purpose: Provide clear, systematic guidelines for collecting translated and transcribed semi-structured interviews, resulting in one English transcript per interviewee and one Flood Impact Matrix (CSV) per interviewee. The data support GIS-based analysis and map-ready data products for flood impact understanding.

## Outputs and data structure
- English transcript for each interviewee (RTF/Word document).
- One completed Flood Impact Matrix CSV per interviewee.
- Interview questions are organized in CSV toolkits:
  - Interview_tool_kit_Data_collection_info.csv
  - Interview_tool_kit_District_Officers.csv
  - Interview_tool_kit_Farmers.csv

## Pre-field day preparation
- Field interview kit includes:
  - Notebook and pens (with spare)
  - Fully charged recording device with sufficient storage
  - Hard copies of participant information sheets
  - Hard copies of Farmers and District Officers interview questions
  - Flood Impact Matrix hard copies (for all planned interviewees + 2 spares)
  - An anonymised number spreadsheet for participant numbering
  - Clipboards and a file for completed questionnaires

## Covid-19 safety
- Follow ECOTRUST Covid-19 standard operating procedures.
- Prioritise health and safety; stop if you feel at risk; contact designated person if concerns arise.

## Ethics, consent, and introduction
- Begin with group introduction and ethics overview:
  - Project purpose and what will happen today
  - What is expected from interviewees (input, duration, recording)
  - Confidentiality and withdrawal options
  - Where to obtain further information
  - Verbal consent for any possible photographs
- Ensure consent and comprehension before starting each interview.

## Interview scope and sampling
- Farmer interviews: 16 individuals total
  - 8 farmers with prior participation in listening groups/FAMVACs/IHM/HEA baseline (4 male, 4 female)
  - 8 farmers without such participation (4 male, 4 female)
- All interviews are individual (not group responses) and each interviewee completes a Flood Impact Matrix.

## Practical interview conditions
- Conduct interviews in private, quiet spaces; minimize wind/noise and ensure comfort.
- Manage time (aim to adhere to allocated duration).
- Regularly confirm the recording device is capturing.
- Start each recording with the interviewee’s full name and allocated anonymous number for proper filing.

## Using the interview tools
- Interviewer notes: capture interesting points, interruptions, disturbances, and observations; label notes with interviewee name and date.
- Farmer–District Officer interviews must be audio recorded; ensure files are saved centrally and labeled.
- Use prompts to elicit detailed responses (not just yes/no answers); probe on topics like gender, difficulties, and adaptation strategies.
- Flood Impact Matrix: administered orally with interviewee; not audio recorded; interviewer assists to ensure understanding and completion.

## File management and organization
- Audio file naming convention: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118).
- Each interview transcribed into a separate Word document and uploaded to teamwork.
- Transcript header should include:
  - Date of interview
  - Location
  - Interviewer name
  - Interviewee name
  - Interviewee sex
  - Interviewee anon number
  - Interview length

## Transcription guidelines
- Each speaker starts a new line with the speaker’s name.
- Transcribe exactly what was spoken; do not paraphrase or correct grammar.
- Translate/transcribe into proper English; use correct capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.
- Do not add information (e.g., job titles, page numbers) within the transcript; keep additions separate.
- Clean up non-verbatim elements (remove fillers like um/er where appropriate) but retain meaningful discourse.
- Indicate interruptions or sound events in transcripts when relevant.
- If a speaker trails off, indicate with ellipses (...); do not restructure thoughts or alter meaning.
- Do not omit or alter spoken words; do not insert off-topic content.
