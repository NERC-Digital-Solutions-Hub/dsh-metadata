# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

## Overview and Outputs
- Purpose: provide clear guidelines to ensure data collected is relevant, systematic, and managed for analysis.
- Outputs per interview: one English transcript (RTF) and one completed Flood Impact Matrix CSV per interviewee.
- Data products: audio recordings, translated/transcribed English transcripts, and structured Flood Impact Matrix data.

## Materials and Outputs
- Interview materials: translated and transcribed semi-structured interviews; accompanying Flood Impact Matrix.
- Source files: 
  - Interview questions for District Officers and Farmers (CSV)
  - Flood Impact Matrix (CSV per interviewee)

## Pre-field Day Kit
- Notebook, pens (5 spares)
- Fully charged recording device with sufficient storage
- Hard copies of participant information sheets
- Hard copies of interviewer-specific questions (Farmers and District Officers)
- Flood Impact Matrix hard copies (enough for all interviewees + 2 spares)
- Anonymity number spreadsheet (for consistent ID across interviews)
- Clipboards and a file to organize completed questionnaires

## Covid-19 Rules
- Follow ECOTRUST Covid-19 SOPs
- Prioritize health and safety; pause or stop data collection if unsafe
- Contact relevante: Jonah for concerns

## Group Introduction and Ethics Overview
- Begin with project introduction, purpose, expected participant input, duration, and recording details
- Explain confidentiality and withdrawal rights
- Provide information sheets and show where to access further information
- Obtain verbal consent for possible photography

## Interview Design and Sampling
- Farmer interviews: 16 individuals total
  - 8 farmers with prior participation (listening groups, FAMVACs, or IHM/HEA baseline)
  - 8 farmers without such participation
  - Balanced by gender: 4 males and 4 females in each subgroup
- Each interview is individual (not group responses)

## Practicalities
- Conduct interviews in private, quiet locations to ensure candid responses
- Aim for interviews to fit within allocated time (approximate one hour)
- Regularly verify that recording is active
- Start each recording with the interviewee’s full name and allocated anonymous number for accurate filing

## Using the Tool Effectively
- Interviewer to take notes on notable remarks, interruptions, and observations; label notes with interviewee name and date
- Audio-record farmer district officer interviews; ensure recordings are saved centrally and labeled
- Use open-ended prompts to encourage detailed responses (e.g., “could you tell me about X?”)
- Flood Impact Matrix: completed with interviewee; not audio-recorded
  - Interviewer guides and supports the interviewee to complete the matrix accurately

## File Management
- Audio file naming: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118)
- Each interview transcribed into a separate Word document; upload to teamwork
- Transcripts contain a header with:
  - Date of interview
  - Location
  - Interviewer name
  - Interviewee name
  - Interviewee sex
  - Interviewee anonymous number
  - Interview length

## Transcribing Guidelines
- Each speaker starts a new line with the speaker’s name
- Accuracy: transcribe exactly what is spoken; do not omit or paraphrase
- Language: translations into English; proper capitalization, punctuation, spelling
- Do Not Paraphrase or Edit grammar; do not add off-topic content
- Do Not Add Information: avoid page or job numbers or extra comments in the transcript
- Clean Up non-verbatim elements: remove fillers (um, er, etc.) and stutters
- Note interruptions or sound events within the transcript
- If a speaker trails off, indicate with ellipses (...)
- The Flood Impact Matrix is not audio recorded; it is administered orally and completed with the interviewee’s input

## Transcription Header Details (example to include at start of each transcript)
- Date of interview
- Location of interview
- Interviewer name
- Interviewee name
- Interviewee sex
- Interviewee anon number
- Interview length

## Additional Notes
- Pre-field reading of the provided interview toolkits and questions is required
- Regularly reference the ethics and consent information throughout the data collection process
- Ensure that data management practices connect transcripts with corresponding Flood Impact Matrix entries for integrated analysis
