# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

## Purpose and Scope
- Provides clear guidelines to ensure data collected from case study interviews is relevant, systematic, and methodically managed.
- Supports collection of translated and transcribed semi-structured interviews (one English transcript per interviewee) and completion of a Flood Impact Matrix per interviewee.

## Data Collection Tools
- Interview questions available in:
  - Additional 'how to' instructions: Interview_tool_kit_Data_collection_info.csv
  - Interview questions for District Officers: Interview_tool_kit_District_Officers.csv
  - Interview questions for Farmers: Interview_tool_kit_Farmers.csv
- Each interviewee completes a Flood Impact Matrix, resulting in one completed CSV per interviewee.

## Pre-field Day Kit
- Notebook, five spare pens
- Fully charged recording device with sufficient storage
- Hard copies of participant information sheets for all planned interviewees
- Hard copies of Farmers and District Officers interview questions
- Flood Impact Matrix copies for all interviewees (plus two spares)
- Anon number spreadsheet to assign unique numbers to interviewees
- Clipboards and a file for organizing completed questionnaires

## Health and Safety
- Adheres to Ecotrust Covid-19 standard operating procedures
- Safety prioritized; pause data collection if there are health concerns; contact Jonah for concerns

## Ethics and Consent
- Group Introduction and Ethics Overview includes:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - What is expected from interviewees (input, duration, recording)
  - Confidentiality and withdrawal options
  - Where to obtain further information
  - Verbal consent for potential photography

## Conducting the Interviews
- Sampling: 16 farmers total
  - 8 farmers who participated in listening groups, FAMVACs, or IHM/HEA baseline (4 male, 4 female)
  - 8 farmers who did not participate in those activities (4 male, 4 female)
- All interviews are individual (not group-based) and each participant completes the Flood Impact Matrix

## Practicalities
- Interview location should ensure privacy and minimize noise (no eavesdropping; stable environment)
- Try to keep interviews to the allocated time (about one hour)
- Regularly verify recording is active
- Start each recording with the interviewee’s full name and assigned anonymous number

## Using the Tool Effectively
- Interviewers take notes on key points, disturbances, and observations; label notes with interviewee name and date
- All farmer and district officer interviews must be audio recorded; ensure files are saved centrally and labeled
- Use open-ended prompts to explore gender, difficulties, adaptation strategies, etc.
- Flood Impact Matrix is administered orally and not audio recorded; interviewer supports completion to ensure understanding

## File Management and Transcription
- Audio file naming format: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118)
- Each interview transcribed into a separate Word document and uploaded to teamwork
- Transcription metadata at start of each file:
  - Date, location, interviewer name, interviewee name, interviewee sex, anon number, interview length

## Transcribing Guidelines
- Start each speaker on a new line with the speaker’s name
- Transcribe verbatim; do not paraphrase or correct grammar
- Use proper English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling; no phonetic spellings
- Do not add information or editorial comments; light cleanup of non-verbatim fills (e.g., um, er)
- Indicate interruptions and sound events; use ellipses for trails off
- If a speaker trails off, mark accordingly with ellipses; maintain the original thought as spoken
