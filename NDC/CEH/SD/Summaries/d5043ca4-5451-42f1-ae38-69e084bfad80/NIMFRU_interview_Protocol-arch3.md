# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

- Purpose and outputs
  - Provides clear guidelines to ensure data collected from case study interviews is relevant, systematic, and well-managed.
  - Outputs include one English transcript (rtf) per interviewee and one completed Flood Impact Matrix CSV per interviewee.
  - Interview questions are organized in accompanying CSV tools:
    - Interview_tool_kit_Data_collection_info.csv
    - Interview_tool_kit_District_Officers.csv
    - Interview_tool_kit_Farmers.csv

- Pre-field day preparation
  - Required items for each interviewee:
    - Notebook and five spare pens
    - Fully charged recording device with sufficient storage
    - Hard copies of participant information sheets
    - Hard copies of interview questions for Farmers and District Officers
    - Flood Impact Matrix copies (enough for all interviewees plus 2 spares)
    - Anon number spreadsheet to allocate interviewee numbers
    - Clipboards and a filing system for completed questionnaires
  - Covid-19 precautions: ECOTRUST SOPs in place; follow procedures; prioritize health and safety; stop if at risk and contact Jonah.

- Ethical considerations and consent
  - Group introduction covers:
    - Project purpose, what is being done, expected input, duration, recording, confidentiality, withdrawal options, where to obtain more information, and verbal consent for possible photography.

- Interview design and sampling
  - Farmer interviews conducted with 16 community members:
    - 8 farmers who participated in listening groups, FAMVACs, or IHM/HEA baseline assessments (4 male, 4 female)
    - 8 farmers who did not participate in the above activities (4 male, 4 female)
  - All interviewees complete the Flood Impact Matrix.
  - Interviews are individual; no group responses.

- Practicalities during interviews
  - Location: interviewee alone and away from others to ensure privacy; a quiet environment with minimal wind/noise.
  - Time management: aim to stick to allocated interview duration.
  - Recording: regularly confirm the device is recording and that audio files are saved; start each interview by stating interviewee’s full name and anon number.

- Conducting and using the tool
  - Interviewers should note interesting points, interruptions, disturbances, and observations; label notes with interviewee name and date.
  - Farmer and District Officer interviews must be audio recorded; regularly check recording status and ensure files are labeled and stored centrally.
  - Ask all listed questions and allow thorough responses; use prompts to elicit detailed information on topics such as gender, difficulties, and adaptation strategies.
  - Flood Impact Matrix: not audio recorded; interviewer guides the interviewee through the questions and completes the matrix with the interviewee’s input.

- File management and transcription
  - Audio files: named as "Anon number, interviewee name, location, date of interview" (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118).
  - Transcripts: each interview saved as a separate Word document and uploaded to teamwork.
  - Transcript metadata to include at the start:
    - Date of interview, Location, Interviewer name, Interviewee name, Interviewee sex, Interviewee anon number, Interview length.
  - Transcription guidelines:
    - Each speaker starts a new line with their name.
    - Verbatim accuracy: transcribe exactly what was spoken; do not paraphrase or correct grammar.
    - Language: transcripts must be translated and transcribed into English with proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.
    - Do not add information (e.g., job numbers, titles) in the transcript; any such data can be added in separate fields.
    - Clean up non-verbatim fillers (e.g., um, er) but do not alter meaning.
    - Indicate interruptions and sound events in the transcript where applicable.
    - If a thought trails off, use ellipses.
  - Data handling: ensure audio files and transcripts are stored consistently and accessible to the team through teamwork.
