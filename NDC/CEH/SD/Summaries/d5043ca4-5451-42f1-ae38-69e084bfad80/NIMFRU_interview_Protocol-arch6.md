# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

- Purpose: Aimed at guiding the systematic collection of translated and transcribed semi-structured interviews, producing one English transcript per interviewee. Each interviewee also completes a Flood Impact Matrix, yielding one completed CSV per interviewee.
- Scope: Includes interview questions for District Officers and Farmers, plus accompanying data tools and handling instructions.

## Before fieldwork

- Prepare over all fieldwork materials:
  - Notebooks, multiple pens, recording device with ample storage
  - Hard copies of participant information sheets, interview questions, and Flood Impact Matrix
  - Anonymous numbering system (anon numbers) and clipboards
  - A filing system for completed questionnaires
- Covid-19 safety: Follow ECOTRUST Covid-19 SOPs; prioritize health and safety; halt if unsafe; contact designated safety lead (Jonah) with concerns.

## Group Introduction and Ethics Overview

- At the start, introduce the project and explain:
  - What will happen, why it is being done
  - What is expected from interviewees (input, duration, recording)
  - Confidentiality and withdrawal options
  - How to obtain further information (info sheets)
  - Verbal consent for potential photography

## Conducting the interviews

- Interviewee selection (for Farmers):

  - Total of 16 community farmers:
    - 8 who have previously participated in listening groups, FAMVACs, or IHM/HEA baseline (4 male, 4 female)
    - 8 who have not participated in those activities (4 male, 4 female)
  - Each interviewee completes the Flood Impact Matrix
  - Interviews are individual; not group responses

### 4.1 Practicalities

- Ensure privacy: interviewee is alone and away from others to enable free speaking
- Environment: quiet, sheltered from wind/noise; comfortable for interviewer and interviewee; stable writing surface
- Time management: aim to stick to allocated interview duration
- Recording checks: regularly confirm recording is active
- Identity and anonymity: state full name and anon number at the start of every recording

### 4.2 Using the tool effectively

- Ongoing data capture:
  - Interviewers take notes on key points, interruptions, disturbances, and observations; label notes with interviewee name and date
  - Farmer and district officer interviews must be audio recorded; ensure recordings are saved centrally and labeled
  - Allow and encourage probing beyond yes/no answers (e.g., “could you tell me about X?”, “please explain Y”, “why do you think this?”)
- Flood Impact Matrix:
  - Not audio recorded; interviewee completes it with the interviewer’s guidance
  - Ideally, the interviewee completes the matrix themselves, with active support to ensure understanding

## Flood Impact Matrix (data capture companion)

- Applied during each interview and completed collaboratively with the interviewee
- Ensures structured capture of perceived flood impacts alongside interview responses
- Outputs a completed CSV per interviewee

## File management and transcription

### 5.1 File management

- Audio file naming: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118)
- Transcripts: one Word document per interview; stored electronically and uploaded to teamwork
- Transcript metadata at start:
  - Date of interview
  - Location
  - Interviewer name
  - Interviewee name
  - Interviewee sex
  - Interviewee anon number
  - Interview length

### 5.2 Transcribing guidelines

- Formatting:
  - Each speaker starts a new line with the speaker name
- Accuracy and language:
  - Transcribe exactly what is spoken; do not paraphrase or correct grammar
  - Translate to English if needed; use proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling
  - Do not add non-spoken information (no page numbers, job numbers, titles, or comments)
- Editing and clarity:
  - Lightly edit non-verbatim fillers (e.g., um, er, stutters) for readability
  - Indicate interruptions or sound events within transcripts when relevant
  - If a speaker trails off, use ellipses to indicate unfinished thoughts
- Integrity:
  - Do not remove or rearrange content; preserve original words
  - Do not include information not spoken; keep transcript faithful to audio
- Output requirements:
  - Transcripts are English, verbatim where spoken, and organized for easy matching with audio
  - Ensure alignment with the corresponding Flood Impact Matrix and filed under the correct anon number
