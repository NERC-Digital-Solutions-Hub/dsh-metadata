# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

- Purpose: A comprehensive guide to collect translated and transcribed semi-structured interviews, producing one English transcript per interviewee (RTF) and one completed Flood Impact Matrix per interviewee.
- Related tools: Interview questions and data collection materials referenced in accompanying files (Interview_tool_kit_Data_collection_info.csv, Interview_tool_kit_District_Officers.csv, Interview_tool_kit_Farmers.csv).

## 1. Pre-field day kit checklist for each interviewee
- Notebook and five spare pens
- Fully charged recording device with sufficient storage
- Hard copies of participant information sheets for all planned interviewees
- Hard copies of Farmer and District Officer interview questions
- Flood Impact Matrix sheets (enough for all interviewees plus 2 spares)
- Anon number spreadsheet to allocate interviewees anonymized numbers
- Clipboards and a filing system for completed questionnaires

## 2. Covid-19 rules
- Follow ECOTRUST Covid-19 SOPs; prioritise health and safety
- Do not proceed if you feel unsafe; discuss concerns with Jonah

## 3. Group Introduction and Ethics Overview
- Introduce the project, purpose of the day, interview expectations, duration, and that interviews will be recorded
- Explain confidentiality, withdrawal rights, where to obtain more information
- Obtain verbal consent for potential photographs

## 4. Conducting the interviews
- Farmer sample: 16 community members
  - 8 farmers previously involved in listening groups, FAMVACs, or IHM/HEA baseline (4 male, 4 female)
  - 8 farmers not previously involved (4 male, 4 female)
- Interviews are individual (not group) and each interviewee completes the Flood Impact Matrix

### 4.1 Practicalities
- Ensure interviewee privacy and a quiet environment; prefer setting with minimal wind/noise
- Manage time to keep within allocated duration
- Regularly verify that recording is ongoing
- Start each recording by stating the interviewee’s full name and anonymized number

### 4.2 Using the tool effectively
- Interviewers should take notes on key points, interruptions, and observations; label notes with interviewee name and date
- Audio-record Farmer District Officer interviews; ensure files are saved centrally with proper labeling
- Ask all listed questions and allow thorough responses; actively probe on topics like gender, challenges, and adaptation strategies
- Do not limit answers to yes/no; use prompts to elicit detailed information

## 5.1 Flood Impact Matrix and file management
- Flood Impact Matrix is administered orally with the interviewee; not audio recorded
- Interviewer completes the matrix with the interviewee’s input

### File naming and transcription workflow
- Audio file naming convention: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118)
- Each interview transcribed into a separate Word document and uploaded to teamwork
- Transcripts start with a metadata header including:
  - Date of interview
  - Location
  - Interviewer name
  - Interviewee name
  - Interviewee sex
  - Interviewee anon number
  - Interview length

## 5.2 Transcribing guidelines
- Each speaker begins a new line with the speaker’s name
- Transcribe verbatim; do not paraphrase or correct grammar
- Translate to English; maintain proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling
- Do not add information (no page numbers, job numbers, titles, or comments)
- Lightly clean non-verbatim segments (remove fillers like um, er, etc.)
- Note any sound events or interruptions in the transcript
- If a speaker trails off, use ellipses to indicate unfinished thoughts
- Do not cut words or rearrange spoken content; type exactly what was spoken
