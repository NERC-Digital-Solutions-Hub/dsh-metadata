# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

- Purpose: Provide clear, methodical guidelines to ensure data collected from case study interviews is relevant, systematic, and well-managed. The process covers translated and transcribed semi-structured interviews (one English transcript per interviewee) and the completion of a Flood Impact Matrix per interviewee.

- Outputs: One completed rtf transcript per interviewee and one completed CSV Flood Impact Matrix per interviewee.

## Pre field day kit

- Notebook and multiple pens (5 spare)
- Fully charged recording device with sufficient storage
- Hard copies of participant information sheets for all planned interviewees
- Hard copies of Farmer and District Officer interview questions (one copy per interviewer)
- Hard copies of Flood Impact Matrix (enough for all interviewees plus 2 spares)
- An anonymized number spreadsheet to allocate numbers to interviewees
- Clipboards and a file system to organize completed questionnaires

- Data stewardship focus: ensure traceable, organized data collection with proper consent documentation and anonymization from the outset.

## Covid-19 rules

- Follow Ecotrust Covid-19 standard operating procedures; prioritize health and safety.
- If you feel unsafe, do not continue; health and safety come first.
- Report concerns to Jonah.

- Data stewardship focus: maintain safe, compliant data collection environments; document safety considerations for data collectors and participants.

## Group Introduction and Ethics Overview

- Provide project introduction, purpose of the day, expected interview commitment, and recording details.
- Explain confidentiality, withdrawal options, and where to obtain further information (information sheets).
- Obtain verbal consent; inform about potential photographs.

- Data stewardship focus: ensure informed consent, transparency, and clear data use intentions.

## Conducting the interviews

- Sampling plan: 16 farmers total.
  - 8 farmers who have participated in listening groups, FAMVACs, or IHM/HEA baseline assessments (balanced by sex: 4 males, 4 females).
  - 8 farmers who have not participated in the above activities (4 males, 4 females).
- All selected interviewees must complete the Flood Impact Matrix individually (not as a group).

- Data stewardship focus: representative, balanced sampling; individual responses; consistent data collection across interviewees.

### 4.1 Practicalities

- Conduct interviews in private, quiet locations to ensure free expression; minimize wind/noise and ensure a comfortable writing surface.
- Manage time effectively; aim to adhere to the allocated interview duration.
- Regularly verify recording is ongoing; explain and perform occasional checks.
- State each interviewee’s full name and anonymized number at the start of every recording.

- Data stewardship focus: high-quality, auditable data capture with clear linkage between audio and transcript identifiers.

### 4.2 Using the tool effectively

- Throughout interviews, note important points, interruptions, disturbances, and observations; label notes with interviewee name and date.
- The farmer and district officer interviews must be audio recorded; ensure files are saved centrally and labeled after each day.
- Ask all listed questions, but also probe for deeper insights (gender, difficulties, adaptation strategies, etc.). Ensure responses are thorough; avoid yes/no brevity.
- Use prompts to elicit detail (e.g., “could you tell me about X?”, “please explain Y”).
- Flood Impact Matrix is not audio recorded; interviewees complete it with the interviewer’s support, explaining questions as needed; ideally the interviewee completes it independently.

- Data stewardship focus: rigorous, interview-driven data collection with comprehensive, qualitative depth and non-audio documentation where appropriate.

## File management and transcription

### 5.1 File management

- Audio file naming convention: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118).
- Each interview is transcribed into a separate Word document, saved electronically, and uploaded to the Teamwork platform.
- Transcripts must include at the start:
  - Date of interview
  - Location
  - Interviewer name
  - Interviewee name
  - Interviewee sex
  - Interviewee anon number
  - Interview length

- Data stewardship focus: precise, consistent, and traceable file naming and metadata for easy data governance and discovery.

### 5.2 Transcribing guidelines

- Each speaker starts a new line with the speaker’s name.
- Accuracy: type exactly what is spoken; do not omit unclear phrases.
- Language: transcripts should be translated to English with proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling; no phonetic spellings or netspeak.
- Do not paraphrase or correct grammar; do not add information not spoken.
- Do not add extraneous information (e.g., page numbers, job titles) in the transcript; these can be added in separate fields later.
- Clean up non-verbatim parts (remove filler words like um/er, stutters) as non-verbatim edits.
- Note sound events that interrupt dialogue in the transcript.
- If a speaker trails off, indicate with ellipses (...).
- Ensure accuracy even when speakers are interrupted or cut off.

- Data stewardship focus: high-fidelity transcription with clear audit trail, consistent formatting, and careful handling of language translation.

- The protocol emphasizes end-to-end data governance: consent, privacy, careful data capture, structured storage, consistent metadata, and rigorous transcription practices to support reliable secondary use and discovery by researchers and data users.
