# Rationale

- Contamination of waterbodies with fecal indicator organisms (FIOs) from diffuse and point sources poses significant health risks and affects waterbody quality and ecology, particularly for recreational users and in relation to other stressors.
- The dataset examines the spatial distribution of FIOs and their drivers in standing waters across UK Hydroscapes with contrasting landcover: Greater Glasgow (urban), Norfolk (agricultural), and Cumbria (upland/pastoral). Within each Hydroscape, 18 water bodies were selected to cover a gradient of size, productivity, hydrological connectivity, and ecological quality.

## Study areas and contextual information

- Samples were collected in three seasons (spring, summer, autumn) from water bodies in Greater Glasgow, Cumbria, and Norfolk.
- Collections occurred in either 2016 or 2017.

## FIO sampling and analysis

- Sampling occurred 3 hours after sunrise to ensure timing consistency relative to UAV exposure.
- Within each water body, samples were spatially dispersed from three locations separated by ~100 m.
- At each location, three subsamples were collected ~5 m apart, giving nine unique samples per water body per sampling visit.
- A total of 1,278 unique samples were collected across all sites and visits.

## Water sampling and laboratory analysis (E. coli)

- E. coli levels estimated by collecting samples ~30 cm below the surface using sterile 180 ml bottles.
- Samples stored at 4°C and processed within 6 hours.
- Filtration and culturing: three volumes (100 ml, 10 ml, 1 ml) filtered through 0.45 µm membranes, placed on MLGA agar, incubated at 37°C, and counted after 24 hours.
- Results reported as colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml of water.
- In addition to E. coli, total heterotrophs (Hetero) CFU per 100 ml were measured.
