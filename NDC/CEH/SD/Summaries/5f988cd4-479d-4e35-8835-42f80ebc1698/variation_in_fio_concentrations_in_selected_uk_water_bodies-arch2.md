# Rationale

- Purpose and scope
  - Examine the spatial distribution of fecal indicator organisms (FIOs) and their drivers in standing waters across UK Hydroscapes, focusing on three contrasting landcover contexts: Greater Glasgow (urban), Norfolk (agricultural), and Cumbria (upland/pastoral).
  - Within each Hydroscape, 18 water bodies were selected to cover a gradient of size, productivity, hydrological connectivity, and ecological quality.

- Study areas and design
  - Samples collected in three seasons (spring, summer, autumn) during 2016 or 2017.
  - Hydroscapes: Greater Glasgow, Cumbria, Norfolk; within each Hydroscape, 18 water bodies to span varying landscape and ecological conditions.

- FIO sampling and analysis
  - Sampling timed 3 hours after sunrise to maintain consistency with UAV-related survey timing.
  - At each water body: three spatially dispersed locations separated by ~100 m; at each location, nine subsamples (three sub-samples per location at ~5 m intervals) for a total of nine samples per water body per visit.
  - Water depth for sampling: shallow (< 0.5 m); samples collected by wading.
  - Total samples: 1,278 unique samples across all water bodies and visits.

- Water sampling and laboratory methods
  - E. coli estimation: ~30 cm below surface using sterile 180 ml bottles; samples stored at 4°C and processed within 6 hours.
  - Filtration: three volumes (100 ml, 10 ml, 1 ml) filtered through 0.45 µm membranes; filters placed on MLGA agar; incubated at 37°C for 24 hours.
  - Output: colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml water for E. coli.
  - Additional measure: total heterotrophs CFU per 100 ml (Hetero) reported.

- Data structure and variables
  - Appendix provides field name descriptions for the dataset: Hydroscape, Description; season, Description; site, Description; sample, Description; rep, Description; Ecoli, Description; Hetero, Description.
  - Core dataset fields: Hydroscape, season, site, sample, rep, Ecoli, Hetero.

- Relevance to monitoring and data use
  - Aligns with environmental health monitoring aims by providing standardized, comparable data across diverse landscapes.
  - Dataset designed for readability, quality assurance, and potential integration with other data sources to enhance the value of monitoring data and support data sharing.
