# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- Purpose and scope: This manual documents the carbon survey conducted under the p4ges project in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ), Madagascar, focusing on carbon stock quantification in Aboveground Biomass (AGB), Belowground Biomass (BGB), litter, dead wood, and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) across multiple land uses. Data and datasets are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

- Context and aims: Aims to inform payments for global ecosystem services and poverty reduction by mapping and analyzing carbon stocks across CAZ. Uses IPCC (2006) pool definitions and supports broader carbon dynamics studies and policy-oriented outputs.

- Pools and terminology: Carbon pools analyzed follow IPCC definitions (AGB, BGB, litter, dead wood, SOC). Units and key terms (e.g., DBH, WSG, SOC30, SOC100) are defined in the glossary and associated datasets.

- Data stewardship: Field and laboratory data, metadata, samples, and resulting carbon stock figures are stored and curated with traceable lineage. Datasets are archived at EIDC; samples/receipts tracked with laboratory identifiers; data published in project reports and referenced scientific papers.

## Sampling framework and Zones of Interest (ZOI)

- ZOI definition: Four Zones of Interest (ZOI) selected to represent CAZ conditions, based on biophysical criteria (altitude, slope, bioclimate, dry season, soils), deforestation history, and access. ZOIs are Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, and Didy.

- Land use classification (LU): Four LU categories identified for carbon work based on Styger et al. (2007):
  - Closed canopy
  - Tree fallow
  - Shrub fallow
  - Tany maty or degraded land
  A reforestation category was also identified via NGO/local community input.

- Site selection criteria: 
  - Slope < 45 degrees
  - Transects centered within habitat patches to minimize edge effects
  - Each site area ≥ 120 m x 120 m
  - Avoid disturbed or mining areas; avoid transects along streams
  - Minimum 500 m between sites

- Sampling intensity and location:
  - 16 plots per ZOI (4 LU types × 4 replicates)
  - Extra plots in some ZOIs to capture carbon stock variability
  - Totals: ZOI1 Lakato (28 sites), ZOI2 Andasibe (48 sites), ZOI3 Anjahamana (28 sites), ZOI4 Didy (28 sites)
  - Each site corresponds to a land-use type; locations identified via remote sensing and compiled in LU datasets

## Field reconnaissance, sampling design, and data collection

- Field reconnaissance: Multidisciplinary team (Carbon, Hydrology, Biodiversity; sometimes CI) verifies site suitability, indicator species, land-use history, and accessibility.

- Minimal area test: Conducted to determine the representative sampling unit; inventory in 1 m x 1 m quadrats repeated with expanding area until no new species appeared. Resulted in a minimal area of 16 m² for carbon stock quantification.

- Administrative and field forms:
  - Permits, mission orders, and insurance
  - Five data collection forms: site characteristics; inventory (regeneration, standing/dead wood, tree inventory); Braun-Blanquet cover; sapling/litter/root sampling; soil profile
  - Field materials: compass, vertex, decameter, flags; biomass/soil sampling tools; labeled sample bags
  - Data management: labeled samples; precise weighing; photo documentation

- Plot design at plot level:
  - Central design: single plot with a 5 m radius for all C pools (degraded land uses follow the same plot method)

- Biomass and vegetation sampling by LU:
  - Closed canopy and fallows:
    - Four circular subplots within a site
    - Saplings (DBH < 5 cm, H > 1.30 m) sampled in a 2 m radius sub-area
    - Trees 5–10 cm DBH weighed and measured (DBH, height), local names recorded
    - Trees 10–20 cm DBH measured with DBH and height; 20+ cm DBH trees recorded
    - Standing dead wood: DBH, height, and top diameter recorded; wood density categorized (Sound, Intermediate, Rotten)
    - Lying dead wood: measured along a 100 m transect; intercept diameters recorded; wood density noted
    - Direct aboveground biomass: 54 trees felled, weighed by components (trunk, branches, leaves); moisture content determined via lab samples
    - Understorey vegetation, litter, and root mat: 1 m x 1 m (understorey) and 25 cm x 25 cm (litter/root mat) quadrats; biomass weighed; samples sent to lab
  - Degraded land (tany maty): no trees beyond 5 cm DBH; biomass, root mat, litter, understorey sampled using the same plot design; soil carbon and root descriptions also collected

- Soil sampling and soil profile:
  - Soil sampling performed at understorey points (1, 2, 3, 4):
    - Auger sampling for soil carbon at depths 0–100 cm (10 cm increments)
    - Cylinder sampling for bulk density at depths 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm
  - Soil profile description in a central pit (1.30 m depth): horizon colors (Munsell), textures/structures, root density, porosity
  - Additional data: GPS coordinates, slope, deforestation history

- Data entry, archiving, and samples management:
  - Field forms scanned, data entered into Excel
  - Photos stored in project space; data series uploaded to EIDC
  - Field-collected samples sent to LRI laboratory; lab numbers linked to field provenance and worksheets created

## Laboratory analyses

- Biomass analysis:
  - Samples air-dried, then oven-dried at 75°C until weight stabilized (approx. 48 hours, longer for large samples)
  - Wooden components and wood-specific gravity (WSG) determined (see Manual n°4)

- Soil analysis:
  - Sample preparation: air-dry, sieve to 2 mm, separate coarse fraction, grind to ~200 µm
  - Moisture content: oven-dry at 105°C for 48 hours
  - Walkley-Black analysis for soil organic carbon (SOC calibration)
  - Mid Infra-Red Spectroscopy (MIRS) for SOC prediction (calibrated against Walkley-Black)
  - Stable isotope analysis (δ13C) on selected samples from different land uses (in Montpellier, LBMP)
  - All soil analyses and data archived at EIDC; detailed soil methods described in Manual n°3

## Data handling, processing, and analysis

- Data workflow: field data and lab data are compiled for carbon stock calculations across all plots and sites

- Aboveground biomass (AGB):
  - Botanical and floristic analyses (Braun-Blanquet, biodiversity metrics)
  - Allometry-based biomass estimation per tree using established equations (e.g., Chave et al. 2005; Vielledent et al. 2012; Chave et al. 2014) or locally derived equations
  - Plot-level AGB (Mg ha-1) obtained by summing tree biomass within the plot and scaling to 1 ha
  - Carbon stock derived from biomass using a factor of 0.5 (C = 0.5 × biomass)

- Litter, understorey, and root biomass:
  - Dry biomass from field samples upscaled to 1 ha
  - Carbon stock calculated using the 0.5 conversion factor

- Dead wood:
  - Lying dead wood: biomass estimated from volume and species-specific density; volume calculated from intercepted diameters along transect
  - Standing dead wood: biomass estimated from volume and density using standard allometric relations
  - Plot-level carbon stocks aggregated from all dead wood pools

- Soil organic carbon (SOC):
  - SOC stocks computed per soil layer using bulk density (BD), carbon concentration, coarse fraction, and layer thickness
  - Equations account for depth (SOC30 and SOC100) and use the equivalent mass method to normalize for density differences among land uses

## Data publication and references

- Outputs: findings published in scientific papers and reports; project team lists key publications on national SOC mapping, SOC variability, and impacts of land-use change on carbon stocks
- Data publication: references include Brown (2002), IPCC guidelines (2003, 2006), Walkley & Black (1947), and regional Madagascar carbon studies
- Data archives: primary data deposited in EIDC; supporting materials linked to field and lab workflows

## Key considerations for analysts

- Data provenance and traceability: meticulous linking of field plots, LU types, site coordinates, lab analyses, and derived carbon stocks
- Scale and representativeness: ZOI-based sampling to capture CAZ variability; minimal area tested to ensure representative stock quantification
- Data standardization: use of standardized LU categories, Braun-Blanquet cover scales, and IPCC-compatible carbon pools and units
- Reproducibility: explicit allometry and calculation methods; documented in referenced manuals and publications
- Accessibility and use: data and metadata are archived with explicit dataset IDs and repository locations (EIDC), enabling discovery and reuse
