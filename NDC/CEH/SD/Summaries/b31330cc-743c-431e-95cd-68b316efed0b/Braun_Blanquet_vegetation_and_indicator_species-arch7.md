    - Type: Numeric.
    - Unit: Percent (%).
  - Indicator_species
    - Description: Indicates whether the inventoried species is a specific indicator of a land use.
    - Type: Binary (Yes/No).
  - B_B_scale
    - Description: Braun-Blanquet scale value.
    - Type: Categorical.
    - Scale mapping:
      - 0 Not present
      - 1 1-5% cover
      - 2 5-25% cover
      - 3 25-50% cover
      - 4 50-75% cover
      - 5 75-95% cover
      - 6 >95% cover

- How to use in GIS
  - Join and map by site_id to geographic units (plots/sites).
  - Use Percent_cover for continuous visualization (e.g., heatmaps or graduated symbols).
  - Use B_B_scale as a categorical map layer to represent Braun-Blanquet classes.
  - Use Life_form to categorize symbols/colors by life form (fern, shrub, herb, etc.).
  - Filter by Indicator_species to focus on species that serve as land-use indicators.
  - Combine with other datasets to analyze spatial patterns of indicator species across sites.

- Considerations and notes for practitioners
  - Data may be sourced from multiple sites and collectors (field materials/resource s = botanist).
  - Consistency in life_form categorization and Braun-Blanquet scale application is important for cross-site comparisons.
  - Acknowledge data provenance and adhere to attribution requirements when using outputs.
