## Data provenance and usage
- Data origin: site-level vegetation surveys aligned with P4GES WP4 site codes.
- Processing approach: data concept implies verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation prior to analysis.
- Purpose: supports monitoring of environmental vegetation condition and its use in assessing land-use indicators.

## Quality, access, and re-use
- Standardised methods and metadata to enable consistent monitoring outputs (e.g., categorising environmental health against standards).
- Outputs typically presented as reports, maps, and charts.
- Emphasis on storing and uploading datasets to appropriate data portals for accessibility.
