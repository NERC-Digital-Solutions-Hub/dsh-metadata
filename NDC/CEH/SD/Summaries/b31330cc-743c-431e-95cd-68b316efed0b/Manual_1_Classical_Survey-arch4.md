# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- Period: April 2014 – June 2015 (update February 2017)
- Purpose: Develop the first step of carbon stock quantification within the CAZ forest ecosystem, focusing on Aboveground Biomass (AGB), Litter, Dead Wood, Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), and Belowground Biomass (BGB) across five IPCC-defined pools.
- Data management focus: describes sampling design, field methods, laboratory analyses, data handling, storage, and publication pathways; datasets archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) and related data centers.

## Context and Goals

- Project aim: Influence the development and implementation of payments for global ecosystem services (carbon) to alleviate poverty in Madagascar.
- Carbon survey scope: CAZ corridor across multiple land uses; classifies carbon pools and provides a basis for carbon quantification throughout the forest, with datasets archived for long-term use.
- Outputs referenced: connections to broader ESPA WP activities (remote sensing, hydrology, biodiversity) and related manuals (e.g., Manual n°3, Manual n°4).

## Zone of Interest (ZOI) and Site Selection

- ZOIs: Four zones representing CAZ diversity
  - ZOI1 Lakato, ZOI2 Andasibe, ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, ZOI4 Didy
- Land uses (LU) identified: Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty/Degraded land, plus reforestation (identified through NGO/community input)
- Site criteria (beyond LU type):
  - Slope < 45 degrees
  - Patches near center to avoid edge effects
  - Each site >= 120 m x 120 m
  - Avoid disturbances and streams; minimum 500 m between sites
- Sampling intensity:
  - 16 plots per ZOI (4 LU x 4 replicates)
  - Additional plots within ZOIs for CAZ carbon stock variability (WP4): 28 sites in ZOI1, 48 in ZOI2, 28 in ZOI3, 28 in ZOI4
- Site identification: Remote sensing followed by field reconnaissance to confirm land use, indicator species, and accessibility
- Minimal area test: Determined 16 m² as the representative sampling area for carbon stock quantification

## Field Reconnaissance and Pre-Field Preparations

- Field reconnaissance: Multidisciplinary teams verify site suitability, land-use type, accessibility, and collect land-use history data
- Administrative setup: Permits, mission orders, and insurance
- Field documents and materials: 
  - Data collection sheets (site characteristics, inventory, coverage, sapling/litter/root sampling, soil profile)
  - Field equipment (forester compass, vertex, flags, cylinders, soil augers, etc.)
  - Sample bags and labeling systems

## Design Sampling and Plot Layout

- Plot design: Plot-level sampling with a standard circular approach (5 m radius) for all C pools; one method for degraded land
- Within-plot stratification (closed canopy and fallows):
  - Four circular subplots with concentric-radius measurements to inventory saplings, small trees, larger trees, and a transect for lying dead wood
  - Data collected include DBH, height, local names, and wood density class (Sound/I/R)
  - Direct biomass measurements conducted on a subset of trees in closed canopy
- Degraded land (tany maty): Biomass, root description, and percent cover collected; no substantial tree inventory due to land-use type

## Biomass, Litter, Understorey, Root, and Soil Sampling

- Aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree components:
  - Direct measurement of 54 trees (selected by species contribution) in closed canopy: field weighing of trunk, branches, leaves; samples for moisture; dendrometric data recorded
- Understorey, litter, and root mat:
  - Litter/root mat: 25 cm x 25 cm quadrats
  - Understorey: 1 m x 1 m quadrats; biomass weighed after oven-drying
  - Root description: 1 m² soil pit per plot center to classify roots (Medium MR < 10 mm, Coarse CR > 10 mm); roots washed, weighed, and described
- Root and soil context:
  - Soil pits describe horizons, color (Munsell), texture, structure, porosity, and root depth
  - Percent cover estimated for indicator species using Braun-Blanquet scale (0 to >95%)
- Soil sampling:
  - Bulk density: 8.1 cm diameter cylinders, depths 0–10 to 80–90 cm
  - Soil carbon: auger sampling to 100 cm depth in 4 subplots
  - Soil profile: 1.3 m depth pit in subplot 1 for horizon characterization
  - Additional data: GPS coordinates, slope, deforestation history

## Laboratory Analyses

- Biomass processing:
  - Air drying, oven drying at 75°C to determine dry biomass
  - Wood Specific Gravity (WSG) determined in follow-up work (Manual n°4)
- Soil analyses:
  - Sample preparation: air-dry, sieve to 2 mm, separate coarse fraction
  - Moisture determination: 105°C drying
  - Walkley-Black method for SOC calibration
  - Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for soil carbon content
  - Stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) on selected samples (France LBMP) for land-use interpretation
- Data relevance: Analyses feed into SOC stock calculations and cross-pool carbon budgeting

## Data Handling, Archiving, and Storage

- Data entry and archiving:
  - Field forms scanned and stored in project numeric archive
  - Field data entered into Excel; photos renamed and stored at Bangor University data center
  - Data organized into series and deposited in EIDC for long-term storage and valorization
- Samples management:
  - Field-collected samples sent to LRI lab; lab numbers assigned; chain-of-custody maintained
- Data and metadata practices:
  - Clear linkage between field data, laboratory results, and invoked standard methods; datasets prepared for publication and later re-use

## Biomass and Soil Stock Calculations

- Aboveground biomass (AGB):
  - Allometry-based estimation using tree measurements (DBH, height) and wood density (WSG) with equations from literature (e.g., Chave et al.)
  - Plot-level AGB derived by summing per-tree biomass within a hectare-equivalent area
  - Carbon stock derived from biomass using established conversion factors
- Litter, understorey, roots:
  - Biomass densities scaled to 1 ha using measured sample areas; C stocks calculated with Brown (2002) factor
- Dead wood:
  - Lying dead wood: volume-based biomass using geometric calculations and wood density classes
  - Standing dead wood: volume-based biomass using species-specific density and height
- Soil organic carbon (SOC):
  - SOC stock per depth (SOC30 and SOC100) calculated using bulk density, carbon content, coarse fraction corrections, and layer thickness
  - Equivalent mass method used to account for density differences across land uses
- Output focus: SOC stocks, total carbon per plot, and per-land-use comparisons across ZOIs
