# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- Context and aim
  - The p4ges project in Madagascar investigates paying for global ecosystem services to reduce poverty, focusing on carbon stocks in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ).
  - WP4 assesses carbon stocks across five pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon) to support carbon quantification and inform policy decisions related to ecosystem service payments.
  - The manual documents the first step of the carbon survey design and data handling, with datasets archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

- Monitoring framework and governance orientation
  - Emphasizes a multi-pool carbon monitoring framework designed to support policy scrutiny and future decision making.
  - Links field data collection with laboratory analyses, data management, and public data sharing, highlighting QA, transparency, and data governance.

- Zone of Interest (ZOI) and site selection
  - Four ZOIs chosen to represent CAZ variation: Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, and Didy.
  - Land-use classifications used: closed canopy, tree fallow, shrub fallow, tany maty/degraded land; reforestation considered as an additional land-use type.
  - Site selection criteria (for comparability and accuracy): slope < 45 degrees, transects near patch centers to minimize edge effects, minimum patch area of 120 m x 120 m, avoidance of disturbances (e.g., mining), rivers avoided for transect placement, and at least 500 m between sites.
  - Sampling design aims: 16 plots per ZOI (4 land-use types × 4 replicates); extra plots within each ZOI to capture carbon stock variability, resulting in totals of 28 sites (ZOI1), 48 (ZOI2), 28 (ZOI3), and 28 (ZOI4).
  - Remote sensing and field reconnaissance used to identify and verify site suitability; a minimal representative sampling unit (16 m2) established via species inventories to guide consistency across pools.

- Field design and data collection
  - Field reconnaissance validated site suitability, indicator species, land-use history, and accessibility.
  - Data collection forms (five types) and field materials prepared to capture site characteristics, plant inventories, coverage, and soil profiles.
  - Plot-level sampling design (5 m radius) applies across land uses, with nested subplots and transects:
    - Closed canopy and fallows: circular plots with four subplots; progressive radii used to inventory saplings, small and large trees, standing and lying dead wood, and to record local names and densities.
    - Degraded land (tany maty): biomass, root description, and percent cover captured; no tall tree inventory required.
  - Biomass measurement approaches
    - Direct aboveground biomass: a subset of trees felled and weighed (trunk, branches, leaves) to derive component weights; subsamples for moisture analysis.
    - Allometric approaches for plot-level biomass using measured dendrometric variables (DBH, height) and wood density, scaled to per-hectare biomass and carbon stock.
  - Understorey, litter, and root mat sampling
    - Quadrats for litter/root mat (25 cm × 25 cm) and understorey vegetation (1 m × 1 m) with weights measured and samples prepared for lab analyses.
    - Root sampling via soil pits in plot centers; roots classified into medium and coarse categories, described by depth and distribution.
  - Soil sampling and profiling
    - Soil cores/augers for carbon content at 0–100 cm depth (10 cm intervals); supplemental bulk density sampling with cylinders at specified depths.
    - Soil profile description to depth 1.30 m for horizon characterization, color, texture, structure, and root depth.
    - Additional data: GPS coordinates, slope, deforestation history.

- Data handling, storage, and traceability
  - Field forms scanned and stored in the project archive; data entered into Excel; photos organized and stored; datasets archived in EIDC for long-term access.
  - Samples sent to LRI laboratory for analysis; strict labeling, lab numbering, and traceability between field and lab data maintained.
  - Data series structured to support long-term storage, valorization, and cross-pool carbon stock calculations.

- Laboratory analyses and carbon quantification
  - Biomass processing: air-dried samples oven-dried at 75°C to determine dry biomass; wood specific gravity determined separately.
  - Soil analyses
    - Soil moisture via drying; Walkley-Black method for soil organic carbon calibration; Mid Infra-Red Spectroscopy (MIRS) for rapid SOC prediction; δ13C stable isotope analyses for land-use discrimination and carbon dynamics (subset of samples).
  - Carbon stock calculations
    - Aboveground: biomass per tree estimated with allometry or direct weighing; plot- and hectare-level scaling; carbon stock derived from biomass using established conversion factors.
    - Litter, understorey, and root mats: dry-weight biomass scaled to hectare; carbon stock using standard conversion.
    - Dead wood: volume and density-based biomass calculations for standing and lying dead wood, with appropriate wood density classes (Sound, Intermediate, Rotten).
    - Soil organic carbon: SOC stock calculated by incorporating bulk density, carbon content, depth, and coarse fraction; both SOC30 and SOC100 considered; equivalent mass method used to compare across land uses.

- Data analysis and reporting for monitoring purposes
  - Analytical framework integrates floristic structure, Braun-Blanquet cover estimates, and spatial distribution to interpret biomass and carbon stocks.
  - Allometry and direct measurements combine to yield comprehensive carbon stock estimates by pool, plot, and per-hectare basis.
  - Outputs intended for scientific publications, policy briefs, and data-driven decisions about ecosystem service payments and land-use management.

- Data publication and references
  - Publication of findings and contributions to broader Madagascar soil carbon mapping and land-use change studies; several cited works provide context for methods and interpretations.
  - Reference list includes Braun-Blanquet (1964), Brown (2002), IPCC guidelines, and regional Madagascar carbon studies.

- Practical considerations and challenges highlighted for monitoring frameworks
  - Data gaps and access issues (availability, timeliness, and metadata quality) can hinder comprehensive monitoring.
  - Organizational silos and barriers to public data sharing; ensuring data openness requires governance and clear metadata.
  - The need for consistent data standards, data stewardship from the point of collection (source data) through archiving, and transparent data transformation processes.
  - Communication of complex, multi-pool carbon findings to policy-makers; developing clear visualization and reporting formats is essential.

- Takeaways for monitoring framework authors
  - Implement zone-based, representative sampling to capture ecosystem variability; align field design with policy-relevant outputs (e.g., carbon stock by pool, land-use change implications).
  - Integrate robust QA/QC, data provenance, and traceability from field collection to lab analyses and final datasets.
  - Prioritize metadata completeness and open data sharing while respecting data governance requirements.
  - Use a combination of direct measurements and validated allometric approaches to balance accuracy and practicality in large-scale monitoring.
  - Establish clear data publication pathways and link to policy-relevant outcomes (e.g., carbon stock estimates, tiered land-use assessments).
