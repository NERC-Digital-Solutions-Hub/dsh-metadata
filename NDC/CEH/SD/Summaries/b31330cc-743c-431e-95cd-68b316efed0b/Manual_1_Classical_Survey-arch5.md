# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

## Overview and purpose
- Context: Part of the p4ges project in Madagascar, aiming to influence the international pay-for-ecosystem-services framework and poverty alleviation.
- Focus: Carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ) across IPCC-defined pools (AGB, BGB, litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon).
- Output intent: Establish a foundational carbon quantification method for CAZ; datasets archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) with broader publication planned.
- Update: Document updated February 2017.

## Study design and data scope
- Zones of Interest (ZOI): Four zones (Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, Didy) chosen to represent CAZ biophysical and land-use conditions.
- Land uses (LU): Closed canopy, tree fallow, shrub fallow, tany maty (degraded land); reforestation noted via NGO/community input.
- Site criteria: Slope < 45°, center-location within habitat patches to minimize edge effects, minimum 120m x 120m plots, avoidance of disturbances, non-stream transects, spacing ≥ 500m between sites.
- Sampling intensity:
  - 16 plots per ZOI (4 LU x 4 replicates) initially; additional plots to capture C stock variability for WP4.
  - Total sites: ZOI1 (28), ZOI2 (48), ZOI3 (28), ZOI4 (28).
- Site identification: Remote sensing for location; field reconnaissance to validate suitability and land-use classification; minimal area test (inventory in 1m x 1m quadrats, scaled to determine minimal representative area of 16 m² for carbon stock quantification).

## Field data collection and site design
- Administrative and preparatory work: permits, mission orders, insurances; field forms prepared (site characteristics, inventory, Braun-Blanquet cover, sapling/litter/root sampling, soil profile).
- Field tools and samples: compasses, vertex, flags, quadrats, soil augers, cylinders; labeled sample bags; photos and data stored with project data management.
- Plot design (plot-level sampling): Circular plots with concentric subplots for multi-pool biomass assessment.
  - Closed canopy and fallows: four subplots within a circular plot (2 m, 5 m, 10 m, 20 m radii) to capture saplings, understorey, and tree biomass across size classes; lying dead wood measured along a 100 m transect.
  - Degraded land (tany maty): biomass, root description, and percent cover data collected similarly, but no >5 cm diameter trees.
- Data collection within plots:
  - Aboveground biomass: direct measurement on a subset of trees (54) by felling and weighing trunk/branch/leaves; concomitant humidity sampling; allometric estimates for plot-level biomass.
  - Litter, understorey, and root mats: 25 cm x 25 cm quadrats for litter/root mats; 1 m x 1 m quadrats for understorey biomass; samples sent to lab.
  - Root sampling: soil pits (1 m²) in plot center; roots categorized as medium (<10 mm) or coarse (>10 mm); density and depth described.
  - Percent cover: Braun-Blanquet scale (0 to >95%) for indicator species within a 5 m radius.
- Soil sampling and description:
  - Subplots: soil samples collected at four points per subplot for carbon content (every 10 cm to 100 cm depth) and bulk density (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm) using auger and cylinders.
  - Soil profile: description in soil pit (1.3 m depth) documenting horizons, color (Munsell), textures, structures, root abundance, and porosity.

## Data handling, storage, and QA
- Field data management:
  - Field forms scanned and archived; data entered in Excel; photos renamed and stored in Bangor University data center.
  - Data organized into series and deposited in the EIDC WP4 repository for long-term storage and valorization.
- Laboratory data handling:
  - Samples transported to LRI (Laboratoire des RadioIsotopes) in Antananarivo for analysis; dry mass and moisture content determined;  laboratory numbering linked to field provenance.
  - Soil analyses include Walkley-Black SOC estimation, Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for SOC prediction, and δ13C stable isotope analysis (Montpellier, France) for carbon dynamics.
- Data processing and calculations:
  - Aboveground biomass: allometric methods (various allometry equations, e.g., Chave et al.; Brown 2002) to estimate biomass per tree, then plot-level density and carbon stock; use of wood density (WSG) and layering by tree components.
  - Litter/understorey/root: biomass densities scaled to per-hectare; carbon stock via 0.5 conversion factor (Brown, 2002).
  - Dead wood: lying dead wood biomass via volume-diameter-density approach; standing dead wood via volume-density method; total plot biomass summed across pools.
  - Soil carbon stocks: SOC per layer calculated using bulk density, carbon content, coarse fraction, and layer thickness; both SOC30 and SOC100 depths considered; equivalent mass method used to account for density differences across land uses.
- Data publication:
  - Datasets intended for publication; listed exemplar publications and ongoing work; data are curated for dissemination and future use.

## Particular challenges and governance considerations (aligned with Data Stewards)
- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities; ensure datasets are discoverable and usable for diverse stakeholders.
- Timely data delivery from field to archive; establish clear data submission timelines and QA steps.
- Consistency and completeness of metadata, including field forms, units, and abbreviations (e.g., AGB, BGB, SOC, LU, ZOI).
- Interoperability across land uses, depths, and pool definitions; documentation of methods and equations used for allometric and soil calculations.
- Managing data across multiple systems (remote sensing, field notebooks, lab data, and multiple databases); robust provenance tracking and version control.
- Handling large datasets with complex structure (plots, subplots, pools, depths); clear data schemas and data dictionaries.
- Long-term storage and access: ensuring EIDC repository and Bangor University data center hosting remain accessible, with proper data publication workflows and licensing.
