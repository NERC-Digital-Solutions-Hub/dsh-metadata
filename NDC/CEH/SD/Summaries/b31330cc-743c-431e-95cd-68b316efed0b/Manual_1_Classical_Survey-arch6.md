# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- The project aims to quantify carbon stocks across the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ) in eastern Madagascar to support pay-for-ecosystem-services initiatives and inform land-use policy.
- Focus pools: Aboveground biomass (AGB), Belowground biomass (BGB), litter, dead wood (DW), and soil organic carbon (SOC) across multiple land uses.
- Outputs intended as basis for carbon accounting, with datasets archived for long-term use.

## Context and Objectives

- The ESPA p4ges project seeks to influence international uptake of payments for ecosystem services by providing robust carbon stock data from CAZ.
- WP4-specific work quantified carbon across five IPCC-defined pools (AGB, BGB, litter, DW, SOC) and focused on AGB, litter, deadwood, and soil surveys to establish baseline carbon stocks.
- All datasets generated are archived with environmental information data centre (EIDC) and related laboratories.

## Study Design and Area

- Zone of Interest (ZOI) selection to capture CAZ representativeness:
  - ZOI1 Lakato, ZOI2 Andasibe, ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, ZOI4 Didy.
  - Criteria: biophysical variables (altitude, slope, bioclimate, dry season length, soil type), deforestation history, access.
- Land uses (LU) defined for sampling:
  - Closed canopy, tree fallow, shrub fallow, tany maty/degraded land, plus reforestation identified via NGO/local input.
- Site and sampling design:
  - Each ZOI targeted 16 plots (4 LU x 4 replicates) to capture LU variability.
  - WP4 added extra plots within each ZOI to capture carbon stock variability, totaling:
    - ZOI1: 28 sites, ZOI2: 48 sites, ZOI3: 28 sites, ZOI4: 28 sites.
- Field reconnaissance and minimal area testing:
  - Reconnaissance teams validated field suitability and land-use type.
  - Minimal representative area established at 16 m² for robust C stock quantification.

## Field Sampling Protocols

- Plot design (plot-level sampling):
  - General plot: 5 m radius for carbon pool surveys (constant across LU, except degraded land as noted).
  - Subplots within each plot (circular radii):
    - 2 m radius: sapling inventory (DBH < 5 cm, H > 1.3 m) with species sampling; 5 randomly selected saplings weighed and sampled.
    - 5 m radius: trees with DBH 5–10 cm to record DBH, height, and local names.
    - 10 m radius: trees with DBH 10–20 cm (DBH and height; local names).
    - 20 m radius: trees >20 cm DBH (DBH, height, local names) and standing dead wood characterization (including top measurements for some cohorts).
  - Lying dead wood: measured along a 100 m transect through plot center; diameter at rope intercepts recorded and wood density categorized.
  - Bore and density: for standing dead wood, densities recorded (Sound, Intermediate, Rotten) per CI Madagascar classifications.
- Specific pools and sampling by LU:
  - Closed canopy and fallows: comprehensive forest inventory including saplings, trees, standing and fallen dead wood, litter, and root mats.
  - Degraded land (tany maty): biomass sampling and root descriptions, but no tall-tree inventories due to absence of DBH > 5 cm trees.
- Direct biomass measurement (AGB):
  - In closed canopy, 54 trees from four species felled and weighed (trunk, branches, leaves) after field harvesting and lab humidity analysis; combined with allometric estimates.
- Understorey, litter, and root mats:
  - Understorey: 1 m x 1 m quadrats; litter/root mats: 25 cm x 25 cm quadrats; all biomass weighed and recorded; samples sent to lab.
- Soil and root sampling:
  - Soil: four subplots per plot; two methods:
    - Auger sampling for soil carbon content (0–100 cm, in 10 cm increments).
    - Cylinders for bulk density (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm).
  - Soil profile description in a central soil pit to 1.3 m depth (horizons, colors, textures, root depth, porosity).
  - Additional data: GPS coordinates, slope, deforestation history.

## Laboratory and Analytical Procedures

- Biomass processing:
  - Drying biomass samples at 75°C to constant weight; weights used to compute dry biomass and carbon stocks via established allometric approaches.
  - Wood specific gravity (WSG) determined for relevant samples.
- Soil analyses:
  - Sample preparation included air-drying, sieving to 2 mm, separating coarse fractions, and grinding to 200 µm for analyses.
  - Moisture determination via oven-drying at 105°C.
  - Walkley-Black method for soil organic carbon calibration; Mid Infra-Red Spectroscopy (MIRS) for SOC predictions.
  - Stable isotope analysis (δ13C) for selected samples (in collaboration with Montpellier lab) to inform carbon dynamics and land-use classification.
- Data handling and integration:
  - Lab and field data linked via field-to-lab numbering and worksheets; samples tracked and logged in project data systems.
  - Data and photos archived in project storage and at EIDC for long-term valorization.

## Data Handling, Analysis, and Scaling

- Data handling philosophy:
  - Field forms scanned and archived; data entered into Excel; photos organized and stored; datasets prepared for long-term storage at EIDC.
- Aboveground biomass (AGB) calculations:
  - Allometric equations (per Chave et al., Vielledent et al., and other established sources) used to estimate tree-level biomass (kg tree-1) from dendrometric variables (DBH, height, WSG).
  - Plot-level biomass density (Mg ha-1) derived by summing tree biomass within the plot area and scaling to per-hectare.
  - Carbon stock estimated by applying conversion factors (e.g., 0.5 biomass-to-carbon factor) as per Brown (2002) and related literature.
- Litter, understorey, and root mats:
  - Dry weights converted to plot-level densities and scaled to Mg ha-1; carbon stocks derived using the same 0.5 conversion factor.
- Dead wood carbon stocks:
  - Lying dead wood: volume estimates from intercepts and lengths, multiplied by wood density; biomass per piece aggregated to plot level.
  - Standing dead wood: volume and density used to compute biomass per tree; summation across plot yields plot-level values.
- Soil carbon stocks:
  - SOC stocks calculated for 0–30 cm and 0–100 cm depths using a soil-weighted approach:
    SOC = sum(BD_i × C_i × (1 − CF_i) × t_i × 0.1)
  - Consideration of coarse fraction (CF_i) and equivalent mass method to account for density differences across land uses.
- Data products:
  - Outputs designed to support carbon stock mapping and land-use impact analyses, with datasets published in scientific papers and data repositories.
