# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon)

- Aims and scope
  - Madagascar project to influence international payment for ecosystem services by quantifying carbon stocks in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ).
  - Carbon stock assessment across five pools (per IPCC 2006): Aboveground biomass (AGB), Belowground biomass (BGB), litter, dead wood (DW), and soil organic carbon (SOC).
  - Establishes a first-step, standardized design and data workflow for carbon quantification within a forest ecosystem, focusing on AGB, litter, deadwood, and soil surveys.

- Study design and zones
  - Zones of Interest (ZOI): Four representative zones (ZOI1 Lakato, ZOI2 Andasibe, ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, ZOI4 Didy) chosen to reflect CAZ variability.
  - Land uses (LU) defined for sampling: Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty/degraded land, plus reforestation (identified via NGO/community input).
  - Site selection criteria beyond LU: slope < 45°, plots near habitat centers to reduce edge effects, minimum patch size 120 m x 120 m, avoidance of streams and unusual disturbances, and a minimum 500 m separation between sites.
  - Sampling density: 16 plots per ZOI (4 LU types x 4 replicates), with WP4-specific extra plots to capture carbon stock variability.
  - Total surveyed sites: 28 (ZOI1), 48 (ZOI2), 28 (ZOI3), 28 (ZOI4).

- Field reconnaissance and sampling framework
  - Field reconnaissance to validate remote-sensed site selection, assess indicator species, land-use history, and accessibility.
  - Minimal area test to establish the representative sampling unit; initial 1 m x 1 m plots expanded until no new species appeared, establishing a minimal area of 16 m² for carbon stock surveys.
  - Field forms and materials prepared for site characteristics, inventory (including regeneration, dead wood, tree inventory), percent cover (Braun-Blanquet), sapling, litter, root sampling, and soil profile description.
  - Plot design and measurements
    - General plot: 5 m radius circle for all C pool surveys.
    - Closed canopy and forest fallows: four concentric sub-areas within the plot
      - 2 m radius: sapling inventory (DBH < 5 cm, H > 1.3 m), 5 randomly selected saplings weighed and sampled.
      - 5 m radius: trees 5–10 cm DBH measured (and labeled), including living and standing dead wood.
      - 10 m radius: trees 10–20 cm DBH measured and labeled.
      - 20 m radius: trees >20 cm DBH measured and labeled.
      - Standing dead wood: DBH and height; wood density class recorded (Sound, Intermediate, Rotten).
      - Lying dead wood: measured along a 100 m transect; diameter at intercept recorded and wood density noted.
    - Understorey vegetation, litter, and root mat: sampled within the central subplots and additional points; 25 cm x 25 cm quadrats for litter/root mat; 1 m x 1 m quadrats for understorey biomass.
    - Root sampling: 1 m² soil pit for root description and sampling; roots categorized as Medium Root (2–10 mm) and Coarse Root (>10 mm); root distribution described along soil profile.
    - Percent cover: indicator species estimated within a 5 m radius, using Braun-Blanquet scale.
  - Degraded land (tany maty): no large trees; biomass, root mat, litter, understorey sampling still performed following the same plot design where feasible.

- Soil sampling and analysis
  - Soil sampling in the same subplots used for understorey sampling.
  - Two methods per subplot: auger sampling for soil carbon content (0–100 cm, in 10 cm increments) and cylinder sampling for bulk density (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm, 50–60 cm, 80–90 cm).
  - Soil profile description to 1.30 m depth in subplot 1 to characterize horizons, colors, textures, structures, and root distribution.
  - Additional soil data: GPS coordinates, slope, and deforestation history.

- Administrative, data handling, and storage
  - Pre-field: permits, mission orders, and insurance.
  - Field forms: five types of data collection sheets (site characteristics, inventory, Braun-Blanquet cover, biomass/litter/root sampling, soil profile).
  - Data recording and storage: field data scanned and stored; Excel data entry; photos archived at project data center; data uploaded to Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) for long-term storage and valorisation.
  - Sample management: field-to-lab tracking with lab numbers and provenance; samples stored at room temperature and air-dried prior to analysis.

- Laboratory analyses
  - Biomass: samples air-dried, then oven-dried at 75°C to determine dry biomass; wood specific gravity (WSG) determined later (Manual n°4).
  - Soil analyses
    - Walkley-Black method for rapid soil organic carbon (SOC) estimation, with calibration using standard references.
    - Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for predictive SOC content based on soil spectra.
    - Stable isotope analysis (δ13C) for selected samples along land-use types to study carbon dynamics; analysis performed at LBMP Montpellier.
  - All laboratory data linked to field provenance and archived in the EIDC.

- Data processing and carbon stock estimation
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB)
    - Use of allometric equations (e.g., Chave et al. 2005/2014; Vielledent et al. 2012) to estimate tree-level biomass from dendrometric data (DBH, height, WSG).
    - Plot-level AGB density computed by summing tree biomass and scaling from each plot to 1 hectare.
    - Carbon stock calculated from biomass using standard conversion factors (e.g., 0.5 or species-specific coefficients).
  - Litter, understorey vegetation, and root mat
    - Dry weights from field samples converted to plot-level biomass and then to carbon stock using the same 0.5 conversion factor.
  - Dead wood
    - Lying dead wood: biomass computed from volume and density with appropriate geometric approximations.
    - Standing dead wood: biomass estimated from volume and density; densities categorized as S/I/R.
    - Plot-level DW and carbon stock summed across components.
  - Soil carbon
    - SOC stock calculated per soil layer (0–30 cm or 0–100 cm) using: SOC = sum(BD_i × C_i × (1 − CF_i) × t_i × 0.1), where BD is bulk density, C_i is soil carbon content, CF_i is coarse fraction, t_i is layer thickness.
    - Consideration of equivalent mass method to account for density differences across land uses.
  - Outputs
    - C stocks for all pools by site, land-use type, and Zone of Interest; data intended for publication and policy-relevant reporting.

- Data publication and references
  - Data and findings published in scientific papers and reports, with specific references cited for soil carbon mapping, land-use impacts on C stocks, and methodology.
  - Key sources include Braun-Blanquet (vegetation cover), Brown (carbon measurement framework), IPCC guidelines, and region-specific Madagascar soil carbon work.

- Practical implications for environmental analysts
  - A standardized, replication-friendly protocol for estimating carbon stocks across multiple land uses in tropical forest corridors.
  - Emphasis on data provenance, QA/QC through field reconnaissance, minimal area testing, and harmonized lab analyses.
  - Robust data handling and long-term storage via EIDC to enable cross-site comparisons and historical trend analysis.
  - Clear pathway from field measurements to plot-level and site-level carbon stock estimates using widely adopted allometric and soil carbon methods.
