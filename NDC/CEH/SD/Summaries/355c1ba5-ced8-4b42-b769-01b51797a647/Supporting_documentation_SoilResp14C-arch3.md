# Soil respired radiocarbon as CO2 and CH4 from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Objective and scope
  - Quantify the radiocarbon content (14C) of soil-respired CO2 and CH4 in subarctic Canada to understand carbon dynamics across peatland plateaus, thawing peatland features, and burnt vs. unburnt forests affected by permafrost.
  - Field campaigns conducted in summer 2013 near Teslin and 2014 near Yellowknife; multiple sites and vegetation/landscape types sampled.

- Sites and sampling design
  - CO2 sampling sites (replicates at each):
    - FFU (FireFox Unburnt), FFB (FireFox Burnt, 1998), TPP (Teslin Peatland Plateau), TWM (Teslin Wetland Margin), MCU (Mosquito Creek Unburnt), MCB (Mosquito Creek Burnt), WTP (White Truck Plateau), WTM (White Truck Moss), WTS (White Truck Sedge), WTW (White Truck Wetland).
  - CH4 sampling sites (replicates at each):
    - TW (Teslin Wetland; includes two positions along thawed feature: TW5m and TWMID), WTM (White Truck Moss), WTS (White Truck Sedge), WTW (White Truck Wetland).
  - For each site and gas type, three replicate locations were used (e.g., FFU1, FFU2, FFU3).
  - Sample types at each location:
    - DEEP, BOTTOM (collars), and PROBE (depth-specific probe sampling).

- Depths and collar/probe setup
  - DEEP and BOTTOM collars: typically deployed at 35/40 cm depth (30 cm in the TPP site) to capture respiration from different soil layers; BOTTOM excludes deeper respiration by sealing at the bottom.
  - PROBE sampling: stainless steel tube inserted to a target depth; perforated end covered with a waterproof, gas-permeable membrane; above-ground end connected to tubing with shut-off connectors to prevent atmospheric air ingress.

- CO2 sampling procedure
  - CO2 headspace accumulation: PVC chamber placed on top of collars to accumulate CO2 until ~800 ppm or higher.
  - Atmospheric CO2 reduction: gas-tight pump circulates headspace through soda lime to reduce CO2 to ~200 ppm.
  - CO2 capture for 14C: zeolite molecular sieve (Type 13X) connected to the chamber to absorb CO2; left in place for several days.
  - Seasonal replication for representativeness: the same sieve linked to each sampling location twice during the growing season (late July/early August and late August/early September).
  - PROBE sampling: zeolite sieve connected to the shut-off/PROBE connectors to collect CO2 passively.

- CH4 sampling procedure
  - DEEP and BOTTOM CH4: PVC chamber used; CH4 concentration monitored with a DP-IR CH4 analyzer; CH4 captured in a 10 L foil gas sample bag for lab processing.
  - PROBE CH4: soil water drawn from probes, degassed into a 10 L gas bag.
  - Laboratory processing (both CO2 and CH4): CO2 is removed from samples; CH4 is combusted to CO2 and trapped on a zeolite sieve (Type 13X) for 14C analysis.

- Laboratory analysis and data output
  - Sieves collected and sent to the NERC Radiocarbon Facility in East Kilbride (UK) for graphitization and 14C analysis by AMS.
  - Results expressed as percent modern carbon (pMC).
  - Ages reported as conventional radiocarbon ages (years BP; “present” = AD 1950).
  - Reference framework for CH4 sampling and processing follows Garnett et al. (2012).

- Temporal design and representativeness
  - Repeated sampling within the growing season to capture temporal variability in radiocarbon signatures across site types and gas (CO2 vs CH4).

- Implications for monitoring and policy evaluation
  - The multi-site, multi-vegetation/landscape design across burnt and unburnt forests and thawing peatlands provides a framework to monitor how permafrost-related carbon dynamics and fire history affect soil-respired CO2 and CH4 radiocarbon signatures.
  - Standardized, replicated methods and centralized laboratory processing support comparability over time and across landscapes, aiding environmental health monitoring, data verification, and informing management decisions regarding carbon cycling in subarctic ecosystems.
