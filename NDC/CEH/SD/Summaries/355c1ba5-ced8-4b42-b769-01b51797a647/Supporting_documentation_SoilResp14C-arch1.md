# Soil respired radiocarbon as CO2 and CH4 from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Purpose
  - Measure radiocarbon content of soil-respired CO2 and CH4 to understand sources and seasonal dynamics across different permafrost-affected ecosystems in subarctic Canada.
  - Compare respired radiocarbon signatures among peatland plateaus, thawing peatland plateaus, burnt and unburnt black spruce forests.

- Study locations and site types
  - CO2 sampling sites: FFU (unburnt), FFB (burnt, 1998), TPP (Teslin peatland plateau), TWM (Teslin wetland margin), MCU (Mosquito Creek unburnt), MCB (Mosquito Creek burnt), WTP (White Truck plateau), WTM (White Truck moss), WTS (White Truck sedge), WTW (White Truck wetland).
  - CH4 sampling sites: TW (Teslin wetland, with 5 m and center positions), WTM (White Truck moss), WTS (White Truck sedge), WTW (White Truck wetland).
  - Replication: three replicate locations per site (e.g., FFU1, FFU2, FFU3), with three sample types at each location.

- Sample types and depths
  - DEEP: deeper soil respiration using a PVC collar (collected around 35/40 cm depth, or 30 cm at TPP).
  - BOTTOM: collar sealed at bottom to exclude deeper respiration.
  - PROBE: stainless steel tube inserted into soil to sample gas at a specific depth; end perforated and covered with a gas-permeable membrane; other end connected to tubing with shut-off connectors.
  - Vegetation treatment: clip vegetation on CO2 collars at sampling locations; no clipping for CH4 sampling.

- CO2 sampling procedure
  - Chamber-based accumulation on top of DEEP/BOTTOM collars to reach ~800 ppm CO2 in headspace.
  - Atmospheric CO2 reduced by circulating headspace through soda lime to ~200 ppm.
  - Passive diffusion of CO2 through a zeolite sieve (type 13X) to collect for 14C analysis.
  - Repeated sampling: two 14C collection periods during the growing season (approximately late July/early August and again late August/early September) using the same sieve.

- CH4 sampling procedure
  - DEEP/BOTTOM CH4: use PVC chambers to collect headspace; monitor CH4 with a Detecto Pak-IR analyser; transfer to a 10 L gas sample bag for lab processing.
  - PROBE CH4: extract soil water, degas CH4 into headspace of a 10 L gas bag.
  - Lab processing: CO2 removed, CH4 combusted to CO2, then trapped on a zeolite sieve (type 13X).

- Laboratory analysis
  - Sieves and samples sent to the NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride, UK) for graphitization and 14C analysis by AMS.
  - Results expressed as percent modern carbon (pMC); ages reported as conventional radiocarbon age (years BP, with present defined as AD 1950).
  - Sample codes (publication_code) track the dataset provenance.

- References and context
  - Methodological basis for CH4 sampling and 14C analysis referenced to Garnett et al. (2012) for methane radiocarbon analysis.
  - Provides a structured dataset for comparing contemporary and thawed peatland processes, fire effects, and carbon cycling across subarctic environments.

- Data handling and outputs
  - Replicate-level data across multiple sites and gas types (CO2, CH4) and depths allow interpretation of depth- and vegetation-related radiocarbon signatures.
  - Data are prepared for integration into broader datasets and accessible via metadata-rich records (dataset codes) tied to radiocarbon results and sample provenance.
