Soil respired radiocarbon as CO2 and CH4 from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Examines radiocarbon content of soil respired CO2 and CH4 from diverse subarctic Canadian sites during summer 2013 (Teslin area) and 2014 (Yellowknife area).
- Aims to support data-driven understanding of soil gas production across peatlands, thaw features, and forests (burnt and unburnt).
- Data are generated from replicated field sampling and processed for 14C analysis, with results reported as percent modern carbon and conventional radiocarbon ages (years BP).

## Study sites and sampling design
- Sites for CO2 sampling:
  - FFU – FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
  - FFB – FireFox Burnt (burnt in 1998)
  - TPP – Teslin Peatland Plateau
  - TWM – Teslin Wetland Margin
  - MCU – Mosquito Creek Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
  - MCB – Mosquito Creek Burnt
  - WTP – White Truck Plateau
  - WTM – White Truck Moss
  - WTS – White Truck Sedge
  - WTW – White Truck Wetland
- Sites for CH4 sampling include:
  - TW – Teslin Wetland (with positions at 5 m and center)
  - WTM – White Truck Moss
  - WTS – White Truck Sedge
  - WTW – White Truck Wetland
- Experimental design:
  - Three replicate locations per site and gas type (e.g., FFU1–FFU3, etc.).
  - Within each replicate, samples from DEEP, BOTTOM, and PROBE (depth-specific) categories.
  - CO2 sampling involved surface vegetation clipping at collar locations; CH4 sampling generally did not clip vegetation.
  - Sampling seasons spanned the growing season, with repeated collection of samples/replicates.

## Sampling and measurement methods
- CO2 sampling (collars):
  - PVC chamber placed on DEEP/BOTTOM collars; CO2 allowed to accumulate to ~800 ppm, then air swapped with soda lime to reduce to ~200 ppm.
  - A zeolite molecular sieve (Type 13X) connected to the chamber to absorb CO2; left for days, then disconnected.
  - Process repeated twice during the growing season (late July/early August and late August/early September) to capture representative 14C signatures.
- CO2 sampling (PROBE):
  - Zeolite sieve connected to a shut-off probe to passively diffuse CO2 from a specific depth.
- CH4 sampling (collars):
  - PVC chambers used; headspace CH4 concentration monitored with a DP-IR analyzer.
  - CH4 collected into 10 L foil gas sample bags for lab processing.
- CH4 sampling (PROBE):
  - Soil water extracted from probes, degassed CH4 transferred to a 10 L gas bag for collection.
- Laboratory processing:
  - CO2 removed from samples; CH4 combusted to CO2 and trapped on a zeolite sieve (Type 13X).
  - Sieves sent to NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride, UK) for graphitization and AMS 14C analysis.
  - Each sieve is assigned a code (Publication_code) for traceability.
- Data products:
  - Radiocarbon enrichment expressed as percent modern carbon (pMC).
  - Ages reported as conventional radiocarbon ages in years BP (present defined as AD 1950).

## Data management, provenance, and standards
- Provenance and traceability:
  - Replicate and sample-type identifiers (e.g., FFU1, PROBE) captured per site and gas type.
  - External laboratory processing (graphitization and AMS) with referencing to Publication_code for linking results.
- Metadata considerations:
  - Site type (peatland plateau, thawed feature, forest), treatment (burnt vs unburnt), vegetation context, and depth/category (DEEP, BOTTOM, PROBE) are defined for each sample.
  - Depths specified for collars (e.g., ~35/40 cm; 30 cm at TPP).
- Units and reporting:
  - pMC values and conventional 14C ages (years BP) are the standard data products.
- References and methodology:
  - CH4 processing and 14C analysis aligned with established method (Garnett et al., 2012); CO2 handling protocol includes soda lime and zeolite steps.

## Data governance and usability considerations for Data Leaders
- Data discoverability and interoperability:
  - Use of standardized site codes, replicate IDs, gas type, and sample location types (DEEP, BOTTOM, PROBE) enables cross-site comparisons.
  - Publication_code linking ensures traceability from field collection to AMS results.
- Data quality and reproducibility:
  - Replicated sampling (three replicates per site) and multiple sampling events within the growing season improve reliability.
  - Detailed sampling workflows (collar vs PROBE, CO2 vs CH4 procedures) support reproducibility and auditability.
- Metadata completeness:
  - Include depth, sampling location type, vegetation context, and date of collection to enable secondary analyses and meta-analyses.
- Collaboration and coordination:
  - Data origin spans field teams and an external radiocarbon facility; clear data lineage and standardized metadata schemas mitigate integration challenges.
- Potential data leadership considerations:
  - Ensure consistent metadata schemas across sites and years to support trend analyses.
  - Maintain documentation for method variations (e.g., vegetation clipping difference for CO2 vs CH4) to avoid misinterpretation.
  - Plan for data sharing or publication workflows that align field data with AMS results and the Publication_code system.
