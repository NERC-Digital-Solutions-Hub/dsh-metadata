# Soil respired radiocarbon as CO2 and CH4 from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Objective
  - Measure radiocarbon content (14C) of soil respired CO2 and CH4 to characterize the age and sources of carbon emitted from subarctic peatland plateaus, thawing peatland plateaus, and burnt/unburnt forests.
  - Compare conditions across fire history and thaw dynamics using standardised methods to enable temporal environmental health assessment.

- Study sites and sample types
  - Summer 2013 near Teslin; summer 2014 near Yellowknife.
  - CO2 sampling sites (representing different vegetation/soil contexts):
    - FFU: FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce)
    - FFB: FireFox Burnt (burnt in 1998)
    - TPP: Teslin Peatland Plateau
    - TWM: Teslin Wetland Margin
    - MCU: Mosquito Creek Unburnt
    - MCB: Mosquito Creek Burnt
    - WTP: White Truck Plateau
    - WTM: White Truck Moss
    - WTS: White Truck Sedge
    - WTW: White Truck Wetland
  - CH4 sampling sites (thawed peatland features):
    - TW: Teslin Wetland (with positions at 5 m and center)
    - WTM: White Truck Moss
    - WTS: White Truck Sedge
    - WTW: White Truck Wetland

- Field sampling design
  - Three replicate locations per site (e.g., FFU1, FFU2, FFU3).
  - At each replicate location, three sample types:
    - DEEP: deeper soil respiration using a collar
    - BOTTOM: bottom of collar (excluded deeper respiration)
    - PROBE: stainless steel probe inserted to a specific depth with a gas-permeable membrane
  - Depths: DEEP/BOTTOM collar depths typically ~30–40 cm (30 cm for TPP).
  - Vegetation handling: surface vascular vegetation clipped for CO2 sampling; not clipped for CH4 because vegetation aids CH4 transport.

- CO2 sampling protocol
  - Collars: PVC chamber placed over DEEP and BOTTOM collars; CO2 allowed to accumulate to ~800 ppm or higher.
  - Atmospheric correction: headspace circulated with soda lime to reduce CO2 to ~200 ppm.
  - 14C capture: zeolite molecular sieve (Type 13X) connected to chamber to absorb CO2; left for several days, then disconnected.
  - Seasonal replication: process repeated twice per growing season (late July/early August and late August/early September) with the same sieve location to obtain representative 14CO2 signals.

- CH4 sampling protocol
  - Collars: PVC chambers used to monitor CH4 concentration with a DP-IR CH4 analyser; CH4 transferred to 10 L foil gas sample bags for lab processing.
  - PROBE CH4: soil water extracted from probe, degassed into headspace, collected in a 10 L gas bag.
  - Laboratory processing: CO2 removed, CH4 combusted to CO2, then trapped on zeolite (13X).

- Sample handling and laboratory analysis
  - Sieve samples sent to the NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride, UK) for graphitization and 14C analysis by AMS; each sample given a code (Publication_code).
  - Radiocarbon values expressed as percent modern carbon (pMC); ages reported as conventional radiocarbon age in years BP (before present, defined as AD 1950).

- Seasonal and replication strategy
  - Multiple replicate locations per site (three per site) and multiple sample types (DEEP, BOTTOM, PROBE) to capture vertical and depth-dependent respiration signals.
  - Two sampling rounds per growing season to capture seasonal variability in 14C signatures.

- Data outputs and management
  - Outputs include radiocarbon enrichment values and conventional 14C ages for CO2 and CH4 under different site conditions (peatland, thawed peatland, burnt/unburnt forests).
  - Data are tied to standardized site codes and sample codes; datasets prepared for storage and upload to appropriate data portals to enable reuse and broader accessibility.

- Context and references
  - Builds on established methods for radiocarbon analysis of methane emissions from peatlands (Garnett et al., 2012).
  - Radiocarbon analysis performed at specialized facilities (AMS) to enable precise dating of respired carbon.

- Relevance for environmental monitoring
  - Provides a time- and condition-resolved view of the age of carbon being emitted from thawing permafrost-affected systems and fire-affected forests.
  - Supports interpretation of carbon cycling dynamics under permafrost thaw and land-use change, aligning with monitoring goals to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Emphasizes standardized methods, robust replication, and data accessibility to maximize value beyond single-use analyses.
