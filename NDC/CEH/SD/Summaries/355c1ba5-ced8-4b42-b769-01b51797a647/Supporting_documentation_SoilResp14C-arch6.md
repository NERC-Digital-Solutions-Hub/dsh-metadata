# Soil respired radiocarbon as CO2 and CH4 from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Field campaigns conducted in summer 2013 near Teslin and summer 2014 near Yellowknife to determine radiocarbon content (14C) of soil-respired CO2 and CH4.
- Measurements across multiple site types (peatland plateaus, thawing peatlands, burnt and unburnt forests) in subarctic Canada.
- Data intended for radiocarbon analysis (AMS) to understand carbon cycling and sources/sinks in these environments.

## Study Sites and Gas Types
- CO2 sampling sites (three replicates each; DEEP and BOTTOM collars, plus PROBE samples):
  - FFU - FireFox Unburnt
  - FFB - FireFox Burnt
  - TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau
  - TWM - Teslin Wetland Margin
  - MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt
  - MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt
  - WTP - White Truck Plateau
  - WTM - White Truck Moss
  - WTS - White Truck Sedge
  - WTW - White Truck Wetland
- CH4 sampling sites (three replicates each; DEEP/BOTTOM and PROBE):
  - TW - Teslin Wetland
  - WTM - White Truck Moss
  - WTS - White Truck Sedge
  - WTW - White Truck Wetland

## Sampling Design
- Replicates: three locations per site (e.g., FFU1, FFU2, FFU3).
- Sample types:
  - DEEP: deeper soil respiration using PVC collars (approx. 35/40 cm depth, or 30 cm at TPP).
  - BOTTOM: collar bottom sealed to exclude deeper respiration.
  - PROBE: stainless steel tube inserted to a specified depth with a perforated, gas-permeable membrane; end connected to tubing to collect gas.
- Depths and vegetation handling:
  - CO2: surface vegetation clipped where present; CH4 sampling sites left unclipped to preserve gas transport pathways.
  - Sampling windows aligned with thaw depth permitting installation of collars.

## CO2 Sampling and Processing
- Headspace accumulation: PVC chamber placed on DEEP/BOTTOM collars until CO2 ~800 ppm.
- Atmospheric correction: headspace circulated with soda lime to reduce CO2 to ~200 ppm.
- 14CO2 collection: zeolite Type 13X sieve connected to chamber to absorb CO2; kept connected for several days.
- Repeats: two sampling cycles per growing season, using the same sieve by late July/Aug and again by late August/early September.
- PROBE CO2: zeolite sieve connected to the probe to collect CO2 via passive diffusion.

## CH4 Sampling and Processing
- In-field monitoring: Detecto Pak-Infrared CH4 analyser used to track CH4 concentration in chamber headspaces (DEEP/BOTTOM).
- Gas capture: CH4 transferred to 10 L foil gas bags for laboratory processing.
- PROBE CH4: soil water drawn from the probe, degassed into the headspace of a 10 L gas bag.
- Lab processing (Garnett et al., 2012 protocol): CO2 removed first; CH4 combusted to CO2 and trapped on zeolite Type 13X.

## Laboratory Analysis
- Sieves (zeolite Type 13X) shipped to NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride, UK) for graphitization and 14C analysis by AMS.
- Data coding: each sample has a Publication_code.
- Output units: radiocarbon enrichment expressed as percent modern carbon.
- Age reporting: conventional radiocarbon age in years BP (before present, defined as AD 1950).

## Data Products and Provenance
- Data provide 14C enrichment for soil-respired CO2 and CH4 across multiple site types and habitats.
- Replicates and sample types (DEEP, BOTTOM, PROBE) enable depth- and habitat-specific analyses.
- Provenance includes sampling years, locations, methodologies, and links to the Garnett et al. 2012 CH4 protocol for context.

## Key Data Considerations for Use
- Comparison across gas types (CO2 vs CH4) and habitats (peatlands vs forests) requires harmonization of depths, sampling dates, and vegetation treatment differences.
- Vegetation clipping applied only to CO2 sampling; CH4 sampling reflects natural vegetation transport pathways.
- Data expressed as percent modern carbon; ages reported as BP, enabling cross-site temporal interpretation when combined with other radiocarbon datasets.
- Methodological details (soda lime CO2 removal, zeolite absorption, and AMS processing) inform data quality assessments and reproducibility.
