# MERLEWOOD RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PAPER No 91 A PRELIMINARY VISUAL PRESENTATION OF LAND CLASSES IN BRITAIN

## Overview
- Presents a visual representation for Britain’s land classes as a supplement to quantitative descriptions.
- Builds on a 32-land-class framework designed to describe ecological and land-use characteristics across Great Britain.
- Aims to convey landscape character visually to aid understanding, planning, and assessment of land-use changes.

## Land Classification System ( What and Why )
- Based on Bunce et al. (1981) methodology to identify primary and subsidiary landscape trends from map information, defining relatively homogeneous land classes.
- Each land class can be described by measurable features (land form, topography, landscape, land use, soils, vegetation).
- The GB classification and survey data cover area, distribution, and characteristics of each class; field sampling adds depth (plants, soils, land uses).
- Identified 32 land classes across Great Britain, with distribution data and field-defined enhancements to support county/regional analysis, productivity assessment, and change monitoring.

## Visual Presentation Approach
- Visual interpretation is essential to complement descriptive data, aiding understanding of composition and potential future landscape changes.
- Introduces a collage-based representation for each land class to convey the class’s typical landscape while avoiding overemphasis on unique features.
- Two primary information sources for each class:
  - Three representative photographs.
  - Mean values and descriptions from Merlewood Research and Development Paper No. 86.
- Process involves creating rough sketches that are iteratively refined to produce an idealized, representative impression for each class (acknowledging some classes may be difficult to represent due to variability, e.g., wholly forested vs wholly open).

## Applications and Uses
- Describes how the GB land classes and survey information are used to:
  - Provide current ecological and land-use characteristics for counties or regions.
  - Support more detailed future surveys.
  - Assess potential productivity across areas.
  - Monitor and predict changes in land use.
- The visual representations support assessment of landscape consequences of future land-use changes.
- Example applications include scenarios for wood-energy plantation development using basic landscapes from selected land classes.

## Context and Methodological Background
- Landscape evaluation has evolved through several approaches and debates (objective vs. judgment-based methods).
- Notable prior methods and studies cited include:
  - Linton’s landform-based classification.
  - Coventry-Solihull-Warwickshire statistical landscape components.
  - Tandy’s landscape elements approach.
  - Robinson et al.’s landscape evaluation project (1970–75) with regression and factor analysis.
- The current paper aligns with an objective framework for describing landscape types while recognizing the ongoing role of visual interpretation.

## Representative Land Class Characteristics (Illustrative Scope)
- The document provides detailed entries for numerous land classes, covering:
  - Geographies: southern England, Wales, Scotland, and combinations thereof.
  - Land forms: from alluvial plains and coastal flats to uplands, plateaux, and moorlands.
  - Topography: ranges from flat to gently rolling to steep hillsides (at various altitudes).
  - Landscapes: open lowlands, enclosed farmland, moorland, coastlines, river valleys, and mixed landscapes.
  - Land use: predominantly arable crops, cereals, pasture, grasses, and urban or cropland interfaces.
  - Soils: brown earths, gleys, podsols, peats, and related upland soil types.
  - Vegetation: varied grasslands, moorlands, sparse to extensive vegetation, and some heavily vegetated or treed areas.
- Examples of class groupings include coastal, upland, lowland plains, river valley complexes, floodplains, peat and moorland regions, and mixed-use inland landscapes.

## Data and Access Notes
- The classification and survey data underpin county-level and regional assessments.
- Visual representations are designed to complement the quantitative descriptions for broader audiences and planning decisions.
- Some land classes exhibit high variability, making idealized visual depiction challenging.
