# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy and how the ITE Land Classification has evolved to stratify a national ecological survey of Great Britain.
  - Emphasizes the link between classification, sampling, and producing map-based data products for estimating and tracking habitat change over time.
  - Highlights the enduring need to align sampling with devolution and country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales-only reports).

- Core concept: stratified sampling using the ITE Land Classification
  - Early use (1978) established a stratified, random sampling framework to ensure samples represent different land types.
  - Stratification reduces bias inherent in purely random sampling by ensuring all important land-use/ecological types are represented.
  - The Land Classification uses environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to define distinct land classes.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling (key milestones)
  - 1978 – Initial Land Classification
    - 32 classes derived from 1228 center 1-km squares; four surrounding squares also classified (total 6039 km squares).
    - Sampling: eight 1-km squares per class (256 total) for field survey of vegetation, soils, habitats.
  - 1984 – Land Use survey
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); focus shifted to land use and habitat mapping.
  - 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
    - Land classification extended to classify every 1-km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - First Land Cover Map of GB linked to the programme; results published using the new framework.
    - Class mappings from original 1228 squares to the new all-squares framework showed partial rearrangements; non-exact matches generally fell into neighboring classes.
  - 1998 – Revised Land Classification for CS1990 results (CS1990 reporting)
    - Classification broadened to 40 classes to support regional and local estimates; UK-wide reporting retained via the updated framework.
  - 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
    - Introduction of separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) to meet policy/legislation needs.
    - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions; class aggregation where necessary; minimum representation requirements increased (minimum of 6 squares per new class).
    - 19 additional squares added; adjustments also addressed Wales-dominant Land Class 17; Isle of Man squares replaced for country-unit reporting.
    - An uplands module added to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.
  - 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further Welsh-specific class subdivisions (creating 5 new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Resulted in 45 strata; 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation; some English classes reduced due to Welsh additions.
    - Provided England, Wales, and Scotland maps reflecting revised Land Classes and sampling framework.

- Country-based reporting and uplands
  - England & Wales and Scotland reporting were separated; class maps and sample allocations were adjusted to support country-specific estimates.
  - Upland habitat estimates were enhanced by an additional 30 squares placed in upland Land Classes in England and Wales.

- Outputs, data products, and GIS implications
  - Detailed Land Classification maps and a structured sampling framework enabling geographicly explicit estimates of habitat areas.
  - Enables Wales-only, Scotland-only, and England & Wales-wide reporting, supporting policy and environmental monitoring.
  - Provides a framework for estimating change over time by comparing consistent class-based sampling designs across surveys.
  - Addresses data challenges relevant to GIS: geographic stratification, class representation across countries, and time-series consistency.

- Note on national estimates and consistency
  - Changing the classification used for national estimates affects stock consistency; two approaches are discussed:
    - Use the latest country-specific classification for country estimates (preferred for CS2000-CS2007 reporting).
    - Use the original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency.
  - Table 4 (not reproduced here) compares sample sizes per class across surveys using the original classification.

- Practical takeaways for GIS specialists
  - The Sampling Strategy demonstrates how to construct a reproducible, stratified sampling framework tied to a multivariate land classification for national-scale GIS analyses.
  - It provides a blueprint for creating country-specific GIS outputs (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales-only) and for integrating upland modules into spatial datasets.
  - Emphasizes the importance of data harmonization over time when classifications evolve, to maintain meaningful time-series comparisons for map-based storytelling and policy guidance.
