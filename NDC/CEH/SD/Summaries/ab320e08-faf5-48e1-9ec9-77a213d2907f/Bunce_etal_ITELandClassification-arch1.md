# ITE LAND CLASSIFICATION: CLASSIFICATION OF ALL SQUARES IN GB

- Aim and scope
  - Classify every 1 km square in Great Britain into land classes, reproducing the original classification where possible.
  - Use automated, machine-readable data to cover all squares and enable broad applicability and reuse.
  - Preserve confidence in the original classification due to extensive prior use and existing databases.

- Data and data structure
  - Data requirements: need comprehensive, square-based data available across GB; detailed field data impractical for all squares.
  - Data categories used for classification:
    - COASTAL: coastal cliff, rock, sand, mud, shingle, tidal
    - ALTITUDE: hill/valley heights, distances, gradients, mean altitude, aspect
    - MAPDATA: OS-derived layers (coastlines, woodland, villages, roads, canals, water bodies, towns, railways, etc.)
    - DISTANCE: distance to south and west coasts
    - ISLAND: island indicators
    - CLIMATE: sunshine, snow days, January minima
    - GEOLOGY: lithology and rock types
    - DRIFT: glacial and related deposits
  - Data sources and scale: used digitised map data (OS), 1:250,000 data, MOD 100 m DTM for altitude, and other land cover attributes; aims to be usable across GB with standardized units.

- Methodological approaches explored (the middle)
  - Initial approach: attempt to reproduce ISA (Indicator Analysis) using a detailed data set; practical challenges due to data balance and scale.
  - Multivariate techniques tested:
    - Discriminant Function analysis
    - Logistic Regression (and combinations with discriminant methods)
    - Other multivariate algorithms (tested but not adopted)
    - Simulation/ordination approaches
  - Evaluation criteria used
    - Geographical distribution of squares within each class
    - Class dispersion, means, and standard errors of variables
    - Agreement with the original 1,212-squares classification
    - Proportions of squares in each class GB-wide
    - Relationship to the principal environmental gradient and its variability
    - Proportion of field-sampled squares over time
    - Efficiency in predicting areas and cover features
    - Ecological characteristics across data sets
  - Key results from comparisons
    - Discriminant Function alone failed to capture coastal classes (7 & 8) in the south and extended class 25 into southern Britain; would require redefining coastal classes and class extents.
    - Logistic Regression and combinations (Logistic/Discriminant) offered tighter clustering and better alignment with the original gradient, though some regional divergences remained.
    - An expanded indicator-based approach (4800 squares with 76 attributes) showed significant divergences from the original, underscoring the value of the more integrated Logistic/Discriminant approach.
    - Cross-tabulations and gradient correlations showed Logistic/Discriminant provided closer correspondence to the original classification than other methods.

- Findings and conclusions (end)
  - Overall assessment
    - The Logistic Regression with Discriminant (Logistic/Discriminant) approach provided the best balance between accuracy, regional applicability, and alignment with the original classification, while reducing dispersion and error relative to the original.
    - Discriminant Function alone was problematic for coastal classes and certain regional extents, necessitating redefinition of some classes.
  - Recommendations
    - Adopt Logistic/Discriminant as the recommended method for classifying all GB squares.
    - Justifications:
      - It best identified coastal classes without requiring major redefinitions of existing classes.
      - Sampling balance was closer to proportional to stratum size, improving representativeness.
      - Lower standard errors and less dispersion compared to the original, with improvements over the 4800-indicator approach.
      - Produces more stable, policy-relevant dispersion characteristics, suitable for land-use planning and environmental policy.
  - Outputs and outputs validation
    - Produced distribution maps showing class dispersion and environmental gradients.
    - Generated environmental means and standard errors for key variables (altitude, coast distance, etc.).
    - Assessed correlations with vegetation data and ecological characteristics to validate ecological coherence.
    - Provided ecological summaries for each land class (soil properties, vegetation associations).
    - Availability of outputs: maps and classifications (original 32 ISA classes, original 1212 squares plus 4800 indicator-sample squares, and full-square classifications trained via the discriminant function) available on request.
  - Implications for future work
    - The established framework enables broader applications in land-use planning and environmental analysis, with a dataset suitable for integration with remote sensing and other thematic data sources.
    - Further refinement and expansion possible through linked datasets and metadata portals to improve discoverability and reuse.
