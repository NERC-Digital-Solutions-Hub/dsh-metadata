# A PRELIMINARY VISUAL PRESENTATION OF LAND CLASSES IN BRITAIN

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents a visual representation of land classes in Britain to supplement quantitative descriptions.
  - Identifies 32 land classes with known area and distribution, using them to describe current ecological and land-use characteristics.
  - Aims to support more detailed county/regional surveys, assess potential productivity, monitor changes, and inform land-use planning.

- Data framework and classification
  - Built on an integrated system of land classification developed for site selection and survey design.
  - Based on map analysis to determine primary and subsidiary trends and define relatively homogeneous land classes.
  - Each land class is described by a set of measurable features across multiple components (e.g., land form, topography, landscape, land use, soils, vegetation).

- Data collection and sources
  - Field sampling conducted for each land class to refine characteristics and to estimate distribution of features (plants, soils, land uses).
  - Information drawn from maps to establish trends; supplemented by vegetation/soil data from field surveys.
  - The presentation draws on three representative photographs and the mean values/descriptions from Merlewood RD Paper No. 86 to inform visual portrayals.

- Visual presentation method
  - Translates descriptive land-class information into visual landscapes via collages: combining typical features to express a class’s composition.
  - Attempts to avoid overemphasizing any single feature and to produce representative, generalized impressions of landscapes.
  - Acknowledges difficulties in representing highly variable classes; some classes may be under- or over-represented due to inherent variability (e.g., wholly forested vs. wholly open scenarios).

- Data structure and content
  - Land classes are geographically distributed across Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland) and include diverse landscapes (lowlands, uplands, coasts, moorlands, valleys, plateaus, etc.).
  - Each class encompasses attributes in areas such as:
    - Geography and land form (e.g., undulating lowlands, coastal features, uplands, river valleys)
    - Topography (flat to steep, gradient variations)
    - Landscape character (open, enclosed, hedged/wooded, coastal, moorland)
    - Land use (arable, cereals, grasslands, pasture, urban/built-up areas, mixed uses)
    - Soils (brown earths, gleys, podsols, peats)
    - Vegetation (grassland types, moorland, woodland presence)
  - The classification is intended as an objective framework to describe landscape types while acknowledging some subjective elements in landscape evaluation.

- Applications and use cases
  - Provides a visual companion to the quantitative land-class descriptions for clearer communication to stakeholders.
  - Facilitates planning, environmental information systems, and scenario development (e.g., wood-energy plantation intensities).
  - Supports broader landscape evaluation efforts by offering a standardized, describable framework for comparing landscapes and assessing changes.

- Accessibility and documentation
  - Copies of related landscape scenarios (e.g., wood-energy exploitation) are available on request from the authors.
  - The document and its visual interpretations build on Merlewood RD Paper No. 86 and Bunce et al. (1981, 1982) for users of the land-class method.
  - Merlewood RD Papers carry authors’ opinions and should be cited with preliminary references to the authors.

- Key challenges and limitations
  - Balancing objective data with subjective perception in landscape evaluation.
  - Representing variability within land classes through generalized visual collages.
  - Ensuring comprehensive coverage of all classes given regional and feature variability; some classes may be underrepresented due to variability.
  - Translating complex, multi-attribute classifications into accessible visual formats for diverse users.
