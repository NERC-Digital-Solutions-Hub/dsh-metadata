# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1990)

## Overview
- A shapefile-based land classification dataset for Great Britain, containing 32 Land Classes (LC1990) described across geographic and ecological attributes.
- Produced from Countryside Survey data and intended for analyses of landscape structure, land use, and ecological context at a national scale.

## Data Details
- Format: Shapefile
- Coverage: Great Britain, 32 Land Classes
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system / Projection: British National Grid (OSGB36), Transverse Mercator
- Extent: Great Britain
- Data source rights: Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology
- Columns: LC1990 (ITE Land Class Number, 1990)

## Data Schema
- Primary attribute: LC1990, indicating the Land Class Number (1990)
- Each Land Class entry provides a descriptive profile across multiple thematic areas (see Land Class Descriptions)

## Land Class Descriptions (high-level)
- The 32 Land Classes span a gradient from southern lowland arable and grassland systems to northern and upland moorland, peatlands, and rugged mountain landscapes.
- Thematic attributes per class include:
  - Geography (regional tendencies across Britain)
  - Land form and topography (from alluvial plains and downland to upland plateaux and glaciated terrains)
  - Landscape (typical patterns of hedgerows, fields, coastlines, urban influence)
  - Land use (dominant uses such as cereals, good grassland, arable crops, urban, mixed farming, or rough grazing)
  - Soils (brown earths, gleys, peats, podsols, etc.)
  - Vegetation (ranging from limited vegetation in intensive arable zones to extensive moorland and peatland types)

- Representative grouping (for orientation):
  - Land Classes 1–8: Southern and coastal lowland landscapes with a mix of cereals, pasture, and urban pressures.
  - Land Classes 9–13: Midlands to eastern lowland areas with arable and good grassland, generally declining hedgerows in open landscapes.
  - Land Classes 14–18: Inland and fenland to upland fringe areas, including heavily farmed lowlands and more extensive upland grazing.
  - Land Classes 19–32: Higher altitude and northern landscapes, including uplands, moorlands, peatlands, and sparsely vegetated highland areas with rough grazing or limited arable land.

## Use and Applications
- Provides a standardized framework to classify and map landscape types across Great Britain.
- Useful for:
  - Policy analysis and regional planning
  - Ecological and biodiversity modeling
  - Land-use change detection and trend analysis
  - Input layers for geographic or environmental models requiring landscape context

## Provenance, References, and Documentation

## Notes for Data Support
- This dataset is designed to enable end users to understand landscape context and facilitate self-serve analyses across diverse topics, with careful attention to regional variation, data quality, and transformation needs.
