# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007, built on three decades of development of the ITE Land Classification.
- Aims to monitor environmental change in Great Britain and inform policy decisions, with links to landscape classifications and stratified sampling principles.
- Emphasises maintaining continuity with predecessors while expanding capability for country-specific reporting.

## Core Concepts and Methodology
- Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of land and ecological variation.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to divide GB into land classes; initial 32 classes (1978) evolved to 40 (1990) and 45 (2000/2007) with further country-specific subdivisions.
- Sampling units: 1 km squares across GB; centre square selected within a 15 × 15 km grid, with four surrounding squares also allocated to classes.
- Field data: habitat, vegetation, soils, and landscape features recorded during a single field season per survey; results used to estimate national habitat areas via class-based proportions.
- Data utility: enables national estimates by multiplying mean habitat area per square by land-class area; supports trend analysis over time.

## Development Timeline (Key Milestones)
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & Survey)
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data of 1228 centre 1 km squares; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class).
  - Basis for national estimates established from class proportions.
- 1984 (Second Survey)
  - Sample increased to 12 squares per class (total 384); eight original squares revisited.
  - National estimates calculated with the 1978 Land Classification; insights published in Landscape Changes in Britain.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification updated to classify all 1 km squares, with urban/sea corrections.
  - 508 squares surveyed; full replication of 1984 features plus repeat vegetation quadrats.
  - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report; linked first Land Cover Map from satellite imagery.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification & Fourth Survey)
  - Classification extended to allow separate Scottish reporting; land classes increased to 40.
  - 569 squares surveyed; national estimates re-based on the revised classification.
  - Publications detailing accounting for nature and related methods.
- 2007 (Further Developments & Fifth Survey)
  - Wales-specific reporting needs drive adjustments: introduction of country-unit classes (5 new Welsh sub-classes, e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Increase in Wales sampling (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class) and redistribution of some English class representations.
  - Wales-focused and upland modules added to improve country-specific accuracy.
  - Resulting framework supports England & Wales and Scotland with updated class maps and sampling distributions.

## Sampling Design Details
- Sample Size and Allocation
  - 1978: 256 squares (8 per 32 classes).
  - 1984: 384 squares (12 per class, maintaining eight earlier visits).
  - 1990: 508 squares; all GB squares reclassified using all-squares Land Classification.
  - 2000: 569 squares (CS2000) with country-unit adaptations and refined class structure.
  - 2007: 591 squares (CS2007) with expanded Welsh representation and country-unit disaggregation to 45 strata.
- Country Reporting and Subdivisions
  - CS1990 used cross-country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man).
  - CS2000 introduced country-unit reporting (England with Wales; Scotland) by subdividing classes and adding additional squares to ensure representation.
  - Wales-specific class subdivisions created in CS2007 (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to enhance Wales-only estimates.
- Upland Module
  - CS2000 included an uplands module adding 30 squares in upland/marginal upland land classes to improve accuracy for highland habitats in England and Wales.
- National Estimates and Consistency
  - The 2006 scoping study notes that shifting classifications affects cross-survey comparability; two approaches considered: latest country-specific classification vs original 1990 classification. Preference for using the latest classification for internal survey consistency, with cross-survey consistency considerations noted.

## Outputs, Representativeness, and Data Considerations
- Outputs include land-class maps, stratified square distributions, and national habitat estimates by class and country unit.
- Tables and figures document the number of squares per class, country distribution, and sampling rates across surveys.
- Emphasis on balancing representation across land classes and ensuring adequate samples in each country unit, particularly Wales, while maintaining overall survey efficiency.

## Challenges and Considerations for Monitoring Frameworks
- Representativeness vs. resource constraints: maintaining sufficient sample sizes across an increasing number of classes and country units.
- Data comparability over time: changes in land classification complicate trend analysis; decision on maintaining legacy classifications vs adopting updated schemes.
- Country-specific reporting needs: devolution effects necessitate enhanced Welsh and Scottish representation and sub-classifications.
- Data governance and metadata: regulatory and governance implications for sharing and reusing classification-based data; ensuring transparent documentation of changes across surveys.
- Upland/marginal area coverage: targeted modules required to improve precision for under-sampled habitats.

## Key Takeaways for Authors of Monitoring Frameworks
- Use a robust stratified random sampling design anchored by a comprehensive environmental classification to ensure representative coverage and comparability over time.
- Plan for policy-relevant reporting by enabling country-unit (or region-specific) estimates through class subdivisions and targeted additional sampling.
- Anticipate and document the impact of re-classification on longitudinal analyses; establish strategies for maintaining continuity or clearly signaling breaks in time series.
- Incorporate targeted modules (e.g., upland zones) to address under-sampled or high-importance areas for policy and ecological understanding.
- Maintain rigorous data collection, transformation, and presentation practices to support transparent interpretation and governance, including clear metadata and justification for sampling decisions.
