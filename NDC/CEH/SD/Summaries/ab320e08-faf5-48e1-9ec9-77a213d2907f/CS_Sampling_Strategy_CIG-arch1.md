# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The document outlines the sampling framework and evolving land classification system (ITE Land Classification) used for the Countryside Survey (CS) field surveys since 1978.
- It links the sampling design to the broader goal of tracking ecological change across Great Britain and providing policy-relevant habitat estimates.

## Key concepts and approach

- Stratified, random sampling to ensure samples represent different land types and ecological processes.
- ITE Land Classification used as the stratification framework to divide GB into discrete classes (land classes) that capture environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate).
- Early approach used 1 km squares as sampling units; stratification reduced bias and improved comparability across time.

## Development and application of the ITE Land Classification

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid.
  - Surrounding four squares per center were classified as well, yielding 6,039 km^2 of classified squares.
  - Surveyed 8 km squares per land class (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas.
  - National estimates calculated as the mean habitat per square in each class multiplied by the area of that class.

- 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
  - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384 squares), still using the 1978 Land Classification for estimates.
  - Aimed to improve precision of change statistics between 1978 and 1984.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated measurements of vegetational data; addition of first Land Cover Map linkage.
  - Results published in CS1990 main report.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification & 4th Field Survey)
  - Classification updated to enable separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
  - 569 squares surveyed; CS1990 framework used for national estimates.

- 2000 (CS2000)
  - Change to support separate country reporting (England with Wales, Scotland) using country-specific estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; aggregation applied where necessary within countries.
  - 40 strata expanded to 40–45 via class subdivision and aggregation; additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes.
  - 30 upland squares module introduced to improve upland habitat estimates; separate upland reporting supported via additional sampling.

## Wales-focused adjustments and England/Wales/Scotland framing (CS2007)

- Wales-only reporting requirements led to Wales-specific sampling adjustments:
  - Land Classes subdivided into Wales-specific versions (creating five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - The framework increased to 45 strata; Wales received 43 extra squares to ensure minimum representation (≥ 6 squares per Welsh class).
  - England adjustments maintained adequate sampling despite Welsh expansions; two English classes (5e, 15e) had as few as 4 squares per class.
- The revised Land Class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland are used to guide CS2007 sampling.
- CS2007 summary shows ongoing distribution across classes and countries, with Wales and England/Scotland reporting aligned to country-specific units.

## Uplands module and reporting

- An additional CS2000 uplands module added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland areas of England and Wales.
- This enhanced statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates and supported country-based reporting needs.

## National estimates and methodological notes

- The 2006 scoping study cautioned that changing the basic land classification could affect the consistency of national estimates; using the latest classification is preferred for internal consistency, while older classifications help maintain cross-survey comparability.
- There is a long-standing tension between using a single GB-wide classification versus country-specific classifications for national reporting.
- Tables and figures (referenced in the document) illustrate the class structures, sample distributions, and country-specific sampling frameworks across survey iterations.

## Practical implications for analysts

- The Countryside Survey's sampling framework provides a robust, stratified approach to estimating habitat extent and change over time, essential for policy and environmental monitoring.
- When comparing across CS years, be mindful of changes in land classification (number of classes, country subdivisions) which can affect comparability and national estimates.
- The introduction of Wales- and uplands-focused modules improves precision for those regions and themes, but requires careful alignment when aggregating to national estimates.
