# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1990)

## Data at a glance
- Format: Shapefile
- Extent: Great Britain
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system: British National Grid
- Projection: Transverse Mercator
- Land Classes: 32 (LC1990)
- Purpose: Stratify land by environmental characteristics (climate, altitude, slope)

## What it is
- A GB-wide land classification that divides the landscape into 32 Land Classes (LC1990) based on environmental characteristics.
- Each Land Class comes with descriptive attributes that define typical geography, landform, topography, landscape, land use, soils, and vegetation.
- Related to Countryside Survey work and supporting ecological and landscape analyses.

## Data contents and structure
- Each Land Class (LC1990) is described by:
  - Geography
  - Land form
  - Topography
  - Landscape
  - Land use
  - Soils
  - Vegetation
- The dataset provides a consistent framework for mapping and comparing landscape types across Great Britain.
- Supplemental references document sampling strategies and classification development (e.g., Barr 1998; Bunce et al.; Howard et al.; Clarke et al.).

## Practical considerations for data leaders
- Data governance and integration
  - Useful as a baseline historical classification for landscape and land-use analyses.
  - Can be integrated with other Countryside Survey data and environmental datasets.
- Data quality and currency
  - Based on 1990 data; may not reflect recent landscape changes.
  - 1 km resolution limits fine-scale analyses; consider when aligning with higher-resolution layers.
- Metadata and accessibility
  - Shapefile format with clear LC1990 coding; documented projection and coordinate system (OSGB36).
  - Comprehensive documentation available via supporting literature and methodological references.
- Data stewardship challenges
  - Ensure alignment with current datasets and coordinate systems when integrating into modern data systems.
  - Maintain awareness of data age and potential need for updating or reclassification in future projects.

## Representative Land Classes (illustrative examples)
- Land Class 1
  - Geography: S. Wales, S.W. England, S. England
  - Land use: Cereals, good grasslands, limited native vegetation
- Land Class 9

  - Land use: Mixture of good grass and arable with many urban areas
- Land Class 25
  - Geography: N.E. England, S.E., C. and N.E. Scotland
  - Land use: Alluvial flood plains and moraines; mainly barley with good grassland
- Land Class 32
  - Geography: NW Scotland and Isles
  - Land use: Open range grazing with some pasture
