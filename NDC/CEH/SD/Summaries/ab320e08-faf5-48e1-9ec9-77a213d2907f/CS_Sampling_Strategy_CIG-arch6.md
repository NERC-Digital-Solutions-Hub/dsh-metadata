# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Describes the sampling framework for Countryside Survey field surveys and how it evolved from the ITE Land Classification over three decades.
  - Emphasises linkage between sampling and the ITE Land Classification to stratify GB land for ecological surveying and national estimates.
  - Aims to understand change over time by maintaining a consistent, yet adaptable, sampling framework.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling: to ensure representativeness and reduce bias in a large, heterogeneous landscape.
  - Land Classification as the stratification basis: uses environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to define land classes that partition GB for sampling.
  - 1 km square sample unit: chosen for balance between ecological detail and practical survey effort.
  - Use of ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) and later refinements to classify squares and describe land classes.

- Development timeline and key changes
  - 1978 (CS1978): First GB ecological survey using 32 ITE Land Classes derived from 1228 centre 1 km squares; eight samples per class (total 256) were surveyed; surrounding four squares per centre square also classified; national estimates computed as mean habitat area per class times area of the class.
  - 1984 (CS1984): Second field survey; 12 km squares per land class (total 384); national estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 (CS1990): All-squares Land Classification revision; 508 squares surveyed; Land Classification updated to incorporate data from all GB squares; first link to Land Cover Map of GB; national estimates now tied to the new, more comprehensive classification.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Major updates to enable Scotland and England & Wales reporting; Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; sub-division and aggregation introduced to create country-unit versions; additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new classes; uplands module added to improve habitat estimates in upland regions.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Welsh-only reporting requirements prompted further adjustments; Wales gains dedicated country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an increased Welsh sample; overall 45 strata; additional Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation; England adjustments accounted for reduced Welsh sampling; Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country unit.

- Country estimates and sampling design
  - CS2000 introduced separate country-unit estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland); class subdivisions and aggregations create 40 strata (later adjusted to 45 in CS2007).
  - Additional samples added to improve representation of new classes in each country, with adjustments to maintain comparable sampling rates between England & Wales and Scotland.
  - Wales-specific adjustments in CS2007 increased Welsh sampling depth for robust Wales-only reporting.

- Upland sampling module
  - An additional module funded in CS2000 added 30 upland squares to improve statistical accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- National estimates and consistency
  - Acknowledges that changing the Land Classification affects the consistency of national estimates across surveys.
  - Recommends using the latest classification for internal estimates, while older classifications may be used for cross-survey consistency when needed.

- Outputs and representations
  - Land Classification maps and revised sampling frameworks provided for England with Wales and Scotland (and later Wales-only frameworks) to guide sampling and reporting.
  - The strategy underpins main Countryside Survey reports and country-specific environmental policy reporting.

- Acknowledgements and sources
  - Credits to contributors and references detailing the development and application of the ITE Land Classification and its use in Countryside Survey.
  - Includes historical context, methodological evolutions, and links to published main reports (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) and supporting literature.

- Bottom-line takeaway
  - The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey documents a progressive, data-driven evolution from a basic 32-class stratification to a nuanced, country-specific, multi-class framework with upland components, designed to produce robust national and regional habitat estimates while accommodating changing policy and devolution requirements.
