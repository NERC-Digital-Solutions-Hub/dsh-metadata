# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1990)

## Overview
- A GB-wide land classification dataset at 1 km resolution, comprising 32 Land Classes that describe major environmental and land-use types.
- Based on data from Countryside Survey (ITE/CEH/NERC) and intended for consistent environmental health and policy performance monitoring over time.
- Each Land Class is defined by its geography, landform, topography, landscape, land use, soils, and vegetation.

## Data format and structure
- Format: Shapefile
- Attribute column: LC1990 – ITE Land Class Number (1990)
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system / projection: British National Grid OSGB1936, Transverse Mercator
- Extent: Great Britain

## Geographic coverage and classification scheme
- Geography: Great Britain (including England, Wales, Scotland)
- Land Classes: 32 distinct classes (labeled Land Class One through Land Class Thirty-Two)
- Each Land Class provides a descriptive, standardized snapshot of its regionally characteristic combination of landscape and land-use features.

## Content structure for each Land Class
- Each Land Class entry includes:
  - Geography
  - Land form
  - Topography
  - Landscape
  - Land use
  - Soils
  - Vegetation
- Descriptions collectively cover a wide range of environments from lowland arable and pasture to upland moorland, coastal margins, flood plains, fens, and mountainous regions.
- The descriptions are designed to support consistent categorization and comparison across time and space.

## Provenance, references, and supporting material
- Source and background: Countryside Survey data (ITE/CEH/NERC)

- Additional supporting documentation includes visual presentations, regional sampling considerations, and methodological validity studies.

## Use and relevance for environmental monitoring
- Enables standardized categorization of environmental conditions and land-use patterns across Great Britain.
- Facilitates cross-time and cross-region comparisons to assess environmental health, landscape structure, and policy performance.
- Outputs can be integrated into maps, reports, and charts; datasets are stored/uploaded to appropriate portals for accessibility.
- Aligns with common monitoring workflows: data verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation to produce comparable outputs.

## Practical considerations for Analysts
- The dataset provides a foundational GB baseline (1990) for land classification, useful for trend analysis when combined with subsequent classifications or time-series data.
- Ideal for linking with ancillary environmental datasets to enhance value (e.g., hedgerow presence, urban encroachment, arable vs. pasture dynamics).
- When applying the Land Classes, consider data age and compatibility with newer classification schemes or time-specific updates.
