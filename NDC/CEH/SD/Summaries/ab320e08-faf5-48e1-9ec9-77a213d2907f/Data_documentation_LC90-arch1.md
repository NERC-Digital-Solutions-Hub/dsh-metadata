# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1990)

- A shapefile-based dataset that defines 32 land classes (Land Class ONE to THIRTY-TWO) across Great Britain, each described by standardized geographic and land-use characteristics.

## Data specifications

- Format: Shapefile
- Content: 32 Land Class areas covering Great Britain
- Attribute: LC1990 (ITE Land Class Number, 1990)
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system: British National Grid (OSGB36)
- Projection: Transverse Mercator
- Extent: Great Britain
- Source: Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology
- Purpose: Provide a consistent framework for interpreting land cover, landscape form, and associated ecological and agricultural characteristics across GB

## Coverage and structure

- The file aggregates GB landscapes into 32 distinct Land Classes, each with a consistent descriptive structure:
  - Geography
  - Land form
  - Topography
  - Landscape
  - Land use
  - Soils
  - Vegetation
- Classes range from southern lowland and rolling agricultural areas to upland, moorland, and coastal/fragmented landscapes, reflecting gradients in climate, altitude, drainage, hedgerows, and urban influence.

## Notable examples of land-class characteristics

- LAND CLASS ONE
  - Southern lowlands (S. Wales, S.W. England, S. England)
  - Alluvial plains/low relief, rolling to flat
  - Mixed lowland agriculture with cereals and limited native vegetation
  - Soils mainly brown earths; vegetation limited
- LAND CLASS NINE to TWELVE (northern/ eastern lowlands)
  - N. Midlands, N.E. England, S.E. Scotland
  - Open lowlands with intensive agriculture and declining hedgerows
  - Mixtures of arable and good grassland; soils include brown earths and gleys
- LAND CLASS NINETEEN to TWENTY-FIVE (upland and river-floodplain contexts)
  - N. England and S. Scotland uplands; rough grazing and moorland
  - Soils frequently peaty or gleys; vegetation moorland or rough grassland
  - Landscape includes open upland and derelict hedgerows, urban influence in some lowlands
- LAND CLASS THIRTY to THIRTY-TWO (extreme northern and island contexts)
  - N. Scotland and Isles; windswept coasts and rugged uplands
  - Open range grazing, crofting, peatland/moss vegetation
  - Soils include peats, podsols, brown earths

## Data usage and considerations for analysts

- Purposeful mapping of landscape types to support ecological, agricultural, and planning analyses
- Enables cross-study comparability by providing a consistent GB-wide land-class framework
- Data integration considerations
  - Aligning with other datasets at compatible scales and projections
  - Understanding the 1 km resolution when analyzing fine-scale patterns
  - Variability in data quality and detail across classes and regions
- Documentation and provenance
  - Supported by extensive reading material and publications detailing sampling strategies and validation (see references)
