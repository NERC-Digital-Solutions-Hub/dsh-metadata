# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1990) Document Version: 1: 7-9-2012

- Overview and purpose
  - Provides a standardized land classification system for Great Britain comprising 32 Land Classes.
  - Used in Countryside Survey work and intended to support environmental health monitoring, policy scrutiny, and informing future decisions.
  - Data intended to help monitor changes in land use, landscape structure, and associated ecological considerations across GB.

- Data specifications
  - Format: Shapefile
  - Extent: Great Britain
  - Resolution: 1 km
  - Coordinate system/Projection: British National Grid (OSGB36), Transverse Mercator
  - Dataset scope: Each Land Class (LC1990) is defined by a unique number (1–32) with descriptive characteristics

- Content structure
  - 32 Land Classes (LC1990 1–32)
  - For each Land Class, detailed descriptions cover:
    - Geography (where the class occurs)
    - Land form (topographic characteristics)
    - Topography (altitude and slope tendencies)
    - Landscape (typical landscape features)
    - Land use (dominant activities, e.g., arable, grassland, urban)
    - Soils (dominant soil types)
    - Vegetation (typical vegetation or cover)
  - The classifications span a broad range of GB environments, from lowland arable and mixed farmland to upland moorland, coastal zones, fens, and glaciated uplands.

- Supporting literature and context
  - Further reading and methodological references related to the Countryside Survey and land classification development, including:
    - Barr (1998) and its 2011 revision on the Countryside Survey sampling strategy
    - Early visual presentations and subsequent classifications for GB land squares
    - Papers detailing land classification for strategic ecological surveys and GB-wide validation
    - Wales-specific sampling groundwork (CS2007 Preparation Phase II)
  - These references provide methodological foundations for data collection, sampling design, and the validity of using GB land classifications in monitoring.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Offers a consistent categorization scheme to derive indicators of land cover, land use change, habitat structure, and landscape fragmentation.
  - Facilitates cross-comparison over time and across regions within GB, aiding policy evaluation and scenario analysis.
  - Supports data governance efforts by embedding metadata-friendly structure (class definitions, provenance, and documentation) and by highlighting data origin (Countryside Survey data © NERC – Centre for Ecology & Hydrology).

- Practical considerations for use
  - Based on historical data (1990 classification); consider temporal relevance and potential updates or crosswalks with modern schemes for current monitoring.
  - The 1 km resolution provides generalized classifications suitable for regional assessments but may limit fine-scale analyses.
  - Metadata quality and completeness are important for verifying applicability to specific monitoring questions.
