# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1990)

## Overview
- A shapefile-based dataset containing 32 distinct Land Classes for Great Britain, stratified by environmental characteristics (climate, altitude, slope) to represent land surface types.
- Dataset is associated with Countryside Survey data from ITE/CEH and is presented with detailed contextual references.

## Dataset Details
- Format: Shapefile
- Coverage: 32 Land Class areas across Great Britain
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system/Projection: British National Grid (OSGB36), Transverse Mercator
- Extent: Great Britain
- Primary attribute: LC1990 – ITE Land Class Number (1990)
- Ownership/Copyright: Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology and Hydrology
- Supporting documentation: Extensive list of historical references and reports related to land classification and sampling strategies

## Data Schema and Content
- Land Class structure: Land Class numbers are labeled ONE through THIRTY-TWO, each representing a distinct classification unit defined by geography, land form, topography, landscape, land use, soils, and vegetation.
- For each Land Class, the dataset provides narrative descriptions that cover:
  - Geography and land form
  - Topography
  - Landscape
  - Land use
  - Soils
  - Vegetation
- Example scope: Classifications cover a wide range of GB environments, from southern lowlands and coasts to uplands, fens, moorlands, and mountainous regions, reflecting variations in agriculture, urbanization, natural features, and soil types.

## Geographic Coverage and Spatial Details
- Geographic reach: Great Britain
- The 32 Land Classes collectively describe spatially discrete units at 1 km resolution, suitable for regional analyses and landscape-level classification studies.
- Use of the dataset supports regional comparisons, historical land-cover interpretation, and integration with Countryside Survey results and ecological studies.

## Data Provenance, Documentation, and References
- Primary source: Countryside Survey data (ITE/CEH)
- Key references and supporting documents include:
  - Barr (1998); Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey
  - Wood (2011); Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)
  - Early visual presentations and classifications (1982)
  - Series of papers detailing land classification for various GB regions and validation studies (1991–2006)
  - Wales-only and Scotland-related sampling and preparation materials (various years)
- Additional context: The dataset is accompanied by extensive scholarly literature detailing methodology, validation, and applications in land cover estimation.

## Data Quality and Governance Considerations for Data Stewards
- Metadata and provenance:
  - Ensure LC1990 field is consistently applied and documented
  - Include full citation of all supporting references and the 1990 classification framework
- Standardization:
  - Maintain consistent naming (ONE to THIRTY-TWO) and ensure alignment with the 1 km resolution and GB extent
  - Preserve coordinate system (OSGB36) and projection (Transverse Mercator) in all distributions
- Interoperability and updates:
  - Track any revisions or reclassifications and document update history
  - Consider integrating with related Countryside Survey outputs and regional studies
- Data availability and access control:
  - Respect copyright and licensing (Countryside Survey data © NERC - CEH)
  - Provide clear licensing, usage rights, and attribution requirements
- Usability considerations:
  - Provide detailed metadata describing each Land Class’s geography, landform, topography, landscape, land use, soils, and vegetation
  - Consider publishing a concise legend or lookup table mapping LC1990 values to descriptive class summaries for user accessibility

## Licensing, Access, and Use
- Rights: Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology and Hydrology
- Documentation: Extensive supporting literature and methodological references available for deeper understanding and reproducibility
- Practical use: Suitable for landscape-scale analyses, historical land classification research, and integration with ecological and environmental studies across GB

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- When disseminating or archiving:
  - Preserve 1 km resolution and OSGB36 projection
  - Include LC1990 attribute and the comprehensive Land Class narratives
  - Attach or reference the supporting bibliography and methodological documentation
- For end users:
  - Provide clear guidance on interpreting Land Class ONE to THIRTY-TWO
  - Highlight limitations related to historical methodology and potential regional applicability
  - Indicate how this classification relates to other Countryside Survey products and land-cover datasets
