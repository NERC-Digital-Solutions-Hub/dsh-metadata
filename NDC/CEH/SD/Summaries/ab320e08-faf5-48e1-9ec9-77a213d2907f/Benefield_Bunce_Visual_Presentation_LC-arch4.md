# A PRELIMINARY VISUAL PRESENTATION OF LAND CLASSES IN BRITAIN

## Executive summary
- Presents a visual representation framework for Britain’s landscape by classifying land into 32 land classes, each defined by measurable features (land form, topography, landscape, land use, soils, vegetation, geography).
- Builds on an integrated land-classification system and supplements quantitative descriptions with visual interpretations to convey landscape character and potential future changes.
- Aims to support county-level descriptions, assessment of productivity, monitoring, and planning, including scenarios for wood-energy plantations.
- Recognizes the gap between objective data and subjective perception of landscape and uses a collage approach to visualize typical class characteristics.

## Data framework and classification
- Identified 32 land classes across Great Britain; areas and distributions are known from classification work.
- Land classes described by a series of measurable features enabling consistent comparison and description of vegetation, soils, and land uses.
- Data foundation combines map-based analysis of primary and subsidiary trends with field surveys to refine characteristics.
- The framework supports description of landscape types and provides structure for describing ranges of landscapes for current and future use.

## Methods and data sources
- Context: reviews of landscape evaluation methods and developments since 1930, with emphasis on objective approaches and the role of judgement.
- Key methodological references cited include Linton (landform-based classification), Coventry-Solihull-Warwickshire statistical landscape components, and Tandy’s landscape elements approach; comparative critiques by Blacksell & Gilg and Liddle.
- Compared and integrated approaches from government studies (e.g., DoE Central Study, Scotland’s Scenic Heritage) and later Robinson et al. (landscape evaluation project) to inform the methodology.
- Primary data collection includes field sampling of land classes and compilation of descriptive information on vegetation, soils, and land uses.

## Visual presentation approach
- Translates descriptive land-class descriptions into visual form to communicate landscape character.
- Moves beyond single photographs by creating collages that combine typical features for each land class, using:
  - Three representative photographs per class.
  - Mean values and descriptions from Merlewood R&D Paper No. 86.
- Attempts to avoid overemphasizing any single feature; acknowledges some classes are difficult to represent due to high variability (e.g., wholly forested vs wholly open).

## Uses and applications
- Provides an objective framework for describing British landscapes, analogous to earlier efforts like Dudley Stamp’s Britain’s Structure and Scenery.
- Supports broader ecological and land-use characterizations, county-level surveys, and planning processes.
- Facilitates assessment of potential productivity and monitoring of changes in land use.
- Used to develop scenarios for land exploitation, including six land classes used to model different intensities of wood-energy plantation scenarios.

## Challenges and considerations for data leaders
- Balancing objective data with subjective perceptions of landscape (“what is there” vs “what I like”).
- Data fragmentation and scattered availability of data across regions, complicating overview and coordination.
- Variability within land classes makes some representations challenging.
- Limited adoption of fully objective, statistically rigorous methods at the time; reliance on judgement in several landscape-evaluation exercises.

## Implementation and access
- This visual presentation complements Merlewood Research and Development Paper No. 86 and contributes to ongoing development of landscape interpretation.
