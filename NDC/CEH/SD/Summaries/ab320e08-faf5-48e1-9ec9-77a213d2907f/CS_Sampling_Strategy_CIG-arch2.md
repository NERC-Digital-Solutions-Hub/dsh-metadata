# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview and purpose
- Documents the evolution of the sampling strategy for Countryside Survey fieldwork, tied to the ITE Land Classification.
- Aims to maintain a time-series framework that allows monitoring of environmental condition and policy performance over time.
- Emphasizes the link between sampling design, data classification, and national estimates.

## Core concepts and methodology
- Stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage and reduce bias.
- ITE Land Classification as the stratification framework:
  - Initial 32 land classes (developed in the mid-1970s) based on environmental attributes.
  - Progressive expansion to better represent regional differences (ultimately 40, then 45 classes by 2007).
- Sampling units:
  - 1 km square sample units chosen within classified land classes.
  - Early surveys used centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; surrounding squares allocated to classes.
- Data handling and outputs:
  - Field data gathered per square; estimates of habitat areas derived from class proportions and square counts.
  - Land Class maps and tables accompany outputs; results used to produce national estimates.

## Chronology of the Countryside Survey sampling framework

- 1978 – First Land Classification and field survey
  - 32 Land Classes (ISA-based classification of squares).
  - 8 squares sampled per class (total 256 squares).
  - National habitat-area estimates derived from class proportions and class areas.
- 1984 – Second GB land-use survey
  - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - Continued use of the original 32-class framework.
- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 and All Squares Land Classification
  - Land Classification revised to cover every 1 km square in GB (all-squares approach).
  - 508 squares surveyed; expanded data collection to include repeats of earlier vegetation data.
  - Introduction of the first Land Cover Map linkage to satellite imagery.
- 1998–2000 – Developments leading to CS2000
  - Recognition that the 1990 classification needed refinement to enable regional and local estimates.
  - Best simulation created a revised classification; eight-square-per-class approach adjusted to reflect new distribution.
  - Separate country estimates introduced (England with Wales, Scotland) to improve policy-relevant reporting.
  - Wales gained more explicit representation; new sub-division of classes created to reflect country units.
  - Additional upland module added to CS2000 to improve habitat estimates in uplands (England and Wales).
- 2007 – Developments for CS2007 (Welsh-only reporting)
  - Wales-specific reporting requirements drive further refinements.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating 5 new Welsh/England sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Total strata expanded to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure representation; some English classes reduced to 4 squares each due to overall sampling balance.
  - The revised England-Wales-Scotland framework and sampling map published.

## Sampling framework details and country-level reporting
- Country-unit approach
  - After devolution, need for England with Wales and Scotland-only estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided by country-unit versions; where needed, sparse classes are aggregated with similar ones within a country.
  - Number of squares per class adjusted to ensure minimum representation (e.g., minimum 6 squares per Welsh class post-adjustments).
- Upland module (CS2000)
  - Additional 30 squares allocated to upland and marginal upland land classes in England and Wales to improve precision of upland habitat estimates.
- Wales-focused enhancements (CS2007)
  - Welsh squares increased to strengthen Wales-only reporting; introduction of Wales-specific class subdivisions and an expanded 45-strata framework.
- Data outputs for policy and monitoring
  - Tables and figures provide counts of sampled squares by class and country.
  - Outputs include national estimates of habitat areas, with distinctions by country unit for England & Wales and Scotland.
  - Reference frameworks include CS1990 main report, CS2000 reports, and CS2007 preparation/testing literature.

## Data interpretation, quality, and consistency
- Consistency considerations
  - Changing the underlying Land Classification across surveys affects comparability of national estimates.
  - Two approaches discussed: use latest classification for within-survey consistency or retain 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency. The report prefers the latest classification for consistency within a survey.
- Time-series implications
  - Time-series value preserved by linking survey data to stratification schemes; however, users should be aware of reclassification effects when comparing across years.
- Outputs and accessibility
  - Detailed summaries of squares per class and per country are provided, enabling targeted analysis by region and habitat type.
  - Land classification maps and tabular summaries accompany national and country-level estimates.

## Practical implications for environmental analysts
- The Countryside Survey sampling strategy provides a standardized, stratified framework to monitor habitat change over time.
- Analysts can:
  - Use country-unit stratifications to generate England & Wales or Scotland-specific insights.
  - Compare habitat estimates across survey years, with caveats about classification changes.
  - Combine data with the upland module outputs for more robust upland habitat analyses.
- Data governance context
  - The document emphasizes methodological transparency, explicit classification changes, and notes on consistency when generating national estimates.
