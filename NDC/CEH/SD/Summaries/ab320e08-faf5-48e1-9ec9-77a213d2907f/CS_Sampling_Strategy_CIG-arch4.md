# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) outlines the development and application of the ITE Land Classification to guide field sampling for Countryside Survey across GB, with revisions up to 2011. It situates the 2007 methodology as the latest in a 30-year evolution tied to time-series change detection.

## Core purpose and approach

- Aim: provide a representative, stratified sampling framework to monitor countryside characteristics and habitat change over time.
- Central concept: use the ITE Land Classification to stratify the landscape into land classes, then apply stratified random sampling to select field survey squares.
- Rationale for stratification: reduce bias and ensure samples cover the full variability of Britain’s landscapes, beyond what pure random sampling would achieve.

## The ITE Land Classification: origins and evolution

- Began in the 1970s, expanding from local scale (woodlands) to national scale using 1 km squares as the sampling unit.
- Early method: classify a subset of squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid) with ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) based on environmental attributes; assign surrounding four squares to the same class for a total of 6040 squares classified.
- 32 initial Land Classes described by environmental attributes (altitude, slope, rainfall, etc.).
- 1980s–1990s: National framework expanded and revised to cover all GB squares with surrogate climate/geology/physiography data; 1990 CS used an adjusted classification for national estimates, with some squares moved to neighboring classes.
- 2000: Land Classification expanded to enable separate country reporting (England with Wales, Scotland); class subdivisions and aggregations created 40 strata, plus additional squares to ensure adequate representation.
- 2007: Welsh-specific reporting further refined via country-unit land classes (5 new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); overall 45 strata; additional Welsh squares to maintain representation; upland habitats module added (30 extra squares) for improved upland accuracy.
- Isle of Man samples replaced to maintain country-unit consistency in estimates.

## Survey progression by year and sampling specifics

- CS1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey):
  - 8 squares per Land Class, total 256 squares.
  - 32 classes created from 1228 central squares (plus surrounding squares classified).
- CS1984 (2nd Field Survey):
  - 12 squares per Land Class, total 384 squares.
- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey):
  - All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Introduced Land Cover Map linked to the programme.
- CS2000 (4th Field Survey):
  - Separate country estimates implemented (England with Wales; Scotland).
  - 40 Land Classes; 19 additional squares added for Wales to ensure adequate representation; England-Wales adjustments minimal in some classes.
  - Wales subdivided into country-unit classes; additional class aggregation where needed; Isle of Man samples replaced.
  - Upland module planned to improve upland habitat estimates (30 extra squares).
- CS2007 (5th Field Survey):
  - Wales reporting intensified: 43 additional Welsh squares; 5 new Welsh sub-classes; total of 45 strata retained with expanded representation for Wales.
  - England adjustments limited; two English classes remain with 4 squares each.
  - Revised class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland displayed; Wales-specific and country-unit reporting emphasized.

## Outputs, estimates, and governance

- Estimation approach: for each land class, habitat area is estimated as mean habitat area per square times the total land class area; GB-wide, England & Wales, and Scotland estimates are derived with country-specific sampling.
- Documentation and cross-year comparability:
  - National estimates can be presented using the latest Land Classification (country-specific classifications) or the original 1990 classification; a 2006 scoping study notes trade-offs between consistency and up-to-dateness.
  - Table 4 in the document provides the historical sample sizes per class under the original classification for cross-survey comparability.
- Outputs include maps and tables showing the distribution of sample squares, strata areas, and sampling rates (1:x) across countries and years.

## Implications for data leaders

- Data strategy alignment:
  - Maintain clear versioning and documentation of Land Classification schemes used for each survey year to ensure reproducibility and tractable cross-year comparisons.
  - Preserve mappings between original and revised land classes (crosswalks) to support longitudinal analyses across de facto changing classifications.
- Data architecture and discoverability:
  - Clearly tag data by Land Class version, country unit (England with Wales, Scotland, Wales), and upland modules to enable precise filtering for policy-oriented reporting.
  - Ensure metadata captures sampling design (strata, number of squares per class, sampling rate) for auditability and stakeholder communication.
- Policy and stakeholder alignment:
  - Support Wales-only, Scotland-only, and England-with-Wales reporting needs via country-unit stratifications and explicit class subdivisions.
  - Maintain access to the official outputs (tables, maps, and accompanying methodological notes) to facilitate evidence-based decision-making.
- Data quality and stewardship:
  - Track updates to classification schemes and sampling allocations over time to uphold data quality and comparability.
  - Plan for future revisions (e.g., further devolution or methodological shifts) with explicit impact assessments on national estimates and time-series consistency.
