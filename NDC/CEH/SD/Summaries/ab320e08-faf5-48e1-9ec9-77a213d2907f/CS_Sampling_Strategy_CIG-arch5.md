# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - The document describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007, as the latest in a 30+ year lineage beginning in 1978.
  - It emphasizes that the current methodology is tightly linked to previous surveys and that understanding the evolution is essential for interpreting time-series change.

- Core concept: stratified, representative sampling
  - To avoid bias, samples are taken using objective, stratified random procedures.
  - Stratification is achieved with the ITE Land Classification, which groups land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes.
  - Samples are drawn from 1 km squares, balancing granularity with fieldwork feasibility.
  - A centre square is classified, and surrounding squares (typically four) are also allocated to the same or related classes to capture local variability.

- ITE Land Classification: development and purpose
  - 1978: First version used to stratify GB field sampling; produced 32 land classes from 1 km squares (center) plus surrounding squares.
  - 1984: Land use survey used the same framework, increasing the sample per class to improve national estimates.
  - 1990: Countryside Survey 1990 introduced an “All Squares” Land Classification, incorporating data from every square (1 km) in GB and linking to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1990–2000: Revisions aimed at enabling regional and local estimates; substantial reclassification occurred to maintain representativeness as data density and computing capabilities changed.
  - 2000: CS2000 introduced country-specific estimates (England & Wales, Scotland), subdividing land classes into country-unit versions and aggregating where necessary to maintain balanced representation. Additional upland habitat sampling was added to improve national estimates for upland regions.
  - 2007: CS2007 added Wales-only reporting capabilities. Welsh-specific class subdivisions (creating 5 new Welsh classes) and extra Welsh squares were introduced to improve Wales’ reporting accuracy; England saw adjustments due to Welsh removals. The framework expanded to 45 strata.

- Country-unit and sampling adjustments
  - To produce England & Wales and Scotland-only estimates, land classes were subdivided into country-unit variants, and some rare classes were aggregated within each country.
  - Additional squares were allocated to ensure adequate representation of new or redefined classes in each country unit (e.g., Wales received extra sampling in CS2000 and CS2007).
  - Specific Welsh sub-division (e.g., Land Class 17) was implemented to improve Wales’ estimates.
  - Isle of Man squares were replaced when producing country-unit estimates.

- Upland habitat module
  - CS2000 funded an upland module adding 30 squares in upland/marginal upland areas of England and Wales to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates.

- Sampling numbers and geographic coverage
  - The document provides detailed tables and figures showing the distribution and number of sample squares by class and year, including the transition from combined GB estimates to country-unit estimates.
  - Wales became the most intensively sampled country in CS2000 and CS2007 due to country-specific reporting needs.
  - The overall sampling effort increased through iterations, with explicit counts of squares and strata for England, Scotland, and Wales in each survey cycle.

- Data governance, provenance, and interpretation notes
  - Changes to the Land Classification have implications for the consistency of national estimates across surveys; the document discusses the trade-off between using the latest classification versus maintaining cross-survey consistency.
  - For national estimates, choices exist between applying the latest country-specific classification or the original 1990 classification; the report recommends using the latest for internal consistency, while noting cross-survey comparability concerns.
  - Outputs include main reports, tabular summaries, and maps; cross-survey comparisons require careful attention to classification versioning and sampling design changes.

- Outputs and documentation
  - Key outputs include:
    - Countryside Survey 1990 main report and associated volumes.
    - CS2000 reports documenting country-unit estimates and sampling adjustments.
    - CS2007 preparations and Wales-focused reporting guidance.
  - The document provides extensive references and an historical appendix detailing the evolution of the land classification and sampling framework.
