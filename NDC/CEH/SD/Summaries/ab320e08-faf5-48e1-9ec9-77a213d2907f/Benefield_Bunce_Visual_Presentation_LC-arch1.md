# MERLEWOOD RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PAPER No 91 A PRELIMINARY VISUAL PRESENTATION OF LAND CLASSES IN BRITAIN

## Aim and scope
- Present a visual representation of Britain’s land classes to supplement quantitative descriptions.
- Provide an objective framework for describing the range of British landscapes (32 land classes identified) and support future landscape interpretation and assessment.
- Inform current ecological and land-use characteristics, assist more detailed surveys, and help monitor or predict land-use changes.
- Link to Merlewood R&D Paper No. 86 and broader efforts to translate land-class descriptions into visual landscapes for communication and planning.

## Background and context
- Landscape evaluation has evolved since Victorian times, with significant methodological work reviewed and cited from 1930 onward.
- Three influential approaches highlighted: (1) Linton-type direct classifications of landforms, (2) Coventry-Solihull-Warwickshire measurements of landscape components, and (3) Tandy-style identification and summarization of landscape elements.
- Previous studies often relied on expert judgement; rigorous statistical techniques (e.g., regression, factor analysis) were applied in Robinson et al. (1976) but not widely adopted subsequently.
- The paper emphasizes the ongoing challenge of balancing objective data with subjective landscape appreciation and the value of an objective framework for landscape types.

## Data and land classification
- A unified land-classification system (Bunce et al. 1981) defines 32 land classes for Great Britain.
- Classification process:
  - Map analysis to identify primary and subsidiary trends, producing relatively homogeneous land classes.
  - Field surveys to refine class characteristics, including vegetation, soils, and land uses.
  - Knowledge of area distribution and class-specific features to support regional and county-level descriptions.
- The classification serves as a basis for describing landscapes and for planning and monitoring land-use changes.

## Visual interpretation and presentation
- Previous use of photographs to convey landscape character was limited by the inability to capture an average landscape and the viewer’s attention to unique site features.
- The authors developed a collage-based visual representation for each land class:
  - Built from three representative photographs plus mean values/descriptions from R&D Paper No. 86.
  - Aim to produce idealized compositions that avoid overemphasizing unique features and convey the general character of the class.
  - Acknowledges that some classes, especially highly variable ones (e.g., wholly forested vs. wholly open), are difficult to represent adequately.
- The visual presentations are intended as intuitive, illustrative supplements to the detailed quantitative descriptions.

## Applications and accessibility
- The land classes and their visual representations have been used to:
  - Support assessments of potential productivity and ecological characteristics for specific counties or regions.
  - Develop scenarios of different exploitation intensities for wood-energy plantation planning (as part of Bunce et al. 1981 work).
- Copies and further details can be obtained from the authors.

## Useful considerations and limitations
- The authors identify the central challenge of distinguishing “what is there” from “what is preferred,” underscoring the subjective-objective tension in landscape evaluation.
- While the land-class framework is data-driven, the translation into visual forms introduces interpretation that must be used carefully alongside quantitative data.
- Some land classes with high variability may not be fully or perfectly represented in the visual collages.
- The paper notes that visual interpretations are intended to advance understanding and communication, not replace detailed, data-driven descriptions.
