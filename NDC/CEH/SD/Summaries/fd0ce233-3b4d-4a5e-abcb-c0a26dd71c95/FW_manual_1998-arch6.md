# MODULE 2: SURVEY OF FRESHWATER HABITATS

- Purpose and context
  - NERC Countryside Survey CS2000 module focusing on freshwater habitats.
  - Aims to provide current, compatible data to monitor countryside changes and support policy and conservation outcomes (e.g., biodiversity indicators, habitat classification, and site management).
  - Builds on CS1990 timeseries to assess change and inform government and agencies.

- Sampling framework and planning
  - Survey of freshwater habitats conducted in 1 x 1 km squares; CS1990 used 508 squares; CS2000 adds up to 30 new squares and replacement sites for logistics, with a target of 435 squares for field work.
  - Core sampling elements (conducted by IFE field surveyors from CS2000): aquatic macro-invertebrate survey (RIVPACS-compatible), River Habitat Survey (RHS) including alder disease and chemical data, diatom survey, chironomid pupal exuviae survey, and an ecofact-type macrophyte survey.
  - Re-survey and country-unit estimation: re-sample 1990 squares to maintain timeseries; additional squares (MR) marked on maps to aid country-specific estimates.
  - Standardised field handbook emphasizes consistent procedures to minimise observer variation and improve data quality.

- Field operations and data collection
  - Teams and coordination: field surveyors coordinate with project leaders; prior landowner permission sought; advance notification to landowners; on-site permissions documented if needed.
  - Scheduling: surveys typically undertaken within four weeks of prior teams; planning aims to maintain seasonal consistency across sampling.
  - Equipment and data capture: extensive equipment list (nets, pots, fixatives, GPS, cameras, safety gear, labels, map materials, etc.); dual field roles (Surveyor A for invertebrates and RHS, Surveyor B for RHS and additional sampling).
  - Sampling methodology (macro-invertebrates and environmental data):
    - Macro-invertebrate sampling: three minutes using pond-net, plus one minute of manual search; replicate samples at 10% of sites; samples fixed in 10% formalin; precise labelling and packaging; environmental data collected within the 50 m reach around the sampling site and recorded on the RHS forms.
    - Sample area and habitat coverage: aim to sample habitats proportionally to their cover within the 5–15 m stream-bed sample area; ensure comparability across sites and years.
  - Data handling and labelling: field forms alongside two copies of site maps; unique square codes (land class/square number); sample codes (M for macro-invertebrate site, MR for reserve), and detailed labelling for every container.
  - Environmental and ancillary data: measurement of width, depth, substratum, substrate percent cover, current velocity, and river habitat features; photographs required for re-location and site characterization.
  - Diatoms and pupal exuviae: diatoms collected near the macro-invertebrate site; chironomid pupal exuviae collected to support CPET-based water quality monitoring; formalin preservation and careful labelling and storage.
  - Ecofacts: document macrophyte transects (up to five 10 m x 2 m transects) to record floral composition along river corridors.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS) and SERCON integration
  - RHS procedure: standard 500 m reach centered on the macro-invertebrate sampling site; spot-checks every 50 m across a 1 m channel transect (E and F) and a 10 m bank transect (F and G) for land use and vegetation structure; integration with SERCON (System for Evaluating Rivers for Conservation) for comprehensive conservation assessment.
  - SERCON component: evaluates planform, cross-section changes, bank restoration/revetment recovery, riparian vegetation naturalness, and other features; provides additional scoring alongside RHS data.
  - Documentation: RHS forms (Part Three) plus spot-check keys; training and accreditation required for RHS surveyors; health and safety guidelines and lone-worker procedures included.

- Data management, quality control, and replication
  - Data products: RIVPACS-compatible invertebrate data; RHS-based habitat classification; diatom and chironomid exuviae data; chemical water parameters; 10% replicate sampling for quality control; periodic audits of RHS surveys.
  - Data integrity: strict field labeling, standardized sampling times, and consistent measurement methods to support cross-year comparisons and model predictions.
  - Training and accreditation: RHS surveyors require accredited training; ongoing quality assurance through team rotations and audits.

- Safety, permissions, and field conduct
  - Permissions: acquire landowner consent before surveying; carry identification; follow access protocols; if permission is denied for any part, adjust sampling accordingly.
  - Safety protocols: formaldehyde handling and storage procedures; personal protective equipment (gloves, barrier creams, life jackets where appropriate); lone-worker code of practice; emergency communication plans; access to first aid and eyewash; leptospirosis awareness cards.
  - Field conduct: avoid sampling during spate conditions; ensure lifejackets for high-risk sites; two-person teams recommended; clear procedures for accidents and medical advice.

- Appendices, references, and additional materials
  - Appendix outlines detailed field protocols for macroinvertebrate sampling and RIVPACS data collection, including environmental data collection forms and measurement guidelines.
  - RHS includes extensive forms, spot-check keys, and guidance for banktop land-use, vegetation structure, channel vegetation types, and SERCON integration.
  - Safety and lone-work policies, plus SERCON-specific guidance and reference materials to support conservation assessment.

- End-state and outcomes
  - The CS2000 freshwater module provides a standardized, repeatable data framework across years to assess landscape-scale freshwater habitat change, support policy, and inform conservation actions through robust, comparable datasets and integrated habitat/conservation scoring.
