# Countryside Survey 2000. Module 2: survey of freshwater habitats. Field handbook v.2.0

## Aim and Context
- Use data to demonstrate environmental condition in a consistent format for scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Provide standardized methods and outputs to support monitoring responsibilities and policy development.

## Who It Applies To
- Field teams operating under established environmental monitoring responsibilities.
- Analysts who rely on consistent, comparable datasets and clear outputs (reports, maps, charts).

## Data Sources, Standards and Outputs
- Builds on CS1990 framework; aims for longitudinal datasets enabling trend analysis.
- Core outputs include River Habitat Survey (RHS) forms, RIVPACS macro-invertebrate data, and SERCON assessments; integration with LAND CLASS and OS map data.
- Uses ITE Land Classification System; data captured for 1 x 1 km squares; country-level estimates derived from square data.
- Emphasis on standardised field procedures to minimise observer variation and to ensure compatibility across timeseries.

## Sampling Framework and Timeseries
- CS1990 sampled 508 squares (England, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man); CS2000 plans to re-sample those 508 squares and add 30 new ones (including replacements for Isle of Man and new country-unit squares), totalling 568 potential sites.
- Module 1 (Survey of broad habitats and landscape features) and Module 2 (Survey of freshwater habitats) planned; CS2000 advances include satellite imagery integration and a two-tier ground-truth approach linking top-down and bottom-up data.
- Prioritises standardised procedures, with explicit quality control to maintain timeseries integrity.

## Data Lifecycle and Access
- Data must be verified, quality assured, cleaned, transformed and stored; published outputs include reports, maps and charts.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals; emphasis on enabling access to underlying data to maximise value beyond single-use outputs.

## Field Procedures (High-Level)
- Planning and Site Visits
  - Systematic survey of identified 1 km squares; coordination across ITE laboratories; regular reporting of completed squares and access issues.
- Equipment and Safety
  - Standardised field equipment lists (nets, pots, fixatives, cameras, GPS, PPE); safety protocols, PPE, life jackets, lone-worker procedures.
- Macro-Invertebrate Sampling (RIVPACS)
  - Standard three-minute active pond-net sampling plus one-minute manual search; replicate samples at 10% of sites for quality control.
  - Chemical samples taken upstream of macro-invertebrate sampling; samples fixed in 10% formalin; detailed labeling and storage protocols.
  - Samples stored in grey trays; strict labelling, transport, and protection against contamination.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - 500 m reach, centered on macro-invertebrate sampling site; ten spot-checks at ~50 m intervals; transects across the banktop and channel for land-use, vegetation structure, and channel vegetation types.
  - RHS forms capture broad geomorphology, channel features (riffles, pools, bars), bank materials, and land-use impacts.
  - Additional SERCON component can be collected to assess conservation value; SERCON items I-IX cover planform, recovery, and naturalness of vegetation and banks.
- Diatoms and Chironomid Pupal Exuviae
  - Diatom sampling near macroinvertebrate site; chironomid pupal exuviae sampling for CPET-based water-quality monitoring; both have stipulated field procedures and fixation guidelines.
- Water Chemistry
  - On-site chemical sampling with proper bottle handling, filtration, labeling and chain-of-custody; standardised procedures for sample handling and transport.
- Data Recording and Labelling
  - Rigorous labeling conventions (external labels, replicate identifiers, sample area codes); preserve chain-of-custody and prevent cross-contamination.
- Quality Control
  - Accredited RHS surveyors; routine inter- and intra-operator quality checks; 10% replicate sampling; periodic audits of RHS surveys.

## Data Structures and Metrics
- Sampling Area Definitions
  - Macro-invertebrate sampling area corresponds to the full width of the watercourse over the chosen 50 m/500 m reach, including deeper or inaccessible sections for environmental data.
- Habitat and Substrata Assessments
  - Substratum particle size categories (silt/clay, sand, gravel, cobble, boulders); visual estimates of percent cover; substrate recording supports RIVPACS predictions.
- Channel and Flow Typologies
  - RHS integrates flow types (e.g., free fall, cascade, riffle, pool, etc.) and channel features (riffles, pools, mid-channel bars) to classify habitat quality.
- Banktop Land Use and Vegetation
  - 10 m banktop transect captures land-use categories (e.g., broadleaf woodland, grassland, arable, wetland, open water) and vegetation structure (bare, uniform, simple, complex).
- SERCON and Notable Features
  - SERCON collects data on planform, channel profiles, recovery, and naturalness of riparian and bank vegetation; adds context for conservation-value scoring.
- Data Integration and Policy Linkages
  - Data support national and international policy alignment (Rio/Agenda 21, CBD, EU Habitats Directive, CAP reform, etc.) and inform conservation and management decisions.

## Permissions, Access, and Ethics
- Emphasis on obtaining landowner permission in advance; letters and direct contact prior to visits; on-site permission verified at time of survey.
- Procedures for access denial include abandoning the square or adapting the RHS sampling if only parts are accessible; surveyors carry identification and follow courteous engagement with landowners.

## Practical Implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Standardised, repeatable methodologies enable reliable trend analysis and cross-site comparisons over time.
- Rich, multi-component data (macro-invertebrates, RHS, diatoms, exuviae, chemistry) support integrated environmental health assessments and policy evaluation.
- The emphasis on data quality assurance, replicates, and accreditation aligns with requirements for robust, defensible environmental indicators.
- Data interoperability with GIS and remote sensing (satellite imagery, 1:10,000 and 1:50,000 maps) enhances linkage between ground-truth data and broader spatial analyses.
- The framework demonstrates a pathway for making underlying data accessible for reuse, not just final outputs, addressing the archetype’s value-adding and data-access challenges.

## Endnotes: Key Takeaways
- Countryside Survey 2000 Module 2 provides a comprehensive, standardized protocol for monitoring freshwater habitats across GB, emphasizing consistency, data integrity, and long-term trend analysis.
- The integrated approach (RHS, RIVPACS, diatoms, exuviae, chemistry) supports robust environmental health assessments and policy-relevant insights, with explicit procedures to ensure data quality and comparability over time.
