# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximises public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Current Countryside Survey partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Protects sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys’ scientific integrity, environmental protection, and continued landowner permission.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access and release framework
- Spatial data allows determination of whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references require exceptional access; CEH may preprocess to avoid releasing locations.
- Very exceptional circumstances may allow external release of location information under licence if the requester demonstrates that associated data/models carry equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality and store data securely; access limited to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation that location data was securely destroyed.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit grid reference releases have similar license terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality deemed necessary for six-digit releases.
- Licences for four-digit releases include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the defined principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organization.
- If access is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS partnership use, CEH aims to provide reasonable preprocessing support within moderate demand; external requests are considered case-by-case.
- Partner organisations and potential data users are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
