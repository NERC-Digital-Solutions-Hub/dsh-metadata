# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- All other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.

## Scope and data types
- Applies only to CS square location data and spatial data inside survey squares.
- Does not apply to other CS datasets, which remain publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (with CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
- Public interest supports confidentiality; requests managed by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOIA 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Approximate location: four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence for predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Precise location: six-digit grid references require pre-processing analysis by CEH to avoid release; extremely exceptional cases may allow external release under licence if IP/confidentiality criteria are at least equal to CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and thus are subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release and usage
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals for agreed purposes.
- Licences are finite in duration and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Licensees must not use data to locate or identify specific CS squares or landowners.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases, but still prohibit trying to derive precise locations.

## Licensing and governance
- Decisions on exceptional release are made by CEH on behalf of NERC.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by authorised representatives.
- If a release is denied, CEH/NERC follow FOI/EIR procedures to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal, pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before using data under this policy; CEH may assist as part of collaboration or as a paid service, negotiated case-by-case.
