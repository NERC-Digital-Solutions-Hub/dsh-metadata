Countryside Survey 2000. Module 2: survey of freshwater habitats. Field handbook v.2.0

## Overview and aims
- Standardised field handbook for surveying freshwater habitats as part of Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000).
- Aims to collect comparable, ground-truth data to support land-use and biodiversity assessments, inform policy, and enable timeseries analysis with CS1990.
- Integrates multiple data streams: aquatic macroinvertebrates (RIVPACS), River Habitat Survey (RHS), diatoms, and chironomid pupal exuviae, plus Ecofact-type macrophyte surveys.
- Planned outputs to support national/biodiversity policy contexts (e.g., sustainable development indicators, Habitat/Biodiversity directives).

## Sampling framework and site selection
- Survey scope: field sampling across 435 1-km squares (CS2000). Previous CS1990 total sampled: 508 squares.
- CS2000 design changes:
  - Re-survey all 508 CS1990 squares (England, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man) except two Isle of Man sites; replace where needed.
  - Add 30 new squares to improve single-country land-cover and biological estimates; include up to 30 reserve or replacement sites (MR) where needed.
  - Satellite-ground truth linkage: plan to construct a Britain-wide land-cover map by integrating field data with satellite imagery (top-down vs bottom-up approach).
- Timeseries and country estimates:
  - Maintain timeseries continuity by re-surveying core CS1990 squares in a consistent order.
  - Separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) using only squares within each country.
- Information availability and access:
  - Field teams provided with two enlarged 1:10,000 maps per square, including sampling site locations and landowner ownership/contact information.
  - Repeat CS1990 squares are red-marked with prior sampling site (M); new squares have preferred site M and reserve MR sites for contingencies.

## Field visits, logistics and permissions
- Site visits scheduled by IFE River Laboratory with coordination across six ITE/CEH bases.
-Landowner permissions required prior to sampling; communications include advance letters and face-to-face verification on-site.
-Operational principles:
  - Follow-up IFE survey within four weeks of ITE survey when feasible.
  - Documentation: weekly lists of completed squares, access-denied areas, and dates; plot sheets for new squares; landowner addresses; and access notes.
- Field team structure and duties:
  - Each site surveyed by two IFE surveyors; roles A and B defined for sampling order and data collection.
  - Emphasis on permission, good communication with landowners, and compliance with local instructions.

## Procedures and sequencing at each site
- Survey sequence:
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS) first; followed by RHS environmental assessment; then diatom and chironomid exuviae sampling; replicate samples included for quality control.
  - For each square, a 50 m RHS reach is centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling point (M or MR). The RHS 500 m section is surveyed irrespective of flow conditions.
  - Photographs: two key photographs per site—macroinvertebrate sampling point and 500 m RHS reach; chalkboards label site and sampling point identifiers.
- Permissions and contingencies:
  - If access to parts of a square is denied, sampling may be abandoned or adapted (e.g., RHS skipped; alternate survey planning with senior staff).
- Data capture and labeling:
  - All samples and environmental data are carefully labeled (square number, land-class/square-number, date, sample type, replicates).
  - Maps annotate upper/lower limits of RHS reach; diatom sampling site (D); chironomid exuviae site (C).
  - Replicate samples clearly labeled as first/replicate or first/second, etc.

## Sampling methods in detail

### Macroinvertebrates and environmental data (RIVPACS)
- Sampling approach:
  - Standardised macroinvertebrate sampling using a long-handled pond-net (1 mm mesh) with three minutes of active sampling plus a one-minute manual search.
  - Objective: obtain a broad range of taxa across habitats in proportion to their cover; aim for comparability rather than exhaustive taxon sampling.
  - At deep or complex sites, optional dredge/air-lift approaches may be used but select methods to maintain comparability.
- Replicates and quality control:
  - 10% of sites receive replicate macroinvertebrate sampling; at replicate sites, sampling is allocated between Surveyors A and B to test inter- and intra-operator variability.
  - Ten percent of all flowing-water sites undergo replicate sampling; replicate results audited to ensure consistency.
- Sample handling and preservation:
  - Macroinvertebrate samples fixed in 10% formalin (from field) and transported in labelled pots; fixative handling adheres to COSHH and safety guidance.
  - Samples stored in grey stacking trays; large samples may require additional containers.
- Environmental data collection:
  - Environmental data for the entire sampling area (width, depth, substratum, velocity, etc.) recorded on an RHS sample area form.
  - Field measurements target modal conditions; measurements for width, depth, substratum, and velocity follow specified protocols to ensure comparability with RIVPACS predictions.
  - Substratum is categorized by four Wentworth-size classes; percentage cover estimated for each class (total 100% for surface cover, bedrock omitted).

### River Habitat Survey (RHS)
- Coverage and objectives:
  - RHS module surveys a 500 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site, documenting physical structure, habitat features, banktop land-use, vegetation structure, and channel characteristics.
  - SERCON integration (see below) adds a streamlined conservation-value assessment to RHS.
- Spot-checks and sweep-ups:
  - Ten spot-checks (approximately every 50 m) record flow types, channel features, vegetation structure, and land-use along 1 m wide across the channel (E, F, G sections).
  - Sweep-up at the end of the 500 m reach records additional features and compiles a comprehensive site-level picture (Sections D, K, etc.).
- Channel features and land-use:
  - Detailed typology for bank materials, bank modifications, channel substrates, vegetation types, and bank-top land-use within defined transects.
  - Abbreviations and spot-check keys standardised to promote consistency across survey teams.
- Safety and accreditation:
  - RHS surveyors must be accredited; co-ordinators managed training and accreditation processes.

### Diatoms and Chironomid Pupae Exuviae
- Diatoms:
  - Collected where possible within 25 m upstream of macroinvertebrate sampling; alternative substrates (gravel) used if necessary.
  - Method details include handling for field filtration and sampling from gravel when necessary.
- Chironomid pupal exuviae:
  - Five-second sweeps to collect floating exuviae from along backswaters, eddies, and macrophyte growths within 25 m of the macroinvertebrate site.
  - Samples fixed with formalin and stored with robust labeling; replicate sampling as per quality-control procedures.
- Quality control:
  - Exuviae collection uses CPET-based guidance for evaluation of water quality via exuvial assemblages.

## Data management, quality assurance and training
- Data integrity and comparability:
  - Emphasis on standardised field procedures, careful labeling, and consistent data collection to ensure comparability across time and space.
  - Training and accreditation are central to ensuring RHS and SERCON components meet national guidelines.
- Replicates and audits:
  - 10% replicate macroinvertebrate, environmental data, diatom, and exuviae samples undergo quality control testing.
  - Approximately 7% of RHS surveys audited by experienced IFE staff.
- Data products and accessibility:
  - Field data support creation of long-term biodiversity habitat datasets; integration with satellite-derived land-cover information to link ground-truth data with remote sensing.
  - Datasets prepared with metadata and shareable under NERC/NORA framework.

## Equipment, safety, transport, and labelling
- Equipment:
  - Standard long-handled pond-nets (1 mm mesh), 1.3 L sample pots, 40% formalin stocks, storage trays, labeling materials, camera, GPS, maps, and safety gear (life jackets, gloves, barrier cream, etc.).
- Transport and storage:
  - Samples transported in lidded crates; fixatives carried in separate sealed containers; formalin handled with appropriate safety measures.
- Safety and lone-working:
  - Fieldwork safety follows Environment Agency and NERC guidance; lone-worker code of practice; PPE and safety equipment specified for field conditions; water safety and first-aid readiness emphasized.

## SERCON and integration with RHS
- SERCON (System for Evaluating Rivers for Conservation):
  - Adds a compact, field-based assessment of conservation value to the RHS data, covering planform, longitudinal/cross-sectional recovery, bank naturalness, riparian vegetation, and bank/shoreline naturalness.
  - Includes a 0–95% scale to indicate extent of impact or recovery, with sections I–IX capturing planform changes, recovery, and naturalness metrics.
  -SERVes CS2000’s need to quantify conservation value alongside structural habitat data from RHS.
- How RHS and SERCON interoperate:
  - RHS provides physical habitat structure data; SERCON supplements with evaluation of conservation value and naturalness, aiding land-management recommendations and monitoring.

## Endnotes: planning horizon and use
- The CS2000 freshwater module is designed to produce a robust, policy-relevant, time-series dataset by standardising field protocols, linking to remote sensing, and enabling cross-year and cross-country comparisons.
- Outputs intended to inform government and non-government agencies, and to support biodiversity indicators, habitat policy, and sustainable countryside planning.
