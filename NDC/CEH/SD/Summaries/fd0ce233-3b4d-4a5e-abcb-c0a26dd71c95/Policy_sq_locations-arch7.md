# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, environmental integrity, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Requests for information handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to show which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations): released only in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) can identify square and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit locations.
- Exceptional access requires demonstration that partner IP/data to be used cannot be released and carries equal/higher confidentiality.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational uses.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to meet evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP-confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases.
- A clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from the data or claim to have done so.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and the CS partners, decides on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory Act/Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal CS-partner pre-processing needs within reasonable demand; other organisations are case-by-case.

## Practical process and guidance for users
- It is recommended to consult with CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy.
- CEH may assist as a scientific lead or determine collaboration/payment arrangements; support may vary by case.
- Requests from external organisations are assessed individually; internal CS partners may receive more timely pre-processing support.

## Summary for GIS-focused use
- Location data are tightly controlled to protect sampling integrity and landowner relations.
- Access is possible under strict licensing, with clear distinctions between four-digit (limited) and six-digit (exceptional) releases.
- Data handling, project scope, and governance are tightly defined, with annual reporting and joint responsibility between CEH and NERC.
