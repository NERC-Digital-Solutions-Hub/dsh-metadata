# MODULE 2: SURVEY OF FRESHWATER HABITATS

- Purpose and scope
  - National scale field handbook (CS2000) to standardise collection of map-based freshwater habitat data for GIS-based analysis and policy support.
  - Focuses on data products from field surveys (habitat features, vegetation, land use, and biotic/chemical indicators) to enable spatial understanding and monitoring of freshwater ecosystems.

- Data collected and data types
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - Core 500 m reach around macroinvertebrate sampling point (M or reserve MR).
    - Components include spot-checks along the 500 m reach, a 50 m RHS sub-reach around the sampling site, and a sweep-up of the full length.
    - Data capture includes channel form, flow types, banktop land use, bank vegetation structure, channel vegetation types, substrate categories, and related features.
    - Spatial scope uses 1:10,000 site maps with 1:50,000 OS coverage; coordinates and land ownership data linked to each square.
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS) and environmental data
    - Standardised sampling of aquatic macroinvertebrates with environmental data (width, depth, substrate, velocity) collected for comparability across sites.
  - Diatom sampling
  - Chironomid pupal exuviae sampling (CPET/RIVPACS-compatible approach)
  - Riverbank and habitat context
    - Ecofact macrophyte transects across river corridor in each square (up to five 10 m x 2 m transects).
  - Water chemistry (River RHS protocol)
    - pH, conductivity, alkalinity, soluble phosphate, trace metals, major cations; on-site filtration and preservation protocols.
  - Alder health and disease observations
  - SERCON component (optional but integrated)
    - Assessment of conservation value with respect to planform, channel profile, recovery, naturalness of riparian vegetation, and bank vegetation.

- Sampling framework and geographic scope
  - GB-wide programme with 1 x 1 km sample units (squares) drawn from the ITE Land Classification System lineage.
  - CS1990 established 508 squares; CS2000 expands sampling to include 30 additional squares for country-specific estimates and to refresh data with new land cover/biological information.
  - In CS2000, field teams sample 435 1 km squares for freshwater modules, with ongoing aim to maintain a timeseries by re-surveying many of the 1990 squares and adding new or replacement sites.
  - Data outputs designed for GIS use, enabling country-level (England, Scotland, Wales) reporting and integration with satellite-derived land cover maps and remote sensing data.

- Field procedures and data collection workflow
  - Site planning and access
    - Pre-visit landowner permissions; advance briefing with landowners; field teams coordinate with project leaders to confirm access.
    - On-site permissions and safety checks prior to sampling; if access is denied, follow replacement square procedures.
  - Surveying and sampling approach
    - 1 km square sampling: repeat of 1990 sites where possible; up to 30 new or replacement squares for better country estimates.
    - RHS sampling: 500 m reach centred on macroinvertebrate sampling site; measurement points and sampling points defined on 1:10,000 and 1:50,000 maps.
    - Sampling requires two field staff per site (A and B roles described for tasks and data capture).
    - Replicate sampling (10% of sites) for quality control; half replicated by same surveyor and half by the other to test inter- and intra-operator variability.
  - Equipment, labeling, and handling
    - Detailed field equipment lists (nets, pots, fixatives, labels, cameras, GPS, maps, safety gear) and stringent labeling rules (external waterproof labels; replicate labeling for replicates).
    - Formaldehyde-based fixatives used for macroinvertebrate samples; field storage in labelled pots with appropriate safety handling.
  - Data collection forms and data management
    - RHS forms (Part Three) with multiple sections (A–S) for background, spot-checks, channel features, banktop land-use, vegetation structure, banktop and bankface characteristics, and SERCON components.
    - On-site transcription of data to forms, including exact sample area definitions, width/depth/velocity measurements, substrate proportions, and vegetation percentages (with guidance on estimating and standardising visuals).
    - Photographs required of macroinvertebrate sampling point and RHS reach with site boards for re-location and context.
  - Mapping and geolocation
    - All sampling locations tied to 1:10,000 maps with M/MR codes; repeat sites labeled with red marks; new sites labeled MRn as reserve sampling points when the preferred M site is dry.
    - Grid references (NGR), square numbers, and land class codes recorded for GIS linkage.
  - Safety and risk management
    - Comprehensive field safety guidance (PPE, life jackets, wading precautions, lone-worker considerations) and COSHH-compliant handling of chemicals (fixatives).

- GIS-relevant data management and quality assurance
  - Standardisation and comparability
    - Emphasis on consistent field procedures across observers, with formal training, accreditation (RHS accreditation process), and regular inter-operator checks.
    - Replication and auditing planned to quantify error and ensure compatibility with RIVPACS and SERCON analyses.
  - Metadata and data lineage
    - Metadata elements include square identity, country/unit alignment, sampling date/time, surveyor IDs, sampling methods, and site context (flow type, land use, vegetation structure).
    - Data layers expected: RHS habitat types and flow classifications; substrate distributions; banktop/bankface vegetation; channel features (riffles, pools, bars); land-use buffers; alder health/disease, and SERCON scores.
  - Temporal aspect and timeseries
    - Re-survey strategy to maintain long-term datasets; CS2000 is designed to produce a repeatable timeseries by aligning with 1990 data and augmenting with additional sites for country-specific trend analysis.
  - Integration with remote sensing and policy frameworks
    - Linkage to satellite-derived land-cover data, enabling two-tier ground-truthing (top-down remote sensing with bottom-up field data).
    - Outputs are designed to support government and NGO decisions related to biodiversity, habitat restoration, water quality, and rural land management.

- Safety, training, and governance
  - Fieldwork safety is integral: PPE, life jackets, lone-worker policies, emergency procedures, tetanus vaccination, and formal safety checklists.
  - Training and accreditation
    - RHS training and accreditation required; ongoing refresher opportunities and coordinator-led training.
  - Appendices and governance
    - Appendices provide SERCON methodology, health & safety guidance, and additional procedural detail for field forms and data handling.

- End notes
  - The document emphasizes rigorous standardisation, accurate geolocation, and robust data handling to enable GIS-driven analysis of freshwater habitats across Great Britain, with a structured framework for linking habitat data, biotic sampling, water chemistry, and conservation assessments (SERCON) into coherent, policy-relevant GIS data products.
