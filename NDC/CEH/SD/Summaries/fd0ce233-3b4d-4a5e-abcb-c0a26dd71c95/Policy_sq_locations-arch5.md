# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public benefit and utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Why locations are confidential:
  - To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - To protect the integrity of the sampling strategy, environment, and future landowner permission to survey.
  - Ensures continued capability to inform environmental policy.

- Release and access framework:
  - Location information can be released at varying precision:
    - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) under licence to identify general location within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
    - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) only in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may process analyses to avoid releasing locations; external release requires legal demonstration that IP data used alongside CS data has equal/higher confidentiality.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) considered capable of identifying square locations and subject to the same exceptional access terms as six-digit references.

- Licensing and use conditions:
  - Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate project need.
  - Licences are granted for finite periods and specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
  - End of period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
  - No transfer of data to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria.
  - A clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from the data or to claim such deduction.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; approvals signed by a senior authorised representative.
  - CEH reports annually to CS partners on access applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH should provide pre-processing analysis support within reasonable timeframes to CS partners; external requests are case-by-case and may involve collaboration or payment.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to work involving data covered by this policy; CEH involvement is helpful but not always required.

- Practical guidance for data users:
  - If needed, engage CEH early to determine feasibility and licensing steps.
  - Understand that precise location data are highly restricted and require exceptional justification and formal licensing.
  - Ensure compliance with confidentiality, storage, retention, and destruction requirements throughout the data lifecycle.
