# MODULE 2: SURVEY OF FRESHWATER HABITATS Field handbook v.2.0

- Overview
  - Purpose: Field handbook for Countryside Survey 2000 Module 2 (survey of freshwater habitats); establishes standardised data collection procedures to support data system coherence, comparability over time, and integration with national programs (RHS, SERCON, RIVPACS).
  - Scope: Four main sampling components plus ecofact macrophyte survey:
    - Aquatic macro-invertebrate sampling (RIVPACS-compatible data)
    - River Habitat Survey (RHS) including alder disease and chemical sampling
    - Diatom survey
    - Chironomid pupal exuviae survey
    - Optional SERCON components for conservation assessment

- Data assets and metadata
  - Site and sampling framework
    - 1 km squares selected; explicit mapping, land-class context, country partitions, and unique square codes (e.g., M site, MR replication sites).
    - Repeat sampling of CS1990 squares; 30 additional squares for country-specific estimates; total of 435 squares targeted.
  - Field data and forms
    - Macro-invertebrate sampling and environmental data forms; RHS forms (spot-checks, sweep-up, and SERCON components); sample IDs, replicate indicators, and NGR/grid references.
    - Photographs with site and sampling-point boards for re-location and context.
  - Data standards and interoperability
    - Emphasis on RIVPACS compatibility for macro-invertebrate data and alignment with SERCON typologies.
    - Standardised labelling, sample containers, fixation (10% formalin), and transport/storage protocols.
  - Data provenance and governance
    - Documentation of permissions, landowner communications, and access decisions; procedures for partial access and replacement sampling when necessary.
    - Training, accreditation, and quality control embedded to ensure data integrity across teams.

- Data collection procedures and standards
  - Planning and sampling design
    - Re-survey of 508 CS1990 squares; addition of 30 new squares to bolster country estimates; 435 squares sampled in CS2000.
    - Pre-survey planning includes landowner notification, access logistics, and co-ordination between ITE and IFE teams; clear responsibilities for field coordinators.
  - Modules and procedures
    - Macro-invertebrate sampling (RIVPACS): standardized three-minute pond-net sampling plus one-minute manual search; replicate sampling at 10% of sites; detailed environmental data collection; strict labeling and storage.
    - River Habitat Survey (RHS): 500 m reach centered on the sampling point; 10 spot-checks at ~50 m intervals; recording of banktop land-use, vegetation structure, channel vegetation types, and 500 m and 50 m RHS data; integration with SERCON where required.
    - Diatoms and chironomid pupal exuviae: sampled within proximity to macro-invertebrate site; standard field protocols and packaging.
    - Water chemistry: single chemical sample per RHS; on-site filtration; staged labeling and on-site processing.
  - Permissions and safety
    - Mandatory landowner permissions; formal introduction letters; on-site verification of access; procedures if access is refused; emphasis on safety and use of PPE; lone worker guidelines and emergency contact protocols.
  - Equipment and labelling
    - Comprehensive equipment lists (nets, pots, fixatives, bottles, storage trays, labeling materials); robust labeling (outside labels with pencil), preservation and transport instructions; avoidance of cross-contamination and proper cleaning between sites.

- Data quality, validation, and QC
  - Standardisation and training
    - Accredited RHS surveyors; formal training and certification; cross-team calibration to minimise observer variability.
    - Regularly swapped team members to reduce technique drift; dedicated QA procedures.
  - Replication and auditing
    - 10% replicate sampling for macro-invertebrates, environmental data, diatoms, and exuviae; inter- and intra-operator variability assessments; approximately 7% RHS audit program.
  - Data completeness and consistency
    - Stringent field form completion, legibility, and site reference numbering; use of standardized measurement protocols (width, depth, substratum, velocity, etc.) to support comparability with RIVPACS and downstream analyses.
  - Safety and hazardous materials
    - COSHH-compliant handling of fixatives (formalin); explicit safety training and procedures; emergency and first-aid precautions documented.

- Data governance, permissions, and access
  - Permissions and access management
    - Proactive landowner engagement; formal permissions managed by field teams; procedures for denied access (abandonment or partial RHS adaptation); replacement sampling planned when necessary.
  - Data stewardship
    - Clear lineage from field collection to laboratory processing; fixed procedures for storage, transport, and sample custody; documentation of field conditions, permissions, and access events.
  - Compliance and safety
    - Safety-first approach with PPE, life jackets, lone-worker protocols, and leptospirosis precautions; instructions for accidents and medical readiness.

- Data processing, storage, and dissemination
  - Processing workflows
    - Field-to-lab data handoffs via standardized forms; physical storage in River Laboratory facilities; consistent labeling and packaging to preserve sample integrity.
  - Outputs and policy relevance
    - Data designed for compatibility with RIVPACS and SERCON analyses; outputs feed national assessments of habitat quality, biodiversity, and conservation value; information intended to inform policy and management initiatives.

- Challenges and opportunities for Data Leaders
  - Core challenges
    - Achieving and maintaining data standardisation across sites, teams, and years; capturing complete metadata for timeseries analyses; accessing scattered data sources and ensuring data discoverability.
  - Opportunities for data strategy
    - The handbook exemplifies a rigorous, auditable data pipeline from field collection to analytic outputs; highlights the value of metadata governance, accreditation, and cross-agency coordination.
    - Potential enhancements for modern data leadership include digitising data capture, implementing a centralized data dictionary and catalog, automating quality checks, and ensuring seamless integration with broader data platforms (e.g., linking RHS, SERCON, and RIVPACS datasets for policy analytics).
  - Data leadership takeaways
    - Emphasise standardized protocols, provenance, and reproducibility; embed training and certification; enforce robust QA and replication; design data systems for interoperability across national programs and time horizons; align field data practices with policy-relevant reporting standards.
