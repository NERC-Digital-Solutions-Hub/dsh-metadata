# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aim: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- CS partners (current): Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports continued ability to inform environmental policy.

## When and how locations may be released
- Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise): released only if CEH can preprocess analysis to avoid direct release; otherwise VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances required for external release under licence.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, linear features): released only under the same exceptional circumstances as six-digit references.
- In exceptional cases, external release requires legal justification that external IP is equally or more confidential than CS data.

## Licence terms and restrictions
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be reused for other organisational duties.
- End of licence period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No release to third parties that could compromise square locations; cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases: similar terms to six-digit but do not require the highest IP-confidentiality criteria; users may not attempt to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
- Licence approvals/denials follow statutory Act and Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- Practical support: CEH aims to provide preprocessing support within reasonable timeframes for CS partnership; other organisations’ requests handled case-by-case.
- Recommendation: potential users consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
