# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data for public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity; policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data is publicly accessible.
- CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Why locations are confidential:
  - Preserve sampling representativeness and goodwill of landowners.
  - Critical for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
  - Public interest justification for confidentiality; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- Circumstances and precision for location release:
  - Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to indicate which 10x10 km grid square contains CS squares.
  - Six-digit grid references: only under VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; applicants must show that their IP/data require confidentiality at a level equal to or higher than CS data; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release.
  - Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, linear features): could identify square; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

- Specific conditions of release:
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorized individuals.
  - Licences are time-limited for specific projects; data must be destroyed at licence end; no retention for other purposes.
  - No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise square locations; not for planning visits or checking landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licencees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases; a clause prohibits attempts to deduce precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; licences must be signed by an authorised representative of the licensee.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - CEH may provide pre-processing support to CS partners within reasonable demand; requests from other organisations handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use any data covered by the policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
