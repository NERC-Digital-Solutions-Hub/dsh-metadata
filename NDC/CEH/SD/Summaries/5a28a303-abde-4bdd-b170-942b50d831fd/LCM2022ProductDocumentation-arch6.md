# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2022

- Aims and scope
  - The UKCEH Land Cover Map 2022 (LCM2022) is produced to map land cover across the UK annually using automated methods.
  - Product suite includes seven datasets: three for Great Britain and Northern Ireland each (GB and NI combined) comprising a 10 m classified-pixel dataset, a land parcel dataset, and a 25 m rasterised land parcels dataset; plus a 1 km summary raster product covering GB and NI.
  - Key goal is to enable informed decisions and change detection by providing self-describing, auditable data products with validation and accuracy information.

- Core concepts and terminology (for data users)
  - Bootstrap Training: automatic training data selection from historical land maps to train a Random Forest classifier.
  - Classification Scene: multi-layer input (Seasonal Composite Image bands plus Context Rasters) used for classification.
  - Seasonal Composite Image: four-season Sentinel-2 based spectral inputs to differentiate land cover.
  - Context Rasters: 10 m auxiliary layers (terrain, proximity to built features, water, coast, etc.) to reduce spectral confusion.
  - UKCEH Land Cover Classes: 21 classes aligned with Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats (with careful handling to preserve comparability).
  - UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework: fixed 0.5 ha minimum-area land parcels used to structure outputs and support change detection.

- Data production and workflow
  - Inputs and outputs
    - Seasonal Sentinel-2 data are resampled to 10 m to form Classification Scenes (with some bands at 60 or 20 m in early bands).
    - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets: per-pixel classification with two bands (class ID, and associated probability/confidence). These pixels preserve fine landscape detail (not generalised by the Land Parcel Framework).
    - Land Parcel datasets: derived by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to create parcel-based attributes and a structured, noise-reduced output.
    - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets: raster at 25 m with three bands (dominant land cover, conf, purity) summarising parcel-level outputs.
    - Land Parcel Vector products: vector representations of land parcels for GB and NI (linked via DOIs in the dataset metadata).
    - 1 km summary rasters: aggregate outputs summarising 25 m rasters to 1 km scale (dominant class, dominant aggregate, and percentage cover per class/aggregate).
  - Classification and validation
    - Use of Bootstrap Training with a Random Forest classifier to assign class membership per pixel.
    - Training data drawn from LCM2019–LCM2021 with selection criteria (>80% probability and consistent class across three years) to robustly train the model.
    - Validation performed with 33,107 reference points across 21 classes; overall thematic accuracy of 86.1%.
  - Coordinate systems and extents
    - Great Britain: British National Grid (EPSG 27700).
    - Northern Ireland: Irish TM75 grid (EPSG 29903).
    - Outputs include pixel-level data in 10 m and parcel-based outputs in 25 m; parcel counts and extents are large (GB ~6.7 million parcels; NI ~0.9 million parcels for the parcel datasets).
  - Versioning and references
    - DOIs provided for each dataset; detailed citations available (e.g., Marston et al. 2024 for 10 m classified pixels, 25 m rasterised parcels, land parcel products, and 1 km summary rasters).

- Product details and data structure
  - 10 m Classified Pixels (GB and NI)
    - Output: two-band raster per region; Band 1 = UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier; Band 2 = class membership probability/confidence.
    - Not generalised by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework, preserving detailed features below the 0.5 ha minimum mapping unit.
  - Land Parcel Datasets (GB and NI)
    - Generated by intersecting the 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels (GB and NI)
    - Three-band raster: band 1 = dominant land cover (mode), band 2 = conf, band 3 = purity.
  - Land Parcel Products (Vector) (GB and NI)
    - Vector representation of land parcels with parcel-specific attributes prepared for GIS use.
  - 1 km Summary Rasters (GB and NI)
    - Dominant class (1 band) and percentage cover (21 bands for classes, 10 bands for aggregates) per 1 km pixel.
    - Percentage values are rounded integers; coastal areas may sum to less than 100 due to coast-edge resolution.
  - Context and classification details
    - Context rasters (GB and NI) supplied to improve discrimination among spectrally similar classes.
    - Classification Scenes: GB classified in 32 tiles; NI uses a single Scene due to smaller area; scenes are trained and classified independently.

- Validation, accuracy, and known issues
  - Overall accuracy: 86.1% at full 21-class thematic detail.
  - Validation dataset comprised GB countryside surveys, National Forest Inventory data, Rural Payments data, and bespoke validation points.
  - Known issues
    - Some polygons missing from vector land parcel products, causing nodata regions in corresponding 25 m rasters; effects considered negligible for 1 km products.
    - 10 m classified pixels datasets are unaffected by these missing polygons.
  - Consistency and caveats
    - Outputs reflect both real annual land-cover change and method-driven variation; slight differences across years should be interpreted with methodological context.

- Usage notes and interpretation aids
  - Appendix 1 and 2 provide detailed notes on UKCEH Land Cover Classes and their relationship to BAP Broad Habitats; important for users needing crosswalks to BAP terminology and for understanding class-level confusion.
  - Appendix 3 enumerates the full list of LCM2022 datasets and their DOIs.
  - Appendix 4 contains confusion matrices (reference vs predicted) for assessing class-specific accuracy and producer/user accuracy metrics.
  - Appendix 5 and 6 present recommended color schemes for display (standard and color-blind friendly) with accompanying QGIS symbology files for quick map production.
  - Citing and provenance
    - Each LCM2022 dataset has a DOI; recommended to cite Marston et al. (2024) for production methods and the dataset-specific DOIs for data use.

- Practical guidance for data support and reuse
  - For longitudinal analyses, use the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to align parcel-based outputs across years, noting that parcel identifiers (gid) have changed relative to LCM2015.
  - When integrating with other datasets, reference both the 10 m classified pixel data (with class and confidence) and the 25 m parcel-based outputs (mode, conf, purity) to capture both pixel-level detail and parcel-level context.
  - Use the 1 km summary rasters for broad-area analyses and change detection at coarser resolution, keeping in mind the rounding of percentage covers and coastal edge effects.
  - Access and citation
    - Data products are available with DOIs; ensure proper citation per dataset and consult Marston et al. (2024a–g) for methodological context and prior versions.

- End notes
  - The guide emphasizes ongoing methodological evolution; users should expect annual updates with potential method-driven changes alongside real land-cover dynamics.
