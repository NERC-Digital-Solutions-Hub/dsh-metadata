# Supporting information for: Movement of songbirds between supplementary feeders in urban neighbourhoods in Southern England, UK

- Purpose and content
  - Datasets record the time, date, and location of visits by songbirds fitted with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags to bird feeders equipped with RFID readers.
  - Seven species tagged: Blue tits (BLUTI), Great tits (GRETI), Long-tailed tits (LOTTI), House Sparrows (HOUSP), Green finch (GREFI), Chaffinch (CHAFF), and Nuthatches (NUTHA); Blue tits and Great tits were the most abundant.
  - Aim is to support analysis of movement and feeder use in urban environments.

- Study design and timeline
  - Conducted in three towns in Southern England.
  - Data collection spanned 14 months: 1 July 2013 to 31 August 2014.
  - First two months served as setup; main data collection occurred in the final 12 months.
  - 51 feeding stations across networks; each network comprised 17 RFID-equipped feeders.
  - Feeders installed in private gardens with average inter-station distance ~81 m (±20 m SD); feeders placed ~0.5 m from cover; stations maintained by residents with researchers visiting roughly every 30 days.

- Data files and contents
  - NERC_Data_Centre_RFID_raw_data.txt: per-visit records including bird tag number, feeder site and garden, and timestamp.
  - NERC_Data_Centre_ringing_data.txt: ringing information per tag, including capture subsite, capture date, age class, and sex/gender.
  - NERC_Data_Centre_Coordinates.txt: coordinates showing relative positions of each feeder and ringing site.
  - Data and supporting information available through the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre.

- Data collection and instrumentation
  - RFID readers and antennas custom-built on Arduino platforms; antennas fixed to the underside of a single perch on each feeder.
  - 125 kHz RFID system; visits recorded with a 400 ms on/400 ms off cycle.
  - Recording such that time/date and tag ID are stored on a 4 GB memory card; powered continuously by a 12 V battery.
  - 24-hour operation across all feeders.

- Bird capture and tagging
  - Birds captured using mist nets and tape lures at two locations per network to maximize catch rates.
  - Birds ringed with British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) metal rings and fitted with PIT tags (integrated into an 8 mm plastic ring).
  - Post-capture handling and tagging conducted by field researchers; Dr Daniel T C Cox led data collection.

- Data use and publication
  - Data analysis and conclusions published in Cox et al. (2016).
