  - Locate and verify available data; address metadata shortcomings by contacting data originators.
  - Add metadata to datasets and publicly share the data used, acknowledging this can be a barrier.

  - Ensure data quality through cleaning, transformation, analysis; present findings clearly via reports, charts, or dashboards.
  - Disseminate outputs; consult stakeholders; ensure underlying data is shared appropriately; implement data governance processes.

- Key practices and outputs
  - Data governance and open data practices.
  - Clear communication of complex findings through accessible formats (reports, charts, dashboards).
  - Stakeholder consultation and transparency about data sources.

- Particular Challenges
  - Lack of data or data of insufficient quality.
  - Limited access to data, including delays and timeliness.
  - Siloes within and between organisations hindering data sharing.
  - Requirements to publicly share datasets acting as a barrier.
  - Difficulty keeping data up to date; concerns about data being current.
  - Inadequate metadata hindering assessment of suitability.
  - Data formats requiring substantial transformation to be usable.
  - Challenges in communicating complex findings clearly.
  - Establishing and maintaining data governance to ensure standards, storage, sharing, and ongoing updating.
