# Supporting information for: Movement of songbirds between supplementary feeders in urban neighbourhoods in Southern England, UK

- Overview
  - Dataset records time, date, and location of visits by songbirds fitted with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags at RFID-equipped feeders.
  - Species involved: Blue tits, Great tits (most abundant), Long-tailed tits, House Sparrows, Green finch, Chaffinch, Nuthatches.
  - Study conducted in three towns in Southern England over 14 months (1 July 2013 – 31 August 2014); initial setup period of two months, followed by 12 months of main data collection.
  - Data contributed to understanding movement of feeder-using songbirds in urban environments; related analysis published in Cox et al. (2016).

- Data components (files included)
  - NERC_Data_Centre_RFID_raw_data.txt: tag number, feeder site/garden, and timestamp of each visit.
  - NERC_Data_Centre_ringing_data.txt: ringing information per tag number (capture subsite, capture date, age, sex/gender).
  - NERC_Data_Centre_Coordinates.txt: coordinates of each feeder and ringing site; described in supporting documentation.

- Methodology
  - Equipment and setup: RFID readers with antennas mounted under a perch on standard seed feeders; 125 kHz antennas; recordings every 400 ms on and 400 ms off.
  - Data capture: time/date and tag ID logged to 4 GB memory cards; power supplied by 12V batteries for 24/7 operation.
  - Study design: 17 RFID feeding stations per network; three networks totaling 51 stations; stations located in private gardens (average 81 m apart; ~0.5 m from cover; feeder bottom ~1 m above ground).
  - Deployment: feeders installed up to six weeks before data collection to acclimate birds; same seed mix used across feeders; monthly visits (~every 30 days) to replace batteries and download data.
  - Bird capture and tagging: two common garden species captured using mist nets and lures, fitted with BTO rings and PIT tags (8 mm ring with molded PIT tag); data collection led by Dr. Daniel T. C. Cox; related analyses published in Cox et al. (2016).

- Access and reuse
  - Data credited to Cox, D.T.C. and Gaston, K.J. (2018) with DOI provided; full details available via the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
  - Citations and data access: dataset can be cited using the provided DOI; full details at the listed URLs.

- Data governance, quality, and reuse considerations (as relevant to monitoring frameworks)
  - Data provenance and lineage are clearly documented (raw RFID data, ringing data, and spatial coordinates), enabling traceability from raw observations to derived analyses.
  - Use of standardized identifiers (PIT tags, BTO rings) facilitates data integration and cross-referencing with other datasets.
  - Data are openly shareable through the EIDC with formal citation, supporting transparency and reproducibility for policy-relevant monitoring.
  - The dataset highlights considerations important to monitoring frameworks: field-based data collection across multiple private properties, standardized instrumentation, regular data downloads, and the need to document spatial relationships (coordinates) for movement analyses.
  - Related publications (Cox et al. 2016) provide analytical context, illustrating how such monitoring data inform understanding of urban form effects on wildlife movement.
  - Metadata completeness and documentation are supported by accompanying supporting documentation; some challenges acknowledged in broader monitoring practice (e.g., ensuring metadata richness, data interoperability across datasets) are exemplified by the need to rely on the provided coordinates and documentation to interpret the data accurately.
