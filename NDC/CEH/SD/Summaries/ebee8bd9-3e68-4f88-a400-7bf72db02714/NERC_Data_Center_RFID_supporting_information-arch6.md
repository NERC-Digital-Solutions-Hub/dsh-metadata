# Movement of songbirds between supplementary feeders in urban neighbourhoods in Southern England, UK

## Overview
- Dataset of visits by songbirds fitted with PIT tags to RFID-enabled feeders.
- Seven species targeted; blue tits and great tits most abundant.
- Collected in three towns in Southern England over 14 months (1 July 2013 – 31 August 2014).
- Initial setup period of two months; main data collection spanned the following 12 months.
- Data are structured to support movement and interaction analyses with end-user self-service potential (dashboards/reports).

## Data files and contents
- NERC_Data_Centre_RFID_raw_data.txt: tag number, feeder site, garden, and timestamp of each visit.
- NERC_Data_Centre_ringing_data.txt: ringing information per tag (ringing subsite, capture date, age, sex/gender).
- NERC_Data_Centre_Coordinates.txt: coordinates for feeder and ringing-site locations.
- Supporting documentation includes additional details on coordinates and methodology.
- Data can be cited via Cox, D.T.C.; Gaston, K.J. (2018) with full details at the provided DOIs.

## Methodology and instrumentation
- RFID readers integrated into bird feeders using Arduino components; 125 kHz system.
- Antennas positioned under a perch; 400 ms on, 400 ms off data logging cycle.
- Data logged with time, date, and tag ID to a 4 GB memory card; powered continuously by 12 V battery.
- Each network comprised 17 feeding stations; 51 stations in total across networks.
- Feeders placed in private gardens (~0.5 m from cover); stations typically ~81 m apart.
- Setup included a 6-week pre-experiment acclimation period; gardens maintained by residents; researchers conducted monthly data downloads and battery replacements.

## Study design and data collection
- Birds captured and tagged at two locations per network to maximise catch rates; mist nets and tape lures used.
- Species sampled: blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tit (Parus major).
- Birds were fitted with BTO metal rings and PIT tags; tagging occurred during the setup period.
- Data collection responsibility: Dr Daniel T C Cox; subsequent analyses published in Cox et al. (2016).
