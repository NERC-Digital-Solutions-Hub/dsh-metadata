# Materials and methods for: Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, 2018

-Overview
  - Aim: collect vertebrate radionuclide data within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone to assess exposure and contamination.
  - Approach: combine soil radionuclide measurements with small mammal capture and whole-body radiocesium and radiostrontium assessments.
  - Context: builds on a test application of the ERICA Tool for estimating exposure in small mammals.

-Study design and sites
  - Three forest sites chosen to represent differing soil radionuclide activity: Low, Medium, and High.
  - Each site established a 100 m x 100 m study area with trapping locations defined at 10 m intervals.
  - Site characteristics (vegetation and soils) varied by site:
    - Low: Scots pine-dominated, sparse understorey; soils include soddy pseudopodzolic with some podzolic-sandy and loamy sand gleys.
    - Medium: mix of pine and oak with sparse understorey; soils include soddy pseudopodzolic sandy and boggy soils on alluvial deposits.
    - High: birch-dominated conifer plantation history; ground cover mainly grasses with ericaceous species; soils include bog peat and soddy pseudopodzolic sandy.
  - Gamma-kerma rates measured at 5 cm above ground at each trapping point.

-Field sampling and trapping
  - Soil sampling: 23 soil samples per site, to 10 cm depth; samples extended 50 m beyond trapping area to encompass likely home ranges; GPS recorded.
  - Soil processing: dry, homogenise; analyze with germanium detectors for gamma-emitting radionuclides.
  - Trapping: 14 trapping sessions from early July to mid-August 2005.
  - Traps: 100 Sherman humane traps per site, baited with rolled oats, checked daily.
  - Target species: Apodemus flavicollis (yellow-necked mouse), Myodes glareolus (bank vole), Microtus spp. (vole spp.); only these were processed.

-Radionuclide measurements in soils and animals
  - Soil gamma-emitting radionuclides: analysed via high-purity germanium detectors; spectra processed with Genie-2000; counts adjusted to achieve <20% error on 40K.
  - Plutonium isotopes (238, 239, 240 Pu): determined in 10 g dry-weight soil sub-samples using Lx radiation method (13–23 keV) from excited uranium daughters; self-absorption correction via Ba (32–37 keV) Kx radiation; method validated against radiochemical analyses; detection limit 3–5 Bq; accuracy 10–15%.
  - Strontium-90: determined in 10 g dry-weight soil sub-samples from measurement of 90Y using a thin-film NaI detector; calibration for soils provided in Bondarkov et al. references.
  - Animal measurements: immediately after capture, each animal fitted with a LiF-100 thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) collar; record live weight and whole-body Cs-137 and Sr-90 using the described radiometric method.
  - Whole-body counting: animals counted in a lead-shielded container using a hyperpure germanium detector (for Cs-137) and a thin-film NaI detector (for Sr-90); Cs-137 spectra analyzed with Genie-2000; Sr-90 determined via its 90Y daughter.
  - Counting times: range from 150 to 1200 seconds depending on radioactivity.

-Animal handling, timing, and data management
  - Post-capture handling: animals returned to their original trapping point; recapture events noted.
  - TLD collar procedure: if recaptured >14 days after collaring, remove TLD, reweigh, re-measure Cs-137 and Sr-90; if recaptured <14 days, record location and release; additional Cs measurements when available.
  - Duration of TLD exposure: collars on animals for 6–36 days; 85 of 230 TLD collars recovered.
  - Control and supplementary TLDs: seven TLD collars from the UK used as controls; four randomly selected points had TLDs placed at 5 cm above ground, ground level, and 10 cm depth (with a paired Perspex-encapsulated unit in some cases); 25 of 36 possible paired TLDs recovered.
  - Data handling: recovered TLDs sent back to supplier for analysis alongside control TLDs.
