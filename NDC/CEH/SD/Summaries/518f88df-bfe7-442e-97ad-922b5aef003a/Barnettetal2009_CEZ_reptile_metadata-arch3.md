# Metadata (an explanation of column headings and units) for: Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, 2018, Gaschak, S.P., Beresford, N.A., Barnett, C.L., Wells, C., Maksimenko, A. and Chaplow, J.S. NERC-Environmental Information Data Centre. doi: https://doi.org/10.5285/518f88df-bfe7-442e-97ad-922b5aef003a

## Overview
- Metadata file describing a dataset of radionuclide activity concentrations in vertebrates (reptiles: lizards and snakes) and soil from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) for 2018.
- Managed and stored within the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EDC).
- Related to published work by Barnett et al. (2009) on radionuclide concentrations in CEZ reptiles.

## Dataset contents
- Species and samples:
  - Biota: reptiles (lizards or snakes); location includes Red Forest site 1 and Red Forest site 2.
  - Sample types include biota and soil.
  - Sample details include sex, body/total length, tail length, and fresh mass; notes indicate gut removal prior to analysis.
  - A specific sample code (Chornobyl Center sample code) identifies each sample.
- Radionuclides measured in biota (fresh mass):
  - Cs-137 (Bq/kg FM) with associated error (Cs-137_error_Bqkg_FM)
  - Sr-90 (Bq/kg FM) with associated error (Sr-90_error_Bqkg_FM)
  - Pu-239,240 (Bq/kg FM) with associated error (Pu-239,240_error_Bqkg_FM)
  - Pu-238 (Bq/kg FM) with associated error (Pu-238_error_Bqkg_FM)
- Radionuclide measured in soil (dry mass):
  - Cs-137 (Bq/kg DM) with associated error (Soil_Cs-137_error_Bqkg_DM)
- Metadata fields explicitly define units and explanations for each data column.

## Data quality, provenance and governance
- Data are accompanied by explicit metadata explaining column headings and units to enhance interpretability and reuse.
- Data centre: NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EDC).
- References for dataset context: Barnett, C.L., Gaschak, S., Beresford, N.A., Howard, B.J., Maksimenko, A. 2009. Radionuclide activity concentrations in two species of reptiles from the Chernobyl exclusion zone.
- Metadata supports transparency in measurement procedures, data transformations, and units, aiding quality assurance and data governance for monitoring frameworks.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Provides standardized, richly described radionuclide data for CEZ vertebrates and soil, suitable for comparative monitoring and trend assessment.
- Facilitates integration with other datasets by supplying clear variable definitions, units, and sample metadata.
- Supports assessment of environmental radiological health indicators in wildlife and the surrounding environment, informing policy decisions and future monitoring strategies.
