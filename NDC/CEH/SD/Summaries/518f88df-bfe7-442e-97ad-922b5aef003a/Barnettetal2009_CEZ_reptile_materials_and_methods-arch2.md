# Materials and methods for : Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, 2018

## Overview
- Describes materials, methods, and laboratory procedures used to quantify radionuclide activity concentrations in vertebrates (reptiles) from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ).
- Supports environmental monitoring and assessment of radiological health in wildlife, with data intended for standardized, quality-assured outputs.

## Data and organisms included
- Two reptile species analyzed: Lacerta agilis (sand lizard) and Natrix natrix (grass snake).
- Sampling at CEZ Red Forest sites:
  - Red Forest 1: ~2.6 km SW of Chernobyl NPP; area ~0.15 km².
  - Red Forest 2: ~2.7 km SW of Chernobyl NPP; area ~0.01 km².
- Timeframe for reptile data: 2000–2007 (seven-year period).
- Sample counts: 20 L. agilis and 5 N. natrix captured.
- Capture methods: L. agilis captured with Sherman traps (to target small rodents); N. natrix captured by hand.
- Tissue samples and preparation: whole-body analyses after removing gastrointestinal tract and washing carcasses; reptiles stored frozen.

## Field sampling and soils
- Soil sampling depth: 0–10 cm.
- CEZ Red Forest 1 soil sampling: 345 cores collected in June 2001.
- CEZ Red Forest 2 soil sampling: 4 cores collected in May 2007.
- Soil samples prepared by oven-drying and homogenising prior to analysis.

## Laboratory analyses and radionuclide measurements
- Target radionuclides in reptiles:
  - Cesium-137 (137Cs) and Strontium-90 (90Sr) in whole bodies.
  - Plutonium isotopes (238Pu and 239,240Pu) in reptiles.
- Reptile 137Cs measurement:
  - Whole-body samples placed in a box inside a lead-shielded counting container.
  - Detection via hyperpure germanium detector; 137Cs spectra analyzed with Canberra Genie 2000.
- Reptile 90Sr measurement:
  - Activity concentration derived from 90Sr via its daughter 90Y; detected with a thin-film NaI scintillation detector.
- Reptile Pu measurements:
  - Initial dissolution in 65% HNO3.
  - 242Pu added as a yield tracer.
  - Radiochemical separation by anion exchange (Bio Rad AG 1×8, 100–200 mesh) and co-precipitation.
  - Counting with a planar ion-implanted silicon detector.
- Soil analyses:
  - 137Cs: measured with Canberra hyper-pure germanium detectors; spectra analyzed with Genie 2000.
  - 40K: counting effort aimed for <20% counting error.
  - 90Sr in sub-samples via measurement of 90Y with thin-film NaI detector.
  - Pu isotopes in soils quantified using the Lx-radiation method (1323 keV) from excited uranium daughters following Pu α-decay, including self-absorption correction via Ba Kx radiation (32–37 keV) from 137Cs decay.
- Software and QA:
  - Genie 2000 software for gamma spectroscopy; standard radiochemical procedures validated in cited references.

## Data products and metadata
- Primary dataset: CEZ_reptile_data.csv (reptile radionuclide concentrations across species, sites, and years).
- Metadata: CEZ_reptile_metadata.rtf (accompanying documentation).
- Data Centre: NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (NERC-EIDC); DOI provided for dataset access.

## Quality, uncertainty, and validation
- Methodological validation against previously published procedures (Bondarkov et al.; related radioprotection and IAEA references).
- Uncertainty considerations noted, e.g., counting uncertainty aimed to be below specified thresholds (e.g., <20% for 40K in soil).
- Emphasis on standardized, validated laboratory techniques to ensure comparability and reliability across years and sites.

## Data access, reuse, and interoperability
- Data and metadata are organized for reuse within environmental monitoring frameworks.
- Encourages linking these reptile and soil radionuclide data with other CEZ datasets to enhance interpretability and utility for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring and policy performance
- Provides a standardized methodology for evaluating radiological contamination in CEZ wildlife, supporting temporal trend analysis and cross-site comparisons.
- Supports efforts to increase data value by enabling integration with additional datasets (e.g., other species, other environmental compartments) and by ensuring underlying data are accessible to stakeholders.
