# Materials and Methods for: Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Gaschak, S.P., Beresford, N.A., Barnett, C.L., Wells, C., Maksimenko, A. and Chaplow, J.S. NERCEnvironmental Information Data Centre. doi: https://doi.org/10.5285/518f88df-bfe7442e-97ad-922b5aef003a

## Overview
- Presents the Biota_radionuclide_data.csv dataset, drawing on Beresford et al. (2016) with additional unreported bat data around the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CZ) and data for ground-dwelling small mammals from Beresford et al. (2008).
- Builds on earlier work (Beresford et al. 2008, 2010; Bondarkov et al. 2011; Gaschak et al. 2010) to document radionuclide concentrations in vertebrates and associated soils.
- Provides methodological detail to support data reuse and reproducibility.

## Data Provenance and Scope
- Geographic scope: Chernobyl Exclusion Zone; site ~8 km west of the power plant complex.
- Taxonomic scope: passerine birds, bats, and ground-dwelling small mammals; additional data from multiple CZ sites (2004–2007 for bats; 2005 for passerines; 2008 for some mammals).
- Sample types: whole-body concentrations of 137Cs and 90Sr; Pu isotopes quantified in the same or related samples.
- Soil context: Beresford et al. (2008) provides soil activity concentrations at the Medium site and other sites used to frame animal data.

## Data Content and Metadata
- Primary measurements: whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr activity concentrations in vertebrates; Pu isotope concentrations determined via dissolution, separation, and counting.
- Supporting context: soil activity concentrations (from Beresford 2008) and sampling-area descriptions (sampling around home ranges, 200 m x 200 m grids, ~40,000 m² areas).
- Sample processing metadata: defrosting, removal of gastrointestinal tract or pelts/GIT as applicable, weighing, washing, and storage conditions prior to analysis.
- Analytical metadata: detector types (hyper-pure germanium for 137Cs; thin-film NaI for 90Sr; planar silicon detector for Pu isotopes), counting times (150–1200 s), calibration/validation against phantoms and radiochemical methods, and software used (Canberra Genie-2000).
- Uncertainty and quality indicators: counting errors typically <3% for 90Sr and <7% for 137Cs; Pu isotope counting errors typically <20%.
- Documentation references: Biota_radionuclide_data.csv is linked to Beresford et al. 2016 and Beresford et al. 2008; methods and QA are described in Bondarkov et al. (2011) and Gaschak et al. (2010).

## Methods and Quality Assurance
- Sample preparation: defrost, remove GIT (and pelt where applicable); weigh and wash prior to analysis.
- 137Cs measurement: whole-body gamma spectroscopy with HPGe detector; spectra analyzed with Genie-2000; counting times tailored to activity levels.
- 90Sr measurement: indirect determination via its decay product 90Y using NaI detector; calibration against phantoms; validated against traditional radiochemical methods.
- Pu isotope measurement: chemical digestion in 65% HNO3, addition of 242Pu as yield tracer, anion-exchange separation, co-precipitation; counting with planar silicon detector.
- Data integrity: methods and calibrations are explicitly documented; typical uncertainties provided to enable proper data interpretation.

## Data Access, Documentation, and Reuse
- Archive: dataset hosted in the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre.
- Related documentation: Biota_radionuclide_metadata.rtf (additional metadata and methodological context); primary publications cited for background data and methodology.
- Reuse considerations: the dataset integrates data from multiple studies with consistent measurement approaches and explicit QA details, enabling comparative analyses across species and sites within the CZ framework.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Considerations
- Provenance integrity: clear linkage to primary publications and methodological reports to ensure traceability of measurements.
- Metadata completeness: essential to capture site details, species, sample processing steps, detectors, counting times, units, and uncertainties to enable interoperability with other radionuclide datasets.
- Updates and interoperability: includes unreported data from bats and additional sites; stewardship should maintain versioning and cross-reference with underlying publications.
- Data quality indicators: provide uncertainty estimates and calibration/validation notes to support data quality assessment and meta-analyses.
- Compliance with data standards: align with environmental radiological data standards where possible; maintain traceable lineage to original methods and references.
