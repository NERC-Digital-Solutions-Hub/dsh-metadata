## Overview
- Study at three forest sites in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (designated Low, Medium, High by anticipated soil radionuclide activity).
- 100 m x 100 m study area at each site with trapping points at 10 m intervals.
- Trapping and radionuclide data collected in 2005 (July–August) as part of a broader assessment of radiation exposure in small mammals.
- Data cover soil radionuclide activity, small mammal body burdens, and dosimetry via collars with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs); linked to previously published methods (ERICA Tool reference and Bondarkov et al. work).

## Data Collected
- Site and sampling design
  - Three sites (Low, Medium, High) with marking at 10 m intervals for 100 m x 100 m plots.
  - Trapping points established; random sampling used for soil collection.
- Soil sampling and measurement
  - 23 soil samples per site, depth 10 cm, GPS locations recorded.
  - Soil sampling area extended to 50 m beyond trapping area to cover likely home ranges.
  - Gamma-kerma rates measured at 5 cm above ground using MKS-01R-01 with BDKB-01R detector; three 10 s measurements per point (mean used).
  - Data used for site comparison of soil radionuclide activity concentrations.
- Radionuclide analyses in soils
  - 238, 239, 240 Pu activity concentrations determined by Lx-radiation method (13–23 keV) with absorption corrections via Ba-133, using 10 g dry weight (DW) sub-samples.
  - 90Sr activity concentrations determined via 90Y decay using a thin-film NaI detector, with calibration against phantoms; 10 g DW sub-samples.
  - For Medium/Low sites, ~750 g DW per sample; for High site, ~130 g DW per sample.
  - Detection limits and accuracy: Pu method detection limit 3–5 Bq with 10–15% accuracy; 90Sr method accuracy validated against radiochemical methods.
- Vertebrate trapping and dosimetry
  - 14 trapping occasions; 100 Sherman traps per sampling area; baited with rolled oats; traps opened next day.
  - Species processed: Apodemus flavicollis (Yellow-necked mouse), Myodes glareolus (Bank vole), Microtus spp. (voles).
  - First capture: fitted with a numbered collar carrying a LiF-100 TLD; live-weight recorded.
  - Whole-body activity measured for 137Cs and 90Sr using a paired Ge detector and NaI detector after humane counting in a shielded container.
  - Spectra analyzed with Genie-2000 software; count times ranged 150–1200 s depending on activity.
  - Recapture protocol: if recaptured >14 days after collar fitting, TLD removed, body weights re-measured, 137Cs and 90Sr re-determined; if recaptured ≤14 days, location recorded and released (additional Cs measurements available where possible).
  - 230 TLD collars fitted; 85 recovered; recovery duration 6–36 days.
  - Controls: 7 TLD collars transported to UK and left as controls.
  - TLD deployment in field: four randomly selected trapping points per site, TLDs placed at 5 cm above ground, at ground level, and 10 cm deep; one TLD per position, with a second encapsulated in a Perspex cube for a subset; 25 of 36 paired TLDs recovered.
  - Recovered TLDs and site TLDs returned to supplier for analysis.

## Measurement Methods and Calibration
- Gamma and radiometric measurements
  - 40K and other gamma-emitting radionuclides measured via high-purity detectors; counting times selected to achieve specified uncertainties.
  - Pu Lx method validated against radiochemical analyses; specificity to 238–240Pu based on X-ray emission following alpha-decay.
  - 90Sr activity derived from 90Y measurements; calibration against radiochemical standards (phantoms used for verification).
- Data processing and quality
  - Genie-2000 software used for 137Cs spectral analysis.
  - Count-time strategies chosen to achieve <20% error on 40K estimates.
  - Calibration and accuracy details provided in related Bondarkov et al. references.

## Data Management and Accessibility
- Data stored and managed under the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (NERC EIDC).
- Related metadata and methods referenced to ERICA framework; ERICA_metadata.rtf referenced for metadata context.
- Datasets include site locations, soil gamma-kerma, soil radionuclide concentrations (Pu isotopes, 90Sr), vertebrate body burdens (137Cs, 90Sr), trap locations, animal IDs, collar IDs, and TLD results.
- Provisions for dataset updates and sharing to respect sharing limitations and update mechanisms.

## Data Quality, Uncertainties, and Limitations
- Uncertainties specified for key measurements (e.g., <20% for 40K, 10–15% for Pu-based Lx method, validated against radiochemical methods).
- Data gaps due to incomplete TLD recoveries (85/230 collars recovered; some TLDs lost or left as controls).
- Spatial and temporal scope limited to a single trapping season (July–August 2005) with multiple sites of differing soil types and vegetation.
- Potential biases due to varying trap catchability, site-specific soil characteristics, and incomplete dataset recoveries.

## Practical Considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure comprehensive metadata coverage: site identifiers, GPS coordinates, trap and collar IDs, sampling depths, measurement instruments, detection limits, calibration curves, QA steps, and data processing workflows.
- Maintain clear linkage between soil radionuclide data and vertebrate burden data via shared site and sampling identifiers.
- Preserve raw counts, derived activity concentrations, and dose-related metrics with traceable processing steps (software versions, spectral analysis parameters).
- Document data limitations, recovery rates, and any post-hoc adjustments to ensure transparent reuse.
- Align datasets with existing standards for radiological environmental data to facilitate interoperability and discovery.
