# Metadata (an explanation of column headings and units) for: Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, 2018

## Overview
- Describes metadata for the Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, 2018 study.
- Data file: CEZ_reptile_data.csv; related materials: Materials_and_methods_CEZ_reptile.rtf.
- Curated by NERC Environmental Information Data Centre; dataset DOI provided.
- Focuses on radionuclide activity concentrations in reptiles (and associated soil) from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, with measurements including Cs-137, Sr-90, Pu isotopes.
- Enables data reuse and cross-study comparison through explicit column explanations and units; references Barnett et al., 2009 for site context.

## Data structure and content
- Primary data file: CEZ_reptile_data.csv.
- Columns (with explanations and units): Chornobyl_Center_sample_code, Sample (lizard or soil), Biota_latin_name, Depth_of_soil_layer_collected_cm (cm), Location (Red Forest site 1 or site 2), Date_snake_or_lizard_or_soil_sampled (dd/mm/yyyy), Sex_of_snake_or_lizard, Lizard_or_snake_total_length_mm, Lizard_tail_length_mm, Lizard_body_length_mm, Fresh_mass_of_snake_or_lizard_grams, Fresh_mass_of_snake_or_lizard_carcass_grams, Notes (e.g., guts removed).
- Radionuclide measurements and related data: Cs-137_Bqkg_FM, Cs-137_error_Bqkg_FM, Sr-90_Bqkg_FM, Sr-90_error_Bqkg_FM, Pu-239,240_Bqkg, Pu-239,240_error_Bqkg_FM, Pu-238_Bqkg_FM, Pu-238_error_Bqkg_FM, Soil_Cs-137_Bqkg_DM, Soil_Cs-137_error_Bqkg_DM.
- Units include Bq per kg (fresh mass or dry mass), and physical measurements in mm, cm, g.
- Sample types include biota (lizard) and soil; notes indicate processing details (e.g., guts removed before analysis).

## Measurement details and provenance
- Measurements include multiple radionuclides: Cs-137, Sr-90 in biota; Pu isotopes (Pu-239, Pu-240, Pu-238) in biota; Cs-137 in soil (dry mass).
- Distinguishes units by context: fresh mass (FM) for biota, dry mass (DM) for soil.
- Date and location fields provide temporal and geographic context; location references to Red Forest sites with further details in Barnett et al., 2009.
- Gaps and data quality aspects are addressed through explicit error terms (e.g., Cs-137_error_Bqkg_FM).

## Data quality, standards, and metadata practices
- Each column is explained with its units, enabling clear data interpretation and reuse.
- Uses standardized date format and location naming to support interoperability.
- Metadata aligns with environmental data centre practices, enhancing discoverability and provenance.
- Includes provenance links to primary literature for site context and a dedicated data centre DOI.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates robust data governance through comprehensive column-level metadata and units.
- Facilitates data discovery, interoperability, and reuse by providing explicit data types, units, and provenance.
- Supports cross-dataset analyses (e.g., comparing radionuclide concentrations across species, locations, and sample types) via standardized measurements (Bq/kg, FM/DM).
- Highlights the importance of linking data products to methodological notes (Materials_and_methods) and primary literature for fuller context.
