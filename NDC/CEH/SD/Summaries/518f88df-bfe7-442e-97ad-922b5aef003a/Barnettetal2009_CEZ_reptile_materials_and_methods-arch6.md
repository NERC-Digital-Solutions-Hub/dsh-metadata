## Overview
- Provides radionuclide activity concentrations in two reptile species (Lacerta agilis and Natrix natrix) and soils from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, covering 2000–2007.
- Data accompany a CSV dataset (CEZ_reptile_data.csv) and related metadata (CEZ_reptile_metadata.rtf).
- Describes sampling sites, specimen numbers, storage, and laboratory methods used to quantify 137Cs, 90Sr, 238Pu, 239,240Pu, and 40K.

## Data collected
- Reptile species and numbers:
  - Lacerta agilis (sand lizard): 20 individuals
  - Natrix natrix (grass snake): 5 individuals
- Trapping sites:
  - Red Forest 1 (RF1): location near Chernobyl plant; triangular area ~0.15 km²
  - Red Forest 2 (RF2): location near Chernobyl plant; square area ~0.01 km²
- Sample processing:
  - Whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr contents measured
  - 238Pu and 239,240Pu measured in reptiles
  - GI tract removed; carcass washed
- Soil data:
  - Soil samples from 0–10 cm depth
  - RF1: 345 cores collected (June 2001)
  - RF2: 4 cores collected (May 2007)

## Sampling design and site details
- RF1: ~0.15 km² triangular area, ~2.6 km SW of Chernobyl NPP
- RF2: ~0.01 km² square area, ~2.7 km SW of Chernobyl NPP
- Reptile capture:
  - L. agilis trapped in Sherman traps; N. natrix captured by hand
- Sample handling:
  - Reptiles stored frozen
  - Soils analyzed after drying and homogenisation

## Measurements and laboratory methods
- Reptile analyses:
  - 137Cs and 90Sr quantified in whole body
  - 90Sr activity derived from its daughter 90Y
  - Pu analyses: 238Pu and 239,240Pu via radiochemical separation
- Detectors and analysis:
  - 137Cs: hyperpure germanium detector; spectra via Canberra Genie 2000
  - 90Sr: thin-film NaI scintillation detector to measure 90Y
  - Pu: digestion in 65% HNO3; radioactive yield tracer 242Pu; anion exchange (Bio Rad AG 1×8) and co-precipitation; counted with planar ion-implanted silicon detector
- Soil analyses:
  - 0–10 cm samples measured with Canberra HPGe detectors; Genie 2000 used for 137Cs and 40K
  - 40K estimation targeted counting error <20%
  - 90Sr in soils determined via 90Y with NaI detector
  - 238Pu/239,240Pu in soils assessed using Lx-radiation following Pu decay; self-absorption correction using Ba (32–37 keV) data
- Data products:
  - Reptile activity concentrations for 137Cs, 90Sr, 238Pu, and 239,240Pu
  - Soil activity concentrations for 137Cs, 40K, 90Sr, 238Pu, 239,240Pu

## Data processing and quality assurance
- 90Sr in reptiles calculated from 90Y activities
- Reptile data quality validated by prior work (Bondarkov et al., 2002a,b)
- QA target: counting error for 40K < 20%
- Soil measurements rely on established Canberra Genie 2000 workflow and referenced methodologies
- Metadata and related materials:
  - CEZ_reptile_data.csv (data file)
  - CEZ_reptile_metadata.rtf (metadata/documentation)
  - References to supporting methodological literature provided

## Data access and usage notes
- Data and methods are archived in the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre
- DOI provided for data package access
- Suitable for cross-site comparisons of radionuclide burdens in wildlife and soils within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone; supports radioprotection and ecological exposure assessments
