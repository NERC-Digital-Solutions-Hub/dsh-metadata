# Materials and Methods for: Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone

- Overview
  - Describes the Biota_radionuclide_data.csv dataset, combining Beresford et al. (2016) data with additional unreported bat data around the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and data for ground-dwelling small mammals from Beresford et al. (2008).
  - Focuses on radionuclide concentrations (137Cs, 90Sr, Pu isotopes) in vertebrate species (birds, bats, small mammals) within and around the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
  - Site context: Beresford et al. (2016) site about 8 km west of the Chernobyl NPP; woodland mainly Scots pine, oak, with sparse understorey; soils of soddy pseudopodzolic type on modern alluvial deposits.
  - Historical soil data (Beresford et al. 2008) from the Medium site and 50 m extended sampling area (200 m x 200 m) for home ranges; soil activity concentrations reported for 137Cs, 238,239,240Pu, and 90Sr.

- Data sources and scope
  - Primary data from Beresford et al. (2016) with additional unreported bat data from sites around the Exclusion Zone; and ground-dwelling mammals from Beresford et al. (2008).
  - Includes a range of passerines collected by mist netting in June 2005 (euthanized and frozen) and three bat species collected May–June 2008 (euthanized and frozen); additional bats from 2004–2007 across various sites.
  - Live-monitoring data for 90Sr and 137Cs exists in Beresford et al. (2008) for Apodemus flavicollis, Myodes glareolus, and Microtus spp.

- Sampling and preparation
  - Pre-analysis: samples defrosted; birds and bats: GIT removed; ground-dwelling mammals: pelt and GIT removed; samples weighed and washed.
  - Whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr concentrations measured.
  - Carcasses placed in small boxes inside lead-shielded counting containers for counting.

- Analytical methods
  - 137Cs activity measured with a hyper-pure germanium detector; 90Sr measured with a thin-film NaI detector.
  - 137Cs spectra analyzed with Canberra Genie-2000 software.
  - 90Sr activity derived from its daughter 90Y.
  - Calibration/validation against phantoms and traditional radiochemical methods reported.
  - Pu isotopes: samples dissolved in 65% HNO3; 242Pu added as a yield tracer; anion-exchange separation (Bio Rad AG 1 x 8); co-precipitation; counting with a planar ion-implanted silicon detector.
  - Counting times ranged from 150 to 1200 seconds; counting errors typically <3% for 90Sr and <7% for 137Cs; Pu isotopes with typical errors <20%.

- Data details and content
  - Biota_radionuclide_data.csv contains measurements for vertebrates from the Exclusion Zone, plus additional bat data around the zone and small mammals from the Beresford et al. (2008) study.
  - Soil data (from Beresford et al. 2008) for the Medium site include mean ± SD values: 137Cs, 238,239,240Pu, and 90Sr; notable variability but no clear spatial pattern across the site.
  - Sampling design for soils covered a 200 m x 200 m area around animal trapping sites to reflect home ranges.
  - Methodological details include animal preparation steps and counting setups (e.g., box construction and shielding) to ensure reproducibility.

- Data quality, limitations, and context
  - Counting errors and calibration procedures disclosed; reliance on yield tracer for Pu isotopes indicates an emphasis on accuracy.
  - Some data come from live-monitoring (2008) in Beresford et al. (2008), which may differ from post-mmortem analyses.
  - Additional unreported bat data enhance geographic and species coverage around the Exclusion Zone.
