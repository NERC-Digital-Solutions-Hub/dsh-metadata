# Materials and methods for: Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, 2018, Gaschak, S.P., Beresford, N.A., Barnett, C.L., Wells, C., Maksimenko, A. and Chaplow, J.S.

- Objective and study design
  - Compare three forest sites within the Chernobyl exclusion zone (Low, Medium, High) anticipated to have differing soil radionuclide activity.
  - Layout: 100 m x 100 m study areas marked with posts at 10 m intervals; trapping locations based on this grid.
  - Timeframe: Trapping conducted on 14 occasions from early July to mid-August 2005.
  - Species targeted: Apodemus flavicollis (Yellow-necked mouse), Myodes glareolus (Bank vole), and Microtus spp. (vole species).

- Site and habitat descriptions
  - Low site: SE of reactor 4; Scots pine-dominated with sparse understorey; soddy pseudopodzolic to podzolic-sandy soils.
  - Medium site: West of reactor complex; mix of pine, oak, rowan, lime; ground cover with bracken; sandy and boggy soils on alluvial deposits.
  - High site: Young conifer plantation; ground cover dominated by grasses with ericaceous species; bog peat and soddy pseudopodzolic sandy soils.

- Environmental measurements
  - Gamma-kerma rates measured at 5 cm above ground at each trapping point using a MKS-01R-01 dose rate meter with a BDKB-01R detector; three 10 s measurements per point.
  - Location of trapping points recorded with handheld GPS.

- Soil sampling and laboratory analyses
  - 23 soil samples per site collected to 10 cm depth; sampling area extended to 50 m beyond trapping area to cover likely home ranges.
  - Samples dried and homogenised; 750 g dry weight analysed per sample (Medium/Low sites) or ~130 g DW (High site).
  - Gamma-emitting radionuclides: activity concentrations determined by hyper-pure germanium detectors; spectra analysed with Genie-2000; count times chosen to achieve <20% error on 40K.
  - Plutonium isotopes (238, 239, 240 Pu): determined in 10 g DW sub-samples using Lx-radiation method (based on excited uranium daughter isotopes) with self-absorption correction.
  - Strontium-90: measured in 10 g DW sub-samples via 90Y activity using a thin-film NaI scintillation detector; calibration as per Bondarkov et al. (2002).

- Trapping and animal handling
  - 100 Sherman traps per site deployed; baited with rolled oats; traps opened in late evening and checked the following day.
  - Trapping occurred at the study area posts; each animal’s trapping location recorded.
  - First capture of an animal: fitted with a numbered collar containing a LiF-100 thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD).
  - Live-weight recorded; whole-body content of 137Cs and 90Sr measured using described counting methods.
  - Counting setup: small cardboard box with polyethylene lid, placed inside a lead-shielded counting container; detectors included a Ge detector and a thin-film NaI detector; 40K spectra analysed with Genie-2000.
  - Count times ranged from 150 to 1200 seconds, depending on radioactivity.

- Dosimetry and recapture protocol
  - After live-monitoring, animals released at their trapping point.
  - If recaptured >14 days after collar fitting: remove TLD, reweigh, remeasure whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr.
  - If recaptured <14 days after fitting: record trapping location and release; additional Cs measurements as available.
  - In the last two weeks, TLDs removed if recaptured within 6 days of fitting.
  - Total: 230 TLD collars fitted; 85 recovered; collar duration ranged from 6 to 36 days.
  - Some TLDs were transported to the UK as controls (7 collars).

- Additional TLD deployment and recovery
  - At four randomly selected trapping points per site, place TLDs at four positions: 5 cm above ground, ground level, 10 cm deep, and a paired Perspex-encased unit.
  - Of the 36 possible paired TLDs, 25 were recovered; remaining lost.
  - Recovered TLDs from animals and sites sent back to supplier for analysis along with control TLDs.

- Data and quality considerations
  - Laboratory methods referenced with validated calibration approaches (Bondarkov et al. 2002a-d), including non-radiochemical techniques for 90Sr and validation against phantoms.
  - Error characteristics stated for key measurements (e.g., <20% for 40K; Pu/Sr method accuracies around 10–15%).
  - Metadata important for interpretation (trap locations, site descriptors, sampling depths, timing) and GPS coordinates were recorded to facilitate analysis and reproducibility.

- References and lineage
  - Builds on ERICA Tool application and methodologies (Beresford et al., 2008) and prior related radiological analyses (Bondarkov et al., 2002a–d) to estimate exposure and decontamination parameters in small mammals.
