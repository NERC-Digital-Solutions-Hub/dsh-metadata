# Materials and Methods for: Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Gaschak, S.P., Beresford, N.A., Barnett, C.L., Wells, C., Maksimenko, A. and Chaplow, J.S. NERCEnvironmental Information Data Centre. doi: https://doi.org/10.5285/518f88df-bfe7442e-97ad-922b5aef003a, 2018.

## Overview
- Presents the Biota_radionuclide_data.csv dataset for radionuclide concentrations (137Cs, Pu isotopes, 90Sr) in vertebrates from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CZ), with additional unreported bat data from sites around CZ.
- Builds on Beresford et al. (2016) and Beresford et al. (2008), incorporating supplementary data from Gaschak et al. (2010) on bats.
- Aims to document transfer of radionuclides to birds, bats, and ground-dwelling small mammals and to provide methodological detail for data interpretation and QA.

## Data content and provenance
- Data source: Beresford et al. (2016) with added unreported bat data; supplementary site details from Gaschak et al. (2010) and Beresford et al. (2008, 2005–2007 era).
- Dataset focus: whole-body activity concentrations of 137Cs and 90Sr, and Pu isotopes in selected vertebrate groups.
- Data file: Biota_radionuclide_data.csv; metadata references in Biota_radionuclide_metadata.rtf.
- Site context: CZ site approximately 8 km west of the Chernobyl power plant; woodland dominated by Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur with sparse understorey.

## Site description and sampling details
- Soil context (Medium site) described in Beresford et al. (2008):
  - Soil area around animal sampling: about 200 m x 200 m (40,000 m²) extending 50 m beyond trapping area to capture home ranges.
  - Reported soil activity concentrations (mean ± SD) for a representative site: 137Cs = 43.3 ± 25.7; Pu isotopes = 0.83 ± 1.49; 90Sr = 18.6 ± 14 kBq kg⁻¹ dry mass.
- Biological sampling:
  - Passerine birds: mist nets at the main site during June 2005; euthanised and frozen.
  - Bats: three species collected May–June 2008 via mist nets; additional bats collected across CZ between 2004–2007.
  - Ground-dwelling small mammals: captured at additional sites; some results reported in Beresford et al. (2008).
- Specimen preparation (before analysis):
  - Defrosting, removal of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) for birds and bats; removal of pelage and GIT for small mammals.
  - Weighing and washing of prepared samples prior to counting.

## Analytical methods
- 137Cs and 90Sr analysis:
  - Whole-body concentrations measured using gamma counting and beta-detector approaches.
  - Sample containment: carcasses placed in a cardboard box with a thin polyethylene top, inside a lead-shielded counting container.
  - Detectors: hyper-pure germanium detector for 137Cs; thin-film (1 mm) NaI detector for 90Sr (via its daughter 90Y).
  - 137Cs spectra analyzed with Canberra Genie-2000 software.
  - 90Sr activity derived from 90Y measurements.
  - Calibration/validation: method calibrated against phantoms containing 137Cs and 90Sr; validated against traditional radiochemical methods.
  - Counting times: 150–1200 s depending on activity.
  - Reported counting errors: typically <3% for 90Sr and <7% for 137Cs.
- Pu isotopes analysis:
  - Sample digestion: dissolution in 65% HNO3 with 242Pu added as a yield tracer.
  - Separation: anion exchange (Bio Rad AG 1 x 8, 100–200 mesh) followed by co-precipitation.
  - Measurement: counted with a planar ion-implanted silicon detector.
  - Counting errors: typically <20% for Pu isotopes.

## Data quality, QA, and interpretation
- Data provenance and traceability:
  - Clear linkage to Beresford et al. (2016) and Beresford et al. (2008) methodologies.
  - Additional data incorporated with explicit mention of unreported bat data and broader site coverage (Gaschak 2010 context).
- Method validation:
  - Cross-validation against radiochemical methods and phantom calibrations to ensure reliability of 137Cs and 90Sr measurements.
- Data coverage:
  - Includes species not previously reported in Beresford et al. (2008) and additional Pu isotope data.
  - Soil context and sampling design documented to support interpretation of bioaccumulation relative to home range and habitat.
