# Materials and methods for: Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, 2018

## Overview
- Three forest sites (Low, Medium, High) within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone were selected to reflect differing soil radionuclide activity concentrations.
- A 100 m × 100 m study area at each site was established with trapping points at 10 m intervals.
- Target small mammal species: Apodemus flavicollis (Yellow-necked mouse), Myodes glareolus (Bank vole), and Microtus spp. (Vole species).
- Aimed to generate standardized radionuclide data in vertebrates and soils to support environmental health assessments and exposure estimations.

## Field design and site characterization
- Habitat characterizations described for each site, including dominant tree species and soil types (e.g., soddy pseudopodzolic soils, podzolic-sandy loamy soils, boggy soils; presence of Scots pine, oaks, birch, heathers, etc.).
- Gamma-kerma rates measured at 5 cm above ground at each trapping point using a MKS-01R-01 dose rate meter with a BDKB-01R detector; three 10 s readings averaged per point; GPS used for trap point locations.

## Soil sampling and laboratory analyses
- 23 soil samples collected per site from depths of 0–10 cm; sampling area extended to 50 m beyond trapping area to cover likely mammal home ranges; samples dried and homogenised.
- Gamma-emitting radionuclides in soil analyzed with hyper-pure germanium detectors; spectra processed with Genie-2000; count times chosen to achieve <20% error on 40K estimates.
- 238,239,240 Pu activity in soils determined from 10 g dry weight subsamples using the Lx radiation method (13–23 keV) from excited uranium daughters, with self-absorption correction via Ba Kx radiation from 137Cs; detection limit 3–5 Bq; accuracy 10–15%.
- 90Sr activity in soils determined from 10 g dry weight subsamples via measurement of 90Y activity using a thin-film NaI detector; calibration described by Bondarkov et al. (2002c).

## Trapping, tagging, and dosimetry in vertebrates
- Trapping conducted on 14 occasions from early July to mid-August 2005; 100 Sherman humane traps per site baited with rolled oats; traps checked next morning; animals tagged and processed.
- Live individuals fitted with LiF-100 thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) collars to measure whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr; recorded live weight; whole-body activity concentrations determined post-counting.
- Counting performed in a lead-shielded container using a hyper-pure germanium detector (for 137Cs) and a thin-film NaI detector (for 90Sr); 137Cs spectra analyzed with Genie-2000; 90Sr via its daughter 90Y; count times ranged from 150 to 1200 s depending on activity.
- Recapture protocol: if recaptured >14 days after collaring, collars removed, animals reweighed, and Cs/Sr re-measured; if recaptured ≤14 days after collaring, trapping location recorded and animal released (some additional Cs measurements possible if available).
- Total of 230 TLD collars fitted; 85 recovered; collar duration ranged from 6 to 36 days. Seven TLDs were shipped to the UK for use as controls.
- At four randomly selected trapping points per site, TLDs were placed in three positions (5 cm above ground, at ground level, and 10 cm depth) with a second paired in a Perspex cube; 25 of 36 paired TLDs recovered.
- Recovered TLDs and site-contained TLDs were sent back to the supplier for analysis, alongside control TLDs.

## Data preparation, quality, and outputs
- Data types include: soil radionuclide activity concentrations (K-40, Pu isotopes, 90Sr), gamma dose rates at trap points, and vertebrate whole-body radionuclide contents (137Cs, 90Sr) plus internal dosimetry from TLDs.
- Methodologies referenced follow Bondarkov et al. (2002a-d) for non-radiochemical determinations and calibrations; methods validated against radiochemical procedures.
- Data intended for inclusion in environmental information portals; outputs expected as structured datasets, suitable for exposure assessment and monitoring performance analyses.
