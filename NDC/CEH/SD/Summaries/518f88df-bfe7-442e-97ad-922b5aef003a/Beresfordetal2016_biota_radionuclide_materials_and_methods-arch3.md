## Overview
- Presents data and methodologies for radionuclide concentrations (137Cs, 90Sr, Pu isotopes) in vertebrates from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
- Builds on Beresford et al. (2016) and Beresford et al. (2008), with additional unreported bat data from sites around the Exclusion Zone.
- Data are compiled in Biota_radionuclide_data.csv and linked to site and soil information from related studies.

## Data included
- Whole-body activity concentrations for 137Cs and 90Sr in vertebrates (birds, bats, ground-dwelling small mammals).
- Additional data for Pu isotopes (after digestion and separation) for some samples.
- Site descriptions and soil context to support interpretation of uptake and transfer (Medium site, approx. 8 km west of the Chernobyl power plant; pine/oak woodland with limited understorey).
- Supplemental soil activity concentrations reported in Beresford et al. (2008) for comparison and context.

## Sampling design and sites
- Primary study site (Medium site) used in Beresford et al. (2008): 200 m x 200 m sampling area within soils extending 50 m beyond animal trapping area.
- Collected organisms:
  - Passerine birds (June 2005) via mist nets; euthanised and frozen.
  - Bats (May–June 2008) via mist nets; euthanised and frozen; additional bats from multiple sites (2004–2007) included.
  - Ground-dwelling small mammals (sampling described in Beresford et al. 2008) with live-monitoring data referenced.
- Soil data: 23 soil samples from the Medium site; broader soil context from Beresford et al. (2008) for additional sites.

## Sample processing
- Tissue preparation:
  - Bird carcasses: plucked, gastrointestinal tract removed.
  - Bat samples: gastrointestinal tract removed.
  - Ground-dwelling small mammals: fur and GIT removed.
- Samples dried/ weighed and washed before analysis.
- Whole-body processing followed standardized preparation prior to radiometric measurement.

## Analytical methods
- 137Cs and 90Sr measurement:
  - Whole-body samples counted in lead-shielded containers.
  - Detection: hyper-pure germanium detector for 137Cs; thin-film NaI detector for 90Sr (via 90Y daughter).
  - 137Cs spectra analyzed with Canberra Genie-2000 software.
  - 90Sr activity inferred from 90Y.
  - Counting times: 150–1200 s depending on radioactivity.
  - Reported counting errors: typically <3% for 90Sr and <7% for 137Cs.
  - Calibration/validation: method calibrated against phantoms; validated against traditional radiochemical extraction methodologies.
- Pu isotopes:
  - Samples dissolved in 65% HNO3 with 242Pu as a yield tracer.
  - Anion-exchange separation (Bio Rad AG 1 x 8) followed by co-precipitation.
  - Counted using a planar ion-implanted silicon detector.
  - Counting errors typically <20%.

## Data quality, provenance, and governance
- Data derived from published studies (Beresford et al. 2008; Beresford et al. 2016) with additional unreported bat data.
- Detailed methodology supports reproducibility and data integrity for monitoring frameworks assessing contaminant transfer to wildlife.
- Metadata reference: Biota_radionuclide_metadata.rtf (linked to dataset for context and documentation).
- Data are organized in Biota_radionuclide_data.csv, with site-specific and species-specific context included.

## Data usage and implications for monitoring frameworks
- Enables assessment of environmental radiological health indicators across vertebrate taxa in a contaminated zone.
- Supports cross-site comparisons and temporal analyses through standardized measurement and reporting approaches.
- Highlights importance of robust metadata, transparent methodology, and data provenance for governance and decision-making in environmental monitoring.
- Demonstrates integration of field sampling, laboratory measurement, data processing, and calibration/validation to produce policy-relevant datasets.
