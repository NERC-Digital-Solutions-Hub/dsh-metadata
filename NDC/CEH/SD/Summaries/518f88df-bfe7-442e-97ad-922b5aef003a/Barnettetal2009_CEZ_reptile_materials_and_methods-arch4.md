# Materials and methods for : Radionuclide data for vertebrates in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, 2018

- Overview of the dataset
  - Radionuclide activity concentrations in vertebrates (two reptile species) from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, spanning 2000–2007.
  - Species: Lacerta agilis (sand lizard) and Natrix natrix (grass snake).
  - Sites: Red Forest 1 and Red Forest 2, with precise coordinates and differing sampling areas.
  - Data components include whole-body activities for 137Cs and 90Sr in reptiles, and activity concentrations for 238Pu and 239,240Pu; soils (0–10 cm) also analyzed.

- Data assets and content
  - CEZ_reptile_data.csv: compiled reptile radionuclide data across the seven-year period.
  - Soils: 345 cores at Red Forest 1 (June 2001) and 4 cores at Red Forest 2 (May 2007).
  - Metadata reference: CEZ_reptile_metadata.rtf (metadata document for dataset context and structure).

- Sampling design and collection
  - Locations: Red Forest 1 (E 30.06188, N 51.38427; ~2.6 km SW of Chernobyl NPP) and Red Forest 2 (E 30.06405, N 51.38095; ~2.7 km SW; ~0.01–0.15 km2 area variations).
  - Trapping and catching:
    - Lacerta agilis captured primarily in Sherman traps; Natrix natrix captured by hand.
  - Specimen handling:
    - Whole-body radionuclide content measured after removing gastrointestinal tracts and washing carcasses; soils oven-dried and homogenised pre-analysis.

- Measurement methods and instruments
  - Reptiles:
    - 137Cs: measured with a hyperpure germanium detector; spectra analysed with Canberra Genie 2000.
    - 90Sr: measured via its daughter 90Y using NaI detector.
  - Plutonium isotopes:
    - 238Pu and 239,240Pu: radiochemical separation, dissolution in 65% HNO3; yield tracer 242Pu; anion exchange and co-precipitation; counted with a planar ion-implanted silicon detector.
  - Soils:
    - 137Cs: measured with Canberra HPGe detectors; Genie 2000 for spectra.
    - 90Sr: sub-samples measured via 90Y activity with thin-film NaI detector.
    - 238/239/240Pu: activity via Lx radiation (1323 keV) after separation; self-absorption corrections using Ba-133 daughter data.
  - Quality targets:
    - Counting error for 40K in soils targeted to be <20%.

- Data quality, validation, and provenance
  - Method references for validation include Bondarkov et al. (2002a,b) and related works (publications cited within the document).
  - Validation and cross-method references underpin the reliability of radionuclide measurements and yield tracing.

- Temporal and spatial coverage
  - Timeframe: 2000–2007 for reptile sampling and analysis; soil sampling occurred in 2001 (Red Forest 1) and 2007 (Red Forest 2).
  - Spatial scope: Two Red Forest sites near the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone with specific coordinates and area descriptions.

- Data governance, access, and reuse
  - Data storage and access: NERC Environmental Information Data Centre; dataset associated with a DOI.
  - Available files: CEZ_reptile_data.csv (primary data) and CEZ_reptile_metadata.rtf (metadata).
  - Purpose and usability: enables assessment of radionuclide burden in non-human wildlife and supports comparative analyses and environmental risk assessments across sites and years.

- Notes for data leaders (implications for data strategy)
  - Emphasize standardized metadata and documentation to ensure cross-study comparability (methods, detectors, calibration, and analysis pipelines).
  - Maintain traceability to original methodological references and lab protocols.
  - Ensure discoverability and long-term accessibility of data and metadata (institutional repositories, DOIs).
  - Facilitate integration with broader environmental radiation datasets (soil and biota) to support networks and communities of practice focused on radioprotection and wildlife contamination.
