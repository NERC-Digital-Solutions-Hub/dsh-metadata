NERCEnvironmental Information Data Centre. doi: https://doi.org/10.5285/518f88df-bfe7442e-97ad-922b5aef003a, 2018.

## Overview and scope
- Data presented for the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, drawn from Beresford et al. (2016) with additional unreported bat data from sites around the Exclusion Zone, and from ground-dwelling small mammals at sites described in Beresford et al. (2008).
- Primary data asset: Biota_radionuclide_data.csv, plus related soils data related to Beresford et al. (2008) and additional metadata (Biota_radionuclide_metadata.rtf).
- Site context: main study site approximately 8 km west of the Chernobyl power plant; woodland dominated by Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur with sparse understorey; soils described as soddy pseudopodzolic on modern alluvial deposits.
- Soils (Beresford 2008) collected over a 200 m x 200 m area around the animal sampling area (extended 50 m beyond) to capture likely home ranges; reported soil activity concentrations for 137Cs, 238/239/240Pu, and 90Sr with means and standard deviations (e.g., 43.3±25.7, 0.83±1.49, 18.6±14.9 kBq kg-1 dry mass for 137Cs, Pu isotopes, and 90Sr, respectively).
- Data cover a range of vertebrates: passerine birds, multiple bat species, and ground-dwelling small mammals.

## Sampling and specimens
- Vertebrate sampling methods:
  - Passerine birds captured with mist nets at the main study site during June 2005; specimens euthanised and stored frozen.
  - Bats sampled May–June 2008 using mist nets; three bat species collected at the main site; additional bats from across the Exclusion Zone collected 2004–2007.
- Preparation before analysis:
  - Bird carcasses plucked; gastrointestinal tract removed; bat samples had GIT removed; ground-dwelling mammals had pelt and GIT removed.
  - All prepared samples weighed, washed, and stored frozen.
- Broader context:
  - Live-monitoring data for some species reported in Beresford et al. (2008) and Bondarkov et al. (2011) results.

## Analytical methods
- 137Cs and 90Sr measurement in whole-body samples:
  - Sample preparation followed established protocols; carcasses placed in a small disposable box inside a lead-shielded counting container.
  - Detection systems: hyper-pure germanium detector for 137Cs and a thin-film NaI detector (1 mm) for 90Sr (via 90Y).
  - Spectral analysis performed with Canberra Genie-2000 software.
  - 90Sr activity derived from 90Y; 137Cs spectra analyzed directly.
  - Counting times ranged from 150 to 1200 seconds, depending on activity; typical counting errors: <3% for 90Sr and <7% for 137Cs.
- Pu isotopes measurement:
  - Samples dissolved in 65% HNO3; 242Pu added as a yield tracer.
  - Anion exchange separation (Bio Rad AG 1 x 8, 100–200 mesh) followed by co-precipitation.
  - Counted with a planar ion-implanted silicon detector.
  - Counting errors typically <20% for Pu isotopes.
- Calibration and validation:
  - Method calibrated against phantoms containing 137Cs and 90Sr.
  - Validated against traditional radiochemical extraction and analysis methods.

## Data structure, provenance, and quality
- Data relationships:
  - Biota_radionuclide_data.csv comprises whole-body radionuclide concentrations for the vertebrate samples described; includes data linked to the Beresford et al. (2016) and Beresford et al. (2008) studies, with additional unreported bat data.
  - Soils data (from Beresford 2008) provide contextual environmental dose indicators (concentrations for 137Cs, Pu isotopes, and 90Sr) at the study site.
- Metadata and documentation:
  - Metadata file Biota_radionuclide_metadata.rtf available for data provenance and methodological details.
  - Documentation links to the cited literature (Beresford et al. 2008, 2016; Bondarkov et al. 2011; Gaschak et al. 2010) for broader context and prior methods.
- Data quality considerations:
  - Counting precision varies by nuclide (lower for 90Sr in some cases; higher uncertainty for Pu isotopes).
  - Site and sampling area well-described, enabling reproducibility and comparisons across studies.
  - Some data are unreported prior to this compilation, indicating potential gaps in geographic coverage or species representation.

## Access, usage, and implications for data strategy
- Data assets are tied to a history of radiological transfer studies (137Cs, Pu isotopes, 90Sr) into vertebrate wildlife within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
- The combination of published datasets with unreported bat data expands coverage across taxa and sites, offering opportunities for cross-species transfer analyses and spatial risk assessment.
- For data leaders:
  - Opportunities to enhance data discoverability and reuse by ensuring comprehensive metadata (sites, sampling dates, species, sample preparation, instrumentation, QA procedures) are consistently captured.
  - Potential to coordinate with wider data communities studying radioecology to reduce data gaps, harmonize units, and standardize metadata for easier integration.
  - Consideration of data licensing and updates to ensure ongoing accessibility and to support meta-analyses and decision-making in environmental monitoring and radiological risk assessment.
