## Overview
- Describes study design, sampling, and analytical methods for radionuclide data collected from vertebrates and soils in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone during 2005, with data prepared for deposition in the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre.
- Builds on a test application of the ERICA Tool and prior methodology from Beresford et al. (2008).

## Study design and data assets
- Three forest sites (Low, Medium, High) chosen to reflect differing anticipated soil radionuclide activity concentrations.
- 100 m × 100 m study areas marked with posts at 10 m intervals; 14 trapping occasions conducted July–August 2005.
- 100 Sherman humane traps deployed per site; traps baited with rolled oats; traps checked the following day.
- Species processed: Apodemus flavicollis (Yellow-necked mouse), Myodes glareolus (Bank vole), Microtus spp. (vole species).
- Live animals fitted with LiF-100 thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) collars; animals released at trapping point; recapture data used to reassess radiocaesium and radiostrontium body burdens.
- Data assets collected include: field locations (GPS), trap locations, animal species, live weights, whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr, TLD collar data, soil radionuclide activity, and associated metadata.

## Data collection details
- Soils: 23 samples per site, 10 cm depth; sampling area extended to 50 m beyond trapping to cover likely home ranges; soils dried and homogenised.
- Gamma-emitting radionuclides in soils measured by hyper-pure germanium detectors; spectra analysed with Genie-2000; count times chosen to achieve <20% error on 40K.
- 238,239,240 Pu in soils determined in 10 g dry-weight sub-samples using the Lx-ray method (13–23 keV) with self-absorption correction; detection limit 3–5 Bq; accuracy 10–15%.
- 90Sr in soils determined in 10 g dry-weight sub-samples via measurement of 90Y using a thin-film NaI detector; calibration per Bondarkov et al. (2002c).
- Trapping: 14 visits, 100 traps per site; collection and processing of captured small mammals; live animals fitted with TLD collars (6–36 days on animals; 85 recoveries out of 230 fitted).
- TLD data: at four randomly selected trapping points per site, additional TLDs placed at 5 cm above ground, at ground level, and 10 cm depth (paired with a Perspex-encapsulated tube in half the cases); some TLDs lost; recovered TLDs returned to supplier for analysis.
- In-lab measurements: whole-body 137Cs and 90Sr for each animal using a lead-shielded counting container; 137Cs spectra via Genie-2000; 90Sr via its daughter 90Y; count times varied 150–1200 s depending on activity.
- Recapture handling: if recaptured more than 14 days after collaring, TLD removed and animal reweighed with re-measurement; if recaptured within 14 days, location recorded and released; additional Cs measurements where available.
- Controls: seven TLDs mounted on collars transported to the Chernobyl lab remain as in-situ controls.

## Analytical methods and data processing
- 137Cs and 90Sr measurements: detectors included hyper-pure germanium and thin-film NaI scintillator; data processed with Genie-2000 software; 90Sr activity inferred from 90Y.
- Pu isotopes: Lx-ray method for 238Pu, 239Pu, 240Pu following Bondarkov et al. (2002a); corrections for self-absorption using Ba x-ray daughter; method validated with prior inter-method comparisons.
- Data processing tools and calibration: methods calibrated and validated against phantoms and radiochemical analyses as described in Bondarkov et al. (2002b–d).

## Field metadata and data provenance
- Site descriptions include soil types (soddy pseudopodzolic, podzolic-sandy, boggy soils on alluvial deposits, etc.) and dominant vegetation for Low, Medium, High sites.
- Trapping points and animal capture records linked to precise GPS locations.
- Detailed documentation of sampling depths, mass of soil analysed per sample, and the exact count times used for gamma measurements.
- References to established methods and prior datasets (ERICA metadata) for traceability and comparability.

## Data quality and validation
- Gamma measurement errors controlled to be under 20% for 40K estimates; count times chosen accordingly.
- Pu and Sr measurement methods have documented detection limits and accuracies (Pu: 10–15%; Sr: calibration against reference methods).
- TLD data include recovery rates (85 of 230 collars recovered) and documentation of loss and handling procedures; multiple positions for TLD placement increase spatial resolution of environmental dose assessment.

## Data governance, accessibility, and reuse
- Data prepared for submission to the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre, enabling discoverability and reuse.
- Methods are well-documented and alignment with ERICA framework and prior publications (Beresford et al. 2008) support integration with broader environmental radiation data and exposure modelling.

## Practical implications and considerations for Data Leaders
- The study exemplifies end-to-end data lifecycle: planning across sites, field data collection, laboratory analyses, and provenance documentation suitable for long-term data stewardship.
- Highlights the importance of interoperable metadata, cross-method calibration, and clear data lineage to enable reuse in exposure assessment and cross-study comparisons.
- Demonstrates managing complex, multi-isotope datasets across spatially distributed sites, with attention to data quality, metadata richness, and handling of incomplete field data (e.g., missing TLD recoveries).
- Provides a model for making specialized radiological data FAIR and discoverable via a national data centre, supporting broader community use and cross-referencing with established risk assessment tools.
