## Overview
- Seven-year sampling period (2000–2007) focusing on radionuclide activity in vertebrates from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ).
- Target species: Lacerta agilis (sand lizard) and Natrix natrix (grass snake).
- Two sampling sites at Red Forest near the CEZ plant, with distinct site shapes and areas.
- Measured whole-body content of radionuclides: 137Cs and 90Sr in reptiles; also 238Pu and 239,240Pu in reptiles.
- Soil samples (0–10 cm) collected for context and comparison of environmental radioactivity.

## Study design and sites
- Sites: Red Forest 1 (approx. 2.6 km SW of Chernobyl plant) and Red Forest 2 (approx. 2.7 km SW; smaller area).
- Site shapes: Red Forest 1 ~0.15 km²; Red Forest 2 ~0.01 km².
- Coordinates provided for both sites:
  - Red Forest 1: E 30.06188, N 51.38427
  - Red Forest 2: E 30.06405, N 51.38095
- Sampling period and effort:
  - L. agilis: 20 individuals captured over the study period.
  - N. natrix: 5 individuals captured over the study period.
- Capture methods:
  - L. agilis captured with Sherman traps.
  - N. natrix captured by hand.
  
## Specimens and handling
- Reptiles stored frozen until analysis.
- Pre-analytic processing:
  - Gastrointestinal tracts removed; remaining carcasses washed.
- Tissue processing and homogenisation conducted prior to radiometric analyses.

## Laboratory analysis and radionuclide measurements
- 137Cs and 90Sr (via 90Y) in reptiles:
  - Whole-body content measured using detectors: hyperpure germanium detector for 137Cs; thin-film NaI scintillation detector for 90Sr (via its daughter 90Y).
  - Spectra analysed with Canberra Genie 2000 software to determine 137Cs activity; 90Sr activity inferred from 90Y.
- Plutonium isotopes in reptiles (238Pu, 239,240Pu):
  - Radiochemical separation workflow:
    - Samples dissolved in 65% HNO3.
    - 242Pu added as a yield tracer.
    - Anion exchange separation (Bio Rad AG 1×8, 100–200 mesh) followed by co-precipitation.
    - Activity counted with a planar ion-implanted silicon detector.
- Soil samples (0–10 cm):
  - Analyzed by Canberra hyper-pure germanium detectors; spectra processed with Genie 2000 to determine 137Cs.
  - 90Sr in soils determined via measurement of 90Y activity using a thin-film NaI detector (as described by Bondarkov et al.).
  - Pu activity in soils determined using Lx-radiation (1323 keV) from Pu decay products after alpha decay, with absorption correction using Ba K-edge X-ray references.

## Data collection details and quality considerations
- Soil sampling reported as:
  - Red Forest 1: 345 soil cores collected in June 2001 (Bondarkov et al., 2003).
  - Red Forest 2: four soil cores collected in May 2007.
- Measurement quality:
  - Counting times chosen to achieve less than 20% error for 40K estimates in soils.
- Software and references:
  - Genie 2000 software used for spectral analysis.
  - Methodology and validation referenced from Bondarkov et al. (various 2002–2003 sources) for Pu and Sr analyses.
  - Related reptile radionuclide activity concentrations documented in Barnett et al. (2009).
