- Purpose and scope
  - Provides metadata for radionuclide data on vertebrates (reptiles) and associated samples from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, 2018.
  - Data stored in CEZ_reptile_data.csv with column explanations and units; cross-referenced by methods document.

- Data content and key fields
  - Chornobyl_Center_sample_code: sample identifier from the Chornobyl Center
  - Sample: sample type (lizard or soil)
  - Biota_latin_name: Latin name of the biota (species)
  - Depth_of_soil_layer_collected_cm: soil depth for 0–10 cm layer (cm)
  - Location: 'Red Forest' site 1 or site 2
  - Date_snake_or_lizard_or_soil_sampled: sampling date (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - Sex_of_snake_or_lizard: sex of the biota
  - Lizard_or_snake_total_length_mm; Lizard_tail_length_mm; Lizard_body_length_mm: body measurements (mm)
  - Fresh_mass_of_snake_or_lizard_grams; Fresh_mass_of_snake_or_lizard_carcass_grams: fresh mass and carcass mass (g)
  - Notes: gut removal before analysis
  - Cs-137_Bqkg_FM; Cs-137_error_Bqkg_FM: Cs-137 activity concentration in biota (fresh mass) and its error (Bq/kg)
  - Sr-90_Bqkg_FM; Sr-90_error_Bqkg_FM: Sr-90 activity concentration in biota (fresh mass) and its error (Bq/kg)
  - Pu-239,240_Bqkg_FM; Pu-239,240_error_Bqkg_FM: Pu-239,240 activity concentration in biota (fresh mass) and its error (Bq/kg)
  - Pu-238_Bqkg_FM; Pu-238_error_Bqkg_FM: Pu-238 activity concentration in biota (fresh mass) and its error (Bq/kg)
  - Soil_Cs-137_Bqkg_DM; Soil_Cs-137_error_Bqkg_DM: Cs-137 activity concentration in soil (dry mass) and its error (Bq/kg)
  - Notes on units: some fields specify "not applicable" for certain unit descriptions

- Measurements and units
  - Biota radionuclide concentrations: Bq/kg (fresh mass)
  - Soil radionuclide concentrations: Bq/kg (dry mass)
  - Depth: centimeters
  - Dates: day/month/year format (dd/mm/yyyy)

- Data provenance and methods
  - Metadata references a broader dataset and companion methods document: Materials_and_methods_CEZ_reptile.rtf
  - Primary context and methodology described in Barnett et al. 2009 for reptile radionuclide activity in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone

- Data management and accessibility
  - Data curated and archived by the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre
  - Standardised column headings and units to support data sharing, reuse, and cross-study comparison
  - Dataset is designed to be pluggable with other datasets to enhance environmental monitoring analyses
