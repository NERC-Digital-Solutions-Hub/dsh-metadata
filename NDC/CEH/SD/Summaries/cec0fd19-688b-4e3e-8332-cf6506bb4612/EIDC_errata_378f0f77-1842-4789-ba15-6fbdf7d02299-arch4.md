# United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: site indices data 2015

## Summary
- The dataset contains data quality issues identified in the 2015 UKBMS site indices data.
- Specifically, missing data for Polyommatus belargus (Adonis Blue) and corrupted data for Polyommatus icarus (Common Blue) not shown under the correct species name.
- A corrected Version 2 dataset has been created and supersedes the original dataset.

## Details of Issues
- Polyommatus bellargus, Adonis Blue – data were missing.
- Polyommatus icarus, Common Blue – data were corrupted and not shown under the correct species name.

## Resolution
- Version 2 of United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) site indices data 2015 has been created and supersedes this dataset.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Highlights importance of data quality control, versioning, and clear metadata.
- Demonstrates the need to replace flawed datasets with corrected versions and to communicate supersession to users.
- Underlines the value of robust data governance to ensure data are discoverable, correctly labeled by species, and reliable for research and policy use.

## Next Steps / Recommendations
- Adopt and reference the Version 2 dataset for any analyses or dissemination.
- Update documentation and user communications to reflect the supersession.
- Verify there are no additional issues and monitor for future data quality problems.
