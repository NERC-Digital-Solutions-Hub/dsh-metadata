# United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: site indices data 2015

## Overview
- The dataset reported errors: missing data for Polyommatus bellargus and Adonis Blue; data for Polyommatus icarus and Common Blue were corrupted and not shown under the correct species name.
- Version 2 of the UKBMS site indices data for 2015 has been created and supersedes the original dataset.
- The new dataset is titled: United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: site indices data 2015 version 2.

## GIS implications
- For map-based data products, use the version 2 dataset to ensure accurate species attribution and complete data.
- Revisit any prior analyses or visualisations that used the original 2015 dataset; reprocess to incorporate corrected data.
- Update metadata to reflect the correction and the supersession of the previous version; ensure consistent data standards and provenance.

## Data quality considerations
- Issues identified: missing values in two species records; misattributed/corrupted records for two other species.
- Version 2 addresses these errors; implement ongoing quality checks to prevent similar issues.

## Next steps for users
- Replace references to the 2015 dataset with the 2015 version 2 data in all GIS projects.
- Verify species alignment and data completeness in current maps and analyses.
- Consult the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre entry for access to the corrected dataset and metadata.
