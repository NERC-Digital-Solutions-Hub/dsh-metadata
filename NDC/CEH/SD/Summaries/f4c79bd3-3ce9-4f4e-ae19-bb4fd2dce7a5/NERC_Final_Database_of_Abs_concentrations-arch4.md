# Brief description of the dataset

- Weekly concentrations of fluoroquinolones and the quinolone resistance gene qnrS in the South West UK.
- Analytes include multiple fluoroquinolones (e.g., ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin-related forms, and others) and the qnrS resistance gene.
- Units are ng/L; data cover influent and effluent wastewater, plus river water upstream and downstream of the effluent discharge point.
- Study scope: 7 consecutive days (Wednesday to Tuesday) in 2015, across five major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) within a ~2,000 km2 catchment, serving ~1.5 million people (>75% of catchment population).

- Study design and sampling
  - Samples collected: WWTP influent and effluent, river water upstream and downstream of discharge points (site E excluded due to estuary discharge).
  - Influent sampling: 24 h volume-proportional composites with ~15-minute subsamples using an ISCO 3700 autosampler; sub-samples cooled during collection.
  - Effluent sampling: time-proportional composites due to limited variation.
  - River water: 8 L grab samples; all samples transported on ice for processing.
  - Processing: all samples weighed, filtered, and stored appropriately until analysis.

- Analytical workflow
  - Targeted analysis using chiral liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
  - Sample preparation: filtration through GF/F, spiking with isotopically labeled internal standards, SPE on Oasis HLB cartridges, elution with methanol, evaporation, reconstitution in ammonium formate/methanol with formic acid.
  - Instrumentation: Waters ACQUITY UPLC with CHIRALCEL OZ-RH chiral column; isocratic mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium formate/methanol (1:99) with 0.05% formic acid; flow 0.1 mL/min.
  - MS detection: triple quadrupole (Xevo TQD) in positive mode; data processed with TargetLynx.
  - Quality control: analyses run in duplicates; internal standards used to ensure accuracy; method fully validated (Castrignano et al. 2018).

- Data content and format
  - Reported concentrations for quinolones and quinolone resistance determinants in influent, effluent, and river samples during the monitoring week.
  - Format: ng/L.
  - Abbreviations used in documentation include n.d. (not detected), <MQL (below method quantification limit), and standard wastewater/river sampling terminology (influent, effluent, river upstream, river downstream).

- Data governance and references
  - The analytical method and validation are documented in Castrignano et al. 2018; further related studies include Kasprzyk-Hordern et al. 2020 and Petrie et al. 2016.

- Note for data levers
  - The dataset supports assessing environmental exposure to fluoroquinolones and associated resistance determinants across a WWTP-to-river system.
  - It emphasizes a robust sampling design (composites vs grabs), rigorous sample preparation, and a validated, reproducible chiral LC-MS/MS method to enable cross-study comparability and data integration within wider data ecosystems.
