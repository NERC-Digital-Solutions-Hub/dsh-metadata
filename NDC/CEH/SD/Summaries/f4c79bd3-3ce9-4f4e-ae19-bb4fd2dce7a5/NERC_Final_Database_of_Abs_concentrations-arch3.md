# Brief description of the dataset

- Weekly concentrations of fluoroquinolones and the resistance qnrS gene in the South West UK.
- Analytes include a broad set of fluoroquinolones and their derivatives: (±)-ofloxacin, (±)ofloxacinN-oxide, (±)-desmethyl-ofloxacin, (±)-lomefloxacin, (±)-moxifloxacin, S,S-moxifloxacinN-sulfate, R -(+)-besifloxacin, (±)-prulifloxacin, (±)-ulifloxacin, (±)-flumequine, (±)-nadifloxacin; ciprofloxacin, desethylene-ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and nalidixic acid.
- Data format: concentrations in ng/L for influent and effluent wastewater, and for the receiving river water during the monitoring week.
- References provided for methods and context.

## Study design and scope

- Location: five major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) contributing to one river catchment in South-West UK.
- Area and population: ~2,000 km2 catchment; ~1.5 million people (over 75% of the catchment population).
- Monitoring period: 7 consecutive days between June and October 2015.
- Matrices sampled: wastewater influent, wastewater effluent, river water upstream and downstream of the effluent discharge point (Site E excluded due to direct estuary discharge).
- Sampling coverage: influent samples collected as 24 h flow-proportional composites; effluent samples collected with time-proportional sampling; river water collected as 8 L grab samples.

## Sampling and handling details

- Influent: 24 h composite samples with average sub-sample intervals of ~15 minutes using an ISCO 3700 autosampler; subsamples cooled to 4°C during collection; samples pooled after 24 h.
- Effluent: time-proportional sampling to reflect limited variation.
- River water: grab samples collected upstream and downstream at varying distances for accessibility; all samples transported on ice for processing.

## Sample preparation and analytical method

- Prep: filtration through GF/F 0.7 μm filters; spiked with isotopically-labeled internal standards (1 mg/L).
- Extraction: solid-phase extraction using Oasis HLB cartridges; conditioning and washing steps; elution with methanol; evaporation under nitrogen; reconstitution in 0.5 mL of 10 mM ammonium formate/methanol 1:99 with 0.05% formic acid.
- Instrumentation: chiral UPLC-MS/MS system (Waters ACQUITY) with a CHIRALCEL OZ-RH column; positive electrospray ionisation.
- Mobile phase: 10 mM ammonium formate/methanol 1:99 v/v with 0.05% formic acid; flow 0.1 mL/min; isocratic.
- Data handling: analyses performed in duplicate; data processed with TargetLynx software.
- Quality assurance: fully validated method (Castrignano et al. 2018).

## Data format and scope

- Output: concentrations of quinolones in ng/L for influent, effluent, and river water during the monitoring week.
- Data use-ready format intended for monitoring frameworks, with clear reporting of methodology and QA/QC.
