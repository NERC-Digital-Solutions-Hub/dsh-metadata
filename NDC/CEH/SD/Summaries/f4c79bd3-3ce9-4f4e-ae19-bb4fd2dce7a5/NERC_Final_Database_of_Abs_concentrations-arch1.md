# Brief description of the dataset

## Overview
- Weekly concentrations of fluoroquinolones and the qnrS resistance gene in the South West UK.
- Analytes include multiple fluoroquinolones (e.g., ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin variants, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid) and related compounds.
- Concentrations are reported in ng/L for influent and effluent wastewater and for receiving river water.

## Abbreviations
- n.d. = not detected
- <MQL = below method quantification limit
- Conc. = concentration
- Influent = wastewater influent
- Effluent = wastewater effluent
- River upstream = river water before treated wastewater discharge point
- River downstream = river water after treated wastewater discharge point

## Monitoring and study design
- Location: five major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) contributing to one river catchment; area ~2,000 km2; population ~1.5 million (>75% of catchment population).
- Period: 7 consecutive days (Wednesday to Tuesday) between June and October 2015.
- Sampling points:
  - Influent wastewater (collected between screening and primary sedimentation)
  - Effluent wastewater
  - River water upstream and downstream of the discharge point (distance varies by site)
  - Site E excluded (WWTP discharges directly to estuary)
- Sampling methods:
  - Influent: volume-proportional 24 h composites; ~15-minute subsamples
  - Effluent: time-proportional composites
  - River water: grab samples (8 L)
- Handling: all samples transported on ice to the laboratory

## Analytical method
- Preparation: filtration (GF/F 0.7 μm), spiking with isotopically-labelled internal standards, SPE (Oasis HLB cartridges), elution with methanol, evaporation to dryness, reconstitution (0.5 mL of 10 mM ammonium formate/methanol 1:99 with 0.05% formic acid), filtration (0.2 μm).
- Instrumentation: Waters ACQUITY UPLC system with CHIRALCEL OZ-RH chiral column; 30°C column, 4°C autosampler; mobile phase 10 mM ammonium formate/methanol 1:99 with 0.05% formic acid; flow 0.1 mL/min; isocratic.
- Detection: MS/MS (Xevo TQD triple quadrupole) in positive mode; specific MS parameters (capillary ~3 kV, temperatures, gas flows) described; data processed with TargetLynx.
- Analysis: samples prepared and analyzed in duplicate.
- Validation: method fully validated as described in Castrignano et al. 2018.

## Data format
- Concentrations expressed in ng/L for influent, effluent, and receiving environment during the monitoring week.

## Quality, validation, and references
- Method validation described in Castrignano et al. 2018 (Chemosphere) and related works.
- Related datasets and context documented in Castrignano et al. 2020 (Water Research) and Petrie et al. 2016 (J Chromatogr A).
