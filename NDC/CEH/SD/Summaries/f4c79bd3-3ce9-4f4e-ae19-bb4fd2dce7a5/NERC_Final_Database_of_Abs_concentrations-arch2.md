# Brief description of the dataset

- Weekly concentrations of fluoroquinolones and the resistance gene qnrS measured in wastewater and river water in the South West UK.
- Analytes include multiple fluoroquinolones and related compounds: (±)-ofloxacin, (±)ofloxacinN-oxide, (±)-desmethyl-ofloxacin, (±)-lomefloxacin, (±)-moxifloxacin, S,S-moxifloxacinN-sulfate, R-(+)-besifloxacin, (±)-prulifloxacin, (±)-ulifloxacin, (±)-flumequine, (±)-nadifloxacin; ciprofloxacin, desethylene-ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid.
- Data format: concentrations in ng/L for influent, effluent, river upstream, and river downstream during a monitoring week.

## Overview and purpose

- Demonstrates environmental condition and potential policy implications by providing standardized, comparable measurements over time.
- Aligns with monitoring responsibilities of environmental agencies to assess health of water systems and treatment performance.

## Study area and sampling design

- Location: five major wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) contributing to a single river catchment in South-West UK; area about 2,000 km2; population ~1.5 million (over 75% of catchment population).
- Timeframe: seven consecutive days of sampling, Wednesday to Tuesday, between June and October 2015.
- Sample points:
  - Wastewater influent (24 h composites) collected during screening to primary sedimentation.
  - Wastewater effluent (time-proportional sampling).
  - River water collected upstream and downstream of the effluent discharge point (grab samples; 8 L each). Site E excluded due to estuary discharge.
- Sampling frequency and handling: influent subsamples ~15 minutes; all samples kept on ice and transported to the lab.

## Sample preparation and analysis

- Analyte processing: samples filtered, spiked with isotopically labeled internal standards, extracted with SPE (Oasis HLB cartridges), eluted with methanol, evaporated, reconstituted, and filtered before analysis.
- Instrumental analysis: chiral liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a chiral CHIRALCEL OZ-RH column; positive ion mode; isocratic mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium formate/methanol 1:99 with 0.05% formic acid.
- Quantification: 20 µL injections on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC system with Xevo TQD MS; data processed with TargetLynx.
- Quality assurance: samples prepared and analysed in duplicate; method fully validated per referenced validation study.

## Data format and output

- Concentrations reported as ng/L for influent, effluent, and river water (upstream and downstream) during the monitoring week.
- Abbreviations used in the dataset (e.g., n.d. not detected; <MQL below method quantification limit).

## Analytical method context and validation

- method based on enantioselective fractionation of fluoroquinolones; validated in Castrignano et al. 2018 and related works; robust for environmental matrices.
- Supporting references detail river catchment perspectives, multi-residue analysis, and analytical methodology.

## Relevance for monitoring and policy

- Provides standardized data to track wastewater treatment performance, environmental exposure in receiving waters, and potential shifts in antibiotic resistance gene prevalence.
- Data can be integrated with other datasets to enhance environmental health monitoring, support regulatory decisions, and enable data sharing across portals.
