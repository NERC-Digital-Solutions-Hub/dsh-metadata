# pasture fed livestock farms across Great Britain, 2019

- Background and Objective
  - UK grasslands are highly significant for farmers and the public; grassland soils filter water, cycle nutrients, store carbon, and support biodiversity.
  - The Pasture Fed Livestock Association (PFLA) certification standards address environmental and animal health concerns, with evidence suggesting benefits of diverse swards for biodiversity, animal health, soil health, and resilience.
  - The study aims to evidence the impacts of pasture-fed livestock approaches (primarily mob grazing, with some emphasis on herbal leys) on grassland ecology, including sward composition and soil qualities, across Great Britain.

- Study Design and Sampling
  - 17 farms across Britain, members of PFLA, recruited in 2019.
  - Field sampling occurred May–September 2019.
  - Paired-field design where possible: mob-grazed field vs. comparable field with set-stocking; comparisons also included fields under species-rich leys versus traditional leys.
  - Field pairs were sampled as 2x2 m plots with a W-shaped transect for soils; multiple fields per farm in some cases.
  - Farms anonymised with IDs to protect landowner confidentiality.

- Data Collected and Measurements
  - Vegetation
    - Three randomly placed 2x2 m quadrats per field; recorded species, species cover (%), flowering status, vegetation height, wormcasts, soil condition, and biomass in a subsample.
    - Detailed plot attributes captured (survey dates, slope, aspect, shade, canopy/shrub/ground heights).
  - Biomass
    - Dried plant material weighed and classified into grass, dicot, and cereal groups; total biomass recorded.
  - Soils and Soil Chemistry
    - For each field: soil cores (15 cm depth, 5 cm diameter) and bulked samples across three depths (0–5 cm, 5–15 cm, 15–30 cm) along a W transect.
    - Measured properties include: bulk density, carbon, total nitrogen, pH (in water and CaCl2), Olsen P and total P, aggregate stability, texture, loss-on-ignition (LOI), CaCO3, electrical conductivity (EC), soil moisture, and bulk densities for fine earth.
    - Particle size distribution analyzed by laser diffraction and hydrometer methods; QA with standards and duplicate checks.
    - Soil DNA (eDNA) sub-samples submitted to European Nucleotide Archive (PRJEB46195).
  - Farm Management and Field Management
    - Farmer interviews and on-site questionnaires captured current and historic field management, grazing management (stocking type and density, longevity), sward longevity, and inputs.
    - Field- and farm-level management data include area under mob grazing, set stocking, rest periods, shade, fertiliser and manure use, silage practices, and field rest.
  - Stock and Supplemental Feeding
    - Information on supplemental feeding practices, bales rolling, and livestock types (cattle beef/dairy, sheep, pigs, goats, horses).
  - Data for Field and Farm Characteristics
    - Field sizes, sub-unit structure, shade presence, and other habitat/land classification attributes recorded for each field.
  - Data Access and Tables
    - Seven CSV data tables aggregating the dataset:
      - SEEGSLIP_PLOTS_2019.csv (vegetation plot-level data)
      - SEEGSLIP_SPECIES_2019.csv (species-level vegetation data)
      - SEEGSLIP_BIOMASS_2019.csv (dried biomass by group)
      - SEEGSLIP_SOIL_2019.csv (soil chemistry and physical properties)
      - SEEGSLIP_FARMDATA_2019.csv (farm-level management information)
      - SEEGSLIP_FIELDS_2019.csv (field- and sub-field management attributes)
      - SEEGSLIP_STOCK_2019.csv (stocking information)
    - Farms anonymised with numeric IDs; data include plant species nomenclature (BRC codes) and land classification references.

- Data Structure and Quality Assurance
  - eDNA data deposited with the European Nucleotide Archive (primary accession PRJEB46195).
  - Laboratory analyses followed established UK CEH and CS methodology:
    - LOI and SOC/N analyses with quality control standards.
    - P and Olsen P measurement with calibration and QA references.
    - pH, EC, bulk density, and moisture measurements with internal standards and replicate checks.
    - PSD analysis with calibration standards and cross-validation against sand weights.
  - Data tables include detailed field and plot metadata enabling robust cross-field comparisons while maintaining anonymity.

- Data Governance and Access
  - Data are structured for comparative monitoring across GB farms and fields.
  - Anonymisation of farms via ID numbers; underlying data sharing is balanced with confidentiality considerations.
  - Comprehensive metadata and methodological documentation accompanying the dataset to enable reuse in monitoring and evaluation.

- Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
  - Provides a rich, standardised set of environmental indicators across multiple scales (plot, field, farm) relevant to monitoring frameworks evaluating pasture-based farming systems.
  - Measures cover: vegetation composition and diversity, ground cover and biomass, soil organic matter and nutrients (SOC, N, P, Olsen P), soil health indicators (pH, EC, bulk density, PSD, aggregate stability), and physical habitat attributes.
  - Enables evaluation of management practices (mob grazing vs set stocking; species-rich vs traditional leys; field rest; silage and fertiliser use) on grassland ecology and soil health.
  - Data can inform policy decisions and future monitoring designs by highlighting relationships between management practices and environmental health outcomes, while addressing governance and data quality considerations central to monitoring frameworks.
