# pasture fed livestock farms across Great Britain, 2019

## Aim
- Provide a consistent, time-stamped data set to evidence the effects of pasture-fed livestock practices on grassland parameters and soil qualities.
- Support environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation across Great Britain by enabling cross-site comparisons and trend analyses.

## What was studied
- Grasslands used for pasture-fed livestock across Great Britain, focusing on sward composition and soil quality.
- Emphasis on the Pasture Fed Livestock Association (PFLA) certification standards and practices, including mob grazing and herbal leys.
- Contextualises grassland habitats and their ecosystem services (carbon storage, water filtration, biodiversity).

## Study design
- 17 farms, all members of PFLA (10 fully certified, 7 with intent to certify).
- Sampling year: 2019 (second year of sampling), between May and September.
- Field comparisons aimed to contrast: 
  - mob grazing vs set-stocking, or
  - species-rich ley vs traditional ley.
- Farms anonymised; multiple fields per farm sampled as pairs where possible.

## Data collected and methods
- Vegetation
  - Field surveys in 2 x 2 m plots; three randomly placed quadrats per field.
  - Data collected: plant species, percent cover, flowering status, vegetation height, wormcasts, soil surface condition, and above-ground biomass (sub-sample).
  - W-shaped transect across fields used to sample soils and vegetation across depths.

- Biomass
  - Dried plant material separated into groups (grass, dicot, cereal), weighed after drying.

- Soils
  - Soil cores (15 cm depth, 5 cm diameter) and multiple augered samples across fields.
  - Analyses aligned with CS soil protocols, including:
    - Loss-on-ignition (LOI) for organic matter estimation.
    - Total soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) via elemental analysis.
    - Total and Olsen phosphorus (P) with colourimetric assays.
    - pH (in water and CaCl2), electrical conductivity (EC), soil moisture, bulk density, stone content.
    - Particle size distribution (laser diffraction and hydrometer method).
    - Aggregate stability and calcium carbonate content.
    - Soil eDNA data from subsamples (deposited in European Nucleotide Archive; accession PRJEB46195).

- Farm management and field data
  - On-site farmer interviews and a dedicated questionnaire capturing sward longevity, stocking types/density, rest periods, inputs, fertiliser/manure use, and other management practices.
  - Field- and farm-level management details recorded, including grazing type, rest periods, shade, field size, and sub-field variations.

- Stock and field details
  - Data on farm stock types (e.g., cattle, sheep, etc.) and supplementary feeding practices.

## Data structure and access
- Seven CSV data tables (anonymised farm identifiers):
  - SEEGSLIP_PLOTS_2019.csv (vegetation plots)
  - SEEGSLIP_SPECIES_2019.csv (species-level vegetation data)
  - SEEGSLIP_BIOMASS_2019.csv (dried biomass by group)
  - SEEGSLIP_SOIL_2019.csv (soil chemistry and physical properties)
  - SEEGSLIP_FARMDATA_2019.csv (farm-level management data)
  - SEEGSLIP_FIELDS_2019.csv (field-level management and characteristics)
  - SEEGSLIP_STOCK_2019.csv (stocking information)
- Farms are anonymised with IDs; fields recorded per plot and per field.
- An integrated data set supports cross-field and cross-farm comparisons.

## Quality assurance and data standards
- Rigorous QA procedures across analyses (e.g., LOI QC with internal standards; duplicate analyses; calibration checks; blanks).
- Standard UKCEH/CS methodologies followed for soil analyses and measurements.
- Data deposited for eDNA sequencing with primary accession PRJEB46195.

## Anonymisation and data access
- Farm and field data anonymised to protect landowner confidentiality.
- eDNA data stored in the European Nucleotide Archive; dataset linkages documented within the data tables.

## Use for environmental monitoring and policy
- Provides a standardized GB-wide dataset to monitor grassland ecosystems under different management regimes.
- Enables assessment of ecosystem services (soil carbon, biodiversity proxies, nutrient cycling) under mob grazing versus conventional grazing.
- Facilitates integration with other environmental datasets (e.g., land classification, soil health indicators) to inform policy performance and environmental health monitoring.

## Opportunities and challenges for analysts
- Value through data integration: combine SEEGSLIP data with other environmental datasets to enhance monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Data accessibility: ensure broad access to underlying datasets while maintaining confidentiality; potential for portal-based dissemination and harmonization with similar datasets.
