# STAR Survey Dataset - ReadMe file

## Overview
- The STAR Survey dataset comprises three files intended to document interviews with farmers in the Ping Catchment, Thailand as part of the STAR project.
- Interviews were conducted in January 2020.
- The dataset is suitable for GIS-based analysis when combined with spatial context or other geographic datasets.

## Dataset contents
- STAR_Survey_Dataset.csv: 176 interview records from farmers in the Ping Catchment, collected January 2020.
- STAR_Survey_Questionnaire.docx: The questionnaire used for the survey.
- STAR_Survey_SupportingInformation.docx: Documentation describing the research context, data collection methods, and guidance on using the data.

## How to use for GIS
- Use the CSV records to analyze geographic-patterns of interview responses when linked with spatial layers (e.g., land use, farm types, watershed boundaries).
- Check the supporting information for details on data collection and any location-related metadata to determine how to georeference or relate interview data to spatial units.
- Review the questionnaire to understand variable meanings and ensure correct interpretation of attributes during mapping and analysis.

## Data notes and considerations
- Timeframe is fixed to January 2020; temporal context should be considered in analyses.
- The presence of any geolocation or farm-level coordinates is not specified—refer to the supporting information to determine whether location data are included or how to link responses to spatial data.
- Data quality, consistency, and any limitations are described in the supporting information; data cleaning and harmonization may be required for GIS workflows.
