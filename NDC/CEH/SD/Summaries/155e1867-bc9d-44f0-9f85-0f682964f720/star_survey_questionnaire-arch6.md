# Questionnaire form

## Overview
- A comprehensive household farming survey focused on drought experiences, adaptation, and information flows.
- Collects demographic, farm characteristics, assets, income, irrigation, and technology access.
- Aims to inform drought resilience efforts (STAR) and data-driven support for farmers.

## Section 1: Background information and farming activities
- Respondent demographics: age group, education level.
- Farm type: crop/animal emphasis (rice, maize, vegetables, fruits, livestock, poultry, aquaculture, etc.).
- Household farm scale: land area, number of large animals, poultry, and irrigation details.
- Land tenure: percent rented vs owned; years farming; family members and dependents involved; paid laborers.
- Water and irrigation: sources (river, canal, well, tubewell, etc.); water allocation (private vs community); irrigation methods (flooding, surface, spray, drip, etc.) and their area coverage.
- Market destinations: subsistence, local/national/export markets.
- Household assets and connectivity: ownership counts (tractor, pond, tanks, wells, pumps, laptop, TV, radio, bicycles, motorcycles, cars/trucks); Wi-Fi, mobile phones, smartphones; electricity access.
- Farm growth comparison (last 10 years) and self-assessed change in cropped area, animals, crop/animal variety, and non-agricultural income sources.
- Household capacity indicators: number of workers, income bands (THB), and other income sources.
- Additional outputs: notes on potential data quality and areas for data enhancement.

## Section 2: Drought experiences and perceptions
- Definitions: respondent understanding of drought.
- Drought frequency: number of droughts in the past 10 years and years recalled.
- Impacts by drought: crop quality/yield, pests/disease, feed availability, livestock/poultry, animal welfare, farmer income, input costs, sales prices, farmer wellbeing, and other impacts.
- Positive outcomes: any beneficial effects from drought.
- Perceptions and expectations: agreement with statements on future drought vulnerability, information sufficiency, potential severity, and whether impacts are worsening.

## Section 3: Drought adaptation strategies
- Catalog of adaptation measures (e.g., boreholes, ponds, dams, microdams, water tanks, water purchases, other).
- Effectiveness: for each measure, whether it reduced drought impacts (yes/no).
- Agricultural adjustments if adopted: shifting to drought-tolerant crops, changing cultivation periods, crop varieties, wetting-drying techniques, irrigation dose adjustments, drip irrigation, selective irrigation, night irrigation, shifting to alternative livelihoods (e.g., shrimp farming), etc.
- Prioritization of crops if drought measures were adopted: drought-tolerant vs high-value crops, others.
- Soil and forage management: soil condition measures historically used during droughts.
- Animal management and feed: changes to animal management (selling/culling/grazing patterns, breeding herd, feed management).
- Income diversification: measures such as purchasing/selling feed, changing feed composition, creating a feed management plan, other strategies.
- Barriers to adoption: reasons for not implementing desired adaptations; additional future changes or strategies not yet tried.

## Section 4: Compensation and support
- Availability and receipt: whether financial compensation exists in the area and whether the household has received it.
- Types of support: other forms of assistance (seeds, debt relief, etc.).

## Section 5: Drought warning and adaptation advice
- Information about drought warnings: whether they were informed a drought was coming; what information was received.
- Guidance received: what to do under drought (advice content).
- Behavioral response: whether actions changed as a result of the information; details of changes if any; reasons if no changes.
- Information sharing with others: whether the household informed others or was informed by other farmers; number of individuals involved.
- Informing organizations: organizations providing drought alerts and guidance; whether the organization provided drought monitoring information (forecast, river discharge, groundwater, reservoir levels, soil moisture, etc.) and what advice was given.
- Communication channels: how information was delivered (face-to-face, village meetings, telephone, letters, text, radio, TV, social media, online chat groups, newspapers, government reports, etc.).
- Frequency: rough count of information communications in the past year.
- Organization-specific assessments: perceived usefulness and timeliness of information, relevance to farm activities, trust in accuracy, clarity of format, and willingness of the organization to receive farmer feedback.

## Key data points for analysis and dashboards
- Demographics and farm characteristics (age, education, farm type, land area, irrigation, income bands, assets, connectivity).
- Drought exposure metrics (number of droughts, years of occurrence, perceived severity).
- Impacts and wellbeing indicators (crop yield/quality, livestock, income, costs, prices, farmer wellbeing).
- Adaptation uptake and effectiveness (which measures adopted, perceived impact, crop/crop-practice prioritization).
- Resource and constraint factors (time, money, workload, access to irrigation and water).
- Compensation and external support (types, recipients, perceived usefulness).
- Information ecosystem (informed about drought, sources and organizations, channels, frequency, and perceived usefulness).
- Trust and usefulness ratings for information providers (organization-specific assessments).

## Potential data products and next steps
- Drought exposure and adaptation dashboards mapping farm-level data to regional drought events.
- Cross-tab analyses linking adaptation uptake to farm type, water access, and income.
- Organization performance briefs comparing information usefulness, timeliness, and channels.
- Prediction-ready variables for planning: adoption likelihood by crop type, water-saving interventions, and flood/drill-resistant practices.
- Data quality improvements: strategies to reduce recall bias and align versions of drought definitions.
