# Strengthening Thailand's Agricultural Drought Resilience (STAR) - Ping Catchment Farmers Survey Dataset

## Overview
- STAR is a 2018–2021 project funded by UKRI and TSRI, linking UK and Thai institutions to study drought characteristics, impacts on food production and farmers’ livelihoods, and to develop drought resilience through participatory approaches.
- The Ping catchment serves as a detailed case study within a national scope.
- Key focus: identify socioeconomic impacts of historical droughts, factors affecting adaptation decisions, and communications among farmers during drought.

## Data collection
- Villages in the Ping catchment with a drought history were selected to represent typical farming typologies.
- In each village, the village headperson selected farm household heads; trained enumerators collected data after informed consent.
- 176 questionnaires completed in January 2020.
- Geographic distribution: Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Kamphaeng Phet, and Tak provinces.
- Data collection oversight: enumerators trained; STAR project staff present throughout; ethical approval obtained.

## Data content and structure
- The questionnaire captured socioeconomic, agricultural, risk appraisal, adaptation appraisal, adaptation behavior, and drought communications data.
- Original questionnaire written in English, translated to Thai, then translated back to English for analysis.
- The dataset is fully anonymised with a unique identifier for each participant: identifier_id2.
- Data types:
  - Quantitative and qualitative data included; units provided in the questionnaire.
  - Columns A–M contain participant identifiers and interview location (province, village, district).
  - Columns N onward contain responses to questions; headers indicate the corresponding questionnaire item (e.g., Q1_age).
  - For multi-choice questions (e.g., Q5), responses appear in multiple columns (Q5_1 to Q5_12; note: the dataset text shows Q3_12 in one place which may be a typographical inconsistency).

## Guidance and documentation
- Use the accompanying STAR Survey Questionnaire document (Questionnaire (STAR Survey Questionnaire.docx)) as the primary guide for interpreting the dataset.
- The dataset has been anonymised to protect participant privacy and should be analyzed with attention to the identifiers and location fields.

## Ethics and governance
- Ethical approval obtained through Cranfield University Research Ethics System (CURES) CURES/9419/2019.
- Data collection conducted with informed consent and oversight to ensure data quality and integrity.

## How this supports analysis and data use
- Enables analysis of relationships between socioeconomic factors, agricultural practices, risk/adaptation appraisals, adaptation behaviors, and drought communications at the farmer level.
- Provides a structured, self-contained dataset suitable for dashboards, reports, or exploratory analyses to inform drought resilience policy and communication strategies.
- Anonymised design facilitates sharing and re-use while protecting participant privacy.
