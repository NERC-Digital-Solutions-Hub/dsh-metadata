# Strengthening Thailand's Agricultural drought Resilience (STAR)

- Purpose and scope
  - A comprehensive questionnaire designed to collect baseline and situational data on farming households to monitor drought resilience, evaluate policy impacts, and inform future decisions.
  - Aims to capture farm characteristics, drought experiences, adaptation actions, compensation/support uptake, and information flows from drought warning and adaptation guidance.

- Survey structure at a glance
  - Section 1: Background information and farming activities
    - Demographics (age, education), farm type and focus, farm size, tenure, years farming, household labor, income, irrigation, water sources, assets, connectivity (Wi‑Fi, mobile phones), electricity, and perceived changes over the past decade.
  - Section 2: Drought experiences and perceptions
    - Definition of drought, frequency over the last 10 years, observed drought impacts (crop quality/yield, pests/diseases, feed, livestock, income, input costs, prices, wellbeing), and perceived preparedness and risk.
  - Section 3: Drought adaptation strategies
    - Catalog of adaptation measures (drilling boreholes, ponds, dams, microdams, water tanks, water purchases, other); whether each measure reduced future drought impacts; if adopted, which specific crop and farming changes (crop types, timing, varieties, irrigation practices, etc.); soil/land management and biomass/animal management strategies; income diversification; prioritization of drought-tolerant vs high-value crops; constraints and reasons for non‑adoption; openness to additional measures.
  - Section 4: Compensation and support
    - Availability and receipt of financial compensation; other supports (seeds, mortgage relief, etc.).
  - Section 5: Drought warning and adaptation advice
    - Information received about impending droughts; guidance on what to do during droughts; changes implemented in response; providers and channels of information; frequency of communications; evaluation of information and organizations; familiarity with and trust in information sources; cross-organization comparisons and preferred information channels.

- Key variables and data themes
  - Demographics and household/farm characteristics
    - Age, education, farm type, land area, tenure, years farming, family labor, dependents, hired labor, irrigation %, crops/animals, water sources, irrigation methods, crops’ destination (subsistence/local/national/export), assets, connectivity, electricity.
  - Exposure and vulnerability to drought
    - Definition of drought; number of drought events in 10 years; years of drought; impacts across crops, livestock, prices, and wellbeing; perceived severity and preparedness; expectations for future drought impacts.
  - Adaptation and resilience actions
    - Specific adaptation measures adopted or planned; effectiveness in reducing impacts (Y/N); crop prioritization decisions; irrigation optimization; soil moisture and groundwater recharge actions; animal and feed management; income diversification; barriers to adoption.
  - Information, warnings, and governance
    - Sources of drought warnings and guidance (government, community, NGOs, private organizations, individuals); information channels and frequency; types of information/advice received; actions taken as a result; evaluation of usefulness, timeliness, relevance, and accuracy; trust in organizations; cross-organization familiarity.
  - Compensation and support
    - Receipt of compensation or other supports; types of assistance received.

- Data governance, openness, and data-sharing considerations
  - The instrument emphasizes capturing information on information providers and channels, enabling assessment of data provenance and accessibility.
  - It includes respondent-reported data across multiple organizations, highlighting the need for clear data governance, consent, and anonymization to support data sharing while protecting privacy.
  - To align with monitoring framework best practices, consider formalizing metadata, data quality checks, and standardized variable definitions to facilitate cross-institution data integration.

- Practical considerations for monitoring framework authors
  - Use of a multi-section, household-level instrument allows tracking changes over time and across regions, supporting longitudinal resilience indicators.
  - Enables assessment of:
    - Adaptation uptake and effectiveness (e.g., boreholes, ponds, drip irrigation, crop changes).
    - Access to and impact of drought information and warnings.
    - Performance and trust of information providers and channels.
    - Economic and social impacts of drought (income, prices, wellbeing).
  - Requires careful enumerator training to ensure consistent interpretation of terms (e.g., drought definitions, impact categories, and Y/N follow-ups).
  - May require sampling design, consent processes, and data anonymization protocols to mitigate privacy concerns and reduce respondent burden.
  - Integration with other data sources (meteorological, hydrological, governance data) to triangulate self-reported information and strengthen policy relevance.

- Outputs and policy relevance
  - A rich set of indicators on exposure, vulnerability, adaptation, information flows, and governance.
  - Insights into which adaptation measures are most used and most effective, and where information channels are most trusted or effective.
  - Evidence to inform drought risk communication strategies, compensation programs, and capacity-building initiatives for farmers and extension services.
