# Questionnaire form

- Purpose and scope
  - A comprehensive questionnaire designed to collect data on farmer demographics, farm characteristics, drought experiences, adaptation strategies, compensation and support, and drought warning/advice information.
  - Aimed at informing analyses of drought resilience, information pathways, and adaptation effectiveness within farming communities (STAR project context).

- Section 1: Background information and farming activities
  - Demographics: age categories; education level; gender (recorded).
  - Farm type and production focus: detailed categorization (rice; field crops; vegetables; fruits; ornamentals; grassland; livestock; poultry; fish ponds; other) with example crops/animals.
  - Household farm size and assets: land area (rai); counts of large animals and poultry; land tenure (rented vs owned); years farming; household labor; dependents; paid labor; irrigation share; crops irrigated; water source and allocation; irrigation methods and share by method.
  - Market destinations and income: where production goes (subsistence/local/national/export); annual income band (THB); other agricultural/non-agricultural income sources.
  - Assets and connectivity: counts of assets (tractor, plough, pond, water tank, well, pump, laptop/computer, TV, radio, bikes, motorcycles, cars, trucks); Wi‑Fi; mobile phones and smartphones; electricity on farm.
  - Time trends and preparedness: self-assessment of changes over the past 10 years in cropped area, animals, crop/animal variety, non-agricultural income sources; perceived better/worse performance; preparedness to deal with drought.

- Section 2: Drought experiences and perceptions
  - Drought understanding and frequency: participants’ definition of drought; number of drought experiences in the last 10 years; years when droughts occurred.
  - Impacts across farm systems: drought impacts on crop quality/yield, pests/diseases, feed availability, livestock/poultry production, animal welfare, farmer income, input costs, sales prices, farmer wellbeing, and other impacts.
  - Outcomes and perceptions: any positive outcomes from drought.
  - Perceptions about future drought risk and information: agreement with statements on future negative effects, personal drought knowledge, and perceived severity.

- Section 3: Drought adaptation strategies
  - Catalog of adaptation measures: boreholes, ponds, dams, microdams, water tanks, water purchases, other measures; whether each measure reduced drought impacts (Y/N).
  - Adaptation pathways and prioritization: if measures were adopted, which crops were prioritized (drought-tolerant, high-value, other); changes to cropping (crop varieties, cultivation timing, wetting/drying techniques, drip irrigation, reduced irrigation, night irrigation, etc.); adoption of crop substitutions or shifts (e.g., toward drought-tolerant or high-value crops).
  - Soil and livestock/feed management: measures to improve soil moisture and aquifer recharge; animal management strategies during drought (selling/culling/grazing adjustments/maintaining breeding herd/other); feed management during drought; income diversification during drought (feed purchases/sales, feed composition changes, management plans, other).
  - Additional adaptation: extra strategies not previously covered; willingness to implement further long-term changes; barriers to implementing additional adaptations.
  - Perceived effectiveness and feasibility: respondent views on the adequacy of existing adaptation strategies; confidence and constraints (time, money, energy).

- Section 4: Compensation and support
  - Availability and receipt of financial compensation for drought losses; types of compensation received; other supports received (e.g., seeds, debt relief).
  
- Section 5: Drought warning and adaptation advice
  - Information flow: whether farmers were informed that a drought was coming; what information was received; whether action was taken as a result.
  - Peer information: whether other farmers informed the household farm about droughts and actions; how many other farmers informed.
  - Organizations and information channels: which community, government, or private organizations provided drought warnings/adaptation advice; types of information received; advised actions; communication channels used (face-to-face, village meetings, notices, phone, letters, texts, radio, online platforms, newspapers, TV, etc.); frequency of communications.
  - Perceptions of organizations: assess usefulness and timeliness of information; relevance to farming activities; confidence in accuracy; preferred formats; perceived interest in farmer experiences and feedback.
  - Familiar organizations: identification and evaluation of up to three organizations most familiar to the farmer; details on the kind of information provided, advice given, channels used, and impact on preparedness.

- Data types and structure
  - Mix of quantitative and qualitative data:
    - Quantitative: categorical age/education, farm type, land area, counts of assets/animals, irrigation shares, income bands, Likert-style agreement scales, frequency counts, and yes/no items.
    - Qualitative: open-ended definitions (e.g., drought definition, reasons for better/worse outcomes, descriptions of other adaptation strategies, explanations for not implementing certain measures, and details about information received and its impact).
  - Depth of information on information channels and organizations to map information networks and evaluate effectiveness.
  - Open fields (Other) to capture unanticipated measures, sources, or impacts.

- Analytical implications for analysts
  - Enables cross-sectional analysis of correlations between drought experiences, adaptation actions, and outcomes (economic, productive, wellbeing).
  - Facilitates evaluation of information pathways and actors shaping adaptation decisions.
  - Supports modeling of resilience factors, including asset base, water management, crop choices, and income diversification.
  - Provides a basis for regional/local comparisons (across farm types, water access, and information sources), while highlighting data gaps at local scales.

- Practical considerations and challenges
  - High level of detail and length may affect respondent burden and data completeness.
  - Heavy reliance on self-reported data; potential recall bias for drought years and past adaptations.
  - Standardization needs for units (e.g., rai conversion) and consistent coding of open-ended responses.
  - Variation in organizations and channels across communities may complicate cross-site comparisons.

- Overall purpose for analysts
  - To identify correlations, report findings, and build predictive insights about how farm characteristics, drought experiences, and information networks influence drought resilience and adaptation outcomes.
