# Research context

- STAR (Strengthening Thailand's Agricultural Drought Resilience) is a three-year project (2018–2021) funded by UKRI and TSRI, linking UK and Thai institutions to study drought characteristics, impacts on farming livelihoods, and resilience in Thailand, with detailed work in the Ping catchment.
- Goals include identifying historical drought impacts on agricultural communities, factors affecting adaptation decisions, and improving drought communications among farmers and decision-makers; aims to fill gaps in hydrometeorological and socioeconomic databases and to enhance proactive management through monitoring and tailored communications.
- A key deliverable is a dataset from a farmers survey in Ping catchment, capturing socioeconomic, agricultural, risk/adaptation appraisal and behavior, and drought communications data. The dataset supports analysis to inform resilience strategies at national and local scales.

## Data collection and governance

- Sampling: villages in Ping with drought history selected to represent typical production typologies; farm household heads were chosen by village heads, with trained enumerators conducting interviews after informed consent.
- Volume and timing: 176 questionnaires completed in January 2020; provinces included Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Kamphaeng Phet, and Tak.
- Oversight: a STAR project member was present throughout data collection; interviews reviewed for quality; data collection followed ethical guidelines.
- Instrument: structured questionnaire developed in English, translated into Thai, and back-translated into English for analysis.
- Ethics: study approved by Cranfield University Research Ethics System (CURES) as CURES/9419/2019.

## Data description and structure

- Anonymisation: dataset fully anonymised; participants given a unique identifier (identifier_id2).
- Data types: both quantitative and qualitative data were collected.
- Layout: Columns A–M contain participant identifiers and interview location (province, village, district); Columns N onward contain responses to questions; header names indicate questions (e.g., Q1_age).
- Multi-response questions: for example Q5 is represented across multiple columns (Q5_1, Q5_2, …, Q5_12) to capture multiple selectable options.
- Documentation: a guiding document exists (Questionnaire (STAR Survey Questionnaire.docx)) to aid use and interpretation of the dataset.

## Documentation, metadata, and translation notes

- Headers explicitly map to questionnaire questions, facilitating traceability between survey instrument and dataset.
- Location data include province, village, and district; units for quantitative responses are those used in the questionnaire.
- The English–Thai translation cycle (and back-translation) should be considered when interpreting responses and mapping to original questions.

## Access, reuse, and governance considerations

- Anonymised data supports responsible sharing; the accompanying questionnaire and metadata aid correct interpretation and reuse.
- To ensure usability and interoperability, users should refer to the STAR Survey Questionnaire documentation for guidance on data interpretation.
- Data users should be mindful of the study’s ethical provenance and the translation steps that influence wording and meaning of responses.

## Quality, limitations, and stewardship implications

- Quality controls include enumerator training, pre-interview review, and continuous on-site presence by STAR personnel.
- The dataset is constrained to 176 entries from a specific region and time period (Ping catchment, Jan 2020), which may limit generalizability but provides detailed local insights for drought resilience planning.
- For Data Stewards: ensure ongoing governance around this dataset by maintaining alignment with metadata, preserving documentation, managing versioning, and clarifying any future updates or expansions to include additional catchments or time periods. Maintain clear mappings between dataset columns and questionnaire items to support reuse across projects and datasets.
