# Research context

## Overview
- STAR (Strengthening Thailand's Agricultural Drought Resilience) is a 2018–2021 UKRI/TSRI-funded project involving UK and Thai institutions.
- Focuses on drought characteristics, impacts on food production and farmers’ livelihoods in Thailand, aiming to enhance drought resilience via participatory approaches.
- National scope with detailed work in the Ping catchment; highlights the need for better monitoring, warning, and stakeholder communication to enable proactive management.
- Identifies gaps in hydrometeorological and socioeconomic databases and limited drought communication between decision-makers and the public.

## Data Collection
- Sample: villages in the Ping catchment with drought history; 176 farm households surveyed.
- Selection: village heads chose farm household heads; trained enumerators conducted interviews after informed consent.
- Timeline: January 2020; data collection supervised throughout by a STAR team member.
- Ethical approval: Cranfield University Research Ethics System (CURES) CURES/9419/2019.
- Process: interviews collected as structured questionnaire data (socioeconomic, agricultural, risk/adaptation appraisal, adaptation behavior, drought communications); English original, translated to Thai, then back to English for analysis.

## Data Description and Structure
- Guidance: use the Questionnaire (STAR Survey Questionnaire.docx) for interpretation.
- Dataset: 176 anonymised entries with a unique identifier (identifier_id2); both quantitative and qualitative data.
- Data layout: Columns A–M contain participant identifiers and interview location (province, village, district); Columns N onward contain responses.
- Column headers: clearly indicate the question (e.g., Q1_age).
- For multi-choice questions (e.g., Q5), responses are distributed across multiple columns (e.g., Q5_1 to Q5_12).

## Data Governance, Quality, and Documentation
- Anonymisation: participant data fully anonymised with unique identifiers.
- Language and analysis: data were translated English→Thai→English for analysis; data quality checks performed during collection with ongoing project oversight.
- Documentation: detailed guidance available via the STAR Survey Questionnaire document to ensure correct interpretation and reuse.

## Ethics, Privacy, and Access
- Ethical approval secured; informed consent obtained from participants.
- Data are anonymised to protect respondent identity; dataset structure supports traceability of responses while maintaining confidentiality.

## Contextual Data Gaps and Opportunities for Data Leaders
- Addresses a gap in local-scale socioeconomic data linked to drought impacts and adaptation decisions.
- Highlights need for integrated datasets (hydrometeorological, socioeconomic) to support comprehensive drought resilience analytics.
- Emphasizes importance of clear metadata, standardized data structures, and accessible documentation to facilitate discovery, reuse, and collaboration across networks.

## Implications for Data Strategy and Practice
- End-to-end data lifecycle considerations:
  - Clear provenance and documentation (use of the standard questionnaire).
  - Robust anonymisation and ethical compliance.
  - Structured data with explicit metadata and naming conventions to aid discoverability.
  - Multilingual data handling and careful translation workflows for analysis.
- Encourages data sharing and coordination to avoid duplication and to support communities of practice in drought resilience research.
- Demonstrates the value of linking local survey data to broader monitoring and communication strategies to inform policy and outreach.
