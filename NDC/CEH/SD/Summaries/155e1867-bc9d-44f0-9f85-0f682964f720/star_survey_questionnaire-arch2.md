# Questionnaire form

## Purpose and scope
- Collects comprehensive household farm and drought-related data to monitor environmental health and policy performance under the STAR initiative.
- Structured to support standardized data collection, verification, quality assurance, and data sharing for environmental monitoring and resilience analysis.

## Section-by-section data overview

- Section 1: Background information and farming activities
  - Respondent demographics: age group, education level.
  - Farm type and focus (crop/animal categories) and sample crops/works from predefined lists.
  - Household farm size, livestock, poultry counts, land tenure (rented vs owned), years farming, family labor, dependents, paid labor.
  - Irrigation and water use: land area irrigated, water source (river, canal, well, tubewell, other), water allocation (private/community), irrigation methods, and area percentage by method.
  - Production flow: destination of agricultural products (subsistence/local/national/export).
  - Economic context: annual farm income band (THB) and other income sources.
  - Assets and connectivity: numbers of assets (tractor, pond, water tanks, wells, pumps, devices, vehicles), Wi-Fi, mobile phones (and smartphones), electricity.
  - Additional contextual items: perception of changes over the past 10 years in cropped area, animals, crop/animal diversity, and non-agricultural income sources.

- Section 2: Drought experiences and perceptions
  - Understanding of drought.
  - Drought history: frequency in the last 10 years and years experienced.
  - Impacts experienced (crop quality/yield, pests/diseases, feed availability, livestock, income, input costs, sale prices, farmer wellbeing, other).
  - Any positive outcomes from drought.
  - Attitudes and expectations: perceived likelihood of negative drought impact in next 5 years, self-assessed drought knowledge, perceived severity, and whether impacts are worsening.

- Section 3: Drought adaptation strategies
  - Catalogued adaptation measures (e.g., boreholes, ponds, dams, microdams, water tanks, buying water, other) and perceived effectiveness.
  - If adopted, details on measures and whether they reduced future drought impacts.
  - Adaptation choices: drought-tolerant crops, high-value crops, crop variety changes, cultivation timing adjustments, irrigation innovations (drip, reduced doses, night irrigation, etc.), shifting to alternative livelihoods (e.g., shrimp), and other measures.
  - Soil and water management practices from previous droughts (forest conservation, etc.).
  - Animal and feed management adjustments during droughts; income diversification actions.
  - Other adaptation strategies and long-term changes the farmer would like to implement (and barriers to implementation).
  - STAR-specific prompts to capture rationale and prioritization of strategies.

- Section 4: Compensation and support
  - Availability and receipt of financial compensation for drought losses.
  - Other types of support received (seeds, policy accommodations, etc.).

- Section 5: Drought warning and adaptation advice
  - Whether drought warnings were received and what information was provided.
  - Information about what to do under drought and any farm changes made as a result.
  - Whether other farmers were informed and how many.
  - Organisations providing drought information or warnings; names and types of information (weather forecasts, river discharge, groundwater, irrigation availability, reservoir levels, drought warnings, etc.).
  - Information channels used (face-to-face, village meetings, radio, TV, newspapers, online channels, government reports, etc.).
  - Frequency of contact over the past year.
  - Perceptions of the informing organisations: usefulness of information, timeliness, relevance, accuracy, accessibility format, and willingness to receive farmer feedback.
  - Ranking of the top three organisations most familiar to the respondent.

## Data quality, storage, and access considerations
- Emphasis on data verification, quality assurance, and standardized outputs (reports, maps, charts) and storage to appropriate portals.
- Encourages linking this questionnaire data with other environmental datasets to enhance dataset value and cross-analysis.
- Highlights the importance of making underlying data accessible to stakeholders beyond final outputs.

## How analysts can use the data
- Assess drought exposure and vulnerability across farm types, sizes, and water arrangements.
- Measure adoption and effectiveness of drought adaptation strategies.
- Examine links between assets, irrigation methods, and drought resilience.
- Evaluate how information channels and organisations contribute to preparedness and actions.
- Inform policy and program design for early warning, advisory services, compensation, and support mechanisms.

## Considerations for interpretation
- Self-reported data may be subject to recall bias and perception-based responses.
- Definitions (e.g., irrigation methods, drought thresholds) should be harmonised for cross-site comparability.
- Data collected across households can support spatial and temporal trend analyses when integrated with environmental datasets.
