# Strengthening Thailand's Agricultural drought Resilience (STAR)

## Overview
- A comprehensive farmer questionnaire designed to collect multi-dimensional data to understand demographics, farm characteristics, drought experiences, adaptation strategies, compensation/support, and information flows.
- Aims to inform drought resilience in Thai agriculture by mapping data sources, user needs, and the effectiveness of information and interventions.

## Data landscape captured
- Demographics and farm profile
  - Farmer age, education, gender; farm type and focus (crops/animals); farm size; tenure (rented vs owned); years farming; household labor and dependents; paid laborers.
- Farm assets and connectivity
  - Physical assets (tractors, ponds, water tanks, wells, pumps, laptops/computers, TV, radio, bicycles, motorcycles, cars, trucks); access to electricity and Wi‑Fi; number of mobile phones and smartphones.
- Irrigation and water use
  - Land area irrigated; water sources (river, canal, well, tubewell, other); water allocation governance (private vs community); irrigation methods and share by method.
- Production and markets
  - Crops/animals produced; where production goes (subsistence, local/national markets, exports); irrigation specifics by crop; input use and affordability considerations.
- Economic and social context
  - Annual farm income; other income sources (agriculture and non-agriculture); changes over 10 years in cropped area, livestock, crop variety, non-agricultural income; perceived preparedness and vulnerability to drought.
- Drought experiences and perceptions
  - Definition of drought; frequency over the last decade; observed drought impacts on crops, livestock, income, and well-being; any positive drought outcomes; beliefs about future drought risk and preparedness.
- Adaptation strategies
  - Concrete measures: boreholes, ponds, dams, microdams, water tanks, water purchases, other; assessment of effectiveness; shifts to drought-tolerant or high-value crops; soil and water management practices; crop choice and irrigation adjustments; income diversification and feed management; on/off-farm adaptations.
- Soil and ecosystem considerations
  - Measures to improve soil moisture and aquifer recharge (e.g., forest conservation/expansion, other soil conservation practices).
- Livestock and feed management
  - Adapting animal management during drought (selling/culling, grazing timing, maintaining breeding stock, other).
- Compensation and support
  - Awareness and receipt of drought compensation; other supports such as seeds, debt relief, or financial relief.
- Drought warning and advisory information
  - Whether farmers were informed a drought was coming; information received about what to do; any actions taken as a result; reasons for inaction; information shared by other farmers; organizations providing warnings and guidance.
- Information sources and channels
  - Organizations involved (up to three) and the types of information and advice provided; channels used (face-to-face, village meetings, radio, TV, social media, mobile/text, newspapers, government reports, etc.); frequency of communications; perceived usefulness and trust in information.
- Data quality and usefulness feedback
  - Perceived usefulness of information, timeliness, relevance, accuracy, accessibility format, willingness of organizations to receive farmer feedback.

## Data sources and information flows
- Primary data collection through a structured interview with a wide set of modules.
- Organizational information sources
  - Up to three organizations can inform about drought conditions and guidance; each organization’s information types, channels, frequency, and perceived usefulness are captured.
- Community and mass channels
  - Village meetings, radio, TV, social media, newspapers, mobile texts, and other channels used to disseminate drought-related information.

## Data quality, gaps, and governance considerations
- Data are self-reported and retrospective, subject to recall bias.
- Fragmented data sources across multiple organizations and channels; need for harmonized indicators and metadata to improve interoperability.
- Coverage spans biophysical, economic, social, and informational dimensions, highlighting gaps in standardized metrics and in tracking the effectiveness of information and interventions.
- Potential need for data standards, discoverability, and updating mechanisms to support long-term drought resilience planning.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Build a holistic data system that integrates farmer-reported data with multiple organizational data streams (weather, hydrology, agriculture extension, compensation programs).
- standardize key drought indicators (e.g., drought frequency, impacts by sector (crops, livestock), adaptation uptake, and outcomes) and ensure consistent metadata for discoverability and reuse.
- enhance data governance and stewardship across partners to reduce duplication, improve coordination, and support a community of practice around drought resilience.
- design feedback loops with farmers to translate data insights into actionable, user-centered products and communications; evaluate information delivery channels for timeliness and relevance.
- invest in multi-channel data dissemination that aligns with farmer access (face-to-face, village meetings, radio, mobile messaging, online platforms) to maximize reach and impact.
- use the collected data to monitor adaptation effectiveness, inform policy and program design, and identify gaps in compensation and support mechanisms.
