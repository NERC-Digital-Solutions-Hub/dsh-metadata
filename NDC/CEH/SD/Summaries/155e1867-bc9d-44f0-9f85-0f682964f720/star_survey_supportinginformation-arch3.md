# Strengthening Thailand's Agricultural Drought Resilience (STAR)

- Overview
  - A three-year project (2018–2021) funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI).
  - International collaboration: UK (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Cranfield University) and Thailand (Chulalongkorn University, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Chiang Mai University).
  - National scope with detailed work in the Ping catchment.
  - Goals: understand drought characteristics, impacts on food production and farmers’ livelihoods, and enhance drought resilience in agriculture via participatory approaches; identified gaps in hydrometeorological and socioeconomic databases and drought communications.

- Data collection
  - Villages in the Ping catchment with drought history selected to represent typical agricultural production typologies.
  - Village headperson selects farm household heads; trained enumerators collect data after informed consent.
  - 176 questionnaires completed in January 2020 across Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Kamphaeng Phet, and Tak provinces.
  - Data collection supervised by STAR project staff; ethical approval obtained (CURES/9419/2019).
  - Survey domains: socioeconomic, agricultural, risk appraisal, adaptation appraisal, adaptation behavior, and drought communications.
  - Questionnaire originally in English, translated to Thai, then back to English for analysis.

- Data description and structure
  - Guidance document: STAR Survey Questionnaire.docx for reference.
  - Dataset comprises 176 anonymised responses, each with a unique identifier (identifier_id2).
  - Mixed methods: quantitative and qualitative data.
  - Data organization: columns A–M contain participant identifiers and interview location; columns N onward contain question responses.
  - For multi-select questions (e.g., Q5), responses are stored in separate columns per option (e.g., Q5_1, Q5_2, etc.).

- Ethical and governance considerations
  - Anonymisation of all responses; individual participants identified only by anonymised IDs.
  - Ethical approval secured; translations conducted to ensure accurate analysis; data handling aligned with governance standards.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a structured, participatory approach to collecting both socioeconomic and adaptation-related data alongside communications.
  - Highlights the importance of a clear data dictionary and accompanying guidance to ensure consistency across analyses.
  - Shows integration of data governance (ethics, anonymisation) with data collection and dissemination practices.

- Challenges and data gaps highlighted for monitoring
  - Historical gaps in comprehensive hydrometeorological and socioeconomic databases in Thailand.
  - Limited attention to drought communications and timely, actionable information sharing.
  - Barriers to data use include data access, data sharing requirements, up-to-date information, insufficient metadata, and data formats requiring transformation.

- Usage notes
  - The dataset is intended to inform understanding of drought impacts and adaptation decisions at the farm-household level in the Ping catchment.
  - The questionnaire serves as a guidance tool for similar monitoring efforts.
