# Strengthening Thailand's Agricultural Drought Resilience (STAR) – Ping Catchment Farmers Survey Dataset

## Overview
- STAR is a three-year project (2018–2021) funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and Thailand Science Research and Innovation (TSRI).
- Partners: UK — Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Cranfield University; Thailand — Chulalongkorn University, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Chiang Mai University.
- National scope with detailed work in the Ping catchment, focusing on drought characteristics, impacts on food production and farmers’ livelihoods, and a participatory approach to enhance agricultural drought resilience.
- Targets the lack of comprehensive hydrometeorological and socioeconomic data and historically limited drought communications; aims to improve monitoring, warning, and stakeholder communication.
- This dataset documents the results of a farmers survey in the Ping catchment to identify socioeconomic impacts of drought, adaptation decisions, and local-scale communications.

## Data Collection
- Sampling: villages in the Ping catchment with drought history were selected to represent typical agricultural production typologies.
- Fieldwork: village headpersons selected farm household heads; trained enumerators conducted interviews after obtaining informed consent; one STAR team member was present throughout data collection.
- Coverage: 176 questionnaires completed in January 2020; provinces included Chiang Mai (n=41), Lamphun (n=45), Kamphaeng Phet (n=45), Tak (n=45).
- Questionnaire content: socioeconomic, agricultural, risk appraisal, adaptation appraisal, adaptation behavior, and drought communications data.
- Language and ethics: originally in English, translated to Thai and back-translated to English for analysis; ethical approval obtained via Cranfield University Research Ethics System (CURES) CURES/9419/2019.
- Data quality: enumerators trained; initial interviews reviewed to ensure data quality.

## Data Description
- Guidance: use the Questionnaire (STAR Survey Questionnaire.docx) for interpretation.
- Dataset composition: 176 anonymised entries with a unique identifier 'identifier_id2'.
- Data types: both quantitative and qualitative; units are as specified in the questionnaire.
- Structure: Columns A–M contain participant identifiers and interview location (province, village, district); Columns N onward contain responses.
  - Headers clearly indicate the corresponding question (e.g., Q1_age).
  - Multi-choice questions (e.g., Q5) are stored across multiple columns (Q5_1 to Q5_12, as applicable).
- Accessibility: dataset designed for storage and uploading to appropriate data portals; guidance provided to ensure consistent use and interpretation.

## Relevance for Environmental Analysts
- Enables analysis of how drought affects farm livelihoods, risk perceptions, and adaptation behaviors in the Ping catchment.
- Supports evaluation of drought communications effectiveness at the local scale.
- Facilitate integration with hydrometeorological and socioeconomic datasets to monitor resilience and policy performance over time.
- Provides a standardized data structure and accompanying guidance to improve data reuse and cross-site comparability.

## Data Quality and Access Considerations
- Anonymisation protects participant privacy; dataset is suitable for sharing within data portals following governance rules.
- Translation/back-translation considerations may affect interpretation; rely on the accompanying STAR Survey Questionnaire for consistent coding.
- Ensure consistent application of the data structure (headers and multi-column encoding) when analyzing multi-choice items.
