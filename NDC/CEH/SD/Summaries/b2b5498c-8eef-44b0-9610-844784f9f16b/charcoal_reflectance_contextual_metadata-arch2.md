# Reflectance of charcoal from tropical rainforest plots in southern Amazonia, Brazil and southwestern Amazonia, Peru

## Data overview
- A dataset titled reflectance.csv containing charcoal reflectance measurements.
- Charcoal pieces collected from the soil surface in tropical rainforest plots (0.25 ha) at Feliz Natal, Brazil (n=75) and Pucallpa, Peru (n=14).
- Total of 89 charcoal pieces measured, with 24 to 90 repetitions per sample.
- Collected in 2015 and associated with multiple projects and funding sources (CAPES Brazil, NERC Do past fires…, SilvaCarbon, UNEMAT PhD project).

## Methods and data collection
- Charcoal pieces collected from the forest floor soil surface (0–5 cm depth).
- Organic material removed using hydrogen peroxide digestion; samples bleached and cleaned.
- Samples embedded in resin and polished.
- Reflectance measured via photometric measurements of incident light reflected from the charcoal surface.
- Instrumentation: TIDAS-MSP 200 microspectrometer with x50 objective (x32 eyepiece); measurements taken at the cell-wall junction.
- Software: MSP200 v3.27; measurements conducted in the Exeter Fire Lab.

## Data characteristics
- Reflectance values are expressed as percentages (%).
- Quality control: failed runs or non-convergent results discarded.

## Data structure and fields
- CSV file columns:
  - Site: sampling area
  - Parcel: parcel identifier within the Site
  - Charcoal: charcoal sample code
  - Reflectance: charcoal reflectance in %

## Study context and provenance
- Sites: Feliz Natal, southern Brazil, and Pucallpa, Peru.
- Year of data collection: 2015.
- Related to broader research on fire, energy release, and charcoal reflectance (e.g., effect of tree wood density on energy release; post-fire assessments).
- Related references and projects listed, indicating data provenance and collaborative support.

## Usage and relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides a standardized, repeatable measurement of charcoal reflectance across sites.
- Facilitates cross-site comparisons of post-fire carbon dynamics and energy release potential.
- Aligns with monitoring workflows that standardize data collection, processing, and reporting.

## Accessibility and data stewardship
- Data are stored and described with clear metadata; the CSV is attached and ready for analysis.
- Emphasizes quality assurance, traceability, and potential integration with other datasets for broader environmental monitoring.
