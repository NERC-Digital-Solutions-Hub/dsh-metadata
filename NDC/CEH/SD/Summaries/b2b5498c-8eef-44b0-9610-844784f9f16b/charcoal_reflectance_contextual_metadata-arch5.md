# Reflectance of charcoal from tropical rainforest plots in southern Amazonia, Brazil and southwestern Amazonia, Peru

## Data overview
- Dataset: reflectance.csv containing charcoal reflectance measurements.
- Samples: 89 charcoal pieces measured in 2015 (Feliz Natal, southern Brazil, n=75; Pucallpa, Peru, n=14).
- Replication: each sample measured 24 to 90 times.
- Funding and affiliations: CAPES Brazil (PVE177-2012); NERC Do past fires explain current carbon dynamics of Amazonian forests?; Charcoal reflectance project; SilvaCarbon; UNEMAT PhD project.
- Data file attached and intended for sharing within research networks.

## Collection methods
- Source material: macroscopic charcoal pieces from the soil surface of forest floors (0–5 cm depth).
- Cleaning: hydrogen peroxide digestion to remove organic material and soil.
- Preparation: samples embedded in resin and polished.
- Reflectance measurement: photometric measurements of the fraction of incident light reflected from the charcoal surface.
- Instrumentation: TIDAS-MSP 200 microspectrometer, x50 objective (x32 eyepiece), MSP200 v3.27 software.
- Laboratory: Exeter Fire Lab.
- Measurement unit: percent reflectance.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Reflectance values expressed as percentages (%).

## Quality control
- Excluded data: failed runs or non-convergent measurements were discarded and not included.

## Details of data structure
- File: reflectance.csv
- Columns:
  - Site: sampling location
  - Parcel: parcel identifier within Site
  - Charcoal: sample code
  - Reflectance: charcoal reflectance value in %

## Data governance and provenance (Data Stewardship focus)
- Clear metadata schema: defined fields (Site, Parcel, Charcoal, Reflectance) enabling traceability of samples and measurements.
- Provenance: linked to specific field sites, collection year (2015), and laboratory processing steps; linked to instrumentation and software version.
- Quality assurance: explicit QA rule (discard failed/non-convergent runs) to ensure data reliability.
- Reproducibility: detailed collection and measurement methods, instrument settings, and processing steps support replication or re-analysis.
- Metadata and sharing readiness: CSV format with explicit column headings and attached dataset; documentation references for method validation and study context.
- Potential use considerations for data stewards: consistent interpretation across sites, replication level per sample, and cross-study comparability considering methodological specifics (H2O2 cleaning, resin embedding, photometric reflectance at cell-wall junction).
