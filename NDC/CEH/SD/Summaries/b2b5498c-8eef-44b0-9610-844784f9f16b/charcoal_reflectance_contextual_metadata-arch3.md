# Reflectance of charcoal from tropical rainforest plots in southern Amazonia, Brazil and southwestern Amazonia, Peru

- This dataset, reflectance.csv, contains charcoal reflectance measurements from soil-surface charcoal in tropical rainforest plots (0.25 ha) at Feliz Natal, Brazil (n=75) and Pucallpa, Peru (n=14), collected in 2015, totaling 89 charcoal pieces with 24–90 repetitions per sample.
- The work is linked to multiple projects and funders, including CAPES Brazil (PVE177-2012), NERC Do past fires explain current carbon dynamics of Amazonian forests?, Charcoal reflectance: A quantitative approach to understanding the impact of fire on an ecosystem (NE/N011570/1, 1628035), SilvaCarbon, and a PhD project at UNEMAT.

- Collection methods
  - Charcoal pieces were collected from the forest floor soil surface (0–5 cm depth).
  - Samples were cleaned by hydrogen peroxide digestion to remove organic material and soil, then embedded in resin and polished.
  - Charcoal reflectance was measured photometrically as the fraction of incident light reflected from the sample surface, at the cell-wall junction.
  - Instrumentation: TIDAS-MSP 200 microspectrometer with a 50x objective (x32 eyepiece), using MSP200 v3.27 software.
  - Measurements conducted in the Exeter Fire Lab; reflectance values are reported as percentages.

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Reflectance values are reported in percent (%).

- Quality control
  - Any failed or non-converging runs were discarded and not included in the dataset.

- Details of data structure
  - The dataset is a comma-separated value (CSV) file with columns including:
    - Site: sampling area
    - Parcel: parcel identifier within the Site
    - Charcoal: sample code
    - Reflectance: charcoal reflectance (%) value

- Context and references
  - Data are embedded in a broader research context on fire impacts and pyrogenic carbon, with key references detailing the interpretation of charcoal reflectance and its relation to energy release in wildfires, as well as methodological development for reflectance measurements. Notable references include Belcher et al. (2018, 2016), Crawford et al. (in press), and New (2020).

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a replicable measurement protocol for charcoal reflectance, enabling assessment of fire impact and carbon dynamics in Amazonian forests.
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data provenance from field collection to laboratory analysis and data recording.
  - Highlights the importance of documenting metadata (site, parcel, sample code) and maintaining quality control (discarding failed runs) for transparent data governance.
  - The dataset is attached as CSV, illustrating practical data sharing within monitoring initiatives, while pointing to the need for ongoing data collection and standardized metadata to support long-term monitoring and comparability across studies.
