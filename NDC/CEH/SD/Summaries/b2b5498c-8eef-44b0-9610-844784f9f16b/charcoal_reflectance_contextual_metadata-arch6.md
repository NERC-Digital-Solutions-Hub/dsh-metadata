# Reflectance of charcoal from tropical rainforest plots in southern Amazonia, Brazil and southwestern Amazonia, Peru

## Data overview
- The dataset reflectance.csv contains charcoal reflectance measurements from soil-surface charcoal pieces collected in tropical rainforest plots.
- Sampling sites: Feliz Natal, southern Brazil (n=75) and Pucallpa, Peru (n=14); total pieces measured = 89.
- Measurements were taken in 2015; each sample had 24 to 90 repetitions.
- The data were part of multiple projects and programs (CAPES Brazil; NERC Do past fires explain current carbon dynamics of Amazonian forests?; Charcoal reflectance project; SilvaCarbon; UNEMAT PhD project).

## Collection methods
- Charcoal pieces were collected from the forest floor at 0–5 cm depth.
- Organic material and soil were removed using hydrogen peroxide digestion.
- Samples were embedded in resin and polished.
- Reflectance was determined photometrically from the fraction of incident light reflected from the sample surface.
- Instrumentation: TIDAS-MSP 200 microspectrometer with x50 objective (x32 eyepiece); measurements taken at the cell-wall junction using MSP200 v3.27 software.
- Measurements conducted in the Exeter Fire Lab.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Reflectance values are reported as percentages (%).

## Quality control
- Any failed runs or non-converging measurements were discarded and not included in the dataset.

## Details of data structure
- Data file: reflectance.csv (CSV format).
- Columns:
  - Site: site where charcoal was sampled.
  - Parcel: parcel identifier within the site.
  - Charcoal: sample code for the charcoal piece.
  - Reflectance: charcoal reflectance value in percent.

## Data provenance and supporting references
- References informing the dataset and methods include:
  - Belcher et al. (2018) on what charcoal reflectance reveals about energy release and pyrogenic carbon.
  - Belcher & Hudspith (2016) on formation of charcoal reflectance and post-fire assessments.
  - Crawford et al. (in press) on tree wood density impact on energy release and charcoal reflectance.

## Notes on use
- The dataset enables cross-site comparisons of charcoal reflectance as a proxy related to fire energy dynamics and pyrogenic carbon properties.
- Users should consider replication ranges (24–90 repeats per sample) and potential site-specific factors when analyzing patterns.
