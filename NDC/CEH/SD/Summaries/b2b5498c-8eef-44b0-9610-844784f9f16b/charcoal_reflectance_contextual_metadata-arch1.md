# Reflectance of charcoal from tropical rainforest plots in southern Amazonia, Brazil and southwestern Amazonia, Peru

- Data overview
  - The reflectance.csv dataset contains charcoal reflectance measurements from macroscopic charcoal pieces collected from the soil surface in tropical rainforest plots (0.25 ha).
  - Sampling locations: Feliz Natal, southern Brazil (n=75 samples) and Pucallpa, Peru (n=14 samples), collected in 2015.
  - Total charcoal pieces measured: 89, with each sample measured repeatedly (minimum 24 and maximum 90 repetitions per sample).
  - Data sources include CAPES Brazil (PVE177-2012), NERC grants on past fires and charcoal reflectance, SilvaCarbon, and a PhD project at UNEMAT.

- Collection methods
  - Charcoal pieces collected from the forest floor at 0–5 cm depth.
  - Organic material and soil removed using hydrogen peroxide digestion to bleach and loosen material.
  - Samples embedded in resin and polished.
  - Charcoal reflectance measured photometrically from the surface (cell-wall junction) using a TIDAS-MSP 200 microspectrometer with x50 objective (x32 eyepiece); MSP200 v3.27 software.
  - All measurements conducted at the Exeter Fire Lab.

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Reflectance values are recorded as percentages (%).

- Quality control
  - Measurements from failed runs or non-converging attempts were discarded and not included in the dataset.

- Details of data structure
  - CSV columns include:
    - Site: sampling area
    - Parcel: parcel identifier within the Site
    - Charcoal: sample code
    - Reflectance: charcoal reflectance in %
