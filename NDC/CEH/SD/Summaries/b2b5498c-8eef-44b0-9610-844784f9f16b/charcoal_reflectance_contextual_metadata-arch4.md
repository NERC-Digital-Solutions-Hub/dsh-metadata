# Reflectance of charcoal from tropical rainforest plots in southern Amazonia, Brazil and southwestern Amazonia, Peru

## Data Overview
- Dataset: reflectance.csv containing charcoal reflectance measurements
- Samples and locations: 89 charcoal pieces from tropical rainforest plots
  - Feliz Natal, southern Brazil (n=75)
  - Pucallpa, Peru (n=14)
- Timeframe: 2015
- Replicates: each sample measured 24 to 90 times
- Funding and affiliation context: tied to CAPES (Brazil), Do past fires explain current carbon dynamics of Amazonian forests?, Charcoal reflectance project, SilvaCarbon, and a Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso (UNEMAT) PhD project

## Collection Methods
- Source: macroscopic charcoal pieces collected from soil surface (0–5 cm depth) on forest floor
- Preparation: remove organic material/soil using hydrogen peroxide digestion
- Sample processing: embed in resin, then polished
- Reflectance measurement: photometric measurement of incident light reflected from the charcoal surface
- Instrumentation: TIDAS-MSP 200 microspectrometer, x50 objective (x32 eyepiece magnification)
- Software: MSP200 v3.27
- Measurement location: Exeter Fire Lab
- Replicates per sample: 24–90

## Nature and Units of Recorded Values
- Reflectance values: percentages (%)

## Quality Control
- Excluded: failed runs or non-converging measurements

## Details of Data Structure
- File format: comma-separated values (CSV)
- Columns:

## Use and Context
- Applications: insights into energy release in wildfires and properties of pyrogenic carbon; supports post-fire assessments
- Related work: connections to tree wood density and fire impact studies; potential to integrate with broader data on fire ecology

## Data Governance and Management Implications (Data Leaders)
- Clear documentation of methods, instrumentation, and QC enhances reproducibility and auditability
- Metadata completeness supports discoverability and integration with other datasets
- The dataset sits within a broader research program; consider persistent identifiers, licensing, and repository deposition to improve accessibility and long-term stewardship
- Scope is geographically limited (two sites) but the detailed methodology enables replication and comparability with similar datasets
- Recommendation: align with data standards, provide comprehensive metadata, and establish data updates or versioning to support ongoing analyses and collaboration across networks
