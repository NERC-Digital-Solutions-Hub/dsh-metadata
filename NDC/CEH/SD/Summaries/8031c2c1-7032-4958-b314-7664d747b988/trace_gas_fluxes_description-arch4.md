- Dataset structure
  - All three files use the same CSV format and share similar variable structures (specific variables not listed in the provided text).
- Methods and data collection
  - Platform and measurement approach
    - Near-continuous greenhouse gas measurements using SkyLine2D, a mobile platform.
    - Sequential, automated measurements of all plots per site with a non-steady state chamber.
    - Lysimeters contain intact soil-vegetation monoliths from unimproved pastures across three geological substrates in the Hampshire Avon catchment.
  - Analyzers and analyte specifics
    - CO2: Infra-red gas analyser (IRGA, model Li-Cor 8100).
    - CH4: Campaign-mode measurements using Fast Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (FGGA; model 907-0010).
    - N2O: Campaign-mode measurements using Isotopic N2O Analyzer (INA; model 914-0027) from Los Gatos Research.
  - Measurement protocol
    - Chamber closure: 180 seconds (extended to 300 seconds in campaign-mode).
    - CO2 data processing: Li-Cor 8100 software (v2.0.0) with a 60-second deadband; quality control excludes poorly fitted slopes (R^2 < 0.7) or highly variable fluxes (CV > 50%) not near zero (fluxes between -0.5 and 0.5 µmol CO2 m^-2 s^-1).
    - CH4 and N2O processing: linear regression with similar quality-control criteria as CO2.
- Data quality and provenance implications for Data Leaders
  - Clear documentation of instruments, measurement durations, and QC criteria supports reproducibility and cross-site comparability.
  - Well-defined metadata elements (location, site description, instrument models, deposition contact) aid discoverability and governance.
  - Metadata gaps to consider (noted in broader challenges): detailed variable definitions, calibration records, and broader metadata standards to ensure consistency and discoverability across datasets.
- Access and contact
  - Primary depositor: James Stockdale; contact: james.stockdale@york.ac.uk
  - Data appears to be described with explicit measurement methods, site coordinates, and timeframes to enable assessment of suitability and potential reuse.
