- Datasets structure
  - All three files share the same CSV format; they are described as having the same variables (specific variable list not provided in the summary).
- Methods used to generate the data
  - Experimental setup
    - Near-continuous greenhouse gas measurements using a novel suspended mobile platform (SkyLine2D).
    - Measurements taken on lysimeters containing intact monoliths of soils and vegetation from unimproved pastures.
    - Three different underlying geologies within the Hampshire Avon catchment.
  - Gases and instrumentation
    - CO2: Infra-Red Gas Analyzer (Li-Cor Li-Cor 8100; model 8100).
    - CH4: Campaign-mode measurements with Fast Greenhouse Gas Analyzer (FGGA; model 907-0010; Los Gatos Research).
    - N2O: Campaign-mode measurements with Isotopic N2O Analyzer (INA; model 914-0027; Los Gatos Research).
  - Measurement protocol
    - Flux measurements via chamber closure for 180 seconds; extended to 300 seconds in campaign-mode.
    - Deadband for CO2 flux: 60 seconds.
    - Flux calculations: CO2 using Li-Cor 8100 software (version 2.0.0); CH4 and N2O fluxes calculated via linear regression.
  - Quality control (QC)
    - Post-flux QC to remove poorly fitted slopes (R^2 < 0.7) or highly variable fluxes (CV > 50%) not close to zero (calculated fluxes between -0.5 and 0.5 μmol CO2 m^-2 s^-1).
    - QC criteria for CH4 and N2O fluxes implemented in a similar manner to CO2.
- Notes on data interpretation
  - Data represent near-continuous gas flux measurements across three sites/geologies using a combination of fixed and campaign-mode measurement approaches.
  - Flux values are subjected to strict QC, which may result in data loss for periods not meeting the fit/variability thresholds.
