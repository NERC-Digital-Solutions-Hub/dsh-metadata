# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Overview and aim
- Documents the evolution of the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
- Links the sampling framework to the ITE Land Classification, developed over 30 years, to provide a representative, stratified approach for national and country-level environmental estimates.
- Emphasizes the need for stratification to reduce bias and to enable robust estimation of habitat areas and changes over time.

## Key concept: stratified environmental classification (ITE Land Classification)
- Sampling uses stratified, random selection within environmental strata to ensure samples represent the full range of land types.
- Land Classification began with analysing environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to group land into classes, allowing efficient, representative sampling across Great Britain.
- Early approach used a center square from a 15x15 km grid with surrounding squares also classified to form 6040 classified squares; eight samples per land class were selected for the national survey.

## Chronology of CS surveys and sampling framework

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to classify land into 32 classes from 1228 central 1 km squares.
  - Four surrounding squares added to each center square, yielding 6039 km squares classified.
  - 8 km squares per Land Class surveyed, total of 256 samples.
  - National estimates computed as mean habitat area per square in each class times area of the class.

- 1984 – 2nd Field Survey
  - Sampling increased to 12 km squares per land class (384 total).
  - Estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification; limited national reporting.

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990): All Squares Land Classification
  - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB (all 1 km squares) using key environmental surrogates.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping recorded.
  - Use of the first Land Classification framework for national estimates remained, but groundwork laid for finer resolution.

- Developments leading to CS1990–CS2000
  - Realisation that class representations varied regionally; attempts to classify every GB square used surrogates due to computing limits.
  - When comparing original 1228-square classification with newer attempts, only 62% exact correspondence; neighbouring class assignments preserved average characteristics, but distribution across classes shifted.
  - Changes affected regional and local estimates; motivated further refinement.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000): separate country estimates
  - CS1990 classifications crossed country boundaries; need emerged for England & Wales vs Scotland reporting using country-specific squares.
  - Implemented country-unit subdivision of land classes, class aggregation where necessary, and added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes (minimum 6 squares per new class).
  - Wales-specific adjustments: sub-divided Land Class 17 in Wales; Wales became the most intensively sampled country unit.
  - Isle of Man replaced by new squares in England for country-unit reporting.
  - Included an uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- 2007 – Developments for CS2007: Wales-only reporting and further refinements
  - Wales required independent reporting; 64 Welsh squares were previously added, but precision for Wales-only reporting needed more.
  - Land Classes sub-divided into country-unit versions for England & Wales (creating five new Welsh/English sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), expanding to 45 strata.
  - Added 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation of new Welsh classes (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class).
  - English coverage adjusted accordingly; two English classes (5e, 15e) retained only 4 squares each; scoping study deemed precision loss acceptable for reporting.

## Sampling framework details and outputs

- CS2000
  - Expanded strata to 40 (from 32) after country-unit sub-divisions and aggregations.
  - Provided country-specific sampling schemes and a detailed per-class, per-country distribution (table-like summaries in the report).
  - Included upland habitat sampling to bolster country-level estimates in uplands.

- CS2007
  - Re-opened Wales-only reporting with country-specific sub-classes and adjusted sampling to 45 strata (45 classes total with country subdivisions).
  - Wales received 43 additional squares; England retained most of its allocated squares, with some reductions in a pair of classes.
  - Wales required enhanced representation of Welsh sub-classes to improve Wales-only estimates.

- Overall sampling progress
  - England & Wales combined: substantial base sampling across multiple land classes with country-specific allocations.
  - Scotland: continued separate reporting with its own class structure; specific counts per class adjusted to ensure adequate representation.

## National estimates and methodological notes

- National estimates have historically depended on the chosen Land Classification and the corresponding sample distribution.
- The 2006 Scoping Study highlighted that switching between classifications (latest vs. original) affects consistency of stock estimates; preference for using the latest classification within a given survey for internal consistency, while the original classification provides cross-survey comparability.
- The documentation provides detailed notes on the number of squares per class per survey and the impact of reclassification on stratum representation and national estimates.

## Key takeaways for data-informed interpretation
- Countryside Survey’s sampling strategy is deeply data-driven, relying on a stratified random framework anchored to the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative coverage across GB and its constituent countries.
- The methodology has evolved to address devolution-driven needs (Wales, Scotland) and to improve estimates in uplands and other under-sampled areas.
- Updates from CS1990 through CS2007 reflect balancing computational feasibility, data representativeness, and policy/research demands for country-specific environmental insights.
