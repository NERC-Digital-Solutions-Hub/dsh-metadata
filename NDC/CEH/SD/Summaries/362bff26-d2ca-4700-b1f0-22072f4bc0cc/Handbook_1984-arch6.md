# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Overview and purpose
  - A field data collection guide for a multi-year ecological survey of Great Britain (Project 424), establishing a standardized method to map and record land cover, land use, habitats, and landscape features.
  - Surveys operate on 1:10,000 scale maps, recording data for 384 squares (12 per 32 land classes) across GB to build a quality baseline for future change detection (ground vs. aerial assessment) and to enable partial replacement sampling.
  - Emphasis on compatibility with previous surveys and on creating data items that support linking with grid-based data and other datasets.

- Planning and field logistics
  - Survey teams from six ITE research stations, with liaison from Merlewood; squares grouped into seven groups for coverage.
  - Each square requires about one day to survey; planning prioritizes minimizing travel, avoiding double-visits, and managing schedule within travel constraints.
  - Practical planning options include traveling daily, overnight stays for multiple squares, or short group deployments.

- Equipment and tools
  - Minimal equipment focused on mapping and recording rather than physical measurement.
  - Provided: FABs (Field Assessment Booklets), 6" maps, field films, handouts, colored pens, navigation aids, ID cards, clipboards, pencils, weather gear, reference books, and camera.

- Field procedures
  - On-site workflow includes assessing access, obtaining permissions for the entire square, choosing a route to cover the square, and reviewing records after recording to ensure completeness and clarity.
  - Permissions are essential to access all parts of the square and to gain goodwill/background information from landowners; a pre-contact approach is common but can cause delays.

- Data recording and coding framework
  - Data are annotated on 6" (1:10,000) maps using a structured coding system; numeric codes are combined in boxes to produce concise, machine-usable descriptors.
  - The minimum mappable unit is 0.5 hectares and a maximum square unit has predefined mapable lengths; surveyors must document edge conditions and ensure the smallest corner of the square is recorded.
  - Codes can be combined to represent complex mosaics (e.g., vegetation types, cover percentages, and species presence); color coding is used for complex or built-up areas to reduce clutter.

- FAB structure and data entry
  - Each square is documented in a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) with a standardized page sequence:
    - Cover and location details, ownership, farmer/landowner information, physiography/inland water/coastal, agriculture/natural vegetation, forestry/woodland/trees, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications, photography, and post-survey procedures.
  - Openness to add non-standard categories if necessary, with clear guidance on how to record such data.

- Ownership, permissions, and farmer interactions
  - Ownership sheet tracks which land units belong to which owner, tenant status, and cooperation levels (0 = not available; 1–3 = varying degrees of cooperation).
  - Farmer/Landowner Information sheet records background conversations to contextualize land use and permissions; surveyors are encouraged to engage with at least one farmer per square.

- Key data sheets and example contents
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal (codes 1–65)
    - Includes cliffs, rock outcrops, peat types, dunes, inland waters (lakes, ponds, rivers, canals), drainage features (ditches, tile drains), springs, levees, and shoreline types.
    - Coastal features and water bodies are mapped with corresponding classification and substrate details.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation (cover types 100–199)
    - A comprehensive set of cover types (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, crops, fallow/abandoned land).
    - Species lists and proportions to accompany major vegetation communities; notes on curtilage distinctions (built-up areas affecting recording).
    - Includes crop observations, livestock uses, and production uses (e.g., produce for sale, silage, breeding).
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees (codes 200–299)
    - Woodland types, coppice, hedgerows, lines of trees, belts, and individual trees with descriptive attributes (age, height classes, proportions, regeneration, underplanting, plantations, unmanaged status).
    - Distinctions among trees, shrubs, scrub, and lines of trees; provisions for recording species and management descriptions.
  - Boundaries (301–338)
    - Detailed boundary types (e.g., mortared walls, hedges, fences, stockproof boundaries) and descriptors; gaps or filled gaps indicating boundary alterations.
  - Recreation (371–379)
    - Formal and informal recreation areas, school/play spaces, golf courses, race tracks, boating/harbor features, and other land uses that support recreation.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications (401–472)
    - Built cover types, building uses (residential, commercial, industrial, public services, educational/cultural, religious, institutional), and associated descriptions.
    - Infrastructure elements including roads (462–464), tracks (465–466), footpaths (467–468), and barriers or signage (e.g., speed limits, bridges, pylons).
    - Color conventions are provided to aid map readability and category differentiation.
  - Photography
    - Five photographs per square, with precise marking of camera locations and viewpoints; arrows indicate general view direction; the first photo aligns with the FAB front cover.
  - Post-survey and data handling
    - After fieldwork, check sheets for omissions; avoid unnecessary transcription to fresh maps; batch submission of FAB squares to Merlewood for processing and archiving.

- Data quality, compatibility, and usage
  - Emphasizes decision-making in the field by the surveyor to minimize later interpretation; citations and qualifiers should accompany ambiguous observations.
  - Designed to be compatible with previous grid-based surveys, enabling data fusion, comparison over time, and integration with other datasets.
  - Acknowledges that some categories may not have a direct one-to-one mapping to all survey contexts; surveyors should annotate atypical cases with comments or qualifiers.
  - The coding approach (numeric codes plus alpha or color annotations) is intended to facilitate consistent data entry, storage, and later data products.

- Data products and potential uses for Data Support
  - The standardized, code-based dataset supports creating dashboards, GIS layers, and self-serve tools for end users to explore land cover, habitat distribution, and landscape features.
  - Data can be combined with other spatial or attribute datasets to analyze land-use change, habitat quality, fragmentation, and landscape planning.
  - The structure supports longitudinal analyses by maintaining consistent categories and mapping units across survey cycles, aiding policy, planning, and environmental monitoring.

- Endnote on scope and intent
  - The handbook provides a comprehensive, repeatable framework for field data collection across GB, balancing practical field constraints with a robust, codified data structure to enable future insights and data-driven decision-making.
