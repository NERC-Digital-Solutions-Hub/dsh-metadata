# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- DOCUMENT traces the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its use as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes the link between classification, stratified sampling, and national habitat/land-use estimates for Great Britain (GB), with increasing emphasis on country-specific reporting (England with Wales; Scotland; Wales separately).
- Highlights methodological changes, data lineage, and the rationale for updating classifications to meet policy and reporting needs.

## Core concepts: stratified sampling and land classification
- Stratified sampling: divides land into discrete strata (land classes) to ensure representative sampling and reduce bias.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) define 32 original classes, later expanded/modifed to around 40–45 classes to improve representativeness and country-specific reporting.
- Sample unit: 1 km squares; initial work classified center squares (and surrounding squares) to establish GB-wide strata.

## Timeline of sampling framework development
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
  - ISA-based approach used on 1228 center 1 km squares; 8 samples per Land Class (total 256 squares) surveyed in a single field season.
  - National habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square multiplied by land-class area.
- 1984 (Second field survey)
  - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per Land Class (384 total); Australia-wide approach retained but with increased sample size.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; added Land Cover Map linkage.
  - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; fourth field survey)
  - Land Classification updated to enable separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
  - GB-wide sampling adjusted to reflect new classification; regional estimates began to reflect policy-driven needs.
- 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000; fifth field survey)
  - Addressed issues from the 1990 classification changes; introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales; Scotland) with 40 strata expanded to 40+.
  - Additional squares allocated to ensure representation of new classes; upland habitat sampling module introduced.
- 2007 (Revised Land Classification; sixth field survey)
  - Devolution-driven need for Wales-only reporting formalized; created Wales-specific sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expanded to 45 strata.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares; England’s classes adjusted to preserve representation; Welsh class sub-divisions respected in all sampling allocations.

## Country-specific reporting and classification adjustments
- Separate country estimates (CS2000 onward) required:
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into England-with-Wales and Scotland country units.
  - Aggregation where a country lacked sufficient squares for a class, to maintain robust estimates.
  - Extra sampling to ensure adequate representation of newly created country-specific classes (minimums per class).
  - Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced.
- Wales-specific reporting prompted Welsh-only class subdivisions and increased Welsh sampling in 2007.

## Uplands module and its purpose
- CS2000 included an uplands module (30 additional squares) to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Aimed to strengthen country-based estimates for habitats in upland regions, addressing under-sampling in those areas.

## Data governance, quality, and interpretation considerations
- Note on national estimates: shifting classifications across surveys affects cross-survey comparability; GB estimates can be produced using the latest country-specific classifications or the original (1990) Land Classification. Preference for consistency with the specific survey, while cross-survey consistency favors the original framework.
- Increased complexity in class structures (from 32 to 40–45 classes) improves representation but requires careful handling when aggregating or comparing across survey years.
- Class sub-divisions and country aggregations create 40–45 strata (depending on year), affecting sampling rates and precision.
- Data outputs historically linked to publication reports (CS1990 main report; CS2000; CS2007 UK Results) and to scoping/technical studies guiding design decisions.

## Outputs and documentation
- Primary outputs include national habitat/land-use estimates derived from stratum-level data, with country-specific reporting.
- Documentation and references span multiple CEH/DOE publications (e.g., Countryside Survey reports) and methodological papers on the ITE Land Classification.
- The appendix and acknowledgments credit foundational work and subsequent statistical guidance shaping the sampling strategy.
