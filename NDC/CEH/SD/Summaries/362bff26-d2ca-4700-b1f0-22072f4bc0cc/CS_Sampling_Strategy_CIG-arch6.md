# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - This document documents the evolution of the sampling strategy and the ITE Land Classification used to stratify field samples for Countryside Survey from 1978 through 2007.
  - The Countryside Survey methodology is tightly linked to its 30-year lineage; changes aim to improve representativeness, enable country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland), and support policy-relevant outputs.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure samples represent different land types and ecological conditions.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) aggregated into land classes to define strata for survey sampling.
  - Early approach used 1 km squares classified by environmental variables; sampling within each class yields national habitat estimates.

- Chronology of development
  - 1978 (First Survey): 1 km squares central to a 15x15 km grid; 32 land classes; 8 samples per class (256 total); data on vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
  - 1984 (Second Survey): sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); still used the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares and 3rd Field Survey): Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; added a Land Cover Map from satellite imagery; some quadrats repeated; national estimates recalculated with the updated framework.
  - 1998 (Revised Classification for CS1990): Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to support regional reporting; national estimates began enabling Scotland reporting; groundwork for country-level estimates.
  - 2000 (CS2000): emphasis on separate country estimates (England with Wales vs Scotland); sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit variants; creation of 40 strata with sampled squares; additional squares added to improve representation of new classes; upland habitat sampling proposed as a separate module.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-specific reporting requirements led to further Welsh sub-divisions (five new Welsh classes, total 45 strata); 43 extra squares allocated to Wales; England adjustments left some classes with as few as 4 squares; Isle of Man squares removed or replaced; overall expanded Welsh sampling to enable Wales-only outputs; upland and marginal upland habitats received targeted sampling.

- Sampling framework and outputs
  - 1 km square framework
    - Each square is classified into Land Classes; squares are sampled within classes to estimate land-use and habitat features.
  - Sample sizes and distribution
    - 1978: 256 squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
    - 1984: 384 squares (12 per class across 32 classes).
    - 1990: 508 squares; all GB squares reclassified; some changes to class assignments.
    - 2000: expanded to support country-unit estimates; total framework expanded to 40 strata with country-subdivided classes.
    - 2007: 45 strata (Welsh sub-classes added); Wales receives substantial additional sampling; England adjustments maintain overall precision.
  - Country-specific estimates
    - England with Wales and Scotland reporting developed; Wales received particular attention to enable Wales-only outputs; Isle of Man entirely excluded from country-unit estimates and replaced by additional England squares when needed.
  - Uplands module
    - An additional module in CS2000 allocated 30 squares in upland/marginal upland Land Classes to improve habitat estimates in uplands, funded by multiple government bodies.
  - National estimates methodology
    - National habitat areas are derived from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
    - Changes in the Land Classification across survey years can affect consistency of national estimates; the document notes a preference for using the most recent classification for country-specific estimates while recognizing cross-survey comparability concerns.

- Data quality and comparability considerations
  - Changing classifications can alter the comparability of national estimates across surveys.
  - To maintain consistency, national estimates for cross-survey comparisons may use the earlier classification, but country-unit estimates typically adopt the latest classification framework.
  - The evolution from the 1978 system to the 2007 system reflects improved granularity and capability to deliver Wales- and England-specific, Scotland-specific outputs.

- Summary of survey outputs and references
  - CS1978: initial Land Classification with 256 squares; national estimates published in subsequent literature.
  - CS1984: expanded sampling; results published with a focus on changes in landscape.
  - CS1990: full GB Land Classification applied to all squares; satellite land-cover integration; 508 squares surveyed.
  - CS2000: refined to support England+Wales vs Scotland country reporting; upland module introduced; 40 strata; increased country-specific sampling.
  - CS2007: refined for Wales-only reporting; increased Welsh sampling and new Welsh Land Classes; total 45 strata; upland sampling continued.

  - The document acknowledges contributions from statisticians, ecologists, and institutions; it also lists extensive references detailing the development and application of the ITE Land Classification and Countryside Survey methodologies.

- Practical takeaways for data support
  - The Countryside Survey demonstrates a rigorous, evolution-based approach to environmental sampling, prioritizing stratification, representativeness, and country-specific policy needs.
  - When using or extending this dataset, preserve the classification framework relevant to your reporting unit and be aware of the implications of changing land classifications on trend analyses.
  - Consider maintaining parallel outputs: a stable historic classification for trend comparability and a current classification for up-to-date country-level reporting.
