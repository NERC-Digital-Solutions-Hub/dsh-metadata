# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Purpose and scope
- Documents the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007, the latest in a long series linked to the ITE Land Classification.
- Emphasizes understanding how current sampling is derived from past methods to support time-series analysis of countryside environments.
- Aims to provide representative, comparable environmental data to monitor change and policy performance over time.

## Core concepts: stratified sampling and land classification
- Stratified, random sampling is used to avoid bias and ensure representation of diverse land types and ecological processes.
- The ITE Land Classification is the theoretical basis for stratification, grouping land into discrete classes using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- Early work used a 1 km square sample unit; classification was built from environmental data and interpreted to create stratified samples across Great Britain.

## The ITE Land Classification: a historical overview
- Originated in the 1970s from work in Cumbria and the Lake District, shifting from plant quadrats to landscape-scale environmental attributes.
- Initial version produced 32 land classes using a multivariate approach (Indicator Species Analysis) on 1 km squares.
- Practical sampling used the centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid; surrounding squares were allocated to classes to create a total of 6039 km squares classified for the original framework.
- Over successive surveys (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007), the land classification was revised to improve national and regional representativeness and to accommodate devolved administrations (Scotland, Wales, England).

## Timeline and evolution of the Countryside Survey sampling framework
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - 32 land classes; 1228 squares classified; 6039 km squares represented; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class).
  - National estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class multiplied by the land class area.
- 1984 (Second GB Land Use Survey)
  - Framework retained, sample size increased by 50% (12 squares per class; total 384).
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
  - Expanded to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Linked to first Land Cover Map (from satellite data); some squares changed class due to the updated framework.
  - National estimates recalculated with the new, comprehensive classification.
- 2000 (CS2000)
  - Addressed policy needs to report separate England & Wales vs Scotland estimates.
  - Land Classification extended to cover all GB squares with country-unit sub-divisions; 40 strata created through class subdivision and aggregation where needed.
  - Added a dedicated upland module to improve accuracy for upland habitats.
- 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting needs prompted further adjustments.
  - Welsh sub-divisions created (five new country-unit classes); total strata increased to 45.
  - Additional Welsh squares added to ensure representation; some English classes retained smaller samples (e.g., 4 squares) to balance precision and practicality.
  - England and Wales share revised class maps, with Scotland prepared separately.

## Country-specific considerations and modules
- Separate country estimates
  - 1990 framework allowed cross-border classification; later efforts created England & Wales and Scotland-specific estimates using country-only squares.
- Wales-focused adjustments (CS2007)
  - Introduced country-unit subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to enable Wales-only reporting.
  - Increased Welsh sampling (additional squares) to ensure sufficient representation in all Welsh classes.
- England adjustments
  - With the removal of some Welsh squares in CS2007, two English classes were left with only 4 squares each; intended precision deemed acceptable per scoping work.
- Isle of Man
  - Removed from country-unit estimates; new squares allocated in England.

## Wales uplands and additional sampling
- Uplands module (CS2000) added 30 upland squares in England and Wales to improve habitat estimates in upland areas, reflecting policy and management needs for these landscapes.

## Outputs and data use
- Outputs include habitat areas and landscape change indicators derived from classified squares, enabling trend analysis and policy evaluation over time.
- Data underpin national and country-level estimates and support reporting against environmental objectives and legislation.

## Data management and accessibility
- A key challenge for Analysts Monitoring the Environment is to maximize the value of these datasets by integrating them with other environmental data and ensuring access to underlying data used to produce final outputs.
- The framework emphasizes standardized formats, clear documentation, and archiving of datasets to portals for reuse and scrutiny.

## Note on national estimates and consistency
- Changing the basic land classification used for national estimates can affect the consistency of stock estimates across surveys.
- Preferred approach for consistency is to use the latest classification for country estimates, while acknowledging historical comparability considerations.
- The document includes historical tables showing sample sizes and strata under different classifications, highlighting the evolution and its impact on comparability.
