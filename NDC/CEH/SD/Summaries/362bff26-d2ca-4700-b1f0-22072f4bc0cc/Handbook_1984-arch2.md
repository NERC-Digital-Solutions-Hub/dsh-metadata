# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Aim and context
- Establish a consistent, high-quality baseline for rural environment data to monitor environmental health and changes over time.
- Part of a longitudinal program (building on Project 424 Ecological Survey of Great Britain) to compare ground survey data with aerial photography and record land cover, land use, and habitat changes.
- Survey areas: 384 1 km2 squares across Great Britain (12 squares from each of 32 land classes), concentrating on land cover, land use, and habitat features that align with landscape objectives and prior surveys.

## Sampling and planning
- Squares are grouped into seven sets for survey by teams from six ITE research stations; each team surveys roughly 56 squares with liaison from Merlewood.
- Each square is planned to take about one day of survey work; accessible sites prioritized to minimize travel time and cost.
- Three planning options are suggested for travel logistics, including day trips, one-night stays for multiple squares, or longer blocks.
- Emphasis on efficiency: avoid double visits if possible; travel costs are a major budget consideration.

## Equipment
- Minimal field equipment; primarily mapping and recording tools.
- Provided items: FABs (Field Assessment Booklets), 1:10,000 maps, field handouts, coloured pens, navigation tools, identity cards, clipboards, pencils, weather gear, reference books, and camera.

## Field procedure
- On arrival: assess the area, identify access/permissions, and plan full coverage of the square.
- Seek permissions for access to the entire square before surveying; secure goodwill and background information from landowners.
- Choose an efficient route to cover the square; ensure complete data collection and time for cross-checks after surveying.

## Permissions and access
- Obtain permission to access all parts of each square to avoid wasted effort if access is refused mid-survey.
- Prior contact with owners can help, but formal permission is preferred to avoid delays; an ITE identity card aids legitimacy.
- Update ownership lists from the previous survey to inform access and potential follow-up surveys.

## Data recording and FAB (Field Assessment Booklet)
- Data are mapped onto 6" (1:10,000) maps using a standardized coding system to annotate features.
- Data codes are combined in boxes to represent multiple attributes compactly; alpha codes follow numeric sequences (e.g., boundary, vegetation, etc.).
- Each square’s data are consolidated into an FAB, with pages organized but not strictly sequential.
- Guidelines include: recording owner/tenant details, farm interviews, and careful notation of species, cover types, and landscape features.
- Where mosaics or complex units exist, proportional coding and color coding are recommended to represent complexity without clutter.

## Data coding and maps
- Use predefined codes for physiography, land cover, vegetation, soils, boundaries, buildings, and infrastructure.
- Emphasize accurate boundary demarcation on maps and clear coding for edge cases, junctions, and partial boundaries.
- Smallest mappable unit is about 0.5 hectares and 0.2 kilometers in length; even the square corners should be surveyed and coded.

## Major data sections and content (at-a-glance)
- Ownership: identify and mark ownership of all parts of the square; distinguish tenants from owners; rate owner cooperativeness for future access.
- Farmer/Landowner Information: collect conversational background data to support stakeholder engagement and background context, without obligating the interviewer to a formal questionnaire.
- Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed coding for cliffs, rock features, peat, erosion, water bodies, ditches, springs, levees, shores, and related landforms.
- Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: record ground cover types, crops, pastures, moorland, heath, marsh, ferried vegetation, and crop specifics; include notes on management practices and land use within curtilages.
- Forestry/Woodland/Trees: map woodland units, tree species, structure (crop/stand/regen), age classes, density, management status, and plantations; differentiate woodlands, coppice, belts, hedgerows, and individual trees.
- Boundaries: classify boundary types (walls, hedges, fences, gates) and provide descriptive context; mark gaps and changes in stockproof boundaries.
- Recreation: document formal and informal recreation areas and uses.
- Buildings/Structures/Communications: record built cover types, uses, descriptions, and associated infrastructure (roads, tracks, bridges, signs, pylons, etc.); apply color-coding conventions for quick interpretation.
- Photography: take five slides per square from prescribed viewpoints; mark exact photo locations and directions on FAB maps for reproducibility.

## Post-survey procedures
- Review data and maps after surveying to check for omissions or inconsistencies.
- Transcribing to new maps is discouraged unless necessary; preserve original maps and FABs whenever possible.
- Report submission and batch handling: notify Merlewood upon completion of each batch and arrange transport of FABs for processing.

## Practical challenges and goals
- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating with additional data sources beyond single-use outputs.
- Facilitating broader access to underlying data used to generate final survey outputs, enabling reuse and extended analysis.

## Relevance for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Provides a standardized, long-term, geographically extensive data framework ideal for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Encourages data quality assurance, consistent methodology, and accessible datasets suitable for comparison across time and space.
- Supports combining survey data with other environmental datasets to enhance value and enable broader analyses.
