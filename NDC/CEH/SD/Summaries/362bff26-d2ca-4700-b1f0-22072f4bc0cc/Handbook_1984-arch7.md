# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIROMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Purpose and scope
  - 1984 update to a field survey framework for the Ecological Survey of Great Britain (Project 424, initiated 1976).
  - Objective: create map-based data products (primarily 1:10,000 scale) to document land cover, land use, habitats, and associated features across Great Britain.
  - Approach: combine ground survey data with aerial photography to establish a quality baseline and enable future change assessments; 384 squares (12 from each of 32 land classes) selected for GB coverage; data items chosen to align with landscape objectives and ensure compatibility with previous surveys.

- Survey design and sampling
  - Samples organized into seven groups, surveyed by teams from six ITE research stations (with liaison from Merlewood); each square ~1 person-day to survey.
  - Planning considerations:
    - Avoid visiting a site twice if possible to manage costs and schedules.
    - Travel-based daily planning to meet cost assumptions (no overnight subsistence).
    - Several planning options for grouping squares (e.g., travel from stations, single-night stays, or multi-day groupings).

- Field equipment and logistics
  - Minimal required equipment since the task is mapping and recording rather than heavy measurement.
  - Equipment categories:
    - Provided: FAB data sheets, 6" (1:10,000) maps, film, instruction handouts, colored pens, maps, navigation gear, ID card, clipboard, pencils, weather gear, reference books, camera.
    - Optional: personal items as needed.
  - Emphasis on using available travel and mapping tools efficiently.

- Field procedures and permissions
  - On arrival: surveyors should survey the surroundings, identify access issues, and orient themselves.
  - Permissions: obtain consent to access all parts of the square; essential to avoid wasted work if access is refused mid-survey.
  - Farmer/landowner engagement: collect background information via an interview where possible; carry ITE ID; maintain a low-profile presence to encourage cooperation.
  - Ownership records: update and supplement ownership data sheets; mark land units by owner number and note tenant or changing ownership where relevant.

- Data recording and coding
  - Core activity: annotate 6" maps with a standardized set of data codes; sometimes combine multiple codes within a single map unit to describe complex features.
  - Coding system: use numeric codes with supporting alpha characters to encode combined information; boxes on data sheets facilitate multi-code entries.
  - Map unit conventions: minimum mappable area is 1/50 hectare; units have defined lengths; decisions should be made in the field by the surveyor.
  - Boundary marking: clearly delineate boundaries on maps; indicate boundary types with appropriate codes and perpendicular markers where needed.
  - Edge coverage: survey the smallest field corner and the square edge to ensure complete coverage.

- FAB (Field Assessment Booklet) structure and data entry
  - FAB pages consolidate all survey data for a square and are linked to the 6" maps.
  - Key sections:
    - 1 Cover: series number and location details.
    - 2 Ownership: ownership and tenancy codes; owner cooperativeness ratings.
    - 3 Farmer/Landowner Information: background conversation notes and prompts (conducted tactfully).
    - 4 Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: features such as cliffs, rock outcrops, peat, erosion indicators, inland waters, rivers, canals, ditches, springs, levees, and associated mapping notes.
    - 5 Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: ground cover types, crops, pasture, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, marshes, flushes, and species associations; includes scale and height/age qualifiers where relevant.
    - 6 Forestry/Woodland/Trees: woodland/forest classifications, tree and shrub categories, age classes, regeneration, plantations, hedgerows, belts, and related descriptors; guidance on spacing, density, and use designations (amenity, recreation, shelter, etc.).
    - 7 Boundaries: boundary types, descriptions, and stockproofing status; emphasis on recording boundaries associated with curtilages.
    - 8 Recreation: formal and informal recreational use areas and signage.
    - 9 Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, descriptions, non-built structures, and transport/utility features; color-coding guidance to aid map readability.
    - 10 Photography: five photos per square with precise location and directional notes; front FAB page anchors photography.
    - 11 Procedure subsequent to survey: post-survey checks, data integrity, and transport of finished FAB squares; preference for using original maps if possible; coordination with Merlewood on batch completion.
  - Colour conventions: recommended color scheme to differentiate land-use and structure types on maps (e.g., residential vs. agricultural, green for curtilages with trees, yellow for residential buildings, blue for public services, etc.).

- Photography and documentation
  - Five photographs per square to capture representative views; location and orientation marked on FAB and map.

- Post-survey processes
  - Review all data promptly to avoid omissions; avoid unnecessary data transcription unless essential.
  - Inform Merlewood as batches are completed; arrange transportation of finished FAB squares.

- Coding detail and GIS relevance
  - Extensive, predefined code lists for physiography, land cover, vegetation, soils, crops, boundaries, roads, buildings, and more.
  - Codes enable structured attribute data to accompany spatial features on 6" maps; supports integration into GIS workflows and future cross-project comparisons.
  - Emphasis on data standardization, consistency with prior surveys, and the ability to document changes over time via ground and aerial observations.

- Practical considerations and challenges for GIS specialists
  - Standardization across data sources and resolutions is crucial to enable reliable integration into GIS products.
  - Large and complex datasets require careful data cleaning, coding, and documentation to maintain usability.
  - Access permissions and local cooperation significantly influence data completeness and quality.
  - The framework supports multi-layer GIS products by organizing information into thematic sheets (physiography, vegetation, forestry, boundaries, built environment, etc.) and mapping units with explicit coding rules.

- Overall output and intended GIS-friendly deliverables
  - A harmonized set of map-based data layers for GB, derived from field-recorded codes and annotated 6" maps.
  - A reproducible methodology to compare ground survey results with aerial photography data over time, contributing to landscape-level analyses and policy-relevant GIS products.
