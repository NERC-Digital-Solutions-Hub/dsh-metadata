# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Purpose and scope
- Field manual for a national ecological survey (Project 424) in Great Britain.
- Aimed to establish a robust baseline of land cover, habitat and landscape features for future change detection.
- Combines ground survey with aerial photography to compare effectiveness of ground vs. aerial methods.
- Focuses on 1 km grid areas (1 x 1 squares) across Great Britain; data items chosen for practicality, compatibility with previous surveys, and relevance to landscape objectives.

## Study design and sampling
- Ground survey of 384 squares (12 per each of 32 land classes) in 1984; based on earlier 256 squares (from 32 classes) surveyed in 1977/78.
- Emphasis on land cover, land use, habitat features, and related landscape data.
- Plan to maintain statistical confidence and allow partial replacement sampling in the future.
- Sample squares may have exceptions where original squares could not be surveyed.

## Field operations and planning
- Teams from six ITE research stations conduct surveys; liaison with a Merlewood-based team for some squares.
- Each square planned to take about a day to survey; travel time is a major cost driver.
- Several planning options: daily travel visits, one-night stays for two squares, or longer periods for multiple squares.
- Permissions are essential to access all parts of the square and to maintain goodwill with landowners; a form of prior contact is encouraged.

## Equipment and field logistics
- Minimal equipment: mainly mapping and recording tools.
- Provided: FAB data recording booklets, 6" (1:10,000) maps, film, field-handouts, colored pens, maps for site locations, navigation tools, ITE identity card, camera, weatherproof clothing, etc.
- Emphasis on using travel to cover squares to keep costs manageable.

## Data recording and coding system
- Survey is essentially a mapping exercise annotated on 6" maps with coded data.
- Data items are recorded via numeric and alpha codes within structured FAB pages; codes can be combined to describe complex features.
- In-field decisions should be made by surveyors; results must be clearly documented, with qualifiers where necessary.
- A standardized, hierarchical coding approach covers multiple domains (e.g., boundary types, vegetation assemblages, species, proportions, age, and management histories).
- Color conventions are provided for mapping when numeric coding becomes cluttered.
- Smallest mapable unit specified (0.5 ha by about 0.2 km), with careful edge and corner coverage to ensure complete square records.

## Data items and sections (highlights)
- Ownership and access: ownership, tenancy, and cooperative indicators; changes in ownership since 1977/78 noted.
- Farmer/Landowner information: conversations and background data to supplement the square’s data.
- Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed categories for cliffs, rock types, peat, erosion, water bodies, ditches, springs, rivers, levees, and shorelines; separate inland/coastal codes for natural and artificial features.
- Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: extensive cover-type categories (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic and marsh vegetation, crops, fallow/abandoned land, etc.), with subcodes for species composition, abundance, and measurement units; livestock and production types recorded where possible.
- Forestry/Woodland/Trees: woodland types, tree/hedgerow structures, age, regeneration, planting, understorey, and management (unmanaged, natural regeneration, plantation, shelter, recreation, amenities), plus individual tree vs. group classifications.
- Boundaries: types (walls, fences, hedges, boundaries between land parcels), descriptions, gaps, and stockproof status; emphasis on accurately representing curtilages and urban-rural boundaries.
- Recreation: formal and informal recreation areas recorded to reflect land use and access.
- Buildings/Structures/Communications: built-cover types, uses, descriptions, and associated infrastructure (roads, tracks, footpaths, barriers, bridges, signage); color-coding guidance for mapping.
- Photography: five photographs per square with precise geolocation notes and directional orientation; front cover photo documented.
- Post-survey procedures: verification step to ensure no omissions; data may be transcribed onto maps only if necessary, but generally should remain in the original FAB format; batches submitted to Merlewood for processing.

## Outputs and data management
- Primary outputs are the Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and the annotated 6" maps for each square, supplemented by five slide photographs per square.
- Data are intended to be machine-readable and prepared for eventual sharing, discovery, and reuse with metadata, aligning with later data portal practices.
- The handbook emphasizes traceability of data sources and maintaining a clear record of how each observation was captured and coded.

## Documentation, standards, and reproducibility
- Detailed definitions and coding rules accompany each data category to ensure consistency across survey teams and over time.
- Guidelines accommodate atypical or doubtful cases with required qualifiers and notes.
- The approach supports future re-surveys by preserving a robust, standardized data framework that can be re-interpreted or re-coded as needed.

## Key challenges and considerations for data analysts
- The project addresses data at national scale with local detail, balancing comprehensiveness with practicality.
- The coding system enables complex, multi-factor descriptions but requires careful data entry and quality assurance in the field.
- Access to historical data and compatibility with prior surveys are important for longitudinal analyses.
- While the document focuses on field methods, analysts should be mindful of potential data gaps, changes in land use, and the need for consistent geospatial alignment across years.
- Data management and discoverability are highlighted, foreshadowing the importance of metadata, provenance tracking, and portable datasets for future analyses.
