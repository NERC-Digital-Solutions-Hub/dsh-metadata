# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIROMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview and Purpose
- Historical Field Survey Handbook (1984 May) for Project 424 ecological survey of Great Britain.
- Aimed to create a quality baseline by sampling 1x1 km squares across GB, using 1:10,000 maps to record land cover, habitat, and landscape features.
- Follow-up survey to visit original sites and assess changes over time; part of a program to compare ground survey with aerial photography.
- Defines guidelines to ensure consistent field recording, with allowances for atypical cases and the need to document uncertainties.

## Data Collection Framework and Scope
- Sampling design: 32 land classes; originally 256 squares surveyed (1977–78); additional sampling in 1984 expanded to 384 squares (2 or 15 km grids) across GB.
- Squares divided into seven groups; six ITE research stations plus liaison teams survey roving blocks.
- Each square assigned an estimated survey time; travel-based planning emphasized to optimize cost and scheduling.
- Practical considerations highlighted, such as avoiding double travel, and planning for different survey layouts (single-square daily travel, overnight stays, etc.).

## Data Recording and Coding Standards
- Field data captured on six-inch (1:10,000) maps annotated with a standardized set of codes, enabling multi-code combinations per feature.
- Data recorded in a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) alongside maps; each square generates a data package including series numbers and ownership notes.
- Core data sections (FAB sheets) include:
  - Ownership: establish ownership/tenancy for all parts of the square; use codes to indicate cooperation level of owners.
  - Farmer/Landowner Information: conversational data collected as background; not a formal questionnaire.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed codes for cliffs, rock features, peat, drainage, rivers, ponds, lakes, springs, and coastal features.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: ground-cover types (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, crops) with sub-codes for species mixtures, abundance, and management practices; curtilage rules apply for domestic areas.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: cover types for woodlands, coppice, scrub, hedgerows; tree measurements, age classes, species lists, regeneration, underplanting, and management status.
  - Boundaries: practical documentation of boundary types (walls, hedges, stockproof lines, gates, filled gaps, etc.) with descriptive qualifiers; focus on boundaries between urban and rural perimeters.
  - Recreation: formal and informal recreation areas; notes on access and usage.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types (residential, industrial, public services, education/cultural, religious, institutional), new developments, derelict sites, and infrastructure (pipeline, signs, roads, tracks, footpaths, embankments, bridges, etc.).
  - Photography: five slides per square, with precise geolocation and directional indicators on FAB.
- Coding conventions emphasize compact data encoding (boxes on forms to combine numeric codes into alpha representations) and clear differentiation of complex features (e.g., mosaic vegetation units, boundary demarcation with perpendicular marks).
- Colour conventions suggested to simplify field-to-map translation when coding is complex.

## Post-Survey Procedures and Data Handling
- End-of-survey checks recommended to ensure no features are omitted; transcription to new sheets is discouraged unless absolutely necessary.
- Completed FABs should be reported to Merlewood (the central coordination point) and batches arranged for transport/prioritized processing.
- Emphasis on maintaining provenance and consistency across updates; data archiving practices reflect the need for traceability.

## Particular Data Governance Considerations for Data Stewards
- Data provenance and lineage: explicit dating of surveys, ownership and tenancy details, and the sequence of data collection steps.
- Metadata and standardization: a comprehensive dictionary of codes (ownership, physiography, vegetation, soils, boundaries, buildings, etc.) to support harmonization with other datasets and future re-use.
- Data quality and consistency: reliance on field judgment with explicit qualifiers, and the use of coded combinations to minimize ambiguity; instructions to document uncertainties and changes observed.
- Access, permissions, and updates: explicit permissions necessary before surveying; ownership information collected to facilitate future follow-up and repeat surveys.
- Data sharing and interoperability: FAB data intended for cataloging and eventual integration with broader data portals; color-coding and standardized sheets support potential digitization and GIS integration.
- Practical governance challenges: incomplete understanding of user needs, timely data acquisition, heterogeneous data systems and formats, large dataset handling, and legacy/non-interoperable databases.

## End-to-End Workflow (Planning to Post-Survey)
- Planning and equipment: organize teams; prepare FABs, maps, films, and field materials; account for travel efficiency.
- Field procedure: secure permissions, select routes, cover entire squares, and record data with codes; engage at least one farmer for contextual information.
- Data recording: annotate maps with numeric codes; maintain square integrity and ensure edge corners are recorded; use mosaic and color coding where necessary.
- Substantial data items covered: ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland water/coastal features, land cover and vegetation, forestry, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications.
- Photography: capture five targeted views per square with precise geolocation and direction.
- Post-survey: verify data completeness, avoid unnecessary transcription, and report batches to Merlewood for processing and storage.
