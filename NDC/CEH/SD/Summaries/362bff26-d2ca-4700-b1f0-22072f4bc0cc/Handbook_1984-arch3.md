# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview and Purpose
- Describes a standardized field survey program (1984) for rural Britain, building on the 1976 Ecological Survey of Great Britain (Project 424).
- Uses a grid-based approach (1:10,000 maps) with 384 squares surveyed in 1984 (12 from each of 32 land classes) to establish a quality baseline for future monitoring and assess changes both on the ground and by aerial photography.
- Aims to capture land cover, habitat, soils, landscape features, and land use in a way that is practical, compatible with prior surveys, and relevant to grid-based analysis.

## Planning and Field Procedure
- Sampling is organized into seven groups of squares, with teams from six ITE research stations and liaison from Merlewood.
- Each square is planned as an approximately one-day survey, with travel-time considerations driving scheduling and cost assumptions (no overnight subsistence in base costs).
- Three planning approaches are described for arranging surveys (daily travel, one-night stays, or a few days with grouped squares).
- Emphasizes permissions, access, and good relations with landowners to ensure full square coverage and minimize wasted effort.

## Equipment
- Minimal, map-recording oriented rather than measurement-heavy.
- Includes FAB data recording booklets, 6" (1:10,000) maps, films, color pens, navigation tools, ITE identity cards, clipboards, pencils, weatherproof clothing, reference books, and a camera.

## Suggested Field Procedure
- On arrival: assess access, potential problems, and acquaint with the area.
- Secure permissions for the whole square before recording.
- Choose a route that allows full coverage of the square.
- After surveying, review records for omissions and ensure clear presentation; time is built in for checking completeness.

## Permissions
- Securing access is essential for legal and goodwill reasons; enables comprehensive surveying and background data collection.
- Experience suggests permissions can generally be obtained, though delays can occur with prior contacts or communications.
- Surveyors carry identification and maintain ownership/tenant information; a farmer contact is encouraged to gain contextual information.

## Data Recording (FAB: Field Assessment Booklet)
- The survey is primarily a map-annotation exercise on 6" maps, using a predefined list of data codes to format information.
- Codes are combined in boxes on data sheets to represent complex features efficiently; an example shows how boundary and vegetation attributes can be encoded in a single record.
- Boundaries must be clearly marked on maps and all map units are treated as mapable if they meet minimum size criteria.
- Field decisions should be made in real time by the surveyor; deferred or unclear decisions should be documented with qualifying notes.

## Filling in the FAB (Field Assessment Booklet)
- Each square is documented with a sequence of pages forming the FAB, including:
  - Cover and series number, location, and ownership information.
  - Ownership and tenant/landlord status, with a coded assessment of owner cooperativeness.
  - Farmer/Landowner Information: conversational notes to capture background context (with guidance to keep it unobtrusive).
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed classification of cliffs, rocks, peat, erosion features, ditches, springs, lakes, rivers, canals, and related hydrological features.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: extensive cover-type categories (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, crops, fallow/abandoned land), species lists, and vegetation proportions; includes height classes and management/use notes.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: classification of woodland units, tree and shrub categories, species lists, age, regeneration, planting, and management status (e.g., unmanaged, underplanting, plantations, coppice).
  - Boundaries: types (e.g., mortared walls, hedges, fences) and accompanying descriptions; multiple boundary types can be recorded for a given unit.
  - Recreation: formal and informal recreation areas or uses.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built-cover types, description of structures, use, and associated infrastructure (roads, tracks, footpaths, fences, signs, pipelines).
  - Colour conventions: a color-coding system is provided to simplify map coding for different land-use categories and built features.
  - Photographs: five photographs per square, with precise location and view directions recorded on the FAB front pages.
- The FAB is designed to accommodate typical field situations while allowing for atypical or complex sites through qualifiers and notes.

## Photography
- Five slide photographs per square reflecting diverse viewpoints while avoiding excessive sky and expansive surrounding areas.
- Exact photographic locations and directions are recorded on the FAB to link images with map features.

## Procedure Subsequent to Survey
- After fieldwork, review sheets to ensure no features were omitted.
- Transposing data onto new maps is discouraged unless necessary; where unavoidable, it should be done carefully to avoid damaging original maps.
- Batch submission: inform Merlewood as squares are completed and arrange transport of FABs for processing.

## Data Coding and Standards (Key Concepts for Monitoring Framework Authors)
- The handbook demonstrates a comprehensive, predefined coding scheme for consistent data capture across sites and over time.
- Uses a combination of numeric codes and color/description codes to encode complex landscape, vegetation, and infrastructure information onto maps and FABs.
- Emphasizes metadata-like practices in the field (ownership, permissions, interview context, and edge conditions) to support data provenance and interpretability.
- Enables aggregation and comparison across squares and time, supporting baseline establishment and change detection.

## Practical Considerations and Challenges (From the Handbook Perspective)
- The approach requires rigorous permissions, standardized field procedures, and disciplined data recording to avoid gaps.
- Complex mosaics and multi-layered land-use patterns necessitate careful coding and occasional qualitative notes.
- Data management relies on disciplined post-survey workflow, batch submissions, and consistent use of the FAB and associated maps.

## Relevance for Authors of Monitoring Frameworks
- Provides a concrete model of how to operationalize environmental health measures in the field with:
  - A clear planning and sampling framework.
  - A minimal but robust equipment set focused on data collection.
  - A detailed, standardized data collection instrument (FAB) with extensive coding for land cover, vegetation, hydrology, land use, and infrastructure.
  - Explicit procedures for permissions, data quality, and data provenance.
  - An integrated photography component tied to spatial record-keeping.
- Demonstrates the importance of metadata, governance, and interoperability considerations that align with modern monitoring framework practices: standardization, openness of data concepts, and reproducibility across time and space.
