# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Framework for the field survey component of Countryside Survey to monitor environmental features across Great Britain.
  - Built to be compatible with and explain the evolution of the ITE Land Classification, ensuring time-series continuity for detecting change.
  - Aimed at informing policy, informing decisions, and supporting environmental monitoring dashboards and reports.

- Core approach and monitoring framework
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of different land types.
  - Units of sampling are 1 km squares classified by the ITE Land Classification, with stratification by land type to reduce bias and increase precision.
  - Stratification reduces risk that random samples are non-representative of the wider landscape.

- Land Classification as the backbone
  - ITE Land Classification developed to group land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
  - Used to map GB into classes that guide sampling (initially 32 classes; later expanded to reflect policy needs and Wales/Scotland reporting).
  - The classification evolved across surveys to accommodate country-specific reporting and finer resolution in some regions.

- Sampling history and progression
  - 1978 (Initial Survey)
    - 32 ITE Land Classes derived from 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid).
    - 8 sample squares per class (256 total) to derive national habitat areas; estimates based on mean habitat area per square within each class multiplied by the class area.
  - 1984 (Second GB Survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); eight squares from 1978 were retained for continuity.
  - 1990 (CS1990; All Squares Land Classification)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Repeats of earlier quadrats; integration with first Land Cover Map of GB.
    - National estimates recalculated using the new all-squares classification; adjustments made for policy-driven needs.
  - 2000 (CS2000; Developments in Land Classification)
    - Land Classification extended to provide reliable England, Scotland, and Wales country estimates.
    - Sub-division and aggregation of classes created 40 strata to support country-specific reporting.
    - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland habitats included via an uplands module in subsequent planning.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Welsh and England adaptations)
    - Wales-specific reporting requirements prompted further class sub-divisions into country-unit versions (creating new classes such as 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares added (minimum 6 per Welsh class).
    - England, in some classes, retained 4 squares due to resource constraints; Wales received more intensive sampling to support Wales-only estimates.
    - An upland module continued to support more robust statistics for upland habitats.

- Country-specific adaptations and reporting
  - Separate country estimates introduced to provide England with Wales, England with Scotland, and Scotland-only reporting contexts.
  - England, Wales, and Scotland each have tailored class structures and sampling allocations to reflect country-specific policy and reporting needs.
  - Isle of Man entries removed from national country estimates and replaced with additional GB samples in England to maintain consistency.

- Uplands module and additional sampling
  - CS2000 included an uplands-focused module adding 30 squares in upland/marginal upland areas.
  - This enhanced statistical precision for habitat estimates in upland regions within England and Wales.

- Data products, outputs, and governance
  - Outputs include land classification maps, sample maps, and various reports detailing habitat extent and change.
  - The framework supports longitudinal analysis by maintaining documented changes in classification and sampling design across surveys.
  - Notes on consistency: when adopting newer land classifications, national estimates can be affected; the approach prioritizes consistency within a survey using the latest classification, while cross-survey comparability may be improved by referencing the original classification.

- Summary of impact for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates how a monitored environment can be assessed through a structured, stratified sampling design tightly integrated with a flexible, evolving classification framework.
  - Balances the need for detailed, country-specific reporting with the necessity of coherent time-series data.
  - Provides a transparent methodological trail from initial sampling to contemporary, policy-relevant outputs, highlighting the importance of documentation for reproducibility and governance in monitoring programs.
