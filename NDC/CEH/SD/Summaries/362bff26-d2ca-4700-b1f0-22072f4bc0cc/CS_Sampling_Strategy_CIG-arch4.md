# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the sampling strategy and the evolution of the ITE (Institute of Terrestrial Ecology) Land Classification as the framework for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
  - Emphasizes that the current methodology is built on three decades of time-series data and is designed to be consistent with predecessors while enabling change detection.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified sampling to ensure representative coverage and reduce bias in national estimates.
  - Use of the ITE Land Classification to partition Great Britain into land classes with similar environmental characteristics.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used historically to form the initial land classes, with environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) guiding classification.

- Timeline of development
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
    - 32 Land Classes derived from 1228 central 1 km squares (with surrounding squares classified using ISA framework).
    - 256 field squares surveyed (8 per class); national habitat area estimates based on class proportions and square counts.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Expanded sampling to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Countryside Survey 1990)
    - Land Classification updated to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked with the first Land Cover Map of GB; repeat of earlier quadrat data.
    - Results published in CS1990 main report; national estimates recalculated using the updated framework.
  - 1998–2000 (Revised Land Classification and CS2000)
    - Land Classification revised to support separate Scotland reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
    - Need to produce separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) led to class subdivision, aggregation, and additional sample squares (total GB sample ~57x per class distribution changes).
    - Introduction of separate country unit estimates and upland habitat module considerations to improve accuracy for England, Wales, and Scotland.
  - 2007 (Revised Land Classification and CS2007)
    - Welsh-only reporting requirements prompted further Wales-specific sub-divisions (creating new classes such as 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an expanded Wales sample (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class; 43 extra squares for Wales).
    - England adjustments followed to maintain comparability, with some classes remaining at a lower sample count.
    - Wales gains emphasis for country-specific environmental policy and legislation reporting.

- Data structure and outputs
  - Land Classes (evolving from 32 to 40–45 with country-specific subdivisions)
  - Sample squares and strata
    - 1978: 256 squares across 32 classes
    - 1984: 384 squares across 32 classes
    - 1990: 508 squares with all GB squares classified
    - 2000: expanded framework for England, Wales, Scotland; 40 strata
    - 2007: 45 strata (with Wales-specific subdivisions), expanded Welsh squares
  - National estimates approach
    - Estimates of habitat areas derived from the mean habitat area per square in each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - Regional and country reporting
    - Introduction of country-unit estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) to align with devolved policy needs.
    - Separate country maps and adjusted sampling to reflect country-specific classifications.

- Key outputs and references
  - CS1978–CS2007 field surveys underpin time-series habitat/change estimates.
  - Figures and tables (e.g., maps of original/new Land Classes; sample square distributions; Table 3 summaries) illustrate sampling framework and the distribution of squares across classes and years.
  - Acknowledgements and references document methodological guidance and statistical considerations for Wales-only reporting and cross-country consistency.

- Practical implications for data governance
  - Classification changes affect the comparability of national estimates across survey years; a balance is required between methodological updates and the need for consistent time-series data.
  - Country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) necessitates sub-dividing classes and adjusting sample allocations to maintain precision within each country.
  - The strategy emphasizes data discoverability and metadata through explicit mappings of Land Classes to geographic areas and temporal changes, supporting long-term data usability.
