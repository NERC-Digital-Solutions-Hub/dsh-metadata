# Metadata for 'Long-term multisite Scots pine trial, Scotland: mother tree, cone and seed phenotypes, 2007'

- Overview
  - Reports phenotypes of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) mother trees and their cones/seeds from 21 native populations across Scotland.
  - Seed used to establish a long-term multisite common garden trial at three nurseries/field sites.
  - Sampling targeted diverse populations to represent Scotland’s native range, including three populations from each of seven seed zones.

- Sampling design and collection
  - Ten seed trees sampled per population in March 2007.
  - Central sampling location with a circular around it (~1 km in diameter).
  - Spatial protocol: nine points in predetermined random directions, with distance stratified in a 1:3:5 ratio to avoid central over-sampling.
  - For smaller woodlands or where cones were scarce, directions preserved to ensure broad coverage, with inter-tree distances never closer than 50 m.

- Measurements on mother trees (maternal effects control)
  - All mother trees had height and diameter at breast height (DBH) measured.
  - Ten cones collected per mother tree and assessed in detail.
  - Cone traits measured before drying: width and length.
  - Cone weight measured after drying.
  - Seed traits: total seed weight per cone and count and percentage of viable seeds (viable = winged and visibly seed-bearing).
  - Mean values computed for each mother tree across its 10 cones.

- Data files and structure
  - Two datasets:
    - ConeSeedTraits.txt
    - MotherTraits.txt

- Key variables and metadata
  - PopulationCode: population identifier.
  - Family: mother-tree identifier (records share a family code per mother tree).
  - Population: full population name.
  - SeedZone: Scots pine seed zone (EC, N, NC, NE, NW, SC, SW).
  - Latitude/Longitude: geographic coordinates for population.
  - Aspect, Slope, Altitude: geographic and topographic context (described with specific unit conventions).
  - Regeneration, SoilDepth, SoilMoisture, Competition, HA (Height of mother tree), DA (Diameter at breast height) and related descriptors with defined scales and units.
  - ConeSeedTraits.txt includes: Cone (number of cone measured per population), Wi (width in mm), Le (length in mm), We (weight of cone in g), SN (total viable seeds per cone, count), SV (viable seed percentage, %), SW (weight of viable seeds per cone in g).

- Specific trait definitions (ConeSeedTraits and related)
  - SN: Total number of viable seeds in a cone (count).
  - SV: Percentage of viable seeds in a cone (%).
  - SW: Weight of all viable seeds in a single cone (g).
  - Wi: Width of cone (mm).
  - Le: Length of cone (mm).
  - We: Weight of cone (g).

- Purpose and potential uses
  - Enables assessment of genetic and phenotypic variation across Scottish populations.
  - Supports long-term monitoring through a standardised, quality-controlled dataset.
  - Facilitates analyses of maternal effects, cone/seed traits, and their relation to geographic and environmental context.
  - Designed to be compatible with data portals for broader access and integration with other environmental datasets.

- Data quality and monitoring context
  - Data collection follows a standardised sampling protocol with careful documentation of locations and trait measurements.
  - Traits are measured to enable comparison across populations and over time, consistent with monitoring and reporting practices for environmental health and policy performance.
