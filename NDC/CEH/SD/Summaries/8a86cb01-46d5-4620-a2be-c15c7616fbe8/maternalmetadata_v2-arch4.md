# Metadata for 'Long-term multisite Scots pine trial, Scotland: mother tree, cone and seed phenotypes, 2007'

- The dataset captures phenotypes of Scots pine mother trees and their cones/seeds from 21 native populations across Scotland.
- Seed from these trees was used to establish a long-term multisite common garden trial at three nurseries/field sites.
- Sampling design:
  - Ten seed trees per population sampled March 2007, covering a circle of ~1 km diameter around a central tree.
  - Spatial protocol: nine points in predetermined random directions, with a 1:3:5 distance ratio to stratify sampling.
  - For smaller woodland fragments or few cone-bearing trees, directions retained to ensure broad coverage; minimum distance between sampled trees never < 50 m.
- Measurements on mother trees (to control for maternal effects) included:
  - Height and diameter at breast height (DBH).
  - Ten cones collected per mother tree and analyzed (cone width/length before drying; cone weight after drying).
  - From each cone: total seed weight, count of viable seeds (viable = wings present and obvious seed).
  - Mean values computed per mother tree across the 10 cones.
- Dataset composition:
  - Two files: ConeSeedTraits.txt and MotherTraits.txt.
  - PopulationCode: short code for population; Population: full population name; SeedZone: Scots pine seed zone (EC, N, NC, NE, NW, SC, SW).
  - Geography: Latitude and Longitude of populations; additional location attributes.
  - MotherTraits.txt includes: Family (mother tree ID), Population, Latitude/Longitude, Aspect, Slope, Altitude, Regeneration, SoilDepth, SoilMoisture, Competition, Height (HA), Diameter at breast height (DA).
  - ConeSeedTraits.txt includes: Cone, Width (Wi), Length (Le), Weight (We); Viable Seeds per Cone (SN); Percentage Viable (SV); Weight of viable seeds per cone (SW).
- Units and data standards:
  - Measurements in millimeters (mm), grams (g), counts, and percentages where applicable.
  - Living descriptions include categorical/ordinal codes (e.g., SeedZone, Slope categories, Regeneration levels).
  - Decimal fields for geographic and measured attributes; specific mappings described (e.g., Slope: flat to steep; Altitude: M).
- Temporal and location context:
  - Cone collection conducted in March 2007 at James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen (lat 57.133214, lon -2.158764).
- Purpose and use:
  - Designed to enable analysis of maternal effects, cone/seed traits, and their variation across populations.
  - Supports a long-term multisite trial to study data across different environments and populations.
- Data governance considerations:
  - Metadata provides explicit column headers, descriptions, and units to support discoverability and interoperability.
  - Coding schemes (PopulationCode, SeedZone) facilitate cross-dataset integration and aggregation.
