# Radiocarbon measurements on river wood deposits, Mackenzie River, Canada

## Aim
- Constrain the source and age of large wood carried by the Mackenzie River and entering the Arctic Ocean.
- Achieve robust spatial coverage across multiple depositional environments in the Mackenzie River delta region.

## Methods: collection and sampling
- 42 wood deposits visited in August 2019; sites chosen for accessibility and environmental diversity (lake shores, coastal embayments, inland floodplains, riverbanks).
- At each site, up to three large wood samples collected for radiocarbon analysis.
- Outer wood (2–5 cm) extracted from bark-less large wood pieces using an axe (weathering limited subsampling), to constrain the age of the earliest growth rings.

## Data recorded (nature and units)
For each sample, the following were documented:
- Sample identifier, radiocarbon publication code and measurement batch
- Latitude/Longitude (decimal degrees)
- Region/site descriptor
- Wood diameter (cm) and length (m)
- Carbon content of extracted cellulose (weight %)
- Stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C, VPDB, ‰)
- Radiocarbon activity: Percent Modern (pMC) and 1σ uncertainty; Fraction Modern (F14C) and 1σ
- Radiocarbon age (years) and 1σ uncertainty
- Upper and lower calibrated wood age (2σ) with 95% confidence range, using OxCal 4.4
  - IntCal20 for samples with F14C < 1; Bomb21NH1 for F14C > 1
- Sample type (large log, small pieces, buried, river cut bank)
- Cover type (vegetation at sample site)
- Depositional landform and environment

## Quality control
- Full adherence to NEIF Radiocarbon Facility QC: blanks and analytical standards processed
- Analytical uncertainties reported at the 1σ level

## Data structure
- CSV file with 77 rows of data, columns labeled A to Y

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Focus on Large Wood carried by rivers in the Mackenzie River delta, Northwest Territories, Canada
- Systematic sampling aimed at broad environmental coverage, spanning longitudes 132W–135W and latitudes 67N–69N
- Objective: robustly constrain wood sources and ages within the riverine system feeding the Arctic Ocean

## Analytical methods (cellulose extraction and radiocarbon analysis)
- Stepwise chemical pretreatment to isolate cellulose:
  - Digestion in 4M HCl (80°C, 8 h)
  - Removal of mineral acids, digestion in 2M KOH (80°C, 2 h) with repeated deionised water washing
  - Additional HCl digestions, washing, and drying
  - Oxidation to cellulose using acidified sodium chlorite (NaClO2) until white cellulose precipitate forms
  - Filtration, acid-free washing, drying
- Combustion to CO2, conversion to graphite via Fe/Zn reduction
- Radiocarbon activity measured by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at SUERC
  - Results reported as conventional radiocarbon years BP (relative to AD 1950) and Fraction Modern (F14C) with 1σ uncertainties
  - δ13C corrected to VPDB = −25‰ using dual-inlet mass spectrometry
- All results calibrated to calendar years using OxCal 4.4

## Interpretation and data usage
- Measured conventional 14C ages and F14C values used to model calendar ages with OxCal 4.4
- Calibrated age ranges provided as 2σ (95% confidence)
