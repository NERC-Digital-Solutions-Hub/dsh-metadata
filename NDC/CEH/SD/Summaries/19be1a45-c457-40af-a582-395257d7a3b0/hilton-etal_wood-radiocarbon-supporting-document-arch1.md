# Radiocarbon measurements on river wood deposits, Mackenzie River, Canada

- Purpose: Collect and analyze radiocarbon data from large wood carried by rivers to help constrain the source and age of wood in the Mackenzie River delta, draining to the Arctic Ocean.

## Study design and sampling

- Fieldwork: 42 wood deposits visited in August 2019 across multiple depositional environments (lake shores, coastal embayments, inland floodplains, riverbanks).
- Sample collection: Up to three large wood samples per site; outermost wood (2–5 cm) harvested with an axe due to weathering, to constrain the age of earliest growth rings.
- Targeted coverage: Spatial sampling across longitudes 132W–135W and latitudes 67N–69N to ensure robust geographic representation.

## Data collected and recorded (per sample)

- Sample identifiers and measurement batch codes.
- Location data: latitude and longitude (decimal degrees); descriptor of region and site.
- Wood characteristics: diameter (cm), length (m), carbon content of extracted cellulose (weight %).
- Isotopic and radiocarbon measurements: stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C, VPDB, ‰); Percent Modern radiocarbon activity and 1σ uncertainty; Fraction Modern radiocarbon activity and 1σ uncertainty.
- Dating results: radiocarbon age (years) and 1σ uncertainty; upper and lower calibrated wood ages (2σ), with OxCal 4.4 modeling; calibration curves used (IntCal20 for F14C<1; Bomb21NH1 for F14C>1).
- Sample metadata: sample type (e.g., large log, small pieces, buried, river cut bank); cover type at site; depositional landform; depositional environment.

## Quality control

- Full adherence to NEIF Radiocarbon Facility QC: blanks and analytical standards processed; reported analytical uncertainties are 1σ.

## Data structure and accessibility

- Data stored in a .csv file with 77 rows (samples) and columns labeled A–Y (25 columns across).
- Dataset format supports replication and re-analysis, with linked metadata (location, wood characteristics, isotopic measurements, and calibrated ages).

## Analytical methods

- Cellulose extraction: sequential chemical treatments (HCl, KOH, oxidation with acidified sodium chlorite) to isolate cellulose from wood samples.
- Graphite target preparation: conversion of purified cellulose carbon to CO2, then to graphite for AMS.
- Radiocarbon measurement: Accelerator Mass Spectrometry at SUERC; results reported as conventional radiocarbon years BP (relative to AD 1950) and Fraction Modern (F14C) with 1σ uncertainties.
- Isotopic correction: δ13C values corrected to VPDB = -25‰ using dual-inlet stable isotope mass spectrometry.

## Dating interpretation and calibration

- Calendar ages derived using OxCal v4.4, with reported 95% confidence intervals for lower and upper bounds.
- Calibration context: IntCal20 used for samples with F14C < 1; Bomb21NH1 used for samples with F14C > 1.
- Output types: calibrated wood ages in calendar years AD, informed by measured conventional radiocarbon ages and F14C values.

## Context and publication

- Full discussion of data and interpretation available in the publication: Sendrowski et al., 2023, Geophysical Research Letters — Wood-Based Carbon Storage in the Mackenzie River Delta: The World's Largest Mapped Riverine Wood Deposit.
- Data and methods are designed to support understanding of wood sources, transport, and temporal dynamics within a large Arctic river system.
