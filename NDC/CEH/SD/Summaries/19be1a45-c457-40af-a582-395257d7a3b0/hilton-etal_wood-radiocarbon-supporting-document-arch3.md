# Radiocarbon measurements on river wood deposits, Mackenzie River, Canada

## Purpose and scope
- Objective: constrain the source and age of wood carried by the Mackenzie River delta, supporting understanding of riverine wood deposition and Arctic carbon dynamics.
- Study design: 42 wood deposits sampled in August 2019 across multiple depositional environments (lake shores, coastal embayments, inland floodplains, riverbanks) to achieve broad spatial and environmental coverage.

## Collection and sampling methods
- At each site, up to three Large Wood (LW) samples collected for radiocarbon analysis.
- Due to wood weathering, outermost wood (2–5 cm) was removed with an axe from bark-free LW pieces to constrain the earliest growth rings.
  
## Data captured and units
- For each sample:
  - Sample identifier, measurement publication code, and measurement batch.
  - Latitude/Longitude (decimal degrees); region and site name.
  - Wood diameter (cm) and length (m).
  - Carbon content of extracted cellulose (weight %).
  - Stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C, VPDB, ‰).
  - Percent Modern radiocarbon activity (pMC) and 1σ uncertainty; Fraction Modern radiocarbon activity (F14C) and 1σ uncertainty.
  - Radiocarbon age (years) and 1σ uncertainty.
  - Calibrated wood age: upper and lower bounds (2σ, AD year), derived from OxCal 4.4. Calibration curves:
    - F14C < 1: IntCal20
    - F14C > 1: Bomb21NH1
  - Sample type (e.g., large log, small pieces, buried, river cut bank); cover type; depositional landform; depositional environment.

## Quality control and data integrity
- Quality control at the NEIF Radiocarbon Facility: blanks and analytical standards processed; uncertainties reported at 1σ.
- Data structure: .csv with 77 rows, columns A–Y.
- All radiocarbon results are reported as conventional radiocarbon years BP (relative to AD 1950) and F14C, corrected for δ13C (−25‰) using stable isotope measurements.

## Analytical methods
- Chemical pretreatment to isolate cellulose:
  - Digestion in 4M HCl (80°C, 8 h), rinse, digest in 2M KOH (80°C, 2 h); repeats to remove humics.
  - Acid wash, digestion in 2M HCl (80°C, 5 h), rinse, then oxidize to cellulose with acidified sodium chlorite until white precipitate forms.
  - Filtration, acid-free washing, drying, and homogenization.
- Radiocarbon analysis: cellulose combustion to CO2, graphite formation (Fe/Zn reduction), AMS measurement at SUERC; results reported as conventional years BP and F14C, 1σ.
- δ13C correction performed in all measurements.

## Data interpretation and usage
- Radiocarbon ages modeled in OxCal 4.4 to obtain calendar-year estimates.
- The dataset supports interpretation of wood age, deposition timing, and riverine wood transport within the Mackenzie River delta system.
- Publication context: data and interpretations discussed in Sendrowski et al., 2023 (Wood-Based Carbon Storage in the Mackenzie River Delta: The World's Largest Mapped Riverine Wood Deposit, Geophysical Research Letters).

## Accessibility and provenance
- Primary data and methods are described, with a CSV dataset available containing detailed metadata for each sample.
