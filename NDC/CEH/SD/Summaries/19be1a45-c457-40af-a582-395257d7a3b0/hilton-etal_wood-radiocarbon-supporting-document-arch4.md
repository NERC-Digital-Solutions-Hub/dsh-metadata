# Radiocarbon measurements on river wood deposits, Mackenzie River, Canada

- Study visits and scope: 42 wood deposits were visited in August 2019 across multiple depositional environments (lake shores, coastal embayments, inland floodplains, riverbanks) to constrain the source and age of wood carried by the Mackenzie River delta draining to the Arctic Ocean.
- Sampling approach: At each site, up to three samples of large wood were collected. Outer wood (approx. 2–5 cm) was recovered from large logs using an axe (no bark) to constrain the age of earliest growth rings due to weathering and sampling practicality.
- Geographic coverage: Samples span longitudes 132W–135W and latitudes 67N–69N, providing broad spatial coverage of the river delta.

## Data collection and content

- Data collection purpose: Radiocarbon analysis to date riverine wood and understand wood transport dynamics in the Mackenzie River system.
- Measurement and facility: Radiocarbon activity measured at NEIF Radiocarbon Facility; cellulose extracted and converted to graphite for AMS measurement at SUERC.
- Recorded metadata for each sample:
  - Sample identifier and measurement/publication batch codes
  - Latitude and longitude (decimal degrees)
  - Region/site descriptor
  - Wood diameter (cm) and length (m)
  - Carbon content of extracted cellulose (wt%)
  - Stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C, VPDB, in ‰)
  - Percent Modern (pMC) and Fraction Modern (F14C) radiocarbon activity with 1σ uncertainties
  - Radiocarbon age (yr BP) with 1σ uncertainty
  - Upper and lower calibrated wood ages (AD, 2σ) using OxCal 4.4; calibration curves: IntCal20 for F14C < 1, Bomb14NH1 for F14C > 1
  - Sample type (e.g., large log, small pieces, buried, river cut bank)
  - Cover type at sample site
  - Depositional landform and environment descriptions

## Quality control and analytical methods

- Quality control: Full adherence to NEIF Radiocarbon Facility QC procedures, including blanks and analytical standards; uncertainties reported at 1σ.
- Sample preparation workflow: 
  - Digestion in 4M HCl at 80°C (8 h)
  - Washing and subsequent digestion in 2M KOH (80°C, 2 h); repeat to remove humics
  - Final digestion and drying; oxidation to cellulose with acidified sodium chlorite (NaClO2 + HCl) until white cellulose precipitate formed
  - Filtration, washing, drying, and homogenisation
- Chemical processing and measurement: Total carbon in pretreated sample recovered as CO2 by combustion with CuO; CO2 reduced to graphite via Fe/Zn, then AMS measurement
- Isotopic corrections: δ13C values corrected to δ13CVPDB = -25‰ using dual-inlet stable isotope mass spectrometry

## Data structure and accessibility

- Data format: A CSV file with 77 rows and 25 columns (columns A–Y)
- Documentation scope: Metadata captured to support reproducibility, data provenance, and future reuse
- Link to interpretation: All radiocarbon dates modeled in OxCal 4.4 to provide calendar-age ranges

## Experimental design and analysis

- Design rationale: Systematic sampling across multiple depositional environments to achieve robust spatial coverage and constrain wood source and transport pathways in the Mackenzie River delta
- Analytical modeling: Radiocarbon dates modeled in OxCal 4.4; calendar age ranges derived for each sample (2σ)
- Calibration approach: 
  - Use IntCal20 for samples with F14C < 1
  - Use Bomb14NH1 calibration curve for samples with F14C > 1
- Associated publication: Data discussed in Sendrowski et al., 2023, Wood-Based Carbon Storage in the Mackenzie River Delta: The World's Largest Mapped Riverine Wood Deposit, Geophysical Research Letters

## Provisions for data usage and provenance

- Purpose of data: Constraining sources and ages of wood in the Mackenzie River, contributing to understanding carbon storage and riverine wood dynamics
- Provenance and lineage: Raw radiocarbon measurements, calibration, and OxCal modeling explicitly documented; measurements performed at NEIF and SUERC; results tied to published study for broader interpretability
- Reuse considerations: Rich metadata enable cross-site comparisons and integration with broader riverine wood and carbon storage datasets; dataset supports methodological transparency for similar radiocarbon studies in fluvial systems
