# Radiocarbon measurements on river wood deposits, Mackenzie River, Canada

## Overview
- Study to constrain source and age of wood carried by the Mackenzie River, draining to the Arctic Ocean.
- Fieldwork in August 2019; 42 wood deposits visited across multiple depositional environments.
- Up to three large wood samples collected per site; outermost wood (2–5 cm) sampled with an axe due to weathering, to constrain earliest growth-ring ages.

## Data collection and sampling methods
- Sites chosen for accessibility and environmental diversity: lake shores, coastal embayments, inland floodplains, riverbanks.
- Samples represent Large Wood (LW) carried by rivers; targeted broad spatial coverage with coordinates spanning 132W–135W and 67N–69N.

## Data content and units
For each sample, recorded fields include:
- Sample identifier, measurement publication code, and measurement batch
- Latitude and Longitude (decimal degrees)
- Location descriptors: Region and site name
- Wood diameter (cm) and wood length (m)
- Carbon content of extracted cellulose (weight %)
- Stable carbon isotope composition, δ13C (VPDB, ‰)
- Percent Modern radiocarbon activity (pMC) and 1σ uncertainty
- Fraction Modern radiocarbon activity (F14C) and 1σ uncertainty
- Radiocarbon age (years BP) and 1σ uncertainty
- Upper and lower calibrated wood age (2σ) with OxCal 4.4; Calibrations use IntCal20 for F14C<1 and Bomb21NH1 for F14C>1
- Sample type (e.g., large log, small pieces, buried, river cut bank)
- Cover type, deposition landform, and depositional environment

## Quality control
- Full quality control at the NEIF Radiocarbon Facility, including blanks and analytical standards with known activity.
- Reported analytical uncertainties at 1σ.

## Data structure
- Data stored in a .csv file with 77 rows and columns labeled A to Y (25 columns).

## Experimental design
- Systematic sampling of LW in the Mackenzie River delta region (Northwest Territories, Canada) to robustly constrain wood source and age.
- Geographic coverage designed to span multiple depositional environments and broad spatial range.

## Analytical methods
- Cellulose extraction: sequential chemical treatments
  - 4M HCl (80°C, 8 h)
  - 2M KOH (80°C, 2 h) with repeated washing to remove humics
  - 2M HCl (80°C, 5 h)
  - De-humified sample digested in acidified NaClO2 (70°C) until cellulose formed
- Filtration and drying of cellulose
- Combustion to CO2, carbon recovered, graphite produced via Fe/Zn reduction
- AMS radiocarbon measurement at SUERC
- Results: conventional radiocarbon years BP (relative to AD 1950) and F14C, with ~1σ uncertainties
- δ13C corrections to -25‰ using dual-inlet stable isotope mass spectrometry

## Data interpretation and calibration
- Radiocarbon ages modeled in OxCal v4.4
- Calibrated wood ages reported as 2σ ranges (95% confidence)
- Calibration curves: IntCal20 for F14C<1; Bomb21NH1 for F14C>1
