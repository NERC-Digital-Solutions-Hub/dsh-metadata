## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Location: meteorological station on top of a boat house in Cumbria, England, next to Esthwaite Water.
- Measured variables: air temperature (degrees C) and wind speed (m/s).
- Data cadence: measurements every 4 minutes; hourly averages calculated by a Campbell Scientific datalogger.
- Hourly average definition: the value for a given hour reflects the data from the previous hour, e.g., the 2 p.m. value is the average of data from 1 to 2 p.m., excluding 1 p.m. data and including 2 p.m. data.

- Visual checks performed; obvious hardware malfunctions removed.
- Data gaps arise from maintenance work or sensor/logger problems.

## Data structure
- Format: comma separated values (CSV).
- Columns: Date_GMT (Date and time in GMT of measurement), Air_Temperature (°C), Wind_Speed (m/s).
- Note: data from this station are used in several current scientific studies, including those by PhD students.
