# Data from a meteorological station next to Esthwaite Water 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011

## Overview
- Location: meteorological station on top of a boat house in Cumbria, England, next to Esthwaite Water.
- Period: 2008–2011.
- Variables: air temperature (degrees C) and wind speed (m/s).
- Measurement cadence: data every 4 minutes; hourly averages calculated by a Campbell Scientific datalogger.
- Time reference: all data in GMT.

## Data collection and regime
- Instruments measure air temperature and wind speed from a range of meteorological sensors.
- Hourly average for a given hour is computed from data within that hour, excluding the data at the start of the interval and including the data at the end (e.g., 2 p.m. value = average of 1–2 p.m. data, excluding 1 p.m., including 2 p.m.).

## Quality control and data status
- Data are raw and have not yet been calibrated or quality controlled.
- Visual checks performed; obvious hardware-related errors removed.
- Gaps occur due to maintenance or sensor/logger problems.

## Data structure and format
- Format: comma-separated values (CSV).
- Columns:
  - Date_GMT: Date and time (GMT) of measurement.
  - Air_Temperature: Air temperature in degrees C.
  - Wind_Speed: Wind speed in metres per second.

## Context and usage
- The dataset is used in several current scientific studies, including those by PhD students, indicating its relevance for environmental monitoring and analysis.
