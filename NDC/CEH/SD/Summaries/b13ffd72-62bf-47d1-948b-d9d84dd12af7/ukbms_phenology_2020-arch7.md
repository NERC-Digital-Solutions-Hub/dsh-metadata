# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with voluntary data contributions from a large network of observers. It provides annual data on butterfly population status across the UK, with over 2,500 active sites each year, used to understand population changes and inform biodiversity policy.

## What data are collected and how

- Sampling framework comprises three methods:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) from April to September.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1-km transects, 2–3 visits per year, sampling common habitats.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
- Data are integrated across methods for analysis, with almost 2,000 standard transect sites currently sampled annually.

## Phenology data and metrics

- Phenology refers to timing of adult butterfly flight periods, derived from UKBMS transects with weekly counts during the main activity season.
- Phenology metrics include:
  - First and last appearance dates per site per year (for a given brood).
  - Peak date and peak count.
  - Mean flight date and standard deviation (SD) to measure synchrony.
  - Flight period range (days between first and last observation).
- Many species have multiple generations; data may be separated into up to two distinct flight periods for certain species (first and second broods). For some univoltine species (e.g., Brimstone, Peacock), separate early and summer flight periods are provided. For many species, phenology measures are provided for the entire flight period when generation separation is not possible due to overlap.
- Data quality and limitations are acknowledged due to varying survey effort and season length.

## Data quality control

- Data collected on standard forms and entered online (UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker), then uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators review data; ongoing validation throughout the season.
- Further automated/manual validation checks compare records against known distributions and typical site-year patterns; errors are corrected through queries and coordinated edits to the UKBMS dataset.

## Details of this data download

- Provides phenology data for all species, sites, and years with sufficient data, supplied as a CSV file.
- For 13 species, data are available for the entire flight period and separately for two distinct flight periods per year per site; for other species, data are available for the entire flight season only.
- Key columns:
  - SITENO, SITENAME, GRIDREF (6-figure accuracy, start location of transect), SPECIES_NAME, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, NUMBER_OF_BROODS, BROOD, FIRSTDAY, LASTDAY, PEAKDAY, PEAKCOUNT, MEAN_FLIGHT_DATE, FLIGHTPERIOD_SD, FLIGHTPERIOD_RANGE.
