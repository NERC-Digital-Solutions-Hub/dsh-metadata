# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - A collaborative, funded program organized by Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC, relying on volunteers.
  - Long-running, site-based annual data on butterfly population status; aims to understand biodiversity changes and inform policy.
  - Operates across more than 2,500 actively recorded sites each year, using multiple sampling methods that feed into a unified dataset.

- Data collection framework
  - Standard transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 26 weekly counts from April to September; ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares, 2–3 visits per year; ~800 squares.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts; methods tailored to specific species.

- Nature of data collected
  - Phenology metrics focusing on timing of adult butterfly flight periods.
  - Metrics include first/last observation dates, peak date/count, mean flight date, and flight period SD/range.
  - Data gaps due to uneven weekly sampling; multiple generations for some species; special handling for bivoltine/univoltine species where applicable.

- Quality control
  - Field data collected on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automatic in-system checks and regional coordinators validate data; follow-up queries ensure data integrity.
  - Additional automated/manual validation checks against species distributions and normal flight periods; edits made as needed.

- Details of this data download (phenology data)
  - CSV format containing phenology data for all species, sites, and years with sufficient data.
  - For 13 species, data available for entire flight period and separately for two flight periods; others for entire flight season only.
  - Key columns include SITENO, SITENAME, GRIDREF, SPECIES_NAME, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, NUMBER_OF_BROODS, BROOD, FIRSTDAY, LASTDAY, PEAKDAY, PEAKCOUNT, MEAN_FLIGHT_DATE, FLIGHTPERIOD_SD, FLIGHTPERIOD_RANGE.

- Data governance considerations for data stewards
  - Clear provenance and multi-organisation governance; ongoing data updates and versioning through regional coordinators.
  - Standardized metadata references (binomial and common names, grid references) and defined brood/flight period semantics.
  - Licensing supports open sharing with proper attribution; mechanisms for collaboration and scholarly credit.
