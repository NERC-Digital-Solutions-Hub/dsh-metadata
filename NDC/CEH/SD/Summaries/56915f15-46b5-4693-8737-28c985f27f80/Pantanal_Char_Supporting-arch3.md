- Data accessibility and governance notes
  - Each horizon’s charcoal concentration data and corresponding radiocarbon dates are organized to support age-depth modeling and cross-core comparisons
  - Full laboratory reporting accompanies dates, enabling transparent verification
  - The dataset is designed to support monitoring, synthesis, and policy-relevant analyses of environmental change in the Pantanal, with explicit metadata and QA procedures to facilitate data sharing and governance

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides standardized, horizon-based charcoal data with associated radiocarbon dating, enabling long-term environmental monitoring and fire regime reconstruction
  - Includes comprehensive metadata (location, lake characteristics, sampling methods) and QA, aiding data integration, governance, and reproducibility
  - Highlights the need for calibration of radiocarbon dates for inter-study comparisons and time-series analysis in monitoring contexts
  - Demonstrates rigorous data handling (deflocculation, sieving, counting, ISO-quality considerations) relevant to data quality assurance in monitoring frameworks

- Key considerations for future monitoring
  - Calibration of radiocarbon dates is necessary for cross-dataset comparability
  - Metadata completeness (especially around area units and sampling resolutions) is critical for data reuse and governance
  - Transparent sharing of underlying data and lab reports supports openness and reduces barriers to data integration across institutions and programmes
