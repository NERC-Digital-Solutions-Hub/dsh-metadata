## Data Structure and Content
- Charcoal concentration: particles >125 μm per cm3 at each 1-cm horizon.
- Data format: Each core has a separate CSV with horizon-level data; depth value is the midpoint of the 1-cm interval.
- Radiocarbon dates: Provided as headers in each file, creating age-depth profiles.

## Quality Control and Laboratory Procedures
- Standard laboratory procedures for charcoal extraction and counting.
- Deflocculation: sediment-type–dependent; 7% Na6P6O18 for clay-rich sediments; 10% KOH for organic-rich sediments.
- Deflocculation: heated to 80°C for 30 minutes.
- Additional cleaning: organic-rich residues washed, treated with 7% H2O2 for 24 hours at room temperature.
- Sieving: residues 125 μm and 250 μm.
- Counting: residues counted under a Bogorov tray with low-powered microscopy.
