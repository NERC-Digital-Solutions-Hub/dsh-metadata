- Data units and representation
  - Concentration data: charcoal particles >125 μm per cm3 at each 1-cm horizon in the sediment cores.
  - Depth value: midpoint of the 1-cm sampling interval.
  - Data structure: radiocarbon dates accompany the charcoal data as headers for each core’s CSV files.

- Quality control and laboratory procedures
  - Standard laboratory procedures for charcoal preparation and counting.
  - Deflocculation: chosen based on sediment type (7% Na hexametaphosphate for clay-rich; 10% KOH for organic-rich).
  - Processing: samples deflocculated at ~80°C for 30 minutes; residues treated with H2O2 for organic-rich sediments.
  - Sieving: residues sieved at 125 μm and 250 μm.
  - Counting: charcoal fragments counted under a microscope in a Bogorov tray.
  - Resolution: 1 cm; volume measured by water displacement.
  - Data structure confirms per-horizon concentration data and moisture-adjusted volumes.

- Data structure and access
  - Concentration data are stored in individual CSV files for each 1-cm horizon.
  - Radiocarbon dates for each core are included as headers in the corresponding CSV files.
  - Radiocarbon ages are uncalibrated conventional radiocarbon years BP.
  - Each core has an age-depth profile formed from discrete horizon dates (full laboratory reporting provided for each date).

- GIS-relevant notes for integration
  - Dataset links charcoal concentrations to exact core horizons, enabling age-depth modeling and spatial visualization.
  - Coordinates, lake attributes, and elevation support geospatial context and layer construction.
  - Data are organized per core with horizon-level chemistry and radiocarbon dating, suitable for linking to GIS-based temporal visualizations and landscape-scale analyses.
