  - Lake area: 0.1 m? (very small); Water depth: <1 m; Elevation: 88 masl
  - Core depth: 84 cm; Sediments: Organic clay - consolidated
  - Collection method: 7 cm diameter PVC tube, sliced field into 1 cm intervals

Notes:
- Depth values are the midpoint of the 1-cm sampling intervals.
- Units of recorded values: charcoal particles >125 μm per cm3 per 1-cm horizon.

## Data structure and outputs
- Concentration data are provided for each 1-cm horizon in individual CSV files.
- Radiocarbon dates associated with each core are included as headers in each file, forming an age-depth profile.
- Data are presented as uncalibrated conventional radiocarbon ages (BP).

## Radiocarbon dating and dating details
- Laguna Mandior e (M1): 3 radiocarbon dates; provider Beta Analytic; conventional ages in years BP; data structure uses 3 discrete horizons for an age-depth profile; full laboratory reporting provided.
- Laguna Mandior e (M5): 3 radiocarbon dates; provider Beta Analytic; conventional ages in years BP; 3 horizons for age-depth profile; full laboratory reporting provided.
- Laguna Mimoso: 2 radiocarbon dates; providers Beta Analytic and UGAMS; conventional ages in years BP; 2 horizons for age-depth profile; full laboratory reporting provided.
- Laguna Caceres: 3 radiocarbon dates; provider Beta Analytic; conventional ages in years BP; 3 horizons for age-depth profile; full laboratory reporting provided.
- Example uncalibrated dates (samples from Caceres and Mandior cores) are listed with sample depths, dating material, conventional ages, and, where available, δ13C values.

## Quality control and laboratory methods
- Standard laboratory procedures for charcoal extraction and counting.
- Deflocculation tailored to sediment type:
  - Clay-rich sediments: 200 ml of 7% sodium hexametaphosphate (Na6P6O18)
  - Organic-rich sediments: 200 ml of 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH)
- Heating: hotplate at 80°C for 30 minutes.
- Post-deflocculation processing: additional washing, 24-hour H2O2 treatment for organic-rich residues.
- Sieving: residues counted at 125 μm and 250 μm.
- Counting: under low-powered microscope using Bogorov tray.
- Volume measurements: via water displacement.

## Data accessibility and management
- Outputs stored as separate CSV files per core with radiocarbon dates included in file headers.
- Radiocarbon dates come from commercial laboratories (e.g., Beta Analytic; UGAMS) with full laboratory reporting.
- Depths correspond to the stratigraphic position of the charcoal data for each horizon, enabling reproducible age-depth interpretation.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides time-resolved charcoal concentrations that support reconstruction of fire history and environmental change in the Pantanal.
- Data are formatted for integration with other environmental datasets and standardised for cross-site comparisons.
- Clear documentation of collection, processing, and dating enhances transparency and reusability for policy monitoring and environmental health assessments over time.
