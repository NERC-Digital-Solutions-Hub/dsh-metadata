# Supporting information

- The CHESS-PE dataset provides two daily potential evapotranspiration estimates on a 1 km grid over Great Britain (1961-2017), derived from CHESS-met meteorological variables and CEH-GEAR precipitation.
- Two PET variables are included:
  - PET: Penman-Monteith potential evapotranspiration for a well-watered grass surface.
  - PETI: PET with interception correction, accounting for rainfall interception and daytime interception storage dynamics.
- This release supersedes the previous CHESS-PE version (2016) with several updates:
  - Extended data to 2016-2017.
  - Updated netCDF metadata for all years.
  - Bug fixes:
    - Humidity deficit limited to zero (affecting ~4% of data; mean PET increases by ~0.001 mm/day, ~0.1%).
    - PETI overestimation corrected (affecting ~63% of data; PETI decreases by ~0.02 mm/day, ~1.5% overall; winter differences up to -4%, summer ~-1%).
- Calculation and methodology (key points):
  - PET is computed from Ta, qa, downward longwave/shortwave radiation (Ld, Sd), and surface pressure using the Penman-Monteith equation; assumes a grass surface with stomatal resistance of 70 s/m.
  - PETI uses the same equation as PET for transpiration plus an interception component (Ei) on wet days, with an initial interception store (S0) and a total interception capacity (Stot), modeled with an exponential dry-down.
  - The CHESS-PE PET and PETI calculations are based on FAO-standard references (e.g., Allen et al., 1998) and prior Robinson et al. work (2017, 2016, 2020).
- Input data sources:
  - PET: CHESS-met meteorological variables (Ta, qa, Ld, Sd, p*).
  - PETI: all above plus CEH-GEAR precipitation (CHESS-met precipitation scaled to appropriate units).
- File format and data structure:
  - NetCDF files (CF-compliant) following CEH gridded dataset conventions.
  - Data stored as monthly files, with one file for each variable.
- Data availability and access:
  - Hosted by the Environmental Information Data Centre.

- Known issues:
  - ArcGIS reads CF files with projected coordinate systems assuming WGS 1984, causing a positional offset (10–100 m) for CHESS-PE layers; users should adjust layers using ArcGIS tools and consult the ArcGIS documentation.
