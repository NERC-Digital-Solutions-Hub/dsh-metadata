# Supporting information

- The Climate hydrology and ecology research support system potential evapotranspiration dataset (1961-2017) [CHESS-PE] provides two daily potential evapotranspiration estimates on a 1 km grid over Great Britain, derived from CHESS-met meteorological variables and CEH-GEAR precipitation.
- The two PET variables are:
  - PET: Penman-Monteith potential evapotranspiration for a well-watered grass surface (mm/day).
  - PETI: PET with interception correction, accounting for rainfall interception with an interception store that dries over time; the daily PETI is the sum of interception and transpiration components.
- Versions and release history:
  - This release supersedes the previous CHESS-PE version (2016) for:
    - Extension to 2016-17 data.
    - Updated netCDF metadata for all years.
    - Bug fixes:
      - PET: humidity deficit (qs - qa) is constrained to a minimum of zero; affects ~4% of data; overall mean PET increases by ~0.001 mm/day (0.1%), with larger differences at some times/locations.
      - PETI: overestimation of interception correction corrected; affects ~63% of data; overall PETI decreases by ~0.02 mm/day (~1.5%), with winter differences up to ~4% and summer ~1%.
- Input data sources:
  - PET uses CHESS-met variables: air temperature (Ta), specific humidity (qa), downward longwave and shortwave radiation (Ld, Sd), surface air pressure (p*).
  - PETI uses the same inputs plus CHESS-met precipitation (CEH-GEAR precipitation) scaled to appropriate units.
- Calculation details:
  - PET (E_P) is computed via the Penman-Monteith equation for a well-watered grass surface, assuming stomatal resistance of 70 s m^-1.
  - PETI uses the same PET framework plus interception on wet days, with interception E_I calculated using zero stomatal resistance; PETI incorporates a drying-store model with parameters S0 and S_tot.
- File format and data structure:
  - NetCDF format, CF-compliant, following CEH gridded dataset conventions.
  - Data stored as monthly files; one file per variable.
- Data accessibility:
  - Stored by the Environmental Information Data Centre; downloadable from the CEH catalogue.

- Known data handling issues:
  - ArcGIS reading issue for CF-compliant files with projected coordinate systems: ArcGIS assumes WGS 1984 datum, causing a positional offset (≈10–100 m) when the dataset uses a different datum; can be corrected in ArcGIS tools per documentation.
