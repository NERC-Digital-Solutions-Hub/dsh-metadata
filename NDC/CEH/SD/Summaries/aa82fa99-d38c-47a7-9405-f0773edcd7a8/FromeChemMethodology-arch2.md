# Methodology

- Long-term river water monitoring at the East Stoke flow gauging station
  - Manual sampling from the main river flow
  - Samples filtered on return to the laboratory within one hour; analysed typically within a few days to a week to minimise sample stability errors
  - Any samples not analysed within this window due to instrument failure, QC issues, or staffing were omitted from the dataset

- Data comparability and changes in methodology
  - Analytical methods have changed over the 44-year dataset
  - When a method changed, old and new methods were run in parallel for 3–6 months to align results
  - Notable data adjustments or omissions were documented under each determinand heading

- Data handling and availability
  - Data quality assurance and transparency emphasized
  - Created datasets were stored and uploaded to appropriate portals
  - Ongoing aim to increase dataset value by standardised approaches and enabling access to underlying data

- Nitrogen analysis (NO3-N and TON)
  - 1965–1986: NO3-N measured by diphenyl sulphonic acid colorimetric method
  - 1986–2004: TON measured via Flow Injection Analysis with cadmium reduction converting NO3 to NO2, then colorimetric detection
  - 2006 onward: NO3-N measured by ion chromatography
  - TON closely approximates NO3-N in many rivers; method changes include cross-method comparisons showing a small bias (0.08–0.12 mg/L higher with cadmium reduction method)

- Phosphorus analysis
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) measured 1965 onward using molybdenum blue colorimetry
  - 1965–1984/85: manual reagent addition; 1986 onward: automated via Flow Injection Analyser
  - SRP samples typically analysed within 6 hours of sampling (1998 baseline), with later variations in timing
  - Total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) determined by persulfate digestion and colorimetric reaction
  - 2004–2006 LOCAR period used ICP-OES for TP; pre-2004 and 2007–2009 TP data differed from ICP-OES results
  - Data from 2004–2006 analysed by CEH differed significantly from both pre-2004 and 2007–2009 data, leading to omission of this two-year portion from the long-term data set

- Dissolved reactive silicon (silicic acid)
  - Measured in filtered samples using acid ammonium molybdate to form silicomolybdenum blue
  - Quantified spectrophotometrically at 810 nm
  - Automated from 1986 (Flow Injection Analyser) and later with Seal Auto Analyser 2 (from 2006); reductant changed from metol-sulphite to tin(II) chloride

- Major anions and cations
  - Na, K, Mg, Ca: measured 1965–1996 by atomic absorption spectroscopy
  - 1997–2009: measured by ion chromatography
  - Sulphate and chloride: measured by ion chromatography from 1997 onward

- pH
  - Measured on unfiltered samples within 6 hours of sampling
  - 1965–1995 and 2006–2009: pH probe with standard buffers
  - 1996–2004: Metrohm 702 Autotitrator with Aquatrode electrode
  - Equilibration: about two minutes before measurement

- Conductivity
  - Measured on unfiltered samples within 6 hours using a handheld conductivity meter
  - Two-minute equilibration before measurement

- Alkalinity
  - Determined by titration of unfiltered samples
  - 1996–2004: Metrohm 702 Autotitrator used
  - Alkalinity calculated using Gran titration plot

- Suspended solids
  - Known mass of river water filtered, dried to constant weight at 70°C for 24 hours, then weighed to determine suspended solids

- Standards and references
  - Methodologies anchored to standard methods and contemporary literature (e.g., APHA, Murphy & Riley, Mullin & Riley, Eisenreich et al., Tecator, Bowes et al.)
  - Explicit notes on when and why certain data were omitted or adjusted due to methodological differences

- Key implications for environmental monitoring analyses
  - Longitudinal consistency achieved through parallel-method validation during transitions
  - Transparent handling of data gaps and method-related biases to maintain a credible long-term record
  - Documentation supports downstream data users in recalibrating or integrating data with other datasets or portals
