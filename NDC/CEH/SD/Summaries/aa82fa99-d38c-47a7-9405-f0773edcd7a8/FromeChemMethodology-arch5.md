# Methodology

- Overview
  - Water samples were collected from the main flow at East Stoke flow gauging station, filtered on return to the lab, and analyzed promptly (usually within a few days, always within one week) to minimise sample stability errors.
  - Data gaps occurred when analyses could not be completed due to instrument failure, QC failures, or staffing limitations, and such samples were omitted from the dataset.
  - Over the long-term, analytical methods changed; when method changes occurred, old and new methods were run in parallel for 3–6 months to assess comparability. Any observed changes in values due to methodological shifts are discussed in the corresponding determinand sections.

- Data governance and provenance
  - Detailed documentation of analytical methodologies and changes is provided to preserve data provenance and enable assessment of comparability over time.
  - Parallel method comparisons and notes on method-induced offsets support traceability and quality assurance.
  - Omissions and exclusions are explicitly described to maintain dataset integrity and transparent data lineage.

- Determinands and historical methods
  - Nitrogen (NO3-N, nitrate)
    - 1965–1986: Diphenyl sulphonic acid colorimetric method (APHA, 1965).
    - 1986–2004: Flow Injection Analysis (FIAStar 5012) with cadmium reduction (NO3-N and NO2-N combined as TON) and colorimetric detection; comparisons with the former method showed slightly higher values (0.08–0.12 mg/L) using cadmium reduction.
    - 2006 onward: Nitrate-N measured by ion chromatography (Dionex DX500). TON approximates NO3-N for the river studied.
  - Phosphorus (SRP, TP, TDP)
    - SRP (soluble reactive phosphorus): 1965 onward using molybdenum blue colorimetry; manual addition of reagents initially, automated in 1986 (FIAStar 5012); analyzed within about 6 hours (1965–2004) to limit instability errors.
    - 2004–2006 (LOCAR): analysis performed by Thames Water laboratories.
    - 2007–2009: analysis at CEH Wallingford using Seal Auto Analyser 2; SRP analyzed within 24 hours of arrival.
    - TP (total phosphorus) and TDP: digestion of filtered/unfiltered subsamples with acidic persulphate in an autoclave, followed by molybdate reaction and spectrophotometric measurement at 880 nm; LOCAR period (2004–2006) used ICP-OES, with significant differences compared to pre-2004 CEH data and 2007–2009 data; some data portions (e.g., River Frome data 2004–2006) omitted due to discrepancies.
  - Dissolved reactive silicon
    - Measured by molybdate reaction forming yellow silicomolybdenum blues, quantified at 810 nm; automated from 1986 (FIAstar 5012) and later with Seal Auto Analyser 2 (2006), with metol-sulfite reductant replaced by tin(II) chloride (Tecator, 1998).
  - Major cations and anions
    - Na, K, Mg, Ca: 1965–1996 by atomic absorption spectroscopy; 1997–2009 by ion chromatography.
    - SO4 and Cl: measured by ion chromatography from 1997.
  - pH
    - Unfiltered samples measured within 6 hours of sampling.
    - 1965–1995 and 2006–2009: pH probe with standard buffer calibrations.
    - 1996–2004: Metrohm 702 Autotitrator with Aquatrode electrode, using standard buffer calibrations; two-minute pre-measurement equilibration.
  - Conductivity
    - Measured on unfiltered samples within 6 hours using a handheld conductivity meter, with a two-minute equilibration period.
  - Alkalinity
    - Determined by titration of unfiltered samples; 1996–2004 used Metrohm 702 Autotitrator; alkalinity derived from a Gran titration plot.
  - Suspended solids
    - Determined by filtering known volumes (~1 kg of river water), drying filters to constant weight at 70°C for 24 hours, and weighing.

- Data quality, comparability, and limitations
  - Cross-method biases identified: e.g., NO3-N values were slightly higher (0.08–0.12 mg/L) with cadmium reduction method compared to the colorimetric nitrate method.
  - TP data showed notable discrepancies between ICP-OES results (LOCAR period) and pre-2004 data, and other datasets (2004–2006) were omitted due to differences; this highlights the need to consider method-related shifts when interpreting long-term trends.
  - Sub-datasets and changes are explicitly documented to allow users to account for methodological transitions when analysing trends.

- Data handling and availability
  - Long-term dataset maintained with explicit notes on method changes, parallel runs, and data omissions to ensure robust provenance.
  - Where data could not be validated or aligned across methods, these data are excluded or clearly flagged with context within the determinand discussions.
