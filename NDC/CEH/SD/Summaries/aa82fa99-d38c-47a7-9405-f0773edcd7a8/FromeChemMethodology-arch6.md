# Methodology

- Overview
  - Long-term water quality dataset for River Frome at East Stoke, with samples filtered on return to the laboratory and analysed as soon as possible to minimise sample stability errors.
  - Samples not analysed within the allotted time were omitted from the dataset.
- Sampling and data inclusion
  - Main river flow sampled at the East Stoke gauging station; analyses typically completed within a week.
  - Omission criteria include instrument breakdowns, failure to meet quality control standards, or insufficient analytical staff time.
  - Across the dataset lifetime, methodological changes were managed by parallel running old and new methods for 3–6 months to maintain comparability; any value changes due to new methods are discussed in the relevant determinand notes.
- Determinands and analytical methods
  - Nitrogen (NO3-N and TON)
    - 1965–1986: nitrate as NO3-N by diphenyl sulphonic acid colorimetry.
    - 1986–2004: combined NO3-N and NO2-N (TON) measured after cadmium reduction to NO2, with colorimetry; slight method-related differences observed.
    - 2006 onward: nitrate-N analysed by ion chromatography (Dionex); TON approximates NO3-N in most rivers.
  - Phosphorus
    - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) measured by molybdenum blue colorimetry; various handling/automation steps from 1965 onward.
    - TP and TDP: digestion of filtered and unfiltered samples with acidic persulfate, followed by molybdate reaction and spectrophotometric measurement; pre-2004, LOCAR 2004–2006, and CEH 2007–2009 periods used different approaches (including ICP-OES during LOCAR), causing notable inter-method differences.
    - A two-year portion (2004–2006) analysed by different laboratories showed significant differences and was omitted from the long-term data set.
  - Dissolved reactive silicon
    - Measured via molybdate-based method forming silicomolybdenum blues; automation progressed from FIAstar 5012 (1986) to Seal AutoAnalyzer 2 (2006), with reductant changes from metol-sulfite to tin(II) chloride.
  - Major ions and cations
    - Na, K, Mg, Ca: atomic absorption spectroscopy (1965–1996); IC (1997–2009).
    - Sulfate and chloride: IC (1997 onward).
  - pH
    - Measured on unfiltered samples within 6 hours of sampling; method evolution included colorimetric pH indicators (1965–1995) and later an Autotitrator (1996–2004) with glass electrode; equilibration times adjusted.
  - Conductivity
    - Measured on unfiltered samples within 6 hours using handheld meters with a 2-minute equilibration.
  - Alkalinity
    - Determined by titration with HCl; Metrohme 702 Autotitrator used 1996–2004; Gran titration plots used for calculation.
  - Suspended solids
    - Measured by filtering a known mass, drying the filter to constant weight at 70°C for 24 h, and weighing.
- Temporal changes and data comparability
  - Method changes prompted parallel testing to align results; long-term comparability relies on documentation of changes and discussion in determinand-specific notes.
  - Notable inter-method differences include TON vs NO3-N interpretation, SRP stability, and TP discrepancies between ICP-OES and earlier methods.
  - Specific long-term data adjustments included omitting a two-year portion (2004–2006) due to significant discrepancies.
- Data quality controls and gaps
  - Omission of data when analyses could not be completed within the defined time window.
  - Acknowledgement of variability introduced by method changes and laboratory differences, with explicit notes in the respective determinand sections.
