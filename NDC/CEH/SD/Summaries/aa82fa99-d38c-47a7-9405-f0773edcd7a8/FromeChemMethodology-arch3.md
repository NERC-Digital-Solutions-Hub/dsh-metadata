# Methodology

- Sampling and handling
  - Water samples collected manually from the main river flow at the East Stoke flow gauging station.
  - Samples filtered on return to the laboratory within about one hour and analysed as rapidly as possible (usually within a few days and always within one week) to minimise sample stability issues.
  - Any samples not analysed within the allotted time due to instrument breakdown, QC failures, or staff shortages were omitted.

- Long-term data comparability
  - Analytical methodologies changed over the 44-year dataset; old and new methods were run in parallel for 3–6 months during transitions to ensure comparability.
  - Changes in methodologies and any resulting shifts in values are discussed under each determinand heading.

- Nitrogen analysis
  - NO3-N (1965–1986): diphenyl sulphonic acid colorimetric method (APHA, 1965).
  - TON (1986–2004): combined NO3-N and NO2-N measured by Flow Injection Analysis with cadmium reduction, then colorimetry; comparisons with the older method showed slight positive bias (0.08–0.12 mg/L).
  - NO3-N (from 2006): analysed by ion chromatography (Dionex DX500); TON closely approximates NO3-N in most rivers.

- Phosphorus analysis
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) (1965 onward): molybdenum blue colorimetry; manual analysis until 1986, automated FIA thereafter.
  - SRP samples analysed within 6 hours of sampling (1965–2004) to minimise instability.
  - Total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) by persulfate digestion and molybdate reaction; 2004–2006 LOCAR data used ICP-OES for TP, which differed from pre-2004 CEH and 2007–2009 data; a 2004–2006 River Frome data subset analysed by CEH was omitted due to significantly lower results.

- Dissolved reactive silicon
  - Measured in filtered samples via molybdate reaction forming silicomolybdenum blues, quantified spectrophotometrically at 810 nm.
  - Automated in 1986 (FIAstar 5012) and later (2006) with a Seal Auto Analyser; reductant changed from metol-sulphite to tin(II) chloride.

- Major ions
  - Na, K, Mg, Ca: measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (1965–1996), then by ion chromatography (1997–2009).
  - Sulphate and chloride also measured by ion chromatography from 1997.

- pH
  - Measured on unfiltered samples within 6 hours of sampling.
  - Measurement methods changed over time: 1965–1995 and 2006–2009 used pH probes; 1996–2004 used a Metrohm 702 Autotitrator with Aquatrode electrode; 2-minute equilibration time used before measurement.

- Conductivity
  - Measured on unfiltered samples within 6 hours using handheld conductivity meters with a 2-minute equilibration.

- Alkalinity
  - Determined by titration with hydrochloric acid.
  - 1996–2004 used a Metrohm 702 Autotitrator; alkalinity calculated from a Gran titration plot.

- Suspended solids
  - Determined by filtering a known mass (~1 kg) of river water, drying the filter paper to constant weight at 70 °C for 24 hours.

- Data handling and governance notes
  - The document records the rationale for methodological changes, parallel testing during transitions, and any data omissions due to timing or inter-method discrepancies, with explicit notes for certain time periods where comparability was affected.
