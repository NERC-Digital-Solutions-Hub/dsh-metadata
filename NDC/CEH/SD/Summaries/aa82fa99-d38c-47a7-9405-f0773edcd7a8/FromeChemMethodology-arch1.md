# Methodology

## Overview
- Water samples were collected from the main river flow at East Stoke, filtered on return to the lab, and analysed rapidly (typically within a week) to minimise sample stability errors.
- Samples not analysed within the allotted time due to instrument issues, QC failures, or staffing constraints were omitted from the dataset.
- The long-term nature of the dataset means analytical methods changed over time; when changes occurred, old and new methods were run in parallel for 3–6 months to assess compatibility. Any value shifts due to method changes are discussed under each determinand.

## Sampling and sample handling
- Sampling was manual at the flow gauging station; samples were filtered after collection and analysed promptly to reduce stability-related errors.

## Nitrogen analysis (NO3-N and TON)
- 1965–1986: NO3-N determined by diphenyl sulphonic acid colorimetry.
- 1986–2004: Combined NO3-N and NO2-N (TON) measured via Flow Injection Analysis with cadmium reduction and colorimetry.
  - Cadmium reduction tended to yield slightly higher results (0.08–0.12 mg/L) than the older method.
- 2006–present: Nitrate-N analysed by ion chromatography (Dionex DX500); TON closely approximates NO3-N in most rivers, so the dataset is referred to as NO3-N or nitrate overall.
- Nitrite alone typically < 0.05 mg/L.

## Phosphorus analysis (SRP, TP, TDP)
- SRP: Soluble reactive phosphorus measured by molybdenum blue colorimetry.
  - 1965–1986: Manual reagent addition and spectrophotometry.
  - 1986 onward: Automated with FIAStar FIA (Flow Injection Analysis).
  - 1965–2004: SRP analysed within ~6 hours of sampling to minimise instability.
  - 2004–2006 (LOCAR): Analysed at Thames Water laboratories.
  - 2007–2009: Analysed at CEH Wallingford using a Seal AA3.
- TP and TDP: Determined after digestion with acidic potassium persulfate.
  - Pre-LOCAR: Analysis via pre-2004 methods; post-LOCAR (2004–2006) TP data obtained by ICP-OES.
  - 2004–2006 TP data by ICP-OES differed significantly from CEH laboratory data pre-2004 and from 2007–2009 data.
  - Data from River Frome at East Stoke analysed by CEH (Bowes et al., 2009a) during 2004–2006 were significantly lower than ICP-OES results; as a result, the 2004–2006 two-year portion was omitted from the long-term dataset.

## Dissolved reactive silicon
- Measured as dissolved silicon (silicic acid) in filtered samples using molybdate chemistry to form silicomolybdenum and quantified spectrophotometrically.
- Automation: 1986 (FIAStar 5012) and later (2006) with a Seal Auto Analyser 2.
- Reagent changes included replacement of metol-sulphite reductant with tin(II) chloride.

## Major cations and anions
- Sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium: 1965–1996 by atomic absorption spectroscopy; 1997–2009 by ion chromatography.
- Sulphate and chloride: measured by ion chromatography from 1997 onward.

## pH
- Measured on unfiltered samples within 6 hours of sampling.
- Instrumentation varied over time (pH probe, Autotitrator with glass electrode, etc.) with different calibration buffers and a 2-minute equilibration.

## Conductivity
- Measured on unfiltered samples within 6 hours using a handheld conductivity meter with a 2-minute equilibration.

## Alkalinity
- Determined by titration with hydrochloric acid.
- 1996–2004: Metrohm 702 Autotitrator used; titration plots produced via Gran method.

## Suspended solids
- Determined by filtering known volumes (~1 kg of river water), drying pre-weighed filters at 70°C to constant weight (24 h).

## Data quality, comparability, and gaps
- Parallel method runs (3–6 months) were used to assess compatibility after methodological changes.
- TON is used as a proxy for nitrate-N when convenient, but explicit NO3-N values are reported from ion chromatography since TON approximates NO3-N in many rivers.
- Some long-term inconsistencies led to omissions:
  - 2004–2006 TP data via ICP-OES were omitted from the long-term dataset due to discrepancies with pre-2004 CEH data and 2007–2009 data.
  - A separate 2004–2006 subset analysed by CEH (Bowes et al., 2009a) was also omitted due to being significantly lower than ICP-OES results.
- Overall, the data collection emphasizes timing (within days of collection), cross-method calibration, and explicit notes on any method-driven biases.
