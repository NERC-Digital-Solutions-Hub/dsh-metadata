# Column header/Determinand

## Overview
- Data dictionary for a river water quality monitoring dataset. Documents the column headers, determinands, sampling metadata, and standardized terminology used to capture physical-chemical water quality data over time.

## Key variables and measurements
- Sampling Date and Sampling Time
- Hydrological/physical parameters: Average daily river flow; Temperature of water sample; pH; Electrical conductivity; Gran alkalinity; Suspended solids.
- Chemical constituents (dissolved or particulate forms): Dissolved nitrate; Dissolved reactive silicon; Total Phosphorus; Total dissolved phosphorus; Soluble reactive phosphorus; Dissolved chloride; Dissolved sulphate; Dissolved sodium; Dissolved potassium; Dissolved magnesium; Dissolved calcium; Dissolved ammonium (NH4).
- Units and labels: Many determinands have specific units (e.g., deg C, µS cm-1, mEq L-1, mg/L, µg/L) and some are unitless (e.g., pH). The table provides both human-readable labels and machine-readable URIs for each determinand and its units.

## Standards and ontologies
- Each determinand and unit is linked to a standardized URI (e.g., CAST Ontologies), ensuring consistent naming and interoperability across datasets.
- Examples include Temperature (Determinant URI) and Degrees Celsius (Units URI); pH is provided as a unitless determinand with its own URI.

## Data quality, structure, and accessibility
- Designed to be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed for analysis.
- Outputs are intended to be presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals for accessibility.

## Relevance for monitoring and policy
- Enables consistent, time-series assessment of environmental health and policy performance.
- Supports standardized analyses and comparisons across monitoring programs and time periods.

## Challenges and opportunities
- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data (avoiding single-use datasets).
- Improving access to underlying data used to produce final outputs for broader reuse.
