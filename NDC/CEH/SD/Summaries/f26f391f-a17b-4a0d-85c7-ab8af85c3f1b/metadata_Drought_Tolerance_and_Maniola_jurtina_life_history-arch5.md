# Life history data

## Experimental design and collection method
- Newly hatched larvae were randomly selected from lab stock populations originating from nine different UK populations.
- Larvae were placed (four per plant) on potted Poa trivialis host plants, either control or drought-stressed.
- Rearing occurred in netted outdoor insectary cages at UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, exposing larvae to natural temperatures, light, and photoperiod while protected from rain and wind.
- Sample sizes: 108 larvae in control and 216 larvae in drought-stress groups; each laboratory source population contributed equally to both treatments.
- Monitoring points: 49 days after hatching (pre-overwintering), 162 days after hatching (post-overwintering during larval growth), and 309 days after hatching (late larval growth and pupation).
- Measurements: larval masses (using an Ohaus Explorer balance, accuracy 0.1 mg) recorded for individuals surviving to the second check point; survival to the third check point also recorded.

## Description of headers (data columns)
- Population, Description: Site in the UK from which the population was sourced.
- PlantID, Description: Unique identifier for an individual host plant used for larval rearing.
- LarvalID, Description: Larval identification number (1–4) placed on each host plant.
- HostPlantTreatment, Description: Drought stress vs. control treatment for host plant during rearing.
- HatchDate, Description: Date larvae hatched and assigned to the host plant treatment.
- CheckDate1, Description: Date of the first growth monitoring point (49 days).
- CheckDate2, Description: Date of the second growth monitoring point (162 days).
- NumLarvaeFound, Description: Number of larvae found at the second growth monitoring point.
- LarvalMass, Description: Mass of the larva (in mg) at the second growth monitoring point.
- SurviveCheck, Description: Whether the larva survived to the third growth monitoring point (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).
- N.B. empty cells in the spreadsheet = missing data (e.g., due to death of the larva).

## Quality control
- Data were collected under standardised conditions using standard, published methods.
- Data entry was performed manually with quality assurance tools (input masks, input conditions) to ensure coherence and consistency.
