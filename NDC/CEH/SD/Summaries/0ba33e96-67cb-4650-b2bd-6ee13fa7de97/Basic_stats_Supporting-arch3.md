# Summary statistics for performance of a genotyping microarray for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex

## What is recorded and the data form
- Summary statistics for a genotyping microarray covering ~50,000 SNPs (SNPs) across 87 Scots pine samples.
- Key metrics per locus: conversion rate (CR), mean allelic frequency (MAF), and polymorphism status (polymorphic or monomorphic).
- Columns include:
  - SNP_ID: SNP identifier
  - ConversionType: Polymorphic or Monomorphic
  - MAF > 0.1 indicator: indicates if mean allele frequency exceeds 0.1
  - CR: call rate
- Data are presented as state (polymorphic/monomorphic), mean allele frequency, and conversion rate averaged across the 87 samples.

## When the data were collected
- Data assembled in 2016.

## How the data were collected
- Genotyping array comprised 49,829 SNPs sourced as follows:
  - 49,052 SNPs from transcriptome sequencing of four pine species: Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, and P. uliginosa. Included SNPs common to all species and SNPs fixed in one species but polymorphic in others.
  - SNPs filtered by the array manufacturer (Thermo Fisher) based on p-convert values and probe recommendations (avoiding polymorphisms within 35 bp).
  - 578 SNPs added from candidate genes (279 genes) resequenced in prior studies.
  - 14 mtDNA-targeted SNPs.
  - 185 SNPs putatively linked to susceptibility to Dothistroma needle blight (discovered in Pinus radiata; data in ENA ERS1034542-53).
- Purpose-built to manufacture a genotyping array for Scots pine and related Pinus mugo complex.
- Summary statistics calculated as mean across 87 genotyped samples.
