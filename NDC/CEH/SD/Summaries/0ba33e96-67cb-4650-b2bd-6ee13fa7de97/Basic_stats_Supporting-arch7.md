# Summary statistics for performance of a genotyping microarray for a test set of 87 samples for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and closely related members of the Pinus mugo complex

- What is recorded
  - Summary statistics for the performance of a genotyping microarray on a test set of 87 pine samples (Scots pine and closely related Pinus mugo complex).
  - For ~50,000 SNPs on a 50K SNP Axiom array: conversion rate, mean allelic frequency, and call rate per locus.
  - Per-locus columns: SNP_ID (ID), ConversionType (Poly = polymorphic, Mono = monomorphic), MAF > 0.1 flag (Y/N/NA), CR (call rate).
  
- Data composition
  - Total SNPs on the array: 49,829.
  - SNP sources and counts:
    - Transcriptome sequencing across four species (Pinus sylvestris, P. mugo, P. uncinata, P. uliginosa): 49,052 SNPs.
    - Candidate genes: 578 SNPs from 279 genes.
    - Mitochondrial DNA SNPs: 14.
    - SNPs associated with Dothistroma needle blight susceptibility (from Pinus radiata): 185.
  - Summary statistics are provided as state (polymorphic/monomorphic), mean allele frequency (MAF), and conversion rate (CR), estimated across all 87 genotypes.

- Data collection timeline and purpose
  - Data assembled in 2016.
  - Purpose: to manufacture a genotyping array for Scots pine and related species in the Pinus mugo complex.

- Methods and data quality
  - SNPs filtered by the array manufacturer (Thermo Fisher) based on p-convert values indicating array quality.
  - Probes were categorized as recommended or non-recommended, avoiding SNPs with polymorphisms within 35 bp.

- Responsible party
  - Data collection and interpretation led by Stephen Cavers (scav@ceh.ac.uk).

- Completeness and gaps
  - The completeness field is not filled in the provided text; no explicit statement about missing data beyond the described SNP sets.
