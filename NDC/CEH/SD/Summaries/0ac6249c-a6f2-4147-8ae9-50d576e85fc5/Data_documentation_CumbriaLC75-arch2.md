# Land Classification of Cumbria (1975)

- The document presents a land classification scheme for Cumbria, derived from environmental characteristics (climate, altitude, slope) and hierarchical analysis to define 16 Land Classes (strata).
- It explains data sources, methods, class descriptions, distribution, and implications for understanding landscape structure in the county.

## Data specification

- Format: ESRI Shapefile
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system / Projection: British National Grid OSGB1936, Transverse Mercator
- Extent: Great Britain
- Purpose: Provide a repeatable, standardized land classification framework for environmental monitoring and planning

## Data and sampling design

- County-wide grid: county divided into squares; central square from blocks of 3x3 km used as sample unit (approx. 11% sample).
- Attributes collected from one-inch scale Ordnance Survey maps; included both natural features and human artefacts (roads, buildings, etc.) as informative indirect environmental indicators; drift excluded due to map limitations.
- Geological attributes included to broaden feature range.
- Data analyzed with two multivariate methods:
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to identify discriminating characteristics between sample groups
  - Reciprocal Averaging (RA) ordination to assess relationships and test correlations
- Classification approach: 16 Land Classes derived from a dichotomous key, with a hierarchy used to classify remaining squares.

## The land classes (1–16) – brief characteristics

- Land Class 1: Lowland, Solway/Southern/Western coastal plain; flat to gently undulating; mixed farmland, medium quality pastures; variable soils (brown earths, nutrient-rich).
- Land Class 2: Slightly higher elevation but still lowland characteristics; Eden Valley/Solway Plain; undulating with hedges; medium to good quality arable/pasture; deep brown earth soils.
- Land Class 3: Lowland-like features at higher elevation (152–229 m); western Eden Valley; limestone influence; medium to poor quality pasture; stony brown earth soils.
- Land Class 4: Mixed with upland features; margins of central fells; variable topography; coniferous/broadleaf woods; varied agricultural quality; well-drained moorland soils.
- Land Class 5: Predominantly lowland alluvial plains; coast and Solway west/southlowland; intensive farming; deep brown earth soils.
- Land Class 6: Lowland with human artefacts (communications/urbanisation); north concentration; intensive grazing; deep brown earth soils.
- Land Class 7: Coastal estuarine sand and mud.
- Land Class 8: Coastal with extensive bare sand/mud; shoreline present; improved pasture and leys; deep, nutrient-rich soils.
- Land Class 9: Markedly upland, Lake District/Pennines foothills; conifers in blocks; poor agricultural land; moorland, waterlogged and acidic soils.
- Land Class 10: Upland with valley bottoms also; Lake District fells; mix of valley pasture and upland moorland; poor, shallow, acidic soils.
- Land Class 11: Complex mid-fell terrain; between high fells and valleys; broadleaved woods; poor upland grazing with variable soils.
- Land Class 12: Featureless low fells; extensive conifer plantations; poor land with improved pasture and moorland; acidic brown soils with peat present.
- Land Class 13: Steep Pennine/Skiddaw margins; few trees; poor, poorly drained moorland; extensive grazing; peaty soils.
- Land Class 14: High altitude summits/plateaux; Pennines and high fells; open range sheep grazing; deep peat soils.
- Land Class 15: Upper slopes of central Lake District fells; rugged, little trees; poor quality land with moorland and upland grassland.
- Land Class 16: Summits/highest slopes; most mountainous; barren; peaty soils.

## Spatial distribution and patterns

- Major division: upland vs lowland is the primary structuring of Cumbria’s landscape.
- Nearly two-thirds of Cumbria classified as lowland.
- Lowland classes (1–8) tend to occur in larger blocks; upland classes (9–16) form more cohesive, patchy patterns due to valley dissection and geology.
- Transitional classes (10–11) are relatively infrequent and variable.
- The landscape reflects links between altitude, geomorphology, geology, and land use.

## Analysis outputs and interpretation

- The 16 land classes differ in geology and land use characteristics, enabling interpretation of landscape composition and environmental context.
- The relative abundance of classes provides a county-wide snapshot; extreme classes (coastal and upland) are comparatively less frequent.
- The association patterns indicate how classes relate spatially, with upland classes more cohesive with each other than with lowland classes.

## Summary and implications for monitoring

- The methodology combines map-based attribute collection with multivariate analysis to produce a stable, hierarchical land classification suitable for monitoring landscape structure and changes over time.
- The dataset supports consistent outputs for environmental health assessments and policy performance by providing a standard reference classification of Cumbria’s land surface.
- Limitations include reliance on 1:1 inch OS map data and an 11% sample; drift exclusion; and potential regional biases inherent to historical datasets.
