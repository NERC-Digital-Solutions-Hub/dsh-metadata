# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Purpose and scope
- Provides annual data on butterfly population status in the UK through a large, site-based monitoring programme.
- Data underpin biodiversity status assessments and policy-relevant questions.
- Active since 1976 with over 2,500 sites currently recorded each year.

## Data collection and components
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects, 2–4 km, 5 m width, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) across ~2,000 sites.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum 2 in July/August), ~750 squares/year.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species.
- Data are synthesized from all methods to create comprehensive butterfly abundance indices.

## Data and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures, not absolute counts) per site and species.
- Indices reflect a constant proportion of population presence per site, with detection varying by species.
- Aggregation across sites uses the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) methodology (2016), with site-year weighting based on the proportion of the species flight period surveyed, to balance observed and extrapolated data.

## Quality control
- Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag data entry errors (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-season records).
- Regional transect coordinators review data; ongoing validation during the season.
- Additional automated and manual validation checks address distribution ranges, flight periods, first-time site records, and unusual abundances; corrections are made as needed.
