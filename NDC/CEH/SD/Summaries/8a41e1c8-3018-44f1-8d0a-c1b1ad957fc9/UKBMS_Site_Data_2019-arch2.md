# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Involves volunteers collecting annual data on butterfly population status to understand changes in insect populations and inform biodiversity policy.
  - Monitors across the UK since 1976 with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.

- Data collection and sampling framework
  - Three main components:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts from April to September (ideally 26 counts/year), ~2,000 sites.
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year (minimum 2 in July/August), ~750 squares/year.
    - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species.
  - Data collected from all methods are analyzed together to produce trends.

- Data and trend analysis
  - Abundance indices are relative measures of population size.
  - Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present; detectability varies by species.
  - Overall species indices produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with a weighting adjustment:
    - Data from each site in each year weighted by the proportion of the species flight period surveyed.
    - All counts across the season are used to model the seasonal pattern and extrapolate gaps; observed data have greater influence due to weighting.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
  - Automatic checks flag improbable entries; regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
  - Further automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range distributions, atypical abundances, or unusual site-year patterns; edits made as needed.
