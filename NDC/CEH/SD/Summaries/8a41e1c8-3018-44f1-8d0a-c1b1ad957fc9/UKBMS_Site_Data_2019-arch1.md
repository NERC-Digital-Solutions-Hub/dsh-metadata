# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). It relies on volunteer data and has monitored butterfly populations across the UK since 1976, with over 2,500 actively recorded sites annually.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status to understand biodiversity trends and answer policy questions.

## Data collection methods

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (typically 2–4 km) at sites chosen by recorders, recording all butterflies in a 5 m wide belt weekly from April to September (ideally 26 counts/year). ~2,000 sites currently sampled.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km square sampling with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year, including 750 squares annually; focuses on common habitats like farmland.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or groups.

## Nature of data and trend analysis

- Data are abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts. Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present, varying by species.
- Overall (collated) species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (developed 2016) with an adjustment: site-year data weighting based on the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed at that site/year.
- The method uses all seasonal counts (Pollard walks, WCBS, and reduced surveys) to estimate the seasonal pattern and extrapolate to account for gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

## Quality control

- Data workflow: field recording forms → online entry (via UKBMS data site or Transect Walker) → central database.
- Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., abnormally high counts, records outside known flight periods); coordinators review records.
- Regional transect coordinators validate data throughout the season; additional automated/manual validation screens identify records outside distributions, unusual timing, first-site records, or atypical abundances.
- Data corrections are made via queries and discussions with coordinators; edits update the main UKBMS dataset.
