# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). It relies on volunteers and provides annual data on butterfly population status through site-based monitoring.
- It has operated since 1976 and currently records data from over 2,500 actively monitored sites each year.
- Data from all sampling methods are analyzed together to inform biodiversity status and policy-related questions.
- For more details, the UKBMS website is https://www.ukbms.org/.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- UKBMS generates abundance indices (relative measures) based on counts from transect sections and sites, not absolute population sizes.
- Site indices reflect a relatively constant proportion of butterflies present, though detectability varies by species.
- Indices are combined across sites using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting that accounts for the proportion of the species flight period surveyed at each site/year.
- The method uses all counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, with observed data given greater weight.

## Quality control

- Data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker software before being uploaded to a central database.
- Automatic checks and regional transect coordinators validate data for anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods or distributions).
- Additional automated and manual validation procedures flag and address issues, including records outside known ranges, first-time site records, and atypical abundances.
- Data entry errors are corrected through bespoke queries and coordination with transect recorders when needed.
