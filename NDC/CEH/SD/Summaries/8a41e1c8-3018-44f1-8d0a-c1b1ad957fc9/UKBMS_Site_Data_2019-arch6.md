# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteers; provides annual data on butterfly population status from site-based monitoring.
  - Over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year; data from multiple sampling methods are analyzed together.
  - Data span 1976–2019 (this download); sensitive sites are excluded.

- Data collection methods
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects of 2–4 km, 5 m wide, weekly counts (April–September), ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August), ~750 squares per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, Timed Counts, and egg/larval web counts.
  - All methods’ data are analyzed together to support biodiversity status and policy questions.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Site indices reflect a constant proportion of local populations; detectability varies by species.
  - Indices combined with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016) and site-year weighting by flight period coverage.
  - Seasonal patterns are estimated from all counts to extrapolate gaps; observed data weighted more strongly than extrapolated data.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks for anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-flight-period records).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; ongoing checks throughout the season.
  - Further automated/manual validation for distribution range, flight period alignment, first-time site records, atypical abundances.
  - Corrections made through queries; edits applied to the UKBMS dataset as needed.
