# UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers contribute data, making the scheme a large-scale, ongoing biodiversity monitoring program.
- Aims aligned with data stewardship: ensure data governance, quality, accessibility, and usability for research, policy, and conservation decisions.

## Overview of data governance and stakeholders

- Partners provide governance, support, and interpretation of outputs; data are intended to be widely used while maintaining data quality and provenance.
- Data are shared under an Open Government Licence (OGL) with attribution requirements; collaboration and co-authorship are encouraged.

## Data collection and structure

- Sampling frameworks:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects 2–4 km long, recorded weekly (up to 26 visits/year) across ~2000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species.
- Timeframe and scope:
  - Data collected since 1976; current dataset includes over 2500 actively recorded sites annually.
  - Data from all methods are analyzed together to produce species abundance indices.
- Data elements:
  - Site number, site name, grid reference, easting, northing, transect length, country, number of sections, years surveyed, first/last year surveyed, and survey type (UKBMS vs WCBS).

## Data processing and trend analysis

- Indices are abundance-based, relative measures rather than absolute population sizes.
- Seasonal patterns and gaps are addressed using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (developed 2016) with site-year weighting based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
- All counts from the season (Pollard walks, WCBS, and reduced methods) contribute to species- and site-level indices, with emphasis on observed data over extrapolated data.

## Quality control and data validation

- Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker program.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods); recorders may adjust or confirm data.
- Regional transect coordinators validate records; continuous checking throughout the season.
- Post-entry validation includes checks for: out-of-range distributions, atypical abundances, first-time site records, and major deviations from normal site counts.
- Data edits are made after queries and consultations with coordinators/recorders where needed.

## Key considerations for Data Stewards

- Large, multi-system dataset with evolving submission practices and formats.
- Ensuring timely data transfer from many field recorders and maintaining interoperability across data sources.
- Governance of data access, licensing, attribution, and collaboration opportunities.
- Managing data quality across diverse survey types, sites, and years, including sensitive sites and historical data constraints.
