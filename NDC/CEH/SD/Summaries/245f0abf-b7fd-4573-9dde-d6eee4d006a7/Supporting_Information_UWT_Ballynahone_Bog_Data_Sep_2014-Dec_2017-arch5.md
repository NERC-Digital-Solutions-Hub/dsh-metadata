# Supporting information for Ammonia measurements from passive samplers at Ballynahone Bog field site (2014 - 2017)

## Overview
- Ammonia (NH3) measurements collected along a transect at Ballynahone National Park (Area of Special Scientific Interest/SAC and Ramsar site) in Northern Ireland.
- Managed locally by Ulster Wildlife Trust (UWT); analysis conducted by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Edinburgh (CEH).
- Data collection motivated by concerns that Ballynahone Bog is affected by NH3 emissions from nearby poultry livestock installations.
- Monitoring period: 2014–2017; samplers exposed in monthly cycles at the start of each month.
- Final dataset: UWT_Ballynahone_Bog_Data_Sep_2014-Dec_2017.csv; dataset includes quality flags and site identifiers.

## Sampling method and data collection
- Instrument: CEH ALPHA® passive samplers using a citric acid coated filter to capture NH3; protected by a PTFE membrane.
- Deployment: replicate samplers mounted on a shelter on a pole at ~1.5 m above ground; multiple samplers per site for reliability.
- Analysis: exposed samplers extracted into deionised water and analyzed by AMFIA (Ammonia Flow Injection Analysis) to determine NH3 concentration; results converted to ambient air concentration using a known uptake rate (0.003241315 m3 h-1) and exposure duration.
- Data handling: raw data included some mis-exposed samples or weather-related losses; such samples are flagged and should not be used for deposition estimates.

## Data quality, flags, and integrity
- Quality rules applied to raw data:
  - Coefficient of variation (CV) of replicates < 15% (valid, flag 103); CV ≥ 15% prompts evaluation for possible discard or retention with notes.
  - Missing samplers flagged as invalid (-1) with value -9999.00.
  - Samplers with durations longer or shorter than normal are flagged.
  - Local contamination or deviations noted on sample records; affected samplers evaluated and can be discarded; final site data use averages of valid results.
- Data status indicators and flags:
  - EMEP and internal data status codes accompany each row (e.g., data capture percentage, validity, and verification status).
  - Columns include: site name, network_id (UWT), parameter_id (alpha_NH3_g), measurement start/end dates and times, NH3 concentration (µg NH3 m-3), less-than flag, verification id, unit id (24 = µg NH3 m-3), data capture percentage, validity_id, EMEP code, and Month-Year.
- Resulting dataset: contains accepted data values with appropriate flags; enables traceability and quality assessment for each monthly observation per site.

## Dataset structure and metadata
- Dataset name: UWT_Ballynahone_Bog_Data_Sep_2014-Dec_2017.csv.
- Each row represents one month of data for a single site; fields include:
  - Site name and unique identifier
  - Network identifier (UWT)
  - Parameter type (alpha_NH3_g)
  - Exposure period dates and times
  - Measured NH3 concentration (µg NH3 m-3)
  - Detection and verification indicators (e.g., less than detection limit, verification status)
  - Data capture percentage and validity status
  - EMEP data status codes
  - Month-Year of measurement
- Site information provides precise coordinates and sampling inlet height (1.5 m) for eight sites (bog_1 to bog_8); start date 01/09/2014; end date listed as ongoing.

## Site information (spatial and operational context)
- Ballynahone bog_1 through bog_8:
  - Each site has latitude/longitude coordinates and consistent inlet height of 1.5 m above ground.
  - Start date: 01/09/2014; End date: ongoing in the provided data.
- Data coverage supports transect-level interpretation of ambient NH3 across Ballynahone Bog and related emissions gradients.

## Governance and reuse considerations for Data Stewards
- Provenance and custody:
  - Data generated by UWT with analysis by CEH; final QA/QA checks recorded in dataset flags.
  - Clear metadata on measurement method, uptake rate, units, and site attributes facilitates interoperability.
- Metadata completeness and interoperability:
  - Detailed column definitions and EMEP flag mappings enable consistent interpretation across datasets and systems (e.g., UK-AIR contexts).
- Data quality management:
  - Maintain and update CV-based QA rules, tracking of missing samplers, duration anomalies, and local contamination notes.
  - Ensure ongoing documentation of any re-submissions or verifications (data status codes) and versioning of the dataset.
- Operational considerations:
  - Timely data submission from site operators to minimize gaps; manage heterogeneity of formats across multiple sites and instruments.
  - Monitor for large datasets and ensure scalable storage, cataloging, and discoverability in relevant portals.
- Reuse guidance:
  - Treat per-site monthly records with associated flags as the authoritative basis for deposition estimates, trend analyses, and regulatory reporting.
  - Consider incorporating site coordinates and sampling conditions (inlet height, date/time) into downstream analyses to contextualize NH3 concentration results.
