# Supporting documentation for 13-Animal_Feeding.csv

## Overview
- This document provides metadata and field descriptions for the 13-Animal_Feeding.csv dataset, focusing on animal feeding details used in environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
- It itemizes the general data elements, their meanings, and the units or notes where applicable, highlighting how abbreviations relate to sample codes.

## Data Elements and Definitions
- Animal
  - Explanation: General type of animal
  - Units: n/a
  - Notes: n/a
- Location
  - Explanation: Name of the location where the sample was collected
  - Units: n/a
  - Notes: n/a
- Feeding
  - Explanation: Description of the feeding regime
  - Units: n/a
  - Notes: n/a
- Daily_Ingestion
  - Explanation: Amount of dry matter ingested by an animal per day
  - Units: kg dry matter per day
  - Notes: n/a
- Composition_Animal_Feed
  - Explanation: Equation for the weighted composition of the total diet
  - Units: n/a
  - Notes: Information about animal feed composition provided by producers
- Abbreviations
  - Explanation: Abbreviations are based on Sample Codes
  - Units: n/a
  - Notes: Related to sample code mappings

## Metadata and Data Quality Considerations
- Some fields carry n/a for Notes, indicating potential metadata gaps.
- Abbreviations rely on Sample Codes, necessitating clear mapping for interoperability.
- Data may require transformation to be readily usable in monitoring workflows.
- Composition data are provided by producers, underscoring the need for provenance and data governance.

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Enables tracking of animal feeding regimes and daily dry matter intake, which can inform environmental exposure and nutrient loading assessments.
- Supports indicators related to:
  - Ingestion rates by animal type and location
  - Contribution of animal feed composition to overall diet
- Can feed dashboards and reports used by authorities to evaluate policy impacts on livestock feeding practices and environmental health outcomes.

## Data Governance, Access, and Sharing
- Public sharing of underlying datasets is cited as a potential barrier, impacting transparency and reproducibility.
- Clear metadata, provenance, and standardized units are important to ensure data can be shared and reused across monitoring projects.
- Ensuring data quality, appropriate storage, and open access where appropriate will facilitate use in governance processes.

## Practical Considerations and Recommendations
- Establish a clear mapping for abbreviations to sample codes to improve interoperability.
- Where possible, enrich metadata beyond n/a notes to support reuse and verification.
- Align data formats and units with standard monitoring frameworks to minimize transformation effort.
