# Supporting documentation for 15-Animal_Feed_Stable.csv

## Overview
- Provides metadata for the dataset on stable element concentrations in total diet samples from animal feed.
- Captures general context (animal type, location, feeding regimes) and concentrations of multiple elements.
- Units are mg per kg of dry mass (mg/kg_dry_mass) for all element measurements.
- Indicates when concentrations are below detection limits and provides uncertainty (Unc_*) and detection limit (Detection_Limit_*) fields for each element.
- Some fields appear with multiple subfields (e.g., Na, Mg, etc.), suggesting multiple columns or versions in the source dataset.
- Targeted at ensuring data quality, provenance, and reuse across datasets managed by data stewards.

## Data Quality and Interpretations
- Detection limit fields indicate when a measurement is not detectable and flag below-detection-limit values.
- Uncertainty fields enable propagation of measurement error in analyses.
- Some entries show formatting inconsistencies or truncations (e.g., Na and Pb-related fields with multiple indices or missing values); these require standardization.
- All measurements pertain to the total diet on a dry mass basis, enabling cross-element comparisons.

## Governance and Sharing Considerations for Data Stewards
- These metadata fields support dataset discovery, interoperability, and proper reuse; align with established data standards and catalogs.
- Document spatial/temporal provenance (animal type, location, feeding regime) for traceability.
- Enforce consistent units and field naming; resolve multi-index subfields (e.g., Na, Pb, U, Th) into a clean, standardized schema.
- Establish rules for handling below-detection-limit data (e.g., masking, flagging, or imputation strategies).
- Capture data sharing constraints (embargoes, licensing) if applicable and ensure their representation in metadata.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
- Develop a unified data dictionary consolidating field names, units, and notes; remove formatting inconsistencies.
- Reconcile multi-subfield columns into a consistent schema with clear semantics.
- Validate and fill any missing metadata where possible, especially for detection limits and uncertainties.
- Update the dataset in data portals with standardized metadata to improve discoverability and reuse.
