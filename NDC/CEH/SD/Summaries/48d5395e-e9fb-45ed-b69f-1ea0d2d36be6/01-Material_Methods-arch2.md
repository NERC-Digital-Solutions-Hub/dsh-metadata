# Dataset on transfer of radionuclides/elements to foodstuffs in Spain.

## Aim and scope
- Provides a published dataset on the transfer of radionuclides and stable elements from soil to various foodstuffs in Spain.
- Deliverable D9.14 of the CONFIDENCE project; contributes to a published dataset on transfer in Mediterranean ecosystems.
- Supports environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessment through standardized transfer parameters.

## Sampling sites and foodstuffs
- Two sampling schemes in Spain:
  - Main production regions, focusing on areas with major production of each food.
  - Local sampling in a dehesa in Extremadura (Mediterranean semi-natural grassland with holm oaks).
- Foodstuff groups sampled:
  - Cereals: wheat, triticale, oats, barley.
  - Grapevine: plant, grapes, wine (Ronda, Piñel de Abajo; varieties Pinor noir, Tempranillo).
  - Olive: olives, olive leaves/branches, olive oil (Torreorgaz, Rociana del Condado).
  - Livestock: lamb, beef, pork (dehesa systems with varied feeding regimes).
  - Dairy products: sheep, goat, and cow milk; sheep/goat/cow cheeses, yogurt, kefir.
- Additional samples: soils (0–10 cm), wild grass, and animal feeds collected at each site.
- GPS coordinates recorded for sampling locations.

## Sampling and sample preparation
- Soil: composite samples created by combining at least six 0–10 cm samples per area.
- Wild grass: collected by hand; dominant species identified.
- Plant and animal products: whole plant parts ( cereals ), leaves/branches (grapevines, olives ), animal tissues (liver, kidney, meat), milk and dairy products, and wine/olive oil processed as described.
- Sample preparation methods:
  - ICP-MS analysis: oven-dried or lyophilized as appropriate; olive oil analysed directly.
  - Gamma spectrometry: composite soils calcined or dried; wines and oils prepared per matrix requirements.
- In all cases, precise sampling protocols ensured minimization of contamination and proper representation of each site.

## Laboratory analyses

### ICP-MS (elements and radionuclide tracers)
- Analytes: stable elements and radionuclides (Cs, Sr, U, Th, Pb, K, Ca, Na, Mg, P).
- Instrument: NexIon 350X ICP-MS with kinetic energy discrimination; protection against polyatomic interferences.
- Quality control: internal standards; calibration with multi- and single-element standards; use of certified reference materials; recoveries around 106%.
- Detection limits (approximate): Cs 0.0005 µg/L, Sr 0.03 µg/L, U 0.0004 µg/L, Th 0.009 µg/L, Pb 0.002 µg/L, others ranging up to 10 µg/L for K.

### Gamma spectrometry (radionuclides)
- Radionuclides analyzed after secular equilibrium (~21 days): 137Cs, 214Pb, 214Bi (equilibrium with 226Ra), 228Ac (equilibrium with 232Th series), 40K.
- 226Ra inferred from 214Pb/214Bi; 228Ac assumed in equilibrium with 228Ra (and with 232Th in soil).
- Instrument calibration with standardized multi-radionuclide sources; QA with IAEA reference materials; ISO/IEC 17025 accredited.

## Physico-chemical parameters of soils
- Measurements: pH (in water), electrical conductivity, soil texture (clay, sand fractions, silt by standard sedimentation), and organic matter content (via peroxide digestion and separation).
- Data used to contextualize element transfer and soil interactions.

## Calculation of transfer parameters
- Transfer factor for plants (Fv): plant concentration (Bq/kg dry mass) divided by soil 0–10 cm concentration (Bq/kg dry mass).
- Transfer factor to liquids (Fv, liquid foods like wine and olive oil): liquid food concentration (Bq/L or mg/L) divided by soil concentration (Bq/kg or mg/kg dry matter).
- Food product transfer to animals (CR): concentration in food product (fresh weight) divided by concentration in total diet (dry matter).
  - Diet composition information provided; wild grass intake estimated from daily dry matter intake in literature when needed.
  - If certain components were below detection and contributed <30% to diet, detection limits used for feed concentration; if >30%, results reported as “less than” values and some transfers not calculated.
- For milk (liquid): CR is concentration in milk (Bq/L or mg/L) divided by diet concentration (dry matter).
- Data handling aligns with IAEA TRS-472 (2010) for radionuclide transfer parameters.

## Data quality and standards
- Methods aligned with international standards (IAEA TRS-472; ISO/IEC 17025).
- Use of certified reference materials (IAEA, NPL) for validation; uncertainty estimates incorporate replicates, reference materials, and counting statistics.
- Daily instrument verification to ensure stable performance and accurate measurements.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy
- Provides standardized, traceable transfer parameters (Fv and CR) for Spain’s soils and diverse foodstuffs.
- Enables integration with other datasets to evaluate environmental radiological health and policy outcomes over time.
- Supports data-sharing goals by conforming to common methodologies and quality controls, with potential for broader accessibility and reuse.
