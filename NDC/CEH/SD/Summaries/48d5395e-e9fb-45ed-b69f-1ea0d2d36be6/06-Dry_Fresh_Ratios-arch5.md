# Supporting documentation for 06-Dry_Fresh_Ratios.csv

## Scope and purpose
- Provides metadata and explanations for the 06-Dry_Fresh_Ratios.csv dataset.
- Documents how dry-to-fresh mass ratios are described and stored across samples.

## Data fields and definitions
- Sample_Type
  - Explanation: General description of sample (e.g., foodstuff group)
  - Units: n/a
  - Notes: n/a
- Sample_Description
  - Explanation: Part of the organism analysed (e.g., where the whole organism was divided and analysed separately)
  - Units: n/a
  - Notes: n/a
- Mean_Value_Dry/Fresh_Ratio
  - Explanation: Mean value of the ratio between dry mass and fresh mass
  - Units: Unitless
  - Notes: n/a
- Min_Value_Dry/Fresh_Ratio
  - Explanation: Minimum value of the ratio between dry mass and fresh mass
  - Units: Unitless
  - Notes: n/a
- Max_Value_Dry/Fresh_Ratio
  - Explanation: Maximum value of the ratio between dry mass and fresh mass
  - Units: Unitless
  - Notes: n/a

## Data quality and governance considerations
- All ratio values are unitless; ensure consistent calculation and interpretation of mean, min, and max across samples.
- Verify completeness of Sample_Type and Sample_Description fields for each record.
- Maintain clear provenance and linkage between samples and their corresponding ratio statistics.

## Usage guidance for data stewards
- Use this metadata to validate and harmonize datasets sharing 06-Dry_Fresh_Ratios.csv.
- Ensure adherence to naming conventions and that unitless values are consistently represented.
- Document any data limitations, disclosures, or embargoes affecting Sample_Type or Sample_Description as needed.
