# Dataset on transfer of radionuclides/elements to foodstuffs in Spain.

- Purpose: A published dataset (Deliverable D9.14) of the CONFIDENCE project documenting transfer of radionuclides and stable elements from soil to a wide range of Spanish foodstuffs and derived products, following IAEA guidance (TRS-472).

## Sampling sites and foodstuffs
- Two sampling schemes:
  - Main production regions, targeting areas of major production per public agricultural information.
  - Local level sampling in a dehesa in Extremadura (Mediterranean semi-natural grassland with holm oaks).
- Food groups sampled:
  - Cereals (wheat, triticale, oats, barley)
  - Grapevine (grapes, leaves, branches; wine from some sites)
  - Olive (olives, leaves, branches; olive oil from mills/cooperatives)
  - Lamb, Beef, Pork (dehesa-raised; varying feeding regimes)
  - Dairy products (sheep, goat, cow milk; cheeses, yogurt, kefir)
- Associated matrices collected at each site: soil (0–10 cm), wild grass, and animal feeds.

## Sample collection and site documentation
- Precise GPS coordinates recorded for all sampling locations.
- Soil: composite samples created from at least 6 subsamples per site (0–10 cm).
- Wild grass: hand-cut, dominant species identified.
- Food and by-product sampling specifics varied by commodity (e.g., cereals separated into roots, stem, grain; grapes and wine; olives and oil; meat, liver, kidney from slaughterhouses).
- Animal diet information gathered from producers; meat and dairy samples collected post-slaughter; feeds also sampled.
- For dairy, milk and derived products collected from sheep, goats, and cows across multiple feeding regimes.

## Laboratory analyses and sample preparation
- ICP-MS for stable elements (Cs, Sr, U, Th, Pb, K, Ca, Na, Mg, P):
  - Microwave-assisted acid digestion (9:3:6 HNO3:HCl:HF) for soils; alternative digestion (HNO3:H2O2) for less matrix-heavy samples.
  - KED mode with helium collision for interferences; external calibration with internal standardization; recoveries around 106%.
  - Detection limits: Cs 0.0005 µg/L, Sr 0.03 µg/L, U 0.0004 µg/L, Th 0.009 µg/L, Pb 0.002 µg/L, and others (calculated with blanks).
- Gamma spectrometry for radionuclides (after ~21 days to reach equilibrium):
  - Radionuclides: 137Cs, 214Pb, 214Bi (226Ra in equilibrium), 228Ac (232Th series), 40K.
  - 226Ra and 228Ra inferred from their daughters; detectors calibrated with multi-nuclide cocktail; ISO17025 accreditation; IAEA reference materials used for QC.
  - Uncertainties calculated according to ISO11929.
- Physico-chemical soil parameters:
  - pH (in water), conductivity, texture (clay, sands, silt via standard sedimentation and sieving), and organic matter (via peroxide digestion and sedimentation).
- Sample processing specifics:
  - Soils: sieved, dried; cereals and other solids: oven-dried; grapes/wine/olives/dairy/meat: freeze-dried or measured fresh as appropriate; olive oil measured fresh.

## Transfer parameter calculations (IAEA TRS-472)
- Plant-to-soil transfer factor (Fv):
  - Fv = plant concentration (Bq/kg dry matter or mg/kg DM) / soil 0–10 cm concentration (Bq/kg DM or mg/kg DM).
- Liquid plant-derived foods transfer (Fv for liquids like wine and olive oil):
  - Fv (kg DM/L) = liquid food concentration (Bq/L or mg/L) / soil concentration (Bq/kg DM or mg/kg DM).
- Animal-derived foods: concentration ratio (CR):
  - CR = concentration in food product (fresh weight) / concentration in total diet (dry matter).
  - Diet composition used to estimate overall diet concentrations; wild grass intake estimated from literature to satisfy daily DM intake.
  - Handling nondetects:
    - If a feed’s contribution to the diet is <30%, use detection limits to estimate feed concentration.
    - If >30%, use detection limits but report as “less than”; in those cases, transfer parameters may not be determined.
- Milk (liquid) CR:
  - CR = milk concentration (Bq/L or mg/L) / diet concentration (dry matter).
- Diet data and transfer calculations follow IAEA TRS-472 recommendations.

## Data quality, uncertainty, and QA/QC
- Calibration and standards:
  - Use of internal standards and comprehensive calibration for ICP-MS; daily instrument checks with multi-element mixtures.
  - Certified reference materials (IAEA soils and organic material) used for validation; recovery and consistency monitored.
- Uncertainty:
  - Combined uncertainty (k=2) incorporating duplicates, reference materials, and counting variability.
- Documentation and integrity:
  - Measurements and quality controls aligned with ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation for radiochemical procedures.

## Outputs and dissemination
- Deliverable D9.14: Published dataset on transfer in Mediterranean ecosystems as part of the CONFIDENCE project; linked to broader CONCERT and Euratom initiatives.
- Data products enable comparison of soil-to-food transfer across a Mediterranean context and support risk assessment and policy input.
