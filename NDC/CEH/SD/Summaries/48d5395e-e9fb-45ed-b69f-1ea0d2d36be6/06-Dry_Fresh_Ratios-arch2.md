# Supporting documentation for 06-Dry_Fresh_Ratios.csv

## Overview
- Provides metadata guidance for a CSV dataset of dry-to-fresh mass ratios.
- Defines how each field should be described to enable consistent analysis and interpretation across samples.

## Field Descriptions

- Sample_Type
  - Explanation: General description of the sample (e.g., foodstuff group).
  - Units: n/a
  - Notes: n/a

- Sample_Description
  - Explanation: Part of the organism analysed (e.g., where the whole organism was divided and analysed separately).
  - Units: n/a
  - Notes: n/a

- Mean_Value_Dry/Fresh_Ratio
  - Explanation: Mean value of the ratio between dry mass and fresh mass.
  - Units: Unitless
  - Notes: n/a

- Min_Value_Dry/Fresh_Ratio
  - Explanation: Minimum value of the ratio between dry mass and fresh mass.
  - Units: Unitless
  - Notes: n/a

- Max_Value_Dry/Fresh_Ratio
  - Explanation: Maximum value of the ratio between dry mass and fresh mass.
  - Units: Unitless
  - Notes: n/a

## Data Units and Interpretation
- All ratio values are unitless, facilitating cross-sample comparisons.
- Each field includes an explicit explanation to ensure consistent understanding and reuse.

## Best Practices for Analysts
- Use standardized methods to calculate and report mean, minimum, and maximum dry-to-fresh mass ratios.
- Maintain clear and consistent Sample_Type and Sample_Description descriptors to support comparability across datasets.
- Leverage the explicit field explanations to ensure metadata quality and dataset interoperability.

## Data Management Implications
- The documentation supports reuse and integration of the 06-Dry_Fresh_Ratios.csv with other environmental monitoring data by providing structured, standardized field definitions.
