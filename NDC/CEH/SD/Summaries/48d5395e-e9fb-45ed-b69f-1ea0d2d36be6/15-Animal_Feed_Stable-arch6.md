## Data quality and interpretation notes
- Blank values indicate measurements at or below the detection limit for that metric.
- Uncertainty fields accompany concentration fields to enable uncertainty propagation in analyses.
- The Na, Pb, U, and Th sections show formatting irregularities in this documentation excerpt (e.g., additional markers or labels within the field descriptions). Users should verify field names and data types in the actual dataset to ensure correct parsing.
- The dataset captures multiple elements across potentially different animals, locations, and feeding regimes, enabling cross-group comparisons but requiring careful handling of non-detects and varying detection limits.

## How this documentation supports data products
- Helps build dashboards and reports on trace element content in animal feed, supporting risk assessment and policy/compliance tasks.
- Enables self-service analyses by providing clear definitions of each variable, units, and the meaning of non-detects.
- Supports proper uncertainty quantification by using the Unc_* fields in aggregations and summaries.
