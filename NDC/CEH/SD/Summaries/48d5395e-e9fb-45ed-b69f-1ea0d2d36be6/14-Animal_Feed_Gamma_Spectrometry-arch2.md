# Supporting documentation for 14-Animal_Feed_Gamma_Spectrometry.csv

## Purpose and scope
- Provides metadata definitions and explanations for the 14-Animal_Feed_Gamma_Spectrometry.csv dataset.
- Documents sample attributes (Animal, Location, Feeding) and radionuclide concentrations in the total diet on a dry mass basis.
- Ensures standardized data capture, quality assurance, and traceability for environmental monitoring outputs.

## Key fields and interpretation
- Animal
  - General type of animal; descriptive category for samples.
- Location
  - Name of the site where the sample was collected.
- Feeding
  - Description of the feeding regime for the animal/diet sampled.
- Ra-226_Bq/kg_dm
  - Activity concentration of Ra-226 in the total diet on a dry mass basis (Bq/kg_dm).
  - In equilibrium with Pb-214 and Bi-214.
  - Where blank, concentration was below the detection limit.
- Unc_Ra-226_Bq/kg_dm
  - Uncertainty (quadratic propagation) of Ra-226 activity concentration.
  - In equilibrium with Pb-214 and Bi-214.
- Detection_Limit_Ra-226_Bq/kg_dm
  - Detection limit for Ra-226 (Bq/kg_dm).
