# Supporting information for 'Q sort response data on stakeholder discourse and opinion towards a nonnative lizard species (Podarcis muralis)'

## Overview
- Describes the Q-methodology used to capture stakeholder discourses about nonnative wall lizards in the UK.
- Presents the raw Q sorts prior to any factor analysis.
- Combines qualitative discussion with structured ranking to reveal subjective viewpoints (discourses) on the topic.

## Q-set design and content
- The Q set was built from statements generated in response to the open question about opinions on wall lizards in the UK.
- Sources for statements:
  - Public responses gathered during a 2017 citizen science campaign (freepost surveys and media outreach).
  - Informal conversations with the public and land managers during ecological fieldwork (2016–2018).
  - Relevant opinions surfaced from extensive internet searches of non-scientific press and social media.
- Process:
  - Initially 128 statements collected.
  - Revised through piloting and expert input to 76 statements, maintaining plain language and broad coverage.
  - Several broadly negative statements about non-native species retained to balance broader views in academic literature.
- The 76 statements (Q statements) cover a range of sentiments from highly positive to strongly negative about wall lizards and their presence.

## Participants and sampling
- Total participants: 26 across seven stakeholder groups (summer 2017).
- Groups and sizes:
  - Land managers: 6
  - Public: 8
  - Environmental advisory group (invasive non-native species/biosecurity): 3
  - Reptile enthusiasts: 3
  - Ecological consultants: 2
  - Reptile conservation NGO representatives: 2
  - Academics (biosecurity and reptile ecology): 2
- Rationale: More participants in land manager and public groups to capture a wider range of experiences and opinions; participants recruited based on relevance to wall lizard introductions or general engagement with the topic.
- Briefing: All participants received background information about the non-native status of wall lizards; statements were not presented as scientific facts.

## Data collection procedures
- Q sort administration:
  - Conducted in person (13 participants) or online using Pruneddo software (13 participants).
  - Participants received the 76 statements in a deck of randomly numbered cards.
  - Initial sorting into three piles: identify/agree, neutral/undecided, and do not identify/disagree.
  - Final ranking on a fixed quasi-normal distribution from strongly disagree to strongly agree, requiring participants to position each statement relative to others.
  - Encouraged to adjust the placement to reflect their personal viewpoint.
  - In-person sorts included a follow-up discussion to elaborate on viewpoints and salient statements.
  - Online sorts were followed by discussion via email.
- Outcome: Each Q sort is paired with participant commentary to illuminate themes and any gaps in the Q set.

## Online vs in-person administration
- In-person: 13 sorts completed with the lead researcher present for discussion.
- Online: 13 sorts completed using Q-sort software; follow-ups conducted via email.
- Both modes used the same three-step process and final ranking distribution.

## Data analysis plan
- Q sorts are intended to be analyzed via factor analysis to identify distinct discourses or viewpoints.
- This document provides the raw Q sorts prior to any factor analysis, enabling replication or secondary analysis.
- The methodological framework and references underpinning Q methodology are cited.

## Q statements overview
- The 76 statements cover themes such as affection for wall lizards, perceived impacts on native species, ecological and conservation considerations, attitudes toward management and control, and views on coexistence versus eradication.
- Sentiments range from strong affinity and enjoyment to concerns about ecological impacts and calls for management or further study.
