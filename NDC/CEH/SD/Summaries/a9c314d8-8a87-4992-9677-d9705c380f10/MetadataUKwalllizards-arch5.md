# Supporting information for 'Q sort response data on stakeholder discourse and opinion towards a nonnative lizard species (Podarcis muralis)'

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents raw Q sort data collected for a study using Q methodology to explore stakeholder discourses and opinions toward Podarcis muralis (non-native wall lizards) in the UK.
  - Data are raw sorts required prior to factor analysis; intended to support identification of distinct discourses.

- Q-set design and content
  - Final Q set consists of 76 statements drawn from multiple sources responding to: “Do you have any thoughts or feelings about the presence of wall lizards in the UK?”
  - Sources include: public responses from a 2017 citizen science campaign, informal fieldwork conversations (2016–2018) with land managers/owners, and extensive online/non-scientific press material.
  - Processed from an initial 128 statements; underwent revision for clarity, consolidation, and balance of views; exceptionally broad statements retained to reflect general attitudes toward non-native species (NNS).
  - Full list of 76 statements is provided at the end of the document.

- Participants and sampling
  - 26 participants across seven stakeholder groups (summer 2017).
  - Groups and sizes:
    - Land managers (n=6)
    - Public (n=8)
    - Environmental advisory group (n=3)
    - Reptile enthusiasts (n=3)
    - Ecological consultants (n=2)
    - Reptile conservation NGO representatives (n=2)
    - Academics (n=2)
  - Rationale: larger participation in land manager and public groups to capture greater variation in experience and opinion.

- Data collection methodology
  - Modes: in-person (13 participants) and online (13 participants) using Pruneddo software (2013).
  - Procedure:
    - Each participant receives a deck of 76 statements (cards) and performs an initial triage into three piles: identify/agree, neutral/undecided, do not identify/disagree.
    - Participants then rank statements on a quasi-normal, fixed distribution scale from strongly disagree (-6) to strongly agree (+6), ensuring the entire set is ranked relative to one another.
    - Sorting is iterative with opportunities to rearrange statements to reflect personal viewpoints; follow-up discussion is conducted during the process to elicit salient themes and any missing perspectives.
    - For online sorts, participants drag-and-drop into the fixed distribution; follow-up discussions occur via email.
  - Data captured includes both the final Q-sort ranking and accompanying qualitative elaboration from discussions.

- Data structure and accompanying materials
  - Primary data: raw Q-sort rankings for each participant.
  - Additional materials: recorded or transcribed follow-up discussions where available, and verbatim Q statements with their assigned positions.
  - Q-set content (76 statements) and methodological description provide context for interpretation and future re-use.

- Data governance, quality, and documentation considerations
  - Data are designed to support reproducible analysis (factor analysis to identify discourses).
  - Documentation includes details on Q-set development, participant groups, data collection procedures, and software tools used.
  - Statements are contextualized to avoid treating them as scientific facts; participants were informed that items reflect viewpoints, not validated claims.
  - Consents were obtained, and no sensitive personal data beyond group affiliation and qualitative input are required for analysis.
  - To maximize reuse and discoverability, key metadata include: study topic, Q methodology approach, number of statements, number of participants, participant group labels, and data collection method.

- Q statements (76 items)
  - The document provides the complete list of 76 statements (items 1–76), representing a spectrum of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments toward wall lizards in the UK, including perceptions of aesthetics, ecological impact, native species competition, and personal enjoyment. Examples include statements such as:
    - Positive/accepting: "The wall lizards add to the character of our garden and village."; "It's nice to see wall lizards in the wild."
    - Cautious/concerned: "Wall lizards are invading the UK."; "I don't want wall lizards to damage native species."
    - Neutral/reflective: "No strong feelings about wall lizards one way or another."; "I would like to see some scientific studies investigating their impacts."
