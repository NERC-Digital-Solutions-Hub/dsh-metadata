# Supporting information for 'Q sort response data on stakeholder discourse and opinion towards a nonnative lizard species (Podarcis muralis)'

## Overview
- This document presents raw Q sort data collected to study stakeholder discourses on the presence of wall lizards in the UK.
- Q methodology: participants rank a set of statements (Q-set) to reveal subjective viewpoints; the resulting sorts are raw data prior to subsequent factor analysis to identify discourses.

## Q-set design and development
- Initial Q-set: 128 statements generated from multiple sources responding to “Do you have any thoughts or feelings about the presence of wall lizards in the UK?”.
- Sources include:
  - 2017 citizen science responses (freepost survey and media campaigns)
  - Informal conversations with the public and landowners/managers (2016–2018)
  - Internet/non-scientific press and social media forums
- Revision process to 76 statements:
  - Reduction and consolidation for plain language and coverage
  - Piloting and expert input (ecology and public engagement on non-native species)
  - Balance maintained between broadly positive/negative views, including broad NNS perspectives from literature
- Final Q-set: 76 statements, designed to comprehensively cover the study topic and provide balanced discourse coverage.

## Participants
- Total: 26 participants across 7 stakeholder groups (summer 2017)
  - Land managers: 6
  - Public: 8
  - Environmental advisory group: 3
  - Reptile enthusiasts: 3
  - Ecological consultants: 2
  - Reptile conservation NGO representatives: 2
  - Academics: 2
- Rationale: larger groups for land managers and public to capture greater variation; other groups smaller due to specialized knowledge.

## Data collection methodology
- Delivery: in person or online (software: Pruneddo)
- Procedure:
  - Step 1: Present 76 statements as a deck of randomly numbered cards; participants sort into three piles: identify/agree, neutral/undecided, do not identify/disagree.
  - Step 2: Rank statements on a fixed, quasi-normal distribution from strongly disagree (-6) to strongly agree (+6); participants refine placement to reflect their viewpoint.
  - Step 3: Interactive discussion with the researcher to elaborate on viewpoints and highlight salient statements; identify themes not represented.
- Online participants: used Q-sortware (Pruneddo); sorting mirrored the in-person process; follow-up discussions conducted via email.
- Background information provided: all participants were informed that the wall lizards are non-native in the UK; no scientific facts about consequences were given; statements represent viewpoints only.

## Content of Q statements (illustrative)
- The 76 statements cover a spectrum from strongly positive to strongly negative, including:
  - Positive/accepting: enjoyment of presence, viewing wall lizards as a local attraction, photography interest, etc.
  - Neutral/curious: recognition of uncertainty or unknown impacts.
  - Negative/concerned: invasiveness, competition with native species, potential ecological harm, and calls for control or study.
- Examples (representative, not exhaustive):
  - Positive: “Having a local colony of wall lizards is great.” “Wall lizards are a pleasure and a privilege to observe.” “Wall lizards add to the character of our garden and village.”
  - Negative: “Wall lizards invading the UK.” “I don’t want wall lizards to damage native species.” “We should stop wall lizards spreading if possible.”
- Note: The document includes full itemized Q statements (1–76) with a mix of near-pro and far-out sentiments toward non-native wall lizards.

## Data handling and next steps
- Data type: raw Q sorts collected from each participant before any factor analysis.
- Intended next step: factor analysis to identify distinct discourses/themes across participants.
- Qualitative follow-up: post-sort discussions provide context for interpretation of salient items and underlying discourses.
