# Supporting information for 'Q sort response data on stakeholder discourse and opinion towards a nonnative lizard species (Podarcis muralis)'

## Overview of the Q methodology
- All Q studies are reconstructive: data are collected as Q sorts (ranking statements from a personal viewpoint) and then factor-analysed to identify distinct discourses.
- The document provides the raw Q sorts prior to any factor analysis.

## Q-set design and development
- The Q set comprises 76 statements created from multiple sources in response to the question: "Do you have any thoughts or feelings about the presence of wall lizards in the UK?"
- Sources for statements:
  - Responses from the general public collected during a 2017 citizen science campaign (freepost survey and media engagement) to gather wall lizard sighting records.
  - Informal conversations with the public and landowners/managers during field work (2016–2018) in southern England.
  - Relevant statements found via extensive internet searches of non-scientific press and social media.
- Process:
  - Started with 128 statements; refined through rewriting, removal, consolidation, piloting, and expert input (ecology and public engagement on non-native species).
  - Negative opinions about non-native species were retained to balance the set with academic literature.
  - Final Q set: 76 statements, designed to provide comprehensive and balanced coverage of the topic.
- The Q statements span a range of views from positive acceptance and enjoyment to concerns about ecological impacts and policy responses.

## Participants and sampling
- 26 participants across seven stakeholder groups.
  - Land managers (n=6)
  - Public (n=8)
  - Environmental advisory group (n=3)
  - Reptile enthusiasts (n=3)
  - Ecological consultants (n=2)
  - Reptile conservation NGO representatives (n=2)
  - Academics (n=2)
- More participants were included in the land manager and public groups to capture greater variation in experience and opinion.
- All participants were given background information about the non-native status of wall lizards; statements were not presented as scientific facts.

## Data collection and process
- Administration modes:
  - In person (n=13) and online using Pruneddo Q-sort software (2013).
- Sorting procedure:
  - Step 1: Participants sort 76 cards into three piles: identify/agree, neutral/undecided, do not identify/disagree.
  - Step 2: Participants rank the statements on a fixed, quasi-normal distribution ranging from strongly disagree (-6) to strongly agree (+6). They adjust positions until the ranking reflects their viewpoint as closely as possible.
- Post-sort discussions:
  - In-person sorts were accompanied by discussions to elaborate viewpoints, highlight salient statements, and identify any missing themes.
  - Online sorts were followed up via email discussions.
- Data capture:
  - Some sorts were conducted in the presence of the lead researcher (n=13); others were completed online.

## Q statements (representative themes and examples)
- The 76 items cover a spectrum from strong support to strong opposition, including:
  - Positive/accepting: "The more wall lizards the merrier"; "Having a local colony of wall lizards is great"; "It's nice to see wall lizards in the wild"; "It's really nice to have this wildlife (wall lizards) in our garden."
  - Neutral/ambiguous: "Don't know how I feel about wall lizards being here"; "No strong feelings about wall lizards one way or another."
  - Negative/concerned: "These wall lizards are invading the UK"; "I don't want wall lizards to damage native species"; "I would feel quite privileged to have wall lizards in my garden" (balanced with caution in some contexts); "I don't want wall lizards killed."
- The statements also address ecological competition, effects on native species, climate/temperature considerations, and policy/management implications (e.g., containment, monitoring, and the balance between conservation goals and non-native introductions).

## Data usage and next steps
- The document presents raw Q sorts prior to factor analysis, which will be used to identify distinct stakeholder discourses.
- Outputs from the subsequent analysis are expected to be reports or visualizations (maps/charts) illustrating the discourses.
- Data management notes emphasize standardised presentation formats and storage/upload to appropriate data portals.
