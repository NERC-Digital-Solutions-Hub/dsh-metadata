# Supporting information for 'Q sort response data on stakeholder discourse and opinion towards a nonnative lizard species (Podarcis muralis)'

## Overview
- Documents the raw Q sorts used prior to factor analysis in a Q methodology study.
- Aims to capture subjective viewpoints (discourses) about the presence of wall lizards in the UK and prepare data for identifying patterns through factor analysis.

## Q-set design
- 128 initial statements were collected from:
  - Public responses to a 2017 citizen science campaign and media coverage
  - Informal conversations with the public and land managers during 2016–2018 field work
  - Internet/non-scientific press and social media discussions
- Refinement process reduced to 76 statements to ensure comprehensive, balanced coverage and plain language clarity.
- Several statements expressing broad anti-introduction sentiments were retained to balance with academic literature on non-native species.
- Final set is designed to reflect a range of attitudes toward nonnative species and wall lizards.

## Participants
- Total participants: 26 across seven stakeholder groups (summer 2017)
  - Land managers (n=6)
  - Public (n=8)
  - Environmental advisory group (n=3)
  - Reptile enthusiasts (n=3)
  - Ecological consultants (n=2)
  - Reptile conservation NGO representatives (n=2)
  - Academics (n=2)
- Groups chosen to maximise variation in experience and opinion; more participants were recruited from land managers and the public to capture broader perspectives.
- All participants received background on the non-native status of wall lizards; statements were not presented as scientific facts.

## Data collection methodology
- Mode: in-person or online (Pruneddo software, 2013)
- Procedure:
  - Step 1: Initial three-pile sorting (identify/agree; neutral/undecided; do not identify/disagree) to acclimate to statements.
  - Step 2: Final ranking on a quasi-normal distribution from strongly disagree (-6) to strongly agree (6), requiring relative ranking of all 76 items.
  - Step 3: Follow-up discussion with the researcher to elaborate viewpoints and themes.
- Online participants (n=13) used Q-sortware to drag-and-drop items into the fixed distribution; follow-up discussions via email.
- Thirteen participants were observed in-person during sorting.

## Q statements (content scope)
- Statements cover personal attitudes toward wall lizards, native vs. non-native dynamics, ecological impact, enjoyment, and policy/management implications.
- Range of sentiment from highly positive (e.g., enjoyment, fascination, photo opportunities) to cautionary or critical about non-native introductions and potential effects on native species.
- Items explicitly address conservation priorities, potential ecological disruption, climate considerations, and calls for action or more research.

## Practical notes for analysts
- Raw Q sorts (pre-factor analysis) are provided to enable replication and further modeling of discourses.
- A diverse, balanced set of statements is crucial to capture multiple viewpoints and avoid bias.
- The combination of Q sorting with qualitative discussion aids in interpreting the underlying discourses revealed by factor analysis.
