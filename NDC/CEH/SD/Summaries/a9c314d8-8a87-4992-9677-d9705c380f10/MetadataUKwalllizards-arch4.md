# Supporting information for 'Q sort response data on stakeholder discourse and opinion towards a nonnative lizard species (Podarcis muralis)'

## Overview of Q methodology
- Q studies reconstruct subjective viewpoints by having participants rank-order a set of statements (the Q-set) according to their personal perspective.
- The resulting Q sorts are then factor-analysed to identify distinct patterns or discourses.
- The document provides the raw Q sorts required before performing factor analysis.

## Q-set design
- Q-set developed from 128 statements drawn from:
  - Public responses to a 2017 citizen science campaign about wall lizard sightings.
  - Informal conversations with the public and landowners during fieldwork (2016–2018) in southern England.
  - Internet searches of non-scientific press and social media on the topic.
- Revision process reduced to a final set of 76 statements, ensuring plain language and balanced coverage of the topic.
- Some statements express broad, general views on non-native species (NNS) to balance topic-specific items.
- The 76 statements (Q statements) cover a range of attitudes from positive acceptance to concern about native species and ecological impacts.

## Participants and sampling
- 26 participants across 7 stakeholder groups participated in the Q sorts during summer 2017.
  - Land managers (n=6)
  - Public (n=8)
  - Environmental advisory group (n=3)
  - Reptile enthusiasts (n=3)
  - Ecological consultants (n=2)
  - Reptile conservation NGO representatives (n=2)
  - Academics (n=2)
- Participants were selected to reflect diverse perspectives and experiences related to wall lizards, with some groups larger to capture variability.

## Data collection procedure
- Administration modes: in person or online (software by Pruneddo).
- Sorting process:
  - Step 1: Participants sort statements into three piles: identify/agree, neutral/undecided, do not identify/disagree.
  - Step 2: Participants rank statements on a fixed, quasi-normal distribution from -6 (strongly disagree) to +6 (strongly agree), adjusting until representation of their viewpoint is satisfactory.
- Additional discussion:
  - In-person participants engaged in follow-up discussion with the researcher to elaborate on viewpoints and salient statements.
  - Online participants completed the same process with follow-up via email.
- Post-sort data collection includes notes from discussion to capture themes not explicitly represented in the Q-set.

## Data and analysis notes
- The raw Q sorts are provided prior to any factor analysis, enabling transparency and reproducibility.
- The approach is designed to uncover distinct stakeholder discourses through subsequent factor analysis.

## Q statements content (themes)
- Statements encompass:
  - Positive attitudes toward wall lizards (enjoyment, fascination, presence in gardens, etc.).
  - Acceptance and invocation of practical benefits (e.g., pest control, garden enjoyment).
  - Concerns about impacts on native species and ecosystems (competition, pathogens, conservation value).
  - Views on management, introduction history, and policy actions.
  - Reflections on climate factors, scientific study needs, and ethics of introductions.
  - Social and cultural dimensions (public interest, media discourse, and personal experiences).

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates a structured approach to capturing diverse stakeholder perspectives as data, with a clearly defined Q-set and participant recruitment strategy.
- Highlights data governance practices relevant to data leaders:
  - Documentation of data collection steps and sources for provenance.
  - Preservation of raw data prior to any transformation (factor analysis).
  - Explicit statement that Q statements are viewpoint-based, not scientific facts, supporting ethical data use.
- Emphasizes data quality and standardization:
  - Use of a fixed, quasi-normal ranking distribution to enable comparison across sorts.
  - Iterative refinement of statements to balance representation and clarity.
- Supports reproducibility and transparency:
  - Detailed methodology for both in-person and online data collection.
  - Transparent listing of statement origins and the final Q-set composition.
- Provides a model for stakeholder-centric data design:
  - Inclusion of multiple stakeholder groups to capture a range of discourses.
  - Combination of qualitative discussion with structured quantitative ranking to illuminate underlying viewpoints.
