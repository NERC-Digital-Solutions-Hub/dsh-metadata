# Q sort response data on stakeholder discourse and opinion towards a nonnative lizard species (Podarcis muralis)

- Overview
  - The document describes the supporting information for a Q-methodology study examining stakeholder discourse and opinions about the nonnative wall lizard in the UK.
  - Q studies are reconstructive: participants rank a set (Q-set) of statements to reveal subjective viewpoints; these sorted responses are then factor-analysed to identify distinct discourses.
  - This file provides the raw Q-sort data required before factor analysis.

- Q-set design
  - Origin of statements: generated from multiple sources in response to the open question about thoughts or feelings on wall lizards in the UK, including:
    - Public responses from a 2017 citizen science campaign and media coverage.
    - Informal conversations with the public and landowners/managers during field work (2016–2018).
    - Online/internet sources (non-scientific press and social media).
  - Process: started with 128 statements; refined through rewriting, removal, consolidation, piloting, and expert input to balance sentiment and plain language.
  - Outcome: final Q set consists of 76 statements that aim to cover the topic comprehensively and balance various viewpoints (including broadly negative and broad views on non-native species).
  - Notes: Q statements are provided at the end of the document.

- Participants
  - Total: 26 participants across seven stakeholder groups (summer 2017).
  - Groups and sizes:
    - Land managers (n=6)
    - Public (n=8)
    - Environmental advisory group (n=3)
    - Reptile enthusiasts (n=3)
    - Ecological consultants (n=2)
    - Reptile conservation NGO representatives (n=2)
    - Academics (2) with interests in biosecurity and reptile ecology
  - Sampling rationale: more participants in land manager and public groups to capture variation; all participants received background information about non-native status and were instructed that statements are not scientific facts.

- Data collection methodology
  - Modes: in-person or online (Q-sort software by Pruneddo, 2013).
  - Procedure:
    - Stage 1: Participants sort 76 statements into three piles: agree/identify, neutral/undecided, disagree/not identify.
    - Stage 2: Participants then rank statements on a fixed, quasi-normal distribution from -6 (strongly disagree) to +6 (strongly agree) to reflect their personal viewpoint. They can adjust positions to best represent their views.
    - In-person sessions included discussion with the researcher to elaborate on viewpoints and themes.
    - Online participants used the same process, with follow-up discussions via email.
  - Data: the document presents raw Q-sort data prior to factor analysis.

- Q statements (content overview)
  - The 76 statements cover a spectrum of attitudes toward wall lizards, including:
    - Personal enjoyment and garden/yard presence
    - Perceived impacts on native species and ecosystems
    - Conservation and management considerations
    - Perspectives on native vs. non-native species
    - Perceived threats, benefits, and the broader issue of species introductions
    - Public interest and opportunities for observation and photography
  - Examples (representative): approval or enthusiasm for wall lizards, concerns about ecological impact on native lizards, statements about conservation priorities, and views on management actions versus acceptance.
  - The full set, with all 76 items, is provided in the document’s Q statements section (numbered 1–76, with some formatting notes in the original text).

- References and methodology context
  - Cited works on Q methodology:
    - Watts & Stenner (2012) on Q methodology theory and interpretation
    - Hagan & Williams (2016) on perceiving biodiversity conservation
    - Pruneddo (2013) on Q-sort software and methodology
  - The document situates the Q-set design and analysis within established Q-method literature and practice.

- Relevance for GIS and data practice
  - The study exemplifies gathering qualitative, stakeholder-driven inputs that can inform spatial planning, policy engagement, and risk communication in GIS projects.
  - It demonstrates a replicable, transparent data collection workflow for capturing diverse stakeholder perspectives, which could be mapped or linked to spatial stakeholders, zoning, or conservation planning datasets.
  - The final analytical step (factor analysis to identify discourses) yields interpretable themes that can guide map-based communication and decision support for policy colleagues, clients, or the public.
