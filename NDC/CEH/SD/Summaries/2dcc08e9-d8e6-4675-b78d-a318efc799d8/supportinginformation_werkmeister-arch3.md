# SUPPORTING INFORMATION Temperature and humidity data supporting use of an in situ passive heating method, and associated whole tree responses, Cerrado, Brazil, 2020

- Overview
  - Documents data collected to evaluate a novel in situ passive heating method (whole-tree heating) for assessing daytime warming responses in Cerrado trees and shrubs.
  - Aims to support understanding of how whole individuals up to 2.5 m tall respond to ~3°C daytime warming.
  - Collaboration between University of Leeds (UK) and Universidade do Estado de Mato Grosso (Brazil).

- Experimental design and study organisms
  - Whole-tree heating structure (WTHS) prototypes:
    - Prototype: six-sided cube around a Davilla elliptica (2.4 m tall) to test functioning in a remote field setting.
    - Three additional four-sided WTHSs (S1–S3) around Cerrado shrubs Erythroxylum suberosum.
  - Heating target: daytime temperature increase of approximately 3°C inside the WTHS.
  - Focal individuals:
    - Davilla elliptica (prototype) for initial WTHS testing.
    - Erythroxylum suberosum shrubs for a short-term heating experiment.
  - Experimental design for E. suberosum:
    - Six individuals selected; three designated as treatment (T1–T3) and three as controls (C1–C3).
    - Measurements taken on the first morning before heating (baseline) and then across weeks 1–3 after heating commenced.
    - Repeated measurements on each tree: days 0, 7, 14, 21 (note: one respiration measurement was removed due to wind damage).
  - Measurement focus:
    - Photosynthesis and dark respiration response curves across leaf temperature ranges.

- Microclimate data collection
  - Sensor setup:
    - Temperature and relative humidity (RH) recorded every minute with DTH22 sensors inside shields; above-crown sensor inside each WTHS center; ambient readings from a nearby control individual.
    - Ambient solar irradiance and environmental conditions monitored by a nearby WatchDog weather station.
  - Timeframe:
    - Prototype: 9–27 June 2020.
    - WTHS around E. suberosum (S1–S3): 4 August–23 August 2020 (plus 24–25 August data for S3).
  - Data handling:
    - Data from WTHS-open periods (testing) excluded from analyses.
  - Data outputs:
    - Continuous microclimate data to quantify internal WTHS conditions versus ambient environment.

- Photosynthesis and respiration measurements
  - Instrumentation:
    - Two LI-6400XT portable photosynthesis systems (one with a fluorometer chamber, one with an LED chamber).
    - Measurements conducted on one healthy, fully expanded leaf per leaf per plant per day (two leaves per individual per day).
  - Measurement protocol:
    - Leaves acclimated, photosynthesis measured under 1100 µmol m−2 s−1 light; respiration measured in darkness.
    - CO2 concentration maintained at 400 ppm; RH at 50% for all measurements.
    - Temperature steps: 20°C to 50°C in 10 increments with full equilibration at each step.
    - Temperature control:
      - Photosynthesis: leaf temperature raised via active heating (water jackets) to exceed 40°C as needed.
      - Respiration: leaves kept in darkness for at least 40 minutes prior to testing.
  - Timing:
    - Daily measurements conducted between 08:00–11:30 hours.
  - Data collected:
    - Leaf temperature, photosynthesis rate, and respiration rate across temperature range.

  - Structure and naming:
    - Structure labels include Prototype, S1, S2, S3 to distinguish different WTHS configurations and monitored individuals.
  - Metadata and data quality:
    - Sensor calibration performed against known steady temperatures and cross-sensor comparisons.
    - Data screening removed anomalous readings; leaves were photographed and health-checked before/after analyses.

- Quality assurance and governance
  - Emphasis on careful data collection, calibration, and health assessment to ensure reliability of microclimate and plant physiological measurements.
  - Data curated to support the methodology of in situ passive heating and to enable replication and re-use.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a structured approach to designing in situ environmental manipulation experiments and capturing high-resolution microclimate alongside physiological responses.
  - Provides explicit data schemas, column definitions, units, and temporal sequencing that support metadata-driven data governance, sharing, and reproducibility.
  - Highlights practical considerations for data access, metadata completeness, and potential barriers (e.g., data sharing, metadata gaps) relevant to monitoring framework development and implementation.
