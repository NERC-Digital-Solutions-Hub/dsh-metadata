# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Purpose and use
- Box and whisker plots provide a visual check of the quality of the LOCAR data.
- They help interpret the distribution: where data lie relative to the median, spread, and presence of outliers.

## Reading the plot
- Y axis: number line relevant to the units of the determinand.
- X axis: different sites; site IDs label the sites.
- Red line: median.
- Box edges: Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).

## Whiskers and outliers
- Lower whisker = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR; upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
- IQR = Q3 − Q1.
- Observations outside the whiskers are outliers.

## Interpretation and use
- Enables assessment of distribution shape, data quality, and cross-site comparison.
- Helps identify data gaps, unusual values, and informs data cleaning and quality checks.
- Useful for evaluating data readiness and informing downstream analyses and governance.
