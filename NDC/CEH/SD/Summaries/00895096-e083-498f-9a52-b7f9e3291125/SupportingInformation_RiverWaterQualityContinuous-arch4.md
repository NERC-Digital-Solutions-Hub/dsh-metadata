# Continuous measurements of conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and water level in rivers (2002-2007) [LOCAR]
LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Long-term continuous river water quality and level data (2002–2007) from LOCAR programme.
- 23 sites across Frome and Piddle, Pang and Lambourn, and Tern catchments.
- Variables: conductivity (25°C, uS/cm), dissolved oxygen (% saturation), pH, water temperature (°C), and water level (mm).
- Data are co-located with Environment Agency monitoring sites; some align with NRFA registrations.

## What was measured
- Conductivity (continuous, 25°C)
- Dissolved oxygen (continuous, % saturation)
- pH (continuous)
- Temperature (water)
- Water level (continuous)

## Where and when
- Sites: Bere, Bovington, Devils Brook, Frome, Piddle, Sydling Water, Hooke, Lambourn, Pang, Tern catchments; site codes include FP01–FP26, PL09, PL15, PL17–PL20, TE03, TE05, TE09, TE16, TE20, TE22, etc.
- Locations often correspond to EA monitoring sites; some NRFA station mappings provided.
- Measurement interval: every 15 minutes.
- Period: 2002–2007 (variable lengths per site).

## How measured (devices and sensors)
- Water quality: YSI 6-Series multi-parameter sondes with sensors for temperature, pH, conductivity, and DO.
  - Temperature: thermistor; range -5 to 45°C; ±0.15°C; 0.01°C resolution.
  - pH: glass electrode; range 0–14; ±0.2 pH units; 0.01 pH resolution.
  - Conductivity: 4 nickel electrodes; 0–100 mS/cm; ±0.5% of reading plus 0.001 mS/cm; 0.001–0.1 mS/cm resolution.
  - DO: rapid pulse - Clark type; 0–500% saturation; accuracy up to ±2% of reading or ±2% air saturation (whichever greater) up to 200%; ±6% beyond.
- Water level: Druck PDCR 1830 pressure transducers; 0.75–600 mH2O range; ±0.06% accuracy; titanium construction; surge arrestor.

## Data collection, calibration, and maintenance
- Maintenance team: Catchment Service Team installed, maintained, and downloaded loggers/transducers at sites.
- Calibration and maintenance:
  - Pre-deployment: lab checks, cleaning, oxygen membrane replacement, calibration.
  - DO calibration: saturate membrane in moist atmosphere; use barometric pressure input (760); calibrate to 100% air saturation.
  - Conductivity calibration: use standard conductivity solution (≈1413 µS) and input value; rinse between steps.
  - pH calibration: use pH 7 and pH 10 buffers; follow standard calibration sequence.
  - Post-field calibration: verify DO, conductivity, and pH values; record post-calibration values.
- Cleaning procedures: clean sonde exterior, remove mud, sanitize membranes, handle oxygen electrode carefully; conditioning time required for oxygen membrane.
- Data handling: raw data collected and stored; no quality control or correction for instrument drift or failures applied within this dataset.

## Data quality and interpretation
- Data are raw and not quality-controlled; not corrected for instrument drift or failures.
- Normal ranges (per Chapman 1996) used for reference:
  - Temperature: 0–30°C
  - pH: 6.0–8.5
  - Conductivity: 10–1000 µS/cm
  - DO: 0–20 mg/L
- QA observations (senior scientist-reviewed):
  - Substantial scatter; some periods appear implausible.
  - Battery level (<10 V) indicates potentially unreliable data for other parameters.
  - DO values >200% or very low DO are possible but unlikely; pH values outside 1–14 defined by chemistry; values >11 or <4 may be unreliable.
  - Temperature generally reasonable; extreme values warrant investigation.
  - Conductivity and water level are highly site-specific; typical conductivity 200–1200 µS/cm.
- Visual QA: box-and-whisker plots generated to show range, median, quartiles, and outliers.
