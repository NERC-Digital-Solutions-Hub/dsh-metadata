# Continuous   measurements   of   conductivity,   dissolved   oxygen,   pH, temperature and water level in rivers (20022007) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

- Overview
  - LOCAR baseline dataset documenting continuous river measurements to characterize water quality and hydrology from 2002 to 2007.
  - 23 sites across the Frome and Piddle, Pang and Lambourn, and Tern catchments; data co-located with Environment Agency monitoring sites and NRFA stations where applicable.

- Data collection details
  - Variables measured: conductivity (25°C, uS/cm), dissolved oxygen (% saturation), pH, temperature (°C), water level (mm).
  - Measurement frequency: data logged continuously at 15-minute intervals.
  - Instrumentation:
    - YSI 6-Series multiparameter sondes for water quality (temperature, pH, conductivity, DO).
    - Druck Pressure Transducers (PDCR 1830) for water level.
  - Site information:
    - Catchment tags FP (Frome/Piddle), PL (Pang/Lambourn), TE (Tern).
    - Example sites include Bere Stream at Snatford Bridge (FP01), Frome at East Stoke (FP11), Pang at Bucklebury (PL17), and the dual-site location TE05/TE22 at Ternhill.
    - TE05 and TE22 were located at the same site.
  - Data period: 2002–2007, with 15-minute interval measurements.

- Calibration and maintenance
  - Pre-deployment: sondes calibrated in the laboratory after two weeks in the river; cleaning and membrane maintenance performed; DO membrane replacement; moisture maintained during transport.
  - Calibration procedures:
    - Dissolved Oxygen: calibrate to 100% air saturation after ~10–60 seconds in a moist calibration setup; record barometric pressure and DO changes.
    - Conductivity: calibrate with a standard Conductivity Solution; input known conductance value.
    - pH: calibrate with pH 7 and pH 10 buffers.
  - Post-field checks: calibration software used to record post-calibration values for conductance, DO, and pH; sondes cleaned and stored properly.
  - Maintenance responsibility: Catchment Service Team at each site.

- Data quality and interpretation
  - Data are raw and not quality controlled for instrument failure or drift.
  - Normal ranges (Chapman 1996) used as reference guidelines:
    - Temperature: 0–30°C (field typical 5–25°C).
    - pH: 6.0–8.5 (extreme values >11 or <4 suspected as unreliable).
    - Conductivity: 10–1000 µS/cm (site-specific variation expected).
    - DO: 0–20 mg/L (DO readings >200% can occur but are unlikely).
  - Box-and-whisker plots generated to show range, median, quartiles, and outliers.
  - Key data quality notes:
    - Substantial scatter in determinands; some periods yield nonsensical values.
    - Battery level below 10 V indicates unreliable data for all parameters.
    - Temperature and other parameters sometimes fall outside expected ranges, requiring investigation.
    - Site-specific conductivity and water level vary; interpretation should consider local context.
  - Overall, data require cleaning and quality assurance before use in analyses.

- Data management and accessibility
  - Data sources tracked; datasets prepared with metadata to support discoverability.
  - Data may be uploaded to portals to make datasets discoverable and usable by others.

- Roles and collaboration
  - Field installation, maintenance, and data downloads conducted by the Catchment Service Team for each catchment.
