# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS

- Purpose: Box and whisker plots are used to visually check the quality of LOCAR data and to interpret the distribution of the data.

- What the plot shows:
  - Y axis: number line aligned with the units of the determinand.
  - X axis: different sites where the determinand was measured (site IDs represent sites).
  - Red line: median.
  - Box edges: Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).
  - Whiskers: lower whisker = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR; upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
  - IQR: Q3 − Q1.
  - Outliers: values plotting outside the whiskers.

- Key concepts:
  - IQR is the interquartile range (difference between Q3 and Q1).
  - Outliers are data points beyond the whiskers.

- Context and utility:
  - Used to aid interpretation of data distribution across sites and to assess data quality.
  - The description references a diagram illustrating the concept.
