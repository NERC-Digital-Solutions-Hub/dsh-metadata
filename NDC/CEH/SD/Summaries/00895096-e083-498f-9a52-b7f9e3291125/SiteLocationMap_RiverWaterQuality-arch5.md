# PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RIVER WATER QUALITY SITE (LCWQ)

## Overview
- Dataset focusing on a river water quality site within the Pang Lambourn catchment, identified under LCWQ.
- Aims to support monitoring, reporting, and management of river water quality; intended for use by researchers, managers, and regulators.

## Data Scope and Purpose
- Provides spatial and temporal measurements of water quality at the site.
- Supports assessment of water quality trends, compliance, and catchment health.

## Metadata, Standards and Formats
- Required metadata: site name, precise coordinates, catchment context, sampling methods, variables measured, units, sampling frequency, data provider, and provenance.
- Typical variables include pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, temperature, nitrates, phosphates, and other key water-quality indicators.
- Data formats: common time-series formats such as CSV or NetCDF; interoperability with LCWQ data standards and standard vocabularies.
- Ensure consistent use of coordinate reference systems and units; align with LCWQ metadata schemas.

## Data Availability, Access, and Sharing
- Define licensing (e.g., open data) and any access restrictions or embargo periods.
- Document data sharing arrangements, attribution requirements, and reuse conditions.
- Upload and link datasets to relevant portals and LCWQ catalogues; maintain discoverability.

## Quality Assurance and Transformations
- Implement QA checks on measurements (range checks, sensor calibration validation, outlier detection).
- Clean and transform data for shareable formats; retain original raw data with provenance.
- Document all transformations and quality flags to support traceability.

## Update, Maintenance, and Provenance
- Establish data update cadence (e.g., real-time, daily, or periodic) and versioning.
- Maintain provenance records indicating data sources, collection methods, and any prior edits.
- Plan for metadata updates when site characteristics or sampling protocols change.

## Governance, Roles, and Stakeholders
- Data stewards to oversee standards compliance, metadata completeness, and data sharing practices.
- Data creators/sharers responsible for initial data capture and quality checks.
- End users (researchers, managers, regulators) rely on the dataset for decision-making and reporting.

## Key Challenges and Risks
- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities.
- Delays in data delivery from collaborators or field teams.
- Ensuring metadata completeness and consistency across datasets.
- Managing diverse systems and formats; potential large data volumes.
- Handling outdated databases or bespoke, non-interoperable workflows.
- Navigating data embargoes or proprietary restrictions.

## Next Steps and Considerations for Data Stewards
- Confirm user needs and use cases to tailor metadata and data delivery.
- Establish clear data transfer protocols and timelines with data providers.
- Define and adopt standard metadata schema, units, and variable naming conventions.
- Set up QA procedures and documentation to accompany the LCWQ dataset.
- Ensure licensing, access policies, and embargo terms are established and communicated.
