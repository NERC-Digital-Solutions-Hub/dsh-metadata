# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS

## Introduction
- Box and whisker plots display the range, median, and quartiles of a dataset.
- They are typically drawn with a number line (horizontal or vertical).
- Purpose: provide a visual check of data quality and help interpret the distribution.
- They indicate where most data lie (within the box), the length of the whiskers, and whether there are outliers.

## Description
- The LOCAR box and whisker plots use a y-axis representing the determinand units and an x-axis representing the different measurement sites (site IDs).
- The red line inside the box represents the median.
- The box edges represent Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).
- Whiskers are calculated as:
  - Lower whisker = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR
  - Upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
- IQR (interquartile range) = Q3 − Q1.
- Data points outside the whiskers are considered outliers.
- A diagram illustrating the concept is referenced below.
