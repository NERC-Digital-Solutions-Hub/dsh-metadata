# PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RIVER WATER QUALITY SITE (LCWQ)

- Overview
  - A data-focused site/project centered on river water quality within the Pang Lambourn catchment (LCWQ).

- Alignment with Data Support aims
  - Understand the ask: determine data needs and why they matter for monitoring catchment water quality.
  - Data sourcing: identify and verify relevant data sources; collaborate with topic experts as needed.
  - Data preparation: quality assure, clean, and transform data; handle multiple formats and patchy datasets; integrate datasets for a coherent view.
  - Analysis: examine patterns and features in water quality over time to identify significant trends.
  - Outputs and self-service: create data products (e.g., dashboards, pivot tables) and accompanying guidance to enable end users to explore the data themselves.
  - Dissemination: promote outputs and gather feedback; iterate on products; consider sharing early prototypes.
  - Data improvement: advocate for better data creation and governance to support ongoing monitoring. 

- Potential data products and outputs (typical for LCWQ-type work)
  - Time-series dashboards showing key water quality indicators
  - Self-serve analytics (pivot tables, filters by location/time)
  - Regular reports and charts summarizing trends and anomalies
  - Metadata and data dictionaries to support reuse and understanding

- Data challenges to anticipate
  - Patchy or incomplete time-series data across stations
  - Data in diverse formats and from multiple systems
  - Communicating complex water quality information in accessible terms
  - Encouraging broad sharing and reuse of outputs among stakeholders
