# PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RIVER WATER QUALITY SITE (LCWQ)

- Overview
  - GIS data product representing a river water quality site within the Pang Lambourn catchment (LCWQ).

- Data Content and Structure
  - Likely contains a spatial point location for the water quality site.
  - Associated attributes related to water quality metrics and observations (specifics not provided).

- GIS Visualization and Use
  - Supports map-based visualization of water quality within the Pang Lambourn catchment.
  - Enables exploration of spatial relationships with catchment boundaries, hydrology layers, and other GIS data.

- Data Quality, Standards, and Integration (aligned with common GIS practices)
  - Data may come from multiple sources; verify provenance and harmonize data.
  - Clean and transform data; address missing values and inconsistencies.
  - Standardize units, schemas, and resolutions to facilitate integration with other layers.
  - Package large or complex datasets into manageable components for end users.

- Stakeholders and End-Users
  - Target audiences include policy colleagues, clients, and the public.
  - Use cases: decision support, reporting, and communication of water quality information through maps.

- End-User Engagement and Iteration
  - Test early prototypes with end users; iterate based on feedback.

- Suggested Next Steps for GIS Teams
  - Identify and document data sources for water quality measurements and catchment boundaries.
  - Create/curate spatial layers: catchment boundary, river network, and the LCWQ site point with relevant attributes.
  - Define a clear data schema, units, and QA checks; implement data cleaning workflows.
  - Develop initial map visualizations and prototypes; incorporate user feedback to refine presentation.
