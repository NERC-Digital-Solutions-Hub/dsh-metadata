# PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RIVER WATER QUALITY SITE (LCWQ)

- Overview
  - Identifies a specific river water quality monitoring site within the Pang Lambourn Catchment.
  - The site is designated as LCWQ, implying a focus on measuring river water quality at this location.
  - The text provides no details on measured parameters, sampling frequency, or data availability.

- Key implications for data analysis
  - The site likely serves as a source of time-series water quality data for analysis, trend detection, and potential correlations with catchment factors.
  - Requires collating metadata and ensuring correct geographic scope (catchment boundaries and site coordinates).

- Data considerations for an analyst
  - Identify and access LCWQ data sources and accompanying metadata (parameters, units, sampling schedule, QA/QC flags).
  - Assess data completeness, gaps, and continuity at local scale; plan for gap-filling or imputation if needed.
  - Standardize data from LCWQ with other datasets (e.g., land use, hydrology) to enable integrated analyses.

- Suggested next steps
  - Retrieve LCWQ dataset details: parameters measured (e.g., nutrients, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity), time range, and sampling cadence.
  - Validate data provenance and versioning; document data sources and transformations.
  - Prepare initial analyses: time-series plots, seasonality checks, and baseline trend assessments; explore potential correlations with catchment characteristics.
