# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

- Introduction
  - Box and whisker plots display the range, median, and quartiles of a dataset.
  - They are used to provide a visual check of data quality and to help interpret the distribution.
  - They help answer questions like how many data fall within the interquartile range (Q1 to Q3), the length of the whiskers, and how many points are outliers.

- Description
  - Axes: the y-axis shows the determinand units; the x-axis shows the different sites, with site IDs representing each site.
  - Box and median: the red line inside the box indicates the median; the box edges represent Q1 (lower quartile) and Q3 (upper quartile).
  - IQR: the interquartile range (IQR) is Q3 minus Q1.
  - Whiskers: lower whisker = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR; upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
  - Outliers: data points outside the whiskers are considered outliers.
  - The description notes that the diagram illustrates these components.
