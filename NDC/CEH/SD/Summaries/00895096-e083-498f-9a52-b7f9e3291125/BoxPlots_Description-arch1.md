# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Box and whisker plots display the range, median, and quartiles of a dataset.
- Used as a visual check of data quality and to interpret the data distribution.
- Help evaluate how much data lies within the central box, the length of the whiskers, and the presence of outliers.

## Plot Description for LOCAR
- Y-axis: number line relevant to the units of the determinand being displayed.
- X-axis: different sites where the determinand was measured; sites are represented by Site IDs.
- The red line inside the box: the median.
- The box edges: Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).

## Whiskers and Outliers
- Lower whisker = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR; upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
- IQR (interquartile range) = Q3 − Q1.
- Data points outside the whiskers are outliers.

## How to Interpret
- Assess distribution by looking at how data are spread within the box (Q1–Q3), whisker length, and the presence of outliers.
- Use box and whisker plots to visually check the quality and characteristics of LOCAR baseline datasets across sites.

## Additional Notes
- The document references a diagram illustrating these concepts.
