# Continuous measurements of conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and water level in rivers (2002-2007) [LOCAR]

## Overview
- LOCAR baseline datasets comprising continuous river measurements across 23 sites in three catchments: Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern, collected from 2002 to 2007.
- Data were recorded at 15-minute intervals and co-located with Environment Agency monitoring sites; some sites align with NRFA registered stations.

## What was measured
- Conductivity at 25°C (microsiemens per centimetre, uS/cm)
- Dissolved oxygen (percentage of saturation, %sat)
- pH (pH units)
- Water temperature (°C)
- Water level (millimetres, mm)

## Where and when
- Measurements taken at 23 LOCAR water quality sampling sites within designated catchments.
- Data collected continuously at 15-minute intervals between 2002 and 2007.

## Instruments and measurement details
- Water quality: YSI 6-Series multi-parameter sondes with:
  - Temperature: thermistor (range -5 to 45°C; accuracy ±0.15°C; resolution 0.01°C)
  - pH: glass electrode (range 0–14; accuracy ±0.2; resolution 0.01)
  - Conductivity: nickel electrode cell (0–100 mS/cm; accuracy ±0.5% of reading + 0.001 mS/cm; resolution 0.001–0.1 mS/cm)
  - Dissolved oxygen: rapid pulse Clark-type electrode (0–500% saturation; accuracy 0–200%: ±2% or 2% of air saturation, whichever is greater; 200–500%: ±6%)
- Water level: Druck P/T PDCR 1830 pressure transducers (0.75 mH2O to 600 mH2O; accuracy ±0.06%)
- Site naming includes codes such as FP01, FP11, FP12, FP15, FP21–FP23, FP26, FP31, PL09, PL15, PL17–PL19, PL20, TE03, TE05, TE09, TE16, TE20, TE22, with TE05 and TE22 at the same location (Figure 1 reference).

## Calibration, maintenance and data handling
- Maintenance: Catchment Service Teams installed, maintained, and downloaded loggers at regular intervals.
- Calibration and maintenance workflow:
  - After two weeks in-river deployment, sondes returned to the lab for calibration checks, cleaning, membrane replacement for the oxygen electrode, and recalibration; storage kept moist.
  - Pre-deployment calibration sequence included DO, conductivity, and pH calibrations via the sonde software.
  - DO calibration involved saturating the membrane with water vapour, entering barometric pressure, and confirming 100% air saturation after ~60 seconds.
  - Conductivity calibration used a 1413 µS standard; pH calibrations used buffers pH 7 and pH 10.
  - Field and post-field calibration steps repeated, with cleaning and rinsing between steps.
- Post-deployment checks: laboratory re-calibration to record post-calibration values for specific conductance, conductivity, and DO.
- Storage and handling: sondes cleaned, membranes replaced as needed; transportation pots kept moist; calibration solutions refreshed for each use.

## Data quality and interpretation
- Data are raw and have not been quality controlled or corrected for instrument failure or drift.
- Normal ranges ( Chapman 1996 ) referenced for context:
  - Temperature: 0–30°C
  - pH: 6.0–8.5
  - Conductivity: 10–1000 µS/cm
  - Dissolved Oxygen: 0–20 mg/L
- QA observations (from box-and-whisker plots reviewed by a senior water quality scientist):
  - Widespread scatter with occasional implausible values.
  - Battery level below 10 V associated with unreliable readings for other parameters.
  - DO values >200% likely erroneous; DO values near zero unusual but possible.
  - pH values outside 1–14; values >11 or <4 flagged as potentially unreliable.
  - Temperature values outside 5–25°C warrant investigation, though many are acceptable.
  - Conductivity and water level vary by site; values must be interpreted within site context.

## Data governance, metadata and accessibility
- Metadata detail includes site codes, catchment affiliations, NRFA station associations, and instrument specifications, supporting traceability and reuse.
- Data governance considerations highlighted by the documentation include the need to manage data provenance, quality flags, and transparency about raw versus processed data for policy scrutiny and decision-making.
