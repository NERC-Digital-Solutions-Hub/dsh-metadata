# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

- Introduction
  - A box and whisker plot displays the range, the median, and the quartiles of a dataset.
  - Usually drawn with a number line (horizontal or vertical).
  - For LOCAR data, the plots provide a visual check of data quality and help interpret the data distribution.
  - They indicate whether most data fall within the box (Q1–Q3) and how long the whiskers are, including how many points are outliers.

- Description
  - The y-axis shows the number line relevant to the units of the determinand.
  - The x-axis shows the different sites where the determinand was measured; site IDs represent sites.
  - The red line inside the box represents the median.
  - The edges of the box represent Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).
  - Whiskers are calculated as:
    - Lower whisker: Q1 − 1.5 × IQR
    - Upper whisker: Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
  - IQR (interquartile range) = Q3 − Q1.
  - Values outside the whiskers are outliers.
