# Supporting Document Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Blelham Tarn 2019 to 2020.

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring dataset from Blelham Tarn, Cumbria, England.
- Fortnightly sampling from January 2019 to end of 2020.
- Measured variables: surface temperature (TEMP), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG), Secchi depth (SECC), alkalinity (ALKA), pH, ammonium (NH4N), nitrate (NO3N), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P), total phosphorus (TOTP), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA).

## Sampling regime and methods
- Water samples integrated from 0 to 5 m.
- Measurements taken from a boat at the deepest part of the lake (buoy). If buoy access was not possible, samples from the shore were collected.
- Sampling frequency: fortnightly.

## Data included and units
- TEMP: degrees Celsius (°C)
- OXYG: percent air-saturation (%)
- SECC: metres (m)
- ALKA: micrograms per litre (µg CaCO3 per L)
- pH: unitless
- NH4N: µg N per L
- NO3N: µg N per L
- PO4P: µg P per L
- TOTP: µg P per L
- SIO2: µg per L
- TOCA: µg per L

## Data structure and metadata
- Format: CSV
- Columns: Date, Variable, Description, Value, Sign (if<LOD), Flag
- Sign (if<LOD): indicates values below detection limit with a "<" sign
- Flag: 1 = sample collected at buoy location; 2 = shore sample (buoy visit not possible)

## Data quality and limitations
- Raw data have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data attributed to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Access and context
- Data available to download as part of a long-term monitoring dataset; description notes raw data status and collection details.

## Funding and provenance
- Funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) grant NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
