- Overview
  - Long-term monitoring dataset from Blelham Tarn, Cumbria, England.
  - Fortnightly sampling from 2019 to 2020.
  - Variables include surface temperature, surface oxygen saturation, Secchi depth, alkalinity, pH, ammonium, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphate, total phosphorus, dissolved reactive silicon, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a.

- Measured variables and units
  - TEMP: surface temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)
  - OXYG: surface oxygen saturation (% air-saturation)
  - SECC: Secchi depth in metres
  - ALKA: alkalinity in µg CaCO3 per litre
  - pH: pH value
  - NH4N: ammonium in µg N per litre
  - NO3N: nitrate in µg N per litre
  - PO4P: soluble reactive phosphate in µg P per litre
  - TOTP: total phosphorus in µg P per litre
  - SIO2: dissolved reactive silicon in µg per litre
  - TOCA: phytoplankton chlorophyll a in µg per litre
  - Water samples integrated from 0 to 5 m; sampling from boat at the deepest buoy location, with shore sampling when buoy access was not possible.

- Sampling regime and collection methods
  - Part of an ongoing long-term monitoring program.
  - Data collected from January 2019 to end of 2020.
  - When buoy sampling was not feasible, samples were taken from the shore; some occasions lacked integrated water samples (Flag 2).

- Data quality and processing
  - Data provided are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
  - Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
  - Missing data attributed to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

- Data structure and format
  - Provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
  - Columns include:
    - Date: measurement date
    - Variable: name of the measured parameter
    - Value: measured value for each variable
    - Sign (if<LOD): indicates values below detection limit with a < sign
    - Flag: 1 = sample taken at buoy location; 2 = sample taken from shore when buoy sampling was not possible

- Metadata and data governance
  - Basic metadata included in the data file; notes indicate raw data status and sampling context.
  - Data are suitable for transparency and traceability but require quality control before full integration into official datasets.

- Funding and provenance
  - Data collection supported by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) award NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
