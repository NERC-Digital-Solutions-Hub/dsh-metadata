# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Blelham Tarn 2019 to 2020

## Summary
- Long-term monitoring dataset from fortnightly sampling at Blelham Tarn, Cumbria, England (Jan 2019–Dec 2020).
- Variables include surface temperature (TEMP, °C), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG, % air-saturation), Secchi depth (SECC, m), alkalinity (ALKA, µg CaCO3/L), pH, ammonium (NH4N, µg N/L), nitrate (NO3N, µg N/L), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P, µg P/L), total phosphorus (TOTP, µg P/L), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2, µg/L), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA, µg/L).
- Data are raw and uncalibrated but have been double entered and visually checked.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Water samples collected fortnightly by boat at a marked buoy location (deepest part of the lake) for integration from 0–5 m.
- When buoy access was not possible, samples were taken from the shore; surface temperature and oxygen still recorded, but shore samples were not integrated (Flag 2).

## Data content and units
- Measurements provided as values in specific units per variable (e.g., TEMP in °C, OXYG in % air-saturation, SECC in m, ALKA in µg CaCO3/L, pH unitless, NH4N/NO3N/PO4P/TOTP/SIO2/TOCA in µg/L or µg P/L as indicated).

## Data structure
- Data stored as CSV with:
  - Date: measurement date
  - Variable: name of the measurement
  - Value: measured value
  - Sign (if<LOD): indicator of detection limit (< sign if below LOD)
  - Flag: 1 = buoy-based lake sample; 2 = shore sample (not integrated)

## Quality control
- Data are raw and not yet quality controlled or calibrated.
- Quality checks performed: double entry and visual verification.

## Temporal coverage and frequency
- Timeframe: January 2019 to end of 2020.
- Sampling frequency: fortnightly.

## Data availability and limitations
- Missing data attributed to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.
- Data intended to be downloadable and usable for analysis and data products.

## Metadata and provenance
- Part of a long-term monitoring effort; data collection supported under Natural Environment Research Council (NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.

## Funding
- Natural Environment Research Council award NE/R016429/1 (UK-SCaPE programme).
