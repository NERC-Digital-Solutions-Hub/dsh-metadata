# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Blelham Tarn 2019 to 2020

## Overview
- Long-term fortnightly monitoring dataset from Blelham Tarn, Cumbria, England.
- Data collected from January 2019 to the end of 2020.
- Variables include surface temperature, surface oxygen saturation, Secchi depth, alkalinity, pH, nutrient concentrations (ammonium, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphate, total phosphorus, dissolved reactive silicon) and phytoplankton chlorophyll a.

## Data content and units
- Temperature (TEMP): °C
- Surface oxygen saturation (OXYG): % air-saturation
- Secchi depth (SECC): m
- Alkalinity (ALKA): µg CaCO3 per L
- pH: unitless
- Ammonium (NH4N): µg N per L
- Nitrate (NO3N): µg N per L
- Soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P): µg P per L
- Total phosphorus (TOTP): µg P per L
- Dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2): µg SiO2 per L
- Phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA): µg per L

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling of water from 0 to 5 m integrated depth.
- Measurements taken from a boat at a marked buoy at the deepest part of the lake; when visiting the buoy was not possible, samples were taken from the shore alongside surface temperature and oxygen measurements.
- Sampling period spans January 2019 to end of 2020.

## Data quality and limitations
- Data are raw, not yet quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
- Missing data due to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.
- Some shore samples are flagged (Flag 2) when buoy sampling was not possible.
- Values below detection limit indicated by a "<" sign in the Sign (if<LOD) column.

## Data structure and metadata
- Data provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns include: Date, Variable (and Description), Value (and Description), Sign (if<LOD), Flag.
- Flag meanings: Flag=1 indicates buoy-based sampling; Flag=2 indicates shore sampling.
- Documentation describes measurement method, sample location, and dataset scope.

## Study context and funding
- Funded by Natural Environment Research Council (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
- The dataset is part of an ongoing long-term monitoring effort intended to support analysis of lake physical, chemical, and biological conditions.
