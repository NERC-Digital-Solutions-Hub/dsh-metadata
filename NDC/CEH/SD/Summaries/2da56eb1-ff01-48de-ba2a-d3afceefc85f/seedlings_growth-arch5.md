# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

## Study area
- Conducted within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) area, KM41 reserve, ~100 km from Manaus, Brazil.
- Environment: humid/wet climate; mean temperature ~26.7°C; 2200 mm annual rainfall; dry season Jul–Sep; rain peak Mar–Apr.
- Vegetation: dense Terra Firme rainforest; canopy 30–37 m (emerging trees up to 55 m).
- Soils: clayey red-yellow podzols and yellow latosols; highly weathered, acidic, low fertility; ferrasols (WRB).

## AFEX experimental design
- Start: March 2017; full factorial design with seven treatments plus a control.
- Setup: 32 plots across four independent blocks (≥250 m apart); each plot 50 x 50 m.
- Treatments and combinations: Control; N (125 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as urea); P (50 kg P ha-1 yr-1 as triple superphosphate); CATIONS (50 kg K ha-1 yr-1 as KCl; 160 kg Ca ha-1; 160 kg Mg ha-1 as dolomitic limestone); N+P; N+CATIONS; P+CATIONS; N+P+CATIONS.
- Fertilization: annual, split into three applications to reduce leaching/runoff; applied by hand during a systematic walk within plots.

## Seedling sampling
- Sub-plot design: four 1 x 1 m sub-plots within a 30 x 30 m area inside each 50 x 50 m plot; 16 sub-plots per treatment (128 total).
- Sampling criteria: all individuals >20 cm height with diameter at ground height (DGH) < 1 cm identified and tagged; palms and lianas not identified.
- Measurements per seedling: height (ground to apex), DGH (mm), total leaves, leaves with herbivory damage, mortality (binary).
- Schedule: data collected bi-monthly over 12 months, totaling six replications per sub-plot (four in the rainy season, two in the dry season).
