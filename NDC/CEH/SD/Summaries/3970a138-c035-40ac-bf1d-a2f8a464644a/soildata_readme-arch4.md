# Data for soil samples taken from three locations at each transplant elevation

## Overview
- Soil samples were collected at Mt Etna across transplant elevations, with analyses conducted at Nucleo Chimico Mediterraneo laboratories, Catania, Italy.
- Each elevation includes three locations (sites) and replicates per site.

## Variables and Measurements
- Site: transplant elevation
- Sample: replicate sample at each elevation
- Texture/grain fractions: Grain>2mm (large-grained substrate), Grain<2mm (small-grained substrate)
- Particle sizes: Sand, Silt, Clay (proportions)
- Nutrients and soil chemistry:
  - Total N (g/kg)
  - C:N ratio
  - Organic matter (g/kg)
  - Available P (mg/kg)
  - Available K (mg/kg)
  - Total K (mg/kg)
- Soil reaction and conductivity:
  - pH
  - Conductivity (dS/m)
- Soluble ions (Columns 16-22): Chloride, Nitrate, Sulphites, Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium (all in milliequivalents per litre)
- Cation exchange capacity: (meq per 100 g)
- Exchangeable ions (Columns 24-27): Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium (meq per 100 g)
- K:Mg ratio

## Data Structure and Lab Details
- The dataset links each measurement to a specific site (elevation) and a replicate sample.
- Analyses performed by Nucleo Chimico Mediterraneo laboratories, Catania, Italy.
- Units used include g/kg, mg/kg, meq/L, meq per 100 g, and dS/m.

## Data Quality, Metadata, and Governance
- Important metadata to accompany the dataset:
  - Sampling dates and exact elevations/locations for each site
  - Methods for grain-size determination and other analyses
  - Detection limits and units for all measurements
  - Data dictionary mapping column names to variables (including Columns 16-22 and 24-27)
- Ensure data standardization across samples (consistent units and naming)
- Maintain versioning, data provenance, and clear documentation to support discoverability and reuse

## Implications and Uses for Data Leaders
- Enables cross-elevation soil fertility and texture comparisons at Mt Etna
- Supports modelling relationships between texture fractions and chemical properties
- Serves as a data asset for broader soil health assessments and ecological studies
- Can be integrated with other datasets for broader networked soil data analyses

## Next Steps and Recommendations
- Create and publish a detailed metadata record and data dictionary
- Document sampling protocol, lab methods, and quality checks
- Establish data governance practices: versioning, updates, and discoverability
- Consider sharing with partner networks or repositories to enhance broader data utility
