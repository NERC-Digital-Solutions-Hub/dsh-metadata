# Data for soil samples taken from three locations at each transplant elevation

- Overview: At each transplant elevation on Mt Etna, soil was extracted and analysed at Nucleo Chimico Mediterraneo laboratories, Catania, Italy.
- Sampling design
  - Site: Transplant elevation
  - Sample: Replicate sample at each elevation
  - Three locations per elevation
- Measured soil properties
  - Grain size and texture
    - Grain>2mm: Proportion of large-grained substrate
    - Grain<2mm: Proportion of small-grained substrate
    - Sand: Proportion of sand
    - Silt: Proportion of silt
    - Clay: Proportion of clay
