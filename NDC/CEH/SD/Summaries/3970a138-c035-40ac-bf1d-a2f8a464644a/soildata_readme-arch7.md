# Data for soil samples taken from three locations at each transplant elevation

## Overview
- Soil samples collected at Mt Etna across transplant elevations.
- Analysed at Nucleo Chimico Mediterraneo laboratories, Catania, Italy.

## Sampling design
- Data from three locations at each transplant elevation.
- Replicate sample at each elevation (Sample variable).

## Location and scope
- Site corresponds to transplant elevation on Mt Etna.
- Three locations per elevation; collectively cover different micro-site conditions.

## Variables and measurements
- Site: Transplant elevation
- Sample: Replicate sample at each elevation
- Grain>2mm: Proportion of large-grained substrate
- Grain<2mm: Proportion of small-grained substrate
- Sand: Proportion of sand
- Silt: Proportion of silt
- Clay: Proportion of clay
- Total N (g/kg): Total Nitrogen content
- C:N: Carbon to nitrogen ratio
- Organic matter (g/kg): Total organic matter present
- Available P (mg/kg): Available Phosphorus
- Available K (mg/kg): Available Potassium
- Total K (mg/kg): Total Potassium
- pH: Soil pH
- Conductivity (dS/m): Electrical conductivity
- Columns 16-22: Soluble ions in meq/L — chloride, nitrate, sulphites, sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium
- Cation exchange capacity (meq/100 g)
- Columns 24-27: Exchangeable ions (meq/100 g) — calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium
- K:Mg: Potassium to magnesium ratio

## Data format and use
- Measurements include columns for texture, chemical properties, nutrients, pH, conductivity, soluble and exchangeable ions.
- Units are specified to enable cross-site and elevation comparisons.
- Suitable for GIS-based visualizations of soil properties across elevations and locations.
