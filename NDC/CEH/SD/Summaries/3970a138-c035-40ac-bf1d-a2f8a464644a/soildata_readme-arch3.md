# Data for soil samples taken from three locations at each transplant elevation

## Overview
- Soil samples were collected at Mt Etna across multiple transplant elevations.
- Analyses were conducted at Nucleo Chimico Mediterraneo laboratories, Catania, Italy.

## Sampling design
- At each transplant elevation, soil was extracted from three locations.
- Replicate samples were collected at each elevation.
