# Data for soil samples taken from three locations at each transplant elevation

## Overview
- Soil samples were collected at Mt Etna from three locations at each transplant elevation.
- Samples were extracted and analysed at Nucleo Chimico Mediterraneo laboratories, Catania, Italy.

## Sampling design
- For each transplant elevation, soil was sampled with replicates (Sample: Replicate sample at each elevation).
- Data includes measurements across texture, chemistry, and ion composition.

## Variables and measurements
- Texture/substrate (proportions):
  - Grain>2mm
  - Grain<2mm
  - Sand
  - Silt
  - Clay
- Nutrients and general chemistry:
  - Total N (grams per kilogram)
  - C:N ratio
  - Organic matter (grams per kilogram)
  - Available P (milligrams per kilogram)
  - Available K (milligrams per kilogram)
  - Total K (milligrams per kilogram)
- pH and salinity:
  - pH
  - Conductibility (dS/m; deciSiemens per metre)
- Soluble ions (Columns 16-22): Chloride, nitrate, sulphites, sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium (milliequivalents per litre)
- Cation exchange capacity:
  - Cation exchange capacity (milliequivalents per 100 grams)
- Exchangeable ions (Columns 24-27): Calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium (milliequivalents per 100 grams)
- Potassium to magnesium balance:
  - K:Mg ratio

## Data structure notes
- Columns 16-22 contain Soluble ions (meq/L).
- Columns 24-27 contain Exchangeable ions (meq/100 g).
- Site-level variable: Site = transplant elevation.
- Sample-level variable: Sample = replicate at each elevation.

## Lab analysis
- All soil analyses conducted at Nucleo Chimico Mediterraneo laboratories, Catania, Italy.
