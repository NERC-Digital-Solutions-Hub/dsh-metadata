# Data for soil samples taken from three locations at each transplant elevation

## Overview
- Soil samples were collected at Mt Etna at three locations for each transplant elevation.
- Analyses were conducted at Nucleo Chimico Mediterraneo laboratories, Catania, Italy.

## Variables and measurements
- Site: Transplant elevation
- Sample: Replicate sample at each elevation
- Grain>2mm: Proportion of large-grained substrate
- Grain<2mm: Proportion of small-grained substrate
- Sand: Proportion of sand
- Silt: Proportion of silt
- Clay: Proportion of clay
- Total N (grams/kilogram): Total nitrogen content
- C:N: Carbon to nitrogen ratio
- Organic matter (grams/kilogram): Total organic matter present
- Available P (milligrams/kilogram): Available phosphorus
- Available K (milligrams/kilogram): Available potassium
- Total K (milligrams/kilogram): Total potassium
- pH
- Conductibility (dS/m; deciSiemens per metre): Electrical conductibility
- Columns 16-22: Soluble ions in milliequivalents per litre (chloride, nitrate, sulphites, sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium)
- Cation exchange capacity (milliequivalents per 100 grams)
- Columns 24-27: Exchangeable ions in milliequivalents per 100 grams (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium)
- K:Mg: Potassium to magnesium ratio

## Data provenance and context
- Location and sampling design: three locations per transplant elevation with replicates; provenance tied to Mt Etna sampling context.
- Analytical context: laboratory methods and units aligned to soil chemical analysis practices.
- Data ownership and source lab: Nucleo Chimico Mediterraneo laboratories, Catania, Italy.

## Metadata, documentation and standardization
- Dataset notes indicate unit types (g/kg, mg/kg, mg/L, dS/m) and column groupings (soluble vs. exchangeable ions).
- Clear mapping needed for columns 16-22 and 24-27 to ensure consistent interpretation across datasets.
- Recommendation: document sampling dates, exact locations (geocoordinates), elevation values, analytical methods, and QA steps as part of metadata.

## Data quality, standards and interoperability
- Ensure consistent units across all variables (e.g., grams/kilogram vs. kilograms; milligrams/kilogram; milliequivalents per litre; per 100 grams).
- Validate range checks for soil properties (pH, nutrients, ion concentrations) and logical relationships (e.g., texture components summing to 1 where applicable).
- Maintain traceability to the data source (lab and method) to support reproducibility and auditability.

## Sharing, access and governance considerations
- Data is intended for uploading to relevant portals and catalogues; readiness depends on complete metadata and clear variable definitions.
- Some data may require follow-up to obtain full details or clarifications (e.g., column mappings, method specifics).
- Consider embargo or access controls if data are sensitive or linked to unpublished studies.

## Recommendations for Data Stewards
- Develop a concise data dictionary detailing each variable, its unit, and acceptable value ranges.
- Create a standardized metadata record including sampling dates, elevations, locations, replicates, lab, and methods.
- Implement data quality checks and versioning to manage updates and corrections.
- Ensure interoperability by aligning units and naming with common soil data schemas and providing clear mappings for columns 16-27.
- Provide guidance on data sharing, including required permissions and appropriate portals for publication and discovery.
