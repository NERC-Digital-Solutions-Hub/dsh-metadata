# Data for soil samples taken from three locations at each transplant elevation

## Overview
- Soil data collected at each transplant elevation on Mt Etna.
- Three locations per elevation; soil extracted and analyzed at Nucleo Chimico Mediterraneo laboratories, Catania, Italy.

## Variables
- Site: Transplant elevation
- Sample: Replicate sample at each elevation
- Grain>2mm: Proportion of large-grained substrate
- Grain<2mm: Proportion of small-grained substrate
- Sand: Proportion of sand
- Silt: Proportion of silt
- Clay: Proportion of clay
- Total N (g/kg): Total nitrogen content
- C:N: Carbon to nitrogen ratio
- Organic matter (g/kg): Total organic matter present
- Available P (mg/kg): Available phosphorus
- Available K (mg/kg): Available potassium
- Total K (mg/kg): Total potassium
- pH: Acidity/alkalinity
- Conductivity (dS/m): Electrical conductibility
- Columns 16-22: Soluble ions in meq/L (chloride, nitrate, sulphites, sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium)
- Cation exchange capacity (meq/100 g): CEC
- Columns 24-27: Exchangeable ions (meq/100 g) (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium)
- K:Mg: Potassium to magnesium ratio

## Data characteristics and use
- Multidimensional soil profile data combining texture, nutrient content, pH, EC, and both soluble and exchangeable ion data.
- Enables analyses of how soil properties vary with transplant elevation and among replicate locations.
- Suitable for developing predictive models relating soil texture and chemistry to fertility or plant performance, with considerations for data scale, units, and potential replication effects.
