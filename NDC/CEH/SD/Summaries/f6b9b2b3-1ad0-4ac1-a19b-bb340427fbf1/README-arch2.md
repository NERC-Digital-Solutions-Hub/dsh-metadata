# Description of the Data and file structure

- Focus: Abundance of freshwater macroinvertebrates recorded by the Environment Agency, stored as a long-form dataset (year, month, day, site, sample, taxon, abundance) in an R-friendly rds file.
- Timeframe: 2002–2019 (data before 2002 excluded due to lack of widespread abundance recording).
- Geography: Sites across England; across ten river basins defined under the EU Water Framework Directive; bias toward mid to lower perennial reaches.
- Sampling method: Three-minute kick-samples (net disturbance for 3 minutes downstream of a sampled area).
- Data lineage: Processed from the EA Ecology and Fish Explorer Macroinvertebrate database; data are pooled by family and wider taxonomic groupings.
- File format and access: Single rds file; accessible via R; missing values coded as NA.
- Data lineage note: Used in a 2022 Global Change Biology manuscript exploring abundance trends across taxa, trophic groups, and river typology.

- Data processing details
  - Abundance counts are discrete and represent the number of individuals observed
  - Abundance aggregated at the family level within included taxa (e.g., Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, etc.)
  - Data manipulated and analyzed in R between 2019–2022
- Quality control
  - Since 2002, improved QA with one in ten samples independently re-analysed
  - Original data extended back to 1991, but restricted to 2002–2019 for reliability
- Accessibility and reuse

  - Used in Powell et al. (2022) Global Change Biology publication
- Units and interpretation
  - Recorded values are discrete abundance counts (number of individuals per sample)
