# Collection/generation methods

- Overview
  - Describes the generation of the land elevation data (DEM) for the tidally influenced Conwy estuary, including offshore areas, with integration of seabed bathymetry, land elevations, and flood defence information.
  - The model domain combines marine DEMs, lidar-derived terrain and surface models, and OS Terrain data, then creates a continuous surface for hydrodynamic modelling.

- Data sources and fusion
  - Seabed bathymetry for Menai Strait, Conwy Bay, and estuary mouth from OceanWise via Digimap; 1 arc-second raster tiles; WGS84 with Chart Datum (CD) reference for bathymetry.
  - Land elevations: NRW lidar-based DTM/DSM (1 m resolution) via Digimap; OSGB36 projection; elevations referenced to OD with ±0.15 m RMSE. Remaining land areas from OS Terrain 5 m DTM (5 m resolution) for national coverage; OSGB36 projection; elevations referenced to OD.
  - Flood defences: NRW vector shapefiles (location, type, crest height) projected to British National Grid.
  - All data imported into ArcGIS Pro 3.0 and mosaicked into a single raster at 5 m resolution; marine DEM, lidar DTM, and OS Terrain 5 m DTM used to build the domain topography.

- Spatial alignment and datum handling
  - Marine DEM projected to OSGB36 and converted from Chart Datum to Ordnance Datum (OD) by subtracting 3.85 m.
  - Masking rules when sources overlap: underwater areas prioritized with marine DEM; Lidar DTM used to fill gaps; land areas prioritized with Lidar DTM and OS Terrain 5 m DTM used for gaps.
  - A continuous surface is generated by mosaicking rasters, converting to a point grid (one point per raster cell), and interpolating to a 20 m resolution surface (topo-to-raster method).

- Flood defences integration
  - Flood defence polylines checked against Lidar DSM; missing defences digitised and crest heights estimated from DSM elevations.
  - Augmented vectors buffered by 20 m to create polygons, converted to 20 m rasters, and added to the surface to produce the final model domain including defences.

- Riverbed representation and limitations
  - The model domain represents floodplain elevations, defences, and marine elevations but lacks accurate riverbed elevations in areas not covered by marine DEM.
  - Riverbed elevations estimated from Lidar DTM; LiDAR limitations for inundated topography (light refraction across air-water boundary and water column turbidity) can lead to shallower channels; calibration focuses on correcting this.

- Data standards and structure
  - Final DEM elevations are in metres, vertically referenced to Ordnance Datum (Newlyn), spatially referenced to British National Grid.
  - Data format: Digital Elevation Model ASCII.

- Calibration and hydrodynamic modelling
  - DEM used in the Caesar-Lisflood hydrodynamic model (reach mode) with upstream discharge and downstream sea level time series as forcing.
  - Upstream boundary: NRW discharge time series (15-minute resolution) for 1 March–16 April 2021.
  - Offshore boundary: sea level time series at Llandudno from BODC (15-minute intervals), converted from CD to OD (-3.85 m offset).
  - Hydraulic parameters: Manning’s n = 0.022; Courant number = 0.6; Froude limit = 0.8; water loss function of 0.2 m/day applied to floodplains only to prevent water accumulation behind defences.
  - Model outputs: hydrodynamic water levels at 15-minute intervals.

- Calibration workflow and validation
  - Calibrated against gauges Pont Fawr, Trefriw, and Tal-y-Cafn (OD-referenced, 15-minute intervals): Pont Fawr and Trefriw NRW gauges; Tal-y-Cafn with a local pressure logger (from Oct 2020).
  - Initial DEM adjustment used channel bathymetry as a calibration parameter (Neal et al., 2022).
  - Final calibration results (RMSE and Kling-Gupta Efficiency, KGE):
    - RMSE: Pont Fawr 0.59 m, Trefriw 0.39 m, Tal-y-Cafn 0.69 m.
    - KGE: Pont Fawr 0.90, Trefriw 0.90, Tal-y-Cafn 0.70.
    - Flood peaks RMSE: Pont Fawr 0.57 m, Trefriw 0.19 m, Tal-y-Cafn 0.29 m.
  - Notes: Upper estuary performance may be affected by missing tributaries; the calibration focused on matching observed water levels and peak magnitudes.
