# WildCrickets06E_EmergenceVsSurvival

## Overview
- Dataset describing individual male crickets categorized by early (E) or late (L) adult emergence relative to the median emergence date.
- Key fields: Year, Year when the cricket was alive, Lifespan (days), Emergence (E or L).

## Data Content and Structure
- Observations likely represent individual crickets.
- Variables:
  - Year: year when the cricket was alive.
  - Year when the cricket was alive (clarifies the temporal context).
  - Lifespan: duration of life in days.
  - Emergence: early (E) or late (L) emergence relative to the median date.

## Potential Analyses for a Data Support approach
- Compare Lifespan distributions between Early (E) and Late (L) emergence groups.
- Compute summary statistics by Emergence (mean, median, variance) and by Year.
- Visualize survival patterns and lifespan trends across years.
- Create self-serve dashboards or pivot-table reports for end users to explore Emergence vs. Lifespan.

## Data Quality and Preparation Considerations
- Clarify definitions (e.g., exact meaning of “Year” and “Year when the cricket was alive”).
- Check for missing values in Lifespan and Emergence fields.
- Ensure consistent data types and units (lifespan in days).
- Be mindful of potential small sample sizes and how they affect comparisons.

## How this aligns with Data Support aims
- Facilitates discovery and exploration through data products (dashboards/charts) enabling self-service analysis.
- Involves data cleaning, transformation, and basic comparative analysis to support broader topics.
