# WildCrickets06D_LatencyToMateSenescence Description of content

## Overview
- A dataset describing the latency to mate for male crickets after a pair meets, with a binary classification: short (≤ 50 minutes) or not (> 50 minutes).
- Includes temporal and biological context: Year, Year alive (life-history year), ID (individual), Age (days), FeAge (female age at mating in days), Temp (ambient temperature in °C), Short (1 if short latency, 0 if not).

## Variables and definitions
- Duration: time from pair meeting to mating, categorized as short or not.
- Year: year associated with the observation (contextual time point).
- Year alive: the year the cricket was alive (life-history context).
- ID: unique identifier for each individual cricket.
- Age: male age in days at mating.
- FeAge: female age at mating in days.
- Temp: ambient environmental temperature in degrees Celsius.
- Short: binary indicator (1 = short latency, 0 = not short latency).

## Data use and purpose
- Enables analysis of environmental and biological factors affecting mating latency and senescence in crickets.
- Supports comparisons over time and across individuals, contributing to environmental monitoring and understanding of life-history responses.

## Data handling and quality expectations
- Data should be understood from established sources, then verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed as needed.
- Analyses should employ standardized methods to produce outputs such as categorisations aligned with environmental health or standard benchmarks.
- Findings are presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts), with datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for accessibility.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring and policy performance
- Provides time- and temperature-contextualized biological indicators related to reproductive timing and senescence.
- Facilitates cross-dataset integration by using standardized variables (Date/Year, Age, Temp, categorical Short) to assess environmental health over time.

## Key challenges and opportunities
- Increasing the value of the dataset by integrating with other relevant data (e.g., additional life-history metrics, broader environmental variables) rather than treating it as a standalone study.
- Ensuring accessible underlying data so that others can reproduce or build upon the analyses and outputs.
