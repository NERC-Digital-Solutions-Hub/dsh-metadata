# WildCrickets06D_LatencyToMateSenescence Description of content

- Describes a dataset measuring the latency of male crickets to mate after pair formation, classified as short (≤ 50 minutes) or not (> 50 minutes).
- Data fields included:
  - Duration: Time before mating, categorized as short or not.
  - Short: Binary indicator (1 if short, 0 if not).
  - Year: Year when the cricket was alive.
  - ID: Individual identification.
  - Age: Age in days.
  - FeAge: Female age at mating in days.
  - Temp: Ambient temperature in degrees Celsius.
- Purpose: To capture biological timing (mating latency) in relation to age and temperature, enabling analysis of senescence effects on mating latency.
