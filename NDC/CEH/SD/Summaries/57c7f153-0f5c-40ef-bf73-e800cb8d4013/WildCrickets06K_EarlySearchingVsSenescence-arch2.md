# WildCrickets06K_EarlySearchingVsSenescence Description of content

## Overview
- Dataset describing singing activity for each sample and male cricket.
- Includes a classification of early-life searching effort as High (H) or Low (L) and aims to relate this to senescence.

## Data fields and encoding
- EarlySearching: Classification of early-life searching effort as High (H) or Low (L) — above or below the population median.
- Year: Year when the cricket was alive.
- ID: Individual identification.
- Temp: Ambient temperature at the time of sampling (in °C).
- Age: Age of the individual at sampling (in days).
- Sings: Whether the cricket sang at sampling (1 = yes, 0 = no).

## Variables and measurement details
- Sings is a binary indicator (1/0) of singing at the time of sampling.
- Temp is measured in degrees Celsius and reflects the environmental condition during sampling.
- Age is recorded in days, providing a time-from-origin perspective for analyses.
- EarlySearching indicates early-life behavioral category (H or L) linked to potential differences in later performance or senescence.
- Year anchors temporal context for comparisons across time.

## Potential uses for environmental monitoring
- Examine associations between early-life behavioral investment (H/L) and later singing behavior (senescence indicators).
- Analyze how ambient temperature and age influence singing activity.
- Compare patterns across years to monitor environmental or population-level trends in crickets.

## Data quality and management considerations
- Follow standardized data handling: verify, quality assure, clean, and transform data as needed.
- Store and upload datasets to appropriate portals to ensure accessibility and reuse.
- Use consistent coding for EarlySearching (H/L) and for Sings (1/0) to enable cross-study comparisons.

## Challenges and opportunities
- Increase value by integrating this dataset with additional environmental or ecological data.
- Facilitate access to underlying data to support broader scrutiny and policy-relevant analyses.
