# WildCrickets06L_EarlyDominanceVsSenescence Description of content

- Dataset focuses on singing activity per sample and per individual male, including whether the individual was high dominance (above population median) or low dominance (below population median) early in life (EarlyDominance). EarlyDominance is classified as High (H) or Low (L).
- Key variables:
  - Year: Year when the cricket was alive.
  - ID: Individual identification.
  - Temp: Ambient temperature when sampled (in °C).
  - Age: Age when sampled (in days).
  - Sings: Singing presence at sampling (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- Purpose implication:
  - Enables analysis of how early-life dominance status relates to later behaviors (singing) and potential senescence indicators, in the context of environmental conditions (temperature) and age.
- Data scope and structure:
  - Sample- and individual-level observations capturing behavioral data (Sings) and a life-history trait (EarlyDominance), alongside environmental context (Temp) and demographic data (Age, Year, ID).
- Relevance for environmental monitoring:
  - Supports time-series studies assessing how environmental factors and life-history traits influence behavioral expressions across years.
  - Provides a standardized set of fields suitable for integration into broader environmental health dashboards and policy-performance monitoring.
