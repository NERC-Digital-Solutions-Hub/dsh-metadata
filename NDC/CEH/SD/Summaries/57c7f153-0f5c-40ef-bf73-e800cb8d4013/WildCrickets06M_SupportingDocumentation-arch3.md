# Trade-off between reproduction and body maintenance in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population

## Overview
- Long-term field study (twelve consecutive years) examining how reproduction interacts with body maintenance in Gryllus campestris.
- Aims to capture life-history trade-offs via detailed behavioral and physiological metrics, supported by continuous monitoring and rich metadata.

## Study site and population
- WildCrickets field site located in Asturias, North Spain (meadow near a river valley; ~60–270 m altitude; 20,000 m2 meadow; ~800 m2 core cricket habitat).
- Population persists in a meadow with surrounding shrubs/trees, railway line nearby; limited migration due to shade and roads.
- Population dynamics characterized by annual seasonal timing: adult emergence in spring, mating through early summer, diapause in late season; monitoring from first adult emergence through end of activity.

## Monitoring design and sampling regime
- Regular mowing schedule: mid-March and July–August with additional mowing to maintain short grass between August and March.
- Burrow-focused monitoring: weekly searches from February to July to locate active burrows.
- Camera network: infrared day/night cameras installed prior to adult emergence; number evolved from 64 in 2006 to 140 by 2017; cameras moved among burrows to maximize data per individual.
- Continuous recording: video captured 24/7 from first adult emergence until two consecutive days with no cricket activity.
- Weather data: centralized weather station logs every 10 minutes plus multiple sensors placed around the meadow (surface and burrow environments).

## Collection methods and sampling
- Individual handling: upon emergence, each cricket is trapped, weighed (±0.01 g), photographed, and tagged with a unique PVC marker on the pronotum; tag enables video-based identification.
- Physiological sampling: cuticular hydrocarbons, haemolymph, and a small leg tip collected for chemical and DNA profiling.
- Data linkage: each individual’s tag codes linked to video and sample data for longitudinal tracking.

## Field instrumentation and data capture
- Video infrastructure: DVR system feeding multiple computers; recordings activated by motion detection; typical setup evolves from 64 to 140 cameras.
- Direct observations: non-video burrows are checked every 1–2 days to confirm occupancy and emergence timing.
- Burrow and activity recording: events logged post-video review (emergence, encounters, singing, mating, fights, oviposition, predation, movement).
- Additional observations: burow use by other animals (slugs, isopods, beetles, earwigs, spiders, bees) documented.

## Calibration, quality control and data processing
- Instrument calibration: all devices factory-calibrated.
- Data processing workflow: two-step per-day video analysis.
  - Step 1: rapidly classify burrows as in-use vs empty across all cameras.
  - Step 2: detailed analysis of selected cameras to record events; manual stamping into a spreadsheet before import.
- Data integrity: comprehensive quality-control queries in MS Access detect inconsistencies (e.g., same cricket recorded in two burrows simultaneously); data are only used after passing QC.

## Methodology and variables (data collection specifics)
- Emergence date: high synchronization; ~95% of males emerge within a two-week window; mean emergence period ~14 days (± 3.66 SD).
- Calling activity: male singing behavior quantified as a daily binary indicator for each hour (based on 10 minutes of sampling per hour; at least five days of data per male; age threshold of five days).
- Searching activity: intensity inferred from burrow-visit duration; continuous durations are right-skewed and converted to a binary short (≤77 minutes) vs long (>77 minutes) category; only solitary male visits are analyzed to avoid confounding by conspecifics.
- Dominance in fights: fight outcomes assigned to both participants (1 for win, 0 for loss); scoring paired with male age to build dominance measures across encounters.
- Mating promptness: latency between initial encounter and mating is highly skewed; converted to binary with ≤50 minutes as "prompt" (1) and >50 minutes as "delayed" (0); thresholds chosen based on observed data and related species benchmarks.

## Data scope and longitudinal framework
- Spanning over a dozen years with consistent methodology evolution (e.g., camera count, data handling) maintained for comparability.
- Integrated data streams include behavioral observations, environmental context (weather), individual physiological samples, and genetic/pheromone profiling to explore trade-offs between reproductive timing and somatic maintenance.
