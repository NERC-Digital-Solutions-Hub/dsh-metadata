# WildCrickets06I_EarlyLatencyVsSurvival Description of content

- Purpose: Describe an dataset where individual male lifespan is classified by early-life time to mate, grouped into High effort (H) or Low effort (L) based on whether this metric is above or below the population median.

- Key variables:
  - Year: Year when the cricket was alive.
  - Lifespan: Lifespan in days.
  - EarlyLatency: Categorical indicator of early-life mating effort — High (H) or Low (L).

- Derived classification rule:
  - EarlyLatency is High if time to mate in early life is above the population median; Low if it is below the median.

- Data use implications:
  - Enables analysis of survival in relation to early-life mating effort, with year-to-year context.

- Data quality and governance considerations (implied by the content):
  - Not explicitly detailed in the description; typical considerations include data provenance, consistent measurement of time to mate, clear documentation of how the population median is calculated, units of lifespan (days), and handling of any missing data.
