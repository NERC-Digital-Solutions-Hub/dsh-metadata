# Trade-off between reproduction and body maintenance in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population

## Overview
- Supporting documentation for a long-term field study on Gryllus campestris in Asturias, Spain.
- Focus on how data on reproduction and body maintenance are collected, stored, processed, and quality-checked to enable analysis of trade-offs.

## Field site and population
- WildCrickets field site: Asturias, North Spain, near a river valley; meadow of about 20,000 m2, with surrounding habitat including meadows, orchards, and eucalyptus.
- Population occupies an ~800 m2 flat area on the meadow; crickets are flightless and univoltine, with adults emerging in spring and dying by early summer.
- Population monitored for twelve consecutive years; meadow management includes seasonal mowing and restricted movement across the site.

## Data collection regime
- Sampling window: adult crickets trapped a few days after emergence, weighed, photographed, and tagged with a unique PVC pronotum tag; samples collected per individual (cuticular hydrocarbons, haemolymph, leg tip).
- Individual identification: tag codes enable identification on video.
- Behavioral and ecological data collected via continuous video monitoring and direct field observations.
- Infrared cameras: 64 initially (2006), expanding to 140 by 2017; cameras installed around burrow entrances to record activity 24/7 during the breeding season.
- Weather data: central meadow weather station logging every 10 minutes, with additional sensors placed in simulated burrows.
- Burrow-focused data: each burrow receives a unique flag; direct observations supplement video data for burrows without cameras.

## Instrumentation and data streams
- Video: Digital Video Recording system with motion-triggered recording; data stored on multiple computers; videos reviewed in two passes to identify burrows in use and extract events.
- Calibration: all instruments factory-calibrated.
- Biological samples: hydrocarbons, haemolymph, and leg tissue collected for individual pheromone and DNA analyses.

## Data processing and quality control
- Data extraction: two-step per-day video review; initial pass screens for burrow use, followed by detailed viewing of multiple cameras; events logged into MS Excel and imported into MS Access database.
- Quality control: series of Access queries to detect inconsistencies (e.g., same cricket recorded in two burrows simultaneously); data are not used until consistency checks pass.
- Data management tools: data organized in MS Access with Excel-based processing; video metadata linked to individual IDs via tag codes.

## Derived measures and variables
- Emergence date: highly synchronized; ~95% of males emerge within a two-week window; mean emergence period around 14 days (± ~3.66 SD).
- Calling activity: quantified as a binary indicator per hour (whether a male sang during any of ten 1-minute samples in that hour).
- Searching activity: burrow-visit duration transformed to a binary variable (short ≤ 77 minutes = 1; long > 77 minutes = 0), focusing on solitary visits to ensure independence from others.
- Dominance in fights: fights recorded with win/loss scores for both participants; dominance inferred from burrow occupancy and mating opportunities.
- Mating promptness: latency from initial encounter to mating converted to a binary variable (≤ 50 minutes = 1; > 50 minutes = 0) to reflect a rapid mating window related to spermatophore formation time.

## Data management and scope
- Data collection spans multiple interconnected datasets: emergence, calling, searching, combat, mating latencies, video events, and associated biological samples.
- Data are tied to individual crickets (via tags) and burrow locations, enabling longitudinal analyses of life-history trade-offs.
- Data storage/logistics: extensive video data stored on DVR systems; analytical data stored in MS Access/Excel; field instruments calibrated and maintained regularly.

## Timeline and scale
- Camera deployment expanded over time: from 64 cameras (2006) to 140 cameras (2017).
- Continuous, year-to-year data collection aligned with the cricket breeding season and burrow activity cycles.
- Weather and microhabitat data collected to contextualize behavioral and life-history measurements.
