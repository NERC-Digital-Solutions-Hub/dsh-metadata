# WildCrickets06I_EarlyLatencyVsSurvival Description of content

- What the dataset captures: Individual male cricket lifespan and early-life mating effort classification.
- Key variables:
  - Year: Year when the cricket was alive.
  - Lifespan: Lifespan in days.
  - EarlyLatency: High (H) or Low (L) effort in time to mate during early life.
- How EarlyLatency is defined: Classified as High if time to mate in early life is above the population median; Low if it is below the population median.
- Purpose for environment/monitoring use: Enables analysis of survival patterns and reproductive timing over time, contributing to assessments of population health and potential environmental influences.
- Data quality and processing considerations:
  - Data should be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed from established sources.
  - Clear, consistent calculation of the population median and consistent coding of EarlyLatency.
  - Lifespan is measured in days; ensure consistent units across records.
- Outputs and formats: Results can be displayed as tables, maps, and charts, facilitating cross-year comparisons and trend identification.
- Data management and access:
  - Created datasets should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals to ensure accessibility.
- Challenges for the archetype:
  - Increasing the value of the dataset by integrating with other relevant data.
  - Enabling access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs.
