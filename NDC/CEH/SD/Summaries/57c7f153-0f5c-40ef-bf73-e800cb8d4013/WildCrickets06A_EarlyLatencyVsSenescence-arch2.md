# WildCrickets06A_EarlyLatencyVsSenescence Description of content

## Overview
- A dataset describing singing activity per cricket sample and per individual male.
- Includes a classification of mating latency relative to the population median (EarlyLatency) and a corresponding Latency category (High H or Low L).
- Observations include Year, ID (individual identifier), Temp (ambient temperature in °C), Age (days), and Sings (1 if singing, 0 otherwise).

## Key Variables and Coding
- EarlyLatency: description of mating latency relative to the population median.
- Latency: categorical value (High H or Low L) indicating longer or shorter time to mate.
- Year: year when the cricket was alive.
- ID: individual identification.
- Temp: ambient temperature at sampling (°C).
- Age: age of the cricket at sampling (days).
- Sings: whether the cricket was singing at sampling (1 = yes, 0 = no).

## Dataset Structure
- Observations are linked to individual males and sampling events.
- Combines behavioral data (singing) with mating latency and basic biophysical context (temperature, age).

## Potential Uses for Environmental Monitoring
- Assess how environmental temperature relates to singing activity and mating latency.
- Explore aging/senescence patterns in relation to mating timing and behavior.
- Track temporal trends across years to infer environmental health impacts on crickets.

## Data Quality and Access Considerations
- Data should be verified, quality-assured, cleaned, and transformed using standardised methods.
- Outputs should be clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals.
- Consider interoperability: ensure consistent units (°C for Temp), consistent IDs (ID), and clear documentation of coding for EarlyLatency and Latency. 
- Aim to enable broad access to underlying data to support transparency and secondary analyses.
