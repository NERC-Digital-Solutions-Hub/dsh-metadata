# WildCrickets06H_EarlyDominanceVsSurvival Description of content

- This dataset describes individual male crickets with a focus on early-life social dominance and subsequent survival.
- Each record links lifespan with a classification of early-life dominance as high (H) or low (L) relative to the population median.
- Key intended use: to explore potential relationships between early dominance and longevity, informing hypotheses and monitoring across cohorts or time.

## Data fields

- Year: Year when the cricket was alive.
- Lifespan: Lifespan in days.
- EarlyDominance: High (H) or low (L) dominance on early life, defined by whether early-life dominance exceeds or falls below the population median.

## Data quality and governance considerations

- Metadata clarity: Clear definition of how the population median is computed to ensure reproducibility.
- Data standardization: Consistent units (days for Lifespan); consistent coding for EarlyDominance.
- Accessibility and sharing: Consider open data sharing while respecting any restrictions; provide provenance and originators of datasets.
- Data completeness: Assess and document any missing values for Year, Lifespan, or EarlyDominance.
- Transformation needs: Some analyses may require verification or harmonization of dominance classifications across cohorts.

## Potential monitoring and policy relevance

- Use to assess whether early-life social factors influence survival, contributing to environmental health measures and animal behavior studies.
- Enable comparisons across years or cohorts to detect trends in longevity related to early dominance.
- Inform reporting dashboards or dashboards that combine biological metrics with behavioral indicators.

## Practical considerations and limitations

- Approach relies on median-based classification; sensitivity analyses may be needed if median varies by subgroup.
- Data may be sparse or uneven across years, affecting statistical power.
- Interpretations should consider ecological and behavioral context beyond the recorded metrics.
