# WildCrickets06H_EarlyDominanceVsSurvival Description of content

- The dataset describes individual male crickets with lifespan and early-life dominance classification.
- Purpose: to study the relationship between early-life dominance in fights and survival (lifespan) in days.
- Key fields:
  - Year: calendar year in which the cricket was alive.
  - Year alive: the year associated with the cricket’s life event(s).
  - Lifespan: total lifespan in days.
  - EarlyDominance: a binary category indicating early-life dominance, with values High (H) or Low (L).
- Dominance classification rationale:
  - EarlyDominance is determined as a relative measure ( High if dominance is above the population median; Low if below), representing an early-life behavioral trait linked to survival.
- Data types:
  - Year and Lifespan: numeric/integer.
  - EarlyDominance: categorical (H or L).
- Data quality considerations:
  - Clarity needed for the exact meaning of Year vs Year alive (how each is defined in the study timeline).
  - Potential missing values in any field (Year, Lifespan, EarlyDominance).
  - Consistency of how dominance was measured and how the population median was computed to define High vs Low.
  - Possible measurement error in lifespan or in determining dominance from fights.
- Data governance and usage notes:
  - Metadata should document data provenance, collection methods, and any preprocessing (e.g., how dominance was assessed, how lifespans were recorded).
  - Ensure clear definitions, units, and constraints for users intending to combine this dataset with others.
  - Consider caveats when linking Year fields to broader temporal analyses or longitudinal studies.
- Potential analyses:
  - Association between EarlyDominance and Lifespan.
  - Stratified analyses by Year or other experimental conditions.
  - Evaluation of data completeness and potential biases related to data collection timing or observation effort.
