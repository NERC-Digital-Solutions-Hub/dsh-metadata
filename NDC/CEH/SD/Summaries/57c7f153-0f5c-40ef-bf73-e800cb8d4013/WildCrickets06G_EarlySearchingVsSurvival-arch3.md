# WildCrickets06G_EarlySearchingVsSurvival

## Overview
- Describes an individual male cricket dataset linking early-life searching effort to lifespan.
- Classifies survival outcomes based on early behavioral effort.

## Data fields
- Year: year when the cricket was alive.
- Lifespan: lifespan in days.
- EarlySearching: High (H) or Low (L) effort on early searching.

## Classification rules
- EarlySearching is High (H) if the effort is above the population median.
- EarlySearching is Low (L) if the effort is below the population median.

## Use in monitoring frameworks
- Provides measurable indicators (lifespan) tied to early-life behavior (searching effort) for environmental health monitoring.
- Useful for trend analysis across years and for informing habitat quality or resource distribution assessments.
- Can be visualized in charts or dashboards to support policy or management decisions.

## Data governance and quality considerations
- Metadata needs: clear method for determining population median, data origin, sampling approach, and observation context.
- Data sharing and openness: consider openness barriers when publishing datasets.
- Standardization and metadata completeness: ensure consistent definitions of EarlySearching and consistent data collection procedures.
- Data quality: verify accurate lifespan measurements and handle missing data appropriately.

## Limitations and challenges
- Potential for small sample sizes and observational biases.
- Definitional clarity required for how early searching is measured and median is calculated.
- Generalizability to other species or systems may be limited without additional validation.
