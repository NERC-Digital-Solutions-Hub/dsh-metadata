# WildCrickets06F_EarlyCallingVsSurvival Description of content

## Overview
- Describes individual male crickets’ lifespan classified by early calling effort.
- EarlyCalling is defined as High (H) if calling more than the population median; Low (L) if calling less than the median.

## Key variables
- Year: Year when the cricket was alive.
- Lifespan: Lifespan in days.
- EarlyCalling: High (H) or Low (L) effort on early calling.

## Purpose for monitoring frameworks
- Enables examination of the relationship between early behavioral effort (calling) and lifespan, contributing to understanding environmental health and life-history responses.

## Data considerations for monitoring
- Clear metadata needed: definitions for Year, Lifespan (units, measurement method), and the criterion for High/Low (population median).
- Consideration of data quality and consistency to support reliable monitoring and comparability across studies.

## Implementation notes
- Simple, interpretable indicator linking behavior to survival that can be integrated into dashboards or reports alongside other environmental health metrics.

## Limitations and caveats
- Based on a single species with a basic High/Low dichotomy; may require broader context or more nuanced measures for comprehensive monitoring.
