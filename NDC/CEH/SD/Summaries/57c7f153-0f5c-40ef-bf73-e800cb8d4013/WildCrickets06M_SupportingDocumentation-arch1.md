# SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION:
Trade-off between reproduction and body maintenance in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population

## Study Site and Population Overview
- WildCrickets field site located in Asturias, North Spain; meadow ~20,000 m2 with 800 m2 occupied by Gryllus campestris; nearby railway line; altitude 60–270 m.
- Population monitored for twelve consecutive years; meadow mowing in March and July–August; gradual changes in surrounding land.
- Crickets prefer sunny meadows; focal population occupies a ~800 m2 flat area on the meadow floor; limited migration due to shade and roads.

## Sampling and Data Collection Methods
- Individual handling: trap each cricket soon after adult emergence, weigh (±0.01 g), photograph, and tag with a unique PVC pronotum tag (codes 1–2 characters); samples collected for pheromone/DNA profiling (cuticular hydrocarbons, haemolymph, hind-leg tissue).
- Field instrumentation: infrared day/night cameras installed around burrows (64 initially; up to 133–140 over time; 2017 deployment). Cameras record 24/7 during the breeding season; number of cameras adjusted to maximize data.
- Weather data: central meadow weather station (Davis Vantage Pro2) with additional surface sensors (10-minute intervals).

## Field Work and Instrumentation
- Burrow mapping: each burrow flagged with a unique ID; direct observations conducted for non-videoed burrows to determine occupancy and emergence timing.
- Video management: DVR system stores footage; motion-activated recording; post hoc review to extract events and behaviors.
- Temporal coverage: videos collected from onset of adult eclosion until no activity for two days; cameras moved between burrows to optimize coverage.

## Data Handling, Quality Control, and Calibration
- Calibration: all instruments factory calibrated.
- Data processing: two-step video analysis per day; initial pass to separate burrows in use from empty ones; deeper review of selected cameras; data imported into MS Access database for processing.
- Quality control: series of Access queries to detect inconsistencies (e.g., cricket recorded at two burrows simultaneously); data only used after consistency checks.

## Variables and Measures
- Emergence date: 95% of adult males emerge within a two-week window; mean emergence period ~14 days (SD ±3.66).
- Calling activity: quantifying singing by hourly 10-minute samples; a binary indicator per hour if the male sang at least once within the 10-minute window; inclusion requires ≥5 samples per day and ≥24 total samples per male.
- Searching activity: burrow visit duration used as a proxy; highly right-skewed; transformed into binary short (≤77 min) versus long (>77 min) stays; analysis restricted to visits where focal male was alone.
- Dominance in fights: fights at burrows tracked; winners/losers scored as 1/0 for each participant; multiple fights per male; scores recorded against the male’s age.
- Mating promptness: latency from first encounter to mating transformed into binary ≤50 minutes (1) versus >50 minutes (0); threshold chosen because most matings occur within that timespan and aligns with spermatophore production dynamics.

## Study Management and Temporal Coverage
- Longitudinal design spanning multiple years; camera networks expanded from 64 (2006) to 140 (by 2017); continuous monitoring during adult activity period each breeding season.
- Field and lab instruments are integrated to support comprehensive behavioral and physiological profiling (behavioral metrics, pheromone/DNA profiling).

## Additional Context and Purpose
- Study focuses on trade-offs between reproduction and body maintenance by linking synchronized emergence, mating behaviors, and aggressive interactions with environmental monitoring data.
- Rich, multi-source dataset (video, direct observations, physiological samples, weather data) designed to enable correlations, models, and predictive insights about reproductive strategies and maintenance costs.
