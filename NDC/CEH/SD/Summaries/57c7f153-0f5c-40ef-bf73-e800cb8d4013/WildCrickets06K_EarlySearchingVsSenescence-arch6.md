- Focus: A dataset on wild crickets examining early-life searching behavior and senescence, recording singing activity per sample and per male.
- Key concept: EarlySearching is classified as high (H) or low (L) based on the individual’s effort in searching early in life.
- Primary variables:
  - EarlySearching: H or L (high or low early-life searching effort)
  - Year: year when the cricket was alive
  - ID: individual identifier
  - Temp: ambient temperature at sampling (°C)
  - Age: age at sampling (days)
  - Sings: 1 if singing, 0 if not singing at the time of sampling
- Data structure: Records are described per sample and per individual male, allowing analysis of how early-life searching effort relates to singing behavior across ages and conditions.
