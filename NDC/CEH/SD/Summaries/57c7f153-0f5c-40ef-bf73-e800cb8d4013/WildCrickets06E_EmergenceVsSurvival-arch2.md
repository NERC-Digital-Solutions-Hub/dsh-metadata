# WildCrickets06E_EmergenceVsSurvival

- Purpose: A dataset describing individual male crickets, classified by lifespan relative to emergence timing to support environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessments over time.

- Scope: Each record represents one male cricket with three key attributes:
  - Year: the calendar year in which the cricket was alive.
  - Lifespan: the number of days the cricket lived.
  - Emergence: a category indicating early (E) or late (L) emergence relative to the median emergence date.

- Emergence definition:
  - Early emergence (E): emergence before the median emergence date.
  - Late emergence (L): emergence after the median emergence date.

- Variables and data interpretation:
  - Year: temporal context for the observation.
  - Lifespan: quantitative measure of duration of life in days.
  - Emergence: categorical division used to compare survival patterns by emergence timing.

- Data quality and standardization (Analyst perspective):
  - Assumes consistent categorization of Emergence (E/L) and accurate life-span calculations.
  - Suitable for quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation to standardized formats.
  - Outputs likely include tables, charts, and maps, with datasets stored in appropriate data portals.

- Analytical and monitoring use cases:
  - Compare survival between early vs late emergences within and across years.
  - Integrate with environmental data (e.g., temperature, habitat conditions) to explore factors influencing emergence timing and lifespan.
  - Support long-term environmental monitoring by tracking trends in emergence and survival cohorts.

- Data access and reuse considerations:
  - Emphasis on enabling access to underlying data to support transparency and reuse in environmental monitoring.
