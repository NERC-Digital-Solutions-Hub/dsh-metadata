# WildCrickets06G_EarlySearchingVsSurvival Description of content

## Overview
- Dataset describing individual male crickets with lifespan and early-life behavior.
- Purpose: relate early searching effort to survival, contributing to environmental monitoring by linking behavior to health outcomes.

## Variables and definitions
- Year: the year when the cricket was alive.
- Lifespan: total lifespan in days.
- EarlySearching: category of early-life searching effort for the individual cricket, labeled High (H) or Low (L).

## Classification rule
- EarlySearching is determined by comparing individual early-life searching effort to the population median.
  - High (H) if above the population median.
  - Low (L) if below the population median.

## How this supports environmental monitoring
- Enables analysis of how early behavioral effort relates to survival, informing interpretations of environmental conditions or resource availability.
- Produces standardized outputs (e.g., survival indicators by year and early-life behavior) suitable for reporting and trend assessment.

## Data quality and governance
- Implies a process of data understanding, verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation to enable standardized analysis.
- Designed for clear presentation in reports, maps, and charts, with datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.

## Practical considerations for analysts
- Facilitates combining this dataset with other relevant environmental or ecological data to enhance value beyond single-use analyses.
- Supports access to underlying data used to generate final outputs, aiding transparency and reproducibility in monitoring efforts.
