# WildCrickets06J_EarlyEmergenceVsSenescence Description of content

## Purpose and scope
- Describes singing activity per cricket sample and per individual male.
- Indicates whether the individual emerged early (before the population median) or late (after the population median) in the season.

## Data fields and meaning
- Emergence: E (emerged earlier) or L (emerged later).
- Year: year when the cricket was alive.
- ID: individual identification.
- Temp: ambient temperature at sampling (°C).
- Age: age at sampling (days).
- Sings: 1 if singing, 0 if not singing when sampled.

## Observational structure
- Data are recorded at the level of each sample and each identified male.

## How this supports environmental monitoring
- Provides phenology (early vs late emergence) and behavioral activity (singing) linked to temperature and age.
- Enables temporal comparisons (across years) and associations between environmental conditions and cricket life-history traits.

## Data quality and handling
- Should be verified, cleaned, and transformed using standardised methods.
- Outputs can be presented in formats suitable for reporting and visualization.
- Datasets should be stored and uploaded to the appropriate data portals.

## Integration and accessibility considerations
- Value increases when combined with other relevant datasets to avoid single-use limitations.
- Facilitate access to underlying data to support broader analysis and policy scrutiny.
