# WildCrickets06H_EarlyDominanceVsSurvival

## Dataset purpose
- Describes individual male crickets with lifespan classified by early-life fight dominance (high vs low) relative to the population median.
- Provides a simple, standardized set of fields to track survival and behavior over time.

## Variables and coding
- Year: calendar year in which the cricket was alive.
- Year alive: the year associated with the individual’s lifespan entry.
- Lifespan: number of days the cricket lived.
- EarlyDominance: High (H) or Low (L) dominance in early life, determined by whether early-life dominance is above or below the population median.

## How this supports environmental monitoring
- Enables standardized analysis of how early behavioral dominance relates to survival.
- Suitable for integration with other environmental data to explore drivers of lifespan and behavior.
- Outputs can be formatted as reports, charts, or maps, and stored in data portals for reuse.

## Data management and quality (per monitoring archetype)
- Understand and verify data sources and definitions (e.g., median-based dominance classification).
- Quality assure, clean, and transform data into standard formats.
- Produce outputs that categorize lifespan by EarlyDominance and summarize across years.

## Practical challenges and opportunities
- Increase dataset value by combining with related environmental datasets (e.g., temperature, resource availability).
- Improve accessibility by enabling access to underlying data used to create final outputs.
