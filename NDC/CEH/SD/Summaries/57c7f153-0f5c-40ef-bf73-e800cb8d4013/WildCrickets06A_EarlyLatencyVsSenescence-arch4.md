# WildCrickets06A_EarlyLatencyVsSenescence Description of content

- Purpose of dataset: Documents singing activity per cricket sample and per male, including the classification of mating latency as high or low relative to the population median (EarlyLatency).
- Key latency variable: Latency category labeled as High (H) or Low (L).
- Core fields:
  - Year: Year when the cricket was alive.
  - ID: Individual identification.
  - Temp: Ambient temperature at the time of sampling (in °C).
  - Age: Age of the cricket at sampling (in days).
  - Sings: Singing state at sampling (1 = singing, 0 = not singing).
  - EarlyLatency: Overall classification indicating whether mating latency is high or low.
