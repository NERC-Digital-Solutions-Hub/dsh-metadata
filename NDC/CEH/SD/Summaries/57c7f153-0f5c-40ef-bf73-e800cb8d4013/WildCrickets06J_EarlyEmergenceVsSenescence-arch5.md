# WildCrickets06J_EarlyEmergenceVsSenescence Description of content

- dataset describes singing activity per sample and per individual male, with a classification of early (E) or late (L) emergence relative to the population median in the season.
- aims to capture timing of emergence and related singing behavior to support ecological insights.

## Variables and data model

- Emergence: E (early) or L (late)
- Year: year when the cricket was alive
- ID: individual identifier
- Temp: ambient temperature at sampling, in degrees Celsius
- Age: age at sampling, in days
- Sings: whether the individual was singing at sampling (1) or not (0)

## Data collection and interpretation

- Observations are recorded per sample and per individual male.
- Emergence category defined relative to population median emergence timing.

## Data quality and standards

- Ensure consistent coding for categorical fields (E/L; 1/0 for Sings).
- Maintain clear units (Temp in °C) and age in days.
- Use a data dictionary and metadata to describe variables, units, and coding.
- Implement quality assurance steps to verify accuracy, consistency, and handling of any missing values.

## Metadata, provenance, and governance

- Document data collection methods, sampling context, and any transformations.
- Track data provenance and dataset versioning; note any updates or corrections.
- Catalog dataset in relevant data portals; maintain discoverability and interoperability.

## Sharing, access, and lifecycle

- Upload and catalogue datasets in appropriate portals; document work conducted (e.g., cleaning, transformations).
- Respect any data sharing limitations or embargoes; plan for ongoing updates and maintenance.
