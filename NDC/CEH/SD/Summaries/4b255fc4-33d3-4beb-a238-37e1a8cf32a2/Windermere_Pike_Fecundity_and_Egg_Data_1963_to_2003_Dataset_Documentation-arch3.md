# Windermere Pike Fecundity and Egg Data (1963 to 2003)

- Overview
  - Long-running dataset of fecundity, egg counts, and associated data for female pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
  - Data collected from 1963 to 2003; initially by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and since 1989 by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessor IFE.
  - Supports monitoring and evaluation of reproductive biology in a natural population, with potential to inform environmental health and policy decisions.

- Data file and structure
  - File: Windermere_Pike_Fecundity_and_Egg_Data_1963_to_2003.csv
  - Size: ~160 KB
  - Format: CSV
  - Columns:
    - YEAR, MONTH: Year and month of capture
    - LENGTH: Fork length of fish at capture (cm)
    - SOMATIC INDEX: Relative body condition factor (unitless)
    - EGG NUMBER: Estimated number of eggs per female
    - EGG WEIGHT: Estimated average weight of an egg (g)
  - Sampling site: Windermere Lake, with approximate OS grid references and coordinates
  - Species: Esox lucius (pike)

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Target population monitored in north and south basins via gill netting
  - Since 1982, standardised methodology:
    - 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets
    - Nets: 40 m long, 3 m deep; set on the lake bottom
    - Sampling window: mid-October to late December, at depths of ~4–5 m
    - Sites: 10 sites per basin; five nets at each site; sites rotated over the season
    - Frequency: two-week occupancy per site per season; annual sampling effort ~348 net days (1982–1989), ~240 net days (since 1990)
  - Historical period (pre-1982) used larger mesh and varied procedures; later standardised for comparability

- Collection and laboratory methods
  - In-field: pike measured (fork length to 1 mm), weighed (to 100 g), sexed; left opercular bone aged using Frost & Kipling (1959) method with birth date assumed 1 April
  - Female pike: fecundity (number of eggs) and ovary weight assessed as per Kipling & Frost (1969)
  - Somatic index: calculated as somatic weight divided by predicted somatic weight from population relationships (Edeline et al., 2007)

- Quality control and data quality
  - Quality control by repeating measurements on permutations of three individuals
  - References documenting methods and age/sexing techniques are provided to support traceability and reproducibility

- Data provenance and governance
  - Data rights: Database Right / Copyright © NERC - CEH / Freshwater Biological Association (FBA)
  - Dataset version: Document Version 1, dated 9-3-2015
  - Data stewardship involves data provenance, standardised methods, and clear documentation to facilitate reuse in monitoring and policy contexts

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a long-term, standardised time series of reproductive metrics
  - Enables assessment of reproductive capacity trends in relation to environmental factors (e.g., prey availability, temperature)
  - Demonstrates rigorous data collection, transformation, and quality assurance practices essential for informing environmental health monitoring and decision-making

- Practical considerations for use
  - Longitudinal comparability relies on standardised methods post-1982; pre-1982 data may require careful interpretation due to methodological differences
  - Metadata completeness is critical for verifying dataset suitability for specific monitoring questions (e.g., site coverage, sampling effort by year)
  - Accessibility is framed by copyright and data rights; users should reference the CEH/FBA custodians and accompanying documentation for data access and reuse terms
