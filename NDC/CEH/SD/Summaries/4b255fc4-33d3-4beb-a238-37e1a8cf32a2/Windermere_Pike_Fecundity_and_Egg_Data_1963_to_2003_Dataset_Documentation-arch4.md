# Windermere Pike Fecundity and Egg Data (1963 to 2003)

- A longitudinal dataset of fecundity, egg data, and associated measurements for female pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain, with data collected from 1963 to 2003.
- Original collection by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); since 1989, CEH and its predecessor Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) have continued collection and processing.

## Data file and format
- File: Windermere_Pike_Fecundity_and_Egg_Data_1963_to_2003.csv
- Size/format: 160 KB, comma separated values (CSV)
- Columns:
  - YEAR: Year of capture
  - MONTH: Month of capture
  - LENGTH: Length of fish at capture (cm)
  - SOMATIC INDEX: Relative body condition factor (unitless; defined by Edeline et al., 2007)
  - EGG NUMBER: Estimated number of eggs per female
  - EGG WEIGHT: Estimated average weight of an egg (g)
- Sampling site: Windermere Lake, Windermere, Cumbria; approximate center grid reference provided (OS grid and WGS84 coordinates)

## Scope and species
- Target species: Pike (Esox lucius)
- Focus: Female fecundity and ovarian weight as part of population and condition assessments
- Time span: Data spanning 1963–2003 (with sampling ongoing since 1944)

## Sampling design and regime
- Spatial coverage: North and south basins of Windermere; standardized sampling sites across basins
- Methodology evolution:
  - Pre-1982: Historical sampling with earlier net types and strategies
  - Since 1982: Standardised protocol using 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets, 40 m x 3 m nets
- Sampling timing: Nets set in late autumn to early winter (mid-October to late December); typical weekly cycle with rotation among sites
- Effort:
  - 1982–1989: Approximately 348 net days per year, distributed between basins
  - Since 1990: Approximately 240 net days per year, distributed evenly between basins
- Data capture at sea: All captured pike killed and sent to laboratory for processing

## Laboratory methods and measurements
- Measurements:
  - Fork length measured to 1 mm
  - Wet weight measured to 100 g
  - Sex determined; left opercular bone aged as per historical methods
  - Female pike: fecundity (number of eggs) and ovary weight measured
  - Somatic index calculated as somatic weight divided by predicted somatic weight (per Edeline et al., 2007)
- Ageing reference: Based on Frost & Kipling (1959) and related methodologies

## Quality control and documentation
- Quality control: Measurements validated by permutations involving three individuals
- Supporting analyses and literature:
  - References underpinning sampling and analyses include Kipling & Frost (1969), Frost & Kipling (1959), Winfield et al. (2008)
  - Data lineage and methodological notes summarized with associated literature

## Relevance for data-driven leadership and use cases
- Governance and discoverability: Clear provenance, standardised methods since 1982, and documented QC enable reliable data reuse and integration into broader fisheries or ecological data systems
- Metadata richness: Detailed measurement definitions, units, ageing method, and somatic index enable reproducibility and cross-study comparisons
- Potential applications:
  - Temporal trends in fecundity relative to body condition and size
  - Impacts of environmental changes (e.g., warming lake dynamics noted in related literature)
  - Data lineage tracing for cross-institution collaborations and meta-analyses
- Considerations for data leaders:
  - Ensure appropriate access controls given copyright and institutional ownership
  - Maintain metadata clarity around units, age determination, and somatic index calculations
  - Leverage standardized methodology to align with other long-term ecological datasets
  - Identify data gaps or needs for updates, and consider extending the dataset with newer years or complementary measures (e.g., environmental covariates)
