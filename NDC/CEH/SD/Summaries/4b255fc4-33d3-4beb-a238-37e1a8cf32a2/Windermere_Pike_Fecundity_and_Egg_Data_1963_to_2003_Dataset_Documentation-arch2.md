# Windermere Pike Fecundity and Egg Data (1963 to 2003)

## Overview
- Dataset of fecundity, egg numbers, and related data for female pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
- Time period: 1963 to 2003; data originally collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and since 1989 by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
- File: Windermere_Pike_Fecundity_and_Egg_Data_1963_to_2003.csv (CSV, 160 kb).
- Columns include: YEAR, MONTH, LENGTH (cm), SOMATIC INDEX, EGG NUMBER, EGG WEIGHT.
- Sampling site: Windermere Lake; approximate centre grid reference SD393960; coordinates provided in OSGB36 and WGS84.
- Species measured: Esox lucius (pike).

## Data Details and Variables
- YEAR and MONTH: capture time for individual fish.
- LENGTH: fork length at capture (cm).
- SOMATIC INDEX: relative body condition factor (unitless), per Edeline et al. (2007).
- EGG NUMBER: estimated fecundity (eggs) for each female pike.
- EGG WEIGHT: estimated average weight of an egg (grams).
- Taxon: Pike (Esox lucius).

## Sampling Design and Temporal Coverage
- Long-running monitoring in Windermere’s north and south basins via gill netting (1944–present periodally referenced).
- Since 1982: standardized methodology using 64 mm bar mesh, multifilament gill nets, 40 m x 3 m, deployed on the lake bottom.
- Sampling window: October to December, at depths of ~4–5 m.
- Spatial coverage: 10 sites per basin; nets set five at a time, with rotation to ensure full lake coverage.
- Sampling effort:
  - 1982–1989: ~348 net days/year (distributed roughly equally between basins).
  - Since 1990: ~240 net days/year (approximately equal between basins).

## Analytical Methods
- Laboratory processing:
  - Each pike measured (fork length to 1 mm) and weighed (to 100 g).
  - Sex determination performed; age determined from the left opercular bone with a nominal birth date of 1 April (as per Frost & Kipling, 1959).
  - For females: fecundity (egg number) and ovary weight determined (as per Kipling & Frost, 1969).
  - Somatic index calculated: ratio of somatic weight (total weight minus gonad weight) to predicted somatic weight from a population relationship (Edeline et al., 2007).
- Quality control: measurements cross-validated via permutations of three individuals.

## Quality Assurance and Data Use
- Long-term, standardized data collection enables temporal trend analysis in fecundity, body condition, and growth.
- Data quality is supported by established age-dating and fecundity methodologies and by routine QA practices.
- Dataset supports environmental monitoring objectives, especially in understanding reproductive responses to environmental factors (e.g., prey availability, lake warming) and population health.

## Potential Applications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Track temporal trends in pike fecundity and body condition as indicators of ecosystem health.
- Examine relationships between fish size, condition, and fecundity across decades.
- Compare north versus south basin dynamics to assess spatial heterogeneity within Windermere.
- Integrate with other environmental datasets (e.g., prey abundance, water temperature) to assess drivers of reproductive output.
- Provide standardized, long-term data to inform policy performance and conservation management related to freshwater ecosystems.
