# Windermere Pike Fecundity and Egg Data (1963 to 2003)

- A dataset of fecundity, egg and related data for female pike (Esox lucius) from net sampling.
- Timeframe: 1963 to 2003; initial collection by Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and since 1989 by CEH and predecessor IFE.
- Data file: Windermere_Pike_Fecundity_and_Egg_Data_1963_to_2003.csv (CSV, ~160 KB).

- Columns in the data:
  - YEAR, MONTH: year and month of capture
  - LENGTH: fork length of fish at capture (cm)
  - SOMATIC INDEX: relative body condition factor (unitless)
  - EGG NUMBER: estimated number of eggs per female
  - EGG WEIGHT: estimated average weight of an egg (g)
- Sampling site: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain (grid reference SD393960; OSGB36 Easting/Northing 339385,496080; coordinates 54.360193, -2.935836)

- Species measured: Esox lucius (Pike)

- Experimental design and sampling regime:
  - Pike monitored in north and south basins by gill netting; sampling sites and effort have varied since 1944, standardised since 1982.
  - Standardised method since 1982: 64 mm bar-mesh multifilament gill nets, 40 m x 3 m, used at 10 sites per basin, bottom-set between mid-October and late December, 4–5 m depth.
  - Five nets used simultaneously; sites rotated to cover the lake; each site fished for two weeks per season.
  - Annual sampling effort: ~348 net-days (1982–1989) with balanced basin coverage; ~240 net-days since 1990, balanced between basins.

- Collection methods and laboratory processing:
  - In the field, pikes measured (fork length to 1 mm) and weighed (to 100 g); sex determined.
  - Left opercular bone aged (birth date assumed 1 April).
  - Females: fecundity (egg number) and ovary weight measured.
  - Somatic index computed as somatic weight divided by predicted somatic weight from a population relationship (Edeline et al., 2007).

- Quality control:
  - Measurements quality-checked by permutations involving three individuals.

- Potential uses:
  - Investigating relationships between fecundity and body size, somatic condition, and egg characteristics.
  - Temporal trends and basin comparisons over 1963–2003.
  - Informing population dynamics and reproductive potential in Windermere pike.
