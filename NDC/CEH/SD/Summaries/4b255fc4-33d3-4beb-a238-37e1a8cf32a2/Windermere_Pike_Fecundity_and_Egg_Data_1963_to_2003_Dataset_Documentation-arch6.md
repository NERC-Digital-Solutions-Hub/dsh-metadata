# Windermere Pike Fecundity and Egg Data (1963 to 2003)

- Dataset of fecundity, egg data, and associated measurements for female pike (Esox lucius) from net sampling.
- Time span: 1963–2003; initial data collection by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA), continued by CEH and its predecessor IFE since 1989.
- Data file: Windermere_Pike_Fecundity_and_Egg_Data_1963_to_2003.csv (CSV, 160 KB).

## Data file details

- Columns:
  - YEAR: Year of capture
  - MONTH: Month of capture
  - LENGTH: Length of fish at capture (cm)
  - SOMATIC INDEX: Relative body condition factor (unitless)
  - EGG NUMBER: Estimated number of eggs for the individual
  - EGG WEIGHT: Estimated average weight of an egg (g)
- Measurements:
  - Fork length measured to 1 mm precision
  - Wet weight measured to 100 g precision
  - Female pike aged via left opercular bone with birth date assumed 1 April
  - Somatic index calculated as somatic weight (total weight minus gonad weight) divided by predicted somatic weight

## Location and scope

- Sampling site: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain
- Approximate lake centre coordinates: OS Grid SD393960; Easting 339385, Northing 496080 (OSGB36); at 54.360193°N, -2.935836°W (WGS84)
- Species: Esox lucius (pike)
- Timeframe: 1963–2003, with long-running sampling ongoing in Windermere since 1944

## Sampling design and fieldwork

- Basins: North and South Windermere
- Method: Gill netting with standardized protocol since 1982
- Net details (since 1982): 64 mm bar-mesh multifilament gill nets, 40 m length x 3 m depth
- Sampling window: October to late December; nets set on the bottom at ~4–5 m depth
- Sites and effort: 10 sites per basin; five nets deployed concurrently; sites rotated to cover lake; sampling at each site for two weeks per season
- Annual effort: ~348 net days (1982–1989), reduced to ~240 net days (since 1990), evenly distributed between basins
- Procedure: Nets set during daylight, checked and catch removed mid-week, lifted on a Friday; all pike killed and processed in the laboratory

## Analytical methods

- In-lab processing:
  - Pikes measured (fork length to 1 mm) and weighed (to 100 g)
  - Sex determined; left opercular bone removed for aging
  - Female fecundity determined (number of eggs) and ovaries weighed
- Data derived:
  - Somatic index as described above
- Key references underpinning methods include Frost & Kipling (1959, 1969) and Edeline et al. (2007), among others

## Quality control and provenance

- Quality control: measurements validated by permutations of three individuals
- Data provenance: longstanding collaboration between FBA and CEH/IFE; dataset used in analyses of pike population dynamics, body condition, and fecundity in relation to prey availability and environmental change
- Related analyses and references for methodology provided within the dataset documentation

## Usage notes

- Data are structured for self-contained analysis and cross-study comparability, with clearly defined units and age/dating conventions
- Suitable for analyses of fecundity trends, size–fecundity relationships, condition indices, and temporal population dynamics in Windermere pike
