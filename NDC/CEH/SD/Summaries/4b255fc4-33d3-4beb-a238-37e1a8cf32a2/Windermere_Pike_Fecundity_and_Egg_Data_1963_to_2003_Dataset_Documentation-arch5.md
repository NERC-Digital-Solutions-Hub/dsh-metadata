# Windermere Pike Fecundity and Egg Data (1963 to 2003)

## Overview
- A dataset of fecundity, egg and related data for female pike (Esox lucius) from net sampling in Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
- Data collection spans 1963 to 2003; originally collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and since 1989 by CEH and its predecessor IFE.

## Data content and format
- File: Windermere_Pike_Fecundity_and_Egg_Data_1963_to_2003.csv
- Size: approximately 160 KB
- Format: CSV

## Columns and definitions
- YEAR: Year of capture
- MONTH: Month of capture
- LENGTH: Length of fish at capture (cm)
- SOMATIC INDEX: Relative body condition factor (unitless), defined as somatic weight divided by predicted somatic weight (Edeline et al. 2007)
- EGG NUMBER: Estimated number of eggs per fish
- EGG WEIGHT: Estimated average weight of an egg (g)

## Sampling site and geography
- Location: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain
- Grid reference: OS Grid SD393960; Easting/Northing 339385,496080; coordinates 54.360193, -2.935836

## Species
- Esox lucius (Pike)

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Long-running monitoring in the lake’s north and south basins using gill nets
- Pre-1982: sampling varied across sites and effort
- Since 1982: standardized methodology
  - Net type: 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets
  - Net size: 40 m x 3 m
  - Deployment: on the bottom, between mid-October and late December, at depths ~4–5 m
  - Coverage: 10 sites per basin; five nets deployed simultaneously
  - Schedule: sites fished for two weeks per season; weekly rotation
  - Effort: ~348 net days/year (1982–1989) earlier; ~240 net days/year since 1990, distributed approximately equally between basins

## Collection, fieldwork and laboratory methods
- In the field: pike measured (fork length to 1 mm) and weighed (wet weight to 100 g); sex determination performed
- Ageing: left opercular bone aged per Frost & Kipling (1959) with birth date assumed 1 April
- Fecundity: female pike examined to determine fecundity (egg count) and ovary weight per Kipling & Frost (1969)
- Body condition: somatic index calculated as per Edeline et al. (2007)

## Quality control
- Measurements validated via permutations of three individuals for quality checks
- Methods and references cited for measurement and ageing procedures

## Data governance and stewardship considerations
- Metadata and provenance are explicit, supporting discovery and reuse
- Longitudinal data with standardized methods since 1982; pre-1982 data may require careful harmonization
- Licensing and rights indicate copyright restrictions; ensure compliant data sharing and attribution
- File naming and versioning should be maintained for traceability
- Ensure metadata covers measurement units, sampling design, and methods to support interoperability and reuse
- Consider updating or linking to additional metadata or repositories to improve discoverability and long-term preservation
