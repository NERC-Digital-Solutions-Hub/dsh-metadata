# Sampling Design

- Objective and context
  - Develop a village-level understanding of seasonal dynamics and forest resource use to monitor environmental health and inform management.
  - Explore how forest degradation (driven by charcoal production) affects resources and livelihoods across a gradient of conditions.
- Study area and sampling frame
  - Period: May 2014 to September 2014.
  - Study site: Mabalane district, Gaza province.
  - Village selection: Seven villages chosen along a forest degradation gradient (from abundant undisturbed forest to degraded forests) with similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation; purpose is to compare trends across different degradation stages.
- Seasonal calendar method
  - Participants: Mixed groups of 5–10 people per session; led by a researcher and a local-language assistant (Changana).
  - Resources and setup: 12 month cards, activity cards, stones/seeds; total 30 stones per activity to indicate relative intensity; required time: 1–2 hours.
  - Procedure:
    - Explain purposes: assess seasonality and changes in forest product availability/USE around the surrounding forest.
    - Identify main environmental services (ES) during participatory mapping (e.g., charcoal production, wood for charcoal, firewood, hunting).
    - Facilitate selection of time landmarks and illustrate a timeline on the ground.
    - Use stone-voting to depict abundance of each ES over historical time points (higher stones = greater abundance).
    - Prompt participants to forecast ES status 10 years into the future and review results for agreement.
    - For each ES, discuss factors driving changes, governance/permissions, access controls, sacred areas, substitutes, and impacts on daily life and other environmental conditions.
  - Outputs: Group-derived, time-indexed trends for ES; discussion notes on governance, access, and future projections.
- Data capture and key fields
  - Essential fields: Village name, date, number of participants, duration; men­tion of past changes (e.g., policy/licensing changes) and drivers (outsiders, new laws, licenses).
  - Trend analysis is conducted across ES to identify drivers and impacts on the environment and community.
- Village profiles and forest use (data collection framework)
  - Source: Interviews with village leaders and key informants; language support by Changana-speaking assistant.
  - Content areas:
    - Village profile: GPS, date, leader, age, function, duration of residence.
    - Village characteristics: structure (households, neighborhoods), education, health, water, land tenure (DUAT), migration, livelihoods (LH) activities, commercial activities (COM) by outsiders, market access.
    - Forest use and products: main forest products used, transformed, and traded; origin; who participates in production.
  - Commoditized ecosystem services (ES)
    - Charcoal: production location, sales, estimated quantity, licensing status, associations, chainsaws, outsiders, decision rights, external funding (e.g., government license revenue), community management structures.
    - Agriculture: main crops, productivity, farming practices (mashambas, home gardens), location and distance of fields, size, market sales, extension services.
    - Livestock: species, sale patterns, market destinations, pastures.
    - Others: additional marketable forest products.
  - Regulating services and disservices
    - Environmental condition indicators (rainfall, soil fertility, erosion).
    - Natural disasters or shocks (floods, pests, droughts, disease, conflicts, large forest loss) and affected groups.
  - Change and drivers
    - Social change: what has changed in the village, duration, and perceived direction.
    - Environmental change: changes in forest extent, flora and fauna, water availability/quality, soil; implications for daily life and beneficiaries.
    - Causes: deforestation, soil fertility loss, fires, market access, commercial agriculture, etc.
- Wealth ranking (household-level socio-economic assessment)
  - Purpose: Rank households by wealth to contextualize environmental use and access patterns.
  - Participants and leadership: conducted with village leaders, secretary, and other key figures; requires a reliable household list.
  - Process (approx. 2 hours):
    - Compile list of all households; place each name on a card.
    - Classify into four wealth classes: poorest, poor, better-off, rich.
    - Rank households within each class from richest to poorest; discuss and adjust as needed.
    - Collect qualitative criteria for ranking (attitudes, agriculture/livestock, housing/assets, education, nutrition/health, social relations).
    - Optional: rearrange households if necessary based on discussion.
  - Outputs: Wealth categorization and accompanying qualitative insights on how well-being relates to assets and ecosystem benefits.
- Data handling implications for an environmental monitoring analyst
  - Data quality and standardization: field protocol and bilingual materials support consistency across villages and sessions.
  - Outputs: datasets, maps, charts, and narrative summaries that track seasonal dynamics, ES trends, governance arrangements, and livelihoods.
  - Data storage and sharing: intention to store and upload created datasets to appropriate data portals; standardised formats and documentation needed to enable reuse.
  - Cross-dataset value: design of the methods supports combining ecological/degradation indicators with socio-economic and governance data to enhance the usefulness of the monitoring dataset and enable broader analysis over time and across gradients.
