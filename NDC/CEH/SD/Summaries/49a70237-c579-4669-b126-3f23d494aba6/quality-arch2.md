# Field protocols

- The fieldwork procedures are standardized and conducted in Portuguese to ensure consistency across exercises.

- Training and roles: initially the lead researcher works with one assistant/translator; before each exercise the assistant is trained on interview objectives and question delivery; eventually the assistant conducts exercises independently.

- Triangulation and focus: information is validated by discussing various topics with different groups, helping to highlight perspectives and refine interview focus with contextual insights.

- Group composition: the village leader organizes a participant group; focus groups include both men and women with inclusive invitation.

- Translation: a native-speaking translator accompanies the researcher; questions are translated between Portuguese and Changana as needed.

- Note taking: both the lead researcher and the assistant take notes.

- Post-interview discussion: after each interview, information is discussed with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding; clarification is sought from locals when needed.

- English transcription: notes are written in English back at the office, with the assistant’s notes in Portuguese translated to English.

- Backups: multiple backups are prepared for all documents.
