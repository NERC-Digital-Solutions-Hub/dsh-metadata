# Sampling Design

- Purpose and context
  - A field protocol to understand forest use, seasonality, and changes around villages in the Mabalane district, Gaza province, Mozambique.
  - Villages are selected along a forest degradation gradient (undisturbed to degraded due to charcoal production) to capture variation in resource availability and management.
  - Period: May 2014 to September 2014; study site features similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation to enable comparability.

- GIS-related objectives
  - Collect spatially explicit data to build map-based products: village locations, forest use patterns, and commodity flows.
  - Standardize data collection across sites to support consistent mapping and analysis.
  - Compile multi-resolution data (e.g., village profiles, resources, markets, licensing) for integrated GIS visualization.

- Village selection and study sites
  - Seven villages chosen to represent different stages of forest degradation, with comparable infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation.

- Seasonal calendar methodology
  - Participants: mixed groups of 5–10 people; led by a researcher and a local-language assistant (Changana); field protocol accommodates English/Portuguese versions.
  - Tools: 12 month cards, activity cards, 30 stones or seeds; time required: 1–2 hours per session.
  - Procedure:
    - Explain purposes (forest product availability and changes affecting village livelihoods).
    - Facilitate a fixed-stone voting exercise to depict the relative presence of activities across months (e.g., agricultural work, sowing, harvest, charcoal production).
    - Translate the number of stones into proportions for each time period.
    - Identify and illustrate seasonality across key ES (seasonal patterns of charcoal, wood availability, firewood, hunting, etc.).
    - Facilitate reflection on expected conditions 10 years ahead.
    - Review and adjust results with participants.
  - Outputs suitable for GIS: temporal distribution of key ES Activity intensities by month, enabling seasonality mapping and time-series analyses.

- Trend analysis and ES identification
  - Reiterates the need to anchor trends to time landmarks and ES categories (e.g., charcoal production, wood availability for charcoal, firewood, hunting).
  - Uses a group discussion format to capture perceived changes, drivers, and future projections.

- Village profiles and interview guidelines
  - Structure for data collection at village level:
    - Village name, GPS point, date, leader details, age, function, residency duration.
  - Village characteristics (multidimensional attributes):
    - STRUCTURE: households, village layout, leadership.
    - EDUCATION: schools, attendance, literacy.
    - HEALTH: health problems, health center, traditional healers.
    - WATER: boreholes, proximity.
    - LAND: land ownership (DUAT status).
    - MIGRATION: post-war dynamics, youth movement.
    - LH ACTIVITIES (livelihoods): main activities (charcoal, agriculture, livestock, others), start times.
    - COM ACTIVITIES: outsiders’ commercial activities, licensing context.
    - MARKET: nearest market, distance, frequency, primary products.
  - Forest use and origin of products:
    - List main forest products used, transformed, or traded (timber, charcoal, firewood, honey, bushmeat, medicinal plants).
    - Indicate origin and participant roles in production.
  - Commoditized ecosystem services (ES) and governance
    - Charcoal: production locations, sales, estimated quantities, licenses, associations, outside actors, governance (CGC), government revenue from licenses.
    - Agriculture: mashambas/fields, distance, size, main crops, productivity, external sales, extension services.
    - Livestock: key species, sales, pasture, and timing.
    - Others: any additional products traded.
  - Regulating services and disservices
    - Environmental conditions (rainfall, soil fertility, erosion).
    - Natural disasters or shocks (floods, pests, droughts, diseases, conflicts, forest loss), timing, and affected groups.
  - Change analysis
    - Social change: major shifts in village life; direction (better/worse).
    - Environmental change: notable environmental changes in the past decade and their implications for daily life.
    - Reasons for changes: drivers such as deforestation, soil fertility loss, market access, or large-scale land use changes.
  - Dual-language data capture
    - Fields appear in English and Portuguese (and Portuguese-like forms) to support bilingual data collection and analysis.

- Forest use and forest resource exploration (bilingual content)
  - Reiterates products, origins, and actors involved in forest resource use and trade, with detailed questions for governance and access.

- Wealth ranking (household-level socio-economic stratification)
  - Objective: rank all households within each village along four wealth classes defined as:
    - -- (poorest), - (poor), + (better-off), ++ (rich)
  - Process and participants
    - Guided by a researcher and a local-language assistant; led with leaders or key community members.
    - Requires a reliable household list.
    - Time: about 2 hours.
  - Steps
    - List all household names on cards.
    - Classify into four wealth categories.
    - Rank households within each category from richest to poorest.
    - Discuss differences and potential criteria guiding wealth (e.g., agriculture/livestock, housing/assets, education, nutrition/health, social relations).
    - Adjust rankings as needed and re-evaluate.
    - Explore how wellbeing has changed and its links to ecosystem benefits.
  - Outputs
    - A qualitative, group-informed wealth distribution profile to contextualize GIS-layered vulnerability and resilience analyses.

- Time, resources, and preconditions
  - Time: seasonal calendar sessions (1–2 hours each), wealth ranking (2 hours), village profiling and ES data collection can span multiple sessions.
  - Resources: calendar cards, activity cards, stones/seeds, household lists, translators, facilitators, GPS points, field protocol translations.
  - Precondition: reliable village household lists for wealth ranking; bilingual capacity (Changana with English/Portuguese versions).

- Language and protocol notes
  - Fieldwork conducted with local language support (Changana); translations into English and Portuguese provided to ensure consistency across sites.
  - Protocol emphasizes standardized questions and data capture for GIS-ready attributes, enabling cross-site comparability and spatial analyses.

- Practical implications for GIS Specialists
  - Provides a comprehensive, standardized data collection framework to produce georeferenced village profiles, ES distributions, resource flows (charcoal, agriculture, livestock), and market access.
  - Enables time-enabled mapping of seasonality and trend data, as well as socio-economic context through wealth classifications.
  - Supports integration of multiple data layers (environmental conditions, governance structures, licensing, and community-based management) into GIS dashboards and analyses.
