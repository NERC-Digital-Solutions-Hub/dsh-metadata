# Sampling Design

- Timeframe and location: May 2014 to September 2014; study site in Mabalane district, Gaza province. Seven villages were selected along a forest degradation gradient driven mainly by charcoal production, with similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation to capture variation in forest use and degradation.

- Objectives and approach:
  - Understand seasonality within villages and how forest products (e.g., charcoal, firewood) are available and used across different times.
  - Document changes in resource availability over recent years and how communities adapt.
  - Establish village profiles and collect data on forest use, governance, and livelihoods to inform management decisions.

- Seasonal calendar and data collection method:
  - Group discussions (5–10 participants) led by a researcher and a local-language assistant (Changana); sessions typically 1 hour.
  - Tools: 12 month cards, activity cards, stones/seeds as proxies, and a fixed total of 30 stones to allocate across months to reflect the relative abundance of activities.
  - Procedure captures seasonality (e.g., rainy vs. harvest periods) and key activities (agriculture, sowing, harvesting, charcoal production, fruit bearing, hunger period).
  - Translation and field protocol followed; notes collected for cross-village comparisons (one calendar per area south/north of Mabalane if needed).

- Data collection components and village profiling:
  - Village profiles created from leader interviews and participatory exercises; fields include:
    - Village name, GPS point, date, leader details, and residency duration.
  - Village characteristics documented across multiple domains:
    - STRUCTURE: household numbers, village structure (neighborhoods), leadership, and distribution.
    - EDUCATION: schools, top education level, attendance.
    - HEALTH: main health problems, health center, traditional health practitioners.
    - WATER: boreholes, distance to water sources.
    - LAND: land rights status (DUAT).
    - MIGRATION: post-war and current migration patterns.
    - LH ACTIVITIES (livelihoods): charcoal, agriculture, livestock, others; presence of outsiders and started timing.
    - COM ACTIVITIES: outsider involvement in commercial activities (charcoal, agriculture, livestock); licensing context.
    - MARKET: nearest market, travel distance, frequency, principal products.

- Forest use and governance data:
  - FOREST USE: main forest products used, transformed, and traded; origin of products; actors involved in production.
  - COMMODITIZED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (ES):
    - CHARCOAL: production location, sale points, estimated quantities, licensing, associations, chainsaws, outsiders, governance, and community compensation (e.g., government revenue shares) and community governance structures (e.g., Community Forest Management Council).
    - AGRICULTURE: primary crops, farm locations (mashambas), distance to fields, field size, productivity, markets for produce, and presence of extension services.
    - LIVESTOCK: main animals, sale patterns, and pasture locations.
    - OTHERS: additional marketable forest products.
  - REGULATING SERVICES AND DISDISERVICES:
    - ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS: observed changes in rainfall, soil fertility, erosion, etc., over the last decade.
    - NATURAL DISASTER: history of disasters or shocks (floods, pests, droughts, disease, conflicts, major forest loss) and affected groups.

- Change assessment:
  - SOCIAL CHANGE: major social shifts in the village, timing, and whether conditions improved or worsened.
  - ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE: notable environmental changes over recent years and their implications for daily life; who benefits or loses.
  - REASONS: primary drivers of observed changes (e.g., deforestation, soil loss, market access, commercial agriculture).

- Wealth ranking (household-level socioeconomics):
  - Purpose: rank all households in each village into four wealth classes (poorest, poor, better-off, rich) using a quick, controlled exercise.
  - Process: uses a reliable household list; 2-hour session with leaders and designated participants.
  - Steps:
    - Compile all household names on cards.
    - Classify into four wealth categories and rank within each category.
    - Discuss differences using inductively derived criteria (e.g., farming and livestock, housing, assets, education, health, social relations).
    - Adjust rankings as needed.
    - Pose post-ranking questions on well-being trends and links to ecosystem benefits.
  - Key characteristics for classification include working attitude, agriculture and livestock, housing/assets, education, nutrition/health, and social relations.
