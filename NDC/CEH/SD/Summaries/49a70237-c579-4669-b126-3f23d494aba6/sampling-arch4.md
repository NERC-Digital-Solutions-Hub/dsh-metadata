# Sampling Design

## Overview
- Period: May 2014 to September 2014
- Study site: Mabalane district, Gaza province
- Purpose: Understand forest-resource seasonality, usage, and changes; assess how forest degradation and charcoal production affect local livelihoods and forest management

## Study site and village selection
- Forest degradation gradient used to select villages, from abundant undisturbed forest to degraded forests (mainly due to charcoal production)
- Seven villages chosen at different gradient points with similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation types

## Seasonal calendar and data collection design
- Seasonal calendar exercises to capture village seasonality
  - Group discussions (5–10 participants), 1 hour per session
  - Led by a researcher and a Changana-speaking assistant
  - Materials: 12 month cards, activity cards, stones/seeds
  - Fixed 30 stones/seed units to allocate across months to indicate relative activity levels
- Purpose of calendar: identify period-by-period activity patterns (e.g., agricultural activities, rainfall, harvest)
- Documentation fields: village name, date, number of participants, duration

## Trend analysis and elicitation process
- Similar group sessions used to discuss historical trends
- Focus on forest products (e.g., charcoal, wood availability for charcoal, firewood, hunting)
- For each product: identify past start or key change points, then depict abundance over time using the stone-voting method
- Later, discuss expected future state (e.g., 10 years ahead) and review results with participants
- Follow-up questions cover:
  - Who collects/produces the product
  - Controls and permissions
  - Sacred areas or external restrictions
  - Factors driving changes and effects on other ecological conditions
  - Availability of preferred materials, substitutes, and impacts on daily life
  - Community actions to address trends

## Village profiles and governance data
- Village profiles collected via leader/interview
  - Village name, GPS point, date, leader name, age, function, years in village
- Village characteristics (structure, education, health, water, land, migration, livelihoods, external actors, market)
- Forest use data
  - Main natural products used, transformed, or traded
  - Origins and who is involved in production

## Commoditized ecosystem services (ES)
- CHARCOAL
  - Production and sale locations, estimated quantity, licenses, associations
  - Presence of chainsaws, external actors, and decision-makers
  - Community governance (e.g., community management council) and government revenue flow (e.g., 20% license)
- AGRICULTURE
  - Main crops, mashamba/horticulture practices, field distances and sizes
  - Market activity and presence of extension agents
- LIVESTOCK
  - Main animals, sale outlets, timing, and pasture arrangements
- OTHERS
  - Other forest products marketed

## Regulating services and disservices
- Environmental conditions observed over the last 10 years (rainfall, soil fertility, erosion)
- Natural disasters or shocks (floods, pests, droughts, diseases, conflicts, large forest loss)
- Impacts and distribution of effects among villagers

## Change and drivers
- SOCIAL CHANGE: What has changed most in the village; timing; perceived improvements or declines
- ENV CHANGE: Environmental changes (forest area, flora/fauna, water availability/quality, soil quality) and implications for daily life; beneficiaries and losers; expected future changes
- REASONS: Key drivers behind changes (e.g., deforestation, soil fertility loss, market access, commercial agriculture)

## Wealth ranking
- All households ranked within each study village by wealth
- Participants: village leadership group (leader, secretary, regulo)
- Process (2 hours): list households, classify into four wealth classes (poorest, poor, better-off, rich), rank within classes, discuss criteria
- Potential criteria include: working attitude, agriculture and livestock, housing/assets, education, nutrition/health, social relations
- Precondition: reliable household list
- Outcome: contextual understanding of well-being and links to ecosystem benefits

## Language, data management, and field protocol
- Fieldwork conducted with language support (Changana), with versions in English and Portuguese
- Field protocol followed to ensure consistency and replicability
- Data elements documented include exact village identifiers, dates, participant counts, and duration for traceability and future updates

## Practical implications for Data Leaders
- Captures both quantitative-like proxies (stone allocations, цен) and qualitative narratives across multiple villages and timeframes
- Emphasizes participatory, user-informed data collection to reflect local seasonality and governance realities
- Highlights data governance needs: standardization across languages, metadata for village profiles, licensing/association information, and robust household lists for wealth assessments
- Provides a replicable framework for building a multilayer dataset on forest use, governance, and socio-economic change to inform policy and community-based management across networks.
