# Field protocols

- Field protocols were prepared in Portuguese for each exercise, ensuring language alignment with local contexts.
- Training of assistant/translator: initially the lead researcher worked with one assistant; the assistant was trained on interview objectives and question delivery before each exercise, and later conducted exercises independently.
- Triangulation and focusing: multiple topics discussed with different groups to validate information and gain diverse perspectives; context from interviews and focus groups helped progressively refine interview focus.
- Composition of group: village leader recruited participants; focus groups included both men and women, with inclusive invitations to contribute.
- Translation: a translator/assistant fluent in the local language supported, translating between Portuguese and Changana as needed.
- Note taking: coordinated by the lead researcher and the assistant.
- Discussion: post-interview review with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding; clarifications sought with locals when needed.
- Transcript in English: field notes recorded in English upon returning to the office; assistant notes in Portuguese translated into English.
- Back-up: multiple backups created for all documents to safeguard data.

## Implications for Data Leaders

- Emphasizes multilingual data collection and translation accuracy as essential for data quality and inclusivity.
- Demonstrates rigorous data validation through triangulation and iterative focusing across diverse groups.
- Highlights the importance of clear role delineation (lead researcher and trained assistant) and ongoing training for data collection integrity.
- Underlines robust documentation practices (notes, translations, transcripts, and backups) to maintain a transparent audit trail and data discoverability.
- Illustrates inclusive group composition and ethical considerations in engaging diverse participants.

## Practical takeaways for data strategy

- Build field protocols in the local language and ensure translator support is trained and integrated.
- Use triangulation and iterative focus to enhance data validity and relevance to user needs.
- Maintain meticulous documentation and backups to support data governance, metadata, and future reuse.
