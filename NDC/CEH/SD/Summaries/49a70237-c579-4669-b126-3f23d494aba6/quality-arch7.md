# Field protocols and data handling procedures for interviews

- Field protocols were prepared in Portuguese for each exercise to guide data collection.

- Training of assistant/translator: Initially conducted with the lead researcher and one assistant; the assistant was trained on interview objectives and question delivery and later conducted exercises independently.

- Triangulation and focusing: Repeated discussions with different groups and individuals to validate information from multiple perspectives; contextual information from interviews and focus groups helped refine interview focus.

- Composition of group: Village leader usually recruited participants; focus groups included men and women with inclusive invitation to contribute.

- Translation: A translator/assistant fluent in the local language accompanied the researcher; questions translated between Portuguese and Changana as needed.

- Note taking: Carried out by the lead researcher and the assistant.

- Discussion: Post-interview discussions with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding and seek clarification from locals when needed.

- Transcript in English: Notes were written in English after fieldwork; assistant notes were recorded in Portuguese and translated to English.

- Back-up: Multiple backups were prepared for all documents to safeguard data.
