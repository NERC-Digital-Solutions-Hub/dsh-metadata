- Field protocols were prepared in Portuguese to guide each exercise.

- Training of assistant/translator: initially, the lead researcher and one assistant/translator conducted exercises together; before each exercise, the assistant was trained on objectives and question delivery; later, the trained assistant conducted exercises independently.

- Triangulation and focusing: repeatedly discussing topics with different groups/persons to validate information; contextual information from interviews and focus groups helped sharpen focus over time.

- Composition of group: village leader typically gathered a group as requested; focus groups included both men and women, with explicit invitation for everyone to contribute.

- Translation: a translator/assistant fluent in the local language accompanied the researcher; questions were translated between Portuguese and Changana as needed.

- Note taking: notes were recorded by the lead researcher and the assistant.

- Discussion: after each interview, information was discussed with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding; clarification sought from locals if needed.

- Transcript in English: notes taken by the assistant in Portuguese were translated to English; in-office notes were written in English.

- Back-up: multiple backups were prepared for all documents.
