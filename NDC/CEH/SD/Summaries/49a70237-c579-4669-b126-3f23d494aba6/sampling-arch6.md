# Sampling Design

## Overview
- Timeframe: May 2014 to September 2014
- Study site: Mabalane district, Gaza province
- Village selection: 7 villages along a forest degradation gradient (from undisturbed to degraded forests driven by charcoal production); similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation to enable comparison

## Seasonal calendar data collection
- Purpose: understand seasonality within a village; may require one seasonal calendar for the south of Mabalane and one for the north
- Participants: mixed groups of 5–10 people
- Facilitation: led by a researcher and a locally fluent assistant (Changana)
- Process and resources:
  - 12 month cards; activity cards; stones/seeds; 1–2 hours
  - Group discussion to allocate 30 stones/seeds across months to reflect activity intensity
  - Fixed total stones allow conversion to proportions later
- Outputs:
  - Seasonal timing for key activities (rainy season, agricultural activities, sowing, harvest, fruiting, hunger period, charcoal production, etc.)
  - A structured calendar linking months to activity intensity

## Trend analysis and structuring data collection
- Procedures repeated in group discussions to capture changes over time for forest-related ES
- Documentation fields requested during sessions:
  - Village name, date, number of participants, duration
  - Explanation of purposes and the ES to discuss (charcoal production, wood for charcoal, firewood, hunting, etc.)
  - Time landmark prompts to identify past change points (e.g., licences, outsiders, new laws)
  - Abundance depicted via the 30-stone voting exercise
  - Projections for the next 10 years
  - Review and agreement on results
- ES-focused discussion prompts:
  - Who collects/produces? Who controls or permissions? Sacred areas?
  - Factors driving changes, and secondary effects on ecosystem conditions
  - Availability of preferred materials and substitutes
  - Impacts on daily life and potential community actions

## Village profiles (qualitative baseline)
- Data collection through interviews with village leaders or key persons (Changana-speaking)
- Village profile fields:
  - Village name, GPS point, date, leader name, age, function, residence duration
  - Village characteristics: structure (household numbers, neighborhoods, leadership), education, health, water, land (DUAT), migration, livelihood activities (charcoal, agriculture, livestock), external/commercial activities, market access
  - Forest use: main products (timber, charcoal, firewood, honey, game meat, medicinal plants), origin, participants in production
  - Commoditized ES:
    - Charcoal: production location, sale location, estimated quantity, licensing status, associations, chainsaws, external involvement, who decides production, governance, government revenue (e.g., 20% license), Community-Managed Resource Council (CGC)
    - Agriculture: major crops, productivity, mashambas/fields, distance, size, off-village sales, extension presence
    - Livestock: main species, sale patterns, pastures
    - Other products
  - Regulating services and disservices: environmental conditions (rainfall, soil fertility, erosion), natural disasters/crises (floods, pests, droughts, disease, conflicts, forest loss) and timing
  - Change section: social and environmental changes, meaning for households, beneficiaries vs. non-beneficiaries, future village trajectory, driving reasons (e.g., deforestation, soil fertility loss, market access)
  - Wealth ranking context and dynamics (see Wealth Ranking section)

## Forest use and governance data (open-ended structure)
- Forest product categories (mainly used/processed/trafficked and origin)
- Stakeholders involved in production and trade
- Specific focus on charcoal (production site, sale, licenses, associations, outsiders, governance, revenue sharing)
- Specific focus on agriculture and livestock practices (locations, productivity, markets, extension services)
- Environmental risk indicators (disasters and shocks) and their impacts

## Commoditized ecosystem services (ES)
- Charcoal
  - Production location, sale location, quantity (estimated sacks)
  - Licensing status, associations, presence of chainsaws, outside entrants
  - Decision-makers for production, governance, and whether the village receives government revenue
  - Existence of a Community Governance/Management Council (CGC) and its role
- Agriculture
  - Main crops, field locations (mashamba), distance, average size, productivity
  - Market/outside sales and extension services presence
- Livestock
  - Key species, sale patterns, timing, and pasture management
- Others
  - Any additional forest-derived products commercialized

## Regulating services and disservices
- Environmental condition observations over the last 10 years (rainfall, soil fertility, erosion)
- Exposure to natural disasters or crises (floods, pests, droughts, diseases, conflicts, large forest loss)
- Timing and who was most affected

## Change and drivers
- Social change: most notable shifts in the village and timing; perceived improvement or decline
- Environmental change: significant recent changes in forest area, flora/fauna, water availability/quality, soil quality; implications for households and daily life
- Reasons for changes: e.g., market access, commercial activities, deforestation, soil fertility loss, fire, etc.

## Wealth ranking (participatory)
- Purpose: rank all households by wealth to contextualize resilience and relative well-being
- Participants: leadership group (leader, secretary, regulo) and, where possible, broader participation
- Process (2 hours): 
  - List all households on cards
  - Classify into four wealth categories: poorest, poor, better-off, rich
  - Rank households within each category from richest to poorest
  - Elicit criteria for ranking (education, assets, housing, agriculture, nutrition, social relations)
  - Adjust categorization if needed
  - Discuss changes in well-being and links to ecosystem benefits
- Output: a wealth strata framework to interpret other data and changes

## Time and resource requirements
- Time: Seasonal calendar (1–2 hours per village session) + trend discussions + village profiling + wealth ranking
- Resources: household lists, month/activity cards, ES/participation prompts, translator/facilitator, recording materials

## Key challenges and considerations for data use
- Requires reliable household lists for wealth ranking
- Managing diverse formats and languages (local language facilitation)
- Ensuring consistent interpretation of qualitative data across villages
- Translating stone-voting results into quantitative indicators (proportions, trends)
- Balancing depth of data with practical time constraints in field settings
