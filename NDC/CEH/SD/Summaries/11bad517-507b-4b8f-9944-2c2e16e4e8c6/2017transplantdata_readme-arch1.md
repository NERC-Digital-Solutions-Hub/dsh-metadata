# Data collected on Mt Etna in 2017

## Overview
- 2017 field transplant study: cuttings taken from genotypes in natural populations, propagated in a glasshouse, then transplanted to four elevations.
- Collected data on plant survival and leaf morphology.

## Variables
- Species: AE = Senecio aethnensis; CH = S. chrysanthemifolius
- Genotype: genotype ID from individuals in natural populations
- Site: source site of genotypes
  - AE: ES = Etna South; EN = Etna North
  - CH: five sites around Mt. Etna base
- Altitude: elevation of source populations
- TGSite: elevation of transplant sites
- TGBlock: replicate field blocks
- Grid: grid location within each block; genotype randomized to grid locations
- Survival.09.09: survival after Summer (to 9 September)
- Survival.April.18: survival after winter (to following spring)
- totaldays: total days each plant survived (used for survival analysis)
- Censor: censor day at end of experiment (used for survival analysis)
- Height: plant height (mm)
- LeafWeight: total leaf weight (g)
- nleaves: number of leaves measured
- Area: leaf area (mm2)
- P2A: leaf complexity (perimeter squared divided by area)
- Nind: number of indentations divided by perimeter
- IndentWidth: width of leaf indentations
- IndentDepth: depth of leaf indentations
- Circularity: how close the leaf is to a circle
- SLA: specific leaf area (area divided by weight)

## Data processing and notes
- Leaf morphology calculated using the software Lamina.
- NA entries represent plants for which survival data were collected but the plant died before leaves could be sampled.
