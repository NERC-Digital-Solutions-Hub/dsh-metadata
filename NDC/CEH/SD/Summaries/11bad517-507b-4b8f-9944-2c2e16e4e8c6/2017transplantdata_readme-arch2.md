# Data collected on Mt Etna in 2017

## Overview
- Field transplant experiment conducted in 2017 using two Senecio species: AE = S. aethnensis and CH = S. chrysanthemifolius.
- Cuttings taken from natural populations, propagated in a glasshouse, then transplanted at four elevations.
- Data collected include survival metrics and leaf morphology measurements.

## Variables
- Species: AE (S. aethnensis) and CH (S. chrysanthemifolius)
- Genotype: genotype ID from individuals in natural populations
- Site (source): AE sources from ES = Etna South, EN = Etna North; CH from five sites around Mt. Etna base
- Altitude: elevation of the sampled (source) sites
- TGSite: elevation of the transplant sites
- TGBlock: replicate experimental blocks in the field
- Grid: grid location of plants within each block (genotype randomized to grid positions)
- Survival.09.09: survival after Summer (to 9 September)
- Survival.April.18: survival after winter (to spring the following year)
- totaldays: total days each plant survived (used for survival analysis)
- Censor: censor day at end of experiment (used for survival analysis)
- Height: plant height (mm)
- LeafWeight: total leaf weight (g)
- nleaves: number of leaves measured
- Area: leaf area (mm2)
- P2A: leaf complexity (perimeter squared divided by area)
- Nind: number of indents divided by perimeter
- IndentWidth: width of leaf indentations
- IndentDepth: depth of leaf indentations
- Circularity: how close the leaf is to a circle
- SLA: specific leaf area (leaf area divided by weight)

## Measurements and methodology
- Leaf morphology calculated using the software Lamina
- Notes:
  - NA indicates plants for which survival data were collected but that died before leaves were sampled

## Notes
- Leaf morphology calculations were performed with Lamina software
- NA entries denote plants with survival data but no leaf measurements due to early mortality
