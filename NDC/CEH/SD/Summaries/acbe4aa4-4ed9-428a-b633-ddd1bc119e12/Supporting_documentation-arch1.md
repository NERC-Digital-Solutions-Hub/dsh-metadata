# Feather isotope ratios and sexing of oystercatchers breeding in Iceland

## Study design
- Conducted across southern to northeastern Iceland during summers 2013–2017.
- Incubating oystercatchers captured on nests using a spring trap; birds marked with uniquely numbered metal rings and colour rings.
- For each bird, collected 4–5 chest feathers (grown on wintering sites during pre-nuptial moult) for isotopic analysis.
- A subset of birds also had blood samples collected for molecular sex determination.
- Chest feather isotopes reflect diet and habitat during the wintering period when the feathers grew.

## Data files and contents
- OystercatcherFeatherIstotopes.csv
  - Contains data for 552 oystercatchers captured and sampled while breeding in Iceland.
  - Columns include: Year (2013–2017), Individual ID, d15N (nitrogen isotope ratio), d13C (carbon isotope ratio), Status (Migrant, Unknown, or Resident), WinterLocation (country observed during winter).
  - Describes the stable isotope analysis workflow and measurement context.
- OystercatcherSexing.csv
  - Contains data for 321 oystercatchers tested for molecular sex.
  - Columns include: Individual ID, DNA-derived sex.
  - Describes the molecular sexing approach used to assign sex.

## Isotopic analysis methods
- Feather preparation: washed in 2:1 chloroform/methanol, dried, cut into fragments.
- Sample mass: 0.45–0.55 mg per fragment; packed in tin capsules.
- Instrumentation: combustion elemental analyser connected to a Thermo Scientific Delta XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer.
- Isotope reporting: δ13C (V-PDB) and δ15N (AIR N2) as per mil (‰) deviations.
- Quality control: internal standard (collagen) measurements yield errors of 0.2‰ for δ13C and 0.1‰ for δ15N.
- Interpretation: isotopic ratios reflect diet/habitat during the wintering period when the chest feathers grew.

## Sexing methods
- DNA extraction from blood using an ammonium acetate technique; diluted to 10–50 ng/μL.
- Sex determination using the universal molecular method described by Fridolfsson & Ellegren (1999) for non-ratite birds.

## Context and provenance
- Associated with NERC Grant NE/M012549/1: Environmental and demographic drivers of migratory strategies in birds.
- Focuses on understanding migratory strategies by linking isotopic signatures and sex to wintering locations and statuses.
