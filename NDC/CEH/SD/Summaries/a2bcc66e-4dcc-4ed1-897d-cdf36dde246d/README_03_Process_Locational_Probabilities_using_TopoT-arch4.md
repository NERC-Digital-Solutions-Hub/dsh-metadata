# 03_Process_Locational_Probabilities_using_TopoToolbox_SWATHobj

## Overview
- A MATLAB-based toolset to process along-valley locational probability using TopoToolbox SWATHobj.
- Produces visual outputs in the form of barcodes and cumulative distribution function (CFD) plots to aid interpretation.

## What’s Included
- Code and supporting files to perform the processing.
- A MATLAB script/file named Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt containing the run instructions.

## How It Works
- Utilizes TopoToolbox SWATHobj to compute locational probabilities along a valley profile.
- Generates informative plots (barcodes and CFDs) to visualize probability along the valley.

## Requirements
- MATLAB environment.
- TopoToolbox toolbox installed.
- Access to SWATHobj data structures.
- The Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt file for execution guidance.

## Outputs
- Plots: barcodes representing locational likelihoods and CFD plots for probability distribution along the valley.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Supports reproducible, transparent processing of spatial probability data within a broader data workflow.
- Facilitates standardization of locational probability analyses and sharing of results through runnable code and documented steps.
- Encourages integration of this processing step into data governance practices, ensuring input data provenance, software/tool versions, and resulting plots are traceable and reusable.
