## Overview
- Provides code and files to process along-valley locational probability using TopoToolbox SWATHobj.
- Produces plots, specifically barcodes and CFDs.

## What is included
- MATLAB workflow and supporting files to perform the processing.
- A MATLAB script named Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt to run the process.

## How to run
- Requires MATLAB.
- Run the Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt script to execute the processing and generate outputs.

## Outputs
- Processed along-valley locational probabilities.
- Visualizations: barcodes and CFDs.
