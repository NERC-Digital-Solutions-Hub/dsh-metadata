# 03_Process_Locational_Probabilities_using_TopoToolbox_SWATHobj

- Purpose: A MATLAB-based workflow to process along-valley locational probability using TopoToolbox SWATHobj.
- What’s included: Code and files to perform the processing.
- Outputs: Plots of barcodes and CFDs (as part of the locational probability analysis).
- How to run: Use the MATLAB code specified in Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt to execute the workflow.
- Context: Targets analysts working with geospatial/topographic data to quantify and visualize locational probabilities along valleys.
