# 03_Process_Locational_Probabilities_using_TopoToolbox_SWATHobj

## Overview
- Provides a MATLAB-based workflow to compute along-valley locational probabilities using TopoToolbox SWATHobj.
- Generates visual outputs, specifically barcodes and CFDs (likely cumulative distribution/frequency plots) to accompany the probability results.

## What is Included
- Code and supporting files to perform the along-valley locational probability processing.
- MATLAB script/code file required to run the workflow: Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt.
- Tools rely on TopoToolbox SWATHobj for the calculations and plotting.

## How to Use
- Run the MATLAB code provided (Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt).
- Ensure the environment has MATLAB and the TopoToolbox SWATHobj components available.

## Outputs
- Computed locational probabilities along valleys.
- Plots: barcodes and CFDs illustrating the results for interpretation and communication.

## Requirements and Dependencies
- MATLAB.
- TopoToolbox (specifically SWATHobj functionality) referenced by the workflow.

## Relevance for GIS Specialists
- Enables creation of map-based data products showing spatial probabilities along valley corridors.
- Supports visualization-ready outputs (barcodes, CFDs) suitable for reporting to policy colleagues, clients, or the public.
- Fits into GIS workflows by providing a reproducible, code-driven method to transform raw data into interpretable spatial probability visuals.
