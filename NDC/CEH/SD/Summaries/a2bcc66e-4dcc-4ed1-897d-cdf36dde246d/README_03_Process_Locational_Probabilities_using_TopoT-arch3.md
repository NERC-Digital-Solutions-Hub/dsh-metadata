# 03_Process_Locational_Probabilities_using_TopoToolbox_SWATHobj

## Overview
- A MATLAB-based workflow to process along-valley locational probabilities using TopoToolbox SWATHobj.
- Produces visual outputs, specifically barcodes and CFDs.

## Contents
- Includes code and supporting files necessary for the processing.
- MATLAB script/file: Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt.

## Usage
- Run the MATLAB code from Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt within MATLAB.
- Requires MATLAB and the TopoToolbox toolbox (with SWATHobj functionality).

## Outputs
- Plots of locational probabilities in the form of barcodes and CFDs.

## Dependencies and Implementation Notes
- Dependency on MATLAB and TopoToolbox SWATHobj.
- Ensure version compatibility and proper setup of TopoToolbox for successful execution.
