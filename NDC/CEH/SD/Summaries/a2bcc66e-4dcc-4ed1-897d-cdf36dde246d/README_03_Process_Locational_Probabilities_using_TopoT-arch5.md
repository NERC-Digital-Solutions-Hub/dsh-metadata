# 03_Process_Locational_Probabilities_using_TopoToolbox_SWATHobj

## Overview
- Provides code and supporting files to process along-valley locational probability using TopoToolbox SWATHobj.
- Produces visual outputs: plots of barcodes and CFDs.

## Contents
- TopoToolbox SWATHobj workflow files for processing locational probabilities.
- MATLAB script/file: Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt to run the process.

## Execution requirements
- MATLAB environment is required to run the code.
- Script Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt contains the steps to execute the workflow.

## Data governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Metadata: document inputs, outputs, methods, and processing steps.
- Provenance and versioning: record the origins of the code and the SWATHobj/toolbox versions used.
- Licensing: verify and record licenses for code and software tools.
- Reproducibility: specify required MATLAB version, TopoToolbox version, and any dependencies; provide a reproducible run recipe.
- Access and distribution: ensure appropriate access controls align with licensing; manage distribution of the code and data.
- Discoverability and storage: catalog the files with clear descriptions and maintainable metadata.

## Risks and recommendations
- MATLAB dependence may limit accessibility; consider alternative platforms or provide open equivalents if possible.
- Compatibility with TopoToolbox/SWATHobj versions may affect reproducibility; include environment setup details.
- Include a readme with setup instructions, input data requirements, and example runs to facilitate reuse.
