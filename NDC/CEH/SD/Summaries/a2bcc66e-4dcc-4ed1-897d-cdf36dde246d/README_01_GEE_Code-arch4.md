## Files included
- GEE_Code_Abulug_Deprecated.txt: original code using Landsat Collection 1 (now deprecated).
- GEE_Code_Abulug_Migrated.txt: modified code migrated to Landsat Collection 2.

## Data standards and migration
- Migration from Landsat Collection 1 (deprecated) to Landsat Collection 2 to align with current data standards and availability.

## Implications for data governance
- Demonstrates deprecation and migration of data sources to maintain relevance and compatibility.
- Highlights the importance of updating pipelines and accompanying documentation when data sources change.

## Actions for data leaders
- Verify that analyses use the migrated (Collection 2) code for up-to-date data.
- Update metadata to reflect the data source version (Collection 2) and keep records of deprecated references.
- Review and test outputs at 2-year intervals to ensure continuity and reproducibility.
