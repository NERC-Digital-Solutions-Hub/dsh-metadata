# 03_Process_Locational_Probabilities_using_TopoToolbox_SWATHobj Includes code and files to process along-valley locational probability using TopoToolbox SWATHobj and creates plots (barcodes and CFDs). Need to run the MATLAB code (Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt)

## Purpose
- Provides a workflow to compute along-valley locational probabilities using TopoToolbox SWATHobj and generate diagnostic plots.

## What’s Included
- Code and associated files for processing.
- MATLAB script/file: Abulug_TopoToolbox_Code.txt to run the analysis.

## How to Use
- Run the included MATLAB code to perform the locational probability processing with SWATHobj.
- Generate visual outputs (barcodes) and CFDs as part of the results.

## Outputs
- Plots: barcodes and CFDs.
- Processed locational probability data for along-valley analysis.

## Relevance to Environment Monitoring Analysts
- Follows standardized, established methods (TopoToolbox) for reproducible analysis.
- Produces outputs suitable for reporting environmental health along valley corridors and supports integration into monitoring workflows.
