# 01_GEE_Code

## Overview
- JavaScript code intended to export binary images for the Abulug active river channel at 2-year intervals using Google Earth Engine (GEE).

## Files and changes
- GEE_Code_Abulug_Deprecated.txt: Original code that used Landsat Collection 1 (now deprecated).
- GEE_Code_Abulug_Migrated.txt: Modified code migrated to Landsat Collection 2.

## Data source and migration
- Indicates a transition from Landsat Collection 1 to Landsat Collection 2 to maintain compatibility with current data standards and avoid using deprecated data.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Emphasizes the need to keep data processing code up-to-date with data source changes to ensure reproducibility of environmental health measures.
- Highlights importance of documenting data provenance and versioning (which Landsat collection is used) in monitoring outputs.
- Underlines maintenance requirements when data sources are deprecated, including updating code and possibly reprocessing historical outputs.
