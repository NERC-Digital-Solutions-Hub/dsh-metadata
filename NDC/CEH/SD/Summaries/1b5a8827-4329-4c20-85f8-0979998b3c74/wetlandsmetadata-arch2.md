# Wetland life project, species table for larval and adult mosquitos at various wetland sites, samples from April to October 2017 and 2018

## Aim and scope
- Use standardized, time-series data to demonstrate environmental health and mosquito biodiversity/abundance across wetlands.
- Provide evidence to inform wetland suitability and policy-relevant monitoring over time.
- Ensure data are verifiable, quality assured, and suitable for integration with other datasets.

## Study design and sampling methods
- 12 wetland sites in the UK sampled.
- Adult mosquitoes: two Mosquito Magnet traps per site, operated continuously for four days and four nights, fortnightly from early April to late October.
  - Traps mimic host animals; use propane combustion (CO2) and heat, with octenol lure.
- Larval sampling: one survey per target water body in May, July, and September.
  - Collect ~1 L surface water per site by taking ~200 mL with a standard white container (immersed five times).
  - Collect mosquito larvae with a pipette; store larval samples in 75% ethanol.
- Sampling dates span April 2017 to September 2018; average ~9 samples per site.

## Data types and structure
- Data are total counts by life stage (larvae, adults) and mosquito species, broken down by site and year/month.
- CSV data file structure:
  - Columns for date year, site, site latitude/longitude (degrees, minutes, seconds).
  - Followed by a species table with a column for every species found in the study.

## Quality control and limitations
- Species identified using published keys; secondary verification within the team.
- Methods adjusted to site topography; effort not guaranteed to be fully consistent across sites/time.
- Absolute population densities are approximate; counts provide relative measures of species distribution and abundance.

## Data management and accessibility
- Data verified, cleaned, and transformed; datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.
- Outputs from the data include clear formats suitable for reporting and visualization (e.g., maps and charts).
