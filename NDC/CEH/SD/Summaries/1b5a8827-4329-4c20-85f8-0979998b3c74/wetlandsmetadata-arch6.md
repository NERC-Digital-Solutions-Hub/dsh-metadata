# Wetland life project, species table for larval and adult mosquitos at various wetland sites, samples from April to October 2017 and 2018

- 12 wetland sites in the UK were sampled to monitor mosquito diversity and abundance.
- Average of 9 samples per site; sampling dates span April 2017 to September 2018.

## Study design and sampling methods

- Larval sampling
  - Conducted once in May, July, and September across different aquatic habitats at each site.
  - At each target water body, 1 L of surface water was sampled (approximately 200 ml collected into a white container, five sub-samples).
  - Only mosquito larvae collected using a pipette; samples stored in 75% ethanol.
- Adult sampling
  - Two Mosquito Magnet traps deployed per site, operating continuously for four days and four nights, fortnightly from early April to late October.
  - Traps attract mosquitoes by mimicking host cues; propane combustion releases CO2 and heat; lure includes octenol.
- Average sampling effort
  - ~9 samples per site across the study period.

## Data captured and format

- Nature and units: total counts by life stage (larvae or adults), species, site, and year/month.
- Data structure: CSV file with
  - Columns for date year, site, site latitude and longitude (in degrees, minutes, seconds format to preserve compatibility with Excel),
  - Followed by a species table with a column for every species found in the study.

## Data quality and considerations

- Species identification: conducted using published keys with secondary verification within the team.
- Method adjustments: sampling methods were adapted to suit site topography.
- Limitations: data reflect relative species distribution and sampling flexibility; there is no guarantee of completely consistent sampling effort, and estimates of absolute population density are approximate.

## Data usage and potential products

- Outputs support understanding species distribution across wetlands and can feed into self-serve data explorations (e.g., dashboards or pivot analyses) and inform decision-making about wetland mosquito presence.
- Related outputs and products include a wetland mosquito survey handbook and a broader set of project outputs.
