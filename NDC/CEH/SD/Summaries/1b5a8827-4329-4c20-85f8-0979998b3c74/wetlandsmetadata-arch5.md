# Wetland life project, species table for larval and adult mosquitos at various wetland sites, samples from April to October 2017 and 2018.

## Overview
- 12 UK wetland sites sampled to study mosquito diversity and abundance, with larval and adult data.
- Sampling period: April 2017 to September 2018 (adult sampling extended to October in some years).
- Average of ~9 samples per site.
- Data captured as total counts by life stage, species, site, and year/month.

## Study design and collection methods
- Larval sampling
  - Conducted once per target water body in May, July, and September.
  - Each sample: 1 L surface water; ~200 mL collected into a standard white container (immersed five times).
  - Mosquito larvae collected with a pipette; preserved in 75% ethanol.
- Adult sampling
  - Two Mosquito Magnet traps per site, operated continuously for four days and four nights, fortnightly from early April to late October.
  - Traps attract hosts via CO2 and heat; octenol odor supplement used.
  - Sampling aimed to detect species that may be missed in larval surveys and to assess relative adult abundance.

## Data recorded
- Data are total counts by life stage (larva/adult), mosquito species, site, and year/month.

## Data structure and units
- CSV format with:
  - Columns for date year, site, site latitude and longitude (D, m, s format with separators to preserve proper reading in Excel).
  - A subsequent species table with a column for every species found across the study.
- Data organization supports cross-site comparisons and downstream analyses.

## Quality control and limitations
- Species identification guided by published keys; secondary verification within the research team.
- Sampling methods adjusted to site topography; results show relative species distribution rather than exact, comparable sampling effort across all sites.
- No guarantee of totally consistent sampling effort; estimates of absolute population density are approximate.

## Data governance, provenance, and documentation
- Contains methodological detail (sampling dates, trap types, preservation method) and geographic coordinates to enable reproducibility and provenance tracking.
- Publications related to the study provide context and usage examples (see Publications).

## Data stewardship implications and recommended actions
- Ensure metadata completeness: document exact sampling effort per site, dates, and any deviations from protocol.
- Maintain data quality: continue validation of species identifications and track any re-identifications or corrections.
- Harmonize metadata for interoperability: align coordinate formats and unit conventions for future integrations.
- Facilitate discoverability and updates: publish dataset metadata and link to related publications; plan for versioning as new data or analyses are produced.
- Consider data access and licensing: clarify rights and usage terms to enable sharing with researchers and modelers.
