# Wetland life project, species table for larval and adult mosquitos at various wetland sites, samples from April to October 2017 and 2018.

## Overview
- A multi-site study across 12 UK wetlands collecting larval and adult mosquito data to inform a wetland suitability prediction tool.
- Combines larval surveys and adult trap data to capture species distribution and relative abundances over time.

## Study design and data collection
- Study sites: 12 wetland locations in the UK.
- Adult sampling: Two Mosquito Magnet traps deployed at each site, operated continuously for four days and nights every fortnight from early April to late October.
  - Traps attract mosquitoes by mimicking host cues using propane-generated CO2 and heat, plus octenol lure.
- Larval sampling: Conducted once per targeted water body in May, July, and September.
  - Sampled 1 L of surface water; collected ~200 mL into a standard container, then preserved in 75% ethanol.
- Purpose: Detect species missed by larval surveys and assess relative abundance of adult populations.

## Data captured and units
- Data are total counts by life stage (larvae and adults) and by species, site, and year/month.
- Each record includes site coordinates (latitude and longitude) and date information to support spatial-temporal analyses.
- Data structure designed to support cross-site comparisons and time-series analyses.

## Sampling schedule and coverage
- For each of the 12 sites, average of about 9 samples collected.
- Sampling window spans April 2017 to September 2018, with larval surveys in May, July, September and adult traps from April to October (fortnightly cadence).

## Data structure and accessibility
- Data provided as a CSV file with:
  - Columns for date/year, site, site latitude/longitude (degrees, minutes, seconds for Excel compatibility).
  - A species table with a column for every species observed across the study.

## Quality control and limitations
- Species identifications performed using published keys; secondary verification within the research team.
- Sampling methods adjusted to site topography; data reflect relative species distributions rather than guaranteed uniform effort.
- Absolute population density estimates are approximate due to potential inconsistencies in sampling effort and methodology.

## Potential analyses and uses
- Enables analyses of correlations between larval and adult mosquito abundance across sites and time.
- Supports modeling for predicting wetland suitability for different mosquito species.
- Data can feed into predictive tools and comparative studies of wetland ecosystems and mosquito communities.
