# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee; it relies on volunteers and thanks them for data contributions.
- It provides annual population status data for butterflies across the UK from 1976 to present, with data from over 2,500 active sites each year.
- The scheme uses a multi-component sampling framework:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m wide, ~26 counts per year, across ~2,000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–4 visits per year across ~750 squares.
- Outputs are used to understand changes in butterfly populations and inform biodiversity policy questions.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- Data are compiled into abundance indices, which are relative measures of population size rather than absolute counts.
- Indices are created by combining site-level indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method, with a weighting that reflects the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed each year at each site.
- The method uses all counts in a season (from all components) to model the seasonal pattern and extrapolate gaps, with greater emphasis on observed data.
- Results are designed to support robust trend analysis for each species across the UK.

## Quality control

- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Automatic checks identify potential data entry errors; regional coordinators review records for questionable entries throughout the season.
- Data undergo automated and manual validation to flag:
  - records outside known distribution ranges or flight periods,
  - records at new sites,
  - extreme or atypical abundances.
- Corrections are made through queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders before finalizing the UKBMS dataset.

## Details of this data download

- The download provides long- and short-term trends in collated indices for all species with sufficient data, delivered as a CSV file.
- Key columns include:
  - COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS
