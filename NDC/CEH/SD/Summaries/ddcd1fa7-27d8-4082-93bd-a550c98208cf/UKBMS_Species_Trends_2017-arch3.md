# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview and governance
- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Volunteers contribute data; the scheme relies on a large network of observers across the UK.
- It provides annual data on butterfly population status to inform policy questions related to biodiversity status and trends.

## Monitoring framework and data collection
- Data are collected via a wide-scale, site-based monitoring program plus sampling in randomly selected 1 km squares.
- Components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km) recorded weekly from April to September; about 26 counts per site per year; ~2000 sites sampled annually.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (timed counts, egg and larval web counts) focusing on specific species or methods.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): transect method applied to stratified-random 1 km squares; 2–4 visits per square per year (minimum 2 visits in July/August); ~750 squares sampled annually.
- The UKBMS dataset combines results from all components to monitor butterfly abundance across the UK since 1976 (over 2500 active sites yearly).

## Data processing and trend analysis
- Data are converted into abundance indices (relative measures of population size, not absolute counts).
- Index construction uses the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with a site- and year-weighting scheme that emphasizes observed data and accounts for sampling gaps.
- All counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS are used to estimate seasonal counts and produce species-level collated indices.

## Quality control and data management
- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker before uploading to a central database.
- Automated checks identify potential data entry errors; regional transect coordinators validate records and perform ongoing checks during the season.
- Additional automated/manual validation queries cover: records outside species’ known distribution, outside flight periods, first-time site records, extreme or unusual counts.
- Corrections are made through queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders to update the main UKBMS dataset.

## Data download and structure
- The downloadable data provide long- and short-term trends in collated indices for species with sufficient data, exported as CSV.
- Columns include:
  - COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME
  - NYEARS (years in the series)
  - F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDETAIL, F_FULL_R (overall trend and description)
  - T20_LIN_B, T20_LIN_SE, T20_LIN_P, T20_TRENDDETAIL, T20_20_R (last 20-year trend metrics)
  - T10_LIN_B, T10_LIN_SE, T10_LIN_P, T10_TRENDDETAIL, T10_10_R (last 10-year trend metrics)
