## Data management, provenance, and governance

- Provenance and labeling:
  - Each horizon and soil sample is tracked by MLURI barcodes (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, etc.) and horizon designations, enabling traceability from field to lab data.
  - Auger samples and vegetation plots are annotated at multiple levels (plot, subplot, horizon) for granular data lineage.
- Storage and archival:
  - Immediate analyses conducted in field/lab; archival samples stored for long-term access.
  - Data and metadata embedded in structured formats with appendices and supporting datasets referenced (e.g., Twinspan, Association analyses).
- Accessibility and reuse:
  - Data are prepared for long-term ecological research and cross-site comparisons (ECN/Micronet context).
  - Documentation supports reproducibility, auditing, and re-analysis, with explicit block/plot/treatment mappings and sampling dates.

## Key takeaways for data stewards

- Metadata completeness:
  - Capture precise location (grid refs, altitude), slope, drainage, soil series, parent material, and site history alongside sampling dates.
- Standardization of data structures:
  - Use consistent units and formats across blocks (%N, %C, C:N, pH H2O, pH CaCl2, exchangeable cations) and unambiguous horizon labels and MLURI barcodes.
- Explicit experimental/document design:
  - Document horizon-level lab methods, subplot layouts, and any treatments or Ecotron allocations to support reproducibility and cross-study integration.
- Provenance and archival practices:
  - Preserve horizon- and plot-level data in raw and processed forms; maintain a clear audit trail of data processing steps (e.g., QC checks, data transformations).
- Data sharing and reuse readiness:
  - Align datasets with companion materials (appendices, species lists, soil profiles) to enable external analyses; provide clear metadata and cross-references to supporting documents and datasets.
