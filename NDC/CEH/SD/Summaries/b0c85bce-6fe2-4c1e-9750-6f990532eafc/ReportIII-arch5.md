# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide context for detailed studies with a broad monitoring program; baseline data described in 1998.
- 1999–2001 saw data collection across weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, with attention to year-to-year comparisons and site heterogeneity.

## Data collected and methods

- Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 headline measures: rainfall near long-term average, radiation stable, slightly cooler temperatures, higher soil moisture vs. prior year.
  - Data collected on-site and regularly downloaded; transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
  - Variables tracked include rainfall, radiation, soil moisture, and multi-depth air/soil temperatures (0–20 cm).

- Above-ground biomass
  - Biomass assessed on five mowing occasions per summer (May–Sept) using random 0.5 m² cells within sub-plots.
  - Vegetation clipped, dried (80°C), and weighed; total annual biomass calculated; values ln-transformed for ANOVA.
  - Normalisation: biomass figures expressed relative to the C1 (control) plot to compare year-to-year treatment effects.
  - Findings: nitrogen and/or lime inputs increased biomass; nitrogen+lime combination most effective; 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.

- Soil pH
  - Measured in the upper 5 cm; lime addition raised pH (October 2001: lime plots 6.19, N+L plots 6.38); nitrogen alone also raised pH but less so.
  - Control plots showed no significant pH change since August 1998 baseline.

- Botanical composition
  - Point Quadrat survey in July 2001 (mirroring July 2000 protocol); two surveyors each responsible for ~50% of quadrats; no significant inter-surveyor difference.
  - Findings: 58% more total hits in 2001 vs 2000 across all treatments, suggesting denser sward (possible grazing removal in 1998).
  - Treatment effects: shift in species composition with improved plots (N and/or L) showing higher abundance of Festuca spp., Poa pratensis, and other species typical of improved pastures; unimproved plots retained species linked to poorer fertility (Agrostis capillaris, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
  - Diversity: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime plots, indicating potential diversity decline with strong fertility/liming.
  - Multivariate analysis: PCA separated nitrogen/limed plots from control/biocide plots; biomass-associated changes tracked via correlations between major species hits and biomass; increased litter in N and/or lime plots linked to faster vegetation turnover.

## Data collection timeline and management context

- Table 1: Data collection schedule across 1998–2001 (data on main Soil Biodiversity field experiment; includes soil sampling, measurements, and management activities).
- Field management in 2001:
  - Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions: no visitors Feb–May 2001; protocol-based access resumed with vet oversight.
  - Officer in Charge changed in May 2001.
  - Management activities largely maintained post-FMD (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, Point Analysis); first biocide application in May 2001 was missed, subsequent applications completed.

## Site heterogeneity and data considerations

- Spatial heterogeneity observed
  - Columns E and F tended to be more acidic; potential underlying heterogeneity across the site, with lower pH in N and/or Lime plots in those columns.
- Biomass variation
  - Higher biomass generally in centrally located plots; outliers with lower biomass identified across all treatments.
  - Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.

## Data governance implications for Data Stewards

- Provenance and consistency
  - Clear documentation of data collection protocols (mowing methods, quadrat technique, soil sampling depth, pH measurement, weather station data handling).
  - Inter-surveyor consistency tested and reported as not significantly different, supporting data reliability across samplings.
- Temporal and contextual factors
  - Year-to-year comparability achieved via normalisation to C1; explicit acknowledgement of changes in personnel and equipment (mechanical shears) affecting biomass measurements.
  - External disruptions (FMD) and administrative changes (officer in charge) documented, with protocol-based access to continue data collection.
- Data quality and analysis notes
  - Use of transformations (ln) for biomass, ANOVA results indicating treatment, year, and interaction effects; PCA used to explore community composition shifts.
  - Detailed treatment effects on species composition and biomass linked to fertility management (N and/or Lime) and their ecological implications.
- Metadata and sharing considerations
  - Data types (weather, biomass, soil pH, botanical surveys) with measurement schedules, locations (plots/sub-plots), and treatment codes clearly defined.
  - Site heterogeneity and management events should be captured in metadata to enable accurate interpretation and replication.
  - Acknowledgments indicate data stewardship and data management support; appendices and tables provide raw data structure and results for integration into broader datasets.
