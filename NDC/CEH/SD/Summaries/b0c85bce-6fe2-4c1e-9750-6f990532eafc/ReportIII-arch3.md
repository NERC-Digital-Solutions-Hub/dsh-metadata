# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Aim and Context
- Large field experiment as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, aimed at providing a broad monitoring context for diverse studies.
- Location: Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders; ongoing management and sampling described in Baseline Data Survey (1998).
- Monitoring designed to enable cross-study linkages and year-to-year comparisons; facilitates data interpretation and comparisons across datasets.

## Monitoring Measures and Methods

- Variables monitored
  - Weather: Automatic Weather Station data (rainfall, radiation, air and soil temperatures, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground biomass: five summer harvests per year (May–Sept), 0.5 m2 subplots, drying and weighing, biomass totals per plot.
  - Soil chemistry: surface soil pH (top 5 cm).
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys in July 2001 (grid-based hits for plant species).
- Experimental design and treatments
  - Treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen + Lime (N&L), Biocide.
  - Sampling and measurement periods span 1998–2001, with 2001 events impacted by external factors.
- Data handling and analysis
  - Data processed with transformations (e.g., log-transformed biomass), ANOVA (split-plot) to test treatment effects, and cross-year analyses.
  - Multivariate analysis (PCA) used to explore shifts in vegetation composition relative to treatments.
- Protocol and governance notes
  - Field surveys used standardized methods (e.g., fixed mowing schedule, fixed sub-plots, and Point Quadrat methodology) to enable year-to-year comparability.
  - Data management included routine weather data transmission and clear documentation of measurement dates.

## Key Results

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 weather: near-average rainfall (following very wet prior year); radiation similar to long-term average; cooler average temperatures; higher soil moisture than in some previous years.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Biomass showed a consistent treatment hierarchy; peak production in July/Aug.
  - 2001 biomass markedly higher than earlier years, likely due to staff changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - When normalised to the control C1, nitrogen and lime treatments showed the strongest positive effects on productivity.
  - ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Lime addition continued to raise surface pH (October 2001: ~6.19 in limed plots; ~6.38 in N&L plots).
  - Nitrogen addition also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed little change since baseline (August 1998).

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - July 2001 hits were 58% higher than July 2000, indicating denser sward, possibly from grazing removal in 1998.
  - Distinct species patterns by treatment:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments.
    - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and fewer less-fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
  - Diversity: unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) contained 24 species; Nitrogen & Lime plots had only 18, suggesting a potential decline in diversity with the most fertilised/improved plots.
  - Multivariate PCA largely separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; controls tended toward species like Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Biomass correlations: higher biomass associated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while other species (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes) declined as biomass increased.
  - Increased litter frequency in N and/or L plots suggested faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F tended to be more acidic; pH variation linked with plot treatments in some columns (notably lower pH in N and/or Lime plots in those areas).

- 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
  - Outlying plots (lower biomass) occurred across all treatments; higher biomass tended to cluster in more central site locations.
  - Positive correlation observed between surface soil pH and biomass.

## Data Management and Observations

- Data sources and consistency
  - Weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical data collected using standardized protocols to enable cross-year comparisons and integration with other studies.
- Management and external events
  - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions in 2001 temporarily limited access and required protocol-driven access; Management changes (Officer in Charge) occurred mid-year.
- Data interpretation
  - Across three years, nitrogen and lime inputs were effective in increasing biomass and soil pH, while plant community composition shifted toward species associated with improved pastures in fertilised plots.
  - Site heterogeneity highlighted the importance of spatial structure when interpreting treatment effects.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- Demonstrates the value of integrating multiple, standardized monitoring components (weather, productivity, soil chemistry, and plant community composition) to assess ecosystem responses to management practices.
- Highlights the need for:
  - Baseline data and year-to-year comparability to detect treatment effects.
  - Clear documentation of measurement protocols and data processing (e.g., data transformations, ANOVA, PCA) to enable cross-study synthesis.
  - Attention to site heterogeneity and spatial structure in analysis and interpretation.
  - Robust data governance considerations, including data sharing and metadata (especially when external events or personnel changes affect data collection).
