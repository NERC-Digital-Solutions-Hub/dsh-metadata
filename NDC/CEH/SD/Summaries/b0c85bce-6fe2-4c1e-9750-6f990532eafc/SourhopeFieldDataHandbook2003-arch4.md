## Data governance, storage and access considerations for Data Leaders

- Metadata and data linkage
  - Maintain explicit metadata linking blocks, horizons, plots/subplots, and horizon designations (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) across all blocks and with ECOTRON data.
  - Preserve provenance: sample IDs, horizon delineations, and archiving details (e.g., barcodes such as MLURI 603930, 603930-series for BLOCK 4; 603957–603963 for BLOCK 5; ECOTRON IDs).
- Data model and integration
  - Consolidate horizon-level chemical data (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2) with horizon depth and descriptive metadata into an integrated data model to support cross-block comparisons and long-term analyses.
  - Include plot-level and subplot-level vegetation metrics alongside soil properties to facilitate soil–vegetation interaction studies.
- Data quality controls
  - Document sampling limitations (e.g., subset of subplots in establishment years; occasional missing values for certain elements like Na in some horizons).
  - Flag anomalous blocks/plots and provide notes on measurement methods and lab QA/QC (e.g., laboratory methods for N, C, LOI, pH).
  - Ensure consistent coding for horizons, blocks, plots, and auger sample identifiers; maintain versioning as datasets evolve with ongoing sampling.
- Accessibility and reuse
  - Align data publication and sharing with project-wide norms (ECN Micronet data sharing); provide clear data dictionaries and repository deposition details.
  - Include horizon maps, grid coordinates, and sampling maps to improve discoverability and cross-site synthesis.
- Stewardship and governance
  - Designate data custodians for blocks, plots, horizons, and auger data; implement change control and data lineage tracking to support reproducibility and data-driven decision making.

## Key takeaways for Data Leaders

- The Sourhope dataset provides a comprehensive, horizon-resolved view of soil chemistry and physical properties (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH) across multiple horizons and blocks, coupled with detailed vegetation surveys and archival storage.
- The multi-block design (Blocks 4 and 5) and inclusion of ECOTRON data illustrate how to structure complex field experiments with treatments, replication, and cross-site comparability (ECN Micronet context).
- Horizon-level data, provenance, and archiving practices showcased here demonstrate essential data governance needs: clear metadata, consistent labeling, traceable sample IDs, integrated data models, data quality documentation, and accessible repositories.
- For data strategy and stewardship, ensure robust metadata linking, horizon-specific lab methods documentation, and easy discoverability to enable effective data sharing, reuse, and long-term ecological analyses.
