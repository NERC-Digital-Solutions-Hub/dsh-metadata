# SOIL ANALYSIS OF RIGG FOOT, SOURHOPE : BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of the Sourhope long-term environmental monitoring program focusing on soil chemistry, moisture characteristics, and associated vegetation data at Rigg Foot.
  - Block 4 auger samples (4A–4F) analyzed for basic soil chemistry, carbon/nitrogen content, moisture/aerosol loss indicators, and pH (H2O and CaCl2).

- Block 4 auger sample results (4A–4F)
  - Weight of samples: 4A (6.012 mg) to 4F (5.674 mg).
  - Nitrogen (%N): 0.51–0.58% (4D is 0.51%; others 0.53–0.58%).
  - Carbon (%C): 6.80–8.02% (lowest 4E 6.80%; highest 4A 8.02%).
  - C:N ratio: 12.62–14.26 (range reflects %N and %C balance).
  - Calcium (Ca meq/100 g): 1.01–2.96 (highest in 4A; lowest in 4C).
  - Sodium (Na meq/100 g): 0.12–0.15 (consistent across samples).
  - Potassium (K meq/100 g): 0.58–0.81 (4F highest at 0.81).
  - Magnesium (Mg meq/100 g): 0.58–1.59 (4A highest 1.59; 4E lowest 0.58).
  - Moisture loss: 4.29–5.15%.
  - Loss on ignition (LOI): 14.60–17.96%.
  - pH (H2O): 4.45–4.82.
  - pH (CaCl2): 3.64–4.05.
  - Overall pattern: slightly acidic to near-neutral soil with relatively consistent N and C values; higher LOI and moisture in some samples indicate organic-rich upper horizons.

- Vegetation survey (Block 4)
  - Subplots 4A–4F include species presence/absence tallies and totals for each plot, reflecting microhabitat variation and vegetation structure within Block 4.
  - Data indicate variable species composition across subplots, contributing to understanding of soil-vegetation linkages at this site.

- Soil profile and horizon context (Block 4–related data)
  - Block 5 data (see Block 5 section below) provide horizon-level context for Ah/ABg/Bg BCg/Cg layers with detailed N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, moisture loss, LOI, and pH values.
  - Block 4 auger samples sit within this broader horizon framework used for long-term monitoring and comparison across blocks.

- Data handling notes
  - Samples are catalogued with MLURI barcodes for traceability.
  - Data are intended for long-term storage and integration with other Sourhope data portals and datasets to support monitoring and policy-relevant analyses.

- Enduring relevance
  - Provides baseline soil chemical and physical properties at Rigg Foot for Block 4, enabling temporal trend analyses when combined with Blocks 5 and ECOTRON data.
  - Supports linking vegetation composition to soil chemistry and climate context within the Sourhope hill grazing ecosystem.

## Block 5: Soil and Vegetation Data (Overview)

- Site context
  - Block 5, Sourhope: grid NT8544019520, about 315 m altitude, slope ~5°, imperfect drainage.
  - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material includes intermediate igneous/andesite.
  - Profile: FH, H, Ah, ABg, Bg, BCg, Cg horizons described with depth intervals and horizon-scale characteristics.

- Soil profile observations (Block 5)
  - Horizons: FH (0–1 cm), H (1–5 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Key chemistry and physicals across horizons:
    - %N: from 0.04–2.17%, higher in surface Ah/H layers (Ah ~0.65%, FH ~2.05–2.17%).
    - %C: high in surface horizons (FH ~33–34%), reducing with depth (Ah ~9.36%, Cg ~0.12%).
    - C:N ratios: surface horizons ~16–14, deeper horizons ~10–11.
    - Calcium (Ca meq/100 g): variable, higher in younger horizons (Ah ~2.38), lower in AB/Bg layers.
    - Magnesium (Mg meq/100 g): elevated in several horizons, particularly Ah and Bg (~1.5–5.9 in some layers).
    - pH: surface H2O around 4.4–4.9; CaCl2 values around 3.8–4.5 depending on horizon.
    - Moisture loss and LOI: surface horizons show higher LOI values (e.g., FH LOI ~67.0% in Block 5 horizon data), with moisture loss around 8–9% in FH/H.
  - Depth-specific horizon data indicate clear horizon differentiation and substantial organic content in Ah, with progressive clay accumulation in lower horizons.

- Block 5 auger samples (5A–5F)
  - N: 0.53–0.62%; C: 7.01–9.07%; C:N: 12.94–14.74.
  - Ca: 2.58–5.07 meq/100 g; Na: ~0.14–0.17; K: 0.59–0.83; Mg: 1.51–2.89 meq/100 g.
  - %Moisture loss: ~4.60–5.19%; LOI: ~15.99–20.10%.
  - pH H2O: 4.70–4.95; pH CaCl2: 3.53–4.14.
  - Indicates substantial organic matter in surface horizons with moderate to high base cation content in the upper layers, decreasing with depth and varying by sub-horizon.

- Block 5 vegetation data
  - Vegetation surveys (5A–5F) recorded for subplots with totals per subplot, illustrating species distribution across the block.
  - Data demonstrate heterogeneous vegetation patterns consistent with the soil horizon variation and microhabitat differences.

- ECOTRON soil site
  - ECOTRON PLOT: soil analysis shows N 0.59%, C 8.22%, C:N 13.83, Ca 2.76, Mg 1.7, K 0.62, Na 0.15; moisture loss 4.79%; LOI 17.42%; pH H2O 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82.

- Data handling context
  - Data entries include multiple MLURI barcodes for traceability and facilitate archiving and cross-dataset integration.
  - The Block 5 data complement Block 4 auger results to form a cohesive, horizon-resolved dataset for the Sourhope site.

- Enduring relevance
