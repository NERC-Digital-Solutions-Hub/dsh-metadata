# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

## Overview
- Compiled soil profiles, chemical and physical analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys for Sourhope field site, focusing on Rigg Foot Block 4 and Block 5, including Ecotron subplot data.
- Documents horizon sequences, lab measurements, and vegetation composition to support analyses of soil–vegetation interactions under different treatments and micro-sites.

## Data Structure and Contents

- Block 4
  - Soil Profile (depths and horizons): LF (0–1 cm); FH (1–4 cm); H (4–8 cm); Ah (8–29 cm); Abg (29–40 cm); B sg (40–61 cm); C gx (61–95 cm) with detailed descriptive notes for each horizon (color, texture, structure, roots, stones).
  - Soil Analysis by Horizon: measurements across FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx including weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition; pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2); with sub-samples 4A–4F for auger data.
  - Auger Samples (4A–4F): replicated chemical measurements (%N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH) across six auger points per block.
  - Vegetation Survey (Block 4): plot-level species presence and counts (e.g., Plot 4A–4F) with totals per subplot, per plot, and per species; indicates community composition by subplots.

- Block 5
  - Site Details: Grid reference NT8544019520; altitude 315 m; slope 5°; imperfect drainage; major soil subgroup Brown forest soil with gleying; parent igneous/andesite materials.
  - Soil Profile (0–100 cm): Horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with descriptive notes on color, texture, structure, roots, stones, mottling, boundary between horizons.
  - Soil Analysis by Horizon: horizon-level metrics (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %LOI; pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2); with horizon-specific values.
  - Auger Samples (5A–5F): identical suite of measurements for six auger points per block (5A–5F), including %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH, and related weights.
  - Vegetation Survey (Block 5): plot-level species tallies (e.g., Plots 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F) with per-plot totals and presence/absence of taxa; detailed species lists and totals by subplot.

- Ecotron Plot Data
  - Soil Analysis: weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %LOI; pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2) for Ecotron plots.
  - Vegetation Survey: subplot-level counts and species occurrences; summarizes community composition under controlled conditions.

## Key Variables and Measurements

- Horizons and depths: LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, C x (Block 4 and Block 5 with horizon distinctions).
- Chemical properties: %N, %C, C:N ratio; Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g).
- Physical properties: %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI); soil moisture context.
- pH metrics: pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2).
- Vegetation data: per-plot species presence/abundance tallies; totals per block and per species; subplots within plots.
- Data granularity: horizon-level (per horizon per block) and sub-sample level (auger points 4A–4F, 5A–5F) across blocks 4 and 5; Ecotron subplots.

## Data Quality, Coverage, and Limitations

- Coverage limitations: Vegetation data cover only a subset of subplots per block; extrapolations to entire blocks should be cautious.
- Representativeness: Profiles and auger data provide baseline, horizon-specific snapshots rather than complete coverage across all blocks; some horizons show limited or missing values in certain measurements.
- Data Integration: Cross-links soil chemistry with vegetation composition enabling multi-domain analyses; data archived with block-, horizon-, and subplot-level granularity.
- Outputs and References: Analyses and outputs include horizon-level tables and appendices (e.g., horizon data tables, auger tables, vegetation tallies) and references to broader datasets (e.g., ECN/Sourhope datasets, Institutional archives).
