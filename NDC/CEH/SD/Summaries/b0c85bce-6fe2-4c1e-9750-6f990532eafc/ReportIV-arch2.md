# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity at the Sourhope field site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders).
  - Site structure: 5 replicate blocks on downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; research groups operate in 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells.

- Site management and treatments
  - Site-wide mowing: monthly from May to September to ~6 cm.
  - Insecticide treatment (Dursban 4): applied to designated plots after mowing.
  - Fertility treatments: nitrogen and/or lime applied to specified plots each spring.
  - Treatment groups (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (formerly Biocide).
  - Planned vs. actual management context: grazing removed in 1998; mechanical cutting and fertilization continued; various years show dates and rates of applications (see Appendix 2 for details).

- Data collection and monitoring methods
  - Weather: continuous data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (rainfall, temperature, radiation, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground productivity: annual biomass estimates from 0.5 m2 samples per sub-plot, clipped prior to each mow, dried, and weighed.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline (1998) and annual point analysis surveys (2000–2002) using a 0.5 m2 cell with a 100-point grid; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
  - Soil measurements: soil pH (0–5 cm), soil moisture (theta probe in point analysis cells); additional soil sampling since 1998 totaling 11,621 samples to date.
  - Additional small-scale botanical surveys and biomass sampling across years (Appendices 2–7).
  - Data analysis: split-plot ANOVA, PCA, LSD post-hoc tests; Shannon diversity indices computed across baseline (1998) and subsequent years.

- Key results and trends (2002 data in context of 1999–2002)
  - Biomass productivity
    - Overall, biomass increased across treatments from 1999 to 2002, showing a long-term upward trend.
    - 2002 saw a decline in biomass relative to 2001 across many treatments; the Nitrogen + Lime (N&L) plots continued to exhibit the strongest productivity.
    - Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1 and the fertilized plots.
    - A slope/location effect: productivity generally decreased from bottom-block locations toward upper blocks; Block 1 showed large year-to-year declines, reflecting spatial heterogeneity.
  - Fertilization and soil chemistry
    - Lime and/or nitrogen markedly increased productivity, with the strongest response where both were applied.
    - Lime raised soil pH to about 7.0 in the upper soil profile for limed plots; nitrogen had smaller but significant pH effects.
    - Higher soil pH generally correlated with higher productivity, though the strength of this relationship varied by treatment; in plots with both nitrogen and lime, the positive pH–productivity relationship was less clear or negative.
    - A negative correlation between soil moisture and pH was observed; drier, higher-pH plots tended to have higher productivity in some treatments.
  - Plant community composition and diversity
    - Mowing effects: Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis declined by more than 40% since 2000, across most treatments, suggesting mowing (and corresponding sward homogenization) as a key driver.
    - Festuca rubra expanded notably in more fertile plots, especially where lime and/or nitrogen were applied.
    - Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) increased across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; regular mowing plus absence of grazing likely facilitated bryophyte expansion.
    - Insecticide plots showed higher bryophyte presence in some years; overall, the insecticide effect on diversity remains uncertain but may relate to reduced herbivory allowing more palatable species to persist.
    - Species composition shifts: frequent changes in the relative abundance of Festuca spp., Agrostis spp., and other grasses; unimproved plots favored stress-tolerant species, fertilized plots favored competitive, disturbance-sensitive groups.
  - Functional group dynamics (CSR framework)
    - Plants classified into stress-tolerators (S), competitive (C), and ruderal (R) types, plus SR/CSR transitions.
    - By 2002, three functional groupings accounted for a large majority of hits (69–95% per plot).
    - Fertilized plots (notably N&L) saw expansion of C-S-R species, leveraging higher pH and nutrient availability.
    - Stress-tolerators dominated in unimproved plots; SR/CSR groups declined with increased disturbance from mowing and nutrient enrichment.
  - Insecticide and trampling effects
    - Insecticide (Dursban) may influence plant diversity by altering herbivory, but direct causation to diversity metrics is not conclusively established.
    - Trampling effects were notable in the newly surveyed C2 plots in 2002, likely due to intense activity linked to 13CO2 pulse experiments, leading to reduced productivity locally.
  - Diversity metrics
    - Shannon diversity indices declined in the N&L plots by 2002 relative to other treatments; other treatments saw modest increases.
    - Point analysis revealed shifts in the relative representation of common pasture-associated grasses (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) in fertilized plots, versus dominance of unimproved-associated species (Agrostis spp., Festuca ovina) in unimproved plots.
    - Bryophyte hits rose over time, contributing to overall increases in non-vascular plant representation, particularly in unimproved plots.

- Implications for monitoring, data value, and environment-focused policy
  - Management trade-offs: fertilization increases productivity but can reduce plant diversity; mowing and removal of grazing appear to favor stress-tolerant and bryophytic components, altering ecosystem function.
  - Soil chemistry as a driver: liming moves pH toward neutrality/alkalinity, enhancing productivity in fertilized plots but potentially changing species balance; careful long-term monitoring needed to avoid nutrient imbalances.
  - Data standards and reuse: standardized measurements (biomass, species hits, PCA groupings, diversity indices) support cross-year comparisons and integration with other programme datasets; datasets are stored and shared via project portals.
  - Monitoring approach relevance: the combination of repeated biomass harvests, detailed point analyses, soil chemistry, and bryophyte assessments provides a robust framework for tracking environmental health, ecosystem function, and policy performance over time.

- Notable references and supplemental materials
  - CSR plant functional-type framework (Grime, 1979; Grime et al., 1996) used to interpret shifts in community strategies.
  - Appendix materials include detailed site maps, treatment summaries, species lists, weather data, biomass records, and PCA results to support reproducibility and ongoing monitoring.

- Bottom-line takeaway for environmental analytics
  - The Sourhope site demonstrates how standardised, longitudinal monitoring links management actions (mowing, fertilization, insecticide use) to measurable outcomes in productivity and biodiversity, mediated by soil chemistry and disturbance regime. The data reveal clear short-term responses (e.g., productivity peaks with N+L) and more nuanced long-term shifts in functional composition and diversity, underscoring the value of integrated, time-series analysis for informing land-use and biodiversity policy.
