## Block 4 vegetation survey: general patterns

- Plots 4A–4F show a mix of grasses and forbs with varying species totals per subplot.
- Notable trends suggest grassy-dominated upland grassland with localized mosses and forbs; edge vs interior micro-sites show some differentiation in composition.
- Overall, plant community composition aligns with the soil gradient, particularly the organic-rich, weathered surface horizons and the underlying mineral soil.

## Data management and scope

- The dataset integrates soil morphology, chemical/physical properties, auger and horizon-level analyses, and vegetation surveys across Block 4, Block 5, and Ecotron plots.
- Data are structured for long-term use with cross-block comparisons and potential portal-based metadata sharing to enhance discoverability and reuse.
- The combined data support analyses of soil-plant interactions under perturbations and natural gradients in upland grassland ecosystems, consistent with the broader Sourhope field data handbook aims.
