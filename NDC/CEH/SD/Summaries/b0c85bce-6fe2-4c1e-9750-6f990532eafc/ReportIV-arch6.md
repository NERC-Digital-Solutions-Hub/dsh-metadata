# SUMMARY

- Four-year NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, focusing on above-ground biomass (productivity), plant community composition, and diversity in a controlled field experiment.
- Central finding: three management processes—mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and insecticide application—drive major botanical changes, with additional effects from trampling and site disturbance.

## Data collection and sources

- On-site automatic weather station: ongoing weather data since February 1999.
- Above-ground productivity: regular clipping of 0.5 m^2 random cells per plot, dried and weighed (since 1999).
- Vegetation monitoring: baseline survey (1998) and annual point analysis surveys (2000, 2001, 2002) using a 0.5 m^2 cell and a 100-hole grid to record species touches.
- Soils: periodic soil pH (measured in water) at ~5 cm depth; soil moisture measured in 2002 with theta probes.
- Botanical surveys: small-scale cover estimates, biomass by plot, bryophyte and liverwort identification, and detailed species lists (Appendices and project outputs).
- Experimental design: 5 replicate blocks with 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots across treatments; 0.5 m^2 sampling cells arranged across sub-plots S, T, U, V for data collection.

## Data management and QA

- Large, integrated dataset across years (1998–2002): biomass by plot/year, point analysis hits by species, bryophyte records, litter, soil pH, soil moisture, and weather data.
- Cross-year analyses: ANOVA (split-plot), PCA, and Shannon diversity indices used to compare treatments and years.
- Data validation: two surveyors performed the 2002 point analysis with no significant difference in totals; Appendix data include species lists, SOC/Bryophyte identifications, and QA notes.
- Data gaps: 2002 weather data partially lost due to a station malfunction (approx. six weeks data missing; substitutions used from Konza station for missing periods).

## Data processing and analyses

- Biomass analysis: annual biomass by treatment; time-series across 1999–2002; normalization against Control 1 to show relative treatment effects; significant treatment-year interactions detected.
- Functional plant groups: CSR-based classification (stress tolerators, competitive-stress-ruderals, and their combinations) tracked across years to assess shifts in functional composition.
- Relationships with soil: examination of links between soil pH, moisture, and biomass; overall positive relationship between higher pH and productivity, with treatment-specific patterns (e.g., nitrogen+lime plots showing nuanced responses).
- Community composition: point-analysis PCA to distinguish improved vs. unimproved plots; bryophyte contributions tracked; litter dynamics analyzed via ANOVA.
- Diversity and structure: Shannon diversity indices calculated over time to assess changes in diversity across treatments; bryophyte proportion and species richness analyzed; shifts in dominant grasses (Festuca vs. Agrostis spp.) documented.

## Key data products and outputs

- Biomass time-series and treatment-normalized biomass figures (e.g., Figures 1–4; Tables and Appendices).
- Appendix datasets:
  - Appendix 1: site map with plot treatments.
  - Appendix 2: summary of site- and plot-level treatments.
  - Appendix 3: comprehensive species list (vascular plants and bryophytes).
  - Appendix 5: Automatic Weather Station headline data.
  - Appendix 6–9: biomass by plot, rank analyses, species abundance, and PCA loadings.
- Point-analysis outputs: frequency of species hits by treatment; proportion of monocots, dicots, and bryophytes; changes in functional group representation (S, CSR, SR/CSR) over time.
- Statistical outcomes: detailed ANOVA results (Table 1), PCA plots (Figure 5), diversity indices (Figure 8), and CSR group trends (Figure 9).

## Main findings by data category

- Mowing effect
  - Consistent decline in Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis since 2000; likely a site- or mowing-driven pattern rather than a single treatment effect.
  - Festuca rubra expands in more fertile (N or Lime) plots; mosses expand with mowing and reduced disturbance; stress-tolerant species rise across most plots.
- Fertilisation effect
  - Nitrogen and/or lime treatments increase above-ground productivity, with the N+L combination yielding the greatest productivity, though signs of saturation or stress (high pH, lower moisture) appear in some plots.
  - Soil pH rises toward ~7 in lime-treated plots; productivity correlates with pH in a non-linear, treatment-dependent way.
  - Potential chlorosis and moisture stress observed in high-pH plots during dry periods.
- Insecticide effect
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4) plots show higher plant diversity in the context of herbivore exclusion, but causality is cautious due to limited direct insect-herbivore data; observed patterns align with literature linking herbivory to shifts in diversity.
- Trampling effect
  - First-year data for C2 plots (newly surveyed) show reduced productivity likely due to trampling during peak sampling/labelled 13CO2 pulse activities.
- Community structure and functional groups
  - Shifts from SR/C-S-R and C-S-R to stress-tolerant groups in unimproved plots; nitrogen+lime plots show dominance by C-S-R types due to higher growth rates and soil conditions.
  - Bryophyte proportion increases across years, especially in unimproved plots, contributing to overall community structure changes.
- Spatial and environmental context
  - Slope position influences productivity, with lower blocks (upper slope) showing greater reductions in biomass in some years.
  - Soil moisture and pH demonstrate strong interdependence; lime dramatically increases pH, which interacts with moisture to modulate productivity.

## Data limitations and gaps

- 2002 weather data incomplete due to station malfunction; some data substituted from nearby station.
- Control 2 plots excluded from some early year surveys (2000–2001).
- Some bryophyte identifications refined in 2002 (species-level resolution improved).

## Implications for data support practice

- The study demonstrates the value of integrated, multi-source data (climate, soil, biomass, species presence, and functional classification) for understanding ecosystem responses to management.
- Data products that translate complex multi-year, multi-treatment data into actionable dashboards or self-serve analyses would support end users (policy-makers, land managers) in interpreting productivity and biodiversity responses.
- Regular data quality checks (cross-year validation, multi-t collector QA) and transparent handling of data gaps (notably weather station outages) are essential for credible long-term datasets.
- Opportunities exist to publish simplified summaries (treatment-by-year trajectories, functional-group shifts) and to make detailed appendices (species lists, PCA loadings, biomass per plot) accessible to researchers and practitioners.
