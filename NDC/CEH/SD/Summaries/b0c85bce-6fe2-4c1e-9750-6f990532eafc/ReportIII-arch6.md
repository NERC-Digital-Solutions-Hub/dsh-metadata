# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Location and scope: Large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; aims to provide context for broader data interpretation and cross-year comparisons across multiple measured datasets.
- Data focus: Automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, botanical (vegetation) composition; plus analysis of site heterogeneity and spatial patterns.
- Data collection context: Detailed measurement schedule (Table 1); notes on 2001 disruptions due to Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and a change in site management personnel; most site activities resumed under a defined protocol.

## Key datasets and measurements (results highlights)

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 weather: headline measures generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average; radiation stable; slightly cooler temperatures; soil moisture higher than in 2000.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Clear treatment hierarchy maintained across sampling periods; peak biomass in July–August each year.
  - 2001 biomass markedly higher than previous years, likely due to changes in personnel and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Normalisation against the control (C1) shows nitrogen and/or lime additions consistently boost productivity; significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
  - Separate ANOVAs on biomass (ln-transformed) support the above patterns.

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Liming raises pH: October 2001 pH ~6.19 in limed plots; ~6.38 in nitrogen-and-lime plots.
  - Nitrogen alone also raises pH, but less strongly.
  - Control plots show no significant pH change since baseline (August 1998).

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - July 2001 protocol consistent with 2000; no significant difference between surveyors.
  - 58% more total vegetation hits in 2001 than 2000, suggesting higher density, possibly due to removal of grazing since 1998.
  - Species shifts by treatment:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001.
    - Festuca spp. increased across treatments; most frequent in N and/or lime plots.
    - Improved plots (N and/or L) show more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots retain species linked to less fertile pastures (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
  - Diversity: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in nitrogen+lime plots, indicating potential initial decline in diversity with greater fertilization.
  - Multivariate: PCA mainly separates nitrogen and/or lime plots from controls/biocide plots; unimproved plots show association with bryophytes and low-nutrient indicators, while improved plots show more grasses/forbs typical of improved pastures.
  - Biomass correlations: higher biomass links with increased relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; decreases in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes as biomass rises.
  - Litter: more frequent in nitrogen and/or lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed; columns E and F show comparatively more acidic plots, likely exaggerated by higher counts of Controls/Biocide in those columns.
  - Underlying heterogeneity linked to column position and treatment distribution.

- 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
  - Outlying low-biomass plots scattered, while central plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., N&L plots in center).
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass (higher pH associated with higher biomass); no significant block effects.

## Data collection methods and analysis (context for use)

- Field protocols:
  - Above-ground biomass: five summer cuts per plot; random 0.5 m2 cells per sub-plot; biomass dried and weighed.
  - Botanical survey: Point Quadrat method with grid-based sampling; 25 hits per 0.5 m2 cell.
  - Relative cover surveys around minirhizotron tubes and disturbance/nutrient plots for secondary projects.
  - Soil sampling: 0–5 cm depth; pH measured in distilled water; soil moisture and related metrics collected periodically.
- Data management and analysis:
  - Weather data regularly downloaded; Genstat 5 used for ANOVA; PCA applied to major species data.
  - Tables and figures (e.g., 2001 monthly biomass, 2001 vs 2000 biomass changes, soil pH changes, PCA plots) illustrate treatment effects and temporal trends.

## Notable management events in 2001 affecting data

- FMD outbreak led to government restrictions; site visitation suspended Feb–May 2001; sampling proceeded under an approved protocol once restrictions eased.
- Site management change: Officer in Charge changed in May 2001; one biocide application in May was missed, later four applications completed.

## Data interpretation and implications for use

- Across-year comparisons are feasible and informative, particularly for:
  - Treatment effects of nitrogen and lime on biomass production and soil chemistry.
  - Relationships between soil pH and above-ground biomass.
  - Shifts in botanical composition associated with fertilization and liming.
- Data heterogeneity (spatial variation across columns and centrality) should be considered when integrating outputs with other datasets or across years.
- The 2001 disruptions (FMD-related access restrictions and personnel change) likely contributed to the observed biomass increase and should be accounted for in cross-year analyses or when combining with other experiments.

## Potential data products and next steps

- Time-series dashboards showing biomass by treatment across 1999–2001, with pH and rainfall overlays.
- Maps or plots illustrating spatial pH vs biomass patterns across site columns.
- PCA-based dashboards to explore treatment-driven shifts in plant community composition.
- Reports quantifying species-level responses to N and/or Lime, including diversity metrics by treatment.
- Documentation of data collection protocols and quality checks to support cross-study data integration.
