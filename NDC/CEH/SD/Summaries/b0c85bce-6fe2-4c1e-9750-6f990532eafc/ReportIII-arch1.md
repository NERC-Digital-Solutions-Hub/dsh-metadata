# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Large field experiment at Sourhope, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- A broad monitoring framework was established to contextualise detailed studies; measurements span 1999–2001 with baseline data from 1998.
- 2001 site management affected by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions (Feb–May); visitors restricted; subsequent sampling governed by a veterinary protocol.
- Management changes included a new Officer in Charge in May 2001.
- Biocide applications: first biocide in May 2001 was missed; four subsequent applications completed.

## 2. Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data: rainfall near long-term average (839 mm in 2001 vs 845 mm in 1999; 2000 had higher rainfall at 1209 mm).
- Radiation similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly lower in 2001; soil moisture modestly higher than earlier years.
- Weather station data regularly collected and shared with the data manager.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- A consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments throughout the sampling period; peak biomass consistently in July or August.
- 2001 biomass markedly higher than in previous years, likely due to a combination of personnel changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Biomass data were normalised against the C1 (control) treatment to assess treatment effects.
- ANOVA (on ln-transformed data) shows:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) plots and non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.
- Overall, nitrogen and lime treatments had the strongest positive impact on above-ground biomass.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Upper 5 cm soil pH responses:
  - Liming increased pH to an average of 6.19 in limed plots.
  - Nitrogen plus lime (N&L) plots reached an average pH of 6.38.
  - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed no significant change from baseline (1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- Point Quadrat protocol in July 2001 (201 mirrored 2000) showed no significant difference between surveyors; total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000 across all treatments.
- Treatment differences emerged in the most frequently encountered species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 (remaining most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots).
  - Festuca species (F. ovina and F. rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide (F. ovina) and N&L (F. rubra) plots.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more common in fertilised plots (especially those with both N and Lime).
  - Bryophyte-associated species and poorer pasture indicators (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) were more prevalent in untreated Control plots.
- Diversity:
  - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in the Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting a potential early decline in diversity with higher fertility.
- Multivariate pattern:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separates nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots show more uniform vegetation, while improved plots show more extreme shifts linked to F. rubra and associated species.
- Biomass concordance:
  - Abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlates with biomass.
  - Abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis tends to decline as biomass increases.
- Litter and turnover:
  - Litter frequency increases in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## 3. Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: Columns E and F (right-hand slope) tended to be more acidic than columns on the left, though this may be amplified by the higher proportion of Control/Biocide plots in those columns.
- Pattern supports underlying spatial heterogeneity in pH across the site, with some columns showing comparatively low pH in nitrogen and/or lime plots.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Biomass values show outliers with lower total biomass across treatments (examples listed by plot).
- Central site plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., N&L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
