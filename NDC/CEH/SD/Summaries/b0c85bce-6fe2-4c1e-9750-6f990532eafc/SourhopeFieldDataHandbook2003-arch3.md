# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview of this documented chunk
- Presents detailed soil profiles, analyses, and vegetation surveys for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on BLOCKS 4 and 5, plus ECOTRON plots.
- Includes horizon-level descriptions (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.), auger sampling, and soil chemical/physical properties.
- Provides associated vegetation survey data (plots within blocks), ECOTRON soil/vegetation data, and site metadata (grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage, parent material).

## Key soil profile features (BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5)
- BLOCK 4 (Rigg Foot, Sourhope):
  - Horizon sequence: LF (0–1 cm) amorphous fibrous; FH (1–4 cm) fibrous with fine roots; H (4–8 cm) dark, moist, weak blocky structure; Ah (8–29 cm) dark sandy silt loam with roots; Abg (29–40 cm) pinkish grey with mottling; B sg (40–61 cm) brown with mottling; C gx (61–95 cm) reddish-brown, massive/platy structure.
  - Notable features: abundant fine roots in upper horizons; presence of many igneous stones (andesite) in deeper horizons; clear vertical horizon boundaries; strong acidity in surface horizons.
  - Representative soil descriptors: color and matrix changes across horizons; mineral grains largely absent in LF/FH; stones become more frequent with depth.
- BLOCK 5 (Rigg Foot, Sourhope):
  - Horizon sequence: LF (0–1 cm) fibrous; FH (1–5 cm) semi-fibrous; H (5–7 cm) black; Ah (7–25 cm) very dark brown in sandy silt loam; AB (25–35 cm) grey with mild mottling; Bg (35–49 cm) reddish-brown with mottling; BCg (49–70 cm) reddish-brown to yellowish red with clay loam; Cg (70–100 cm) light reddish brown with clay loam.
  - Notable features: gleying tendencies in Bg/BCg horizons; abundant igneous stones; clay-rich lower horizons; clear smooth boundary between horizons; imperfect drainage classification.
  - Representative soil descriptors: increasingly clay-rich deeper horizons; significant mottling and horizon differentiation; pH values generally acidic with depth variation.
- Auger samples (BLOCKS 4 & 5) and ECOTRON:
  - Auger data include %N, %C, C:N ratios, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2), across horizon sub-samples (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and multiple plots.
  - ECOTRON plots provide compact summaries (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2) indicating acidic soils with notable organic and mineral fractions.

## Data collected and key metrics
- Soil chemical/physical properties per horizon:
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio; Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g); %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition; pH (H2O) and pH CaCl2.
  - Depth intervals and horizon names (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with boundary descriptions and texture notes.
  - Observed block-level variation in exchangeable cations and soil acidity; LOI values indicate organic content highest at surface horizons and declining with depth.
- Auger samples (BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5):
  - Depth-integrated measurements at multiple sub-samples per horizon (A, B, C, etc.), including %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH values.
  - Variation across plots/subplots showing heterogeneity in nutrient content and soil chemistry within blocks.
- Vegetation surveys:
  - Plot-level species totals and presence/absence data across plots 4A–4F and 5A–5F, with counts indicating species richness and composition (dominant grasses and indicator species noted in broader document context).
- ECOTRON PLOT:
  - Focused soil analysis (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2) to support controlled-environment studies and comparisons with field plots.

## Data management, governance, and accessibility
- Data are organized with clear horizon-level and plot-level identifiers (e.g., MLURI barcodes for each sample and horizon, plot/designation codes like 4A, 4B, etc.).
- Samples archived and described for long-term storage and traceability; linkage to wider networks (e.g., ECN) implicit in the dataset structure.
- The dataset is documented with appendices and associated documents (e.g., vegetation and soil data appendices) to support data sharing, interpretation, and governance in monitoring frameworks.

## Relevance to monitoring framework authors
- Demonstrates a multi-block, horizon-level soil monitoring approach integrated with vegetation surveys and controlled-plot design (including ECOTRON) to address environmental health and policy-relevant questions.
- Illustrates practical data governance considerations: standardized horizon naming, metadata clarity, archival storage, and linkage between field observations and laboratory analyses.
- Highlights data challenges relevant to monitoring frameworks: spatial heterogeneity across plots, presence of gleying and drainage differences, and variability in horizon properties that require robust statistical handling.
- Provides concrete examples of applying networked data sources (ECN/ECOTRON) to enhance long-term environmental monitoring and to support policy-informed decision-making.

Appendix references (e.g., Block 4/5 soil profiles, auger and vegetation datasets, ECOTRON data) indicate where detailed block- and plot-level data, species lists, and soil properties are stored for deeper analysis and governance.
