# Plant and soil animal diversity measurements from a disturbance and nitrogen addition experiment in an upland grassland site [NERC Soil Biodiversity Programme]

- Purpose and scope
  - Large-scale field experiment (Sourhope, Scotland) to understand how soil biodiversity and aboveground productivity respond to disturbance and nitrogen addition.
  - Data cover plant and microarthropod diversity, community composition, and aboveground biomass across controlled treatment gradients.

- Site description and experimental design
  - Location: Sourhope, Cheviot Hills, Southeast Scotland; upland semi-improved grassland, ~350 m elevation.
  - Climate and soil: ~1117 mm annual rainfall; humic brown soil (Sourhope series).
  - Experimental structure:
    - Five replicate blocks.
    - Each block initially contained six plots (12 m x 20 m) with randomly assigned treatments.
    - In December 1999, five replicated experimental sub-areas (3 m x 3 m) were created within a control area, resulting in five separate experimental areas.
    - Within each 3 m x 3 m area, a crossed, continuous gradient of nitrogen addition and disturbance was established as a 5 x 5 matrix (25 sub-plots, each 0.5 m2).
    - Treatments applied: nitrogen addition (0, 60, 120, 180, 240 kg N ha-1) and disturbance (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% ground cover disturbed).
    - Edge effects mitigated with a 0.5 m buffer zone around each sub-plot; random orientation of treatments following Burke and Grime (1996).
    - Nitrogen applications occurred February 2000 and April 2001.
    - Disturbance events: December 1999 and December 2000, simulating trampling via a specialized tool to disturb soil structure.

- Sampling and measurements
  - Plant diversity and productivity
    - Sampling dates: 1–18 August 2000; 20–23 August 2001.
    - Methods: point quadrat technique for relative abundance; biomass harvested from sub-plots (sward height 6 cm, August 2000 and 2001) and oven-dried to estimate aboveground biomass.
    - Diversity indices: Shannon-Wiener (H), evenness (J), and species richness (R) for plants and for microarthropods combined or separately.
  - Soil microarthropods
    - Extraction: soil cores (3 cm diameter, 5 cm depth) with Tullgren funnels for 96 hours; preserved in 70% ethanol with glycerol.
    - Taxa counted: mites and Collembola; 2000 and 2001 samples; 2001 species-level identifications for Collembola and mites where possible.
    - Indices: total counts and group-specific diversity; subsets include predatory vs. non-predatory mites.
  - Data structure and sampling scope
    - Matrix plots: 25 sub-plots per experimental area; data linked to block, main plot, matrix position, disturbance level, and nitrogen level.
    - Aboveground biomass: plant biomass per sub-plot (g m^-2) used as a functional productivity indicator.
    - Depth and sampling consistency: soil cores sampled to 5 cm depth; both 2000 and 2001 sampling events included.

      - Combines above-ground biomass with mite and Collembola counts; includes sampling method notes.
  - Quality control and provenance
    - Verification steps: numeric range checks, formatting conformity, and logical integrity checks.
    - Data quality disclaimer: NERC provides no warranty on accuracy or fitness for purpose; no liability for use of the data.
  - References and additional context
    - Foundational papers and handbooks documenting design, methods, and ecological context (e.g., Burke & Grime 1996; Begon et al. 1996; Hopkin 2000; Krantz 1978).

- GIS-relevant considerations for use
  - Spatial schema
    - Grid-based, crossed gradient design: defined blocks, main plots, matrix positions, and edge-buffer zones enable spatial joins and map-based visualization of treatment effects.
    - Location metadata: Sourhope site coordinates and grid references support georeferencing and integration with spatial layers (soil type, elevation, rainfall).
  - Data integration and mapping
    - Link plant and microarthropod data to precise sub-plot positions within each experimental area for rapid GIS plotting of diversity and biomass across the disturbance-nitrogen gradient.
    - Time series potential: year-wise data (2000 and 2001) enables temporal mapping of treatment impacts on communities and productivity.
  - Metadata and data reuse
    - Clear field definitions and data types facilitate schema mapping to GIS attribute tables.
    - References and documentation support reproducibility and integration with related Soil Biodiversity Programme datasets.
