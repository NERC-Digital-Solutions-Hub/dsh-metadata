# SUMMARY

## Overview
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Macaulay Institute), focusing on above-ground productivity, plant species composition, and diversity in response to experimental treatments.
- Primary aims: understand how management affects plant community structure and function, and how above- and below-ground processes link to ecosystem outcomes.

## Site design, treatments and management
- Experimental site: Rigg Foot at Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots randomized to treatments and subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
- Treatments (six total): 
  - Control 1 (no treatment)
  - Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Lime (CaCO3)
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4)
- Site-wide management: monthly mowing May–Sept to ~6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing on insecticide plots; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime as per treatment; previously grazed plots fenced in 1998 to exclude grazing animals.

## Data collection and key measures
- Above-ground productivity: cannoted via 0.5 m2 cell samples from sub-plots before each mowing; samples dried and weighed.
- Botanical surveys: baseline 1998; annual point analyses in July/August 2000, 2001, 2002 using 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid; bryophyte identification advanced in 2002.
- Soil and climate: on-site automatic weather station data (rainfall, radiation, temperatures); soil pH measured at ~5 cm depth; soil moisture measured in 2002; soil samples collected regularly since 1998.
- Data analyses: biomass comparisons across years via ANOVA (split-plot design); multivariate analyses including PCA for species-hits data; diversity assessed via Shannon indices.

## Main findings: productivity and treatment effects

### Mowing effect
- Regular mowing favored Festuca rubra over Festuca ovina, and reduced Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across most plots.
- Mosses/bryophytes expanded broadly, likely aided by ~6 cm sward height and absence of grazing, with bryophyte abundance increasing relative to vascular plants, particularly in unimproved plots.
- Mowing appears to act as a general disturbance change, influencing community composition toward stress-tolerant and moss-dominated states.

### Fertilisation effect (nitrogen and/or lime)
- Productivity (above-ground biomass) increased substantially with soil improvements; plots receiving N and/or lime show higher productivity than unfertilised plots.
- The strongest biomass production occurs in plots with both nitrogen and lime; however, signs suggest productivity may be peaking in these highly amended plots (potentially linked to soil pH near 7.0 and lower soil moisture).
- Lime raised soil pH markedly (to near 7 in the upper soil profile); nitrogen had a smaller positive effect on pH.
- In plots receiving both N and lime, higher pH combined with higher growth correlates with changes in moisture and plant stress responses.

### Insecticide effect
- Diversity (Shannon index) increased in the insecticide-treated plots in later years; however, the evidence for a direct causative link to insect herbivory is cautious, given limited mechanistic data.
- The discussion suggests that insecticide may indirectly benefit certain palatable species by reducing herbivory in a relatively infertile environment, aiding higher diversity if fertility remains limited.

### Trampling effect
- New C2 (insecticide/nitrogen/lime) plots introduced in 2002 show productivity reductions likely due to trampling during large-scope labelled 13CO2 pulses and related activities, highlighting how disturbance regimes beyond mowing and fertilisation influence outcomes.

## Plant community dynamics and functional groups

- Species composition shifts: improved plots (N and/or Lime) show higher frequencies of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unfertilised/unimproved plots retain more Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- CSR functional groups (Competitiveness, Stress tolerance, Ruderal): 
  - Stress-tolerators (S) expand in unimproved plots across years.
  - C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species increase notably in N&L plots.
  - SR/C-S-R groups decline with lime application and insecticide treatment.
  - Overall, functional-group composition demonstrates clear treatment- and year-wise shifts, with management altering ecological strategies represented in the community.

## Diversity and structure (Point Analysis and PCA)

- Point analysis shows consistent treatment differences by year, with improved plots clustering together in multivariate space.
- PCA of 2002 point-analysis data reveals distinct separation between improved (lime and/or nitrogen) and unimproved plots; some nitrogen plots resemble limed plots, while others align more with controls or insecticide treatments.
- Bryophyte hits increase across years, particularly in unimproved plots; species-level responses indicate many bryophytes decline in plots receiving nitrogen or lime.
- Shannon diversity indices: significant treatment effects emerge from 2000 onward; diversity increases in several treatments (notably with insecticide), but declines observed in 2002 for nitrogen & lime plots relative to baseline.

## Biomass and productivity trends (1999–2002)

- Long-term trend: biomass productivity increases across all treatments from 1999 to 2002, though the 2002 year shows a drop relative to 2001 in several plots.
- The nitrogen and lime combination remains the most productive; Control 2 plots show pronounced declines in 2002.
- Across the slope gradient, the lower-block positions tend to show greater declines in biomass, indicating micro-site effects on productivity.

## Soil-plant–water relationships

- Soil pH rose with lime; nitrogen also increases pH but to a lesser extent.
- There is a strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH, separating improved (more alkaline, drier) from wetter, unimproved plots.
- Positive correlation between soil pH and biomass productivity when considering all treatments; within N- or Lime-only plots, the relationship weakens; with N+L, the correlation may become negative due to moisture stress.

## Implications for monitoring and policy-relevant monitoring

- Monitoring measures shown to capture policy-relevant environmental health signals include:
  - Short- and long-term above-ground biomass as a productivity metric.
  - Species composition and relative abundance (including bryophytes) to detect shifts in community structure.
  - Functional-group composition (CSR and related categories) to assess ecological strategy changes under management.
  - Soil chemistry (pH), soil moisture, and their interactions with productivity.
  - Disturbance regimes (mowing frequency/height, grazing exclusion, trampling effects) and their impact on community dynamics.
- The study demonstrates the importance of long-term, multi-factor experiments to reveal complex interactions between management actions and ecological responses, informing adaptive monitoring frameworks and policy decisions.

## Overall conclusion
- Management actions—especially fertilisation (N and lime) and mowing—drive pronounced and interconnected changes in productivity, species composition, and functional group dynamics.
- The combination of nitrogen and lime yields the strongest productivity gains but may shift community dynamics toward less diverse, more competitive assemblages with higher pH and potential moisture stress.
- Biodiversity and bryophyte dynamics respond to disturbance and nutrient status, underscoring the need to monitor multiple facets of ecosystems (biomass, composition, functional types, and abiotic conditions) for informed environmental management and policy guidance.
