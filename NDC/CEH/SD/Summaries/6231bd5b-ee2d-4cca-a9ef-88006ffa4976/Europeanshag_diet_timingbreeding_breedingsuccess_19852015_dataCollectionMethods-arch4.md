# Data Collection methods

- Scope and time frame
  - Breeding phenology and success data collected for a sample of nests annually from 1987 to 2016 (excluding 1993 and 2003); 18 plots across the colony; nesting attempts ranged 35–266 per year.
  - Diet data from regurgitates collected on the Isle of May during chick-rearing (April–July) 1985–2014 (n = 863; median 29 samples/year).

- Nest monitoring and phenology
  - Nests checked every seven days from before laying until after fledging.
  - Lay date estimated as three days prior to the first recorded incubation; in some nests, laying confirmed by egg counts allowed more precise estimation using standard three-day laying intervals.
  - Maximum lay date error estimated as an overestimate of four days in worst-case scenarios.
  - For analysis, only the first laying attempt was used in core models; second clutches were excluded because lay date is not independent of first-clutch timing, although an extra analysis tested first-clutch lay date on overall breeding success.

- Population counts
  - Breeding pair counts were available for each year using standardized methods.

- Data quality, processing, and limitations
  - Measurement error expected to be smaller than within-year variance; consistency of accuracy assumed across nests and years.
  - Exclusion of nesting attempts with overlapping second clutches to maintain independence; overall breeding success analyses consider all attempts.

- Inshore temperature data (SST)
  - February–March SST data extracted annually from a region around Isle of May intersecting shag foraging areas (56°0′–56°4′ N, 2°7′–2°3′ W) from the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH).
  - Rationale: late winter temperature drives sandeel somatic investment and recruitment, and population-level lay date in shags is positively correlated with SST in this period.
  - SST values were averaged to produce a mean late-winter temperature per year.

- Diet analysis
  - Regurgitates collected during chick-rearing period (April–July) to estimate biomass proportions of prey types using standardized methods.
  - Collection timing strongly correlated with breeding season timing (collection date vs. median lay date: r = 0.86, n = 25 years).
  - Key diet components: 1+ group sandeels (~70% biomass) and 0 group sandeels (~12% biomass).
  - Seasonal shift in sandeel age class: 1+ group dominant early in the season (April–May) and declines to ~0.24 by August; 0 group sandeels become more available from June onward after metamorphosis.
  - 1+ group sandeels are larger with higher energy density than 0 group sandeels.
  - Hypotheses and predictions:
    - Higher proportion of 1+ sandeels in the diet is predicted to be associated with higher average breeding success.
    - Year-to-year variation in the proportion of 1+ sandeels is expected to be driven by the timing and rate of the shift between age classes relative to shag breeding season timing.
    - If 1+ sandeels are the principal diet and their availability aligns with breeding timing, a positive correlation is expected between the slope of change in the proportion of the two age classes within a year and the strength of directional selection on breeding timing.
