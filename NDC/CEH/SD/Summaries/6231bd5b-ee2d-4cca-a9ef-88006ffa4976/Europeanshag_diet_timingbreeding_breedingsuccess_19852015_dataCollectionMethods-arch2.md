# Data Collection methods

- Breeding phenology and success
  - Nest data collected annually 1987–2016 (sample sizes per year 35–266; data missing for 1993 and 2003)
  - Nests monitored in 18 plots across the colony; checks every seven days from before laying until after fledging
  - Lay date estimation: typically three days before first observed incubation; when eggs counted at first laying confirmation, lay date estimated with standard 3-day laying intervals; maximum possible lay-date error about four days
  - Core analyses use only first laying attempts; second clutches in failed nests excluded due to non-independence of lay/failure dates
  - An additional analysis tested whether first-clutch lay date affects overall breeding success; results showed no qualitative difference
  - Population counts of breeding pairs available for each year using standardised methods

- Inshore temperature data
  - Sea surface temperature (SST) data for February–March obtained annually from a specified source
  - Spatial area around the Isle of May chosen to overlap shag foraging distribution (approx. 56°0′–56°4′ N, 2°7′–2°3′ W)
  - Late winter SST used because it drives sandeel somatic investment and recruitment, and is positively correlated with population-level shag lay date
  - Yearly mean late winter temperature calculated by averaging monthly records

- Diet
  - Regurgitated food collected from shag chicks and adults during chick-rearing (April–July) 1985–2014
  - Total samples: 863 (median 29 samples/year; range 4–69)
  - Collection timing highly correlated with breeding season (median collection date vs. median lay date r = 0.86)
  - Major prey types: 1+ group sandeels (~70% biomass) and 0 group sandeels (~12%)
  - Seasonal shift: proportion of 1+ group sandeels declines from 1.00 in April to 0.24 in August
  - 1+ group sandeels are larger with higher energy density; hence higher breeding success expected when this group dominates diet
  - Year-to-year variation in 1+ group proportion likely driven by timing and rate of change in age-class composition within the year
  - Prediction: if 1+ group availability aligns with shag breeding, there should be a positive correlation between the slope of change in age-class proportions and the strength of directional selection on breeding timing

- Data handling and accessibility
  - Data are verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed prior to analysis
  - Outputs presented in clear formats (e.g., reports, maps, charts)
  - Created datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to enable access by others and broader use beyond single analyses
