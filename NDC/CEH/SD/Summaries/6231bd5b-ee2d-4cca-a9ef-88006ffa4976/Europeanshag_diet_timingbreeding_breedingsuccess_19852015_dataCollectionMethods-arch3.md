# Data Collection methods

- Study scope and data types
  - Long-term monitoring of the shag population on the Isle of May, focusing on breeding phenology, breeding success, inshore temperature, and diet.
  - Nested data include breeding events (lay dates, clutch details, success), population counts of breeding pairs, sea surface temperature (SST), and regurgitated prey samples.

- Nest monitoring protocol
  - Sample of nests recorded annually from 1987 to 2016 (range per year: 35–266 nests; data missing for 1993 and 2003).
  - Nests monitored every seven days from pre-laying through fledging.
  - Lay date estimation: typically three days prior to first incubation; in some cases, lay date inferred from first confirmed laying using standard three-day intervals.
  - Maximum lay-date error is an overestimate of four days for nests where laying followed just after a visit.
  - For core analyses, only first laying attempts were used because second clutches’ lay dates are not independent of first-clutch events; an additional analysis tested whether first-clutch lay date affected overall breeding success, finding no qualitative difference.
  - Population counts of breeding pairs available each year using standardized methods.

- Inshore temperature data (SST)
  - SST data extracted for February and March each year from a site around the Isle of May (bounded by ~56°0′–56°4′ N, 2°7′–2°3′ W) to capture late-winter temperature.
  - Rationale: late-winter SST is a key driver of sandeel somatic investment and recruitment and is positively correlated with population-level shag lay date.

- Diet data
  - Regurgitates collected from shag chicks and adults during the chick-rearing period (April–July) on the Isle of May, 1985–2014 (n = 863 samples; median 29 samples per year; range 4–69).
  - Collection dates are strongly linked to breeding season timing (median collection date vs. median lay date, r = 0.86).
  - Primary diet components: 1+ group sandeels (biomass ~70%) and 0 group sandeels (~12%).
  - Seasonal shift in diet: 1+ group sandeels are dominant early in the season, then largely replaced by 0 group sandeels as the season progresses; 1+ group are larger with higher energy density.
  - Implications for fitness: higher proportion of 1+ group sandeels in the diet is predicted to yield higher breeding success.
  - Year-to-year variation in the proportion of 1+ group sandeels is expected and likely driven by the timing and rate of change in the two age-class proportions relative to the shag breeding season.
  - Hypotheses: If 1+ group sandeels are the principal diet and their availability aligns with breeding timing, there should be a positive correlation between the slope of change in the diet’s age-class proportions within a year and the strength of directional selection on breeding timing.
