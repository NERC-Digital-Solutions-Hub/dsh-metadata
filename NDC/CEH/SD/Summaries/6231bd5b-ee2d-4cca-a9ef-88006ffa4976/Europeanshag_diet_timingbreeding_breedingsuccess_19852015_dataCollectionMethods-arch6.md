# Data Collection methods

- Breeding phenology and success
  - Data from a sample of nests collected annually from 1987 to 2016 (range 35–266 nests per year; missing data in 1993 and 2003).
  - Nests monitored in 18 plots across the colony; checks every seven days from before laying to after fledging.
  - Lay date estimation: typically three days before first recorded incubation; sometimes refined when the number of eggs was counted at first laying confirmation.
  - Measurement error: maximum lay-date error estimated at four days in the worst case; overall error variance expected to be small relative to within-year lay-date variance.
  - Core analyses used only the first laying attempt to ensure independence; if a second clutch occurred after a failed first clutch, that second attempt was not included in core analyses.
  - An additional analysis tested whether the lay date of the first clutch affected overall breeding success; found no qualitative difference between models, so subsequent models focused on first laying attempts.
  - Population counts of breeding pairs available for each year using standardized methods.

- Inshore temperature data
  - Sea surface temperature (SST) data for February and March were extracted around the Isle of May (approx. 56°0′–56°4′ N, 2°7′–2°3′ W) to align with shag foraging and recruitment dynamics.
  - Data source: Berlin/BSH SST dataset (or equivalent) for the specified area.
  - Rationale: late-winter temperature influences sandeel somatic investment and recruitment and is positively correlated with population-level lay date.

- Diet data
  - Regurgitates collected from shag chicks and adults during chick-rearing (April–July) at the Isle of May, 1985–2014 (n = 863; median 29 samples/year; range 4–69).
  - Collection timing correlates strongly with breeding season timing (median collection date vs. median lay date: r = 0.86; n = 25 years; p < 0.0001).
  - Primary diet components: 1+ group sandeels (~70% biomass) and 0 group sandeels (~12% biomass).
  - Seasonal shift: proportion of 1+ group sandeels declines from 1.00 in April to 0.24 in August, reflecting life history and metamorphosis of sandeel age classes.
  - 1+ group sandeels are larger with higher energy density; thus higher breeding success is predicted when their diet proportion is greater.
  - Year-to-year variation in the proportion of 1+ group sandeels is expected due to timing and rate of change in the two age classes during the breeding season.
  - Hypotheses: if 1+ group sandeels are most beneficial and align with shag availability, expect a positive correlation between the slope of change in the 1+ vs 0 group proportion within a year and the strength/direction of selection on breeding timing.

- Data considerations and integration
  - Data collected from multiple sources (nest observations, SST, diet regurgitates) are integrated to explore links between breeding timing, prey availability, and breeding success.
  - Emphasis on standardized methods and cross-year consistency to support longitudinal analyses and interpretation of potential selection on timing.
