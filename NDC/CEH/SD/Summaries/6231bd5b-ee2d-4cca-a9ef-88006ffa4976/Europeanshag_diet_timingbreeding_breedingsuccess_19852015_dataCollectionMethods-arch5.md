# Breeding phenology and diet of shags on the Isle of May

- Overview
  - Datasets cover breeding phenology and success, inshore sea surface temperature (SST), and diet composition for shags on the Isle of May.
  - Time spans: breeding data 1987–2016; diet data 1985–2014; SST data (late winter, February–March) for each year (yearly mean derived from the relevant area).
  - Data are sourced from field observations (nest monitoring, counts, regurgitate samples) and external SST databases.

- Data Collection: Breeding phenology and success
  - Nest monitoring
    - 18 plots across the colony; approximately 35–266 nests per year (data gaps for 1993 and 2003).
    - Nests checked every seven days from before laying until fledging.
  - Lay date estimation
    - Lay date typically set to three days before the first observed incubation.
    - In some cases, lay date is estimated from egg counts using standard three-day laying intervals.
    - Maximum potential lay-date error of four days; measurement error assumed consistent across nests and years.
  - Breeding success analyses
    - Core analyses focus on first laying attempts to ensure independence from subsequent clutches.
    - An additional analysis tested whether lay date of the first clutch affected overall breeding success; results were consistent with the main model.
  - Population counts
    - Yearly counts of breeding pairs available using standardized methods.

- Data Collection: Inshore temperature data
  - SST data for February–March were extracted around the Isle of May from a defined area overlapping shag foraging distribution (approx. 56°0′–56°4′ N, 2°7′–2°3′ W).
  - Rationale: late-winter SST influences sandeel recruitment and investment, and population-level lay date is correlated with SST.
  - Data handling: monthly SST records averaged to obtain a mean late-winter temperature per year.

- Data Collection: Diet
  - Regurgitate collection
    - Regurgitates collected on the Isle of May during chick-rearing (April–July) from 1985–2014 (n = 863; median 29 samples/year; range 4–69).
    - Collection dates strongly correlated with shag breeding-season timing (median collection date vs. median lay date: r = 0.86).
  - Diet composition
    - Primary prey: 1+ group sandeels (~70% biomass) and 0 group sandeels (~12%).
    - Seasonal shift: 1+ group sandeels decline from April to August as 0 groups emerge; reflects life history stages of sandeel cohorts.
    - 1+ group sandeels are larger and have higher energy density than 0 group.
  - Implications for fitness
    - Higher proportion of 1+ group sandeels in the diet is predicted to correspond to higher average breeding success.
    - Year-to-year variation in the proportion of 1+ group sandeels is expected to influence the strength of directional selection on breeding timing, depending on the timing and rate of shift within a year.

- Data quality, limitations, and governance
  - Data quality and uncertainty
    - Lay date accuracy is subject to a potential four-day error margin; however, within-year variance is expected to be more substantial than this measurement error.
    - Consistency in data collection and estimation methods maintained across nests and years; differences in accuracy are expected to be minimized by standardized protocols.
  - Completeness and gaps
    - Some years lack data (e.g., 1993, 2003 for nest counts); SST and diet data cover broader spans but are tied to the same annual framework.
  - System interoperability and metadata
    - Datasets combine field observations with externally sourced SST data and dietary regurgitate analyses; clear provenance and time-stamped records are essential for reuse.
  - Data stewardship considerations
    - Ensure comprehensive metadata detailing sampling methods, plot locations, measurement units, and data processing steps.
    - Maintain traceability between nest-level data, annual summaries, SST inputs, and diet composition outputs.
    - Provide guidance for updates or corrections (e.g., new years, re-analyses) and document any changes to estimation rules (e.g., lay-date computation).
  - Potential use and reuse
    - Enables analyses of how late-winter environmental conditions and diet shifts relate to breeding phenology and success.
    - Supports cross-year comparisons and integration with broader seabird foraging and climate studies.
