# Data Collection methods

- Breeding phenology and success
  - Nest data collected 1987–2016 (range per year 35–266 nests); no data in 1993 and 2003
  - Nests monitored every seven days from before laying until after last chick fledges
  - Lay date: typically three days before first incubation date; when eggs counted on first laying-confirmation occasion, lay date estimated with standard three-day laying intervals
  - Maximum lay-date error estimated at four days (nest with laying just after a visit)
  - If a nesting attempt failed and a second clutch launched at the same nest, the second attempt was excluded from core analyses to keep lay date independent from first clutch events; however, overall breeding success across all attempts was tested with an additional analysis
  - Subset analyses found no qualitative difference between models using only first laying attempts and models including all attempts; subsequent models use only first laying attempts
  - Population counts of breeding pairs available yearly using standardised methods

- Inshore temperature data
  - Sea surface temperature (SST) data for February and March each year from BSH data
  - Area centered on Isle of May, overlapping shag foraging distribution (approx. 56°0'–56°4' N, 2°7'–2°3' W)
  - Late winter temperature chosen because it drives sandeel somatic investment and recruitment, and because population-level lay date correlates with SST
  - Mean late-winter temperature calculated by averaging monthly records for each year

- Diet
  - Regurgitates collected on Isle of May during chick-rearing period (April–July) from 1985–2014 (n = 863; median 29 samples/year; range 4–69)
  - Collection dates strongly correlated with timing of shag breeding season (median collection date vs. median lay date: r = 0.86, n = 25 years, p < 0.0001)
  - Principal diet types: 1+ group sandeels (~70% biomass) and 0 group sandeels (~12%)
  - Seasonal shift: 1+ group sandeels decline from proportion 1.00 in April to 0.24 in August; 1+ group are larger with higher energy density
  - Implication: higher expected breeding success when the diet has a higher proportion of 1+ group sandeels
  - Year-to-year variation in 1+ group proportion is expected to be driven by the timing and rate of change in the proportion of the two age classes within the year relative to the shag breeding season
  - Prediction: positive correlation between the slope of change in proportion of the two age classes within a year and the strength of directional selection on timing of breeding

- Additional context
  - 1+ group sandeels are active in the water column in early spring (April/May) before burying for the rest of the year, then re-enter water column to spawn in midwinter
  - 0 group sandeels become available from June onward after metamorphosis from the larval stage
  - Overall aim is to relate diet age-class composition and timing to breeding success and selection on laying date
