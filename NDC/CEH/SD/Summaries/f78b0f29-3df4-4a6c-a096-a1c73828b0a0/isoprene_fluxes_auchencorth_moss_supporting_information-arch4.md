# Site Description

- Period and location: Measurements conducted between 8 June and 21 July 2015 at Auchencorth Moss (55°47'32.4" N, 3°14'35.3" W, 270 m a.s.l.), a peatbog site 4.4 km SW of Penicuik, Scotland. The site is mainly peatland (85%) with grassland across 5,612 km2.
- Study target: Concentrations and fluxes of isoprene using eddy covariance.
- Instrumentation and inlet setup:
  - Flux measurements with a quadrupole PTR-MS (IONICON) and 15 m of 1/4" O.D. PFA tubing sampling at ~10 L/min.
  - Inlet positioned 5 cm below ultrasonic anemometer (Windmaster Pro) at 3.1 m height.
  - PTR-MS operating parameters held constant to maintain E/N = 110 Td; drift tube pressure 196 Pa, voltage 450 V, temperature 331 K.
  - VOC-free air supplied via a zero-air generator with a catalytic VOC removal step (250°C) to monitor subtractable instrument background.
- Calibration:
  - Isoprene calibrations at start (09/06/2015) and end (15/07/2015) with ~1 ppmv isoprene diluted to achieve a 0–20 ppb calibration range.
  - Average instrument sensitivity during the period: 2.6 ncps/ppbv.
- Flux calculation approach:
  - Fluxes calculated per 25-minute averaging period using a two-dimensional rotation to set average vertical wind velocity to zero.
  - Cross-covariance used to identify time lag; initial lag Δt estimated from absolute maximum and then refined to 2.6 seconds (per Langford et al.) to reduce bias from a moving maximum search.
  - Fluxes filtered to remove periods with flux < 200 μg m⁻² h⁻¹ to improve signal-to-noise ratio.
  - Random flux error (RE) computed per Langford et al. and scaled by 1.96 to yield a 95% confidence limit for each flux measurement.
- Data processing and corrections:
  - Custom LabVIEW package used; hourly background subtraction based on measurements from the zero-air generator.
  - Flux attenuation correction applied to account for eddy flux loss at frequencies above the PTR-MS 5 Hz response time, using the attenuation factor involving fm, τc, and α (specific form provided in the documentation).
  - Displacement height and canopy considerations used to determine relevant turbulence corrections (d = 2h/3 with h = 0.4 m, yielding d ≈ 0.27 m).
- Quality assessment:
  - Stationarity checks following Foken and Wichura: compare 25-min flux to the average of five 5-min fluxes; large percentage differences (typically >60%) flag non-stationarity.
  - Turbulence statistics check: compare observed σw/u* to the Monin-Obukhov-based prediction σw/u* = C1 (z/L)^{c2}, with stability-dependent C1 and C2 values (Table 1 in the document); divergences >250% indicate poorer data quality.
  - All data retained; missing flux periods due to instrument downtime or insufficient data points; users may apply their own quality thresholds.
