# ElementalanalysisofsoilinNingboWatershed_metadata

## Overview
- Elemental analysis of topsoil (0–20 cm) from the Ningbo watershed, eastern China, collected in March 2016.
- 80 samples across three land-use types: 40 cropland, 11 orchards, 29 forests.
- Purpose: source identification of trace elements in peri-urban soils; use of Pb isotopes as tracers; multivariate analyses planned (correlation, regression, PCA).

## What was recorded and for what purpose
- Measured elements (ICP-MS): Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sr, Tl, Zr; units: mg/kg.
- Measured elements (XRF): Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, Mn, Nb, P, Pb, Rb, Si, Sr, Ti; units: mg/kg (where applicable).
- Lead isotope ratios recorded: 206/207, 208/207 (unitless).
- Geographic metadata: latitude, longitude, altitude (one altitude value missing for sample AMCS040).
- For traceability and interpretation: Pb isotopic positions used to detect anthropogenic Pb input.

## Sampling design and data collection
- Samples composed of five sub-samples collected in a 2 m2 grid per site.
- Sampling sites: 40 cropland, 11 orchard, 29 forest.
- Collection protocol: stainless steel hand auger; samples dried, then ground to a fine powder (except for pH/texture analysis).
- Sub-sampling and preparation specifics provided for ICP-MS and XRF analyses (digestion with nitric acid for ICP-MS; XRF analysis performed in batches with certified reference materials).

## Analytical methods and QA/QC
- ICP-MS analysis: Thermo Scientific iCAP Q with direct solution acquisition; calibration and internal standards; 10 replicates per sample for Pb isotopes; bracketing standards used for Pb isotope correction.
- XRF analysis: Rigaku Nex CG benchtop XRF; batches of 9 (8 samples + 1 certified reference material); analysis time ~13 minutes per sample.
- QA/QC: certified reference materials used (ISE-921 river clay for ICP-MS; Pb isotopic standards LGC VHGLISPB1-50); recovery rates for elemental contents ranged from ~79% to ~110%.
- Pb isotope measurement details: dwell times 300 ms for 206Pb, 207Pb, 208Pb; corrections applied using bracketing standards.

## Study rationale and analysis approach
- Goal: identify sources of trace elements in peri-urban soils in eastern China.
- Data intended for multivariate analyses (correlation, regression, PCA) and isotopic tracing to distinguish natural vs. anthropogenic inputs.

## Provenance, stewardship, and collaboration
- Sample collection by the Institute for Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
- Sample analysis by Queen's University Belfast.
- Data linked to a published study: Sun et al. 2018 in Exposure and Health (Source identification of trace elements in peri-urban soils in eastern China).

## Missing data and data completeness
- One altitude value missing (sample AMCS040).
- Comprehensive metadata on sampling, preparation, and analytical QA/QC provided to support interpretation and reuse.

## Metadata quality and data usability considerations for Data Leaders
- Rich QA/QC metadata: recovery rates, LODs, CRC materials, corrections for Pb isotopes, replicates, and detailed method descriptions enhance data reliability and reuse.
- Clear units and measurement contexts: ICP-MS and XRF elemental concentrations with specified units; Pb isotopes presented as unitless ratios.
- Provenance and collaboration details support data governance, reproducibility, and cross-institution reuse.
- Some gaps exist (e.g., missing altitude for one sample) and the data span multiple platforms/methods, underscoring the need for harmonized metadata standards and clear data lineage for cross-system integration.
