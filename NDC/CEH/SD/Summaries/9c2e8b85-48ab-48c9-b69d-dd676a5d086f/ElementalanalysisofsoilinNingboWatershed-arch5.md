# ElementalanalysisofsoilinNingboWatershed_metadata

## Overview
- Soil elemental survey of the Ningbo peri-urban catchment, China, using ICP-MS and XRF to quantify trace elements and lead isotopes.
- Data published in Sun et al. 2018 (Exposure & Health) for source identification of trace elements in peri-urban soils.
- Below-LOD data handled by assigning half-LOD; CRM recoveries and LODs provided to enable interpretation.

## Data scope and content
- Sample set: 80 soil samples (0–20 cm depth) from cropland (40), orchards (11), and forests (29).
- Analytes by ICP-MS: Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Zr (units mg/kg).
- Analytes by XRF: Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, Mn, Nb, P, Pb, Rb, Si, Sr, Ti (units mg/kg).
- Pb isotopes: 206/207, 206/208, 207/208 (unitless).
- Additional data: latitude, longitude, altitude; sample collection and site metadata; soil sub-sample composition.
- Publication details: Sun L, Carey C, Yang L, Chen LD, Ki SJ, Zhao FK, Zhu YG, Meharg C, Meharg AA (2018) “Source identification of trace elements in peri-urban soils in eastern China.” Exposure & Health. DOI provided.

## Location and timing
- Location: Ningbo, China (peri-urban catchment).
- Timing: Field collection conducted in March 2016.

## Data collection and sampling design
- Sampling: 0–20 cm soil; 40 cropland, 11 orchard, 29 forest soils; each sample comprised five sub-samples from a 2 m² grid.
- Collection tools: stainless steel hand auger; samples stored in snap-sealed polypropylene bags.
- Sample preparation: drying, sieving, and milling (except for pH/soil texture) to a fine powder.

## Analytical methods and QA/QC
- ICP-MS analysis (Thermo Scientific iCAP Q) for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, P, Pb, and Pb isotopes; direct solution mode with auto-sampler.
- XRF analysis (Rigaku Nex CG) for Zn, Ca, K, and other elements.
- Reagents: BDH Prolabo acids; multi-point calibration with blanks and internal standard; three replicates per sample.
- QA/QC for ICP-MS: eight standards + blank; recovery checks; CRM-based quality control.
- QA/QC for XRF: batches of nine (eight samples + certified reference material + blank); recovery analysis.
- Pb isotope analysis: 206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/207Pb measured with 300 ms dwell times; bracketing with certified Pb isotope standards (LGC Standards).
- Data quality indicators: CRM recoveries for ICP-MS (approx. 79–110% across elements) and XRF recoveries reported; LODs reported; half-LOD substitution for below-LOD values.

## Provenance and responsibilities
- Sample collection: Institute for Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
- Sample analysis: Queen's University Belfast.
- Publication and data dissemination: Sun et al. 2018 (Exposure & Health); DOI provided.

## Missing data and limitations
- One altitude value missing for sample AMCS040.
- Potential variability due to different land-use types (cropland, orchard, forest) and multiple analytical techniques (ICP-MS vs XRF) with differing detection capabilities.
- Pb isotopic data included to trace anthropogenic inputs, adding interpretive value amid potential natural background variations.

## Data interpretation and usage notes for data stewards
- Metadata comprehensively documents depth, location, sampling design, analytical methods, QA/QC, and data transformation (LOD handling).
- Values below LOD are managed with half-LOD approach, and CRM recoveries/LODs are provided to support data interpretation.
- Pb isotopes and multi-method measurements enable source attribution studies and cross-method consistency checks.
- Clear assignment of data custodians and publication reference supports traceability, reuse, and governance.
- Any future sharing should preserve the detailed QA/QC metadata and ensure consistent handling of non-detects and isotopic data.
