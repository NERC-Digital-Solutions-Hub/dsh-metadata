# ElementalanalysisofsoilinNingboWatershed_metadata

## Overview
- Study objective: elemental analysis of peri-urban soils in Ningbo, eastern China to identify sources of trace elements and anthropogenic Pb input.
- Data types: soil element concentrations measured by ICP-MS (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sr, Tl, Zr) and XRF (Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, Mn, Nb, P, Pb, Rb, Si, Sr, Ti); Pb isotopic ratios (206/207, 206/208, 207/208) (all units except Pb isotopes are mg/kg dry soil; Pb isotopes are unitless).
- Publication and provenance: data published in Sun et al. 2018 (Exposure & Health); DOI provided. CRM recoveries and LODs reported for samples below LOD (half-LOD used for analysis).

## Data collected and scope
- Study area and samples: Ningbo, China; 0–20 cm topsoil collected; 80 samples across land uses—40 cropland, 11 orchards, 29 forests.
- Sampling design: each sample comprised five sub-samples within a 2 m2 grid; collected with a stainless hand auger; samples stored in snap-sealed bags.
- Location data: latitude, longitude, and altitude recorded; one altitude value missing (sample AMCS040).

## Methods and QA
- Laboratory analyses:
  - ICP-MS (Thermo Scientific iCAP Q) for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, P, Pb, and Pb isotopes after nitric acid digestion; dwell times and calibration described; internal standard used.
  - XRF (Rigaku Nex CG) for Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, Mn, Nb, P, Pb, Rb, Si, Sr, Ti, Zn.
  - Digestion and extraction: BDH reagents used; multiple standards and blanks for calibration.
  - Pb isotopes: analysed with ICP-MS after nitric acid digestion; use of certified Pb isotope standards; bracketing to correct for instrumental drift.
- Quality control:
  - Certified reference materials (CRM) used in ICP-MS and XRF analyses; recovery rates typically between 79% and 110%.
  - Pb isotopic measurements validated with bracketing standards; ten replicates per sample/blank/standard averaged.
  - Data handling for non-detects: below-LOD values treated as half-LOD.
- Data context:
  - Basic soil properties collected; isotopic tracers used for identifying anthropogenic Pb inputs.
  - Multi-variate analyses (correlation, regression, PCA) and isotopic tracers applied to interpret sources.

## Data content and formats
- Reported elements and isotopes:
  - ICP-MS: Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sr, Tl, Zr.
  - XRF: Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, Mn, Nb, P, Pb, Rb, Si, Sr, Ti, Zn.
  - Pb isotopes: 206/207, 206/208, 207/208 (unitless).
- Sample context: 40 crop, 11 orchard, 29 forest soils; 0–20 cm depth; location coordinates included.
- Data provenance: collected by the Institute for Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences; analysed by Queen’s University Belfast.
- Documentation: detailed methods and QA data provided; supplementary materials (e.g., Table S1) referenced for recovery data.

## Provenance and governance
- Data origin and responsibility:
  - Sample collection by Institute for Urban Environment, CAS; analysis by Queen’s University Belfast.
  - Publication venue and DOI provided for traceability.
- Metadata and transparency:
  - Comprehensive QA metadata included (CRMs, LODs, recovery rates, isotopic standards, replicates).
  - Transparency around data processing decisions (e.g., half-LOD treatment for below-LOD values).
  - One missing altitude value noted; otherwise spatial and methodological metadata are included.
- Data sharing and accessibility:
  - Data and methods are described in a peer-reviewed publication; supports reuse for policy-relevant monitoring and source attribution.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates end-to-end monitoring workflow:
  - Clear aim aligned with policy scrutiny of environmental health measures.
  - Stakeholder-informed design through collaboration between research institutions.
  - Robust data discovery, verification, and QA processes (CRM, LOD, isotopic standards).
  - Documentation of data provenance, metadata completeness, and data transformation steps.
  - Public dissemination via publication and supplementary data enabling transparency and governance.
- Addresses common obstacles for monitoring authors:
  - Data quality and metadata completeness are explicitly managed (including half-LOD handling and CRM recoveries).
  - Data are tied to a clear policy-relevant outcome: identifying sources of trace elements and anthropogenic Pb in peri-urban soils.
  - Provides a replicable framework for future monitoring efforts in similar peri-urban contexts.
- Policy implications:
  - Baseline concentration ranges and Pb source attribution can inform regulatory decisions and urban planning.
  - Pb isotopic approach offers a rigorous method for distinguishing anthropogenic vs natural Pb inputs in soil health assessments.

## Notable considerations for future monitoring
- Data gaps and enhancements:
  - One missing altitude datum; ongoing need for complete metadata in large-scale soil surveys.
  - 2016 dataset; consider updating with newer samples to maintain currentness and relevance.
- Data accessibility and interoperability:
  - Publishing with full QA details supports data sharing and governance; continued emphasis on standardized units, reference materials, and metadata Schemas would facilitate cross-study comparisons.
