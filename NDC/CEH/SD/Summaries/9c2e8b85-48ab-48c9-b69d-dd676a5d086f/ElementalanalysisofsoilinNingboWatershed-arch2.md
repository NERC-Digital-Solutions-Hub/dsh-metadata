# ElementalanalysisofsoilinNingboWatershed_metadata

## Objective and scope
- Elemental analysis of Ningbo peri-urban soils to identify trace element sources, including anthropogenic Pb input.
- 80 topsoil samples (0–20 cm) from cropland (40), orchard (11), and forest (29) in Ningbo, eastern China.
- Pb isotopes (206/207, 208/207) included to distinguish natural versus anthropogenic Pb.
- Multivariate analysis planned (e.g., correlation, regression, PCA) with isotopic tracers.

## Data collected and sampling design
- Geographic coverage: Ningbo, China; coordinates and altitude recorded (one altitude missing).
- Sampling dates: March 2016.
- Sampling scheme: composite of five sub-samples within a 2 m² grid per site; stainless steel auger; samples stored in snap-sealed bags.
- Sample preparation: drying, sieving, and milling (except for pH/texture) prior to analysis.

## Analytical methods and QA/QC
- ICP-MS (Thermo Scientific iCAP Q) used for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, P, Pb, Zn; direct solution acquisition with nitric acid digestion.
- XRF (Rigaku Nex CG) used for Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, Mn, Nb, P, Pb, Rb, Si, Sr, Ti.
- Pb isotopes measured by ICP-MS with bracketing Pb standards; isotopic ratios corrected against certified Pb standards.
- Certified reference materials and blanks used for QA/QC (e.g., ISE-921 river clay; Pb isotopic standard VHGLISPB1-50 / VHG-LISPB1-50).
- Recovery and detection limits (CRM recoveries and LODs) provided for both ICP-MS and XRF to enable interpretation.

## Data content and units
- ICP-MS elements: Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sr, Tl, Zr; units: mg/kg (soil dry weight), with Pb isotopes as unitless ratios.
- XRF elements: Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, Mn, Nb, P, Pb, Rb, Si, Sr, Ti.
- Metadata: latitude, longitude, altitude (one missing); sample naming and replication details; measurement details (replicates and standards).

## Provenance and collaborative context
- Field collection by Inst. for Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
- Laboratory analysis by Queen’s University Belfast.
- Publication documenting the data: Sun L, Carey C, Yang L, Chen LD, Ki SJ, Zhao FK, Zhu YG, Meharg C, Meharg AA (2018) Exposure & Health; DOI: 10.1007/s12403-018-0290-1.

## Data usage for environmental monitoring
- Enables standardised assessment of soil elemental health and potential anthropogenic Pb input in peri-urban environments.
- Suitable for integration into time-series monitoring, spatial analyses (maps/charts), and policy performance evaluations.
- Data structure supports replicable QA/QC via included CRM recoveries and LODs; coordinates enable GIS-based monitoring and portal uploads.

## Limitations and notes
- One altitude value (AMCS040) missing.
- Pb isotopic data require correction using bracketing standards; detailed QA/QC data available in supplementary material (e.g., Table S1 for recoveries).
