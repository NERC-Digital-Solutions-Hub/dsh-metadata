# ElementalanalysisofsoilinNingboWatershed_metadata

- Background
  - Elemental analysis of topsoil (0–20 cm) in the Ningbo peri-urban watershed, eastern China.
  - Soils analyzed for multiple elements using ICP-MS (for certain elements) and XRF (for others); lead isotopes measured as well.
  - Published in Sun et al. 2018 (Exposure & Health) with CRM recoveries and LODs reported to aid interpretation.

- What was recorded and for what purpose
  - Measured topsoil concentrations of:
    - ICP-MS: Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sr, Tl, Zr (units: mg/kg, soil dry weight).
    - XRF: Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, Mn, Nb, P, Pb, Rb, Si, Sr, Ti.
  - Lead isotope ratios: 206/207, 206/208, 207/208 (unitless) to detect anthropogenic Pb inputs.
  - Sample set: 80 samples across land-use types—40 cropland, 11 orchard, 29 forest.
  - Purpose: identify sources and distributions of trace elements in peri-urban soils; multivariate analyses and isotopic tracers used to interpret sources.

- Where and when data were collected
  - Location: Ningbo, China (geocoordinates and altitude recorded; one altitude value missing for sample AMCS040).
  - Sampling period: March 2016.
  - Sample types: soils collected as composites of five sub-samples within a 2 m² grid.

- How data were collected and analyzed
  - Sample collection and preparation:
    - 0–20 cm soils collected with stainless hand auger; samples mixed from five sub-samples per site; stored in snap-sealed bags.
    - Dried (freeze-dried), sieved, and milled (for most analyses).
  - Analytical methods:
    - ICP-MS (Thermo Scientific iCAP Q) for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, P, Pb, Zn, and Pb isotopes after nitric acid digestion.
    - XRF (Rigaku Nex CG) for Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, Mn, Nb, P, Pb, Rb, Si, Sr, Ti.
    - Reagents and standards described; calibration against multiple standards; internal standard used; replicates for each sample.
  - Quality control:
    - Certified reference materials used for both ICP-MS and XRF (e.g., ISE-921 river clay; blank).
    - Pb isotopic measurements corrected using bracketing certified Pb standards.
    - Recovery checks reported; ICP-MS recoveries generally within ~79–110% (with element-specific values listed) and XRF recoveries within similar ranges; LOD values provided per element.
  - Pb isotopes:
    - Pb isotopic compositions measured to distinguish anthropogenic vs. natural Pb sources.

- Metadata and data provenance
  - Project lead institutions: Institute for Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (sampling) and Queen's University Belfast (analysis).
  - Data included alongside methodological details to enable interpretation and potential reuse.
  - Data interpretation notes: multivariate analyses (correlation, regression, PCA) and isotopic tracers used to identify element sources.

- Missing data and limitations
  - One missing altitude data point (sample AMCS040).
  - Lead isotope data and isotopic corrections rely on bracketing standards; interpretation may depend on quality and representativeness of standards.
  - Complex matrix effects and cross-method comparisons (ICP-MS vs. XRF) require careful data integration.

- Data usage context for analysts
  - Suitable for exploring spatial distribution of elements across land-use types (cropland, orchard, forest) in peri-urban China.
  - Enables source apportionment via Pb isotopes and multivariate analysis to identify potential anthropogenic inputs (e.g., industrial, agricultural, traffic-related sources).
  - Provides detailed QA/QC metadata and performance indicators to assess data reliability and comparability with other datasets.
