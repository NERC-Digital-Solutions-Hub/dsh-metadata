# Physiology and stable isotope ecology of moss growth for modelling spatial and temporal climatic signals NERCDMP-555 - monthly field and dark adapted PAM fluorescence measurements

## Overview
- Study of moss physiology and stable isotope ecology to model spatial and temporal climatic signals.
- Field sites include Dersingham Bog, Brandon Country Park, and Wicken Fen with various moss species identified for comparability to palaeoclimate work.
- Fieldwork conducted approximately monthly from April 2017 to September 2018.
- Emphasis on generating structured datasets for use in climate signal modelling and cross-site comparisons.

## Field work and sampling
- Target species identified to represent diverse moss lifeforms and growing conditions; vouchers verified by bryologists.
- On each visit: three samples (approx. 2 x 2 x 2 cm) of each target species collected and stored for analysis.
- Permissions obtained from landowners/managers prior to field work.
- Sample collection supported by field notes detailing location, species, and collection session.

## Measurements and analyses in the field and lab
- Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (F, Fm, PAR, ETR) taken at moss tips using a Walz MINI-PAM II:
  - Three measurements in the field, followed by dark adaptation (≥ 30 minutes) and three dark measurements (F', Fm').
  - Calculations: fluorescence yield (dark and light), non-photochemical quenching, and electron transport rate.
- Water content and tissue analyses:
  - Fresh moss samples weighed, dried at 70°C to determine relative water content (RWC).
  - Dry moss subjected to cellulose extraction; duplicate sampling and standard protocols followed.
  - Water extracted from fresh moss by cryogenic vacuum distillation; field water samples collected and precipitation recorded.
  - Additional sub-sample moss analyzed for enzymatic sucrose content.
  
## Isotope analyses and standards
- Water isotopes (D/H and 18O/16O) analyzed at Lancaster Environment Centre; samples filtered and measured in duplicate.
- δD and δ18O quantified with IRMS; calibration against VSMOW, IAEA standards, and lab in-house standards.
- Oxygen isotopes analyzed by EA-IRMS at Cambridge; calibration to V-SMOW with inter-laboratory IAEA standards; precision better than 0.4‰.
- Carbon isotope analyses performed at Cambridge; use of IAEA standards; precision better than 0.1‰.
- Quality metrics and precision explicitly reported for isotope measurements.

## Datasets and data catalog
- Four CSV files comprising the dataset:
  - Royles_Field_data_by_time: structured fields for measurement types (RWC, C13, O18), session metadata, locations, species, and notes.
  - Royles_RWC_and_Isotope_data: sample-cellulose reference data, wet/dry weights, dry weights, and isotopic ratios (d13C, d18O, etc.).
  - Royles_Sample_Number_Key: mapping between sample references and metadata (date, location, species, herbarium information).
  - Royles_Water_Samples: dates, locations, water type (fresh or leaf distillate), source, and isotopic values (d18O, dD).
- Data fields documented to enable traceability, replication, and reuse in climate-related modelling.

## Data quality, standards, and provenance
- Field methods and lab analyses aligned with established references and standard protocols (e.g., cellulose extraction technique, isotope analysis procedures).
- Isotopic data calibrated and reported against internationally recognized scales (VSMOW, IAEA standards) with documented precision.
- Voucher specimens and field notes linked to sample identifiers to ensure provenance and reproducibility.

## Governance, access, and community relevance
- Field permissions secured; specimen verification supports data credibility and traceability.
- Data products are organized to support spatial and temporal modelling of climatic signals across multiple moss species and sites.
- Clear potential for integration with wider data communities focusing on palaeoclimate research and moss-based proxies.
