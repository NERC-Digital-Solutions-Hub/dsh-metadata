# Physiology and stable isotope ecology of moss growth for modelling spatial and temporal climatic signals NERCDMP-555 - monthly field and dark adapted PAM fluorescence measurements.

## Overview
- A field-based study combining moss physiology and stable isotope ecology to model spatial and temporal climatic signals.
- Fieldwork conducted at Dersingham Bog, Brandon Country Park, and Wicken Fen between April 2017 and September 2018.
- Aimed to link moss growth responses and isotopic signatures to climate variables using monthly measurements and controlled fluorescence assays.

## Sampling design and target taxa
- Approximately monthly sampling from April 2017 to September 2018.
- Targeted a range of moss lifeforms under diverse conditions to provide analogues for palaeoclimate work.
- Voucher specimens identified and verified by bryologists; permissions obtained from landowners/managers.
- Target species include Aulacomnium palustre, Dicranum scoparium, Sphagnum spp. (various), Pleurozium schreberi, Polytrichum spp., among others, across multiple habitats (bog heathland, heathland, fen, shaded woodland).

## Measurements and methods
- In-field chlorophyll fluorescence at moss tips using Walz MINI-PAM II:
  - Measurements: F, Fm, PAR, ETR; followed by dark-adapted measurements F', Fm'.
  - Calculations: fluorescence yield (Φ), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), electron transport rate (ETR = 0.84 × PAR × 0.5 × Φ).
- Water content and tissue analysis:
  - Relative water content (RWC) determined from fresh/dry weights after drying to constant mass at 70°C.
  - Cellulose extracted from dried moss (Soxhlet method); water extracted from fresh moss via cryogenic vacuum distillation.
  - Fresh water samples collected at each site; precipitation measured in nearby Ely.
  - Enzymatic sucrose content analysis performed on sub-samples.
- Isotope analyses:
  - Water and moss distillates analyzed for δD and δ18O; measurements calibrated to VSMOW with inter-lab standards.
  - δ18O analyzed by EA-IRMS at Cambridge; δD analyzed by Isoprime100 IRMS at Lancaster Environment Centre; precision: δD ±1‰, δ18O ±0.5‰.
  - Carbon isotopes (δ13C) measured by EA-IRMS at Cambridge; precision better than 0.1‰; standards calibrated to IAEA references.
  - Standards and calibration traceable to international scales (IAEA, V-SMOW/GISP).

## Data and datasets
- Four CSV datasets:
  - Royles_Field_data_by_time
  - Royles_RWC_and_Isotope_data
  - Royles_Sample_Number_Key
  - Royles_Water_Samples
- Data fields cover sample IDs, dates, locations, species, measurement types (RWC, C13, O18, D/H), site sessions, and descriptive notes.
- Detailed data dictionaries accompany fields (e.g., sample-cellulose numbers, reference numbers, collection dates, locations, species, and notes).

## Field logistics and ethics
- Field permissions secured from landowners/managers prior to collection.
- On-site collection included three samples per target species per visit; voucher specimens documented and verified.
- Data collection integrated with standard, transparent metadata practices.

## Quality assurance and standards
- In-field replication: three measurements per sample, plus three dark measurements after dark adaptation.
- Isotope analyses included duplicates and cross-lab calibration standards.
- Use of established protocols for cellulose extraction, water extraction, and isotope analyses with documented precision.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates an integrated, multi-modal data collection approach (physiology, hydrology, and stable isotopes) to monitor climate signals via biotic proxies.
- Emphasizes robust metadata, standardized laboratory and field procedures, sample provenance, and transparent calibration/standards.
- Provides a structured data architecture (four datasets) that supports reproducibility and cross-study comparability.

## Data governance and accessibility considerations
- Data are organized into clearly defined datasets with explicit measurement methods and standards.
- Study notes land permissions and specimen verification, indicating attention to data provenance and permissions, though explicit public data sharing policies are not detailed.
- Metadata richness facilitates data governance, quality assessment, and potential data sharing within governance frameworks.

## Key takeaways for monitoring design
- Moss physiology and stable isotope measurements can serve as proxies for modelling climatic signals when collected via standardized, repeatable protocols.
- A disciplined approach to sampling frequency, target taxa, and habitat diversity enhances representativeness for climate-related inferences.
- Comprehensive QA, calibration against standards, and transparent data structure are critical for monitoring outputs intended to inform policy and future decisions.
