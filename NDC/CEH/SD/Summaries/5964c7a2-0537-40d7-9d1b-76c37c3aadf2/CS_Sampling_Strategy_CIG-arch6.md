# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Outline the sampling framework and land classification system underpinning Countryside Survey GB from 1978 to 2007, showing how data were collected, classified, and used to produce national and country-specific habitat estimates.
- Core idea: Use a stratified, random sampling design built on an evolving ITE Land Classification to ensure representative, comparable time-series data and support policy-relevant reporting.

## Core concepts and evolution

- Stratified sampling to ensure representativeness and reduce bias
  - Stratification carved GB into land classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
  - Early approach used 1 km squares; sampling within each land class aimed to capture within-class variability.
- ITE Land Classification
  - Began in the 1970s, developed from local vegetation classification to a national environmental stratification.
  - Initial output: 32 land classes derived from center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; surrounding squares also classified.
  - Purpose: provide a framework to allocate field survey effort across GB and extrapolate to national estimates.
- Field sampling framework
  - CS1978: eight samples per land class (256 total), using 1 km squares classified into 32 classes; national estimates based on mean habitat area per class multiplied by class area.
  - CS1984: increased effort to 12 km squares per class (384 total) to improve precision; estimates still tied to the 1978 Land Classification.
  - CS1990: shifted to “All Squares” Land Classification; expanded to include all 1 km squares with a total of 508 squares surveyed; linked to Land Cover Mapping and updated data collection.
  - CS2000: moved toward classifying every GB square, enabling separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) and Welsh-specific reporting; introduced 40 strata with targeted representation; added upland habitat module.
  - CS2007: introduced Wales-only reporting refinements (Welsh sub-classes, increased Welsh squares), expanding to 45 strata; maintained England representation, adjusting some class counts.

## Countryside Survey sampling by era

- CS1978 ( Initial Land Classification and field survey)
  - 32 land classes derived from 1228 centre squares; 4 surrounding squares counted per centre.
  - Total classified squares: about 6,039 km^2.
  - Survey: 8 squares per land class (256 total).
  - National estimates: habitat area per square x area of each land class.
  - Outputs: foundational national estimates and methodological framework.

- CS1984 (2nd field survey)
  - 12 km squares per class (total 384); eight additional squares visited per class (50% increase).
  - National estimates still referenced the 1978 Land Classification.
  - Outputs: change statistics published; refined understanding of landscape changes.

- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square (based on major climatic, geological, physiographic surrogates).
  - Field survey: 508 squares.
  - National estimates: based on 1990 Land Classification; a Land Cover Map for GB linked to the programme.
  - Outputs: comprehensive national habitat estimates; methodology modernized for regional/local reporting.

- CS2000 (Separate country estimates; expanded coverage)
  - Aimed to enable England & Wales and Scotland reporting with country-specific estimates.
  - Major changes: land classes subdivided into country-unit versions; class aggregation where needed; additional squares to ensure representation of new classes.
  - Upland module added to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - Summary: total GB sampling expanded to support country-level estimates; 40 strata created; added Welsh representation (and adjusted for other countries accordingly).
  - Outputs: detailed country-based land-class maps and country-level habitat estimates; extensive table of squares and sampling rates by class.

- CS2007 (Welsh-focused refinements)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements driven devolution and policy needs.
  - Wales subdivided into five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Wales received 43 extra squares to ensure adequate Welsh representation; minimum six squares per Welsh class.
  - England retained most classes but some classes in England were reduced to four squares per class.
  - Outputs: revised England-with-Wales and Scotland land-class maps; Wales-focused reporting capabilities for 2007 survey results.

## How the outputs were used

- National and country-level habitat estimates
  - Use mean habitat area per square within each Land Class, multiplied by the area of that class.
  - Produce time-series comparisons for habitat change and policy-relevant indicators.
- Policy and reporting alignment
  - Outputs supported devolution-era reporting needs (England, Wales, Scotland) and Wales-only habitat status requirements.
  - Linked to national reports such as Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007 and related CEH/NERC publications.

## Notable challenges and considerations

- Data coverage and representativeness
  - Early reliance on center squares required additional surrounding squares to ensure coverage.
  - As classifications expanded and moved toward country-specific reporting, representation across new or subdivided classes required additional sampling.
- Consistency of national estimates
  - Changing the underlying Land Classification affects cross-time comparability of national estimates.
  - Preference in CS2006/CS2007 to use the latest country-specific classification for consistency with current reporting, while noting potential cross-survey comparability issues.
