# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose: Document the sampling framework and its evolution for the Countryside Survey field surveys, showing how the ITE Land Classification has been developed and applied to produce representative, country-specific environmental estimates across Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) and the Isle of Man up to 2007.
- Context: The methodology is tightly linked to prior and ongoing time-series data; the sampling framework is designed to be representative, allow change detection, and support national and country-level reporting.

## Core concepts and approach

- ITE Land Classification: A stratification system derived from environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to partition land into discrete classes (land classes) for sampling.
- Stratified, random sampling: To minimize bias, samples are drawn within and across land classes; multiple layers of stratification reflect ecological variation beyond simple geographic area.
- Center-square approach (historical): Early work classified the centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid, then added surrounding squares to classify, enabling a national stratification for field surveys.
- Time-series linkage: The sampling framework is built to align with and extend successive surveys (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007), preserving the ability to detect change while accommodating new reporting needs.

## Development timeline and key milestones

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and first field survey
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to define 32 land classes from environmental variables across 1 km squares.
  - 1228 centre squares classified, with 4 surrounding squares assigned to classes, yielding 6039 km squares total.
  - Sampling: 8 squares per land class (total 256) surveyed in summer 1977/1978.
  - National estimates computed as mean habitat area per square within each class, scaled by class land area.

- 1984 – Second field survey
  - Sampling expanded to 12 km squares per land class (total 384).
  - National estimates continued to be based on the 1978 Land Classification framework.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every 1 km square in GB; urban and sea corrections added.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of the 1984 vegetation quadrats; added Land Cover Map context.
  - Classification system updated, with some squares reclassified; overall intent to provide regional/local estimates using a more complete GB-wide classification.
  - Result: Conservation of continuity with earlier surveys while enabling broader estimations.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification for CS1990 framework (leading to CS2000)
  - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; introduced separate reporting for Scotland.
  - Aimed to improve representativeness and enable more robust national estimates at regional scales.
  - Output section began to accommodate country-specific reporting and increased class granularity.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey CS2000 changes
  - Separate country estimates formalized (England with Wales; Scotland) within the sampling framework.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating 40 strata) and then aggregated where necessary to ensure adequate representation within each country.
  - Additional sampling: 19 extra squares to ensure representation of new classes; 11 additional squares to maintain balanced sampling between England and Wales; Wales-specific subdivision of Land Class 17 to improve Wales reporting.
  - Isle of Man: replaced two original squares with two new England squares for country-unit reporting.
  - Uplands module: an additional 30 squares placed within upland and marginal upland Land Classes to improve upland habitat estimates for England and Wales.
  - Summary output: CS2000 established a more explicit country-based framework with adjusted strata and enhanced sampling in Wales; added upland focus.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey CS2007 adjustments for Wales reporting
  - Wales-only reporting drive prompted further refinements:
    - Country-unit sub-divisions expanded to five new Welsh-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class) to improve Welsh estimates.
    - England classes 5e and 15e retained only 4 squares per class due to prior scoping outcomes; precision deemed acceptable for reporting.
  - Outputs: Revised class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland; England/Wales/Scotland sample square distributions updated (Figures 6 and 7 in the document).
  - Table 3 provides detailed counts of squares by class and country, with England and Wales having explicit country-based counts and sampling rates; overall England, Scotland, and Wales sample configurations finalized for 2007.

## Structure and representation of data

- Land Classes and strata: The Land Classification system has evolved from 32 to 40, and then to 45 strata to support country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and, for Wales, additional sub-classes.
- Sample squares: The number and distribution of sample squares per class and per country have been adjusted across CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 to ensure adequate representation, especially for Wales and upland habitats.
- National estimates: Creation of national estimates is influenced by the chosen land classification; changes to classification can affect cross-survey comparability, hence the emphasis on country-unit classifications for consistency.

## Data governance and analytical implications

- Note on national estimates: Changing the basic Land Classification used for national estimates can affect the consistency of stock estimates; for internal consistency, the latest country-specific classification is preferred, though the original approach can provide cross-survey consistency.
- Country-specific reporting: The evolution toward England with Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only sub-classes ensures reporting aligns with policy needs and legislative requirements for each country.
- Data management considerations for data stewards:
  - Documentation and metadata must capture the exact Land Classification version used for each survey and country estimate.
  - Updates to the Land Classification require careful harmonization to maintain comparability across time.
  - Clear provenance is needed to document changes in sampling frames, class definitions, and country-unit allocations.
