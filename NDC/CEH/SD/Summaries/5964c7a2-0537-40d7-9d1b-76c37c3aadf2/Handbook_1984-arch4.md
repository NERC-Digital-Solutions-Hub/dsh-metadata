# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Purpose and scope
  - A field guide for a multi-year ecological survey (Project 424) to establish a quality baseline of land use, land cover, and habitat across Great Britain.
  - Built to compare current conditions with prior surveys (notably 1977/78) and to monitor changes through ground survey and aerial photography.
  - Sampling plan: 384 grid squares (12 per each of 32 land classes) surveyed across GB in 1984, using 1 x 1 km grid cells; data designed to be compatible with previous surveys and useful for landscape-scale objectives.

- Data collection framework
  - Data are captured by annotating 6" (1:10,000) maps with standardized data codes onto a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) per square.
  - Coverage spans multiple domains critical to data leaders: Ownership, Farmer/Landowner information, Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Forestry/Woodland/Trees, Boundaries, Recreation, Buildings/Structures/Communications, plus photography.
  - Data are organized to enable integrated analysis of the whole data system rather than siloed datasets.

- Data standards and coding
  - A comprehensive, predefined coding scheme is used to describe landscape units, vegetation, soils, features, and human use. Codes are numeric with alpha components to merge related categories.
  - Examples of coding logic:
    - Boundary and feature coding to capture exact boundary type, condition, and gaps.
    - Cover types (e.g., 100–140 range) describing vegetation and land cover, with subcategories for stewardship, disturbance, and usage (e.g., agricultural, moorland, heath, marsh, crops, and urban curtilages).
    - Species lists (e.g., 151–169) and proportional/minimal measures (e.g., 25–50% coverage categories).
    - Age, proportions, and management status for woodlands (e.g., age classes, unmanaged vs planted, natural regeneration, underplanting).
  - The coding system is designed to be machine-readable where possible and to accommodate complex mosaics (e.g., mosaic vegetation units represented as combinations of codes with percentages).
  - The FAB includes explicit instructions for recording, combining codes, and avoiding data loss when space or clarity is a constraint.

- Data governance, permissions, and ownership
  - Prior permissions are required to access all parts of a square; securing goodwill from landowners is essential to avoid wasted effort if access is refused mid-survey.
  - Documentation includes Ownership sheets and Farmer/Landowner information to capture ownership status, tenancy, and cooperation levels (0–3 scale for cooperativeness).
  - Surveyors carry identity credentials (ITE ID) and should have a farmer interview approach that is minimally intrusive; background ownership data are to be updated for future surveys.
  - A known-contact list from the prior survey is provided to help locate ownership information and facilitate future rounds.

- Data capture process and workflow
  - Planning and logistics
    - Six ITE research stations organize teams; each square typically takes one survey day, with several planning options (e.g., day-trip, overnight, or multi-square blocks).
    - Travel efficiency is prioritized to avoid duplicative trips; schedules account for accessibility and potential days lost to permissions.
  - Field procedures
    - On-site reconnaissance, permissions, route planning, complete coverage, and post-survey checks for omissions.
    - Equipment is minimal and map-centric; standard field gear and FAB recording tools are used.
  - Data recording and mapping
    - Data are annotated on 6" maps with numeric codes, using a multi-code system to reflect complex land cover or habitat mosaics.
    - Smallest observable unit is roughly half a hectare, with lengths and boundaries marked clearly; axes and boundary types are documented where relevant.
  - Documentation and quality control
    - The FAB is the central recording tool; series number, location, ownership, and interviewer notes are consistently captured.
    - Clear guidance on color coding for clarity, with the option to use colored pens for dense classifications.
  - Post-survey procedures
    - Check for omissions; avoid unnecessary transcription to new maps unless required; report batches to Merlewood as they are completed.

- Data items and content highlights
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed codes for cliffs, rock outcrops, peat, erosion, springs, drainage, lakes, ponds, rivers, canals, shorelines, and related features.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: extensive cover-type categories (e.g., permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, marsh, aquatic vegetation, crops, fallow, abandoned land) with subcodes for species composition, crop status, and related land uses.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: woodland types, tree/stand descriptions (scattered trees, coppice, plantations), age classes, species, regeneration, and management status.
  - Boundaries and recreation: boundary types, descriptions, gaps, and boundary management; formal and informal recreational use areas.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications and Transport: built-cover types, garden/curtilage classifications, road/track/footpath networks, and infrastructure details; color conventions suggested for quick interpretation.
  - Photography: standardized photography protocol (five slides per square) with exact geolocation and view direction notes.

- Data quality, constraints, and reuse
  - Emphasis on field-identified decisions to ensure timely, coherent data entry; avoid deferring decisions to later processing.
  - The dataset is designed to be comparable with historical surveys, enabling trend analysis and larger-scale ecological assessments.
  - The approach supports collaboration and cross-reference with a wider data community to strengthen a system-wide understanding of rural environments.

- Output, impact, and alignment with data leadership goals
  - Delivers a structured, reproducible data framework for assessing rural environmental changes over time.
  - Establishes a scalable baseline dataset with standardized metadata, enabling discoverability, integration with other data sources, and future data-sharing opportunities.
  - Demonstrates an end-to-end data lifecycle: planning, collection, coding, validation, storage, and communication with a central coordination point (Merlewood) for ongoing projects.

- Appendices and operational notes
  - Detailed figure references (grid layout, FAB structure, and color conventions) support consistent fieldwork execution.
  - The handbook provides a concrete methodology for linking field observations to map-based data, and for documenting site-specific context and potential changes.
