# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Aims and context
  - 1984 field handbook for the Rural Environment survey, building on Project 424 (Ecological Survey of Great Britain) initiated in 1976.
  - Purpose: define guidelines for visiting 1 km grid squares, recording land cover/use, habitat features, and related landscape data to establish a quality baseline for future change assessment (ground survey vs aerial photography).
  - Survey design: 384 squares chosen to represent 32 land classes (12 per class); goal to increase statistical confidence and allow partial replacement sampling in the future.

- Data collection framework
  - Data items cover land cover, land use, habitat features, landscape context, and related categories across multiple domains.
  - Main deliverables per square: map-annotated data on 6" (1:10,000) maps and a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB).
  - Organization: data items arranged to be compatible with prior surveys and broadly practical for field recording; emphasis on consistent, coded entries to enable cross-square comparisons.

- FAB and data recording
  - FABs are the primary data recording forms; each square’s data are compiled into a booklet alongside the maps.
  - Coding approach: use a structured set of numeric codes with alpha qualifiers to represent multiple attributes per feature (e.g., boundaries encoded as a numeric string with letters indicating combinations).
  - Map encoding: boundaries and features are annotated on the base maps; minimum mappable unit is 0.5 hectare and 0.5 km length, with edge and corner coverage emphasized.
  - Use of color and symbols: colours used to indicate certain categories when coding becomes too complex; emphasis on not over-cluttering maps with arrows by instead writing codes adjacent to features.

- Data items by domain (highlights)
  - Ownership and permissions
    - Record ownership and tenancy; mark cooperative/interest level of owners; obtain permissions prior to surveying all parts of the square.
  - Farmer/Landowner information
    - Collect contextual conversations and background info to accompany data, but do so discreetly.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal
    - Detailed categories for cliffs, rocks, peat, shorelines, rivers, ponds, lakes, wetlands, drainage, and other hydrogeographic features.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation
    - Cover types (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, marsh, crops, fallow, abandoned land, etc.).
    - Species-level codes for common grasses and forbs; density/cover percent qualifiers for mosaics; measurements and height classes where applicable.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees
    - Units of woodland/forests, coppice, scrub, and belts; rules for individual trees vs. groups; recording of age, proportions, species composition, regeneration, and management status.
  - Boundaries
    - Types (e.g., mortared walls, hedges, fences, stone walls) with descriptions and status (stockproof, gaps filled, derelict, etc.); use of codes to describe boundary condition and changes.
  - Recreation
    - Formal and informal recreation areas and signs; recording of land used for recreation separate from other land uses.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications
    - Built cover types, descriptions, and usage codes for buildings (residential, industrial, public services, education, religious, institutional) and associated structures (pylons, roads, pipelines, signs).
    - Transportation and access features (roads, tracks, footpaths, verges), with colour-coding guidelines for curtilage and built environment.
  - Photography
    - Five photographs per square from prescribed viewpoints; precise marking of photo locations and viewing directions on FAB.

- Planning, equipment, and field procedures
  - Team and scheduling
    - Teams drawn from six ITE research stations; each team surveys about 56 squares; liaison roving teams may be assigned.
  - Time and travel considerations
    - Travel time is a major cost; plan to minimize duplicate site visits; cost assumptions guide daily travel-based surveying.
  - Permissions and access
    - Prior permissions essential to avoid wasted fieldwork; keep updated owner/tenant information; surveyors carry ITE identity and a background briefing.
  - Equipment
    - Recording FABs, 6" maps, photos films, coloured pens, maps for site locations, navigation tools, identity cards, clipboards, pencils, weather gear, reference books, camera.
  - Field procedure workflow
    - On arrival: assess access and likely problems; obtain permissions; plan route to cover full square; complete recording and then review for omissions.
    - Data recording: annotate maps with a standardized set of codes; allow for exceptional cases with notes; avoid over-reliance on uncertain interpretations; document recent changes with codes where possible.
  - Post-survey and data handling
    - End-of-day checks to ensure no omissions; avoid transposing data to new maps unless necessary; inform Merlewood (central coordination) when batches are complete and arrange transport of FABs.
    - Emphasis on early availability of outputs to support subsequent analyses and interpretation.

- Data quality, standards, and reuse
  - Standardization is central to enabling cross-square and cross-survey analyses, including comparability with 1977/78 survey data.
  - Flexible yet structured coding approach allows detailed mosaics to be represented without losing comparability.
  - Clear guidelines for when to qualify or note uncertainties, and how to document unusual features or recent changes.

- Summary for data-focused stakeholders
  - The handbook defines a comprehensive, coded data-collection framework for rural environment surveys at 1 km grid squares, with standardized forms (FAB) and a robust field-to-digital workflow.
  - It emphasizes data quality, repeatability, and compatibility with earlier surveys, enabling effective longitudinal analyses and the creation of data products (dashboards, reports) that support broader data-use goals.
  - The documentation provides practical guidance for data curation, including metadata around ownership, permissions, feature classification, and post-survey data verification and submission logistics.
