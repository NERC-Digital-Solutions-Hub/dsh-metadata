# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview and purpose
- Guidelines for a GB-wide field survey (Project 424 Ecological Survey of Great Britain) to record land cover, land use and habitat features on a grid of 1x1 squares.
- Aim to create map-based data suitable for GIS visualisation and to establish a baseline for future comparisons with aerial photography and ground surveys.
- Survey covers 384 squares (12 per each of 32 Land Classes) across Great Britain; minimum mapable unit is about 0.5 hectares with corresponding length constraints.

## Survey framework and sampling
- Land Classes were created from a multivariate classification; subsequent fieldwork samples 32 classes with 12 squares each.
- Squares are divided among six ITS research stations with a roving liaison team; planning emphasizes efficient coverage and travel costs.
- The survey is primarily a mapping and recording exercise, designed to be compatible with previous surveys and scalable for future sampling and partial replacement.

## Planning and logistics
- Each square requires about one day to survey; travel time is a major cost. Prefer travel-based planning (no overnight subsistence where possible).
- Three common planning options:
  - Travel from station for one square per day.
  - One night away for two squares (one on outbound, one on return).
  - A group of squares surveyed over a week with extended stay.
- Access permissions should be obtained before surveying; farmer/landowner cooperation is important for background information and access.

## Equipment and data capture
- Minimal field equipment: recording booklets (FABs), 1:10,000 maps, film, pens, maps to locate sites, navigation aids, ITE ID, clipboards, weather gear, reference books, camera.
- Data capture is designed for coding on maps using a combination of numeric codes and alpha characters to compactly represent multiple attributes per feature.
- Colour conventions are encouraged to simplify map reading and reduce editing errors.

## Field procedure (typical square survey flow)
- On arrival: scan surroundings, identify access issues, and assess potential problems.
- Seek permissions for the entire square before starting.
- Plan a route that covers the square in full and select the best sequence to ensure complete data capture.
- After surveying: review records for omissions and ensure clear, legible presentation.

## Permissions and ownership
- Obtain permission to access all parts of the square and to gather information from landowners.
- Record ownership details for all land units; mark tenants (T) and owners (C) where ownership has changed since 1977/78.
- Note owner/cooperation levels on an ownership sheet to aid future survey planning.

## Data recording and formatting
- Data are recorded on 6" (1:10,000) maps using predefined data codes; combinations of codes are stored in dedicated boxes on each FAB page.
- Map boundaries should be clearly marked; boundary types are coded and described with supporting notes.
- Decisions on recording are made in the field by the surveyor; post-processing should not override field decisions without justification.
- The smallest field unit to be mapped is a defined boundary length; even square edges must be surveyed and coded.

## Field Assessment Booklet (FAB)
- Each square’s data are compiled into a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB), along with the 6" maps.
- FAB sections include: cover, ownership, farmer/landowner information, physiography/inland water/coastal, agriculture/natural vegetation, forestry/woodland/trees, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications, photography, and post-survey procedures.
- Instructions emphasize consistency, use of pencil for erasable records, and where necessary, the use of colour coding to represent complex mosaics or high-detail areas.

## Page-by-page and data definitions (highlights)
- Ownership and Farmer/Landowner information: capture ownership names, tenant status, and interview notes; attach a cooperative rating to owners to guide follow-up surveys.
- Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: document cliffs, rock outcrops, boulders, peat, ground leveling, eroding peat, surface features, coastal features, inland water bodies (lakes, ponds, rivers, canals), drainage, ditches, springs, weirs, and related substrates.
- Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: map cover types (e.g., permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, cereals, fallow, abandoned land, croplands, gardens), and record species when cover exceeds thresholds; include measurements and height classes for selected vegetation types.
- Forestry/Woodland/Trees: record woodland, coppice, scrub, belts, hedgerows, individual trees, and tree regeneration; capture age, proportions, species codes, and management status (unmanaged, natural regeneration, plantation, underplanting, etc.).
- Boundaries: classify boundary types (wall, mortared wall, hedges, fences, stockproof boundaries, gates, gaps filled), with descriptive notes and stockproof status; include boundary descriptors and boundary length in the unit.
- Recreation: log formal and informal recreation uses (parks, golf courses, school grounds, playgrounds, access points, etc.).
- Buildings/Structures/Communications: map built features and infrastructure including residential, commercial, industrial, public services, education/cultural, religious, institutional buildings, and associated grounds; record roads, tracks, footpaths, and other transport-related features.
- Colour coding: practical guidance for map colouring to distinguish different land uses and features (e.g., residential buildings in yellow, agricultural curtilage in green, roads in red, etc.).

## Photography and reporting after fieldwork
- Take five photographs per square using slide film to reflect key features and the surrounding landscape; specify exact map locations and directions of each view on the FAB.
- After surveying, perform a quality check of the FAB and maps; avoid transposing data to new maps unless absolutely necessary due to damage to the original materials.
- Coordinate with Merlewood for batch submission of completed FABs and transport of completed data sheets.

## Post-survey: data handling and objectives
- Data should be shared promptly with Merlewood; batches processed and submitted efficiently to avoid data loss.
- The handbook’s data framework enables cross-comparison with aerial photography (ITE 899) and helps establish a baseline for future ecological monitoring of land use, habitats, and landscape change.

## Key takeaways for GIS-focused use
- The handbook provides a comprehensive, codes-based geospatial data model designed for 1:10,000 map-based field recording across GB.
- It specifies a repeatable sampling scheme (384 squares across 32 land classes) to facilitate temporal comparisons.
- Data capture is designed for integration with GIS workflows, including standardized categories (cover types, habitat features, boundaries, vegetation, and built infrastructure) and a structured FAB data sheet approach.
- Emphasis on data quality, field-based decision-making, and clear documentation of permissions, ownership, and interview context to support robust spatial analyses.
