# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview
- Context: builds on 1976 Project 424 Ecological Survey of Great Britain; uses a multivariate Land Classes framework to sample. 
- Objective: establish a quality baseline to monitor changes in habitats and land use over time, using ground surveys and aerial photography. 
- Design: survey 384 squares (12 from each of 32 land classes) across Great Britain in 1984, with some exceptions where the original square could not be surveyed.
- Data goal: collect land cover, land use, habitat features, and related landscape data to support practical assessments and future partial replacement sampling; ensure statistical confidence and comparability with past surveys.

## Sampling Design and Scope
- Grid: 1 km x 1 km squares; 32 land classes; 12 squares per class (384 total).
- Sampling intent: ground-based verification of land cover, land use, and habitat features; maintain compatibility with previous surveys.
- Re-survey plan: revisit original sites to assess changes; supplement with additional squares from each class to strengthen statistical power.
- Practical constraints: planning emphasizes travel efficiency and avoiding double visits; multiple planning options exist for sequencing and lodging.

## Data Collection Methods and Tools
- Field Instrument: Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and 6" (1:10,000) maps; data are recorded using structured codes and combinations of numeric codes represented by alpha characters to streamline recording.
- Data items: organized into sheets corresponding to key landscape components (Ownership, Farmer/Landowner Information, Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Forestry/Woodland/Trees, Boundaries, Recreation, Buildings/Structures/Communications, Photography).
- Coding approach: numeric codes are combined to form concise, expandable codes for map features; the same code can describe multiple attributes of a feature (e.g., boundary type, hedge condition, etc.).
- Mapping conventions: boundaries and features are clearly marked on the 1:10,000 maps; minimum mappable unit is 1/2 hectare with lengths of 1/5 km; ensure edge corners of squares are captured.
- Colour conventions: specific colors are recommended to distinguish categories (e.g., residential buildings, curtilages, roads, etc.) to reduce legend clutter.
- Data integrity: field decisions should be made in situ; if a feature is unclear, note or qualify rather than delaying data entry.

## FAB Structure and Data Sheets
- FAB contents: each square’s data are compiled into an Assessment Booklet (FAB) with a fixed sequence but not strictly prescriptive in order.
- Key sections:
  - Cover: series number, location, and other identifying fields.
  - Ownership: identify owners and tenants; rate owner/cooperativeness for future access.
  - Farmer/Landowner Information: contextual background from conversations; not a formal questionnaire.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed physiographic and inland/coastal features with coded categories.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: ground cover types, crops, pasture, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, and related measurements; includes notes on curtilages and built-up areas.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: tree and woodland categories, density, age, regeneration, planting, underplanting, belts, hedges, and crop associations.
  - Boundaries: boundary types, descriptions, and changes; stockproof vs non-stockproof distinctions; notes on gaps and boundary conditions.
  - Recreation: formal and informal recreational uses mapped and coded.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, uses, descriptions, and related infrastructure (roads, tracks, footpaths, rails, barriers, pipelines, signs, etc.).
  - Photography: five photographs per square with precise site and direction notes; map locations of photos.
  - Colour and recording notes: guidance for avoiding clutter and recording complex mosaics.
- Data examples: extensive, including specific species lists (e.g., grasses, herbs, and woody species) and a broad range of land-use codes (agricultural, pastoral, urban curtilages, etc.).

## Physiography and Intra-land Features
- Physiography: detailed categories for cliffs, rock outcrops, boulders, peat, ground leveling, erosion, and coastal/inland water features (lakes, ponds, rivers, canals, springs, ditches, levees).
- Coastal and inland water attributes: shore types, sediments, river/stream classifications, drainage signs, and substrate descriptions.
- Coding framework: numeric codes (and combinations) to capture multi-feature descriptions (e.g., shore type with substrate and vegetation).

## Agriculture, Natural Vegetation, and Habitat Types
- Cover types: broad categories for grasslands, moorlands, heath, bogs, marshes, aquatic vegetation, crops, fallow/abandoned land, and urban-associated curtilages.
- Crops and stock: detailed crop types (e.g., cereals, root crops, vegetables) and livestock presence, stock type, and dual-use categories.
- Vegetation structure: density, height classes, and age/valor indicators (e.g., age classes for trees and regeneration status).
- Special notes: emphasis on curtilages (e.g., residential gardens) and avoiding over-mapping in urban contexts beyond defined curtilage areas.

## Forestry, Woodland, and Trees
- Woodlands and tree types: classification for woodland vs. coppice, belts, hedgerows, individual trees, and regeneration.
- Density and structure: crown cover thresholds, height, diameter, and age classes; guidelines for when to subdivide into blocks.
- Species lists: standardized species codes for principal taxa; use of cover percentages to describe mixture.
- Management signals: unmanaged, natural regeneration, underplanting, planting, and re-growth from stumps descriptions.
- Special features: hedges, belts, and tree-structure descriptions (e.g., coppice stool, shelter belts).

## Boundaries
- Types and descriptions: mortared wall, hedges, fences, stockproof boundaries, walls, gates, and transitional types.
- Recording guidance: length and condition notes; filled gaps and boundary integrity codes; emphasis on accurate delimitation between land-use categories.

## Recreation
- Use types: formal recreational spaces and information/trail uses; informal play areas and school playgrounds; golf courses; race tracks; boats and boating facilities; nature-related recreation points.

## Buildings, Structures, and Communications
- Built cover types: residential, commercial, industrial, public services, educational/cultural, religious, institutional, and new developments.
- Descriptions and usage: specific use codes to describe building functions; areas around gardens/grounds and curtilages mapped with descriptive detail.
- Infrastructure: roads, tracks, footpaths, rails, embankments, bridges, tunnels, pylons, barriers, and other transport-related features; color guidance for map readability.

## Photography
- Protocol: five photographs per square, with precise location and directional notes to accompany the FAB; minimize including excessive sky or surroundings.

## Procedure Subsequent to Survey
- QA and data handling: review completed FABs for omissions; avoid unnecessary data transposition; batch submission and coordination with Merlewood for transport and processing.
- Data sharing: emphasis on keeping track of sources and preparing data for potential sharing or integration with portals and metadata systems.

## Practical Considerations for Analysts
- Data provenance and standardization: the handbook provides a comprehensive, codified framework designed for repeatability across time and space, enabling robust comparisons and modeling.
- Local access and permissions: explicit focus on gaining permissions and maintaining goodwill with landowners to reduce data gaps.
- Data at appropriate scale: designed to capture land-class-level patterns while allowing local detail via coded field observations.
- Handling complexity: field mosaics and dense feature interactions documented via coded combinations and color conventions to reduce mapping clutter.

## Key Takeaways for Data-Driven Analysis
- A rigorous, codified field data framework was established to enable consistent, scalable analysis of rural land use, vegetation, and landscape change over time.
- The approach emphasizes reproducibility, metadata awareness, and explicit data provenance, facilitating correlation analysis, trend detection, and predictive modeling tied to land-class and square-based sampling.
