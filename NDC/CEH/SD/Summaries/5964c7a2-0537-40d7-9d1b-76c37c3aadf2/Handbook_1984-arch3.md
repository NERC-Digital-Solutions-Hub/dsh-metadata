# 1984 May CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIROMMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview
- Describes guidelines for a field survey of Great Britain’s rural environment as part of Project 424 Ecological Survey.
- Aims to establish a quality baseline for monitoring environmental change, comparing ground survey with aerial photography, and to guide future decision-making.
- Sampling design expanded from earlier work: 384 squares across GB (12 per each of 32 land classes), building on the 1977/78 survey to increase statistical confidence and allow partial replacement sampling.

## What data are collected and how
- Core data domains mapped and recorded on 1:10,000 maps using a standardized FAB (Field Assessment Booklet):
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees
  - Boundaries
  - Recreation
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications
  - Ownership/Farmer/Landowner information
  - Photography (5 photos per square)
- Data items are designed to be compatible with previous surveys and to support grid-based analysis and landscape objectives.
- Coding system:
  - Use numeric and alpha codes to annotate map features, enabling compact, linked records (e.g., combining codes to describe complex units).
  - Categories include detailed cover types, species lists, land use, boundary types, boundary descriptions, and structural features.
- Coverage and granularity:
  - Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectare; minimum length: 0.2 km (approximate).
  - Edge of squares should be fully recorded; all small features documented with consistent coding.
- Taxa and features:
  - Extensive species coding for major flora and fauna, including grasses, herbs, and trees.
  - Land cover/use classifications span agrarian, moorland, woodland, aquatic habitats, and urban-adjacent curtilages.
  - Detailed categories for boundaries, hedgerows, walls, stockproofing, and man-made features.

## Field methodology and planning
- Planning structure:
  - Squares divided into seven groups; teams from six ITE research stations plus liaison teams.
  - Each square planned to take a day to survey; travel time emphasized to minimize overtime and avoid double visits.
  - Flexible options for field stays away from home to cover multiple squares (1 night to multiday arrangements).
- Equipment:
  - Minimal: FABs, 1:10,000 maps, film, cameras, pens, clipboards, weather gear, reference books, etc.
- Field procedures:
  - Upon arrival: assess access and permissions, choose a route that ensures full square coverage.
  - Seek permissions before surveying; document and manage access background information.
  - After surveying: review data for omissions, ensure clear presentation, and allow time for quality checks.

## Permissions and stakeholder engagement
- Permissions are essential to access all parts of each square and to maintain goodwill with landowners/farmers.
- Use owner/landowner information to build rapport; aim to interview at least one farmer per square (preferably the principal landowner).
- Maintain a list of known owners and update ownership records; carry identity, preferably ITE ID.

## Data recording and the FAB
- Data recording approach:
  - Annotate 6" (1:10,000) maps with coded information; use a structured FAB to organize data by square.
  - Use combinations of data codes to capture multi-item features; preserve the ability to decode codes later.
  - When complexity arises, switch to color coding to differentiate categories, ensuring legibility and avoiding over-cluttering.
- FAB structure (sample sections):
  - Cover (completion of all sections)
  - Ownership
  - Farmer/Landowner Information
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees
  - Boundaries
  - Recreation
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications
  - Photography
- Detailed field instructions:
  - Record ownership with codes for land units and tenants/owners; mark coop/interest levels to gauge follow-up potential.
  - Physiography and coastal/inland water categories have explicit notes (e.g., cliff heights, peat types, river classifications, springs, ditches, and levees).
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation sheet includes extensive cover-type categories (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, various heath and aquatic habitats, crops, fallow/abandoned land, and age-related or production codes for trees and crops).
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees sheet covers woodlands, coppice, scrub, belts, hedgerows, individual trees, and age/stock/management codes; provides guidance on when to apply species, proportions, and age classes.
  - Boundaries sheet details boundary types, descriptions, and presence of gaps or repairs.
  - Recreation sheet catalogs formal and informal recreational uses.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications sheet maps built cover types, descriptions, uses, and color conventions; includes roads, tracks, footpaths, barriers, and infrastructure (pipes, pylons, signs, etc.).
- Photography guidelines:
  - Take five slides per square, with careful marking of exact photo locations and directions on the FAB.

## Output, governance, and dissemination
- Data quality and governance:
  - Emphasis on open data where feasible; underlying data should be shared appropriately.
  - Establish data management standards and metadata to enable verification and reuse.
  - Clear instructions for data cleaning, transformation, and final presentation to support reports, charts, and dashboards.
- Dissemination and stakeholder engagement:
  - Outputs should be disseminated to stakeholders; data shared publicly where appropriate.
  - Data governance processes implemented to ensure datasets meet standards and remain up to date.

## End-of-survey procedures and logistics
- After fieldwork:
  - Conduct thorough QA to ensure no omissions; avoid unnecessary transcription where possible.
  - Coordinate with Merlewood on batch completion and arrange transport of FAB squares.
  - Communicate findings and batch status to the relevant teams.

## Key considerations and challenges
- Anticipated barriers:
  - Data gaps or data access limitations; organizational silos; difficulties sharing datasets publicly due to metadata or governance issues.
  - The need for robust metadata to enable verification of data suitability.
  - The effort required to transform data into usable formats for analysis and dissemination.
- Relationship to monitoring framework aims:
  - Defines a standardized, repeatable data collection framework to support environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
  - Balances practicality with methodological consistency to enable temporal comparisons and assessments of change.
  - Emphasizes stakeholder engagement and data governance as core components of an effective monitoring program.
