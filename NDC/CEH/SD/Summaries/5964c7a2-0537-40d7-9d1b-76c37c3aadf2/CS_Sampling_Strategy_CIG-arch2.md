# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Purpose and overall approach

- A long-running, data-driven framework to monitor the British countryside via standardized sampling and land classification.
- Aims to provide consistent, time-series outputs on environmental health and habitat change using stratified, random field sampling.
- Emphasizes transforming and quality-assuring data from established sources into outputs (habitat estimates, maps, tables) while ensuring datasets are stored and accessible.

## Core concept: stratification and the ITE Land Classification

- Stratified sampling is used to ensure representative coverage across diverse land types and environmental conditions.
- The ITE Land Classification divides Great Britain into land classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.), enabling efficient, comparable sampling across time.
- Early work started with a centre-square approach (a 15 × 15 km grid) to classify 1 km squares, then expanded to classify surrounding areas and, later, all squares using surrogates for climate and physiography as computing power grew.

## Chronology of developments

- 1978 (CS1978) – First Land Classification and field survey:
  - 32 Land Classes generated from 1,228 centre squares; four surrounding squares classified per centre square.
  - 6039 km squares classified; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class).
  - National habitat estimates derived as: mean habitat area per square in a class × area of that class.

- 1984 (CS1984) – Second field survey:
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (total 384); eight squares per class retained for continuity.
  - Emphasis on land use and habitat mapping rather than soils and species.

- 1990 (CS1990) – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey:
  - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
  - First integration with a Land Cover Map derived from satellite imagery.
  - All previously recorded features repeated; urban/sea corrections included.

- 1998 (CS1998/CS2000 framework) – Revised Land Classification and separate country reporting:
  - Land Classes expanded to 40; Scotland reporting separated from England and Wales.
  - Population of squares adjusted to support country-specific estimates (England, Wales, Scotland).

- 2000 (CS2000) – Expanded country-specific sampling and upland focus:
  - Introduction of country-unit estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland) using country-specific classes.
  - Class subdivisions and aggregations created 40 strata; 19 additional squares added to ensure adequate representation, plus adjustments to maintain sampling balance between England and Wales.
  - Upland habitat module added (30 extra squares) to improve upland estimates in England and Wales.

- 2007 (CS2007) – Wales-only reporting and further refinement:
  - Wales required more robust Wales-only estimates; Welsh classes subdivided into 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w, increasing strata to 45.
  - Additional Welsh squares (43) added; minimum 6 squares per Welsh class; some English classes reduced (e.g., 5e, 15e) due to representation needs.
  - England did not receive additional squares to compensate; precision considerations noted.

## Country-specific estimates and notes

- Separate country estimates introduced to better support policy and legislation needs for England, Wales, and Scotland.
- Class sub-division and aggregation used to maintain adequate representation within each country unit.
- The note on national estimates highlights that changing the underlying Land Classification affects the consistency of stock estimates; the preferred approach is to use the latest classification for internal survey consistency while considering comparability across surveys.

## Uplands and additional modules

- The uplands module (CS2000) added 30 squares in upland/marginal areas to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- These additions aimed to ensure reliable country-specific upland estimates alongside the broader habitat dataset.

## Outputs, formats, and accessibility

- Outputs include habitat status, change information, and related statistics presented as reports, maps, and tables.
- The framework emphasizes standardized formats to support cross-time comparisons and policy assessments.
- Datasets are intended to be stored and accessible via appropriate portals, aligning with the aim of enabling broad data reuse.

## Practical implications for environmental analysts

- Time-series integrity depends on consistent stratification and classification decisions; shifts in Land Classification can affect long-term comparability.
- The methodology supports country-specific environmental policy needs (England & Wales, Scotland; later Wales-only reporting), useful for regional policy evaluation.
- The progressively refined sampling framework enhances precision for targeted regions (notably Wales and uplands) while balancing overall representation across Great Britain.
- Opportunities exist to increase data value by integrating Countryside Survey data with other relevant environmental datasets and by ensuring broad access to underlying data.
