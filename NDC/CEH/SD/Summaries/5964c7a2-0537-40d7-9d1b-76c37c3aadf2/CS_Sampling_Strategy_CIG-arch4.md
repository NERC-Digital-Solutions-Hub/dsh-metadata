# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the sampling strategy for the Countryside Survey field survey element up to 2007.
  - The methodology is the latest in a 30-year evolution of the ITE Land Classification, starting in 1978.
  - Understanding prior developments is essential because the current framework is tightly linked to its predecessors.

- Core concept: stratified ecological sampling
  - Emphasizes stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure samples are representative of the landscape.
  - Stratification (via the ITE Land Classification) carves GB into discrete land classes, capturing ecological and land-use variability across regions.

- Origin of the ITE Land Classification
  - Built from early work by Bunce and Shaw using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on vegetation quadrats, then scaled to landscape level with environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate).
  - The initial approach classified 1 km squares into 32 land classes (1978), with surrounding squares assigned via the ISA key.

- Sampling framework across the surveys (progression and key changes)
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - Unit: 1 km squares; 8 samples per land class; total 256 squares.
    - Output: national habitat area estimates based on mean habitat area per square within each land class multiplied by land-class area.
  - CS1984 (Second land-use survey)
    - Sample size increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification)
    - Expanded to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Continued use of the existing land-class framework for national estimates, with data consolidation including the first linkage to the Land Cover Map from satellite data.
  - CS2000 (Revised Land Classification)
    - Extended classification to enable separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland).
    - 40 strata; added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation; introduced country-unit sub-division and reallocation of some squares to maintain representation.
    - Included an uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
  - CS2007 (Further refinement for Wales-only reporting)
    - Wales-specific reporting drove further adjustments:
      - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions (creating five new Welsh/England-specific classes).
      - Increased total strata to 45.
      - Added 43 Welsh squares to meet representation requirements; two Welsh classes left with only 6 squares, with justification that precision loss was acceptable for reporting purposes.
    - England adjustments: no additional Welsh squares added beyond those allocated; some English classes remained with fewer squares but deemed acceptable for reporting.

- Country reporting and upland focus
  - Separate country estimates introduced to support England with Wales, and Scotland-specific reporting.
  - Land Classes subdivided by country units; where necessary, small rump classes were aggregated with similar classes within the country.
  - An uplands module (additional 30 squares) funded to improve accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Data outputs and estimation approach
  - National estimates derived by combining class-level statistics with class-area data.
  - Tables and maps show the distribution of sample squares across Land Classes and across England, Scotland, and Wales.
  - The document provides detailed counts of squares per class for each survey, alongside sampling rates (1:x) and stratum areas.
  - Total sampling scale:
    - GB totals: CS2000 used 569 sample squares; CS2007 used 591 sample squares (England, Wales, Scotland combined).
    - Land Class framework evolved from 32 classes (1978) to 40 (1990) to 45 (2007), with Wales-specific subdivisions increasing granularity for country-specific reporting.
