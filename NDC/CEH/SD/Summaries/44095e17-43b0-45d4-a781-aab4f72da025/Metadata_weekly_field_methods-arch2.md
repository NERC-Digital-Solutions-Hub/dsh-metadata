## How this aligns with the Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype

- Uses standardized data collection methods and defined devices across multiple environmental media (rainfall, cloud, surface water, groundwater, throughfall, stemflow) to enable consistent, comparable outputs.
- Documents data quality aspects through explicit sampling intervals, field measurements, and laboratory filtration steps, supporting verification, cleaning, and transformation.
- Structured results likely to be produced as datasets, maps, and charts, with datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for accessibility and reuse.

## Particular Challenges and Opportunities

- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating them with other relevant data sources beyond single-use applications.
- Ensuring access to underlying data used to create final outputs, including comprehensive metadata and portal availability to facilitate reuse by others.
