# Three decades of water quality measurements from the Upper Severn experimental catchments at Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource for research, modelling, environmental management and education

## Overview
- Data are publicly available for education and research; Centre for Ecology and Hydrology retains copyright.
- Users should cite Neal et al. (2011) and other relevant papers by the authors as appropriate.

## Licensing, disclaimers, and liability
- Data provided "as is" with no guarantee of freedom from errors or omissions.
- Users assume all risk and are responsible for suitability for their purpose.
- Authors and employers provide no warranty and assume no liability for accuracy, completeness, or usefulness.
- No assurance that use would not infringe private rights.

## Data structure, raw vs edited data
- Raw Data Archive (RDA) is the end-of-variable tag for raw lab-reported measurements.
- Raw data have not been altered except for correcting traceable transcription errors.
- Raw archive is provided for completeness and transparency about subsequent data editing.
- The archive enables revisiting original data if new information suggests important phenomena may have been edited out.
- Not recommended for routine analyses because raw data may contain substantial errors.
- Routine analyses should use the edited data, where problematic values have been corrected or excluded.
- Differences between edited and raw data are detailed in the accompanying file: "Plynlimon weekly data editing documentation.pdf".

## Access, usage guidance, and citations
- When publishing, cite the primary 2011 Hydrological Processes paper and consider citing other papers by the authors as appropriate to the study topic.

## Data governance and stewardship implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates robust provenance, with clear documentation of edits and an accessible raw+edited data framework.
- Highlights the importance of metadata, transparency about data editing, and explicit guidance on data quality.
- Illustrates how to balance raw data availability with edited data for reliable analyses.

## Practical considerations for implementation
- Use edited data for routine analyses; refer to editing documentation for understanding changes.
- Acknowledge and cite the data appropriately in reports and publications.
- Be mindful of data gaps, potential errors in raw measurements, and the need to keep metadata up to date.
- Consider aligning with broader data communities and ensuring discoverability and clear versioning of the dataset.
