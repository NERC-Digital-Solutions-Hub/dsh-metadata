# Three decades of water quality measurements from the Upper Severn experimental catchments at Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource for research, modelling, environmental management and education

## Overview
- Public data release for education and research; Centre for Ecology and Hydrology retains copyright.
- For published work, users should cite: Neal, C. et al., Three decades of water quality measurements from the Upper Severn experimental catchments at Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource for research, modelling, environmental management and education, Hydrological Processes, 2011; and cite other papers by the listed authors as relevant.

## Data access, quality, and provenance
- The Raw Data Archive (RDA) contains raw measurements as reported by analytical laboratories; only transcription error corrections traced to original lab files are applied.
- The RDA is provided for completeness and transparency about edits; it allows returning to original data if new information suggests important phenomena may have been edited out.
- The RDA is not recommended for routine analyses because it contains values believed to be substantially in error.
- Routine analyses should use the edited data, where problematic values have been corrected or excluded.
- Differences between edited data and the raw data archive are explained in detail in the accompanying file: “Plynlimon weekly data editing documentation.pdf”.

## Data editing and documentation
- The dataset has undergone quality assurance and data cleaning to produce the edited (analytic) data.
- The accompanying editing documentation explains how and why data values were corrected or removed, enabling traceability.

## Rights, warranties, and responsibilities
- Data are provided “as is” with no guarantees of error-free content.
- Users assume all risk and are responsible for determining suitability for their purposes.
- No warranties or liability are provided by the authors or their employers regarding accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of the data.

## Practical guidance for GIS and map-making
- Prefer edited data for map-based analyses and visualization to ensure reliability.
- Document data provenance and edit history when creating map products.
- Use the raw data archive only for traceability or special investigations, with clear disclaimers in any outputs.
- Reference the editing documentation when explaining data quality and processing steps in GIS-derived outputs.

## Key references and attribution
- Primary citation: Neal et al. 2011, Hydrological Processes.
- Additional citations to other relevant papers by the listed authors may be appropriate depending on study topics.
