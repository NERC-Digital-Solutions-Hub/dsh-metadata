Three decades of water quality measurements from the Upper Severn experimental catchments at Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource for research, modelling, environmental management and education

## Overview
- Publicly available data for use in education and research; copyright retained by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).
- Users publishing work based on these data should cite the primary paper and related works by the listed authors as appropriate.

## Citation and attribution
- Primary citation to include: Neal, C., et al. Three decades of water quality measurements from the Upper Severn experimental catchments at Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource for research, modelling, environmental management and education, Hydrological Processes, 25, 3818-3830, 2011 (doi: 10.1002/hyp.8191).
- Users should also cite other relevant papers by the same authors where appropriate to the study topic.

## Disclaimers and risk
- Data are provided “as is” with no guarantee of absence of errors or omissions.
- Users assume all risk and are responsible for assessing suitability for any purpose.
- Authors and employers disavow warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose and any liability for inaccuracies or infringement.

## Data provenance and access
- The Raw Data Archive (RDA) contains unaltered raw measurements reported by analytical laboratories.
- RDA has not been edited except to correct transcription errors traceable to original lab files; aims for transparency concerning subsequent data editing.
- The RDA allows re-checking original values if new information arises, but is not recommended for routine analyses.

## Data quality and usage guidance
- Routine analyses should use the edited dataset, where problematic values have been corrected or excluded where possible.
- The edited versus raw data differences are detailed in accompanying documentation to ensure traceability.

## Documentation and data governance
- Differences between edited data and the raw archive are explained in the file "Plynlimon weekly data editing documentation.pdf."
- The data package emphasizes transparency in data editing and provides needed documentation to support reproducibility and auditing.
