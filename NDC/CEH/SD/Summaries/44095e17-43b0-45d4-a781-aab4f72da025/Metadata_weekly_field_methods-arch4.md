# SAMPLING

- Purpose and scope: A metadata snapshot of environmental sampling across multiple media, detailing how data were collected, measured, and processed over time to support analysis of rainfall, cloud, stream water, groundwater, throughfall, and stemflow.

- Datasets and key attributes:
  - Rainfall
    - Collection methods/devices: Bulk samples; continuously open Warren Spring pattern collector; additional flow/volume via Tanllwyth met site ground level raingauge
    - Field measurements: Air temperature (glass thermometer and thermistor)
    - Sampling interval: Weekly/daily
    - Timeframe: 10 May 1983 to 18 May 1999
    - Filtration: Lab
  - Cloud
    - Collection methods/devices: Bulk samples; CEH Edinburgh pattern lidded harp type passive collector
    - Flow/volume: Weight of sample
    - Field measurements: None
    - Sampling interval: Weekly
    - Timeframe: 25 Sep 1990 to continuous
    - Filtration: Lab
  - Stream water
    - Collection methods/devices: Grab samples; plastic bucket with cord
    - Flow/volume: CEH stream (flume) gauges or nearest flume data
    - Field measurements: Stream temperature; electrical conductivity
    - Sampling interval: Weekly/Daily
    - Timeframe: 10 May 1983 to continuous
    - Filtration: Field
  - Groundwater
    - Collection methods/devices: Grab samples after flushing boreholes; BGS borehole sampler
    - Flow/volume: Dip level recorder (depth referenced to borehole top)
    - Field measurements: Groundwater temperature; electrical conductivity
    - Sampling interval: Monthly/fortnightly/weekly
    - Timeframe: 24 Apr 1994 to 14 Feb 2001
    - Filtration: Field
  - Throughfall
    - Collection methods/devices: Bulk samples; trough collector
    - Flow/volume: Volume of sample
    - Field measurements: None
    - Sampling interval: Fortnightly
    - Timeframe: 6 Feb 1984 to 2 Sep 1991
    - Filtration: Lab
  - Stemflow
    - Collection methods/devices: Bulk samples; plastic tubing around trees with carboy collector
    - Flow/volume: Volume of sample
    - Field measurements: None
    - Sampling interval: Fortnightly
    - Timeframe: 6 Feb 1984 to 2 Sep 1991
    - Filtration: Lab

- Data quality and management implications:
  - Multiple media with different collection devices and methods (field vs lab) require harmonized metadata, units, and provenance for integration.
  - Time series span extensive periods with contiguous and discontinuous intervals (e.g., some datasets continuous, others end in 1991 or 1999, others continue).
  - Measurement types vary (temperature, conductivity, volume) and may rely on different instruments, affecting comparability.

- Gaps and considerations for data leaders:
  - Fragmentation across media and methods; need clear metadata standards to enable discoverability and cross-dataset analyses.
  - Ensure consistent metadata on units, calibration, and data processing (lab vs field filtration) to support reuse.
  - Potential access considerations not specified; dataset appears to be lab-processed with various archival timeframes, highlighting the importance of maintaining updates and documentation for ongoing datasets.
