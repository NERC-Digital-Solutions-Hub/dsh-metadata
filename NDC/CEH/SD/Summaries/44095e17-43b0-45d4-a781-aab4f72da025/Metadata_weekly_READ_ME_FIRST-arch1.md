# Three decades of water quality measurements from the Upper Severn experimental catchments at Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource for research, modelling, environmental management and education

## Overview
- Publicly available data for education and research; copyright held by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).
- For published work, cite the primary paper: Neal et al., 2011, Hydrological Processes, 25:3818-3830, doi:10.1002/hyp.8191; also cite other papers by the listed authors as appropriate.

## Purpose and scope
- An openly accessible data resource designed to support research, modelling, environmental management, and education.
- Data pertain to three decades of water quality measurements from the Upper Severn experimental catchments at Plynlimon, Wales.

## Data access, provenance, and citation
- Data are provided to researchers and educators under clear citation requirements.
- The dataset includes metadata and is intended to facilitate transparency in data use and interpretation.

## Data quality, editing, and documentation
- Important distinction between raw and edited data:
  - Raw Data Archive (RDA) contains unaltered measurements as reported by analytical laboratories, with only transcription corrections made.
  - The raw data archive is provided for completeness and transparency about subsequent data editing.
  - Routine analyses should use the edited data, where problematic values have been corrected or excluded.
  - Differences between edited and raw data are detailed in the accompanying file, "Plynlimon weekly data editing documentation.pdf."

## Warnings and liabilities
- Data are provided "as is" with no guarantees of accuracy or fitness for a particular purpose.
- Users assume all risk and are responsible for assessing suitability of the data for their specific use.
- No warranties or legal liability are provided by the authors or their employers regarding accuracy, completeness, or usefulness, or infringement of rights.

## Practical guidance for analysts
- Use edited data for most analyses; consult the editing documentation to understand corrections.
- If exploring data editing procedures or methodological transparency, consult the raw data alongside the edited dataset.
- Track and cite data sources properly in publications; reference the main 2011 Hydrological Processes paper and relevant works by the authors.

## Accessibility and governance
- Data remain a hosted resource by CEH with copyright retained by CEH.
- Users are encouraged to acknowledge sources and follow citation guidance to support ongoing openness and reuse.
