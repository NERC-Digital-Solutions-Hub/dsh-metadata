- Cross-cutting notes
  - Data span spans multiple decades with varying start/finish dates and continuous continuation in some datasets (e.g., rainfall, cloud)
  - Multiple collection devices and sampling strategies across datasets
  - Filtration largely Lab-based; field measurements include temperature and electrical conductivity for several datasets
  - Data are organized around bulk or grab sampling, with both continuous and intermittent time series implications

- Data management implications for a Data Support perspective
  - Requires integration across heterogeneous datasets with different collection devices, intervals, and metadata
  - Needs harmonization of units and time stamps to enable self-serve analysis
  - Quality assurance and data cleaning essential due to diverse formats and field methods
  - Opportunities to build dashboards or pivot/table-based tools enabling end users to explore rainfall, cloud, stream, groundwater, throughfall, and stemflow data
  - Documentation improvements could aid broader reuse and public communication of outputs
