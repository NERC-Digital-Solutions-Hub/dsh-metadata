# SAMPLING

- This document describes diverse environmental sampling activities across rainfall, cloud, stream water, groundwater, throughfall, and stemflow, detailing collection methods, devices, measurements, intervals, timeframes, and filtration.

## Rainfall
- Collection method: Bulk sample
- Collection device: Continuously open, 15 cm diameter PVC collector with anti-bird protection and coarse filter in the neck of the funnel; alternate device: Warren Spring pattern collector
- Flow/volume: Tanllwyth met site ground-level raingauge
- Field measurements: Air temperature (glass thermometer and thermistor probe)
- Sampling interval: Weekly/daily
- Start: 10-May-1983
- Finish: 18-May-1999
- Filtration: Lab

## Cloud
- Collection method: Bulk sample
- Collection device: CEH (Edinburgh) pattern lidded harp-type passive collector
- Flow/volume: Weight of sample
- Field measurements: None
- Sampling interval: Weekly
- Start: 25-Sep-1990
- Finish: Cont. (ongoing)
- Filtration: Lab

## Stream water
- Collection method: Grab samples
- Collection device: Plastic bucket attached to plastic cord (sample taken near the middle of the stream)
- Flow/volume: CEH stream (flume) gauges used; for streams not sampled by flumes, flow record to nearest flume
- Field measurements: Stream temperature (glass thermometer/thermistor probe), electrical conductivity (field meters, corrected to 25°C)
- Sampling interval: Weekly/Daily
- Start: 10-May-1983
- Finish: Cont. (ongoing)
- Filtration: Field

## Groundwater
- Collection method: Grab samples after flushing boreholes
- Collection device: BGS borehole sampler
- Flow/volume: Dip level recorder (depth referenced to top of borehole cover)
- Field measurements: Groundwater temperature, electrical conductivity (field meters, corrected to 25°C)
- Sampling interval: Monthly/fortnightly/weekly
- Start: 24-Apr-1994
- Finish: 14-Feb-2001
- Filtration: Field

## Throughfall
- Collection method: Bulk sample
- Collection device: Trough collector
- Flow/volume: Volume of sample
- Field measurements: None
- Sampling interval: Fortnightly
- Start: 6-Feb-1984
- Finish: 2-Sep-1991
- Filtration: Lab

## Stemflow
- Collection method: Bulk sample
- Collection device: Plastic tubing wrapped around trees and carboy collector
- Flow/volume: Volume of sample
- Field measurements: None
- Sampling interval: Fortnightly
- Start: 6-Feb-1984
- Finish: 2-Sep-1991
- Filtration: Lab
