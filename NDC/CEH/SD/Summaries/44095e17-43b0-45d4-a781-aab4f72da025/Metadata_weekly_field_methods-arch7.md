# SAMPLING

- This document details sampling metadata for multiple environmental media, focusing on how data were collected, measured, and processed for GIS use.
- Media covered: rainfall, cloud, stream water, groundwater, throughfall, and stemflow.
- For each media type, key metadata fields are provided:
  - COLLECTION METHOD and COLLECTION DEVICE
  - FLOW/VOLUME measurement approach
  - FIELD MEASUREMENTS (types and instruments)
  - SAMPLING INTERVAL (frequency)
  - START and FINISH dates (temporal coverage)
  - FILTRATION (lab or field)
- Rainfall
  - Bulk samples with continuously open collectors (PVC, anti-bird protection; Warren Spring pattern in some cases)
  - Ground-level raingauge for flow/volume
  - Air temperature measured with glass thermometer and thermistor
  - Interval: weekly or daily
  - Start: 10 May 1983; Finish: 18 May 1999 (initial phase); then 25 May 1999 onward (continuous)
  - Filtration: Lab
- Cloud
  - Bulk samples; CEH Edinburgh pattern lidded harp-type passive collector
  - Flow/volume by weight of sample
  - Field measurements: none
  - Interval: weekly
  - Start: 25 Sep 1990; Finish: ongoing (Cont.)
  - Filtration: Lab
- Stream water
  - Grab samples; plastic bucket collection
  - Flow/volume from CEH stream (flume) gauges; for non-flumed streams, flow data from nearest flume
  - Field measurements: stream temperature and electrical conductivity (corrected to 25°C)
  - Interval: weekly/daily
  - Start: 10 May 1983; Finish: ongoing
  - Filtration: Field
- Groundwater
  - Grab samples after flushing boreholes; BGS borehole sampler
  - Depth recorded with dip level recorder (datum at top of borehole)
  - Field measurements: groundwater temperature and electrical conductivity (corrected to 25°C)
  - Interval: monthly, fortnightly, or weekly
  - Start: 24 Apr 1994; Finish: 14 Feb 2001
  - Filtration: Field
- Throughfall
  - Bulk samples; trough collector
  - Flow/volume: volume of sample
  - Field measurements: none
  - Interval: fortnightly
  - Start: 6 Feb 1984; Finish: 2 Sep 1991
  - Filtration: Lab
- Stemflow
  - Bulk samples; plastic tubing around trees with carboy collector
  - Flow/volume: volume of sample
  - Field measurements: none
  - Interval: fortnightly
  - Start: 6 Feb 1984; Finish: 2 Sep 1991
  - Filtration: Lab
- Temporal and methodological diversity highlights:
  - Data spans multiple decades with overlapping and ongoing collections for some media; others end in the early 1990s or early 2000s.
  - Varied collection devices and measurement approaches across media (lab vs field, different collectors, gauging networks).
  - Spatial linkage likely tied to networks referenced (CEH, BGS) for integration.
- GIS-related implications:
  - Requires harmonization of sampling intervals, units, and collection methods to enable integrated map-based visualizations.
  - Need to account for differences in data resolution and lab vs field processing when creating derived spatial products.
  - Temporal alignment across media is essential for analyzing hydrological processes and environmental responses.
