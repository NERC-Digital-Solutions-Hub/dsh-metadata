# Three decades of water quality measurements from the Upper Severn experimental catchments at Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource for research, modelling, environmental management and education

## Overview
- Data are publicly available for education and research; Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEA) retains copyright.

## How to cite
- Users should cite the primary publication: Neal, C. et al., 2011, Hydrological Processes.
- Users should also cite other papers by the above authors as appropriate to the study topics.

## Disclaimers and liability
- Data are provided “as is” with no guarantee of absence of errors or omissions.
- Users assume all risk and are responsible for assessing suitability for their purposes.
- Authors and their employers provide no warranties and assume no liability for accuracy, completeness, or usefulness, nor for rights infringement.

## Raw vs edited data and data editing documentation
- The Raw Data Archive (RDA) is indicated by “RDA” at the end of each variable name; it contains unaltered raw measurements as reported by analytical labs.
- The archive is provided for documentation completeness and transparency regarding subsequent data editing.
- The raw archive allows revisiting original data if new information suggests important phenomena were edited out.
- Routine analyses should use the edited data, where problematic values have been corrected or excluded.
- Details of differences between edited and raw data are provided in the accompanying file, “Plynlimon weekly data editing documentation.pdf.”

## Access and governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure clear licensing and attribution requirements are communicated to data users.
- Maintain both raw and edited data with explicit documentation of edits and rationale.
- Provide or link to the data editing documentation to support reproducibility.
- Highlight that there is an embargo or limitations on certain data by noting data are publicly available but governed by CHERY (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology) copyright.
- Emphasize the need for users to cite the primary publication and relevant author papers to ensure proper credit.
