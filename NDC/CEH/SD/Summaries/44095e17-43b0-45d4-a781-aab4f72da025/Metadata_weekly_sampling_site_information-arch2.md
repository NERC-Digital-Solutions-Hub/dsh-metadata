# DRAINAGE AREAS AND STREAM FLOW CONVERSION

- Purpose and scope
  - A comprehensive dataset of environmental monitoring sites around the Hafren, Tanllwyth, and associated catchments.
  - Records include precise location (Easting/Northing, latitude/longitude, altitude), description, soils, vegetation, land management, mining history, start/end dates, primary reference numbers, and miscellaneous notes.
  - Measurements cover stream channels, flumes, boreholes, rainfall, daily/gridded chloride, total dissolved nitrogen, and related hydrological/chemical data.
  - Data are drawn from established monitoring responsibilities and referenced studies; end dates show ongoing status where indicated.

- Aims and methods (Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype)
  - Use data to demonstrate environmental condition in a consistent, traceable format for health and policy performance over time.
  - Data are verified, quality-assured, cleaned, and transformed; analyses follow standardised methods.
  - Outputs are presented as clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and datasets are stored/uploaded to appropriate portals.
  - Focus on reproducibility and ability to compare across sites and time.

- Site characteristics and patterns (highlights)
  - Areas covered include Lower Hore (A), Lower Hafren (B), Rainfall (C), Upper Hore (D), Tanllwyth (K), Cloud (J), Tanllwyth Bridge (AD), South East sites (M, V), Vyrnwy rainfall/streams, and multiple boreholes and fluorescence-like measurements.
  - Common soils: Podzol/Gley; some sites on peat or Brown Earth.
  - Vegetation: predominantly plantation Sitka spruce with semi-natural moorland headwaters; some sites have unplanted or mixed conditions.
  - Land management often includes forestry activities (e.g., clearfelling in 1985–1988, 1995), with other areas in rough grazing or unmanaged states.
  - Mining history noted (historic Pb/Zn near top catchment) at several sites.
  - Time span: data entries begin in the 1980s (1983–1985) with ongoing monitoring into the 1990s and early 2000s; many sites show “End Date = Cont..”.

- Data types and outputs
  - Hydrological: stream channels, flumes, and discharge-related observations; some sites use boreholes and ephemeral/seasonal streams.
  - Chemical/meteorological: rainfall, daily chloride, total dissolved nitrogen, cloud water and rainfall chemistry reports.
  - Data are tied to reference publications (10 key references listed) documenting hydrochemistry, rainfall chemistry, and impacts of forestry practices on water quality.
  - Outputs suitable for long-term trend analysis, cross-site comparisons, and policy evaluation.

- References and context
  - Key studies cited include investigations into hydrochemistry of the River Severn headwaters, nitrogen and chloride cycling in rainfall and stream water, and the impact of conifer harvesting on stream water quality.
  - Ten primary references span hydrology, water quality, atmospheric deposition, and forestry-related impacts on hydrological systems.

- Drainage areas and flow conversion (core figures)
  - Site codes and catchment areas (sq. km.):
    - Lower Hore (A): 3.172
    - Upper Hore (D): 1.62
    - Tanllwyth (K): 0.916
    - Lower Hafren (B): 3.58
    - Upper Hafren (G): 1.22
    - Note: Upper Hafren drainage area includes 122 ha to the flow gauging structure and 117 ha to the chemistry sampling point.
  - Flow conversions:
    - To convert from Cumecs to mm/15min (flow): mm/15min = cumecs × 0.9 / catchment_area_km2
    - To convert from mm/15min (flow) to Cumecs: cumecs = (mm/15min) × catchment_area_km2 / 0.9

- Practical implications for monitoring work
  - The dataset provides a standardized basis for assessing environmental health across multiple catchments with consistent geographic and hydrological parameters.
  - The conversion guidelines enable integration of discharge measurements with rainfall/chemistry data for unified analyses.
  - The documented site histories inform interpretation of long-term trends in water quality, especially in relation to forestry practices and land management changes.
