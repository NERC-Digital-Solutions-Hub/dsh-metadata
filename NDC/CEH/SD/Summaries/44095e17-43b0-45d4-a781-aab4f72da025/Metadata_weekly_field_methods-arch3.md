# SAMPLING

- This document documents sampling metadata across environmental media, including collection methods, devices, flow/volume, field measurements, sampling intervals, timeframes, and filtration approaches.

## Rainfall
- COLLECTION METHOD: Bulk sample
- COLLECTION DEVICE: Continuously open, 15 cm diameter PVC collector with anti-bird protection & coarse filter in neck of funnel
- FLOW/VOLUME: Tanllwyth met site ground level raingauge
- FIELD MEASUREMENTS: Air temperature (glass thermometer and thermistor probe)
- SAMPLING INTERVAL: Weekly/daily
- START: 10-May-1983
- FINISH: 18-May-1999
- FILTRATION: Lab
- NOTES: A second rainfall setup uses Warren Spring pattern collector (bulk sample) with anti-bird protection & coarse filter; similar sampling interval and lab filtration

## Cloud
- COLLECTION METHOD: Bulk sample
- COLLECTION DEVICE: CEH (Edinburgh) pattern lidded harp type passive collector
- FLOW/VOLUME: Weight of sample
- FIELD MEASUREMENTS: None
- SAMPLING INTERVAL: Weekly
- START: 25-Sep-1990
- FINISH: Cont.
- FILTRATION: Lab

## Stream water
- COLLECTION METHOD: Grab samples
- COLLECTION DEVICE: Plastic bucket attached to plastic cord; sample taken close to middle of stream
- FLOW/VOLUME: CEH stream (flume) gauges used according to hydrological network; for streams not sampled by flumes, flow record given to nearest flume
- FIELD MEASUREMENTS: Stream temperature (glass thermometer/thermistor probe), electrical conductivity (field conductivity meters corrected to 25 Deg C)
- SAMPLING INTERVAL: Weekly/Daily
- START: 10-May-1983
- FINISH: Cont.
- FILTRATION: Field

## Groundwater
- COLLECTION METHOD: Grab samples after flushing of boreholes
- COLLECTION DEVICE: BGS borehole sampler
- FLOW/VOLUME: Dip level recorder; depth given to datum of top of the borehole cover
- FIELD MEASUREMENTS: Groundwater temperature (glass thermometer/thermistor probe), electrical conductivity (field conductivity meters corrected to 25 Deg C)
- SAMPLING INTERVAL: Monthly/fortnightly/weekly
- START: 24-Apr-1994
- FINISH: 14-Feb-2001
- FILTRATION: Field

## Throughfall
- COLLECTION METHOD: Bulk sample
- COLLECTION DEVICE: Trough collector
- FLOW/VOLUME: Volume of sample
- FIELD MEASUREMENTS: None
- SAMPLING INTERVAL: Fortnightly
- START: 6-Feb-1984
- FINISH: 2-Sep-1991
- FILTRATION: Lab

## Stemflow
- COLLECTION METHOD: Bulk sample
- COLLECTION DEVICE: Plastic tubing wrapped around trees and carboy collector
- FLOW/VOLUME: Volume of sample
- FIELD MEASUREMENTS: None
- SAMPLING INTERVAL: Fortnightly
- START: 6-Feb-1984
- FINISH: 2-Sep-1991
- FILTRATION: Lab

## Overall timeframes and processing notes
- Timeframes range from 1983 through 2001, with varying end dates and some continuous data after initial start periods.
- Filtration methods are predominantly Lab for rainfall, cloud, throughfall, and stemflow, with Field filtration used for groundwater and some stream measurements.
- Data collection involves multiple distinct media and collection devices, highlighting the need for harmonised metadata to enable cross-media monitoring and policy evaluation.
