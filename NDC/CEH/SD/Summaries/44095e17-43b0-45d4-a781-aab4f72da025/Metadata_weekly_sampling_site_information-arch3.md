# DRAINAGE AREAS AND STREAM FLOW CONVERSION

- This document provides a detailed inventory of catchment monitoring sites, measurements, and hydrological data for the Hafren catchment (mid-Wales), including Lower Hore, Lower Hafren, Upper Hafren, Tanllwyth, and associated sites. It also includes metadata on soils, vegetation, land management, and mining history, as well as references to related scientific studies and a method for converting flow measurements to catchment-scale fluxes.

## Overview of the Monitoring Context

- Focus: long-term hydrochemistry and hydrology monitoring to assess environmental health aspects and inform policy decisions, including impacts of forestry management on water quality.
- Geography: Hafren headwaters and surrounding sub-catchments (e.g., Tanllwyth, Vyrnwy-related sites) in mid-Wales.
- Temporal scope: data spans from the early 1980s/1990s through at least the late 1990s to early 2000s for various measurements; multiple time series are linked to specific start and end dates.
- Policy-relevant themes: effects of conifer harvesting, land management practices, rainfall and cloud water chemistry, stream and groundwater quality, and long-term hydrological responses.

## Measurements, Sites and Timeframe

- Core site codes and catchments:
  - Lower Hore (A), Upper Hore (D), Tanllwyth (K), Lower Hafren (B), Upper Hafren (G), South East sites (e.g., SE 1, SE 3), Vyrnwy-related locations (rainfall and streams), and multiple boreholes and ditch/stream sampling points (e.g., Tanllwyth Bridge, Tan North/South, Vyrnwy1/2 streams and boreholes, Intermediate slope and Lower slope boreholes).
- Key measurement types:
  - Discharge/flow data (e.g., Tanllwyth flume measurements; Tanllwyth discharge readings).
  - Rainfall and cloud-related measurements (rainfall totals, rainfall chloride, daily chloride in rainfall).
  - Hydrological chemistry: daily chloride in Lower Hafren, total dissolved nitrogen at Carreg Wen.
  - Throughfall and stemflow (precipitation interactions with forest canopy).
  - Groundwater/subsurface data (groundwater references; various boreholes).
  - Ancillary site descriptors: soil types (predominantly Podzol/Gley and Peat), vegetation (mainly Sitka spruce plantation with semi-natural moorland headwaters), land management (phased felling, clearfelled periods, standing crop), mining history (historic Pb/Zn near top catchment).
- Temporal notes:
  - Start dates range from 1983 to 1995 for various components; end dates extend to 1997–2001 for several measurements; some series are listed as “Cont..” (ongoing at the time).
- References and scientific context:
  - The dataset is tied to a suite of published studies (references numbered 1–10) focusing on cloud water, rainfall, stream chemistry, effects of forestry on water quality, and hydrochemistry of plantation forests and headwaters.

## Data Conversion and Catchment Areas

- Catchment areas (approximate, square kilometers):
  - Lower Hore: 3.172
  - Upper Hore: 1.62
  - Tanllwyth: 0.916
  - Lower Hafren: 3.58
  - Upper Hafren: 1.22
- Flow conversion guidance:
  - To convert from Cumecs to mm/15 min (flow): mm/15min = cumecs × 0.9 / catchment_area_km2
  - To convert from mm/15 min to Cumecs: cumecs = (mm/15min) × catchment_area_km2 / 0.9

## References and Scientific Context

- The dataset references multiple hydrology and environmental chemistry publications, highlighting:
  - The hydrochemistry of the River Severn headwaters and associated hydrological processes.
  - Impacts of conifer harvesting on stream water quality and long-term catchment responses.
  - Nitrogen dynamics in rainfall, cloud water,Throughfall, Stemflow, and groundwater in plantation forest catchments.
  - The water quality of streams draining plantation forests on gley soils and related groundwater interactions.
- Specific references cover a range of topics from cloud water chemistry to forest management impacts on hydrology, providing a robust scientific context for interpreting the monitoring dataset.

## Relevance to Monitoring Frameworks

- Data richness and structure:
  - Rich metadata accompanying each site (location, soil type, vegetation, land management, and mining history) supports cross-site comparisons and policy-relevant assessments.
  - Time-series data across hydrology and chemistry domains enable analysis of trends, responses to land-management changes (e.g., clearfelling), and long-term ecosystem health indicators.
- Data governance considerations illustrated:
  - The dataset highlights the importance of metadata completeness, consistent measurement definitions, and clear documentation of start/end dates for time-series.
  - The breadth of measurements and links to primary references demonstrate the value of integrating multiple data streams (flow, chemistry, rainfall, throughfall, groundwater) for environmental policy evaluation.
- Implications for policy and practice:
  - Demonstrates how long-term, multi-site monitoring can inform policy decisions about forestry practices and water quality management.
  - Underlines the need for standardized data handling, transparent data sharing, and governance processes to ensure datasets remain usable and comparable over time.
- Practical notes for framework authors:
  - Emphasize standardized metadata schemas, clear data provenance, and accessible data sharing to avoid silos.
  - Include conversion methods and site-specific context to support reproducibility and policy-relevant analysis.
