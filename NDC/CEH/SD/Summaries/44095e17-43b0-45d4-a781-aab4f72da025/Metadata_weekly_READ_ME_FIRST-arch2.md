- No guarantee that use of the data or related outputs infringes private rights.

## Raw vs edited data
- The Raw Data Archive (RDA) contains unaltered raw measurements as reported by laboratories.
- Transcription corrections and adjustments may exist, traceable to original lab files.
- RDA is provided for completeness and transparency regarding subsequent data editing.
- The raw data archive allows re-checking original data if new information emerges suggesting important phenomena were edited out.

## Recommendations for analysis
- Do not rely on raw data for routine analyses due to the presence of substantial errors in some values.
- Use the edited dataset for routine analyses, applying corrections or exclusions where data quality issues have been addressed.
- Differences between edited and raw data are documented in detail.

## Documentation and provenance
- The relationship between edited data and the raw archive is explained in the accompanying file: "Plynlimon weekly data editing documentation.pdf".
- The documentation provides guidance on why and how edits were made and facilitates traceability.
