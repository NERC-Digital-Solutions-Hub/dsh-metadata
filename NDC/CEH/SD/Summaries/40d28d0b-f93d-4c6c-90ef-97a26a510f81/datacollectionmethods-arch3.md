# Data collection methods (adapted from Bennett et al (2022) Ecology and Evolution)

## Purpose and monitoring design
- Quantify occupancy of breeding sites during the non-breeding season using time-lapse photography.
- Install cameras in two common guillemot sub-colonies; start in late September before return.
- Define the non-breeding season as the period from first return to end of March; focus on occupancy patterns across 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20.
- Acknowledge limitations: no night vision; occupancy inferred from periods with sufficient light (nighttime occupancy noted only on moonlit nights).

## Data collection and site definition
- Images collected: 83,834.
- Breeding site defined as a small cliff ledge (~10 cm x 10 cm) where a pair later incubates.
- Create site maps with unique IDs to ensure consistent site-level tracking across seasons.
- For each image, record whether zero, one, or two birds were present at each site.
- Monitored: sub-colony 1 (26–29 sites) and sub-colony 2 (51–54 sites); occasional data gaps due to fog or battery issues.
- To minimize impact of gaps, express key occupancy measures as proportional values.

## Precursor fidelity and data interpretation
- Assess whether individuals occupy their future breeding site during the non-breeding season by tagging ringed birds (color combinations recorded).
- >99.3% of observed birds (n=3,485) were found at their future breeding site, supporting the assumption that occupancy at a site represents future breeders.
- Based on this, treat site occupancy as representing individuals that will breed at that site.

## Occupancy measures derived
- Return date: ordinal first date on which one or two birds occupy a site.
- Occupancy frequency: proportion of days from return date to end of March that a site is occupied (by one or two birds).
- Relative time investment: proportion of images on each day indicating occupancy at a site, relative to other sites in the sub-colony.
- Calculate equivalent measures for cases when just one or two birds are present.

## Breeding timing and success measures
- Conduct detailed daily observations from before first egg laid (late April) to after last chick fledges (mid-July) to determine timing and lay date at each site.
- Breeding attempt considered successful if a chick reaches at least 15 days of age (typical single chick per year species).
- In 2020, due to COVID-19 restrictions, relied heavily on camera data instead of field observations to collect breeding data; this approach aligns with methods used for other seabirds.

## Site quality measures
- Sub-colony 1: use the average breeding success of a site, calculated from data collected 1981–2016, as a measure of site quality (total successful breeding attempts divided by total attempts at the site).
- Sub-colony 2: no site quality measure available due to lack of site-characteristics data and long-term success data.
- Rationale: higher-quality sites tend to be occupied more and yield higher breeding success.

## Data sources and references
- The methods are adapted from Bennett et al. (2022) and supported by prior work on habitat, density, and breeding success influences in guillemots and related seabirds.
- Key references include studies on site-dependent regulation, nest/site characteristics, and long-term occupancy and breeding success patterns.
