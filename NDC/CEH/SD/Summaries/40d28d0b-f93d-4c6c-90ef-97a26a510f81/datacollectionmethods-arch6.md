# Data collection methods (adapted from Bennett et al (2022) Ecology and Evolution)

## Overview
- Objective: quantify occupancy of breeding sites during the non-breeding season, breeding timing, and breeding success in two sub-colonies of common guillemots.
- Methods: time-lapse photography with cameras at predefined sub-colony sites over three study years (2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20).
- Data scale: large image dataset (83,834 images) across 26–29 sites in sub-colony 1 and 51–54 sites in sub-colony 2.
- Adaptations: 2020 relied more on images due to limited site access during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Study setup and data collection
- Cameras installed in late September before birds return post-breeding exodus.
- Non-breeding season defined as first colony return date through end of March; breeding season observations occur from late April to mid-July.
- Sampling intervals: 30-minute intervals in 2017/18; 15-minute intervals in 2018/19 and 2019/20.
- Night visibility: cameras lacked night vision; presence inferred on moonlit nights near dawn/dusk.

## Data scoring and site definitions
- Breeding site defined as a ~10 cm x 10 cm cliff ledge where a pair incubates.
- For consistency, prior-season images were used to map sites and assign unique IDs.
- Occupancy scoring: per image, record 0, 1, or 2 birds using site maps as references.
- Data gaps: periods of fog or battery failure caused unscorable times; gaps handled in analysis.

## Occupancy measures
- Return date: first date on which one or two birds occupied a site.
- Occupancy frequency: proportion of days with occupancy (from return date to end of March).
- Relative time investment: proportion of images on days with occupancy divided by the total number of images on days when at least one bird was present.
- Occupancy measures calculated for scenarios with one or two birds (and extended to those scenarios).

## Breeding timing and success
- Daily observations (pre-egg laying through post-fledging) to determine lay date at each site.
- Breeding success: defined as a chick reaching at least 15 days old (allowing for one chick per pair per year).
- 2020 adaptation: due to pandemic restrictions, relied more on image-based data to monitor phenology and success.

## Site quality measures
- Sub-colony 1: site quality measured by average breeding success across sites using data from 1981–2016 (total successful attempts divided by total attempts at each site).
- Sub-colony 2: no site quality measure available due to lack of long-term data and physical site characteristic data.

## Data treatment and assumptions
- Key assumption: individuals occupy the same site in the non-breeding season as their future breeding site.
- Validation: ringed birds observed on their future breeding site in >99.3% of cases (n=3,485 observations across sub-colonies).
- Therefore, occupancy measures at each site are interpreted as representing individuals that will breed there.

## Handling data gaps and quality assurance
- Gaps due to weather or power loss mitigated by expressing occupancy as proportional measures, reducing bias from missing data.
- Consistency checks: use of same vantage points across seasons to map sites and maintain comparability.

## Limitations and considerations
- No night-vision capability; nighttime occupancy inferred only during favorable light conditions.
- Sub-colony 2 lacked long-term site quality data, limiting comparisons of site characteristics.
- Some sites experienced data loss in certain years, potentially affecting absolute counts but mitigated by proportional metrics.

## Key outputs and references
- Outputs include three occupancy measures (return date, occupancy frequency, relative time investment) and breeding timing/success data, plus site quality insights for sub-colony 1.
