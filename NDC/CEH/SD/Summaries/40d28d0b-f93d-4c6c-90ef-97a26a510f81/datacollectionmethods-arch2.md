# Data collection methods (adapted from Bennett et al (2022) Ecology and Evolution)

- Objective
  - Apply standardized monitoring methods to quantify environmental health indicators in seabird populations, focusing on occupancy, breeding timing, and site quality to inform environmental monitoring and policy performance.

- Study design and data collection
  - Species and site: common guillemot across two breeding sub-colonies (sub-colony 1 and sub-colony 2).
  - Timing:
    - Non-breeding season defined from first return to the colony in spring to end of March.
    - Breeding season observations conducted from late April (first egg) to mid-July (fledging).
  - Data collection methods:
    - Time-lapse cameras installed in late September to capture occupancy across non-breeding and breeding periods.
    - External timers triggered images every 30 minutes (2017/18) and every 15 minutes (2018/19, 2019/20).
    - Night vision not available; occupancy inferred from daylight and moonlit conditions.
  - Sampling effort:
    - Sub-colony 1: 26–29 sites monitored each year.
    - Sub-colony 2: 51–54 sites monitored each year.
    - Occasional data gaps due to fog or battery power; image-based scoring used to mitigate impact.

- Image scoring and site mapping
  - Site definition: breeding site as a ~10 cm x 10 cm cliff ledge where a pair incubates.
  - Consistency: used prior-season vantage points to map sites and assign unique IDs.
  - Occupancy scoring: for each time-lapse image, record zero, one, or two birds per site.
  - Data integrity:
    - Retrospective scoring for sites not previously bred.
    - For sub-colonies, occupancy data aligned to site-level maps to enable longitudinal comparison.
  - Verification of site fidelity:
    - Ringed birds (n=29 in sub-colony 1; n=37 in sub-colony 2) observed returning to their future breeding site in >99.3% of cases (3,485 observations), supporting the assumption that occupancy at a site reflects future breeding.

- Occupancy measures (three metrics)
  - Return date: the ordinal first date a site is occupied by one or two birds.
  - Occupancy frequency: proportion of days from return date to end of March with at least one or two birds present.
  - Relative time investment: fraction of images on days a site is occupied relative to total images on days with at least one bird present in the sub-colony.
  - Both one- and two-bird occupancy were considered, yielding equivalent measures.

- Breeding timing and success
  - Daily observations (before first egg to after last chick fledges) to determine:
    - Lay date: first day an egg is observed at a site.
    - Breeding success: a chick reaching at least 15 days old constitutes a successful attempt (given guillemot biology of one chick per year); 2020 largely used imagery due to COVID-19 restrictions.
  - Data collection modes:
    - Sub-colony 1: observations from a permanent hide.
    - Sub-colony 2: observations from a vantage point overhead.
  - Adaptations:
    - 2020 relied on camera-derived breeding data, aligned with methods used for other seabird phenology assessments (image-based monitoring).

- Site quality measures
  - Rationale: higher-quality sites are more likely to be occupied and yield successful breeding.
  - Sub-colony 1: site quality measured using long-term (1981–2016) average breeding success per site (ratio of successful attempts to total attempts).
  - Sub-colony 2: no site-quality metric available due to lack of long-term data on physical site characteristics and breeding success.

- Data handling and outputs
  - Data processing aligns with standardized methods to produce interpretable outputs (e.g., occupancy metrics, breeding timing, site quality indicators).
  - Outputs are suitable for reporting, mapping, and visualization to support environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
  - Data are designed for storage and sharing through appropriate data portals.
