# Data collection methods (adapted from Bennett et al (2022) Ecology and Evolution)

- Overview
  - Time-lapse photography was used to quantify breeding site occupancy during the non-breeding season across two common guillemot sub-colonies.
  - Cameras were installed in late September; non-breeding season defined as the period from first return to end of March.
  - Sampling varied by year: 2017/18 used images every 30 minutes; 2018/19 and 2019/20 used every 15 minutes. Night vision was not available; presence overnight was inferred from moonlit periods.

- Data collection scope and period
  - Occupancy data collected for sub-colony 1 in 2017/18; for both sub-colonies in 2018/19 and 2019/20.
  - Sites monitored: sub-colony 1 (26–29 sites/year) and sub-colony 2 (51–54 sites/year).
  - Occasional data gaps occurred due to fog or battery power loss; gaps were addressed by treating occupancy measures as proportional values.

- Image scoring and site definition
  - A breeding site was defined as a ~10 cm x 10 cm cliff ledge where a pair would incubate.
  - Images from the previous breeding season were used to map sites with unique IDs and ensure consistency across seasons.
  - For each time-lapse image, occupancy was recorded as 0, 1, or 2 birds per site.
  - Some sites could not be scored every day due to conditions.

- Data treatment and key assumptions
  - Verified that most individuals occupied their future breeding site; >99.3% (n=3,485 observations) occupied the site where they would breed, supporting the assumption that site occupancy measures reflect future breeders.
  - Three occupancy measures derived for each site:
    - Return date: the ordinal date of first occupancy (1st day with 1 or 2 birds).
    - Occupancy frequency: proportion of days from return date to end of March with occupancy (1 or 2 birds).
    - Relative time investment: ratio of images showing occupancy to all images on days with at least one bird present in the sub-colony; calculated separately for one- and two-bird occupancy where applicable.

- Breeding timing and success measures
  - Detailed daily observations from before egg laying (late April) to after fledging (mid-July) to determine lay dates and breeding success.
  - Lay date: first day an egg was observed at a site.
  - Breeding success: a chick fledging age of at least 15 days; in 2020, image-based data collection predominated due to COVID-19 restrictions, consistent with methods used for other seabirds.

- Site quality measures
  - For sub-colony 1, site quality was proxied by the long-term average breeding success (1981–2016) per site (successful breeding attempts divided by total breeding attempts at the site).
  - For sub-colony 2, no site-quality measure was available due to lack of physical site characteristics data or long-term breeding success data.

- Data gaps, limitations, and governance considerations
  - Potential data gaps due to fog or power issues; occupancy measures rely on proportional values to mitigate missing data.
  - Lack of night-vision capability; occupancy inference limited to daylight/visible periods.
  - 2020 shift to image-based data collection due to COVID-19; aligns with established methodologies but may affect comparability with direct-observation years.
  - Sub-colony 2 lacks long-term site-quality data, limiting comparative analyses across sub-colonies.
  - Documentation supports reproducibility: use of prior-season vantage points, unique site IDs, and explicit definitions of occupancy and breeding measures.
