# Data collection methods (adapted from Bennett et al (2022) Ecology and Evolution)

- Objective
  - Quantify breeding site occupancy during the non-breeding season and derive measures of breeding timing and success.
  - Define and calculate site quality measures to understand factors influencing occupancy and success.

- Monitoring design
  - Study system: two common guillemot breeding sub-colonies (sub-colony 1 and sub-colony 2).
  - Hardware and timing: time-lapse cameras installed in late September; images captured every 30 minutes in 2017/18 and every 15 minutes in 2018/19 and 2019/20.
  - Non-breeding season definition: from first return to the colony to the end of March; night-vision not available, but presence/absence inferred on moonlit nights and around sunrise/sunset.
  - Sampling years and sites: non-breeding occupancy data for sub-colony 1 only in 2017/18; both sub-colonies in 2018/19 and 2019/20.
  - Data volume: n = 83,834 images.

- Image scoring and site mapping
  - Site definition: a ~10 cm x 10 cm cliff ledge where a pair later incubates an egg; each site assigned a unique ID based on prior-season vantage points.
  - Occupancy per image: record 0, 1, or 2 birds per site.
  - Site coverage: sub-colony 1 monitored 26–29 sites/year; sub-colony 2 monitored 51–54 sites/year.
  - Data gaps: occasional unscorable periods due to fog or battery loss; data gaps treated as proportional measures to mitigate impact.

- Data treatment and occupancy measures
  - Validation of site fidelity: ringed birds used to confirm site fidelity; >99.3% observed at their future breeding site, supporting the assumption that occupancy measures reflect individuals that will breed at that site.
  - Occupancy measures derived from images:
    - Return date: ordinal date when a site first hosts one or two birds.
    - Occupancy frequency: proportion of days from return date to end of March that a site is occupied (by one or two birds).
    - Relative time investment: proportion of daily images showing site occupancy relative to the total images on days when at least one bird is present in the sub-colony.
  - Occupancy calculations also produced for scenarios with just one bird or two birds present.

- Breeding timing and success
  - Daily observations around breeding: from just before the first egg to after fledging; lay date recorded as the first day an egg is observed at a site.
  - Breeding success definition: a chick reaches at least 15 days old.
  - 2020 notes: due to limited site access amid COVID-19, data for breeding timing and success were largely collected from images rather than direct observation, a method aligned with prior seabird studies.

- Site quality measures
  - Sub-colony 1: site quality quantified using the long-term (1981–2016) average breeding success per site (total successful attempts divided by total attempts).
  - Sub-colony 2: no site-quality measure available due to lack of physical site data or long-term success data.

- Key considerations and limitations
  - The different camera sampling regimes did not affect results or conclusions.
  - Some data gaps existed due to weather or equipment, but proportional measures helped minimise impact.
  - Site quality was only available for sub-colony 1; sub-colony 2 could not be assigned a site-quality measure.
