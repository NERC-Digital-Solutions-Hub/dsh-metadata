# Data collection methods (adapted from Bennett et al (2022) Ecology and Evolution)

- Purpose: quantify breeding site occupancy during the non-breeding season using time-lapse cameras at two guillemot sub-colonies; define and analyze occupancy, breeding timing, success, and site quality across multiple years.

- Study design and timing:
  - Cameras installed in late September before birds return after the post-breeding exodus.
  - Non-breeding season defined as the period from the return date to the end of March; breeding season observations extend from late April to mid-July.
  - Years of data: 2017/18 (sub-colony 1 only for non-breeding season), 2018/19 and 2019/20 (both sub-colonies).
  - Sampling frequency: every 30 minutes in 2017/18; every 15 minutes in 2018/19 and 2019/20.
  - Night vision not available; presence can be inferred on moonlit nights and at low light edges.

- Data collection and scoring:
  - Images captured (n=83,834) to record site occupancy.
  - Breeding sites defined as ~10 cm x 10 cm cliff ledges; sites mapped from previous breeding season with unique IDs.
  - Occupancy per image recorded as zero, one, or two birds for each site.
  - Sub-colony site counts: sub-colony 1 monitored at 26–29 sites; sub-colony 2 at 51–54 sites.
  - Data gaps due to fog or battery loss occurred but analyzed with proportional occupancy measures to minimize impact.

- Data treatment and assumptions:
  - Verified that individuals predominantly return to and occupy their future breeding site; ringed birds (color-marked) data show >99.3% observed on their future site (n=3,485 observations).
  - Consequently, occupancy measures at each site are treated as representing individuals that will breed there.

- Occupancy measures (three types):
  - Return date: first date on which one or two birds occupy a site (ordinal date).
  - Occupancy frequency: proportion of days from return date to end of March with occupancy (one or two birds).
  - Relative time investment: daily duration of occupancy at a site relative to other sites, calculated as the proportion of images showing occupancy for that site on each day.
  - These measures are calculated separately for one and two birds where applicable.

- Breeding timing and success:
  - Daily observations from before first egg laid (late April) until after chick fledges (mid-July) to determine lay date and breeding success.
  - Breeding success defined as chick reaching at least 15 days of age.
  - 2020 relied largely on image data due to limited site access during COVID-19; method aligns with other seabird phenology studies.

- Site quality measures:
  - Sub-colony 1: site quality estimated using long-term average breeding success (1981–2016) per site; site quality = total successful breeding attempts / total breeding attempts at the site.
  - Sub-colony 2: no site quality measure due to lack of long-term site data or physical site characteristic data.
