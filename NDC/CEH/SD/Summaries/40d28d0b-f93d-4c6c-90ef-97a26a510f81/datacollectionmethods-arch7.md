# Data collection methods (adapted from Bennett et al (2022) Ecology and Evolution)

## Overview and aim
- Quantify non-breeding season occupancy of breeding sites in two guillemot sub-colonies using time-lapse photography.
- Study period: 2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20; sub-colony 1 monitored 26–29 sites, sub-colony 2 monitored 51–54 sites.
- Sampling intervals: every 30 minutes in 2017/18; every 15 minutes in 2018/19 and 2019/20.
- Definitions: non-breeding season defined from the first return to end of March; conditions during low light (night) limited for scoring.

## Data collection setup
- Cameras installed in late September prior to bird return.
- Images collected from two fixed vantage points per sub-colony, with consistent site marking across seasons.
- Some data gaps occurred due to fog or battery issues; occupancy measures are treated as proportional values to mitigate these gaps.

## Site mapping and scoring
- A breeding site is defined as a ~10 cm × 10 cm cliff ledge where a pair incubates an egg.
- Each site assigned a unique ID; images used to determine presence of zero, one, or two birds per site per image.
- For consistency, images from the preceding breeding season were used to map sites and positions.
- Non-breeding occupancy data were derived for each site, with attention to consistent site identification across seasons.

## Non-breeding occupancy measures
- Return date: the first ordinal date when one or two birds occupied a site.
- Occupancy frequency: proportion of days (from return date to end of March) that one or two birds were present.
- Relative time investment: daily occupancy expressed as a proportion of the number of images showing occupancy relative to total images on days with any occupancy.
- Measures computed for both one- and two-bird occupancy per site.

## Data treatment and validation
- Verified that individuals predominantly occupy their future breeding site ( >99.3% across observed ringed birds), supporting the assumption that occupancy measures reflect future breeders.
- This validation underpins using site occupancy data as representative of future breeding sites.

## Breeding timing and success
- Daily observations from late April to mid-July to determine lay dates and breeding success.
- Sub-colony 1 observed from a permanent hide; sub-colony 2 from an overlooking vantage point.
- Lay date: first day an egg is observed at a site.
- Breeding success: a chick reaching at least 15 days of age; in 2020, reliance on images due to limited site access (COVID-19).

## Site quality measures
- Sub-colony 1: site quality approximated by the average breeding success across sites using 1981–2016 data (total successful attempts divided by total attempts at a site).
- Sub-colony 2: no site quality measure available due to lack of long-term data and physical site characteristics data.

## Data limitations and considerations for GIS use
- Data gaps due to weather and power interruptions; proportional occupancy helps preserve comparability.
- Differences in data collection methods between sub-colonies (observer-based for sub-colony 1 vs. camera-based for 2020) may affect comparability.
- Site quality data are incomplete for one sub-colony; integrate with caution in spatial analyses.
