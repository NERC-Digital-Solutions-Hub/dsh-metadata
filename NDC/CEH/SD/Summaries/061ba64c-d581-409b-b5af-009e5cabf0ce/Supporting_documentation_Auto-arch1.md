# Autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration fluxes from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- CO2 respiration fluxes measured during summers 2013 and 2014.
- Comparisons across: peatland plateau vs thawing peatland features; unburnt vs burnt black spruce forest; plus additional sites.
- Purpose: partition fluxes into heterotrophic and autotrophic+heterotrophic components and derive flux rates.

## Site Codes and Descriptions
- FFU: FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
- FFB: FireFox Burnt (burnt in 1998)
- BLF: BlackFox (black spruce forest)
- WHF: WhiteFox (white spruce forest)
- TPP: Teslin Peatland Plateau
- TWMID: Teslin Wetland Mid (center of thawed plateau)
- TWM: Teslin Wetland Margin (margin of thawed plateau)
- MCU: Mosquito Creek Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
- MCB: Mosquito Creek Burnt (burnt black spruce forest)
- WTP: White Truck Plateau (peatland plateau near Yellowknife)
- WTM: White Truck Moss (recently thawed plateau, moss-dominated)
- WTS: White Truck Sedge (recently thawed plateau, sedge/moss)
- WTW: White Truck Wetland (older thaw feature)
- BCB: Boundary Creek Birch (birch forest)
- BCS: Boundary Creek Spruce (black spruce forest)

## Methods: Experimental Setup
- Collars and trenching
  - Heterotrophic respiration: PVC collars installed; depth up to thaw depth or 40 cm; trunk/vegetation removal to minimize autotrophic signal.
  - Autotrophic+heterotrophic respiration: PVC collars placed on ground surface; putty used to seal around edges to minimize leakage.
  - Trenching to minimize root influence: conducted prior to measurements in most sites (FFU, FFB, BLF, WHF, TPP, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS) and during the measurement summer for TWMID, TWM, WTM, WTS, WTW.
  - Replicates: 3–5 collars per site for each respiration type.
  - Collar dimensions: sites FFU, FFB, BLF, WHF, TPP, MCU, MCB, WTP, WTB, BCB, BCS used 160 mm diameter by 5 cm long (autotrophic+heterotrophic) and 45 cm long (heterotrophic). Sites TWMID, TWM, WTM, WTS used 315 mm diameter and 10–15 cm long for autotrophic+heterotrophic; 45 cm long for heterotrophic.
- Access and disturbance minimization
  - Boardwalks constructed to access thawing features and minimize disturbance during gas flux measurements.

## CO2 Flux Measurements
- Instrumentation
  - CO2 fluxes measured with an EGM-4 Infrared Gas Analyzer.
  - For most sites (FFU, FFB, BLF, WHF, TPP, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS): CPY-4 chamber used; dark conditions to prevent photosynthesis; chamber placed on collar; flux rate derived after 1.5–2 minutes; measurement repeated if initial-final flux difference was large.
  - For sites TWMID, TWM, WTW, WTM, WTS: PVC enclosures (15–35 cm high) placed on collars; inner tube used to secure and prevent leakage; enclosure time typically ≤3 minutes; concentrations recorded at ~10 s intervals.
- Flux calculation
  - Flux rates estimated from the slope of linear regression of CO2 concentrations vs. time.
  - Intercept and R^2 of regression reported where applicable.
  - Flux units: mg CO2 m^-2 d^-1 or mg CO2-C m^-2 d^-1.
- Ancillary measurements
  - Air temperature recorded from on-site weather station.
  - Soil temperature measured at 5 cm and 10 cm inside the collar after removing the chamber.
  - Volumetric soil moisture at the surface (top 6 cm) using ML3 ThetaKit (Delta-T Devices) with default calibration.
  - Thaw depth measured with a metal rod until resistance encountered.
  - Water table depth recorded as distance from a fixed datum; a long rod inserted at season start to establish datum.

## Data Coding and Compatibility Notes
- Coding of autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration fluxes aligns with the soil profiles dataset, but flux data and soil core data originate from different locations.
- GPS coordinates provided in files should be used to verify spatial alignment; example notes that soil profile data (e.g., TPP1) may not spatially match flux data from the same site.
- Users should account for potential spatial mismatches when integrating flux data with soil core data or other datasets.
