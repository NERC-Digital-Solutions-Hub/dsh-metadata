# Autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration fluxes from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Aim
- Report CO2 respiration flux measurements conducted during summers 2013 and 2014.
- Compare peatland plateaus with thawing features, and burnt vs unburnt black spruce forests, including additional sites.

## Sites and codes
- FFU - FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
- FFB - FireFox Burnt (burnt in 1998)
- BLF - BlackFox
- WHF - WhiteFox
- TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau
- TWMID - Teslin Wetland Mid
- TWM - Teslin Wetland Margin
- MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt
- MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt
- WTP - White Truck Plateau
- WTM - White Truck Moss
- WTS - White Truck Sedge
- WTW - White Truck Wetland
- BCB - Boundary Creek Birch
- BCS - Boundary Creek Spruce
- Sites span peatland plateaus, thawing features, and various forest types near subarctic Canada.

## Experimental setup
- Collars deployed to partition CO2 fluxes into heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic+heterotrophic respiration.
- Heterotrophic respiration: PVC collars inserted deep into soil (up to thaw depth, up to 40 cm); surface vegetation clipped; trenches cut in previous season at many sites to minimize autotrophic contribution; patchy sites trenched in different years.
- Autotrophic+heterotrophic respiration: PVC collars placed on ground surface with putty around edges to reduce leakage and root damage.
- Replication: three to five replicates per site for each respiration type.

## Measurement apparatus and protocol
- Gas flux monitoring with an EGM-4 Infrared Gas Analyser (PP Systems).
- For most sites (FFU, FFB, BLF, WHF, TPP, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS): CPY-4 chamber mounted on collars; dark conditions to prevent photosynthesis; flux estimated from the slope of CO2 concentrations vs. time over 1.5–2 minutes; restart if initial vs final flux differed substantially; measurements sometimes repeated on the same day.
- For thawing features (TWMID, TWM, WTM, WTS, WTW): PVC chambers 15–35 cm high mounted on collars; inner tube used to seal and prevent leakage; enclosure time typically ≤ 3 minutes; regular interval CO2 concentrations recorded (≈ every 10 s).
- Headspace volume calculated from collar-ground distance; flux rates reported as mg CO2 day⁻¹ m⁻² or mg CO2-C day⁻¹ m⁻².
- Environmental data collection alongside flux measurements.

## Environmental variables measured
- Air temperature at the site.
- Soil temperature at 5 cm and 10 cm inside the collar after measuring flux.
- Volumetric soil moisture at the surface (upper 6 cm) using an ML3 ThetaKit.
- Thaw depth measured with a metal rod.
- Water table depth in thawing features, measured relative to a site datum established at season start with a long rod.

## Data processing and reporting
- Flux data coded to distinguish autotrophic vs autotrophic+heterotrophic respiration; note: flux data and soil core data originate from different locations; GPS coordinates exist in the data file.
- Example: soil profile information from soil core TPP1 does not spatially match flux data from TPP1.
- Intercept and R² from linear regression of concentration vs. time are reported where regression was used to estimate flux.

## Replication, quality assurance, and data notes
- Multiple replicates per site to capture variability.
- Quality checks include verifying that the initial and final flux values do not differ substantially; measurements may be restarted if needed.
- Boardwalks used to minimize disturbance during gas flux measurements.

## Temporal scope and limitations
- Data from summers 2013 and 2014.
- Some sites used different trenching histories; data compatibility across sites requires attention to methodological differences.
- Coded data may require careful reconciliation due to spatial mismatches between flux measurements and soil core data.
