# Autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration fluxes from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Measurements of CO2 respiration fluxes conducted during summers 2013 and 2014.
- Comparison targets: peatland plateau versus thawing features; unburnt versus burnt black spruce forests; additional sites included.
- Aimed at partitioning CO2 fluxes into autotrophic and heterotrophic components and understanding how thaw and fire influence soil respiration in subarctic permafrost regions.

## Sites and codes
- Fire-related status: FFU (FireFox Unburnt), FFB (FireFox Burnt), MCU (Mosquito Creek Unburnt), MCB (Mosquito Creek Burnt).
- Forest types: BLF (BlackFox), WHF (WhiteFox), BCB (Boundary Creek Birch), BCS (Boundary Creek Spruce), WTP (White Truck Plateau), WTM (White Truck Moss), WTS (White Truck Sedge), WTW (White Truck Wetland).
- Peatland features: TPP (Teslin Peatland Plateau), TWMID (Teslin Wetland Mid), TWM (Teslin Wetland Margin), WTP (White Truck Plateau), WTM (White Truck Moss), WTS (White Truck Sedge), WTW (White Truck Wetland).
- Notes: Site coordinates and classifications used to differentiate autotrophic vs heterotrophic flux measurements and thawing features.

## Measurement and sampling methods
- Collars and trenching to separate respiration components:
  - Heterotrophic respiration: PVC collars inserted into ground up to thaw depth (up to 40 cm); surface vegetation clipped; trenches used to minimize autotrophic contribution in many sites.
  - Autotrophic + heterotrophic respiration: PVC collars placed on ground surface; putty applied around collars to seal edges and reduce leakage.
- Replication: three to five replicates per site for each respiration type.
- Collar specifications (by site):
  - Autotrophic + heterotrophic: 160 mm diameter, 5 cm long (many sites); or 315 mm diameter, 10–15 cm long (TWMID, TWM, WTM, WTS) with 45 cm long depth for heterotrophic measurements.
  - Heterotrophic: 45 cm long collars (varies by site).
- Access and disturbance minimization: boardwalks constructed for thaw features.
- Flux measurement protocol:
  - Devices: EGM-4 Infrared Gas Analyzer (PP Systems) with CPY-4 chamber for many sites to ensure dark conditions (prevent photosynthesis).
  - Alternative chambers: PVC-enclosed chambers (15–35 cm high) for other sites to fit collar dimensions.
  - Enclosure duration: typically 1.5–2 minutes (CPY-4) or up to 3 minutes (PVC chambers).
  - Data processing: flux rates derived from the slope of CO2 concentration versus time; intercept and R2 reported where regression used.
  - Quality checks: measurement repeated if early and late flux rates differed substantially.
- Ancillary environmental measurements:
  - Air temperature from on-site weather station; soil temperature at 5 cm and 10 cm inside the collar after chamber removal.
  - Volumetric soil moisture at the surface (upper 6 cm) using ML3 ThetaKit.
  - Thaw depth: measured with a metal rod.
  - Water table depth: measured relative to a datum using a long rod.

## Data characteristics and notes
- Flux units: mg CO2 per day per m2 or mg CO2 carbon per day per m2.
- Data alignment caveat: autotrophic/heterotrophic flux coding aligns with soil profile data, but flux data and soil core data originate from different locations; GPS coordinates are provided in the dataset, and soil core example (TPP1) does not spatially match the corresponding flux location (TPP1).

## Data quality, governance, and metadata considerations
- Rigorous station setup and replication support robust monitoring of respiration components.
- Metadata considerations highlighted by the approach:
  - Clear documentation of site codes, collar dimensions, trenching status, and chamber configurations.
  - Explicit note on spatial mismatches between flux and soil core datasets to prevent misinterpretation.
  - Use of on-site meteorological data and soil measurements to support interpretation of flux results.
