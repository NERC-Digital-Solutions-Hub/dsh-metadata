# Autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration fluxes from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Purpose and scope
  - Measurements of CO2 respiration fluxes conducted during the summers of 2013 and 2014.
  - Comparisons across: peatland plateau vs thawing features, and unburnt vs burnt black spruce forests, with additional sites included.

  - TPP: Teslin Peatland Plateau

  - TWM: Teslin Wetland Margin (margin of thawed plateau)
  - MCU: Mosquito Creek Unburnt (unburnt black spruce)
  - MCB: Mosquito Creek Burnt (burnt black spruce)
  - WTP: White Truck Plateau (peatland plateau)
  - WTM: White Truck Moss (recently thawed plateau with moss)
  - WTS: White Truck Sedge (recently thawed plateau with sedge/moss)
  - WTW: White Truck Wetland (older thaw feature)
  - BCB: Boundary Creek Birch (birch forest)
  - BCS: Boundary Creek Spruce (black spruce forest)

- Experimental design and flux partitioning
  - Ground collars deployed to partition CO2 fluxes into:
    - Heterotrophic respiration (soil microbes/roots excluded or minimized)
    - Autotrophic+heterotrophic respiration (including plant/root contributions)
  - Strategies to minimize plant/root influence:
    - PVC collars inserted to thaw depth for heterotrophic measurements with surface vegetation clipped.
    - Trenched collar installations in many sites prior to measurements to reduce autotrophic input; timing varied by site (2012–2013 preps for 2013; 2013 for 2014; some sites trenched the same summer as measurement).
    - For autotrophic+heterotrophic measurements, PVC collars placed on the ground and edge sealed with putty to prevent leakage and root damage.
  - Replication: 3–5 replicates per site per respiration type.

- Collar dimensions and deployment
  - Autotrophic+heterotrophic respiration: typically 160 mm diameter, 5 cm long collars (some sites used 315 mm diameter with 10–15 cm length).
  - Heterotrophic respiration: 45 cm long collars (same diameter as autotrophic+heterotrophic) in most sites.
  - Some sites used larger collars (315 mm) for autotrophic+heterotrophic measurements.
  - Boardwalks constructed to access thawing features and minimize disturbance.

- Measurement methodology
  - Instrumentation: CO2 fluxes monitored with an EGM-4 Infrared Gas Analyzer (PP Systems).
  - Chamber configurations:
    - For most sites (FFU, FFB, BLF, WHF, TPP, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS): CPY-4 chamber with dark conditions to prevent photosynthesis.
    - For thawing-feature sites (TWMID, TWM, WTM, WTS): PVC chambers (15–35 cm high) placed on collars; inner tube secures to prevent leakage.
  - Procedure:
    - Chamber placed on collar; flux rate monitored for 1.5–2 minutes (or up to 3 minutes for taller chambers).
    - If initial vs final flux values differ substantially, measurement is restarted.
    - When feasible, multiple measurements are taken on the same day.
    - Enclosure times and intervals:
      - Regular CO2 concentration readings recorded (roughly every 10 seconds).
  - Volume calculations:
    - Headspace volume determined from collar-ground distance measurements.
  - Flux estimation:
    - Flux rates derived from the slope of CO2 concentration versus time (linear regression); intercept and R2 reported where applicable.
    - Reported units: mg CO2 per day per m2 or mg CO2-C per day per m2.
  - Ancillary environmental measurements:
    - Air temperature monitored at the site.
    - Soil temperature measured at 5 cm and 10 cm inside the collar after removing the chamber.
    - Volumetric soil moisture measured at the surface (upper 6 cm) with a ML3 ThetaKit (Delta-T Devices) using standard calibration.
    - Thaw depth recorded with a metal rod (depth corresponding to soil resistance).
    - Water table depth measured in thawing features using a reference datum established with a long rod at season start.

- Data relationships and notes
  - Flux coding for autotrophic vs heterotrophic respiration aligns with data in the soil profiles dataset, but flux data and soil core data originate from different locations; GPS coordinates are provided in the data files.
  - Example: soil profile information from soil core TPP1 does not spatially match the flux data from TPP1.

- Implications for environmental monitoring and data use
  - Provides a standardized, multi-site dataset on soil respiration dynamics across peatland plateaus and thawing features under different forest disturbance histories.
  - Enables cross-site comparisons of autotrophic and heterotrophic contributions to CO2 fluxes in subarctic permafrost environments.
  - The methodological rigor (replication, trenching to reduce root inputs, dark chamber conditions, QA on flux calculation) supports data quality for monitoring environmental health and carbon-cycle policy performance over time.
  - The dataset is amenable to synthesis with other data streams to enhance the value of monitoring efforts and to facilitate access to underlying raw measurements.
