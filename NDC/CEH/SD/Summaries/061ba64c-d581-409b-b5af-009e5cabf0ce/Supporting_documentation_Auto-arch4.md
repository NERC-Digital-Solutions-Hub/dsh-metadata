# Autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration fluxes from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Measurements of CO2 respiration fluxes conducted during summers 2013 and 2014.
- Comparison across peatland plateaus vs thawing features, and burnt vs unburnt black spruce forests, with additional sites included.
- Aimed at partitioning fluxes into heterotrophic soil respiration and autotrophic+heterotrophic respiration, across a diverse set of sites.

## Study design and sites
- Site codes include FFU (FireFox Unburnt), FFB (FireFox Burnt), BLF (BlackFox), WHF (WhiteFox), TPP (Teslin Peatland Plateau), TWMID (Teslin Wetland Mid), TWM (Teslin Wetland Margin), MCU (Mosquito Creek Unburnt), MCB (Mosquito Creek Burnt), WTP (White Truck Plateau), WTM (White Truck Moss), WTS (White Truck Sedge), WTW (White Truck Wetland), BCB (Boundary Creek Birch), BCS (Boundary Creek Spruce).
- At each site, ground collars were used to separate heterotrophic respiration (collected with deeper PVC collars after trenching) from autotrophic+heterotrophic respiration (surface collars).
- Three to five replicates per site for each respiration type.
- Distinct trenching and collar installation timing: in many sites, trenching occurred in prior years (2012–2013) to reduce autotrophic signals; in others, trenching occurred the same year as measurements.

## Field methods
- Collars: PVC collars with species- and site-specific dimensions (e.g., 160 mm diameter with varying lengths; some sites used 315 mm diameter and longer lengths).
- For autotrophic+heterotrophic respiration, collars placed on ground surface; for heterotrophic respiration, collars embedded to soil depth with trenches cut to minimize plant/root effects; putty used to seal edges.
- Replicates: three to five collars per respiration type per site.
- Access: boardwalks constructed to minimize disturbance during gas flux measurements.
- Gas flux measurements: using EGM-4 Infrared Gas Analyzer (PP Systems) with CPY-4 chambers for many sites to enforce dark conditions and suppress photosynthesis.
- Measurement protocol: fluxes estimated from 1.5–2 minutes (or up to 3 minutes for some sites) of enclosure, with flux rate calculated from the slope of CO2 concentration versus time; checks on initial vs final rates to ensure stability; repeats performed when feasible.
- Headspace and volume: distance from collar edge to ground measured to calculate headspace volume; for some sites, PVC tubes with inner tubes used to secure enclosure and prevent leaks.
- Temperature and moisture measurements: on-site air temperature; soil temperature at 5 cm and 10 cm inside collars; soil volumetric moisture at surface (top 6 cm) with a ThetaKit ML3; thaw depth measured with a metal rod; water table depth relative to a fixed datum.
- Data handling: fluxes reported as mg CO2 day^-1 m^-2 or mg CO2-C day^-1 m^-2; accompanying regression metrics (intercept, R^2) recorded where applicable.

## Measurements and calculations
- Flux calculation: slopes of linear regressions of CO2 concentration vs time used to estimate flux rates.
- Temperature and moisture variables accompany flux data to contextualize flux dynamics.
- Thaw depth and water table depth provide hydrologic context for permafrosted peatland dynamics.
- Flux and soil core data may be coded consistently within datasets but originate from different locations; GPS coordinates are provided, and spatial mismatches between soil core data and flux data are acknowledged.

## Data management notes and caveats
- Important caveat: autotrophic and heterotrophic flux data and soil core data do not spatially coincide; spatial coordinates in the dataset may not line up across data types (e.g., soil profile TPP1 vs flux data at TPP1).
- Documentation emphasizes the need to refer to GPS coordinates for proper data alignment and interpretation.
- The dataset supports cross-site comparisons of respiration modes across peatland and forest types under thawing and permafrost conditions, with robust metadata on measurement methods and site conditions.

## Implications for data governance (Data Leaders perspective)
- Comprehensive metadata and transparent methods support data discoverability and reusability across networks studying carbon flux in subarctic ecosystems.
- Variations in collar design, trenching history, and measurement protocols across sites highlight the importance of standardized data standards, provenance, and clear metadata to enable integration.
- Noting data gaps and potential coordination needs across research teams can guide the development of stronger communities of practice for soil respiration data.
- Data users should account for spatial mismatches between flux data and soil core data when performing integrative analyses or cross-dataset modeling.
