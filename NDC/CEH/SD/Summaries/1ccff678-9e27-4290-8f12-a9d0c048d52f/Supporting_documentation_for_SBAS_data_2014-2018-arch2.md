# Supporting Document Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from South Basin of Windermere 2014 to 2018

## Overview
- Ongoing fortnightly monitoring in the South Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Variables measured: surface temperature (TEMP, °C); surface oxygen saturation (OXYG, % air saturation); Secchi depth (SECC, m); alkalinity (ALKA, µg CaCO3 per L); pH; ammonium (NH4N, µg N per L); nitrate (NO3N, µg N per L); soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P, µg P per L); total phosphorus (TOTP, µg P per L); dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2, µg per L); phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA, µg per L).
- Water sample integrated from 0 to 7 m; measurements taken from a boat at the deepest part of the lake (buoy).
- Timeframe: January 2014 – end of 2018.
- Data format: raw data available for download in CSV format with Date, Variable, Value, and Sign (if<LOD) columns.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Frequency: fortnightly sampling.
- Location and depth: South Basin, Windermere; deepest part; integrated 0–7 m sample; collected from a boat at a buoy.
- Data structure: clearly defined variable names, units, and description for each measurement.

## Quality control
- Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data attributed to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Data structure and content
- File format: CSV with columns including Date, Description (measurement date), Variable (e.g., TEMP, OXYG, SECC, etc.), Value, and Sign (indicating below detection limit when present).
- Variable descriptions and units:
  - TEMP: surface temperature, °C
  - OXYG: surface oxygen saturation, % air-saturation
  - SECC: Secchi depth, m
  - ALKA: alkalinity, µg CaCO3 per L
  - pH: pH units
  - NH4N: ammonium, µg N per L
  - NO3N: nitrate, µg N per L
  - PO4P: soluble reactive phosphate, µg P per L
  - TOTP: total phosphorus, µg P per L
  - SIO2: dissolved reactive silicon, µg per L
  - TOCA: phytoplankton chlorophyll a, µg per L
- Sign column: indicates when values are below detection limit with a < sign.

## Data availability, access and management
- Funded by Natural Environment Research Council (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
- Dataset used in recent publications (examples include climate state reports, storm impact studies, and ecological monitoring papers).
- Aims align with standardised environmental monitoring: data are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals; raw data are provided for downstream QA, cleansing, and integration with other datasets.

## Practical relevance for environmental analysts
- Provides a long-term, high-frequency (fortnightly) time series of key limnological variables for Windermere’s South Basin (2014–2018).
- Enables assessment of spatial-temporal trends in physical, chemical, and biological water quality indicators.
- Supports cross-dataset integration to evaluate environmental health against standards and policy performance over time.
- Data can be linked with other datasets to enhance multi-source analyses and early-warning indicators for ecosystem change.
- Considerations for use include applying quality-control procedures, documenting detection-limit handling via the Sign field, and ensuring data are accessible through appropriate portals for broader use and reuse.
