## Overview
- Ongoing monitoring dataset for the South Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Fortnightly sampling from 2014 to 2018.
- Measured variables: surface temperature (TEMP), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG), Secchi depth (SECC), alkalinity (ALKA), pH, ammonium (NH4N), nitrate (NO3N), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P), total phosphorus (TOTP), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA).
- Samples integrated from 0 to 7 m; collected from a boat at the deepest part of the lake (buoy location).

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Data available to download as CSV with:
  - Date of measurement
  - Variable descriptions
  - Values (with units as specified)
  - Sign indicators for values below detection limit
- Nature of collection: field measurements from a fixed buoy at the lake’s deepest point.
- Timeframe: January 2014 through the end of 2018.

## Quality Control
- Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data quality steps performed: double entry and visual checks.
- Missing data attributed to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Data structure and content
- File format: comma-separated values (CSV).
- Core columns:
  - Date: date of measurement
  - Variable, Description: name and description of each measured parameter
  - Value, Description: measured value (with units)
  - Sign (if<LOD), Description: indicates values below detection limit
- Variables and units (as listed in the dataset):

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Provides a multi-parameter, long-term, lake-monitoring dataset suitable for evaluating environmental health indicators and informing policy decisions.
- Highlights practical considerations for monitoring frameworks:
  - Data accessibility and openness (raw data, forthcoming quality control)
  - Metadata and documentation needs (definition of detection limits, units, sampling depths)
  - Data governance and standardization (consistency across variables and time)
  - Potential data gaps due to weather or staffing, and the need for robust QA/QC processes
  - Importance of transparent sharing and clear communication of complex findings via reports or dashboards
