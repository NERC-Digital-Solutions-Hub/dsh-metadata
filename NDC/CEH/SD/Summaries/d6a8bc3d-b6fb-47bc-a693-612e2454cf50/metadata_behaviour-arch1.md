# Experimental design/collection method:

- Objective
  - Assess the social status achieved by each form of Maculinea rebeli within colonies of each Myrmica species in a standard bioassay.

- Experimental subjects and setup
  - Groups of five butterfly larvae from each region adopted into matching colonies of naïve French Myrmica schencki and Myrmica sabuleti.
  - Each test colony also contained five kin ant pupae, large larvae, and small larvae (total 20 immature individuals) and 20 workers.
  - Lab culture setup: small moist sponge pad beneath an inverted 6 cm diameter saucer with a notched entrance; ants gathered brood and M. rebeli.

- Experimental procedure
  - Three hours after introduction of M. rebeli caterpillars, perturb brood chamber by relocating it to a nearby pad; record the order in which nurse ants rescued 15 brood items or the five M. rebeli and carried them to the new nest.
  - Repeat the same procedure seven days later, allowing M. rebeli to reach maximum potential integration while remaining similar in size to host pupae/larvae.
  - Replicates varied due to occasional missing ants or butterfly deaths (especially with unnatural hosts).

- Data storage and file structure
  - Data stored in eight CSV files named by experiment and timing:
    - Behaviour_switch_3hexp1.csv, Behaviour_switch_7dexp1.csv, Behaviour_switch_3hexp2.csv, Behaviour_switch_7dexp2.csv, Behaviour_switch_3hexp3.csv, Behaviour_switch_7dexp3.csv, Behaviour_switch_3hexp4.csv, Behaviour_switch_7dexp4.csv.

- Data headers and meaning
  - Columns include: Spain M. rebeli, Polish M. rebeli, M. sabuleti, M. schencki, Nest no., order_7day exp, order_3h exp, Ant pupae, Large larvae, Small larvae, M. rebeli.
  - Retrieval ranks range 1–18 for each category; nr indicates not retrieved.
  - Order variables: 7-day experiment is numbered as 2 for statistical analysis; 3-hour experiment is numbered as 1.

- Interpretation and potential analyses
  - Data enable comparison of social prioritization and integration of Maculinea rebeli across host species and regions.
  - Facilitates analysis of host vs. parasite retrieval order under different temporal contexts (3 hours vs 7 days) and cross-regional variation.

- Notes on data quality
  - Replicate count varied due to data gaps (missing ants or butterfly losses).
  - Data are organised to support cross-treatment and cross-host analyses, with explicit handling of non-retrieved cases.
