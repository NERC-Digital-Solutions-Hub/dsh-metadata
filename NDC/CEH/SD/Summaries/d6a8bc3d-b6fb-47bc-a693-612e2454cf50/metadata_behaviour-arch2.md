# Experimental design/collection method:

## Experimental design and organisms
- Objective: assess the social status achieved by Maculinea rebeli within colonies of two Myrmica species using a standardized bioassay.
- Butterfly larvae origin: groups from Spain and Poland.
- Host ants: Myrmica schencki and Myrmica sabuleti (French colonies used as naïve hosts).
- In each replicate: 5 butterfly larvae, 5 kin ant pupae, large and small larvae (total 20 immatures) and 20 worker ants.

## Experimental setup and environment
- Laboratory colonies established on a small moist sponge pad under an inverted 6 cm dish with a notched entrance.
- Brood and Maculinea rebeli caterpillars placed under the nest with the ants.

## Experimental procedure
- Perturbation: 3 hours after introduction, relocate the brood chamber to a nearby pad.
- Observation: record the order in which the nurse ants rescue their 15 brood items or the 5 Maculinea rebeli and move them to the new nest.
- Replication timing: same experiment repeated seven days later to allow ample integration; caterpillar size similar to or smaller than host pupae/larvae at that time.
- Variability: number of replicates varied due to availability of ants and caterpillars (deaths, shortages).

## Data storage and format
- Data stored as eight CSV files named:
  - Behaviour_switch_3hexp1.csv
  - Behaviour_switch_7dexp1.csv
  - Behaviour_switch_3hexp2.csv
  - Behaviour_switch_7dexp2.csv
  - Behaviour_switch_3hexp3.csv
  - Behaviour_switch_7dexp3.csv
  - Behaviour_switch_3hexp4.csv
  - Behaviour_switch_7dexp4.csv
- Each file corresponds to results recorded either three hours after introduction (3h) or seven days after introduction (7d) in the first through fourth behaviour switch experiments.

## Data headers and variables
- Species/region identifiers:
  - Spain M. rebeli
  - Polish M. rebeli
  - M. sabuleti (host ant)
  - M. schencki (host ant)
- Nest no. (nest identifier)
- Experimental timing:
  - order_7day exp (coded as 2 for statistical analysis)
  - order_3h exp (coded as 1 for statistical analysis)
- Retrieval order variables (rankings 1–18):
  - Ant pupae
  - Large larvae
  - Small larvae
  - M. rebeli
- M. rebeli and host items' retrieval order is determined by nurse ant attention.
- Note: nr = not retrieved

## Replication and timeline
- Two time points per replicate: three hours post-introduction and seven days post-introduction.
- Four separate behaviour-switch experiments conducted (1–4) with corresponding 3h and 7d data.

## Data interpretation and use
- Retrieval order indicates relative social priority given to brood vs. Maculinea rebeli within host colonies.
- Data are designed for cross-regional comparisons (Spain vs. Poland) and across host species (M. schencki vs. M. sabuleti).

## Data accessibility and notes
- Data are organized for standardized analysis with explicit headers describing each column.
- nr indicates that an item was not retrieved during the observation.
