# Description

- This deposit provides fluvial flood maps for the present day at a 1 in 20 year return period and corresponding flood extents for three SSP/RCP future scenarios for 2070–2100.
- Future change in flood return periods is estimated using CMIP6 projections and used to select flood maps from the global flood model.

## What this dataset contains

- Present-day flood maps: 1 in 20 year return period (depth in metres).
- Future flood maps: 1 in 20 year return period (for the three SSP/RCP scenarios) for 2070–2100.
- The future maps are generated by transforming CMIP6-based return periods to the nearest available return period within the Fathom 2.0 framework and extracting corresponding flood extents.
- The data cover Vietnam and are provided as GeoTIFF files, plus a readme document.

## Data generation and model methods

- Flood maps were generated with Fathom 2.0, an updated global flood model (Sampson et al. 2015).
- Updates include: estimation of river channel conveyance capacity (Neal et al., 2021) and an improved elevation dataset (MERIT DEM; Yamazaki et al., 2017).
- Future return periods are based on CMIP6 projections (Hirabayashi et al., 2021).
- Present-day 1 in 20 year return period is used as the baseline for deriving future maps.

## Data contents and structure

- There are 4 GeoTIFF files and 1 readme document in the record.
- File names (Vietnam, ISO3 code VNM):
  - VNM_1in20.tif: present-day flood depth for 1 in 20 year event.
  - VNM_ssp5rcp85_20.tif: future 1 in 20 year flood depth under SSP5/RCP8.5.
  - VNM_ssp2rcp45_20.tif: future 1 in 20 year flood depth under SSP2/RCP4.5.
  - VNM_ssp1rcp26_20.tif: future 1 in 20 year flood depth under SSP1/RCP2.6.
- File sizes are approximately 4.6–5.5 MB per GeoTIFF.

## Experimental design and processing

- Future return periods from Hirabayashi et al. (2021) are mapped to the nearest available return period in the Fathom 2.0 set (5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 200, 250, 500, 1000).
- The corresponding flood inundation map for each return period is extracted and mosaicked across Vietnam.

## Analytical methods

- Present-day maps can be evaluated against observations (remote sensing, photographs, newspapers, wrack marks).
- Skill metrics that can be computed include critical success index (CSI), hit rate, false alarm ratio, and bias.

## Use in GIS and recommended practices

- For visualization, open GeoTIFFs in GIS software (e.g., QGIS, ArcMap).
- Important: a value of 0 indicates 0 m flood depth. Recommend treating 0 as no-data or starting the color palette at a threshold above zero (e.g., 0.1 m) to emphasize flooded areas.
- Spatial and statistical analyses are well-suited to use in R or Python.

## Limitations and scope

- Maps depict fluvial (riverine) flooding only; pluvial (rain-related) and coastal flooding are not included.
- No flood defenses are explicitly modeled or included.
- Future maps rely on CMIP6 projections and the present-day 1 in 20 year baseline; uncertainties exist in projections and downscaling.

## Data provenance, quality, and references

- The Fathom 2.0 model has been used in multiple publications (e.g., Bernhofen et al., Hawker et al., Mitchell et al., Rentschler et al.).
