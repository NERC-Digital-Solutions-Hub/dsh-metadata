# An Integrated Assessment of Countryside Survey data to investigate Ecosystem Services in Great Britain

## Biodiversity as a cultural ecosystem service
- Defines biodiversity as a cultural ecosystem service via the concept of "appropriate diversity"—the value placed on certain species or groups within nature conservation contexts.
- Preliminary quantification uses Countryside Survey (CS) plant abundance data linked to UK Priority Habitats indicators (Common Standards Monitoring, CSM) to assess conservation value across the countryside.
- Across CS Broad Habitats (except Arable and Horticulture), there is a decline in appropriate diversity from 1998 to 2007, aligning with broader declines in plant species diversity and a shift towards competitive, less-disturbed vegetation.
- Declines are most pronounced in small patches within larger Broad Habitats (Targeted Plots) and in lowland agricultural and woodland habitats; some increases observed in certain arable/ horticulture contexts.
- Drivers of change at the landscape level are not consistent; no single square-level driver (e.g., climate or deposition) explains changes well. At the plot level, changes relate to productivity gradients and successional dynamics (reduced disturbance/management associated with diversity loss; some habitat-specific exceptions).
- Sheep grazing shows a negative association with nectar-diversity in upland heath, but time-interactions are not consistently significant; early uptake of agri-environment schemes (ELS) did not show clear effects within 1998–2007 due to timing/data resolution.
- Mapping appropriate diversity with CSM indicator species is possible in principle but faces methodological limitations: many CSM species occur in designated sites and are underrepresented in unbiased CS squares; extrapolating across all CS squares reduces spatial sensitivity.
- Policy relevance: potential to inform biodiversity and agri-environment policy design, but attribution to specific management actions requires higher-resolution, targeted data and robust methods.

## Contribution of Countryside Survey integrated assessment
- Introduces appropriate diversity as a measurable cultural service and tests its spatial distribution using CS data and CSM indicators.
- Finds declines in appropriate diversity across most Broad Habitats (1998–2007), consistent with overall CS trends and succession toward less-disturbed conditions.
- Demonstrates challenges in attributing observed changes to specific drivers or agri-environment schemes due to data limitations, emphasizing the need for finer-scale management history data.

## Data integration, outputs, and mapping
- The integrated assessment combines fixed-location CS ecological data with climate, deposition, and land-use covariates to examine biodiversity-based cultural services and potential futures.
- Explores mapping of appropriate diversity and related cultural-service indicators, highlighting both potential outputs (predictive maps, scenario testing) and current limitations related to data resolution and spatial sensitivity.
- Related chapters show broader integration of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and landscape appreciation (e.g., mapping of charismatic landscapes and landscape complexity) to link biophysical indicators with cultural and experiential values.

## Data collection, management, and gaps
- A key data gap is high-resolution, location-specific data on agri-environment management interventions and their positive environmental effects; current data limit robust attribution analyses.
- Data compatibility and consistency across UK countries are needed to enable robust, multi-scale analyses and policy-relevant evidence.
- Emphasis on the need for standardized time-series data and better coordination of explanatory variables across scales to strengthen attribution and policy insights.

## Policy context and decisions influencing data needs
- EU Water Framework Directive and ecosystem-approach policy context underline the value of integrating biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services for water quality and broader sustainability.
- Policy implications include the design of future CAP reforms and land-use planning that balance biodiversity, pollination, soil carbon storage, and production goals.
- The study underscores the importance of considering landscape-scale interactions and trade-offs when informing policy, rather than focusing solely on designated sites.

## Future work and data recommendations
- Develop higher-resolution data on agri-environment management practices, including positive environmental effects, to improve attribution in ecosystem-service analyses.
- Extend analyses to additional ecosystem services and habitats, and pursue ensemble modelling to better capture multi-service dynamics.
- Improve mapping to capture fine-scale spatial variation and to mitigate sampling biases, enabling more robust policy guidance.
- Foster interdisciplinary collaboration among natural scientists, economists, and social scientists to develop common approaches to measuring and valuing ecosystem services and to support decision-making.
- Integrate CS outputs with other initiatives (e.g., ALARM) and include into national policy-relevant systems like the UK NEA to strengthen evidence bases for decision-making.

## Data support takeaways
- The Countryside Survey integrated assessment demonstrates how fixed-location, multi-domain ecological data can be harmonised with climate, deposition, and land-use datasets to quantify status, change, and potential futures for ecosystem services at a GB scale.
- Produces data products and tools (integrated databases, model-based and map-based outputs, scenario testing) enabling self-serve exploration, policy-relevant insights, and targeted monitoring.
- Highlights data gaps (notably high-resolution positive-management data, lag effects, and causality) and the importance of scale-appropriate analyses when interpreting ecosystem-service relationships.
