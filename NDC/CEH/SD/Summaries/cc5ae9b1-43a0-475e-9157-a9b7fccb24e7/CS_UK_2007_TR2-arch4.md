# CS Technical Report No.2/07: Vegetation Plots Handbook

## Purpose and Scope
- Describes standardized methods for recording vegetation plots to enable repeatable, long-term datasets documenting vegetation changes over time.
- Aims to maintain a globally unique, four-point time series across nearly three decades.
- Combines header data, plot photos, and maps with a digital data capture system (Vegplots) and GIS (ArcMap).

## Data Collection Framework
- For each plot, collect:
  - General header information (plot type, number, height, etc.), plot relocation data, and administrative notes.
  - Plot photos for relocation reference and trend illustration.
  - Plot maps (paper and digital) integrated with ArcMap for precise relocation.
- Digital data capture begins in 2007 with Vegplots; photos stored in a structured directory on tablets.
- GPS logging: tablets provide GPS coordinates; surveyors stamp and label GPS locations on the map for future relocation.
- Data entry workflow requires locating the plot in ArcMap, then opening Vegplots to enter standard recording data, with validation and saving steps.

## Plot Types and Sampling Design
- Multiple plot types, each with specific purposes and sizes:
  - X PLOTS (Large, 200 m2; Wally plots) – random samples of common vegetation types.
  - Y PLOTS (Small, 2 m x 2 m; habitat-focused) – target habitats and Priority Habitats (PH) in 2007.
  - U PLOTS (Unenclosed, 2 m x 2 m) – representative unenclosed broad habitats; up to 10 per square.
  - A PLOTS (Arable field margins) – 100 x 1 m margins adjacent to arable fields.
  - M PLOTS (Margins) – 6 m wide margins associated with cross-compliance habitats in arable fields.
  - H PLOTS (Hedgerows) – hedgerow plots, 10 m x 1 m, on woody features.
  - D PLOTS (Hedgerow diversity) – 30 m length plots to assess woody feature diversity and condition.
  - S PLOTS/W PLOTS (Streamside) – linear plots along water features; 10 m x 1 m.
  - R PLOTS/V PLOTS (Roadside and Verge) – 10 m x 1 m plots along roadsides and verges.
- Some plots are co-located or placed to represent habitat diversity; measurements and placement rules emphasize minimal disturbance and consistent canopy/edge definitions.
- Each plot type has its own header, species recording approach, and nesting structure for data capture.

## Data Entry and Recording (Vegplots)
- Start by locating the plot in ArcMap, then launch Vegplots to access the Standard Recording screen.
- Top header shows Square, Plot Type, Plot Number, and Plot ID (constructed from square, type, and number).
- Headers tab: includes Plot Relocation status, Plate detection, Plot ID references, slope, aspect, shade, photos, and map status.
- Listed Species: comprehensive groups (Common, Grasses, Ferns, Forbs/Woody, Bryophytes/Lichens, etc.) with tick-box selection; Unidentified species allowed for later verification.
- Selected Species: builds a nested species list with estimated total cover for each species; 5% cover bands; includes a Delete option for rows.
- Nest concept: multi-level nested plots (e.g., inner 4 m2 nest and outer nests) for X plots; 1 m2 nest for large sampling.
- Completion workflow: regular saves, validation checks that highlight missing fields, and a final Save/Exit step after validation.
- Plot photos: take repeatable reference photos to aid relocation; upload photos to the tablet file system after fieldwork.

## Plot Relocation and GPS Protocols
- Relocation uses ArcMap maps, on-screen photos, and GPS as an aid; precise relocation is essential for repeatability.
- For not found plots or new features, create a new plot entry with appropriate replacement status.
- GPS logging: non-differential GPS used on tablets; coordinates stamped on the map with labels indicating plot type and number.

## Plot Map Protocols and Documentation
- Plot maps must be clear and precise, created with available measuring tools; where necessary, use reasonable skyline features for bearings.
- If reusing existing maps, indicate whether edited or redrawn; new plots require clear sketches with measurements and bearings.
- Plot maps accompany each square; new plots should be labeled with updated square/plot identifiers to prevent misclassification as repeats.
- Detailed plotting schemes for each plot type define placement, boundary relations, and spacing constraints (e.g., at least 10 m separation for linear plots).

## Data Quality, Validation, and Compliance
- Validation checks in Vegplots enforce required fields; red flags indicate missing header data or selected species data.
- Photos and maps serve as audit trails for relocation and habitat assessment.
- The protocol emphasizes avoiding disturbance while ensuring comprehensive recording of vegetation and nest-specific data.

## Data Management, Storage, and Access
- Data are stored in Vegplots databases on tablets; two datasets (VegetationPlotsA.mdb and VegetationPlotsB.mdb) to prevent cross-over when using two tablets.
- Uploading and data synchronization procedures are provided during training.
- The document underscores data reuse for time-series analysis and cross-survey comparability, with standardized metadata and naming conventions.

## Challenges and Considerations
- Field conditions require judgement on plot relocation accuracy and eligibility, especially for rare or boundary habitats.
- Coordination across survey teams is essential to maintain consistent plot numbering, placement, and data entry.
- The framework anticipates updates and expansion (e.g., new habitat types, revised plot allocations) and provides mechanisms to accommodate changes.

## Concluding Notes
- The Vegetation Plots Handbook provides a comprehensive, standardized methodology for collecting, recording, and managing vegetation plot data.
- It supports rigorous longitudinal analyses by ensuring repeatable plot relocation, consistent data capture, and robust metadata, backed by digital tools (Vegplots) and GIS integration (ArcMap).
