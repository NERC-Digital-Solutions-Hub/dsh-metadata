# CS Technical Report No.2/07: Vegetation Plots Handbook

- A comprehensive manual for recording vegetation presence and abundance across a range of plot types in Countryside Survey, with a strong emphasis on repeatability, data capture via tablets, GIS integration, and standardized metadata to support long-term environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Purpose and scope
- Enables monitoring of environmental health through a globally unique, long-term vegetation dataset.
- Documents four survey points over the last 29 years to track fine-grained, large-scale vegetation change.
- Specifies mandatory data to be collected for each plot (header, photos, maps, and species data) and supports future policy scrutiny and decision-making.

## Data collection framework and workflow
- Dual data systems: GIS (ArcMap) for plot location and map management; VegPlots tablet software for standardised data entry.
- Key data elements per plot:
  - Header: plot number/type, plot height, slope, aspect, shade, photos, plot maps.
  - GPS coordinates and plot location logging on the map during recording.
  - Listed and selected species with presence/absence and percent cover (5% bands), plus nested plot structure where applicable.
- Workflow sequence:
  - Locate or establish plot in ArcMap; start VegPlots to record plot data.
  - Enter header information, then list and select species.
  - Validate data, save progress, and exit; collect and download associated plot photos.

## Plot relocation, addition, and management of duplicates
- Plot relocation: adjust ArcMap positions if landscape references change; GPS position should not be moved in isolation.
- If a plot cannot be relocated satisfactorily, record as Not Found and create a new plot (replacement or new feature).
- New plots arise from missing plots, new squares, land-use changes, or as required by plot-type rules.
- New plots must be distinctly labeled (e.g., Y6, U7) to avoid treating them as repeats.
- Plot maps and photos serve as relocation aids; back-ups stored in dedicated folders.

## GIS integration and data governance
- All plotting data are anchored to ArcMap plots with unique identifiers (Square, Plot Type, Plot Number, Plot ID).
- Tablets host dual datasets (A and B) to prevent overwriting when two technicians record in parallel; files are saved as VegetationPlotsA.mdb and VegetationPlotsB.mdb.
- Plot maps must be clear and precise; edits should be documented (hand-drawn edits or redrawn maps) and clearly annotated.
- Plot photos are used for relocation and illustrating vegetation change; photos must include plot number and type.

## Plot types and sampling design (overview)
- Areal plots (A): long, narrow plots along arable margins (approx. 100 m long x 1 m wide) adjacent to Boundary plots.
- X plots — Large or “Wally” plots (200 m²): 14.14 m x 14.14 m square with nested 4 m² and additional nested plots; random positioning with five-sector guidance for replacements.
- Y plots — Small, targeted habitats (2 m x 2 m): placed in Habitat patches and Priority Habitats not sampled by other plots; random selection across patches when multiple PHs exist.
- U plots — Unenclosed Broad Habitats (2 m x 2 m): allocated according to the proportion of unenclosed habitat within a square; up to 10 plots per square with allocation proportional to area.
- S/W plots — Streamside or Waterside plots (10 m x 1 m): placed along rivers/canals/streams to capture linear habitat along watercourses.
- R/V plots — Roadsides and Verges (10 m x 1 m): located along verges and roadside features; documenting edge effects and habitat along transport corridors.
- H plots — Hedgerow plots (10 m x 1 m): positioned along hedgerows; if hedges disappear, relocate to nearest suitable hedge.
- D plots — Hedgerow diversity plots: dedicated to woody species diversity and hedgerow condition; longer 30 m plots centered on hedgerow features.
- M plots — Margins (2 m x 2 m): arable field margins associated with cross-compliance margins and margin options; multiple plots placed at specified intervals from hedge centers.
- A plots — Arable field margins adjacent to arable land (100 m x 1 m): extending from Boundary plots into the field; up to 5 plots per square.
- B plots — Boundary plots: aligned with 200 m² plots along field boundaries; focus on boundary features (hedge, fence, ditch, etc.)
- Sphagna notes for bryophyte considerations are included within species protocols.

## Plot recording and data entry (VegPlots)
- Data entry starts from ArcMap: select the plot and open VegPlots standard recording screen.
- Header section includes: plot relocation status, plate detection, plot ID, slope, aspect, shade, photos, and plot maps status (edited/redrawn).
- Listed species: comprehensive lists by group (Common, Grasses, Ferns, Forbs/Woody, Bryophytes/Lichens, Unidentified species); allow partial identifications for field collection.
- Selected species: builds a growing list with nest numbers; enter total cover for each species in 5% bands; ensure no double counting of canopy layers; include woody species when their canopy projects over the plot.
- Validation and saving: use Validate to identify missing fields; save progress frequently; exit only after validation.
- Photos and relocation notes: mandatory per plot to aid relocation and illustrate trends; attach and download photos per square after completion.

## Plot-specific protocols and header fields (highlights)
- X plots: multi-nest nested sampling; soil and habitat details captured; central 4 m² nest and outer nests recorded; random selection of subplots and total cover across all nests.
- Y plots: capture Priority Habitat representation; record PH designation and species presence across nested 2 m x 2 m plots.
- U plots: document unenclosed Broad Habitats with habitat-specific metadata; relocation and random allocation guided by habitat distribution.
- S/W plots: record stream type, watercourse condition, width, freeboard, and along-watercourse placement.
- R/V plots: record road/ verge specifics; plot edge starting at interface of soil and road surface; document road type.
- H and D plots: record hedgerow features, gappiness, height, and diversity; D plots capture woody species diversity in hedgerows.
- A and M plots: margins alongside arable fields; log distance from boundary, margin type, and presence/cover of vegetation forming tussocks.
- B plots: boundary feature measurements and associated species data; ensure correct positioning relative to X plots.
- Aggregations: where taxa identification is difficult, use pre-agreed taxonomic combinations to preserve cross-year comparability.
- Bryophytes and Lichens: limited to listed bryophytes and lichens; detailed Sphagnum forms recorded where relevant.

## Data quality, metadata, and governance
- Emphasis on repeatability, metadata sufficiency, and clear documentation to enable verification, re-use, and cross-year comparability.
- Data sharing and governance are central: outputs should be shareable with appropriate provenance; strict data management standards at data origin.
- Backups, data validation, and clear protocols ensure quality and openness in accordance with Countryside Survey standards.

## Endnote: purpose, dissemination, and stewardship
- Countryside Survey in 2007: a government partnership-driven effort to monitor environmental health; data used to scrutinise current policy and inform future decisions.
- Outputs include detailed plot maps, species data, and habitat assessments intended for policy evaluation, trend analysis, and landscape-scale environmental health reporting.
