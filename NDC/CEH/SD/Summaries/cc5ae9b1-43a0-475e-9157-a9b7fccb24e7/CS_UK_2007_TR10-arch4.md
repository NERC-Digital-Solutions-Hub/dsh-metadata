# An Integrated Assessment of Countryside Survey data to investigate Ecosystem Services in Great Britain

- Executive overview
  - The Countryside Survey (CS) integrated assessment links long-term, GB-wide data to ecosystem services, introducing “appropriate diversity” as a cultural ecosystem service indicator derived from CS plant abundance data linked to UK Priority Habitats.
  - Key findings show declines in appropriate diversity across most Broad Habitats between 1998 and 2007, alongside a broader trend of diversification and succession toward more competitive, less-disturbed vegetation.
  - Mapping appropriate diversity using CS and CSM Indicator species faces methodological limits due to sampling design and the bias of indicator species toward designated areas; full spatial extrapolation remains challenging.
  - Drivers such as climate warming since 1980 and reduced nitrogen deposition relate to changes in appropriate diversity, but explanatory power is uneven; high-resolution management history data are needed to improve attribution.

- Data architecture, assets and integration
  - CS provides fixed-location, long-term data across GB with 1 km square sampling; integrated assessment combines CS data with climate, deposition, hydrology and land-use information.
  - Broad Habitats and other habitat classifications underpin comparisons across contexts; indicators span biodiversity, landscapes and ecosystem services, including cultural services like landscape quality.
  - The integration supports modelling and mapping to explore status, drivers, and potential futures, though cross-country data harmonisation remains a challenge.

- Findings relevant to data leadership
  - Appropriate diversity declines indicate landscapes with insufficient disturbance or management and a shift toward shading and succession; policy implications depend on landscape mosaics and habitat interconnectivity.
  - Relationships between diversity indicators and drivers are not consistently explainable by single factors; multi-scale spatial analyses and richer management histories improve interpretation.
  - Landscape-scale nectar diversity suggests potential reliance on small, diverse patches or linear habitats; large-scale policy instruments (e.g., agri-environment schemes) require finer-resolution data to attribute effects accurately.

- Data gaps, governance and stewardship
  - Positive management data (e.g., agri-environment scheme histories) are sparse or inaccessible, hindering attribution analyses and underrepresenting beneficial effects.
  - Social and management-context indicators at square-level are scarce; cross-sector data integration remains difficult due to variability across UK countries.
  - Underrepresented habitats and limited sample sizes constrain some indicators; differences between CS and designated-site monitoring complicate comparability.
  - A clear need for standardised indicators, harmonised datasets, and comprehensive metadata and licensing to support reuse across institutions (e.g., CEH, Defra, JNCC, government bodies).

- Data collection, management and interoperability
  - High-resolution explanatory data on land management and policy interventions are required to robustly attribute drivers of change.
  - Data availability and compatibility across the UK require strategic planning and mechanisms for cross-disciplinary data access.

- Analytical approaches and modelling
  - Spatial and multi-scale modelling demonstrates potential for predicting ecosystem-service delivery and testing policy scenarios (e.g., agri-environment interventions, landscape-scale outcomes).
  - Emphasis on integrating ecological indicators with socio-economic contexts to inform decision-making; recognition that some relationships are complex or non-intuitive.

- Policy context and implications
  - Policy frameworks considered include the EU Water Framework Directive and landscape-level ecosystem approaches aimed at water quality, biodiversity, and the provisioning of ecosystem services.
  - Pollination services are linked to nectar-diversity indicators, highlighting policy needs for landscape mosaics and habitat connectivity; potential alignment with LWEC insect-pollinators initiatives and CAP reforms.
  - Climate-change targets and soil-carbon management are central to rural policy; findings on soil carbon storage emphasize data gaps for short-term policy decision-making and the need for robust carbon accounting and scenario analyses.

- Landscape quality and cultural services
  - Chapter 6 demonstrates potential to measure landscape quality via ecological complexity and perceived landscape values; integration with qualitative social research can yield maps of charismatic landscapes and cultural service provisions.
  - Measuring cultural services presents methodological challenges, but CS demonstrates potential to contribute to evidence on landscape variables and public appreciation.

- Discussion and guidance for data leaders
  - Integrated assessments reveal important trade-offs and synergies among services (e.g., food production vs. soil carbon storage) and the benefits of model-based mapping across 1 km squares.
  - A unified, cross-disciplinary methodological framework is needed to compare ecosystem-service indicators consistently across science, policy, and sectoral contexts.
  - Collaboration with economics and social sciences is essential to develop comparable valuation methods and robust decision-support tools.

- Future work and recommendations for data strategy
  - Develop common data standards, harmonised indicators, and interoperable data platforms to enable cross-sector analyses and national-scale decision support.
  - Prioritise collection and integration of high-resolution land-management histories, positive-management data, and social indicators at the square level.
  - Expand habitat and soil-layer coverage to strengthen attribution and scenario analyses; improve data depth for rapid policy-relevant insights.
  - Invest in ensemble modelling and scenario-based projections to quantify uncertainties and support policy options aligned with NEA/LWEC objectives.
  - Position CS as a long-term backbone for ecosystem-service monitoring while aligning with evolving EU and UK policy contexts.

- Data leaders' overarching guidance
  - Data architecture: maintain an integrated, lineage-traceable dataset linking CS with climate, deposition, hydrology and land-use data; enforce robust metadata, licensing, and version control to support reuse.
  - Interoperability and standards: standardise indicators, units, and ontologies; harmonise cross-country datasets; document remaining gaps transparently.
  - Access and collaboration: enable cross-agency data sharing to improve attribution analyses and policy relevance; promote open access to modelling pipelines and online appendices while safeguarding sensitive data.
  - Data gaps and investments: prioritise high-resolution land-management data and social indicators; expand coverage for underrepresented habitats and deeper soil layers.
  - Analytics and governance: use ensemble modelling to quantify uncertainty; develop decision-support tools that translate outputs into actionable policy choices; align analyses with NEA/LWEC needs.
  - Knowledge exchange: strengthen communication between researchers and policymakers; translate complex analyses into clear, policy-relevant guidance across scales from farm to national levels.
  - Future-proofing: leverage CS as a monitoring backbone for ecosystem-service indicators; anticipate integration of new services and updated scenarios as data evolve.
