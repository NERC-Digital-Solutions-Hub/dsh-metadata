# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Windermere North Basin, UK, 2021 -2022

## Overview
- Fortnightly monitoring dataset from the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Contains surface temperature, surface oxygen, Secchi depth, water chemistry, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from 2021 to 2022.
- Raw data presented (not yet quality controlled or calibrated) but double entered and visually checked.

## Data collected
- Variables (with units):
  - TEMP: surface temperature in degrees Celsius
  - OXYG: surface oxygen saturation in % air-saturation
  - SECC: Secchi depth in metres
  - ALKA: alkalinity in µg CaCO3 per litre
  - pH: pH
  - NH4N: ammonium in µg N per litre
  - NO3N: nitrate in µg N per litre
  - PO4P: soluble reactive phosphate in µg P per litre
  - TOTP: total phosphorus in µg P per litre
  - SIO2: dissolved reactive silicon in µg per litre
  - TOCA: phytoplankton chlorophyll a in µg per litre
- Measurement period: January 2021 to end of 2022
- Water samples: integrated from 0 to 7 m; collected from a boat at a marked location (buoy) at the deepest part of Windermere

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling as part of ongoing monitoring.
- Sampling location: Windermere North Basin, deepest part of the lake; measurements taken from a boat at a buoy.
- Area: Windermere, Cumbria, England.

## Data structure
- Data provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns:
  - Date: date of measurement
  - Description: variable name (e.g., TEMP, OXYG, SECC, ALKA, pH, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA)
  - Value: measured value for each variable
  - Sign(if<LOD): indicator of below detection limit (a < sign if applicable)

## Quality control and limitations
- Data are raw and not yet quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data validation involved double entry and visual checks.
- Missing data explained by weather conditions, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Data provenance and support
- Data collection supported by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) awards NE/R016429/1 (UK-SCaPE) and NE/Y006208/1 (ACCESS-UK) as part of National Capability.
- Part of the North Basin Windermere monitoring program (Windermere, Cumbria).
