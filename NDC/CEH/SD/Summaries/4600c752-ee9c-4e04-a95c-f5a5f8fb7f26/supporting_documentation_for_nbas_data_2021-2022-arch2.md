# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Windermere North Basin, UK, 2021 -2022

## Overview
- Ongoing fortnightly monitoring dataset from the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Variables captured: surface temperature (TEMP, °C); surface oxygen saturation (OXYG, % air-saturation); Secchi depth (SECC, m); alkalinity (ALKA, µg CaCO3/L); pH; ammonium (NH4N, µg N/L); nitrate (NO3N, µg N/L); soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P, µg P/L); total phosphorus (TOTP, µg P/L); dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2, µg/L); phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA, µg/L).
- Phytoplankton chlorophyll a used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass.
- Sample type: integrated from 0 to 7 m; collected from a boat at the deepest lake location.
- Timeframe: January 2021 through the end of 2022.
- Data format: downloadable CSV with clearly defined variable descriptions and units.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling cadence.
- Measurements taken at the Windermere North Basin buoy location, at the lake’s deepest point.
- Data fields include value and a sign indicator for below-detection-limit values.

## Quality control and limitations
- Data provided are raw and have not yet undergone quality control or calibration.
- Data have been double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data attributed to weather conditions, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.
- Values below detection limits are flagged with a “<” sign in the Sign(if<LOD) column.

## Data structure and access
- Data stored as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns include:
  - Date: measurement date
  - Variable, Description: name and description of each measured parameter
  - Value, Description: numerical value for each variable
  - Sign(if<LOD), Description: indicator of below-detection-limit (a “<” sign)
- Variables and units clearly defined within the description fields.
