# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Windermere North Basin, UK, 2021 -2022

## Overview
- Ongoing fortnightly monitoring dataset from Windermere North Basin (Cumbria, England) covering January 2021 to December 2022.
- Variables include surface temperature (TEMP), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG), Secchi depth (SECC), alkalinity (ALKA), pH, ammonium (NH4N), nitrate (NO3N), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P), total phosphorus (TOTP), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA).
- Data provided in a comma-separated values (CSV) file with columns: Date, Variable Description, Value, Sign (if < LOD).

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling at the North Basin buoy location in the deepest part of Windermere.
- Water samples taken from 0 to 7 m depth; measurements made on a boat.
- Variables reported with specified units, collected between January 2021 and end of 2022.

## Data content and structure
- TEMP: degrees Celsius; OXYG: % air-saturation; SECC: metres; ALKA: µg CaCO3 per litre; pH: (unitless); NH4N: µg N per litre; NO3N: µg N per litre; PO4P: µg P per litre; TOTP: µg P per litre; SIO2: µg per litre; TOCA: µg per litre.
- Data organized with columns: Date, Description (variable), Value, Sign (indicates below detection limit if present).

## Data quality status
- Data are raw and have not yet undergone formal quality control or calibration.
- Double entered and visually checked; some missing data attributed to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staffing constraints.

## Metadata, accessibility, and governance
- Data are structured for download (CSV) with explicit variable descriptions and units.
- Detection-limit indicators included (Sign column) to flag values below detection.
- While not detailed in this document, the dataset supports transparency through clear data formatting and provenance notes.

## Provenance and funding
