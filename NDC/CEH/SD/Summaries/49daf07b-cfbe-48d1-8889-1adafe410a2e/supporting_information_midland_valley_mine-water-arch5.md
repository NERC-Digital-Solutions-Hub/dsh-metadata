# 1 Data Overview

- The study measures green-house gas (GHG) concentrations, physio-chemical water properties, metal concentrations, and carbon isotopes in mine water from legacy coal mines across the Midland Valley, Scotland.
- Data were collected June–September 2022 at sixteen mine water outflows (MA1–MA16), with additional sampling at four treatment locations within reed bed systems to assess treatment impacts.
- Some sites (MA7, MA10) used cascade treatments; others (MA11, MA12) used peroxide; sampling tracked points from source to treatment outlet (source, cascade, deep, reed, outflow).

## Study objectives

- Quantify origins, concentrations, fluxes, and sinks of GHGs and heavy metals from mine water across locations.
- Determine the origins of CH4 and CO2, and whether origins shift between different flooded mine environments.
- Assess how heavy metal concentrations vary and what drives these changes.
- Evaluate treatment effects (oxidation, settling ponds, reed beds) on water properties, metals, and GHGs.

## Site description and data collection

- Sixteen mine water outflows were selected across the Midland Valley, spanning from Lathallan Mill (MA1) to Kames (MA16), covering Fife, Central, Lothian, and Ayrshire coalfields.
- Some outflows discharged directly to rivers; others had treatment systems.
- Each site is described with exact coordinates, height above sea level, and mine water location name; treatment presence noted (Yes/No).
- Data collection included mapping of site locations (Table 1) and measurement points within treatment systems (Table 2). Measurement points at treatment sites include Source, Cascade end, Deep, Reed, and Outflow.
- Notable sampling notes: MA13 likely collects seepage; MA4/MA2 measurements may have experienced some outgassing due to piping; several sites closed between 1800–1989, with mining environments categorized mainly as Limestone Coal Group or Lower Limestone Coal Group (with MA2 and MA4 exceptions).

## Data collection details

- 4.1 Water properties and GHG concentrations
  - Direct sampling at the mine outflow was often not possible; water collected in a 10 L bucket as close to the outflow as possible to minimize degassing.
  - Headspace gas sampling conducted in triplicate per location using a headspace method with syringes and vials; ambient air samples collected for comparison.
  - In situ measurements of conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, DO%, and pH were taken near the surface (10 cm depth) using a multi-parameter meter.
  - A 2 L bottle of water was used for lab analysis, kept cool until processing.

- 4.2 Samples for Carbon stable and radiogenic isotopes
  - CH4 and CO2 isotopes required 2 mg C per gas; typically 10–70 L of water were processed to obtain sufficient CH4.
  - Water was collected in a 10 L accordion container, air removed, and CO2 stripped with soda lime to avoid atmospheric CO2 contamination.
  - Water was filled gently to minimize degassing; 1 L of degassed air was added to the container, shaken, and then gas was transferred to gas-tight bags for isotope analysis.
  - When direct pumping was not feasible, samples were drawn from buckets.

## Analytical methods

- Gas analyses (CO2, CH4, N2O): Headspace samples analyzed with an Agilent 7890B GC and 7697A headspace autosampler; calibration with mixed standards; typical runs within 1 week of collection.
- Water chemistry and organics: Filtration (Whatman GF/F, 0.7 µm) followed by analysis of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved carbon (TDC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using a Shimadzu TOC-L; filtered waters also analyzed by ion chromatography for major ions (Cl−, NO3−, SO4−, Na+, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+).
- Metals: ICP-MS (unfiltered and filtered samples) after acidification (1% HNO3) using a wide range of elements (from Li to U), with multiple calibrations at six dilutions.
- Isotopes: Radiogenic and stable carbon isotopes (Δ14C and δ13C) measured at NEIF Radiocarbon Laboratory in East Kilbride.
- Data handling and metadata: Tables 3–5 detail units and data fields for water properties/GHGs, ICP-MS metals, and carbon isotopes, respectively. Missing values are marked with asterisk.

## Gas partial pressures and data interpretation

- Dissolved gas concentrations derived from headspace equilibrations using mass-balance equations, incorporating barometric pressure, temperature, and gas solubility (βT).
- Results converted to ppmv via the Ideal Gas Law.
- Acknowledged uncertainties: potential outgassing and turbulence at measurement times may cause measured concentrations to be lower bounds; some samples showed bubble formation (e.g., at MA4), and sampling turbulence during collection (MA7, MA11). Overall, data are treated as minimum observed GHG concentrations.

## Nature and units of recorded values

- Data are organized in Tables 3–5 with clearly defined columns and units:
  - Table 3: Water physicochemical properties and GHG concentrations (Date, Latitude, Longitude, Cond, Temp, pH, DO, DO%, TDC, DIC, TDN, various ions, CH4/CO2/N2O concentrations and saturations, gas partial pressures at air, and CH4/CO2 gas saturations).
  - Table 4: ICP-MS metals (Location_Name, Location_Code, Filtration, Date, element concentrations, RSDs, etc.).
  - Table 5: Radiogenic and stable carbon isotopes (Gas measured, Sample_Code, Date, coordinates, grant/publication details, %Modern, radiocarbon ages, isotope values, etc.).
- Units include decimal degrees for coordinates; µS/cm for conductivity; °C for temperature; mg/L for DO, TDN, TDC, DIC; µmol/L for most ions, CH4, CO2, N2O, and their concentrations; ppm/ppb for isotope-related data; and various specific units for isotopic measurements.
