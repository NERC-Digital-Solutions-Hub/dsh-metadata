# Data Overview

- Context and scope
  - Measurements of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, physio-chemical water properties, metal concentrations, and carbon radiogenic and stable isotope data to investigate mine water from legacy coal mines across the Midland Valley, Scotland (June–September 2022).
  - Two study strands: (1) mine water sources (16 outflows) to characterize GHGs, metals, and water chemistry; (2) mine water treatment effectiveness at four sites through reed pools and other treatment configurations.

- Study objectives
  - Quantify origins of CH4 and CO2 produced in flooded, abandoned mine environments.
  - Assess whether CH4 and CO2 origins vary between environments and what drives changes.
  - Track changes in heavy metal concentrations across environments and drivers of these changes.
  - Evaluate treatment processes (oxidation, settling ponds, reed beds) on water properties, metals, and GHGs.

- Sites and sampling design
  - Sixteen mine water outflows (MA1–MA16) across the Midland Valley, from Lathallan Mill (MA1) to Kames (MA16), including sites in Fife, Central, Lothian, and Ayrshire coal fields.
  - Some sites feature treatment systems; others discharge directly to rivers/streams.
  - Four treatment locations sampled through treatment systems:
    - Cuthill (MA7): Cascade (MA7-S, MA7-C, MA7-D, MA7-R, MA7-O)
    - Kingshill (MA10): Cascade (MA10-S, MA10-C, MA10-D, MA10-R, MA10-O)
    - Mousewater (MA12, peroxide): Deep, Reed, Out (MA12-D, MA12-R, MA12-O)
    - Pool Farm (MA11, peroxide): Source, Deep, Reed, Out (MA11-S, MA11-D, MA11-R, MA11-O)
  - MA11 site had the second reed pool bypassed during the survey.
  - Detailed site information and photographs provided in accompanying materials.

- Data collection and methods
  - Water properties and GHG sampling
    - In some locations, water collected in a 10 L bucket near the outflow due to access constraints.
    - Headspace gas sampling performed in triplicate with ambient air samples; samples analyzed for CO2, CH4, and N2O.
    - Conductivity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, DO%, and other basic water properties measured in situ near the surface.
  - Isotope and gas analyses
    - Large volumes (2–70 L) processed to obtain 2 mg carbon per gas for CH4 and CO2 isotopic analyses; CO2 degassed using soda lime to minimize atmospheric CO2 contamination.
    - Gas drawn into headspace and transferred to gas-tight bags for isotope analyses.
  - Treatment-system sampling
    - For each treatment location, samples collected at multiple stages (source, end of cascade, exit from deep pool, reed bed, and outflow) to assess treatment effects on GHGs and metals.
  - Data handling
    - Datasets prepared with consistent sample codes, locations, and sampling dates; photographs and site information included in Appendix.

- Analytical workflow and instruments
  - GHG concentrations
    - Agilent 7890B GC with headspace autosampler; analysis for CO2, CH4, and N2O.
    - Use of mixed gas standards for quantification.
  - Water chemistry and metals
    - Filtration of water samples followed by: total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved carbon (TDC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) via TOC-L; calculation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC).
    - Ion chromatography for anions and cations, with a mixed standard solution for calibration.
    - ICP-MS (ACIDified samples) for a wide suite of metals (e.g., Li, Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Nb, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sb, Cs, Tl, Hg, Pb, U).
  - Isotopes
    - Radiogenic and stable carbon isotopes (δ13C and Δ14C) measured at NEIF Radiocarbon Laboratory.
  - Data handling and quality
    - Data prepared for storage in relevant data portals; standard methods applied for calibration and QA/QC.

- Calculations and caveats
  - Dissolved gas concentrations inferred from headspace data using a mass-balance approach with equilibration assumptions.
  - Concentrations converted to ppmv via the Ideal Gas Law; partial pressures calculated with calibrations and temperature corrections.
  - Acknowledged potential errors:
    - CO2 estimates may be affected by dynamic carbonate equilibria; estimated <5% error under study conditions.
    - Outgassing and turbulence (e.g., at source, during sampling) can cause underestimation; measurements likely represent minimum GHG concentrations.
  - Data presentation notes
    - Tables 3–5 define units and data structure; missing data flagged in CSV files.
    - Appendix includes sample site photographs.
