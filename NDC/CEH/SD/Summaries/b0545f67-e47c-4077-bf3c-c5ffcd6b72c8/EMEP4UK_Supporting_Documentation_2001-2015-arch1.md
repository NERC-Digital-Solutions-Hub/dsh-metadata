# Supporting documentation for European Monitoring and Evaluation Program Model for the UK (EMEP4UK) daily atmospheric composition and fluxes for UK-SCAPE (2001 - 2015)

- The dataset provides daily averaged atmospheric composition and fluxes for the UK (2001–2015) focusing on main nitrogen, sulfur, particulate organic matter, and ozone. It was produced with the EMEP4UK rv4.17 model and the WRF model version 3.7.1.
- Experimental design: An atmospheric chemistry transport model (ACTM) derived from EMEP MSC-W rv4.17, driven by 3D meteorology from WRF 3.7.1, with data assimilation of NWP reanalysis meteorology from NCEP/NCAR GFS at 1°×1° every 6 hours.
- Spatial domain and resolution: EU domain at 0.5°×0.5° with a nested UK domain at ~0.05°×0.055° (roughly 5×6 km2). Only UK-domain results are included here.
- Emissions inputs: UK 2015 National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI) emissions are rescaled to 2001–2015; non-UK emissions use EMEP CEIP 0.5°×0.5° data with the UK total used for year-specific scaling. Shipping emissions (FMI, 2011) are applied with rescaling to NMVOC and PM using NMVOC=0.029×NOx, PM2.5=0.95×PM, PMcoarse=0.05×PM because NMVOC and PM for shipping are not annually estimated.
- Data products: Daily averaged model outputs including concentrations and deposition fluxes for a wide range of species (e.g., PM2.5, PMcoarse, PM10, NOx, NO3, NH3, NH4, SO2, SO4, O3, NO2, etc.), and various dry and wet deposition terms, as well as meteorological and boundary-layer variables (e.g., mixing height, near-surface gas concentrations, rainfall, etc.).
- NetCDF structure and variables: Surface concentrations and deposition fluxes with detailed variable names (e.g., DDEP_HNO3_m2Conif, DDEP_NO2_m2Crops, WDEP_HNO3, SURF_MAXO3, SURF_ppb_NO2, SURF_ug_DUST, etc.). The units are provided in the NetCDF files; examples of deposition and concentration variables are explicitly mapped.
- Output scope: The daily averaged EMEP4UK data are provided for the UK-SCAPE project (2001–2015).
- Quality control and limitations: QA/QC were performed for 2001–2015; QA/QC reports are available on request but not included in this document. Use of the data is at the user’s own risk; no warranty or guarantee of error-free content.
- Data access and reuse: The documentation notes that datasets were prepared to be discoverable and usable via portals with metadata, and there is extensive methodological detail to support reproducibility and cross-dataset integration.
- Implementation details: The model and data processing were compiled and run using the Intel FORTRAN compiler (2013_sp1.3.174) on the CEH NEMSIS computing cluster.
