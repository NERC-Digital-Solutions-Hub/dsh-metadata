# LANDWISE Broad-scale Field Survey - Record Sheet

## Purpose and use
- Standardized field record sheet for broad-scale environmental monitoring.
- Enables demonstration of environmental condition and policy performance over time.
- Supports data verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation.
- Outputs can be reports, maps, and charts; datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.

## Data captured

- General information
  - Site name, field name, field/plot information (tick boxes/add info)
  - Date, field number, unrepresentative field areas, last ploughed
- Land use and management
  - Land use categories: Arable rotation with grass, Arable rotation without grass, Grassland (permanent, ≥5 years), Woodland (broadleaf, mature)
  - Grass-only rotations, grazing history (weeks per year, managed/unmanaged, stock density, stock out-wintered, mob/paddock grazing)
  - Tillage type (conventional, minimum, no-till), controlled traffic, tramline width/spacing
  - Tree species and age (where applicable)
  - Liming status and other soil amendments
  - Path management and drainage status
- LANDWISE Soil and Geology Class
  - Soil/Geology descriptors (examples): shallow over chalk/limestone; free-draining loamy over chalk/limestone; impeded drainage loamy/clayey; slowly permeable loamy/clayey; floodplain or high groundwater loamy/clayey over mudstone
  - Sometimes includes gravel superficial deposits over mudstone
- Drainage and water-related features
  - Field drainage, history of flooding, waterlogged conditions (≥1 week/year), water/sediment runoff
- Current management practices by land use
  - Arable: field drainage, crop types/rotation, cover crops, herbal leys, organic/conventional status, organic amendments
  - Grassland: buffer strips/zones, grazing practices, stocking details, crop rotations (if applicable)
  - Woodland: buffer strips, drainage, grazing/stocking (if applicable)
- Land use history and other considerations
  - History of land use, past flooding history, other comments

## Observational and sampling details

- Field/plot general observations
  - Surface form (flat, gentle, steep, undulating; furrowed/mounded/flattened)
  - Surface water, ponded water, brown water runoff
  - Surface condition (unslaked/slaked/capped), erosion features, deposition features
  - Slope-related observations (tramline wheelings/ruts, poached ground)
- Sampling location information
  - Location markers and notes for sampling sites (to be added as needed)

## Data quality, storage and access

- Data undergo verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation.
- Outputs include standardized assessments of environmental health against standards.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to relevant portals for accessibility and reuse.

## Key challenges and opportunities (for Analysts)

- Increasing the value of datasets by combining with other relevant data sources (avoiding single-use datasets).
- Enabling access to the underlying data used to produce outputs.
