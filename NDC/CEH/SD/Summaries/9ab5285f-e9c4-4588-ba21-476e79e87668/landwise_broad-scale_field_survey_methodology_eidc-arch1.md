# Aim Quantify the impact of different land use and management strategies on key soil properties that affect infiltration and water storage across the main soils type in the West Thames catchment.

## Objective
- Define a sampling strategy and associated field and laboratory methods to determine near-surface soil properties and vegetation characteristics in predominantly agricultural fields subjected to various land-based Natural Flood Management (NFM) measures.
- Target properties: soil texture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil volumetric water content (VWC), soil dry bulk density (BD), vegetation type/height/cover, soil aggregate stability (slaking & dispersion test), and soil structure (Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure; VESS).

## Study design: sampling strategy (land use and management)
- Fixed effects (controls you actively set):
  - Land use: Arable, Grassland (permanent, >5 years), Woodland (broadleaf, mature)
  - Management (within arable): Arable rotation with grass vs. Arable rotation without grass
- Covariates / random effects (uncontrolled but influential):
  - Management practices, Crop types, Rotation, Tillage (Organic, Conventional, Min Till, No Till), Cover crops, Controlled Traffic, Field Drainage, Flooding history, and other unknown factors
- Objective of design:
  - Achieve balanced sampling across combinations of land use, management, and soil types while acknowledging practical field constraints.

## Soil type framework
- Five broad soil types on carbonate and mudstone geology (as used in LANDWISE mapping):
  - Shallow chalk or limestone (carbonate)
  - Free draining loamy (carbonate)
  - Impeded drainage loamy/clayey (carbonate)
  - Slowly permeable loamy/clayey (mudstone)
  - Floodplain or high groundwater loamy/clayey (mudstone)
- Subcategories reflect siting (e.g., sandy/loamy on sandstone; naturally wet soils on mudstone) and correspond to LANDWISE Soil.Type classifications.
- Sampling targets across these soil types aim to cover representative field conditions while avoiding designated areas.

## Field sampling plan: field locations and replication
- Field-level replication goal:
  - Ideally 20 soil-type × land-use/management combinations, with about 8 replicates per combination (total ~160 fields), constrained by total sample capacity (up to ~2000 samples).
  - In practice, may focus on a subset of soil types based on available fields; avoid pseudo-replication by limiting to one field per table cell per farm.
- In-field sampling scheme (grassland and arable examples):
  - 15 sampling locations per field:
    - 5 infield
    - 5 trafficked edges (tramlines/headlands)
    - 5 untrafficked margins (uncultivated rough edges, >1 m from stems/burrows)
  - 3 VESS assessments per field (one location from infield, trafficked, and untrafficked)
- Trafficking strategy:
  - Trafficked locations chosen to capture the most apparent tramlines/paths while ensuring spatial variation across the field.
- Woodland scheme:
  - Specific WD (Woodland) sampling framework with mineral and organic layers; VESS applied at select locations within grid cells.

## Sampling procedure: fixed-volume and additional samples
- Depth and material:
  - Near-surface 0–51 mm (or 0–50 mm) bgl mineral soil samples using a 50 mm diameter ring (BD/VWC measurement).
  - If an organic surface layer >50 mm deep, collect both organic (0–50 mm) and mineral (0–50 mm) samples; otherwise only mineral sample.
- Fixed-volume samples per plot:
  - 6 or 12 fixed-volume samples per field (depending on organic layer depth and grid strategy).
  - 6 or 12 additional small samples per grid cell (0–50 mm bgl) for SOM, slaking, texture, bulked by grid cell.
- VESS:
  - Up to 1–2 VESS assessments per grid cell per field (specific locations in UN/TR/IN scheme depend on land use).
- Grid cell sampling (minimum 0.25 ha plots):
  - 6 locations per grid cell for mineral soil, with additional organic layer sampling if present.
  - Grid-cell samples bulked for lab analysis to match field sampling strategy.

## Pre-survey actions
- Engage landowner/manager; obtain consent and a general farm map.
- Compile potential sampling field lists using:
  - OS 1:10k or 1:25k maps, soil maps (e.g., SoilScapes), Defra MAGIC map (designated areas).
- Exclude fields with multiple soil types or designated restrictions; confirm land management and NFM measures.
- Prepare and label sampling kits, sample bags, field cards, and consent forms.
- Arrange logistics (sampling date/time, access routes, emergency contacts).

## On-site actions: preparation and sampling
- Consent and safety:
  - Complete consent forms; assess risk and agree access routes.
- Documentation:
  - Take photos and record field identifiers, GPS coordinates (BNG/OSGB), vegetation cover, and field observations.
  - Complete Landwise field survey record sheets.
- Sampling:
  - Prepare surface by clearing debris; insert 50 mm ring vertically to 0 mm depth for V samples.
  - Trim soil flush with ring, collect, label (V bag) with date/time, and seal.
  - Collect an additional 0–50 mm sample adjacent to each V location (A bag) for supplementary analyses; document texture via field hand-texturing method.
  - If using VESS, follow VESS protocol and record results.
- Field grouping:
  - Group field samples by field and label sets (farms, fields, and sample codes).
- Equipment hygiene and safety:
  - Clean tools between sites; ensure PPE is worn; carry emergency contact details.

## Post-survey actions
- Data handling:
  - Type field sheets into electronic formats; scan and organize PDFs with consistent filenames.
  - Store photos and records in date-stamped folders per field.
- Sample handling:
  - Temporarily store samples in a cool, dry place; deliver to CEH/UoR storage in batches for lab processing.
  - Return consent forms and digital records to CEH for linkage with samples.
- Data integrity:
  - Maintain traceability of samples and metadata; minimize cross-contamination.

## Laboratory analysis and texture assessment
- Primary analyses (as needed):
  - Particle size distribution (texture) and organic matter content (for soil characterisation).
- Optional hand-texturing:
  - Field-based texture identification using standardized descriptions for sands, loams, silty/clays, and clays.
- Texture classification and grouping:
  - Use texture triangles and associated groupings (e.g., sandy, light silty, medium, heavy) to inform management implications.

## Data management and practical considerations
- Data outputs:
  - Quantitative measurements: BD, VWC, SOM, texture fractions; qualitative assessments: vegetation type/cover/height, VESS scores.
  - Location-level metadata: field IDs, soil type, land use, management, dates, and sampling depth.
- Data challenges relevant to analysts:
  - Data access and standardization across many soil types and land uses.
  - Ensuring consistent sampling across fields to avoid pseudo-replication.
  - Managing large, multi-source datasets (field notes, lab results, geospatial data).
  - Tracking provenance and ensuring datasets are discoverable and usable (metadata, portals, etc.).

## Key outputs and implications for analysis
- A structured dataset linking soil properties (texture, SOM, BD, VWC, aggregation, structure) with land use, management practices, and soil types across West Thames catchment fields.
- Rich contextual metadata on vegetation, sampling locations, and NFM measures to support correlation analyses and predictive modeling of infiltration and water storage.
- Documentation of the sampling framework to enable reproducibility and future longitudinal studies.

## Challenges and considerations for Analysts
- Access to appropriate, scaled data at the right local level may be limited; this plan anticipates structured, field-based data collection to fill gaps.
- Integration of multi-source data (field measurements, lab results, GIS maps) requires careful metadata and standardization.
- Balancing breadth (20 combinations, many fields) with depth (lab analyses) given logistical constraints and sample capacity.
- Ensuring findings are actionable for government or large environmental bodies by providing clear, navigable datasets and documented methods.
