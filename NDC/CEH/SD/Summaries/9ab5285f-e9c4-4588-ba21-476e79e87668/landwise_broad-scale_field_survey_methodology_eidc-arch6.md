# Quantify the impact of different land use and management strategies on key soil properties that affect infiltration and water storage across the main soils type in the West Thames catchment.

## Purpose andScope
- Define sampling strategy and associated field and laboratory methods to determine selected near-surface soil properties and vegetation characteristics of predominantly agricultural fields under various land-based Natural Flood Management (NFM) measures.
- Target properties/characteristics: soil texture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil volumetric water content (VWC), soil dry bulk density (BD), vegetation type/height/cover, soil aggregate stability (slaking & dispersion test) and soil structure (Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure; VESS).

## Sampling Strategy: Land Use and Management
- Fixed effects to control:
  - Land use: Arable, Grassland (permanent, established >5 years), Woodland (broadleaf, mature)
  - Management (for Arable): Arable rotation with grass vs Arable rotation without grass
- Covariates/random effects (things to account for but not controlled): Management practices, Crop types, Rotation, Organic vs Conventional Tillage, Min Till, No Till, Cover Crops, Controlled Traffic, Field Drainage, Flooding History, and other unknown factors.

## Sampling Strategy: Soil Type
- Five broad soil types on carbonate and mudstone geology (as used in LANDWISE surveys):
  - Shallow chalk or limestone (carbonate)
  - Free draining loamy (carbonate)
  - Impeded drainage loamy/clayey (carbonate)
  - Free draining sandy/loamy ( sandstone)
  - Naturally wet sandy/loamy (sandstone)
  - Slowly permeable loamy/clayey (mudstone)
  - Floodplain or high groundwater loamy/clayey (mudstone)
- Aim to sample across combinations of Land Use x Soil Type (20 combinations: 4 land-use classes x 5 soil types), with the goal of balanced replication (e.g., 8 replicates per cell; ~160 fields total). Practical constraints may adjust the focus to a subset of combinations.
- Replication guidance: generally one field/plot per table cell per farm to avoid pseudo-replication; more fields per site allowed if land-use management differs within the same soil/field category.

## Sampling Plan: Field Locations and Replicates
- Grassland sampling plan:
  - 15 sample locations per field:
    - 5 infield
    - 5 trafficked (cropped headland/tramlines)
    - 5 untrafficked margin (uncultivated/uncropped; avoid within 1 m of stems/burrows)
  - 3 VESS samples (one from each of infield, trafficked, untrafficked)
- Woodland sampling plan:
  - Distinctions for WD-M (mineral) and WD-O (organic) as applicable; 6 mineral and 6 organic samples per grid cell; VESS as required
- Arable sampling plan (implied by VESS distribution and grids):
  - 10 or 12 sample locations per plot (min 0.25 ha) across surface mineral and/or organic layers
  - 6 fixed-volume samples (0–51 mm bgl) plus 6 or 12 additional small samples per grid cell (bulk by grid cell)
  - 1 VESS per selected sampling location within the grid
  - Specific VESS sampling locations designated as Trafficked and Untrafficked, with Trafficked locations ensuring cross-field variation

## Fixed-Volume and Additional Samples per Field/Plot
- Per WD (woodland) grids:
  - 6 mineral samples (VESS location cover)
  - 6 organic samples if present (>50 mm organic layer)
- Per grid cell:
  - 6 or 12 additional small samples (0–50 mm bgl) for SOM, slaking, texture, etc., bulked by grid cell
  - This yields 6 or 12 additional samples per plot beyond fixed-volume samples

## Pre-Survey Actions
- Engage landowner/manager:
  - Provide participant information and consent, discuss methods, and obtain farm maps
  - Confirm land management and any NFM measures; check not recently ploughed
- Produce and obtain maps:
  - OS 1:10k or 1:25k field boundaries
  - Soil map (local map or NSRI SoilScapes)
  - Defra MAGIC map to identify designated areas
- Exclude unsuitable fields based on soil type variation and designated areas
- Schedule survey date/time and provide contact details
- Label and prepare two complete sets of sample bags (V for fixed-volume, A for additional)

## On-Site Action: Preparation and Sampling Protocol
- Meet landowner/manager, obtain consent, complete field questionnaire, and demonstrate sampling if needed
- Assess risks and establish access routes
- Take photographs and collect location data:
  - Landwise field ID, GPS coordinates (BNG), vegetation cover/height
- Sampling steps:
  - Insert 50 mm soil ring to 0 mm (surface) and extract 0–50 mm bgl mineral soil; trim to ring, bag as fixed-volume V samples with date/time
  - Collect an additional 0–50 mm bgl sample (A) adjacent to each V location; bag with date/time; perform hand texture assessment in field for a quick qualitative check
  - If VESS location is designated, perform VESS assessment as per the method sheet and record results
  - Group samples by field (e.g., in pedal bins), label with farm/field codes, and ensure clean equipment between sites
- Field notes:
  - Record precise GPS/BNG data, field observations, and vegetation details

## Post-Survey Actions
- Digitise field survey records and store electronic versions
- Scan and archive original field sheets, photos, and associated documents
- Transport samples to CEH for storage and analysis (refrigerated storage before shipment)
- Notify landowner/manager of completion if requested
- Share data and outputs with CEH/UoR; ensure traceability of sample IDs and dates

## Data Handling and Outputs
- Data collected include: soil texture (via PSD or hand texture), SOM, VWC, BD, vegetation metrics, VESS scores, and related field observations
- Laboratory analyses:
  - Particle Size Distribution (PSD)
  - Organic matter content
  - Possible slaking tests and texture classification
- Texture classification:
  - Hand texture assessment supported by flow charts to categorize soils into texture groups
  - Where PSD is used, plot results on texture triangles and assign texture groupings relevant to agricultural practices
- Volume and sampling design aim to produce a dataset suitable for data products and self-serve analysis, enabling insights across land use, soil type, and management practices

## Tools, Equipment, and Documentation
- Required field tools (rings, hammers, knives, trowels, bags, markers)
- Field cards, laminated method summaries, consent forms, and data sheets
- Maps (OS, SoilScapes, MAGIC), cameras, GPS devices
- PPE and safety gear, first aid, and planning documents

## Notes on Texture and Calcareous Content
- Practical hand-texture guidance to classify texture (sands, loams, clays) using grain size feel and stickiness
- Texture groups simplify agricultural management decisions
- Basic estimation of calcium carbonate content through qualitative indicators and responses to acid impact
