# LANDWISE Broad-scale Survey Lab Soil Analysis TEMPLATE

- A comprehensive, protocol-driven laboratory workflow for analyzing soil samples, detailing equipment, lab spaces, labeling schemes, data recording, measurements, calculations, and data storage.

## Purpose and scope
- Standardizes laboratory procedures to determine volumetric soil moisture, soil bulk density, soil organic matter (loss on ignition), calcareous content (HCl test), soil structure (slaking and dispersion), particle size distribution (hand texture and laser diffraction), and soil colour.
- Aims to ensure data quality, traceability, and reproducibility across the Landwise Broad-scale Survey program.

## Data collection and labeling
- Field-to-lab labeling discipline:
  - Volumetric moisture data linked to V-labelled lab trays; Organic matter linked to A-labelled trays.
  - Critical correspondence between field sample bags and lab tray labels recorded on the Landwise Lab Soil Analysis spreadsheet printout.
- Sample handling and timing:
  - Weigh samples in sealed bags, track in spreadsheets, and record start/end times for oven drying and analyses.
  - Immediate weighing after oven removal to prevent moisture uptake.
- Documentation and traceability:
  - Each step logged, with site name, field number, sample IDs, tray/crucible numbers, and corresponding field labels.
  - Finished data tied to site-specific workbook names (e.g., UoR Sonning Field 1…) stored under NEC06345_LANDWISE\Broad-scale Survey Site Data.

## Equipment, labs and data handling
- Labs and equipment categories:
  - Ovens Balance Room: volumetric moisture, bulk density, and SOM analyses.
  - Soil Hydrology Lab: slaking/dispersion, hand texture assessment.
  - Chemistry Lab Acid Fume Cupboard: HCl tests for calcareous soils.
  - MS2000 (Malvern Mastersizer) for particle size analysis (laser diffraction).
- Data handling practices:
  - Use of precision balances (0.1 g and 0.001 g) with calibration checks.
  - Spreadsheets as the central data capture and audit trail; printouts scanned and saved in site data folders.

## Measurements and calculations (key outputs)
- Volumetric soil moisture and bulk density (oven-drying method):
  - Volumetric moisture content and bulk density calculations using measured wet/dry masses, tray masses, and a known sample volume.
  - Gravimetric moisture and volumetric conversion formulas included.
- Soil organic matter (loss on ignition, LOI):
  - SOM (%) = ((SOIL105 - SOIL400) / SOIL105) × 100.
  - Post-analysis crucible weights used to compute LOI.
- Calcareous soil content:
  - HCl test following Natural England method; results categorized by visible effervescence (None to Strong).
- Slaking and dispersion:
  - Visual scoring (0-4) at 10 minutes and 2 hours, to assess aggregate breakdown and dispersion.
- Hand texture and texture by laser diffraction:
  - Qualitative texture assess via hand method; quantitative dispersion using MS2000 with standard prep and 3 replicates per batch.
- Colour analysis:
  - Retained air-dried sample set sent to University of Reading (UoR) for colour analysis.
- Data integrity and traceability:
  - Results flow from bench to the Landwise Lab Soil Analysis spreadsheet; batch-level data exported to Excel and stored in project folders.

## Data quality, standards, and governance
- Data accuracy and repeatability:
  - Regular balance checks (0.1 g; 0.001 g for SOM) and oven/furnace temperature control.
  - Pre- and post-analysis weighing with careful handling to avoid contamination.
  - Replicate measurements in MS2000 for HydroG analyses; consistency checked in software (results analysis tab).
- Metadata and standards:
  - Clear protocols for sample labeling, lab-to-field traceability, and file naming conventions (site name, field no., etc.).
  - Reference methods cited for LOI, HCl test, slaking/dispersion, and texture analyses.

## Data storage, archiving and accessibility
- File naming and storage:
  - Landwise Broad-scale Survey Lab Soil Analysis data stored as site-specific Excel workbooks (e.g., UoR Sonning Field 1… .xlsx).
  - All printouts scanned and saved to the corresponding site sub-folder in NEC06345_LANDWISE\Broad-scale Survey Site Data.
- Data export and transfer:
  - MS2000 data exported to Excel, saved to memory sticks, and then copied into the project folder.
  - Centralizes data provenance from field bag to final dataset.

## Operational notes and safety
- Safety and handling:
  - Oven/furnace use requires careful handling of hot crucibles and trays; silica gel desiccants may be reactivated by heating.
  - HCl handling performed in acid fume cupboard; spillage management and proper disposal procedures noted.
- Procedure fidelity:
  - Trays and crucibles are not reused beyond defined mass tolerances and contamination checks.
  - Batch management includes testing initial samples to calibrate obscuration for MS2000 measurements.

## End-to-end workflow snapshot
- Field collection → labeling and bagging → transport to walk-in fridge → lab labeling and tracking in Landwise spreadsheet → volumetric moisture, bulk density (oven-drying) → SOM (LOI) → calcareous soil (HCl) → slaking/dispersion → hand texture → laser diffraction (MS2000) → soil colour sampling → data export to site workbook → scan/archiving of printouts.

## Key takeaways for data leadership
- The template enforces rigorous data traceability from field labels to lab results, with explicit data capture in a centralized spreadsheet and standardized file naming/archiving.
- It integrates multiple analyses into a cohesive data workflow, supporting transparent audit trails, reproducibility, and cross-user collaboration across partner networks.
- Quality control, metadata management, and clear data ownership are embedded through labeling conventions, replication protocols, and documented data storage practices.
