# Aim Quantify the impact of different land use and management strategies on key soil properties that affect infiltration and water storage across the main soils type in the West Thames catchment.

## Objective and data scope
- Define a comprehensive field sampling strategy and associated field/laboratory methods to determine near-surface soil properties and vegetation characteristics in predominantly agricultural fields under various land-based Natural Flood Management (NFM) measures.
- Target properties/characteristics include: soil texture, soil organic matter (SOM), volumetric water content (VWC), dry bulk density (BD), vegetation type/height/cover, soil aggregate stability (slaking & dispersion test), and Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS).

## Data strategy: what is being measured and why
- Capture a broad set of soil and vegetation metrics that influence infiltration and water storage.
- Ensure measurements are compatible for comparison across land uses and management regimes to support learning and decision-making in NFM implementation.

## Sampling design and data structure
- Fixed effects ( controllable by design ):
  - Land use: Arable, Grassland (permanent, established >5 years), Woodland (broadleaf, mature)
  - Management within land use: Arable rotation with grass, Arable rotation without grass
- Covariates / random effects (non-controllable but influential):
  - Management practices, Crop types, Rotation, Organic vs Conventional Tillage, Minimum Till, No Till, Cover Crops, Controlled Traffic, Field Drainage, Flooding History, plus other unknown factors
- Soil type categories (for survey coverage):
  - Five broad soils types on carbonate and mudstone geology, including: shallow chalk/limestone (carbonate), free draining loamy (carbonate), impeded drainage loamy/clayey (carbonate), free draining sandy/loamy (sandstone), naturally wet and slowly permeable variants (mudstone; includes floodplain/high groundwater types)
- Sampling intent:
  - Aim for roughly 20 combinations (4 land-use/management classes × 5 soil types)
  - Target around 160 fields (20 combinations × ~8 replicates) and up to 2000 individual samples, with attention to avoiding pseudo-replication (one field per cell from the same farm; multiple fields on the same soil/land-use cell allowed if management is distinct)

## Field and soil typology
- Soil typing framework drawn from LANDWISE/SoilScapes (illustrative combinations provided for planning)
- Field selection guided by available soil maps, field boundaries, and exclusion of designated areas (e.g., protected zones)

## Sampling plan by land use
- Grassland:
  - 15 sample locations per field
  - 5 infield, 5 trafficked (e.g., tramlines or headlands), 5 untrafficked margin
  - 3 VESS assessments (one at each of infield, trafficked, untrafficked)
  - 1 VESS location per zone; 1 fixed-volume V samples per WD location; 6–12 additional samples per grid cell as needed
- Woodland:
  - 6 mineral samples (with 1 VESS) and 6 organic samples if organic layer >50 mm; additional small samples collected per grid cell as needed
  - VESS sampling incorporated within grid cells
- Arable:
  - 6 or 12 sample locations per plot (min 0.25 ha)
  - 1 VESS per plot
  - Distinct sampling locations for fixed-volume BD/VWC and additional samples (0–50 mm depth for mineral and/or organic layers depending on surface organic depth)

## On-field sampling protocol (core components)
- Each field/plot:
  - Collect near-surface samples from 0–51 mm depth (V samples) using a 50 mm ring to a precise volume
  - If surface organic layer >50 mm, collect an organic-layer sample (0–50 mm) and then a mineral-layer sample (0–50 mm)
  - Collect additional small samples (0–50 mm) from grid cell locations for SOM, texture, slaking, etc., bulked per grid cell
  - Record precise location data (GPS/BNG), vegetation cover/height, and field observations
  - Take photos before/after sampling and maintain structured field IDs (Field 1, Field 2, etc.)
  - Group and label samples by field/plot and sampling type (V or A)
  - Follow careful techniques to avoid over-compaction and maintain consistent sample volumes
- VESS assessment:
  - Conduct VESS at designated sampling locations (one per defined zone or per grid cell as appropriate to land use)

## Pre-survey and on-site data governance
- Pre-survey actions:
  - Engage landowners/managers; obtain consent; gather farm maps and potential field/plot candidates
  - Compile GIS maps (OS boundaries, soil maps, Defra MAGIC map) and exclude designated areas
  - Decide survey dates, sample labeling schemes, and ensure field management details are up-to-date
- On-site actions:
  - Obtain consent, complete land management questionnaire, demonstrate sampling if needed
  - Assess risks and establish access routes
  - Record detailed observations and capture GPS coordinates, vegetation metrics, and field conditions
- Sample handling and labeling:
  - Use two complete sets of bags (V for fixed-volume samples; A for additional samples)
  - Label with farm, field, and sample codes; group samples by field
  - Prepare equipment, store samples, and ensure cross-site cleanliness to prevent contamination

## Post-survey data management
- Digitize and store records:
  - Transcribe field record sheets to electronic formats
  - Scan and organize originals by field and date
  - Store photos and metadata in date-stamped folders
- Sample handling after fieldwork:
  - Transport to CEH/UoR storage facilities, with fridge storage as needed
  - Maintain a clear handover process and appropriate documentation (consent forms, field sheets, photos)
- Quality controls:
  - Verify sampling volumes, sample labeling, and data entry accuracy
  - Ensure alignment of field IDs with laboratory submissions

## Data quality, limitations and considerations for data leaders
- Data consistency and comparability:
  - Standardized sampling depths, ring volumes, and VESS procedures to enable cross-field comparisons
  - Use of consistent GPS references and field IDs to support traceability
- Uncertainty and variability:
  - Acknowledge heterogeneity across fields, soils, and management practices; plan replicates accordingly
  - Avoid pseudo-replication by limiting multiple samples from the same farm for the same soil/land-use cell
- Data accessibility and discoverability:
  - Metadata-rich dataset with field boundaries, soil types, land-use categories, management practices, and sampling locations
  - Integration-ready with existing soil and land-use datasets (e.g., SoilScapes, MAGIC, OS maps)
- Collaboration and system-wide perspective:
  - Aligns with a broader data system view by documenting field protocols, sampling decisions, and data lineage
  - Facilitates sharing with partners and across networks while maintaining data quality and consistency

## How this supports data leaders’ aims
- Provides a structured, transparent, and repeatable data collection framework for soil and vegetation metrics related to infiltration and water storage
- Delivers a clear mapping of data assets to land use, management practices, and soil types, enabling gap analysis and prioritization
- Supports governance and collaboration through standardized field procedures, metadata, and data handling workflows
- Enhances the potential for co-ownership of data products by documenting user-relevant details (fields, locations, samples, and outcomes) and facilitating feedback loops for product iteration and dissemination
