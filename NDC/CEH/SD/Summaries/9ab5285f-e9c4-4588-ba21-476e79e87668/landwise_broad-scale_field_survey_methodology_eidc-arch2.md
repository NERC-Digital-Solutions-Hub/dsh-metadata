# Aim Quantify the impact of different land use and management strategies on key soil properties that affect infiltration and water storage across the main soils type in the West Thames catchment.

- Objective
  - Quantify how land use and management influence near-surface soil properties that control infiltration and water storage.
  - Focus on predominantly agricultural fields under various land-based Natural Flood Management (NFM) measures.

- Selected soil and vegetation properties
  - Soil texture
  - Soil organic matter (SOM)
  - Volumetric water content (VWC)
  - Dry bulk density (BD)
  - Vegetation type, height and cover
  - Soil aggregate stability (slaking & dispersion test)
  - Soil structure (Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure; VESS)

## Sampling design: land use, management and covariates

- Fixed effects (control factors)
  - Land use: Arable, Grassland (permanent, >5 years), Woodland (broadleaf, mature)
  - Arable management subclass: Rotation with grass vs rotation without grass
- Covariates / random effects (uncontrolled factors likely to affect outcomes)
  - Management practices, crop types, rotations
  - Organic vs conventional tillage, min till, no till
  - Cover crops, controlled traffic, field drainage
  - Flooding history and other unknown factors

## Sampling design: soil type stratification

- Five broad soil types on carbonate and mudstone geology (as used in LANDWISE survey)
  - Shallow chalk/limestone (carbonate)
  - Free draining loamy (carbonate)
  - Impeded drainage loamy/clayey (carbonate)
  - Free draining sandy/loamy (sandstone)
  - Naturally wet or slowly permeable loamy/clayey (mudstone)
  - Floodplain or high groundwater loamy/clayey (mudstone)
- Practical sampling goal
  - Ideally 20 combinations (4 land use/management classes × 5 soil types)
  - Target ~8 replicates per combination (total ~160 fields)
  - Realistically, adjust by site availability; generally avoid pseudo-replicates from the same farm field
  - Update note: approach refined 21/02/19 to allow field-level variation

## Sampling design: field replication and field layout

- Field/plot replication
  - Generally one field per table cell per farm; may sample more fields with distinct management within same soil/land-use cell
- Field counts and sample capacity
  - Aim to sample up to 2000 samples in total, balancing field replicates and within-field sampling intensity
- Representative field deployment
  - Adaptable to field availability; focus on capturing variation across soil type, land use, and management

## Field sampling plan: locations, VESS and replication

- Field-level target
  - Grassland: 15 sampling locations per field
    - 5 infield, 5 trafficked, 5 untrafficked margin
    - 3 VESS locations (one in each category: infield, trafficked, untrafficked)
  - General approach: 10 primary soil samples per field (5 trafficked, 5 untrafficked) plus 2 VESS per field
  - Untrafficked (UN) and Trafficked (TR) locations should be representative and varied across field
- Woodland sampling
  - Specific WD sampling structure (MINERAL: WD-M; optional organic samples if >50 mm)
  - 6 mineral, plus 6 organic (if required) per defined grid cell
- Per-plot sampling density (min size ~0.25 ha)
  - 6–12 sampling locations for BD/VWC (surface mineral and surface organic layers)
  - 1 VESS at designated location per field/grid cell

- VESS and soil layers
  - At each VD (WD) sampling location, perform VESS assessment
  - For mineral and organic layers, collect samples from fixed volumes and/or additional small samples for SOM, texture, and slaking

## Field sampling procedures: stepwise actions

- Pre-survey actions
  - Engage landowner/manager; obtain consent; collect farm maps
  - Identify potential fields using OS maps, soil maps, and Defra MAGIC map
  - Exclude fields with recent ploughing or designated areas; schedule survey
- On-site actions (pre-sampling)
  - Obtain consent and complete land management questionnaire
  - Check risks and plan access routes
- On-site sampling procedure
  - Photograph field IDs and general field context; record GPS/BNG coordinates
  - Plan and walk to approx. sampling locations; select representative points
  - For each sample location: take 0-51 mm fixed-volume soil sample (V) using a 50 mm ring; trim to ring; label and bag
  - Take an additional 0-50 mm sample (A) near the same location; label and bag; perform field hand texture assessment
  - If VESS is designated at a location, perform VESS assessment per sheet; photograph before/after
  - Group field samples for transport; clean equipment between sites
- Post-sampling actions
  - Digitize and store field sheets; scan and file originals
  - Save photos and records in date-labeled folders
  - Return soil samples to CEH for storage (fridge); coordinate drop-off
  - Share consent forms and electronic records with CEH
- Travel and logistics
  - Maintain site directions, landowner contacts, and necessary PPE and safety gear

## Sampling details: soil volumes and sampling logic

- Near-surface sampling (0–51 mm)
  - Use a 50 mm ID ring to collect mineral or organic layer depending on surface organic depth
  - If organic layer < 50 mm: sample mineral layer only (0–50 mm)
  - If organic layer > 50 mm: sample organic layer (0–50 mm, WD-O) and mineral layer (0–50 mm, WD-M) after clearing deeper organic material
- Additional samples
  - Collect extra small samples (0–50 mm) from grid cells for SOM, slaking, texture as required
  - Bulk small samples by grid cell to achieve 6 or 12 additional samples per plot
- VESS sampling
  - If required, follow VESS protocol with photos before/after block break-up
- Sample handling
  - Group into field-labeled sets; keep equipment clean; transport to CEH in labeled boxes

## Laboratory considerations and texture assessment

- Primary laboratory analyses (recommended)
  - Particle Size Distribution (PSD)
  - Organic matter content
- Texture and texture grouping
  - Field texture assessment by hand using a standardized flowchart
  - Texture groups for agricultural operations: sandy/light silty, medium, heavy
- Notes on soil texture interpretation
  - Hand texturing guidelines describe how to distinguish sands, loams, silt loams, clays, and mixtures
  - Consider calcareous content (calcium carbonate) and mineralogy when interpreting texture

## Documentation, equipment, and safety

- Documentation
  - Landwise field survey records, consent forms, field sheets, and digital records
  - Photos captured at each location and preserved with metadata
- Equipment and safety
  - Personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety gear; field maps; GPS; labelling materials
  - Soil rings, hammers, trowels, spades, sample bags, and storage containers
- Safety and wellbeing
  - PPE: safety boots, gloves, coat, over-trousers, hat, hi-visibility, safety glasses, sun protection, repellents
  - Hydration, snacks, first aid kit, and planning for emergency routes

## Data management and aims for analysts

- Data quality and standardization
  - Follow standardized sampling methods to enable cross-field and temporal comparisons
  - Ensure consistent field IDs, coordinates (BNG or lat/long), and field observations
- Data storage and sharing
  - Store datasets and outputs in centralized portals; ensure accessibility for policy assessment and monitoring
- Value and reuse

- Focus on robust, comparable datasets to enable scrutiny of environmental health and NFM performance over time
