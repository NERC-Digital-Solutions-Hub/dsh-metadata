# LANDWISE Broad-scale Field Survey - Record Sheet

## Purpose and scope
- A comprehensive field data collection tool to document site- and field-level conditions for broad-scale environmental health monitoring.
- Captures land use, soil/geology, management practices, drainage, water-related issues, and field surface observations to enable evaluation of policy effects and inform future decisions.

## Site, field, and temporal metadata
- Site name and Field name
- Field/plot information and general observations
- Date (DD/MM/YY) and Field no.
- Last ploughed and any unrepresentative field areas
- Field drainage status and water-related history (e.g., flooding history, waterlogged >1 week/year)

## Land use and soil/geology classification
- Land use options (examples):
  - Arable rotation with grass vs. Arable rotation without grass
  - Grassland (permanent, ~5+ years)
  - Woodland (broadleaf, mature)
- LANDWISE Soil and Geology Class indicators (e.g., shallow over chalk/limestone; free-draining loamy over chalk/limestone; impeded drainage loamy/clayey over chalk/limestone; floodplain or high groundwater loamy/clayey over mudstone)
- Other soil/geology notes and context (e.g., gravel superficial deposits over mudstone)

## Drainage, soil condition, and hydrology indicators
- Field drainage status
- Water-related observations (water/sediment runoff)
- Flooding history and waterlogged durations

## Management and farming practices (Current by land use)
- Grazing history:
  - Last grazed? within past 5 years?
  - Weeks grazing per year
  - Stocking density (head/ha)
  - Stock out-wintered? Mob/paddock grazing?
  - Managed vs. unmanaged
- Tillage and soil management:
  - Tillage type (conventional, minimum, none)
  - Controlled traffic? Tramline width & spacing
  - Limed? (liming status)
  - Organic/conventional and organic amendments
- Crop and rotation details:
  - Crop types / rotation
  - Cover crops? Herbal leys?
- Land use history and current practices by land type:
  - Arable (with/without grass), Grassland, Woodland
  - Buffer strips/zones
  - Field drainage, other practices
- Tree and vegetation details:
  - Tree species and age where applicable

## Field observations and surface conditions
- Surface form: flat, gentle, steep, undulating; slope shape; drainage-related indicators
- Surface condition: unslaked/slaked/slaked/capped; ponding or brown water runoff; erosion features (sheet, rill, gulley)
- Surface condition indicators related to tramlines and compaction:
  - Tramline wheelings, ruts
  - Poached ground
- Additional comments and any unrepresentative areas

## Sampling location and data capture notes
- Sampling location information (to be added as needed)
- Other comments and clarifications to aid data interpretation

## Data quality, interoperability, and governance considerations
- Metadata gaps or needs (to verify dataset suitability for policy evaluation)
- Data sharing considerations (public availability vs. sensitivity)
- Standards for data cleaning, transformation, and storage
- Governance implications (data ownership, provenance, versioning)

## How this supports monitoring framework aims
- Provides standardized, comparable field-level data across sites for environmental health indicators.
- Documents management practices and land-use changes linked to soil, drainage, and surface condition outcomes.
- Enables assessment of policy impacts on agricultural practices, hydrology, erosion risk, and water quality through consistent metadata and observations.
