# LANDWISE Broad-scale Field Survey - Record Sheet

## Overview
- A field data collection instrument for recording broad-scale land, soil, and management information at a site and field level.
- Captures both general site characteristics and detailed field/plot attributes to support analysis of land use, soil/geology, drainage, grazing, and surface conditions.
- Designed to document current practices, history, and observed conditions, enabling data discovery, comparison, and potential collaboration across networks.

## Data captured

- Identifiers and timing
  - Site name, Field name, Field/plot information, Field number
  - Date (DD/MM/YY)
  - Last grazed? (including the option to record past 5 years)
  - Last ploughed?
  - Sampling location information (where to record in the sheet)

- Land use and management (general)
  - Land use categories: Arable rotation with/without grass, Grassland (permanent, 5+ years), Woodland (broadleaf, mature)
  - Soil/geology class (with notes such as shallow over chalk/limestone, overlying deposits, etc.)
  - Drainage status: field drainage, impeded drainage, waterlogged conditions, floodplain/high groundwater indicators
  - Management history: land use history, flood history, organic/conventional practices, organic amendments, cover crops, herbal leys
  - Grazing and stocking: weeks grazing/year, livestock type, stocking density (head/ha), mob/paddock grazing, whether stock is out-wintered
  - Management specifics by land use: tillage (conventional/minimum/no till), controlled traffic, tramline width/spacing
  - Tree/woodland factors: tree species, age, managed vs unmanaged
  - Grassland specifics: grass species, buffer strips/zones, other comments

- Current management practices (by land-use category)
  - Arable: crop types/rotation, cover crops, other practices
  - Woodland: management practices, buffer practices
  - Grassland: grazing practices, stock management, cover crops
  - Additional: organic/conventional, organic amendments, other comments

- Additional field context
  - Water/sediment runoff indicators
  - Flooding and waterlogging history
  - Limitations/uncertainties: unrepresentative field areas, other comments

- Surface observations and preliminary measurements (General)
  - Surface form: flat, gentle, steep, undulating; furrowed/mounded/flattened; slope shape; water-related indicators
  - Surface condition: unslaked/slaked/capped; erosion features; tramline wheelings/ruts; poached ground
  - Erosion features and other surface observations

- Qualitative notes
  - Other comments
  - Any unrepresentative field areas

## Measurement approach and structure
- Two general observation blocks:
  - Block 1: site/field-level attributes including land use, soil/geology, drainage, and management practices
  - Block 2: surface form, condition, erosion indicators, and sampling location details
- Free-text fields accompany structured selections to capture nuances and context
- Superscripted notes (¹) provide clarifications for certain classifications (e.g., over gravel deposits, etc.)

## Data quality, metadata, and governance considerations
- Clear field labels and categories to facilitate consistent data capture across team members
- Several fields rely on qualitative assessment; standardization (codes, definitions) is important for comparability
- Notes and comments fields enable documenting exceptions, history, and context (e.g., unrepresentative areas)
- Superscript footnotes indicate the need to follow specific clarifications for certain classifications
- Important for discoverability and reuse: capture date formats, field identifiers, and location context to enable linking with other datasets (soil, drainage, land-use records)

## Alignment with Data Leaders' aims

- Whole-system view and user-focused design
  - Documents a comprehensive set of attributes needed to understand land use, soils, drainage, and management from field to landscape level
  - Facilitates synthesis with user needs (policy, management teams) through structured, annotatable data capture

- Data availability, gaps, and prioritization
  - Catalogs current practices and history, helping identify data gaps (e.g., missing soil class detail, drainage status, or grazing history)
  - Supports prioritization by highlighting areas with limited data or unrepresentative fields

- Data discoverability, quality, and metadata
  - Provides a defined schema with field names and categories that can be standardized and stored in a data platform
  - Encourages metadata-rich capture (dates, field IDs, sampling locations, comments) to aid verification and future reuse

- Data stewardship and governance
  - Emphasizes recording management practices, history, and surface observations that are critical for longitudinal analyses
  - Highlights the need for consistent data definitions and documentation to enable collaboration across networks

- Collaboration and community of practice
  - The structured yet flexible format supports sharing with partners, researchers, and practitioners
  - The presence of detailed management and surface observations helps establish common data standards and comparability

## Considerations and potential improvements for Data Leaders
- Introduce standardized coding schemes (e.g., for land-use categories, soil/geology classes, drainage status) to improve interoperability and reduce ambiguity
- Implement data validation rules and unit conventions to enhance data quality during capture
- Ensure robust metadata for all fields (definitions, allowable values, data lineage)
- Align with other datasets (soil maps, weather, land management records) to enable integrated analyses
- Provide guidance on handling missing data and clearly mark unrepresentative field areas to avoid misinterpretation
- Plan digital capture options to streamline input, reduce duplication, and support real-time data quality checks
