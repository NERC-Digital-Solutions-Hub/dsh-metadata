# Landwise Broad-scale Survey Lab Soil Analysis TEMPLATE

## Purpose and scope
- Document outlines equipment, lab spaces, sample labeling, and procedures for soil analyses (volumetric soil moisture, soil bulk density, soil organic matter by loss on ignition, calcareous soil test via HCl, slaking/dispersion, hand texture, and laser-based texture).
- Includes data handling steps, templates, and data storage conventions to support consistent record-keeping and data reuse.

## Data collection and recording
- Measurements and data types:
  - Volumetric soil moisture, soil bulk density (via oven drying) with detailed mass measurements (SOILMOIST, SOIL105, VOLRING, etc.).
  - Soil organic matter by loss on ignition (SOIL105, SOIL400, CRUCIBLE).
  - HCl test results for calcareous soil (qualitative class categories).
  - Slaking and dispersion scores (0–4 scale) and hand texture classifications.
  - Texture analysis data from laser diffraction (MS2000) including obscuration levels and replicate checks.
  - Descriptive notes, start/end times, and oven/furnace conditions.
- Data recording requirements:
  - Use a Landwise lab spreadsheet template to transfer measured values.
  - File naming: site name and field number (e.g., UoR Sonning Field 1… .xlsx).
  - Save completed spreadsheets under NEC06345_LANDWISE\Broad-scale Survey Site Data; scan and save printouts to the same folder.
  - Ensure traceability between field sample bags and lab trays using labeled correspondence recorded on the spreadsheet printout.

## Data governance and standards
- Standardized labeling and traceability:
  - Lab tray labels link to field sample bag labels (site code, field code, sample location, V/A, date/time).
  - Use project-specific prefixes and consistent sample IDs (e.g., V and A sample designations).
- Documentation and provenance:
  - Record instrument calibrations, balance checks (0.1 g precision; 0.001 g precision for SOM), and oven usage in logs.
  - Follow and reference standard SOPs and QA steps (e.g., Soil3_HydroG for MS2000 measurements; blue folder SOPs for QA).
- Data accessibility and discoverability:
  - Centralized storage on LAN with per-site sub-folders; standardized file names and folder structure.
  - Scanned printouts maintained alongside digital data for auditability.

## Data quality controls
- Instrument and measurement QC:
  - Balance calibration checks at session start; verify tray masses (3.8 g ± 0.1 g) and cross-contamination controls.
  - Three replicates for HydroG measurements; consistency checks across replicates.
  - Obscuration targets (e.g., 10–40% with optimum around 35% for coarse materials).
- Sampling and handling controls:
  - Strict labeling, segregation of V and A samples, and prompt weighing to minimize moisture exchange.
  - Avoid contamination during crucible handling and oven drying; weigh hot to minimize reabsorption of moisture.
- Data integrity:
  - Transfer data from field/printouts to digital spreadsheets; ensure headers and units are preserved for downstream analysis.

## Data storage and metadata
- Metadata requirements:
  - Site code, field number, sample type (V or A), tray/crucible IDs, dates, start/end times, oven/furnace details, and disposal notes.
- Storage conventions:
  - Digital: NEC06345_LANDWISE\Broad-scale Survey Site Data; site-specific .xlsx files.
  - Physical: labelled field bags and foil trays tracked to corresponding lab records.
- Archiving and backup:
  - Completed spreadsheets scanned and saved in the same site folder; data exported from MS2000 to Excel and stored in project folders; maintain multiple copies (memory stick/central drive).

## Data flow and responsibilities
- Roles:
  - Data stewards ensure standardized data capture, labeling, and deposition consistent with the template.
  - Collaboration with data creators/sharers to maintain metadata quality and timely data transfer.
- Data lifecycle:
  - Collect samples, perform analyses, record results in the template, generate printable spreadsheets, and archive both digital and scanned copies.
  - Discard or retain samples per protocol after analysis; retain additional samples for colour analysis or other follow-up as noted.

## Appendix: data handling highlights
- Calculations (examples):
  - Volumetric soil moisture and bulk density derived from mass measurements and known densities.
  - Soil organic matter percent calculated from soil masses before/after ignition.
- MS2000 workflow:
  - Pre-measure calibration, background checks, replicate measurements, and data export into a dedicated Excel workbook.
  - Ensure appropriate obscuration and replicate consistency before finalizing results.
- Safety and maintenance notes (accessory governance):
  - Document furnace and desiccant handling, HCl preparation, and disposal procedures; maintain logs for safety-critical operations.
  - Follow guidance for desiccant reactivation and silica gel handling, with emphasis on preventing contamination and exposure.

Note: This summary focuses on data governance, metadata, and data management requirements embedded in the lab protocol to support Data Stewards in maintaining standards, traceability, and accessibility of soil analysis datasets.
