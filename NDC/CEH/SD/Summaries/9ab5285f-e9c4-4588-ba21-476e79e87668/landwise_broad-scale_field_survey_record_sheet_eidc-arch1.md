# LANDWISE Broad-scale Field Survey - Record Sheet

## Purpose and scope
- A standardized field data collection form for broad-scale surveys of land use, management, soil/geology class, drainage, and field surface conditions.
- Designed to support analyses of how land management and soil characteristics relate to hydrology, erosion, and other environmental outcomes.

## Data collected

- Site and plot identifiers
  - Site name, Field name, Field/plot information
  - Date, Field no., Last ploughed
  - Any unrepresentative field areas
- Land use and management
  - Land use categories: Arable rotation with grass, Arable rotation without grass, Grassland (permanent, ≥5 years), Woodland (broadleaf, mature)
  - Soil/Geology Class (with examples of overlying deposits and drainage implications)
  - Grazing history: Weeks grazing per year
  - Stocking details: Livestock type, Stocking density (head/ha), Stock out-wintered, Mob/paddock grazing
  - Liming history
  - Tillage: Conventional, Minimum, None
  - Controlled Traffic and Tramline width/spacing
  - Age and Path management
  - Current management practices (separate for Arable, Woodland, Grassland)
  - Field drainage and Buffer strips/zones
  - Grass species; Crop types/rotation; Cover crops; Herbal leys
  - Organic/conventional practices and Organic amendments
  - Land use history; Flooding history; Waterlogged (>1 week/year)
  - Water/sediment runoff; Other comments
- Observations and measurements of field conditions
  - Surface form: Flat, gentle, steep, undulating (and related features like furrowed/mounded/flattened)
  - Surface form features: Slope shape linked to ponded water or brown water runoff
  - Surface condition: Unsla ked/slaked/slaked/capped
  - Erosion features and surface conditions (sheet/rill/gully, etc.)
  - Tramline wheelings/ruts, Poached ground, Other surface conditions
- Sampling location information
  - Additional details to locate and describe sampling points

## Practical considerations for analysts
- Emphasis on consistent coding and detailed field/plot identifiers to enable cross-site analyses.
- A comprehensive set of variables to enable modelling of relationships between land management, soil/geology, drainage, flood risk, and surface conditions.
- Expect potential data gaps (e.g., unrepresentative areas, missing responses) and complexity due to multiple land-use categories and management practices.
