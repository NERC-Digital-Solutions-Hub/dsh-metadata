# Aim Quantify the impact of different land use and management strategies on key soil properties that affect infiltration and water storage across the main soils type in the West Thames catchment.

## Purpose
- Define the sampling strategy and associated field and laboratory methods to determine selected near-surface soil properties and vegetation characteristics of predominantly agricultural fields under various land-based Natural Flood Management (NFM) measures.
- Targeted properties/characteristics: soil texture, soil organic matter (SOM), soil volumetric water content (VWC), soil dry bulk density (BD), vegetation type/height/cover, soil aggregate stability (slaking & dispersion test), and soil structure (Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure; VESS).

## Sampling design: fixed effects and covariates
- Fixed effects (land use and management to be controlled):
  - Land use: Arable, Grassland (permanent, established >5 years), Woodland (broadleaf, mature)
  - Management (sub-class of arable): Arable rotation with grass, Arable rotation without grass
- Covariates / random effects (factors likely to influence outcomes):
  - Management practices, Crop types, Rotation, Organic vs Conventional Tillage, Min Till, No Till, Cover Crops, Controlled Traffic, Field Drainage, Flooding History, plus other unknown factors

## Soil types and survey framing
- Five broad soil types on carbonate and mudstone geology (as defined for LANDWISE framework)
- Field sampling aims to cover the combinations of soil type × land use × management, ideally 20 combinations (4 land use/management classes × 5 soil types)
- Target replication: about 8 fields per combination (total ~160 fields)
- Practical constraints: may vary by field availability; avoid pseudo-replication by sampling at most one field per soil/land-use cell per farm, but multiple fields in same soil/land-use cell may be sampled if management is distinctly different

## Field sampling plan and replication
- Objective: sample across soil-type/land-use/management cells with balanced representation
- Field cell design note: want equal representation across cells; adjust by site availability
- Sampling density: up to 2000 samples in total (subject to field availability and replication balance)

## Sampling locations and sample types per field
- Grassland:
  - 15 sample locations per field (3 VESS spots across different sub-areas)
  - 10 fixed samples per field for VESS and associated measurements
  - 5 Trafficked and 5 Untrafficked locations (trafficked locations prioritized to capture variability)
- Woodland:
  - WD sampling locations include WD-M (mineral) and WD-O (organic) components
  - 1 VESS per field from each category (trafficked, untrafficked, and in-field if applicable)
- General layout:
  - 6 or 12 sample locations per grid cell (min 0.25 ha)
  - 6 surface mineral soil layer samples and 6 surface organic layer samples (if present)
  - 1 VESS per WD sampling location
  - Additional small samples from grid cells around each WD-M/WD-O location for SOM, slaking, texture, etc. (bulked per grid cell)
- Sample counts per field related to land use:
  - Grassland: 5 Trafficked + 5 Untrafficked locations (each with VESS), plus 5 V samples and 5 A (additional) samples
  - Woodland: WD-M and WD-O samples grouped by grid cell, with VESS scoring at designated locations
- Grid cell sampling focuses on capturing variation while avoiding sampling near tree stems, animal burrows, or recent disturbances

## On-site sampling actions and methods
- Pre-survey (planning):
  - Obtain landowner consent, maps, and discuss possible fields
  - Ensure fields have not been ploughed recently
  - Prepare maps (OS, soil maps, Defra MAGIC) and exclude designated areas
  - Agree sampling date/time and provide contact details
- On-site setup:
  - Collect consent, complete land management questionnaire, and demonstrate sampling technique if needed
  - Assess field shape and plan W-walks and sampling locations
  - Take field photos and record location data (GPS/BNG coordinates to the nearest metre or six decimal places for lat/long)
- Sampling procedure (per location):
  - Use a 50 mm diameter sampling ring to collect near-surface (0-51 mm bgl) samples
  - If the surface organic layer is >50 mm deep, collect both an organic layer sample (0-50 mm) and a mineral layer sample (0-50 mm) after clearing surface material
  - If organic layer is <50 mm, collect a single mineral layer sample and a separate 0-50 mm mineral excess sample from a grid cell
  - For VESS: follow field method sheet and record results; take photos before/after block break-up
  - For each field: group samples by field with appropriate labeling
  - Maintain clean equipment, label bags, and document sampling times (GMT)
- Sample types and labeling:
  - V = Volumetric fixed-volume samples (BD/VWC)
  - A = Additional samples (0-50 mm bgl) for supplementary analyses (SOM, texture, etc.)
  - WD-M = Woodland mineral soil samples
  - WD-O = Woodland organic layer samples (when present)
- Documentation:
  - Record field ID, field/plot notes, exact GPS coordinates, vegetation cover, height, and other observations on the Landwise field survey record
  - Capture both general and location-specific photos, and preserve chain-of-custody for samples

## Post-survey actions and data management
- Data handling:
  - Transcribe field survey records into electronic formats
  - Scan and archive original field records and attach to field folders
  - Organize photos by date and field
- Sample handling:
  - Temporary storage of samples in a cool, dark place; ship in batches to CEH for storage
  - Store at CEH in appropriate fridge facilities
  - Notify CEH and UoR when and where to deliver samples
- Data governance and transparency:
  - Ensure outputs and underlying data are shareable in line with data governance standards
  - Prepare outputs that can be shared and interpreted by stakeholders and policy makers

## Laboratory analyses and texture assessment
- Laboratory analyses (when required):
  - Particle Size Distribution (to determine texture fractions)
  - Organic matter content (OM)
- Texture classification:
  - Use hand-texturing methods to assign texture classes in the field and/or lab
  - If lab results are used, translate into texture groups suitable for agricultural operations (e.g., sandy/light silty, medium, heavy)
- Texture and calcareous content notes:
  - Include considerations for calcium carbonate content and reactions (e.g., HCl-based assessments) where relevant for calcareous soils

## Practical notes on methodology
- Soil texture identification by hand (described flowcharts and feel tests) to categorize sands, loams, clays, and mixtures
- Emphasis on avoiding misclassification due to mineralogical differences (e.g., chalk/calcium carbonate effects on texture and behavior)
- Documentation of methods and flows to enable reproducibility and transparency for monitoring framework authors

## Safety, logistics, and field readiness
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety considerations included (boots, gloves, hi-vis, etc.)
- Equipment and maps required for fieldwork (soil rings, bags, GPS, camera, etc.)
- Travel details, contact information, and emergency planning (A&E route, hospital details)

## Key links and references
- Soilscapes and Landwise materials (for soil-type classifications and field mapping)
- Defra MAGIC maps and soil datasets for site selection and exclusion of designated areas

Note: The document provides a comprehensive, field-tested framework for assessing how land use and management influence near-surface soil properties relevant to infiltration and water storage, with explicit instructions on sampling design, field procedures, data handling, and downstream laboratory analyses. It also emphasizes data governance, stakeholder engagement, and practical considerations to minimize biases and ensure reproducibility across sites and time.
