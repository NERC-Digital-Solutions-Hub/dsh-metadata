# LANDWISE Broad-scale Field Survey - Record Sheet

## Overview
- A field data collection instrument for LANDWISE broad-scale surveys.
- Designed to capture standardized, map-relevant information about site and field characteristics, land use/management, soil and geology classes, drainage, and surface features to support GIS-based mapping and analysis.

## Data fields and structure
- General and identifiers
  - Site name, Field name, Field/plot information, Field no., Date (DD/MM/YY)
  - Any unrepresentative field areas, Last ploughed
- Field observations and site characteristics
  - Field/plot general observations; surface form (flat, gentle, steep, undulating), slope shape, surface water indicators
  - Erosion and deposition features, surface condition and tramline indicators (wheelings, ruts), poached ground
  - Sampling location information (and space to add details)
- Land use and management
  - Arable rotation with grass vs. without grass, Grassland (permanent, 5+ years), Woodland (broadleaf, mature)
  - Grass and livestock management (grass species, livestock type, stocking density, mob/paddock grazing, feed, cover crops, herbal leys)
  - Organic vs. conventional, organic amendments, crop types/rotations, buffer strips/zones
  - Flooding/waterlogging history, water/sediment runoff, field drainage, other comments
  - Land use history, last grazed (timeframe), weeks grazing per year
- Soil and geology (LANDWISE Soil and Geology Class)
  - Soil/geo categories (e.g., shallow over chalk/limestone, free-draining loamy over chalk/limestone, impeded drainage loamy/clayey over chalk/limestone, floodplain/mudstone, etc.)
  - Deposits (e.g., gravel overlying mudstone) and related notes
- Management practices (by land type)
  - Specific practices for Arable, Woodlands, Grassland, including drainage, buffer zones, cover crops, organic practices, amendments
- Hydrology and drainage
  - Field drainage status, waterlogged years, flood history, runoff indicators
- Additional comments
  - Space for unstructured notes and observations

## GIS relevance
- Provides spatially-referenced attributes linked to field boundaries and plots (site name, field name, field no., sampling location).
- Captures land use, soil/geology classes, drainage, surface features, and management practices suitable for creating and updating GIS layers (polygons, symbols, and attribute tables).
- Enables mapping of surface forms, erosion indicators, tramline patterns, and water-related features for spatial analysis and decision making.
- Structured data supports reproducible map-based data products for policy, client, or public audiences.

## Data quality, standards, and challenges
- Potential issues include data distributed across multiple sources, inconsistent terminology, and varying resolutions.
- Requires clear definitions, consistent data entry, and data cleaning/transformations to integrate into GIS.
- Unrepresentative field areas and missing data (e.g., sampling location details) may affect spatial analyses; prompts for notes and explicit fields to mitigate gaps.

## Workflow and usage
- On-site data capture via tick boxes and text fields, with dates and location details filled in.
- Post-fieldwork: verify, standardize terms, and integrate into GIS datasets for mapping and analysis.
- Iterative use with end-user feedback to refine data collection and improve map-based outputs.
