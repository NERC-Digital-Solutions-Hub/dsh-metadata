# Landwise Broad-scale Survey Lab Soil Analysis TEMPLATE

## Purpose and outputs
- Provides a standardized protocol for soil analyses to produce data on volumetric soil moisture, soil bulk density, soil organic matter, calcareous content, soil structure (slaking/dispersion), texture, and colour.
- Data are recorded in the Landwise Broad-scale Survey Lab Soil Analysis TEMPLATE spreadsheets and archived in site-specific folders for integration into broader datasets.

## Equipment and laboratories (summary)
- Glass foil trays, desiccators with silica gel, precision balances, muffle furnace, drying ovens, crucibles, furnace heat mats, pestle and mortar, lab trolleys, markers, gloves, and PPE.
- Dedicated labs: Ovens Balance Room (volumetric moisture, bulk density, organic matter), Soil Hydrology Lab (slaking/dispersion, hand texturing, temporary storage), Chemistry Lab (HCl test for calcareous soil).
- Essential lab records: the LANDWISE Lab Soil Analysis spreadsheet printouts and corresponding field-to-lab correspondence.

## Sample labelling and traceability
- Separate field sample bags and lab-tray labels using consistent coding (e.g., V for volumetric samples, A for organic matter samples; site code, field number, sample numbers).
- Ensure exact correspondence between field labels and lab tray labels; record all mappings in the Landwise spreadsheet printout.
- Crucibles, trays, and sample IDs must be tracked to maintain data provenance.

## Data capture and data products
- Outputs captured as numerical data and qualitative scores, intended for self-serve data products and reporting:
  - Volumetric soil moisture and soil bulk density (using oven-drying method) with derived metrics:
    - VOLWATER, VOLRING, VOLSAMPLE, gravimetric moisture, volumetric moisture content.
    - Bulk density (dry) from sample mass and volume.
  - Soil organic matter (loss on ignition) with OM (%) calculation.
  - HCl test results for calcareous soil, categorized into classes of effervescence.
  - Slaking and dispersion scores (0–4) from visual dispersion tests after immersion.
  - Hand texture classifications (texture feel categories).
  - Texture analysis by sieving and laser particle sizer (MS2000) with replication checks and obscuration targets.
  - Soil colour samples for downstream analysis.
- All data are entered into the Landwise spreadsheet templates and later exported to project folders and data repositories.

## Procedures (highlights by method)
- Volumetric moisture and bulk density
  - Pre-check balances for precision; weigh samples and trays; oven-dry at 105°C for ~36–60 hours.
  - Weigh dry material promptly to avoid atmospheric moisture gain.
  - Calculate VOLWATER, VOLRING, and bulk density from weights and known volumes.
  - Record all steps and oven logs; reuse foil trays with mass checks.
- Soil organic matter (loss on ignition)
  - Dry sub-samples, crush and sieve; weigh ~4 g samples into pre-weighed crucibles.
  - Ignite crucibles at 400°C for ~16 hours; weigh post-ignition to determine OM.
  - OM (%) calculated from SOIL105 and SOIL400 values; adhere to safety and desiccation procedures.
- HCl test for calcareous soil
  - Prepare fresh 20% HCl solution from stock; apply to crushed soil; classify calcareous content by visible effervescence.
  - Follow NE Soil texture testing guidelines; discard samples safely after assessment.
- Slaking and dispersion
  - Use aggregate soil in DI water; score dispersion after 10 minutes and 2 hours on a 0–4 scale.
  - Understand the difference between slaking and dispersion and their implications for soil structure interpretation.
- Hand texturing
  - Obtain a field-moist crumb; knead and assess particle feel to classify texture.
- Texture by sieving and laser (MS2000)
  - Prepare subsamples with dispersant (sodium hexametaphosphate), mix, and allow hydration.
  - Run MS2000 with replicated measurements; ensure obscuration levels (target around 10–40% with batch-specific adjustments).
  - Record replicate consistency and export results to the central data file.
- Additional notes on colour, storage, and post-analysis handling
  - Retain small air-dried samples for colour analysis; return remaining material to bags.
  - Analyze samples promptly (ideally within one month after collection); maintain safe furnace and ventilation practices.

## Data management, QA, and archiving
- Data integrity: use calibrated balances, record start/end times, and log oven/furnace usage.
- Replicates and quality control: perform replicate measurements (e.g., MS2000 runs) and check for consistency before finalizing data.
- Data transfer: migrate results from lab printouts into the Landwise spreadsheet; save with site name and field number in the Broad-scale Survey Site Data folder.
- Archiving: scan completed printouts and save with consistent naming; export MS2000 data and store alongside other results.
- Data handover: maintain a clear trail from field collection to laboratory analysis to final data product, suitable for sharing with data users and publicly communicating results where appropriate.

## Notes, safety, and compliance
- Samples should be collected from a walk-in fridge; analyze promptly to minimize degradation.
- Safety: careful furnace/desiccator handling, use of silica gel, and proper waste disposal (acid labs, sinks with running water for effluents).
- Silica gel desiccants: reactivation by heating when expired; avoid inhalation of dusts; use PPE.
