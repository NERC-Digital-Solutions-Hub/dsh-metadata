Quantify the impact of different land use and management strategies on key soil properties that affect infiltration and water storage across the main soils type in the West Thames catchment.

## Overview
- Defines sampling strategy and field/laboratory methods to determine near-surface soil properties and vegetation in predominantly agricultural fields under various land-based Natural Flood Management (NFM) measures.
- Targeted properties: soil texture, soil organic matter (SOM), volumetric water content (VWC), bulk density (BD), vegetation type/height/cover, soil aggregate stability (slaking/dispersion test), and soil structure (Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure; VESS).

## Data collected and variables
- Field observations and measurements:
  - Near-surface soil samples (0–51 mm bgl) and, when applicable, organic layer samples (0–50 mm bgl).
  - Laboratory data: particle size distribution and SOM; VESS assessments; texture classification.
  - Vegetation data: type, height, cover.
  - Sample metadata: field ID, field coordinates, sampling location type, date/time.
- Data products:
  - VESS scores, texture group classifications, and descriptive soil-type categorizations.
  - Photographs and maps (farm field maps, OS/SoilScapes, MAGIC overlays).

## Sampling design and stratification
- Fixed effects (driven by study aims):
  - Land use: Arable, Grassland (permanent, >5 years), Woodland (broadleaf, mature).
  - Management within arable: Rotation with grass, Rotation without grass.
- Covariates/random effects (uncontrolled but influential):
  - Management practices, crop types, rotation schemes, tillage (organic, conventional, min till, no till), cover crops, controlled traffic, field drainage, flooding history, and other unknown factors.
- Soil type stratification:
  - Five broad soils types on carbonate and mudstone geology (e.g., shallow chalk/limestone; free-draining loamy; impeded drainage loamy/clayey; free-draining sandy/loamy; naturally wet/sandy-loamy; slowly permeable loamy/clayey; floodplain loamy/clayey).
- Sampling balance goals:
  - Ideally 20 soil-type x land-use/management combinations with replication (e.g., 8 replicates per cell, total ~160 fields), subject to field availability and logistical limits (up to ~2000 samples overall).
  - Practical constraint: aim for one field/plot per table cell per farm; may sample multiple fields at a site if management differs.

## Field sampling layout and locations
- Grassland sampling pattern (example):
  - 15 sample locations per field: 5 infield, 5 trafficked (tramlines/headlands), 5 untrafficked margins.
  - 3 VESS assessments (one from IN, TR, UN).
  - Total: 10 primary sampling locations per field (5 trafficked, 5 untrafficked) with 2 VESS; grid-cell samples added for organic/mineral layers as applicable.
- Woodland and other soils follow a similar architecture with site-appropriate adjustments:
  - 6 or 12 sampling locations per plot, covering surface mineral and/or organic layers.
  - Specific VESS sampling aligned with trafficked vs. untrafficked areas.
- Sampling location criteria:
  - Trafficked samples chosen to capture variability across the field (not all from same area).
  - Untrafficked samples chosen to avoid disturbance and edge effects (trees/hedges/animal burrows).
- Fixed volume sampling and depths:
  - 0–51 mm (50 mm ring) for BD/VWC, with protocol to ensure consistent ring depth and careful handling to avoid compaction.
  - Additional 0–50 mm samples for SOM, texture, and other analyses, depending on organic layer depth.
  - VESS sampling at defined locations when applicable.

## Pre-survey and field setup
- Landowner/manager engagement and consent:
  - Information sheet, consent forms, and field management questionnaire.
  - Verify current land management and NFM measures; confirm access and absence of recent ploughing (within last month).
- Site selection and mapping:
  - Gather farm maps, OS maps, SoilScapes/soil maps, and Defra MAGIC overlays.
  - Exclude fields with mixed soils or designated areas; aim for consistent soil-type representation.
- Field labeling and logistics:
  - Prepare sample bags (V for fixed-volume, A for additional samples) and a clear labeling scheme (farm, field, sampling location, sample code).
  - Plan travel, meet-up arrangements, emergency contacts, and routes to nearest hospital.

## On-site sampling procedure
- Documentation and setup:
  - Take field photos (field ID card and general context).
  - Record GPS coordinates (BNG to nearest metre or lat/long to 6 decimals) and vegetation cover with photos.
  - Complete field/plot observations on standardized record sheets.
- Sampling execution:
  - Prepare and insert 50 mm rings, expose ground surface, and ensure accurate sample volume.
  - Label and bag each fixed-volume sample (V) with date/time; follow with additional samples (A) from adjacent soil.
  - For VESS locations, follow respective method sheets and record results.
- Post-sampling handling:
  - Group and label samples by field; clean equipment between sites; provide field notes on soil conditions and potential constraints.
  - Inform landowner/manager when leaving.

## Data management, storage, and workflow
- Data capture and digitization:
  - Convert field record sheets to electronic versions; scan originals and organize by field/date (e.g., UoR Sonning/YYYY_MM_DD Field 1).
- Data organization and storage:
  - Temporary storage of soil samples in a cool, dark place; arrange batch returns to CEH Wallingford (storage fridge on site as needed).
  - Transfer electronic data and scanned forms to CEH/UoR with participant consent forms and associated photos.
- Data sharing and stewardship:
  - Maintain consistent naming conventions for fields, samples, and sites.
  - Implement QA steps to minimize pseudo-replication (one field/plot per table cell per farm) and ensure traceability through the data lineage (farm → field → sampling location → lab results).
  - Ensure data are discoverable and usable for future researchers by preserving metadata, methodology details, and condition notes.

## Laboratory analysis and texture assessment
- Analyses:
  - Particle Size Distribution (soil texture) and Organic Matter (OM) data; optional texture classification via standard texture triangles.
- Hand texture assessment:
  - Practical, in-field hand texturing guidance to classify texture classes (e.g., sands, loams, clays) with caveats regarding mineralogical variations (chalk/calcium carbonate effects).
- Documentation and interpretation:
  - Record texture groupings and, if required, obtain additional laboratory results for robust texture classification.
  - Use standard classifications (e.g., sandy/loamy, medium/heavy) to support agricultural management implications.

## Appendices and technical notes
- Soil texture identification and interpretation guidance, including hand-texture flow charts and descriptions for sands, loams, clays, and calcareous influences.
- Calcium carbonate content estimation framework (HCl-related guidance) and interpretation scales for calcareous sediments.

## Data governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Data scope and standards:
  - Clearly defined data types (field observations, coordinates, photos, lab results, VESS scores, vegetation metrics) and standardized formats.
- Metadata and provenance:
  - Comprehensive metadata capturing sampling date/time, field IDs, GPS coordinates, soil type, land-use class, management, sample IDs (V/A/WD-M/WD-O), and grid-cell context.
- Data quality and reproducibility:
  - Standardized sampling depths, ring dimensions, and handling protocols to enable reproducibility across sites.
  - QA processes to prevent pseudo-replication and ensure consistent field procedures.
- Data storage and sharing:
  - Centralized storage at CEH/UoR with clear folder structure (farm/field/date), versioned electronic records, and scanned originals.
  - Retention of consent forms and participant information for governance and compliance.
- Data accessibility:
  - Ensure data are discoverable, with clear documentation of methods, sampling design, and analysis approaches to facilitate reuse by other researchers and practitioners.

## Endnotes
