# Landwise Broad-scale Survey Lab Soil Analysis TEMPLATE

## Aim
- Provide a standardized protocol to measure environmental soil properties in a consistent format, enabling scrutiny of soil health and policy performance over time.
- Generate outputs suitable for reports, maps, and charts; store datasets in designated portals for reuse and access.

## What the document covers
- Equipment and laboratory setup for soil analysis
- Sample labeling schemes and data recording requirements
- Procedures and calculations for:
  - Volumetric soil moisture and soil bulk density by oven drying
  - Soil organic matter (SOM) by loss on ignition (LOI)
  - HCl test for calcareous soil
  - Slaking and dispersion test
  - Hand texturing
  - Texture analysis by sieving and laser particle sizing (MS2000)
- Data management, file naming, and submission to project folders
- Safety notes, handling of desiccants, furnaces, and samples
- References supporting the methods

## Equipment and laboratories
- Equipment essentials include foil sample trays, desiccators, precision balances, muffle furnace, drying ovens, porcelain crucibles, furnaces, pestle and mortar, trolleys, markers, gloves, and lab coats.
- Laboratories involved:
  - Ovens Balance Room: volumetric moisture, bulk density, SOM analyses
  - Soil Hydrology Lab: slaking and dispersion, hand texturing, temporary sample storage
  - Chemistry Lab Acid Fume Cupboard: HCl test for calcareous soil
- Sample labeling and cross-checks with corresponding field bags are mandatory to ensure traceability.

## Sample labeling and data recording
- Volumetric moisture (V samples) labeling: 3-letter site code, field number, and 'V' sample number (e.g., SON F1 V1)
- Soil organic matter (A samples) labeling: 3-letter site code, field number, and 'A' sample number (e.g., SON F1 A1)
- Ensure correspondence between lab tray labels and field bag labels is recorded in the Landwise Broad-scale Survey Lab Soil Analysis spreadsheet, saved with site and field identifiers.

## Procedures, key steps, and calculations

### Volumetric soil moisture and soil bulk density by oven drying (V samples)
- Verify balance precision (0.1 g) prior to use; weigh each 'V' sample in sealed bag to 0.1 g.
- Weigh empty foil tray and place soil into tray; weigh combined sample+tray to 0.1 g.
- Dry in oven at 105°C for ~36–60 hours; record start/end times.
- Weigh dry sample+tray immediately after removal (to avoid moisture uptake).
- Calculate:
  - Volumetric water volume: VOLWATER = (SOILMOIST - SOIL105) / 1
  - Volumetric sample volume: VOLRING = 100.1 cm3
  - Gravimetric moisture: (SOILMOIST - SOIL105) / SOIL105
  - Volumetric moisture: VOLWATER / VOLRING
  - Bulk density (dry): SOIL105 / VOLRING
- Data handling: transfer values to site-specific spreadsheet; save and scan the completed printout.
- Tray reuse: keeps mass ~3.8 g ± 0.1 g; relabel for next use.

### Soil organic matter by loss on ignition (LOI; 'A' samples)
- Air-dry ~60 g sub-sample; crush to <0.4 mm; weigh ~4 g into crucibles.
- Dry soil at 105°C ~36–60 hours; prepare crucibles by heating to 400°C beforehand.
- Weigh crucibles (pre/post) to 0.001 g; weigh approx. 4 g soil per crucible for LOI.
- After LOI, calculate OM: Organic matter (%) = ((SOIL105 - SOIL400) / SOIL105) × 100
- Data handling: record in spreadsheet; ensure dusty trays are avoided; preserve unburnt samples as needed.

### HCl test for calcareous soil
- Prepare HCl 20% solution from concentrated stock; follow safety protocols.
- Use clean labelled beakers; add soil sample to beaker; add HCl; classify calcareous content by visible effervescence (None to Strong).

### Slaking and dispersion test
- Use air-dried aggregates in beakers with DI water; record dispersion after 10 minutes and 2 hours on a 0–4 scale (0 = no dispersion; 4 = complete dispersion).

### Hand texturing
- Take a moist soil sample; knead to assess texture by feel; record texture class abbreviations.

### Texture by sieving and laser particle sizing (MS2000)
- Prepare 0.5–1.0 g of additional sample in falcon tube with 5 ml 5% sodium hexametaphosphate; dilute to 50 ml with DI water.
- After mixing and settling, optionally sonicate to break aggregates.
- MS2000 startup, background check, and measurement:
  - Run three replicates per sample; ensure obscuration is within 10–40% (target ~35% for coarse; adjust weight if needed).
  - Save data in the MS2000 format (.mea) and export to Excel; store alongside other project data.

## Data management and storage
- Name spreadsheets with site name and field number (e.g., UoR Sonning Field 1… .xlsx).
- Save to the designated Landwise Broad-scale Survey Site Data folder and scan and save copies in the same location.
- Maintain logs of oven/furnace usage, and ensure air extraction systems are operational.
- Data accessibility: ensure underlying data and outputs are stored in accessible portals or repositories for reuse and scrutiny.

## Notes and safety
- Collect samples from the walk-in fridge; analyze promptly (ideally within a month).
- Safety around furnaces, desiccants (silica gel Rubin), and acidic reagents; handle hot crucibles with tongs; avoid oil contamination on crucibles.
- Silica gel Rubin can be reactivated by heating to red/pink; replace blue indicating silica gel due to carcinogenic dust concerns.
- Oven usage should be booked in advance; record all operations in log books; maintain airflow and ventilation.
