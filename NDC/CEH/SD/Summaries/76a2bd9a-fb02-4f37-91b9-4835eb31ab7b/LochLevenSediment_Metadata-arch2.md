# LochLeven_SedimentDataset.csv

## Purpose and Context
- Supports analysis of cycling of phosphorus between bed sediments and the overlying water column in Loch Leven (2004–2005).
- Includes indicators of benthic algal community biomass.
- Loch Leven described as a lowland, shallow, eutrophic freshwater lake in Scotland, UK.
- Dataset has been used in publications about phosphorus mobilisation and the role of benthic microalgae in regulating this process.

## Sampling regime and sites
- Sampling conducted monthly from April 2004 to April 2005.
- Six permanent sites along a water-depth transect.
- Depths across sites: 2.0, 2.5, 3.5, 5.5, 10.0, and 22.0 meters.
- On each visit, measurements taken in the field or later in the lab.
- Site list includes OS grid references and depth; each site has a specified data count.

## Determinand measurements
- In situ/field measurements: Dissolved Oxygen (%sat) at Surface, Bottom, Pore, and Sediment; Conductivity (mS/cm); pH; Temperature (°C).
- Water column analyses: Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP, µg/L); Total soluble phosphorus (TSP); Total phosphorus (TP, µg/L); NH4-N (µg/L); Silica (SiO2, mg/L); Chlorophyll a (µg/L; and µg/g dry weight).
- Sediment measurements and fractions: SRP, TSP, and TP by location (Surface, Bottom, Pore, Sediment) with multiple sediment-associated fractions including labile P, reductant-soluble P, metal-oxide P, organic P, apatite-bound P, residual P, and total P per gdw (various units).

## Sampling, measurement and analysis methods
- Monthly sampling from four seasons across six depth sites; both surface and bottom waters sampled; cores collected with Jenkin sampler.
- In situ measurements using Hydrolab probes for water temperature, DO%, conductivity, pH.
- Laboratory processing includes filtration (Whatman GF/C), pigment analysis from filters, and chemical analyses.
- SRP and TP determined by colorimetric methods following Murphy & Riley (1962) and Wetzel & Likens (2000) with digestion steps for TP.
- NH4-N analyzed by phenol-hypochlorite method; SRSiO2 by Golterman et al. method.
- Chlorophyll a quantified spectrophotometrically with pigment correction.
- Sediment P fractionation performed via sequential chemical extraction (Psenner et al. 1988; Farmer et al. 1994) across five extraction steps to partition P pools (labile, reductant-soluble, metal-oxide adsorbed, apatite-bound, residual), plus calculations for organic P from NaOH extracts.
- Extraction steps conducted in the dark at 20°C; supernatants collected after centrifugation and filtration.

## Data format and storage
- Data stored in a single ASCII CSV file.
- Columns include: Site, Depth, Month, Date, DO (%sat), Cond (mS/cm), pH, Temp (°C), SRP (µg/L), TSP (µg/L), TP (µg/L), NH4 (µg/L), SiO2 (mg/L), Chl a (µg/L), SRP (µg/L), TSP (µg/L), TP (µg/gdw or related), NH4-N (µg/L), labile P (mg P/gdw), red sol (mg/gdw), red sol surp (mg/gdw), Metal oxide (mg/gdw), Organic (mg/gdw), apatite bound (mg/gdw), Residual (mg/gdw), TP (mg/gdw), Chlorophyll a (µg/gdw).
- Metadata and references accompany the dataset.

## Temporal and spatial coverage
- Temporal: April 2004 – April 2005 (12 months).
- Spatial: Six shore-to-deep-water sites across a depth transect (2.0–22.0 m) in Loch Leven.

## Applications and usage
- Facilitates understanding of internal phosphorus loading and sediment-water interactions.
- Enables assessment of how benthic microalgae influence phosphorus mobilisation.
- Used to support environmental monitoring, water quality management, and policy discussions around eutrophication and sediment processes.

## Access, reuse and references
- Data supported by established methods and standards (APHA; Wetzel & Likens; Murphy & Riley; Golterman et al.; Psenner et al.; Farmer et al.).
- References include multiple Spears et al. studies on Loch Leven and related phosphorus dynamics.
- Encouraged to combine with other datasets for expanded environmental monitoring value and to provide broader data access.
