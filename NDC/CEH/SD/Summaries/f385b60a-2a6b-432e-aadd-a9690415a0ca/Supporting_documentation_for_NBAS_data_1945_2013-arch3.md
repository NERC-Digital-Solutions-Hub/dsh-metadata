# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from North Basin of Windermere 1945 to 2013

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring dataset from the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Covers surface temperature, surface oxygen saturation, Secchi depth, alkalinity, pH, and nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphate, total phosphorus, dissolved silica) plus phytoplankton chlorophyll a.
- Time span from February 1945 to the end of 2013; some variables begin earlier than others.
- Data are available for download in CSV format.

## Variables and units
- TEMP: surface temperature in degrees Celsius
- OXYG: surface oxygen saturation (% air-saturation)
- SECC: Secchi depth in metres
- ALKA: alkalinity in µg CaCO3 per litre
- PH: pH
- NH4N: ammonium in µg N per litre
- NO3N: nitrate in µg N per litre
- PO4P: soluble reactive phosphate in µg P per litre
- TOTP: total phosphorus in µg P per litre
- SIO2: dissolved reactive silicon in µg per litre
- TOCA: phytoplankton chlorophyll a in µg per litre
- Note: some values flagged if below detection limits (sign_if_LT_LOD)

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Frequency: weekly or fortnightly sampling.
- Initial collection by the Freshwater Biological Association; since 1989 by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and predecessors.
- Sampling site: on a boat at a marked buoy location in the deepest part of the lake.
- Depth integration for water chemistry: 0–5 m (1945–1962), 0–10 m (1962–1964), 0–7 m (1964 onwards).
- Data represent measurements from February 1945 through the end of 2013.

## Data quality and structure
- Data provided are raw and have not been quality controlled or calibrated (except for double entries from 2005 onwards); visual checks have been performed.
- Data structure: CSV with columns including sdate (measurement date), variable descriptions, value, and sign_if_LT_LOD.

## Data accessibility and metadata
- Metadata may be incomplete; researchers may need to contact the dataset originators to verify suitability for specific uses.
- Public sharing of underlying data is part of the dataset’s usage, which can pose barriers for some users or data sources.
- Data may require transformation and cleaning before advanced analysis or synthesis with other datasets.

## Recent uses and publications
- Demonstrates utility in long-term ecological and climate-related research, including:
  - Early warning indicators for non-linear change in long-term ecological data.
  - Long-term perch population and community biology studies.
  - Climate-change-related phytoplankton phenology and lake productivity studies.
  - Broader ecological and hydrological research referencing long-term windermere datasets and related lake and climate dynamics.
