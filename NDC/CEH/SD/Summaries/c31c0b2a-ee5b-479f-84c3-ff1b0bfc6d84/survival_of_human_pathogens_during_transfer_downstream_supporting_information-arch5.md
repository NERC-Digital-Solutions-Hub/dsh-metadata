# What has been recorded and what form does the data take?

- The dataset documents a study on the survival of human pathogens bound to microplastics during transfer through the freshwater–marine continuum.
- Pathogens studied: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
- Materials: polyethylene microplastic beads and glass beads (2 mm diameter) to compare surfaces.
- Experiments:
  - Experiment 1: direct discharge of microplastics from WWTP into freshwater or seawater; 12 L mesocosm tanks with 30 cages per tank; sampling over 27 days.
  - Experiment 2: downstream transport from WWTP effluent through river water, estuary, seawater to beach sand; sequential mesocosm tanks modeled this pathway; biofilm and microbial surface colonization measured.
- Location: University of Stirling, Scotland, UK.
- Timeframe:
  - Mesocosm studies conducted in April and June 2022.
  - Experiment 1 sampling: June 4–6, 2022.
  - Experiment 2 sampling: April 12–16, 2022.
- Data collected include:
  - Water characteristics (pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity, salinity, temperature) for background and during experiments.
  - Bacterial concentrations (CFU) in water and on plastics and glass surfaces.
  - Biofilm formation quantified by crystal violet staining (absorbance at 550 nm) on plastic and glass surfaces.
  - Sand dry weight measurements (for Experiment 2).
- Data completeness and quality:
  - Data checked for anomalies; no missing data reported.
  - Initial bacterial inocula quantified and recorded.
  - Detailed metadata and variable descriptions accompany the data files.
- Data provenance and responsibility:
  - Collected and interpreted by Rebecca Metcalf.
  - Tied to UKRI NERC grants: NE/S005196/1 and NE/V005847/1.
- Data format and documentation:
  - The dataset comprises 14 CSV files, each with specific variable structures and accompanying metadata descriptions (full description available in section 8 of the record).
  - File names include background characteristics, experiment characteristics, initial bacteria added, CFU counts in water and on plastics/glass, crystal violet biofilm measurements, and sand weight (sample file list provided).
