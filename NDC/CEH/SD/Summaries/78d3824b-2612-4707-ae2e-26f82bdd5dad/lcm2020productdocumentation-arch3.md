# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020

- UKCEH LCM2020 is the eighth UK land cover map produced by UK CEH, designed for annual monitoring of land cover/change with 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes derived from Biodiversity Broad Habitats (BAP).
- Product scope covers Great Britain and Northern Ireland with three dataset types for each region, totaling six datasets: 10 m classified pixel datasets, classified land parcel datasets, and 25 m pixel rasterised land parcel datasets.
- Objective: enable informed decisions for environmental monitoring and policy, with emphasis on data production, validation, accuracy, and clear presentation of results.

## Data products and structure

- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets
  - Derived from classification Scenes; each pixel has a most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class (band 1) and an associated probability/confidence (band 2).
  - Not generalised by UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine landscape details (e.g., narrow features); intended for specialist users.
- Land Parcel datasets
  - Generated by intersecting the 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to create parcel attributes.
  - Datasets include parcel-level metadata (e.g., hist, mode, purity, conf, stdev, agg, n) and parcel spatial identifiers.
  - Regional product names and extents align with GB and NI grids (EPSG: 27700 for GB, EPSG: 29903 for NI).
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Rasterised representation with three bands per parcel: dominant land cover (_mode), mean confidence (_conf), and parcel purity (_purity).
- Scope of datasets
  - GB: two grids (Great Britain) with two dataset types for parcels and two pixel resolutions (10 m for classification, 25 m for parcel rasterisation).
  - NI: parallel datasets at 10 m and 25 m resolutions, with NI-specific grid (Irish Grid) and extents.

## Methods and training

- Classification approach
  - Automatic classification using Bootstrap Training combined with Random Forest (RF) classifier.
  - Bootstrap Training automatically selects training observations from historical land maps to train the classifier without fresh field data.
- Seasonal and contextual data
  - Classification Scenes combine Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images (spectral bands across four seasons) with 10 Context Rasters to reduce spectral confusion.
  - Seasonal composites derived from Google Earth Engine; nine Sentinel-2 bands used.
- Training data
  - Bootstrap Training datasets drawn from UKCEH LCM2017, 2018, and 2019; filtered to >99% purity across three years.
  - GB training objects: 941,027; NI training objects: 214,833.
- Classification details
  - 100 km x 100 km GB tiles used to extract 36-band Seasonal Composite Images; 46-band GB Classification Scenes when combined with context rasters.
  - NI uses a single 36-band Seasonal Composite Image combined with NI context rasters to yield a 43-band Scene.
- Software and tools
  - Custom RF classification pipeline integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL (open source).

## Spatial framework and parcel data

- UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Based on LCM2007 framework with minor post-2015 changes to storage and indices; unique parcel identifiers (gid) may not align with LCM2015 for direct parcel-identifier comparisons.
  - Land parcels have a minimum area around 0.5 ha (minimum mappable unit, MMU) and are designed to represent discrete real-world units (fields, parks, urban areas, etc.).
- Purpose of parcel framework
  - Supports data smoothing, reduces classification noise, and enables robust change detection over time through a stable parcel-based reference.

## Validation and accuracy

- Validation approach
  - Validation against GB countryside survey (2019, 2020), open-source National Forest Inventory data, IACS data, and bespoke LCM validation points (total of 34,715 points).
  - Result: overall accuracy of 79.2% (full thematic detail) for LCM2020 (Appendix 4).

## Relationship to biodiversity and BAP

- Classification scheme
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are closely related to UK BAP Broad Habitats but are not identical; BAP definitions reflect field-based botanist detection, not remote sensing.
  - Generalized Land Parcel Aggregate Classes are provided to align with BAP Broad Habitats while preserving remote-sensing compatibility.
- Mapping nuances
  - Some BAP habitats (e.g., Standing water and Canals vs Rivers and Streams) are represented by single UKCEH Land Cover Classes (Freshwater); saltwater vs freshwater distinctions are handled where possible.
  - Appendices provide detailed notes on class definitions, potential spectral confusions, and recommended usage.

## Data access, governance, and openness

- Data governance and transparency
  - Methodology emphasizes data provenance, validation, and the need to share underlying data to enable scrutiny and reuse.
  - The production workflow is described in detail (_bootstrap training_, RF, classification scenes, context rasters, etc.), enabling reproducibility and evaluation by monitoring framework authors.
- Dataset documentation
  - Appendix 5 lists official dataset names for all six LCM2020 datasets (GB NI categories; 10 m classified rasters, land parcel products, 25 m rasterised parcels).
  - Extents, coordinate systems, pixel resolutions, band counts, and product naming conventions are specified.

## Limitations, caveats, and interpretation guidance

- Automation vs manual corrections
  - Annual production relies on automated methods with minimal manual corrections; residual errors are expected to be random in space/time and may flicker across years.
  - Visual inspection is used for final prioritization when overlapping Classification Scenes occur.
- Classification uncertainty and spectra
  - Some classes exhibit higher confusion (e.g., acid grassland, bog, neutral grassland), with per-class accuracy and producer’s accuracy reported in Appendix 4.
  - Saltwater vs Freshwater distinctions can be challenging in tidal/coastal areas; coastal context rasters mitigate but some confusion remains.
- Data granularity and MMU
  - 0.5 ha MMU means many small patches fall below the threshold and are not represented in Land Parcel outputs, though they may appear in the 10 m classified pixel data.
- Compatibility and comparability
  - The LCM2020 series aims to maximize temporal consistency and change detection capability; re-application of new methods across the entire catalogue may occur if accuracy improvements justify it.

- Overall takeaway for monitoring framework authors:
  - LCM2020 provides a rigorous, automatically generated, annually updated land cover product with clear documentation of methods, validation, and class relationships to biodiversity habitat frameworks.
  - It offers both pixel-level (10 m) and parcel-level (10 m to 25 m rasterised) outputs, enabling flexible monitoring designs from fine-grain change detection to parcel-based trend analysis.
  - The combination of Bootstrap Training and RF, alongside rich contextual and seasonal data, supports robust state-and-change monitoring, with quantified per-class accuracy and extensive metadata to inform governance and data management considerations.
