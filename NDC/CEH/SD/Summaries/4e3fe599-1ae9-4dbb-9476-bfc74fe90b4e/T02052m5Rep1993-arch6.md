# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

## Overview
- Final report (August 1993) documenting the Landsat-based Land Cover Map of Great Britain and its integration with Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) field data.
- Led by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE); jointly funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the British National Space Centre (BNSC).
- Purpose: produce a national digital land cover map from satellite imagery, provide a PC-based information system (CIS) for landscape planning, and demonstrate remote sensing applications across diverse users.

## Data and Methods
- Data sources:
  - Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, across eight Landsat paths to cover Britain.
  - Summer and winter scenes used to improve classification of vegetation types.
- Processing workflow:
  - Geometric correction and co-registration to British National Grid with sub-pixel accuracy for summer data; winter data resampled to align with summer data.
  - 46 scenes required; mosaics built from 100 km tiles for full Great Britain coverage.
  - Training and classification:
    - Field reconnaissance used to define training areas for Bayesian maximum likelihood classification.
    - Subclasses defined to capture spectral variability; 25 target cover types defined, later aggregated to 17 key classes for general use and 9 major classes for pattern analysis.
    - Iterative, knowledge-enhanced classification with context-based corrections and rejection thresholds to classify about 98% of pixels.
  - Post-classification processing:
    - Masking for urban/suburban, coastal/intertidal, cloud/shadow, and snow.
    - Local interactive corrections for rare classes.
    - 3x3 kernel filtering to remove isolated misclassified pixels.
  - Output formats:
    - Digital Land Cover Map with ~25 m pixel resolution; effective minimum mappable unit around 0.125 ha; overall data volume ≈ 1 GB.
    - Hard-copy maps and sample outputs illustrating urban London, the Norfolk Broads, the North York Moors, and Ardnamurchan (Scotland).
- Output classifications:
  - 25 target classes, aggregated into 17 key classes (aligned with CS1990 and LCD project outputs) and 9 major classes for pattern analyses.
  - Classifications designed to be hierarchical, enabling simple or detailed aggregations as required.
- Data integration and GIS:
  - Integration with CS1990 field data and the Countryside Information System (CIS) for desktop GIS analyses at 1 km grid resolution and detailed per-pixel outputs at 25 m.

## Classification and Outputs
- Land cover classes:
  - 25 target classes (e.g., Sea/Estuary, Inland Water, Beach/Mudflat/Cliffs, Saltmarsh, Grass Heath, Moorland Grass, Pasture/Meadow/Amenity Grass, Meadow Verge/Semi-natural, Ruderal Weed, Fored Forest (Felled), Open Shrub Heath/Moor, Bracken, Deciduous Wood, Coniferous/Evergreen Woodland, Tilled Land, Urban/Suburban Development, Continuous Urban, Inland Bare Ground, etc.).
  - Aggregated into 17 key classes to facilitate compatibility with field surveys and the LCD framework.
  - 9 major classes used for pattern analysis within the CIS.
- Output products:
  - 2S m resolution raster data (25 m) forming a national land cover map; 1 km summary data within the CIS framework.
  - 1 km summary data per land cover type (700 x 1300 grid), plus 36 pairwise boundary data layers for selected class boundaries.
  - 100 km mosaic tiles for efficient storage and processing; national coverage with an overall accuracy contingent on class type and boundary conditions.
- Output uses:
  - Applications in biodiversity, biogeography, environmental chemistry, land-use planning, and landscape management.
  - Demonstrator GIS projects linking land cover with bird diversity, habitat analysis, road proximity effects, emissions plumes, and river catchment management.

## Integration with Countryside Survey 1990
- CS1990 field survey:
  - Stratified random sample of 1, Ian squares (508 squares) with detailed ground data on land cover, land use, linear and point features, and flora/fauna.
  - Field data digitised in an ArcInfo GIS and linked to an Oracle database; compared against Landsat-derived maps at multiple levels.
- Validation and comparisons:
  - Vector (field) versus raster (Landsat) comparisons across 143 squares; overall direct agreement varied by class and definition.
  - When considering time-based changes and boundary pixels, overall correspondence ranged from about 67% (raw) to 76% (including time changes); within-field agreement reached about 82%.
  - Differences largely reflect definitional interpretations (e.g., bogs, grasses), time lags between field surveys and imagery, and the inherent generalisation in both datasets.
- Ground-truth integration:
  - Recognised that direct per-pixel accuracy comparisons are constrained by differing objectives and classification rules; results provide a basis for inter-comparison and dataset integration rather than absolute error metrics.

## GIS Applications and Demonstrator Projects
- CIS (Countryside Information System):
  - A desktop, Windows-based system that brings together CS1990 field data, Landsat-derived data, and other thematic layers (topography, soils, geology, climate) for region-based analyses.
  - Enables administrative region selection, masks (altitude, geology), and region-specific land cover estimation.
  - Pattern analyses at 1 km resolution to quantify landscape diversity and fragmentation.
- Demonstrator projects and applications:
  - Correlations between land cover patterns and bird species diversity (e.g., BTO studies).
  - Sparrowhawk habitat analysis related to woodland patterns.
  - Radio-tracking overlays to study movements and habitat use of raptors.
  - Road corridor analyses to quantify woodland within designated buffers.
  - Emissions plume impact studies and vegetation sensitivity assessments.
  - River catchment management studies (NEWP, Tyne and Cam) integrating land cover with water quality and wildlife distributions.
  - Key Habitats project demonstrating landscape-scale habitat definition using Landsat data plus external data (soils, rivers, etc.).
- Extent of use:
  - Approximately 40 specific applications identified, with ongoing or planned studies; a broad range of organizations engaged or interested (government, agencies, utilities, consultants).

## Validation and Accuracy
- Overall accuracy:
  - Direct pixel-level correspondences between Landsat classifications and field data range from 46% to 90% depending on class complexity and aggregation.
  - Remove boundary pixels and time-change considerations, and correspondence improves (e.g., about 71% overall; 76% including within-field accuracy).
  - After accounting for definitional differences and time-based changes, uplands and arable patterns show higher agreement than complex pastoral and marginal landscapes.
- Sources of error:
  - Mixed boundary pixels and the 25 m pixel size leading to edge confusion.
  - Geometric misregistrations, while generally minor, can affect pixel-level validation.
  - Differences in ground-truth definitions and the inherently generalised nature of field vs. satellite data.
- Overall takeaway:
  - When harmonising definitions and accounting for time lags, the Landsat-based map achieves substantial correspondence with field data, supporting its use for national-scale analyses and GIS-enabled decision making.

## Applications and Current/Planned Uses
- Broad applications across environmental management, conservation planning, land-use assessment, and policy support.
- Examples of current/planned uses:
  - Key habitats mapping, conservation surveys, and less-favoured area assessments.
  - Moorland landscape management, heathland restoration potential, and biodiversity monitoring.
  - Land-use planning, water quality and hydrological studies, ecological and epidemiological modelling.
  - GIS-driven atlas development, environmental impact assessments, and road/urban development planning.
- Accessibility:
  - The Landsat-based land cover data, along with 1 km summary outputs in CIS, are designed for end-user access and practical application in policy and planning contexts.

## Challenges and Limitations
- Data acquisition issues:
  - Cloud cover reduced usable data; some areas remained unmapped or only partially mapped.
  - Winter data gaps (roughly 12% of Britain) and reliance on multiple scenes increased costs and complexity.
- Spatial and temporal challenges:
  - Summer-winter registration differences and time lags between imagery and field surveys affect pixel-level accuracy.
  - Boundary pixels and mixed classes complicate per-pixel validation.
- Classification and generalisation:
  - The 25-to-17-class reduction imposes an artificial quantisation; not all users will want or be able to operate at the same level of detail.
  - Differences in data collection methodologies between field surveys and satellite classification are expected; results are best interpreted as correspondences rather than exact “truth.”
- Data management:
  - Handling and analysis of high-resolution, national-scale raster data pose storage and processing challenges; vector representations can be prohibitively large (e.g., 80,000 polygons for Britain).
  - The CIS approach provides scalable 1 km summaries, but full spatial detail requires careful data management.

## Future Updates and Conclusions
- Regular updates planned to maintain currency of the Land Cover Map; anticipated that repeat mapping could take two-thirds of the original effort.
- Methodological enhancements:
  - Exploit supplementary data (e.g., radar) to achieve all-weather mapping and fill gaps.
  - Build a spectral signature library for automated classification and potential fully automated mapping of new images.
  - Improve summer–winter registration and investigate edge-detection approaches for better coincidence.
  - Expand cover detail to include more crop types and unimproved grasslands; assess feasibility of higher spectral/spatial resolution data as new sensors emerge.
  - Integrate OS boundary data and further refine boundary pixel handling using mixture modelling.
- Knowledge base and training:
  - Use the existing Land Cover Map as a knowledge base for training areas, segmentation, and quality checks in future mapping efforts.
- Overall impact:
  - The digital Land Cover Map of Great Britain represents a major advance in national-scale, remotely sensed land cover mapping, enabling widespread data access and diverse GIS-enabled analyses and applications, with a pathway for routine updates and methodological improvements.
