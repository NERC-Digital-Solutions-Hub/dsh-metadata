# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECt IN REMOTE SENSING

## SUMMARY
- This is the first digital land cover map of Great Britain since the 1960s, launched in July 1993 by NERC and BNSC.
- It was produced as a British National Space Centre demonstrator project integrated with Countryside 1990 (CS1990) and DoE as a user.
- Land cover was mapped with a supervised maximum likelihood classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper data.
- The database records 25 cover types (sea/inland water, beaches/bare ground, developed/arable land, and 17 semi-natural vegetation types across woodland, shrub, wetland, and grassland).
- Maps are grid-based at 25 m resolution; minimum accurately mappable unit is about 1 ha, with some spectral-signature features detectable down to ~0.125 ha.
- Using summer and winter data improved classification accuracy, notably separating semi-natural vegetation from arable areas and distinguishing deciduous from evergreen vegetation.
- Validation against independent ground data showed 67–90% correspondence depending on detail; overall correspondence around 76% (including time-based changes) and 82% for within-field pixels.
- The Land Cover Map is integrated with CS1990 field data and 1-km GIS outputs via the Countryside Information System (CIS) for landscape planning and management.
- Current applications include studies of species diversity, biogeography, environmental chemistry, land-use planning, and landscape management, with growing end-user interest.
- The project also demonstrated GIS applications and multiple demonstrator projects across a wide range of environmental and planning uses.

## INTRODUCTION
- Final report of a project to compile a national, digital land cover map from satellite images.
- The Land Cover Map of Great Britain (ITE) was launched 12 July 1993 by NERC and BNSC; the CS1990 field survey provides complementary land-use and ecology data for 1990.
- The integration of land cover maps with CS1990 field data and CIS is a major focus; future reports cover LCD (Land Cover Definitions) alignment and broader applications.
- The report reviews methods, results, applications, and plans for future land rover mapping from space.

## BACKGROUND
- Prior to this effort, Britain lacked a complete, digital land cover map; existing European efforts used generalised, less-detailed methods.
- Landsat TM imagery, with a middle-infrared band, was found capable of mapping major cover types in Britain at field-by-field scale.
- Summer-winter data composites improved spectral separation of classes, and field reconnaissance informed training and validation.
- The project aimed to produce a digital map of land cover, assess accuracy, and integrate with CS1990 data and GIS (CIS).

## MAP PRODUCTION
- Landsat TM imagery from eight paths covered Britain; the baseline mapping date was 1990 with allowances for ±2 years due to cloud and data availability.
- Summer and winter images were co-registered to produce composite images; six bands (three from each date) were used to classify.
- Image processing included geometric correction to British National Grid (BNG), sub-pixel registration, and co-registration of summer-winter pairs.
- Target land cover types were defined (25 classes) and then aggregated into 17 key classes; a further simplification to 9 major classes was used for pattern analyses.
- Training areas were developed from extensive field reconnaissance, typically 100–200 pixels per scene, with 5+ training areas per subclass.
- A Bayesian maximum-likelihood classifier was applied to class pixels to assign them to nearest subclass or reject as noise; iterative refinement and context-based corrections were used.
- Post-classification corrections included urban/coastal masking, cloud/shadow/snow masks, and local interactive corrections for rare classes.
- A large mosaic of GB land cover was built from 100 km tiles, joining overlaps by feature similarity and preferred scene quality.
- The final digital Land Cover Map records units down to 2-pixel resolution (~0.125 ha), though most features are accurately mapped at 1–5 ha scale in practice.

## INTEGRATION WITH THE COUNTRYSIDE 1990 FIELD SURVEY
- CS1990 used stratified random sampling of 1-βn grid squares (508 squares) to document land cover, land use, and landscape features, digitised into GIS formats.
- Comparisons were made at three levels: vector field-squares (143 squares; 25 LCD target classes mapped to Landsat), 2S Landsat vs. LCD aggregations (17 keys vs. 59 LCD baseline), and 1 km square comparisons.
- Direct pixel-level agreement between Landsat and field surveys averaged around 46% (before reconciliation of definitions and scales); when comparing with time-based changes and boundary pixels excluded, overall correspondence rose to about 71–76%.
- Moorland fringe mapping and ESA (Environmentally Sensitive Area) comparisons showed higher agreement in some test areas (e.g., 89% for moorland distribution in four 10x10 km areas; ESA comparisons around 78–88% depending on definitions).
- The LCD project (77–83% agreement after accounting for definitions and time changes) highlights that differences often reflect interpretation and methodology rather than outright errors.

## THE COUNTRYSIDE INFORMATION SYSTEM (CIS)
- CIS is a PC-based desktop system combining CS1990 field data, Landsat-derived data, and additional thematic data for landscape planning.
- One-kilometre pattern analyses were implemented to summarize land cover within 1 km squares, including:
  - 17 key cover types (from LCD 25-to-17 aggregation)
  - Edge/boundary pixel metrics per square
  - Pairwise boundary overlaps for 9 major cover types (36 combinations)
- The CIS data totals around 64 MB, organized as 700 x 1300 integer percentage layers per cover type.
- These data enable pattern and fragmentation analyses, and allow mapping of habitats and landscape characteristics through integration with soils, geology, climate, and administrative boundaries.
- CIS supports region-specific analyses and can be used to estimate habitat composition, diversity, and landscape structure for conservation and planning.

## GIS APPLICATIONS AND DEMONSTRATOR PROJECTS
- Demonstrator work used GIS to explore spatial relationships and to transfer raster land cover data into vector formats for polygon analysis.
- Applications included:
  - Bird diversity analyses (e.g., BTO studies linking bird diversity to land cover patterns on a 2 km grid)
  - Sparrowhawk habitat studies (woodland extent and configuration)
  - Tracking movements of radio-tagged birds for habitat use and survival analyses
  - Road corridor analyses to quantify woodland presence within buffers around proposed motorways
  - Industrial plume analyses overlaying Landsat data to assess vegetation sensitivity
  - River catchment studies linking land use to water quality and wildlife distributions
  - The Key Habitats Project, integrating Landsat cover data with external data (soils, rivers) to define landscapes and habitats for conservation
- About 40 specific applications were underway or planned, spanning conservation, hydrology, ecology, land-use planning, and environmental assessments.

## FUTURE UPDATES
- Plans to regularly update the Land Cover Map; repeat surveys could take about two-thirds of the original time.
- Proposed improvements include:
  - Exploiting radar/all-weather data (e.g., SAR) to fill gaps from cloud cover
  - Building a spectral-signature library to support more automated classifications
  - Improving summer–winter image registration to reduce mixed pixels
  - Treating the Land Cover Map as a knowledge base to aid updates, training area selection, and validation of new classifications
  - Integrating Ordnance Survey boundary data to improve boundary delineation and segmentation
  - Increasing detail in land cover classification (e.g., specific crops, unimproved grasslands)
  - Exploring new sensor generations with better spatial and spectral resolution
  - Combining old and new methods to enable routine, automated updates

## CONCLUSIONS
- The project delivered the first national GB land cover map since the 1960s, in digital form, enabling broad accessibility and analysis.
- Mapping covered most of Britain; approximately 12% remained unmapped due to cloud, with some regions requiring multiple scenes for full coverage.
- Field reconnaissance and computer classification provided a robust framework, with iterative knowledge-based corrections to improve results.
- The 25-class system (and its 17-key and 9-major aggregations) offers a balance between detail and reliability, enabling users to choose appropriate levels of classification.
- The Landsat-based approach successfully mapped diverse landscapes—from urban centers to moorlands and woodlands—across varied ecological zones.
- The integration of high-resolution Landsat data with CS1990 field data and CIS enables powerful, scalable environmental analyses and decision support for landscape management.
- Quality assurance indicates a reasonable answer to the challenge of mapping continua into discrete classes; disagreements largely reflect interpretation, boundaries, and time-based changes rather than errors alone.
- The project established a foundation for routine updating, future methodology improvements, and broader applications in environmental planning and conservation.

## FUTURE OUTLOOK (SYNTHESIZED)
- Regular updates of the GB Land Cover Map are feasible and valuable, with ongoing work to improve automation, accuracy, and cloud-gap filling via new data sources (including radar/SAR) and improved image registration.
- The knowledge base approach will facilitate updates, training-data reuse, and cross-validation with field data and OS boundaries.
- Enhanced sensor capabilities and integrated GIS analyses will broaden the utility for policy, planning, and conservation initiatives.
