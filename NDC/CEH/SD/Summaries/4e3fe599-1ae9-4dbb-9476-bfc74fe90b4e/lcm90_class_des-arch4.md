# The Land Cover Map of Great Britain: an automated classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper data

## Overview
- Generated by supervised maximum likelihood classification of Landsat TM imagery (25 m grid) to produce 25 land cover types, including sea, inland water, beaches, bare ground, arable land, and 18 semi-natural vegetation types.
- Combining summer and winter imagery substantially improved accuracy; about 88% of Britain classified from combined dates, 12% from single-date due to cloud or data limitations.
- The document details map classes, resolution, and depiction, with further relations to other surveys described in Wyatt et al. (1994).

## Spatial resolution, registration, and data quality
- Spatial resolution: 25 m grid; minimum accurately mappable unit approximately 1 ha (with features as small as 0.125 ha discernible under some conditions).
- Boundary details: finer patterns (roads, fields, etc.) evident within 2-pixel units (0.125 ha) after removing isolated pixels.
- Registration: Landsat-derived raster maps aligned to 143 vector 1-km field-squares; average displacement about 0.8 pixels (20 m); most squares required little or modest shifts for correspondence.
- Accuracy context: ground-truth validation is challenging due to differing definitions and approaches; overall accuracy realistically around 80–85% when accounting for definition differences and temporal change.
- Error sources: mixed boundary pixels (up to ~40% of pixels near boundaries) contribute most error; misclassification vs. misregistration can be difficult to separate; temporal changes (e.g., pasture ploughed) can affect observed accuracy.

## Land cover classes (25 target types)
- The classification encompasses a wide range of habitats and land uses, including:
  - Sea / estuary (open sea and coastal waters)
  - Inland water (fresh waters and estuarine waters)
  - Beach / mudflat / cliffs (coastal bare ground)
  - Saltmarsh (intertidal vegetated zones)
  - Pasture / meadow / amenity grass
  - Mown / grazed turf
  - Meadow / verge / semi-natural swards
  - Marsh / rough grass
  - Bracken
  - Rough pasture / dune grass / grass moor
  - Grass heath (semi-natural acid grasslands)
  - Moorland grass (upland grasslands)
  - Bog (herbaceous wetlands; lowland and upland variants)
  - Deciduous / mixed wood (scrub/orchard and deciduous woodland)
  - Scrub / orchard
  - Deciduous woodland
  - Coniferous / evergreen woodland
  - Tilled land (arable crops)
  - Suburban / rural development
  - Urban development
  - Inland bare ground
  - Unclassified (areas not fitting the 25 classes)

- Notes on classes:
  - Some classes reflect regional variation and management (e.g., grasslands with varying degrees of improvement or disturbance).
  - Subclasses (e.g., types of arable crops) are aggregated into ecologically meaningful, consistently mappable 25 target classes; there is an option to tailor aggregations in GIS.
  - A simplified 17 “key” class system exists as an alternative to the 25-class system for consistency, with a mapping table linking 17 key types (A–Q) to the 25 target types.

## Classification scheme and data products
- Two hierarchical classifications:
  - 25 target cover-types (standard digital product)
  - 17 key cover-types (aggregation of the 25; provided as standard in the Countryside Information System)
- Data formats and resolutions:
  - 25-class dataset: available at 25 m resolution (each cell labeled 1–25) and as a 1-km summary (per 1-km cell, 25 layers giving percentage cover of each target type).
  - 17-class dataset: available as 1-km summary data; non-standard/custom datasets can be produced (e.g., fewer classes).
- Relationship table:
  - A mapping between 25 target classes and 17 key classes is provided to support cross-walks between the two schemes (A–Q refer to 17-class labels; 1–25 refer to 25-class target labels).

## How to use and interpret the data
- The 25 m and 1 km products offer different levels of detail for national and regional analyses.
  - 25 m data: cell values 0–25 correspond to target classes.
  - 1 km data: each cell contains percentage coverage (0–100) for each target class, e.g., a 1 km cell with 320 of 1600 constituent 25 m cells of class 10 would show 20% in the corresponding layer.
- The 17-class dataset provides a more consistent nationwide option, with the 25-class data still available for maximum detail.
- Users should consider potential regional inconsistencies for rare/poorly represented classes and the possibility of re-aggregating classes in GIS to suit specific applications.
- Temporal context: imagery combines summer and winter dates; differences between surveys (e.g., land use changes) can affect classifications, so interpreting changes over time requires caution.

## Limitations and caveats
- Ground-truth limitations: no universal ground-truth standard; differences in survey methods and definitions impact accuracy estimates.
- Boundary and mixed-pixel effects: many classification errors arise from pixels straddling class boundaries.
- Temporal changes: real land-cover changes between the two dates can reduce apparent accuracy.
- Some rare classes (e.g., ruderal weeds) may be inconsistently mapped regionally due to sample data limitations.
- Unclassified areas: about 2% of Britain remains unclassified in the 25 m data, due to cloud cover, lack of cloud-free imagery, or unusual cover types; represented as 0 in the 25 m dataset and as a residual in 1-km summaries.
