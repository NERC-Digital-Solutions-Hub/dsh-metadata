# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

## Purpose and Significance
- Final report for a national digital land cover map of Great Britain, the first since the 1960s and first to be readily end-user accessible in digital form.
- Launched July 1993 by NERC and BNSC as a demonstrator project within Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990), integrating remote sensing with field survey data for landscape planning and management.

## Data and Methodology
- Data source: Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery; summer and winter composites to improve class separation.
- Coverage and resolution:
  - 46 scenes required for full GB cover; 30 m TM pixels; data organized as 25 m ground cells; minimum accurately mappable unit ~1 ha (with some 0.125 ha potential for strongly spectral features).
  - Eight Landsat paths cover Britain; seasonal windows chosen per local vegetation/climate.
- Preprocessing and correction:
  - Geometric correction and co-registration to British National Grid (BNG); sub-pixel accuracy on average; inter-scene co-registration validated against 143 field squares.
  - Masks for coastal, urban, cloud, snow, and shadow to improve accuracy; local interactive corrections for rare classes; post-classification filtering (3x3 kernel).
- Classification:
  - Supervised Bayesian maximum likelihood classification using training areas from field reconnaissance; ~100–200 training pixels per subclass where possible.
  - Target classifications: 25 target classes, aggregated into 17 key classes for outputs and 9 major classes for pattern analysis.
  - Hierarchical scheme allows aggregation to simpler classes or disaggregation for specialists; context-based corrections employed to improve per-pixel decisions.
- Outputs and data structure:
  - Full GB land cover at 25 m grid; 25-class dataset and 17-key class dataset; 1 km pattern analyses in the Countryside Information System (CIS).
  - Mosaic built from 100 km tiles; outputs include hard-copy maps and GIS-ready raster data; 1 km summary data layers per cover type (700 x 1300 grid of integers representing percent cover per square).

## Integration with Countryside Survey 1990 and CIS
- CS1990 field surveys: stratified random sample (508 1-km squares) with detailed land cover, land use, and landscape features; field data digitised in GIS and linked to Oracle database.
- Data integration:
  - Pixel-by-pixel comparisons between Landsat-derived maps and CS1990 field data; multiple comparison schemes (vector field-squares, 1 km grid, and all squares).
  - Integration within CIS (PC-based desktop system) to provide 1-km summaries and region-based analyses (regions defined by administrative boundaries, altitude, geology, etc.).
  - 1-km CIS outputs include area and boundary measures by cover type, and pairwise boundary data for landscape pattern analyses.

## Validation, Accuracy, and Limitations
- Overall correspondence between Landsat map and CS1990 field data ranges from 67% to 76%, depending on how definitions and time-based changes are treated; higher when boundary pixels are excluded.
- Within-field agreement around 82% (i.e., higher when considering core areas away from boundaries).
- Moorland and upland areas show higher validity (e.g., moorland mapping agreement around 89% across four test areas).
- ESA mapping checks demonstrated around 78–88% agreement when compared to aerial photography-based ESA delineations.
- Main sources of error:
  - Mixed boundary pixels and misregistration near scene joins.
  - Time lags between field campaigns and imagery (rotation agriculture, new forest plantations).
  - Differences in class definitions and generalisation between field surveys and Landsat classifications.
  - Boundary and scale issues (10–25 m pixel size) affecting fine features.
- Validation nuances:
  - Field vs. Landsat comparisons reflect different objectives and generalisation rules; direct pixel-level correspondence is not an absolute measure of accuracy.
  - The project emphasizes the value of integrating field data with generalized Landsat-derived maps to enhance both detail and coverage.

## Applications and Demonstrator Projects
- GIS-based applications and landscape analyses demonstrated within CIS and external projects.
- Examples include:
  - Linking land cover patterns to bird species diversity (e.g., common breeding birds; habitat associations).
  - Sparrowhawk habitat studies in relation to woodland extent.
  - Tracking movements of radio-tagged birds using Land Cover Map as a spatial backdrop.
  - Landscape classification for road planning corridors (buffer analyses around roads).
  - Emission plume and vegetation sensitivity studies near industrial sites.
  - New and ongoing projects under the Key Habitats initiative and other biodiversity and conservation programs.
- Broad user interest: over 200 expressions of interest at launch; ~160 attendees; diverse organisations represented (government, agencies, industry, NGOs, academia).

## Data Availability, Stewardship, and Governance
- Outputs designed for wide access and interoperability; data stored as raster layers suitable for GIS workflows.
- Countryside Information System (CIS) provides accessible 1-km summary data and boundary/pattern metrics for planners and policymakers.
- Appendix 2 lists numerous organisations engaged at launch, indicating broad stakeholder engagement and demand.

## Future Updates and Development
- Plans to update the Land Cover Map regularly; anticipated learning curve reduces update time.
- Key improvements under consideration:
  - Exploit all-weather data (e.g., radar/SAR) to fill gaps from cloud cover.
  - Develop spectral signature libraries to support more automated classifications.
  - Improve summer–winter registration and context-driven corrections to boost per-pixel accuracy.
  - Incorporate higher-resolution sensors and cross-sensor analyses to improve detail.
  - Integrate OS boundary data to enhance boundary accuracy and segmentation.
  - Extend cover detail to include crops and finer grassland distinctions where feasible.
  - Investigate automated, knowledge-based classification updates using the existing map as a training/reference.
- Emphasis on using Landsat-derived land cover as a knowledge base to facilitate routine updates without starting from scratch.

## Conclusions
- The Land Cover Map of Great Britain represents a major national, digital GIS-ready dataset: first digital GB land cover map, generated from Landsat TM data, with extensive field validation and integration with the CS1990 program.
- The project demonstrates a scalable, repeatable methodology for national-scale land cover mapping that spans urban to upland and coastal environments.
- While cloud cover and boundary issues limit complete coverage, the map provides valuable spatial detail (down to 25 m cells, with some finer features detectable) and a robust framework for subsequent landscape analyses and decision support.
- The integrated use of Landsat-derived maps with CS1990 field data in CIS significantly enhances the potential for environmental monitoring, biodiversity studies, land-use planning, and policy evaluation across Britain.
- The approach establishes a practical, expandable knowledge base for ongoing updates and diverse GIS-based environmental applications.
