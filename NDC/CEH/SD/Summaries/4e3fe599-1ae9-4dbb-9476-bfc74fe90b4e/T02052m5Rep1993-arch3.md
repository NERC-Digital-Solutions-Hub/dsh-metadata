# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING THE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECT IN REMOTE SENSING

- The Land Cover Map of Great Britain is the first national land cover map produced from satellite imagery since the 1960s, and the first digital form for end users since the 1930s. It was launched in July 1993 by NERC and the British National Space Centre (BNSC).
- It was created as a demonstrator project within the Countryside 1990 framework, with the Department of the Environment (DoE) as a key user, integrating with the Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) field data.
- Mapping was performed with Landsat Thematic Mapper data using a supervised maximum likelihood classification, resulting in 25 target cover types, which were aggregated into 17 key classes for broader applications, and further into 9 major classes for pattern analysis.
- Output takes the form of 25 m grid-cell maps (minimum accurately mappable unit around 1 ha; some features down to 0.125 ha if spectrally distinctive). The maps are complemented by a PC-based information system (CIS) and linked to field data for site-specific refinement.
- The dataset is available digitally and organized as a national mosaic at 1 km resolution for landscape planning and management; the full GB land cover datafile is about 1 gigabyte.
- Summer and winter acquisitions improved classification accuracy by exploiting phenological differences (e.g., distinguishing semi-natural vegetation from arable land and separating deciduous from evergreen vegetation). A training set was built from field reconnaissance, with typically 100–200 pixels per subclass and about 98% of scene classified.
- Integration with CS1990 field survey data and GIS allows broad-scale analyses (e.g., landscape pattern metrics) and supports a wide range of applications from conservation to environmental chemistry and land-use planning.
- Validation involved comparing Landsat-derived maps with CS1990 field-square data (vector and raster forms). Direct agreement was 46% due to boundary and definition differences; overall correspondence rose to 67% when accounting for these differences, 71% excluding boundary pixels, and up to 76% when time-based changes and within-field differences were considered.
- The Countryside Information System (CIS) provides 1 km summary data (area, boundary length, and pairwise boundaries) for 17 key cover types (and 9 major class boundaries for pairwise analysis), enabling broad regional analyses while preserving computational practicality.
- Applications and demonstrators include pattern analyses relating land cover to bird diversity, habitat assessments, moorland fringe mapping, and environmentally sensitive area (ESA) mapping. Numerous organisations participated in the launch, confirming wide interest and potential utility.
- Future updates emphasize regular re-mapping, improving cloud-free data coverage (including potential use of radar/SAR data for all-weather mapping), expanding spectral signature libraries, improving summer–winter registration, enabling more detailed subclass distinctions, and integrating new sensor data with existing knowledge bases to streamline updates.

- Key outputs and outputs formats
  - 25 target cover-types, aggregated to 17 key classes (and 9 major classes for pattern analysis).
  - 1 km summary data in CIS (700 x 1300 pixel layers per cover type; 64 MB data footprint for the Layered structure).
  - 100 km mosaic tiles of GB land cover data; hard-copy map products and digital raster data ready for GIS use.
  - Validation and comparison outputs (vector and raster intercomparisons; boundary analyses; moorland fringe assessments; ESA comparisons).

- Data, governance, and openness considerations
  - Data are produced in digital form and designed for broad accessibility through CIS and subsequent GIS applications.
  - The project recognizes the need to manage metadata and to ensure data use is coherent with end-user requirements, hints at future automation to speed updates, and emphasizes knowledge-based corrections and post-classification procedures to improve data quality.

- Challenges and limitations
  - Cloud cover and incomplete winter data (around 12% unmapped; some 0.5% unmapped due to persistent cloud).
  - Boundary pixels and mixed pixels create classification challenges; time-lag between field data collection and imaging can induce changes in land cover (e.g., rotations between arable and pasture).
  - Geometric misregistrations between summer and winter scenes can introduce per-pixel validation errors; distinguishing misregistration from misclassification is essential.
  - The 25-class system imposes a level of quantisation that may not capture all ecologically relevant variation; the 17-class aggregation helps with comparability.
  - Handling the full-resolution 80,000 polygons for Britain in GIS analyses is challenging; raster-based approaches mitigate this but may obscure fine-scale detail.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - The Landsat-derived Land Cover Map provides a robust baseline for environmental monitoring and policy evaluation, enabling quantitative landscape metrics (e.g., area proportions, boundary densities, and pairwise boundaries) at national scales.
  - The integration with field surveys and GIS demonstrates how remote sensing can be combined with ground-truth data to inform landscape management and conservation strategies.
  - The approach supports monitoring of land-use change, habitat distribution, and environmental pressures, with potential for routine updating and integration with additional thematic layers (soils, geology, climate).

- Recommendations for future monitoring and data governance
  - Maintain a knowledge-based, hierarchical classification to balance detail and reliability, while enabling user-specific customisations.
  - Expand coverage with all-weather data sources (e.g., radar) to reduce data gaps due to cloud.
  - Improve geometric registration between seasonal images to enhance per-pixel accuracy and reduce boundary-related errors.
  - Continue developing automated or semi-automated classification workflows and extend spectral libraries for rapid reclassification of new imagery.
  - Enhance data sharing and metadata practices to support broader reuse, reproducibility, and governance.

- Conclusions
  - The Land Cover Map of Great Britain represents a major advance in national-scale, digital land-cover mapping and sets a foundation for ongoing, routine updating.
  - The project demonstrates the value of integrating remote sensing with field data within a GIS framework to support a wide range of environmental monitoring and policy applications.
  - While not all questions can be resolved with the initial product, the approach provides a scalable and adaptable knowledge base for future monitoring and decision-support activities.
