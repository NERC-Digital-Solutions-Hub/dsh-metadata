# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

## Aim and scope
- Create a digital land cover map of Great Britain from Landsat TM data, the first since the 1960s and the first fully digital national map.
- Integrate with Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) field data and make outputs available for landscape planning and management.
- Demonstrate remote sensing applications for land cover mapping and support future updates and GIS integration.

## Background
- There had been no comprehensive digital land cover map for Britain since the 1960s; previous maps were incomplete or not digital.
- Landsat TM data, enhanced by summer/winter composites, offered a means to map major cover types at field-by-field scale.
- CS1990 provided a field-based benchmark for land cover, land use, and ecological data to accompany the remote-sensing map.
- The project aimed to combine remote sensing with field data in a GIS context (CIS) to support planning and environmental analyses.

## Methods ( Landsat-based mapping)
- Data and imagery
  - Landsat Thematic Mapper data across eight paths for Britain; used summer and winter images to improve classification of vegetation and land covers.
  - Image handling included geometric correction to the British National Grid and co-registration of summer/winter pairs.
- Classification and training
  - Supervised maximum likelihood classification with numerous subclasses defined from field reconnaissance.
  - Final target: 25 land cover classes, organized hierarchically; 17 key classes recommended for comparability; 9 major classes for pattern analysis.
  - Training areas were built from field reconnaissance routes and in-field observations, with iterative refinement and contextual corrections.
- Pre- and post-classification processing
  - Masking for urban/suburban areas, coastlines, cloud, shadow, and snow to improve accuracy.
  - Local interactive corrections for rare or small classes; 3x3 kernel filtering to remove isolated misclassifications.
  - Building mosaic of full GB cover in 100 km tiles with seam minimization.
- Data outputs and formats
  - 25 target classes mapped to 2S x 2S m grid (25 m resolution); 1 km summary grids with 17 key classes (and 9 major classes for pattern analysis).
  - Data files include a digital Land Cover Map (~1 GB) and hard-copy map outputs; outputs able to support GIS-based analysis and visualization.
  - A PC-based Countryside Information System (CIS) was developed to access 1 km and 25 m data, including 1 km summary and boundary/pattern metrics.

## Integration with Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
- CS1990 used stratified random sampling of 1° National Grid squares to capture ground truth for land cover, land use, and landscape features.
- Data were digitized into a GIS and then compared with Landsat-derived cover data at multiple levels:
  - Vector (field-squares) to raster ( Landsat) comparisons across 143 squares for pixel-level accuracy; aggregated to 25 target cover types.
  - Grid-based comparisons (2S Landsat classes vs LCD 59 baseline classes) for pattern analysis.
  - 1 km-scale comparisons across 508 squares for integration into CIS.
- Results highlighted differences in definitions and mapping objectives between field surveys and Landsat classifications, emphasizing the value of integration rather than viewing discrepancies as errors.

## Validation and accuracy
- Direct pixel-level agreements between Landsat and field surveys ranged from 46% (due to definitional and boundary differences) to higher when broader context and time changes were considered.
- Overall correspondence improved when harmonizing definitions:
  - Approximately 67% overall correspondence after aligning class definitions.
  - Excluding boundary pixels increased correspondence to about 71%; within-field correspondence reached around 82%.
  - When time-based changes (e.g., rotation in agriculture) were considered, overall correspondence rose to about 76%.
- By landscape type, uplands and arable patterns showed higher correspondence; pastoral and marginal landscapes with complex semi-natural patterns showed lower agreement due to spatial generalization and boundary issues.
- Moorland mapping experiments showed high agreement (about 89%) between Landsat-derived moorland maps and field maps in four test areas.

## GIS applications and demonstrator projects
- CIS enabled various landscape analyses by combining Landsat data with field data, soils, geology, climate, and administrative boundaries.
- Demonstrator projects included:
  - Relating land cover patterns to bird species diversity (BTO) using Shannon indices.
  - Analyzing woodland extent and bird movements (sparrowhawks) and radio-tagged prey movements.
  - Assessing woodland proximity to planned roads and emissions plumes and their impact on vegetation.
  - River catchment studies for water quality and wildlife distributions (NEWP).
  - Key Habitats project that integrates Landsat-derived cover data with external GIS data to define landscapes and habitats for conservation planning.
- Approximately 40 specific applications were underway or planned, indicating broad utility across conservation, planning, and environmental monitoring.

## Land cover classification scheme (details for Data Stewards)
- 25 target classes mapped; aggregated to 17 key classes for output and 9 major classes for pattern analyses.
- The 17-class structure is designed to be ecologically meaningful and consistent across Britain; the 25-class list allows detailed differentiation where feasible.
- The dataset includes a knowledge-based, context-aware correction approach to improve per-pixel classifications.
- Appendix descriptions (not reproduced here) provide detailed class definitions and constraints, including minimum mappable units (2 pixels, ~0.125 ha) and regional upland/lowland masks.

## Post-classification processing and data fusion
- Masking procedures to separate and correct urban, coastal, cloud, snow, and shadow effects.
- Mosaicking and joining of scenes to produce seamless national coverage, with attention to edge effects and mixed pixels.
- Post-classification filtering offered, but a balance chosen to preserve landscape detail.

## Limitations, challenges, and governance implications
- Cloud cover caused data gaps; winter data were not available for some areas (12% mapping gap; 0.5% unmapped due to cloud).
- Summer–winter registration imperfections and mixed boundary pixels influence pixel-level accuracy; edge effects were a major source of discrepancy.
- The 25-class quantization imposes artificial boundaries on continuum vegetation types; the hierarchical 25-to-17-to-9 structure supports flexible use and aggregation depending on user needs.
- Handling of large raster/vector datasets posed processing and data-management challenges; full-scale vector representations were impractical at national scale, underscoring the value of raster-based summaries.
- The CIS provides 1 km summaries and boundary metrics to facilitate practical analyses, though it sacrifices some local spatial detail for usability and performance.

## Future updates and recommendations
- Ongoing updates to the Land Cover Map are planned, with the expectation that repeat mapping could be faster (roughly two-thirds of the original time).
- Recommendations include:
  - Exploiting radar data for all-weather coverage to fill cloud gaps.
  - Expanding spectral signature libraries to automate future classifications.
  - Improving summer–winter image registration and exploring edge-detection-based alignment.
  - Maintaining the knowledge base to support updates, re-training, and re-use in new classifications.
  - Exploring combinations of old and new data to accelerate updates.
  - Incorporating boundary data from OS maps for better segmentation and classification.
  - Adding finer land cover detail where feasible, including specific crops and unimproved grasslands.
  - Anticipating advances in sensor technology (higher spatial and spectral resolution) and addressing new methodological challenges.
  - Prioritizing routine, automated updating workflows to keep data current.

## Conclusions
- The Land Cover Map of Great Britain represents a major advance as the first national digital land-cover product in Britain and a powerful data resource for planning, conservation, and environmental research.
- The project successfully integrated Landsat-based land cover mapping with the CS1990 field survey, enhancing both datasets through GIS-enabled analysis.
- A hierarchical, flexible classification (25 target types, 17 key classes, 9 pattern classes) supports a wide range of end-user needs, with known limitations acknowledged and mitigated through masking and contextual corrections.
- The Countryside Information System (CIS) provides accessible, scalable outputs at 1 km and 25 m resolutions, enabling practical landscape analyses and decision support for policy makers, planners, and researchers.
- The combined approach demonstrates substantial application potential across biodiversity, land use planning, environmental monitoring, landscape management, and policy assessment, with clear pathways for future updates and methodological improvements.
