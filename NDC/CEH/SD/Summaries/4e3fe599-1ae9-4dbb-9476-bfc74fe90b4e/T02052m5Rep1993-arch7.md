# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

## Overview
- Final report (August 1993) detailing how a national land cover map of Great Britain was produced from Landsat imagery as a demonstrator project funded by NERC and BNSC.
- Map forms the digital, nationwide counterpart to Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) and is integrated with CS1990 field data for landscape planning and management.
- Aims to produce a digital land cover database, assess accuracy, and integrate map data with other GIS data for end-user applications.

## Data and Classification
- Output: Landsat-based Land Cover Map of Great Britain with 25 target land cover types, consolidated into 17 key classes (and used for 9 major pattern classes for GIS analyses).
- Grid resolutions:
  - Landsat data: 25 m ground cell size; minimum accurately mappable unit ~1 ha (spectrally detectable smaller features down to ~0.125 ha for strong signatures).
  - Integrated output data stored as a datsfile of ~1 gigabyte; full GB map is composed of 100 km tiles.
  - Countryside Information System (CIS): 1 km resolution summaries derived from the 25-class data (converted to the 17 key classes for pattern analysis).
- Classification approach:
  - Supervised maximum likelihood classification using summer-winter Landsat TM data, with six-band output (bands 3, 4, 5 from both summer and winter scenes).
  - Training areas developed from extensive field reconnaissance; typically 5+ training areas per subclass, 100–200 pixels per subclass when feasible.
  - Iterative, knowledge-based corrections with context (not solely pixel-based), including:
    - Urban/suburban masking to correct arable misclassifications near towns.
    - Coastal and maritime masking to separate land from sea/estuary features.
    - Cloud/shadow/snow masks; manual and automated patching where needed.
    - Local interactive corrections for rare, small classes.
    - Post-classification 3x3 kernel filter to remove isolated misclassified pixels.
- Data integration and mosaicking:
  - Summer-winter composite images used wherever possible; some scenes rely on single-date images due to cloud.
  - Data co-registered to British National Grid (BNG) with sub-pixel accuracy; average registration displacement ~0.8 pixels (20 m).
  - GB-wide mosaic built from 100 km tiles, with seams minimized using overlaps and feature alignment.
- Output formats:
  - 25-target-class raster data (2S x 2S m grid).
  - 17-key-class summaries (1 km CIS outputs).
  - 9 major-class pattern outputs for GIS analyses.
  - Hard-copy map outputs (films and prints) and on-screen display.

## Integration with Countryside Information System (CIS) and CS1990
- CS1990 field survey:
  - Stratifed random sample of 1x1 km squares; detailed field data on land cover, land use, linear and point features, and flora/fauna.
  - Field data digitized into GIS (ArcInfo) and linked to Oracle for attribute data.
- Validation and comparisons:
  - Vector field maps converted to raster for pixel-by-pixel validation against Landsat map for 143 squares; additional comparisons at 1 km and 2S-class levels.
  - Direct pixel agreements between Landsat and field surveys range around 46% due to definitional differences; after aligning definitions, overall correspondence ~67%; excluding boundary pixels, ~71%; when considering time-change (rotation farming and land-use change), correspondence rises to ~76% with within-field agreement ~82%.
  - Moorland fringe mapping experiment showed ~89% agreement between Landsat-based moorland distribution and field maps in four test areas.
- Implications for GIS work:
  - Landsat-derived land cover provides a consistent, scalable base layer for regional to national analyses; differences in definitions and time lags between field and imagery data are intrinsic and must be accounted for in analyses.
  - The CIS summary data (1 km) and the 25-class Landsat map can be used together for landscape pattern analyses, habitat assessment, and planning support.

## GIS Applications and Demonstrator Projects
- Demonstrator area: Thames estuary (75 km x 50 km) converted to GIS, enabling analysis of land parcels, areas, and boundaries; scalability shown with ~80,000 polygons in the test area.
- Applications demonstrated include:
  - Relationship between land cover patterns and bird species diversity (e.g., Shannon Diversity Index against Landsat-derived cover diversity).
  - Sparrowhawk habitat analyses in Cambridgeshire using woodland patch size and distribution from the Landsat map.
  - Tracking movements of radio-tagged birds against land cover to study habitat use, duration, and occupancy.
  - Region-of-interest analyses around roads using buffer zones to assess woodland distribution within proximity to infrastructure.
  - Emission plume modeling over Landsat-based land cover to assess vegetation sensitivity.
  - NEWP project (river catchment management) exploring land use, water quality, and wildlife distributions using Landsat data.
  - Key Habitats project illustrating big-data GIS integration with Landsat cover types, soil and hydrology data to map landscapes and habitats for conservation planning.
- Broad outcome: around 40 current or planned applications, spanning biodiversity, landscape management, water quality, conservation, and environmental impact assessment.

## Accuracy, Limitations, and Recommendations
- Accuracy range:
  - Direct correspondence between Landsat and field data: 46%; overall correspondence after accounting for definitions and boundaries: 67–71%; higher when considering time-based changes (up to ~76% overall and ~82% within-field).
  - Regionally, upland and arable landscapes show higher correspondence than pastoral/mixed patterns due to complex semi-natural vegetation mosaics.
- Sources of error:
  - Mixed boundary pixels and misregistration near scene joins; cloud, shadow, and snow masking challenges; time lag between field surveys and imagery; differences in how field and Landsat data define habitats (e.g., bog vs. dwarf shrub in wet vs. dry conditions).
  - Spatial resolution constraints: 25 m pixels may oversimplify fine-scale variation; 2S m mappers provide finer detail but are computationally intensive for nationwide scales.
- Comparisons with other data:
  - LCD (Land Cover Definitions) project suggested 59 baseline classes; Landsat’s 25 target classes were designed to be ecologically meaningful and mappable with acceptable accuracy.
  - Integration with field data adds value through cross-validation and enhanced landscape interpretation.
- Practical guidance for GIS use:
  - Use 17 key classes for broad, consistent analyses; preserve 25 target classes for detailed studies when accuracy allows.
  - Treat boundaries and time-change cautiously; employ CIS 1 km pattern metrics for regional pattern analysis and landscape-scale modeling.
  - Knowledge-based corrections and contextual rules significantly improve per-pixel classification reliability.

## Future Updates and Developments
- Regular updates planned; the learning curve suggests updates could be accomplished in two-thirds of the original mapping time.
- Planned improvements include:
  - Exploiting radar data (all-weather) to supplement cloud-covered areas.
  - Building a spectral-signature library for more automated classifications and spectral-temporal analyses.
  - Improved summer-winter registration, and exploring edge detection to tighten co-registration.
  - Refined training areas and potential expansion of class detail where feasible.
  - Integration of other data sources (OS boundary data) to improve boundary alignment and segmentation.
  - Higher-resolution sensors and multi-spectral data to enhance detail; developing methods to combine old and new data for faster updating.
  - Routine updating strategies to maintain a current and robust land cover knowledge base for GIS analyses.

## Conclusions
- The Land Cover Map of Great Britain represents the first national, digital land-cover product since the 1960s, enabling nationwide GIS-based analyses and applications.
- The mapping demonstrates that a semi-automated Landsat TM classification can cover Britain from sea level to uplands, including urban, agricultural, semi-natural, and coastal habitats.
- The integration of field survey data with the Landsat map in the CIS provides a powerful toolkit for landscape planning, resource management, conservation, and environmental assessment.
- While the data achieve substantial utility, limitations due to cloud, time lags, boundary pixels, and class definitional differences are acknowledged; ongoing updates and methodological refinements are planned to enhance speed, accuracy, and detail.
- The knowledge base created by this project lays the groundwork for further automated mapping, GIS-based analyses, and wide-ranging applications across government, academia, and industry.
