# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 MAPPING TIlE LAND COVER OF GREAT BRITAIN USING LANDSAT IMAGERY: A DEMONSTRATOR PROJECr IN REMOTE SENSING

## Executive snapshot for Data Leaders
- first national digital land-cover map of Great Britain since the 1960s; launched July 1993 by NERC and BNSC
- digital raster map produced from Landsat TM data; integrated with Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
- 25 target land-cover classes, aggregated to 17 key classes, and further to 9 major classes for pattern analysis
- maps are grid-cell data at 25 m resolution; a minimum mappable unit is about 1 hectare (0.125 ha patterns detectable in strong signatures)
- data system built around PC-based Countryside Information System (CIS) at 1 km resolution for landscape planning
- extensive validation against CS1990 field data; demonstrated broad utility across biodiversity, landscape management, environmental chemistry, land-use planning
- ongoing and planned demonstrations show broad multi-agency interest and potential for routine updates and automation

## Data assets and structure
- Landsat TM imagery: 30 m pixels, 7 bands; summer and winter images used to improve classification
- output formats:
  - Land Cover Map: 25 target classes, aggregated to 17 key classes (and 9 major classes for certain analyses)
  - 1 km summary data derived from 1 km grid cells, aligned with 1 km CIS outputs
  - 100 km mosaic tiling approach for assembling full Britain maps
  - digital data (~1 GB) plus hard-copy map outputs
- spatial structure:
  - 25 m pixel resolution; full GB mapped to 100 km tiles for mosaic assembly
  - 1 km summary data layers; 17 cover-types (key classes) at 1 km resolution
  - unclassified areas ~ up to 2% due to cloud or atypical classes
- metadata and standards:
  - classification hierarchical: 25 target classes mapped to 17 key classes; 59 LCD field classes referenced for cross-project comparability
  - field reference data from CS1990 used for training and validation; cross-checks with independent sources (e.g., MAFF ESA studies)

## Methods and data workflow
- image processing workflow:
  - geometric correction and co-registration of summer and winter Landsat scenes to British National Grid
  - creation of summer–winter composite images; six-band data used (bands 3, 4, 5 from each date)
  - training areas identified from field reconnaissance; 70–80 subclasses typical per scene
  - supervised maximum likelihood classification with iterative refinement (training areas, subclass adjustments, reclassification)
  - contextual knowledge-based corrections, mosaicking into full GB coverage, and post-classification adjustments
- masking and corrections:
  - urban/suburban masking to fix misclassification near built-up areas
  - coastal/maritime masking to separate terrestrial from coastal/intertidal features
  - cloud and snow masks; patching with single-date classifications where needed
  - local interactive corrections for rare or small classes (tile-based edits)
  - post-classification filtering primarily to remove isolated misclassified pixels
- integration with field data:
  - CS1990 field survey: stratified random sample of 1,Ian squares (508 squares) with detailed land cover, land use, linear features, species data
  - vector field maps converted to raster for pixel-by-pixel comparisons; multiple comparison schemes at 1 km and 2S-class levels
  - vector-to-raster and mosaic-level comparisons used to assess overall accuracy and to relate Landsat-derived cover to LCD field classes

## Outputs and dissemination
- Land Cover Map outputs:
  - 25 target classes, collapsed to 17 key classes; 9 major classes used for certain pattern analyses
  - outputs available as raster data at 25 m resolution and summarized to 1 km for CIS
  - 100 km tiles produced for mosaic assembly; hard-copy outputs include filmwriter/thermal wax prints
- Countryside Information System (CIS):
  - PC-based desktop system integrating Landsat data with CS1990 field data and other thematic datasets
  - 1 km pattern analyses: area by cover type, boundary pixels, and pairwise boundary overlaps
  - CIS provides GIS-enabled access for regional analyses, administrative boundaries, soils, geology, climate, etc.
- applications demonstrated:
  - biodiversity studies (e.g., bird diversity in relation to land-cover diversity)
  - habitat mapping (e.g., key habitats for conservation)
  - landscape pattern analyses; integration with external data for regional planning and impact assessments
- outputs used by a wide range of organizations; launch attracted over 200 attendees; ongoing inquiries and collaborations

## Validation, accuracy, and limitations
- validation approach:
  - comparison against CS1990 field data across 3 levels: vector field-squares, 2S Landsat vs LCD aggregations, and 1 km square analyses
  - direct pixel-level agreements vary (roughly 46% direct agreement; 67% when accounting for definitions; 76% excluding boundary pixels; up to ~81% when allowing time-based changes)
  - moorland fringe mapping tested in four areas with 89% agreement between Landsat and field maps
- key limitations and sources of error:
  - mixed boundary (edge) pixels and spectral/temporal variability leading to misclassification
  - time-lag effects between field survey (1990) and Landsat imagery (1988–1992 window)
  - differences in definitions and generalizations between field surveys and Landsat classifications
  - geometric misregistrations between summer and winter scenes; some residual misalignment does not heavily affect broad area statistics
  - cloud cover reduced usable area; about 12% of Britain not covered by winter data; some areas unmapped due to cloud or lack of cloud-free scenes
  - distinction between continuous spectra and discrete classes imposes quantization; regional differences in grassland classification reflect ecological variability and management practices
- comparisons with other data sources (ESA, API):
  - independent validation against API-based ESA mappings showed varying degrees of agreement; differences largely due to method and data type (photo-interpretation vs spectral classification)

## Integration with GIS and demonstrator projects
- GIS-based demonstrations and analyses:
  - Thames estuary test area used to explore raster-to-vector transitions and polygon-based analyses
  - large-area data handling challenges highlighted; performance scales with polygon count
  - pattern analysis and region-of-interest approaches demonstrated; potential for integrating Landsat data with soils, topography, rivers, geologies
- representative applications and projects:
  - Key Habitats project combining Land Cover Map with external data to define landscapes and habitats for conservation planning
  - Bird ecology studies (e.g., sparrowhawks and woodland habitat) using 2 km grid summaries; validation against bird survey data
  - new emissions-plume and water-quality related analyses integrating Landsat land cover with GIS-based models
  - New Environmental and social research collaborations (e.g., NEWP for river catchments)
- current and planned outputs:
  - broad catalog of current/planned uses; about 40 specific applications and ongoing studies
  - a bibliography and list of organizations involved at launch to guide future collaborations

## Challenges and considerations for data leaders
- data availability and coverage:
  - cloud cover and limited winter data constrain complete nationwide coverage; exploration of radar/all-weather data suggested for future updates
- data standards and interoperability:
  - LCD framework provides 25 target classes aligned with field surveys and LCD definitions; 17 key classes offer consistent outputs across surveys
  - knowledge-based corrections and contextual processing improve per-pixel accuracy beyond pure spectral classification
- data quality and usability:
  - substantial value in creating a knowledge base for routine updates; masks and corrections enable reuse in different contexts
  - need for careful interpretation of boundary pixels and time-based changes when using multi-temporal data
- governance, updates, and scalability:
  - plan for regular updates to the Land Cover Map; updates could be performed with reduced effort after initial development
  - emphasis on automation, supplementary data sources (radar, radar-plus-spectral), and sharing methodologies for broader adoption
  - aim to balance detail (subclasses) with consistency (key classes) to meet diverse user needs

## Future updates and roadmap
- proposed enhancements:
  - all-weather data integration (e.g., SAR) to fill winter/cloud gaps
  - automated classification improvements using spectral signatures library and refined training areas
  - improved summer–winter registration to reduce mixed pixels and increase per-pixel accuracy
  - leveraging the Land Cover Map as a knowledge base for future mapping, including training areas, mask definitions, and segmentation
  - exploring higher-spatial-resolution sensors and multi-spectral capabilities for added detail (e.g., crops, unimproved grasses)
  - combining Landsat with OS boundary data to improve boundary delineation and segmentation
- updating strategy:
  - recognize that the Land Cover Map serves as a dynamic knowledge base; updates could reuse existing masks, classification rules, and training data
  - potential to extend 1 km CIS pattern analyses to regional scales with enhanced data inputs
