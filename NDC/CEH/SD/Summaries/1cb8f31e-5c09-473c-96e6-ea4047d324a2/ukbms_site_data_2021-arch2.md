# The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose: Provide annual, standardized data on butterfly population status to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Organised by: Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee; volunteers contribute data.
- Scope: UK-wide, ongoing since 1976; routine monitoring across multiple site-based sampling methods.

## Nature of data collected

- Sampling framework components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) across ~2000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (~800 squares per year).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
- Data types: counts of all butterfly species along transects and targeted surveys.
- Data integration: counts from all methods combined to derive site and species abundance indices.

## Trend analysis and data processing

- Abundance indices: relative measures of population size, not absolute counts.
- Index construction: Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) methodology (2016) with site-year weighting based on flight-period coverage to emphasize observed data.
- Seasonal pattern: uses all counts in a season to model distribution and extrapolate gaps, with weights favoring observed data.

## Quality control

- Data capture: field forms, online entry (UKBMS data site) or Transect Walker software.
- Automated and manual validation: automatic checks for entry errors and out-of-range records, regional transect coordinators review data, ongoing validation through the season.
- Error handling: queries and discussions with coordinators; edits made to the UKBMS dataset as needed.
- Distribution and site management: each site has a regional coordinator with in-depth site knowledge.

## Details of this data download

- Content: location and attribute data for UK butterfly monitoring sites (1976–2020); excludes sensitive sites.
- Format: CSV file with columns including site number, site name, grid reference, easting/northing, transect length, country, number of sections, years surveyed, first/last year surveyed, and survey type (UKBMS or WCBS).

## Licence and attribution

- Licence: Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use and reuse.
- Citation requirements: include the dataset DOI in references; attribution statement required with derived data: “Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data ©…”
- Historical data note: since 2017 data submitters agreed to OGL terms; some historic data IP restrictions may apply, and submitters can be contacted if issues arise.

## Collaboration and contact details

- Opportunities: UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset use and interpretation; opportunities for co-authorship and input in publications, conferences, or posters.

## Key challenges for analysts

- Increasing the value of monitoring datasets by integrating.ukbms data with other relevant data sources rather than using datasets in isolation.
- Enhancing access to underlying data used to create outputs, supporting broader scrutiny and reuse.
