# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview and purpose
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - It relies on volunteer contributions and provides annual data on butterfly population status to address policy questions related to biodiversity status and trends.
  - In operation since 1976, the scheme monitors changes across the UK with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.

- Monitoring framework and data streams
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m width, recording all butterflies weekly from April to September (up to 26 counts/year), across about 2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (plus encouraged spring visits), sampling ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg and larval web counts) focused on specific species.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Data are aggregated into abundance indices (relative population size) rather than absolute counts.
  - Site indices contribute to species-level indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting to reflect the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year at each site.
  - The method uses all counts to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

- Quality control and data governance
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker; automated checks flag potential errors.
  - Regional transect coordinators validate records; ongoing automated and manual validation checks (e.g., distribution range, flight period, first-time records, unusual abundances) are applied.
  - Data corrections are implemented through targeted queries and coordination with coordinators or recorders; data governance and data management standards are applied.
