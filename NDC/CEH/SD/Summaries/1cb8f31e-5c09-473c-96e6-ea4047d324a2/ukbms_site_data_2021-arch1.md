# UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme data download

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with thanks to volunteers.
- Established in 1976, UKBMS monitors butterfly population status across the UK using a large network of sites (over 2500 active sites annually) and multiple sampling methods.
- Sampling frameworks:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects, 2–4 km long, recording all butterflies in a 5 m wide band weekly from April to September (up to 26 counts/year).
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits per year, focusing on common habitats like farmland.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species.
- Data use: vital for understanding changes in butterfly populations and informing biodiversity status and trend policy questions.

- Nature of data collected and trend analysis:
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Indices reflect a constant proportion of individuals observed; some species are more detectable than others.
  - Seasonal indices are produced with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), weighting data by the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site to balance observed vs. extrapolated data.
  - All counts from Pollard walks, WCBS, and reduced surveys contribute to seasonal patterns and final species indices.

- Quality control:
  - Field data collected on standard forms, then entered online using the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
  - Automated checks flag potential data issues (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; continuous checks throughout the season.
  - Additional automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range distributions, atypical abundances, or first-time site records; edits applied to the main dataset as needed.
