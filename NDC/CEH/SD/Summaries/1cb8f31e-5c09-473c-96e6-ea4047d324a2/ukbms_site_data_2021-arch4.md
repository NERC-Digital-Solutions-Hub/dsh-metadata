# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and backbone
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Aims to provide annual data on butterfly population status across the UK to understand changes in insect populations and inform biodiversity policy.
  - Since 1976, monitoring spans over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year, integrating data from multiple sampling methods for a cohesive national picture.

- Data collection methods
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km) walked weekly (ideally 26 counts/year) across habitat sections; nearly 2,000 sites sampled annually.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year, sampling around 800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts using methods tailored to specific species or survey goals.

- Data types and analysis
  - Data are used to produce abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts.
  - Whole-species indices are created using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with site- and year-weighting to reflect the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
  - All counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS contribute to seasonal patterns and index estimates, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, then entered online (UKBMS site or Transect Walker software) and uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods); regional coordinators perform ongoing validation.
  - Further automated/manual validation checks address distribution range, flight period alignment, first-time site records, and atypical abundances; corrections are applied through targeted data edits.

- Details of the data download (UKBMS site data)
  - The download includes location and attribute data for UK butterfly monitoring sites from 1976–2020; sensitive sites are excluded.
  - Data provided as a CSV file with columns such as: Site number, Site name, Gridreference (and Easting/Northing), Length of transect, Country, No. Sections, No. Yrs surveyed, First year surveyed, Last year surveyed, and Survey type (UKBMS or WCBS).

- Licence and attribution
  - Data are provided under the Open Government Licence (OGL), enabling free use with few conditions.
  - Users must cite the data with the associated DOI and include an attribution statement: "Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC."
  - Since 2017, submitters have agreed to data reuse under OGL; some historic data may have third-party IP restrictions.

- Collaboration and contact details
  - UKBMS partners offer advisory support on dataset interpretation and can contribute co-authorship or intellectual input for publications, conferences, or posters arising from UKBMS data.
