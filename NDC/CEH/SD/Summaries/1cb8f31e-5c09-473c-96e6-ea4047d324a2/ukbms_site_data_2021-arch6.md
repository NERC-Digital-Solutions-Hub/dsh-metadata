# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with ongoing volunteer support.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status from a nationwide, site-based monitoring program to understand changes in insect populations and inform biodiversity policy.
- History and scope: monitoring since 1976 with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year; data from all sampling methods are analyzed together.

## Nature of data collected

- Sampling frameworks:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 26 counts per year, weekly during the flight period.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, 2–3 visits per year, surveys in farmland and common habitats.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts, and other methods focused on particular species.
- Data product: abundance indices (relative population measures) rather than absolute counts; indices incorporate counts across sites and surveys to reflect seasonal population patterns.
- Index calculation: Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (since 2016) with weighting to emphasize observed data relative to extrapolated data; accounts for gaps in recording.

## Quality control

- Field data capture: collected on standard forms; entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks: flag unusual counts, data-entry errors, and records outside known flight periods or distributions.
- Regional validation: site data reviewed by regional coordinators; continuous checks during the season.
- Automated and manual validation: cross-checks against known distributions, flight periods, and site-specific norms; discrepancies addressed through queries and edits to the dataset.
