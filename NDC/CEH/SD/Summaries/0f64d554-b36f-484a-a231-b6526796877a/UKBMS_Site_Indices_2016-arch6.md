- Data description
  - UKBMS collects data from over 2,000 sites per year across the UK.
  - Primary method: fixed linear transect counts along Pollard walks, recording all butterfly species within a 5 m wide belt.
  - Across sites, data sources include:
    - All-species transects (majority of sites, 2–4 km transects, weekly counts April–September; ~26 counts/year).
    - Reduced-effort Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS) transects initiated in 2009 for farmland and wider habitats.
    - Single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts on select occasions.
  - WCBS provides 2–4 visits per site (versus 26 for full transects) and is not used for site indices.
- Data collection methods
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; entered via UKBMS MyData or Transect Walker software.
  - Data are uploaded to an Oracle database; regional transect coordinators compile data for their regions.
  - Data collection windows and weather constraints ensure butterfly activity (specific times, wind, temperature, sunlight conditions).
  - Site indices are calculated only for sites with sufficient monitoring; for timed/egg/larval counts, counts are aligned to peak flight period and adjusted for time of year and habitat area.
  - Missing values for transects are handled using a General Additive Model (GAM) to impute and compute site indices.
- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Site indices are relative measures of population size, not absolute counts.
  - They are proportional indicators that correlate with more intensive methods (e.g., mark-release-recapture) and vary by species visibility.
  - Indices reflect the proportion of butterflies observed relative to expected abundance, not exact population figures.
- Quality control
  - In-field automatic checks (Transect Walker) flag unusually high counts or records outside flight periods.
  - Regional coordinators review data; continuous validation during the season.
  - Automated and manual validation procedures check for: records outside known distribution, atypical flight periods, first-time site records, extreme or unusual counts.
- Format and structure of stored data
  - Site indices are stored as CSV files with columns:
    - Species (scientific name per Fauna Europaea), Common name, Year, SiteNo, Site Index.
  - Value -2 indicates insufficient data to calculate an accurate site index for a given species/site/year.
  - Data are originally captured in field, entered online, and stored in an Oracle database.
- Reference information and context
  - Key methodological sources include Pollard & Yates (1993) on transect-based monitoring, Rothery & Roy (2001) on GAM-based imputation for butterfly data, and Emmet & Heath (1990) for nomenclature.
  - Data coverage and methods emphasize standardized transects, fixed routes, and long-term comparability to assess trends.
