# Macroinvertebrate leaf decomposers of Welsh upland rivers in response to organic matter addition

## Aim
- Assess how adding organic matter (leaf litter) affects macroinvertebrate leaf-decomposer communities in Welsh upland streams using a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design.
- Provide standardized environmental monitoring data across multiple streams to evaluate ecological health and potential policy implications.

## Study design
- Before-after-control-impact (BACI) design with upstream reference (control) and downstream experimental (treatment) zones within each stream.
- Eight streams, with similar habitat structure, slope, flow, substratum, and land use in reference and experimental zones.
- Independence between zones maintained by a 20–50 m separation.
- Chronology:
  - Before period (T1): 61–65 days from early Nov 2012 to early Jan 2013; no manipulation; both zones treated equally.
  - After period (T2): 57–62 days from early Jan to March 2013; experimental zone receives leaf litter additions.
- Leaf litter addition modeled using one-tonne bags containing mixed deciduous leaves (oak, birch, alder) proportioned to experimental zone area; maintained minimum wet weight of 1.7 kg m^-2 in experimental zones.
- Additional leaf litter (630 kg wet weight) added to each stream after two large storm events (12 Feb 2013 and 5 Mar 2013).

## Experimental treatment and colonisation framework
- Nylon mesh bags (10 x 15 cm) with apertures:
  - Fine mesh: 500 µm (restricts invertebrate colonisation)
  - Coarse mesh: 5 mm (allows colonisation)
- Bags filled with five grams (±0.05 g) air-dried leaves.
- 48 replicate mesh litter bags per stream: 24 reference, 24 experimental; 24 fine and 24 coarse per zone.
- Bags secured to poles, covered with cobbles to promote natural colonisation; submerged under low-flow conditions.

## Collection, processing, and taxonomic resolution
- Sampling schedule:
  - End of before period (T1): half the bags (6 fine + 6 coarse per zone) removed; 6 new bags of each mesh size added to each pole for after-period measurement (T2).
  - End of after period (T2): remaining bags from T0 and bags added at T2 collected; bags labeled accordingly (e.g., T1-A, T2, T18).
- Preservation and processing:
  - Bags preserved on-site in 70% ethanol; transported to laboratory.
  - Leaf material rinsed (250 µm sieve) and air-dried; macroinvertebrates separated and identified to species where possible; some taxa (e.g., Chironomidae, Tipulidae, Limoniidae, Pediciidae, Oligochaeta, Limnephilidae) identified to coarser taxonomic levels.
  - Field equipment includes a microscope for laboratory identification.

## Data structure and recorded values
- Bag data (core dataset) with 10 columns:
  - site_code, region, date, time (Before/After), landuse, reach (Experimental or Control), Replicate (A-F), BagMesh (leaf bag type), taxon_name (species-level when possible; otherwise genus/family/coarse), abundance.
- Supporting site data:
  - DURESS_CU_site_description.csv containing site_metadata such as site_code, name, Eastings, Northings, Grid, Latitude, Longitude, Elevation, Survey, Catchment.

## Quality control and instrumentation
- Quality Control: None documented.
- Field/instrumentation: Standard field collection with mesh bags and poles; laboratory identification aided by a microscope.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring and data sharing
- Provides a structured, multi-site dataset on the decomposition process and macroinvertebrate colonisation in response to organic matter input.
- Data are prepared for storage and sharing via appropriate portals; emphasis on standardised collection and clear metadata supports environmental health assessments over time.
- Highlights data governance considerations for monitoring programs, including data accessibility and potential data integration with other environmental datasets.

## Supporting documents
- Site description file (Duress_CU_site_description.csv) with geospatial and catchment information for each site.
