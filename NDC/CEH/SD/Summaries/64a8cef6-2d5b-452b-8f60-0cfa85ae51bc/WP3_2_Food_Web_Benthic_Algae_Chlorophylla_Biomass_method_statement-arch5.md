# WP3.2_Food_Web_Benthic_Algae_Chlorophylla_Biomass

- What has been recorded and what form does the data take
  - Chlorophyll-a content and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of biofilm on benthic substrate.
  - Data are presented as means with standard deviations, from up to 10 replicate samples per site per occasion.

- Where were the data collected
  - Benthic biofilm samples collected at three chalkstream sites in the Wessex chalk area: Nine Mile River, River Till, and River Wylye.
  - Sites vary in catchment land-use intensity to reflect landscape gradients.

- When were the data collected
  - Wylye and Nine Mile River: seven occasions.
  - Till: five occasions.
  - Time period: October 2012 to October 2013.

- How were the data collected
  - At each site on each occasion: 10 flat stones from the stream bed within a 100 m survey reach.
  - A 25 x 25 mm area of the stone surface scrubbed; dislodged material collected, including debris from toothbrush bristles.
  - Each stone’s content decanted into a separately labeled 200 ml bottle and frozen.
  - In the lab: samples defrosted, made up to 300 ml with algae-free water, split into two aliquots.
    - Aliquot 1: chlorophyll-a measured spectrophotometrically after acetone extraction.
    - Aliquot 2: AFDM quantified by filtration, drying, weighing, and incineration.
  - Filters dried at 80°C for ≥24 h, weighed, incinerated at 560°C for 8–12 h, reweighed.

- Why were the data collected
  - To construct quantified food webs detailing mass and nutrient flux within the riverine ecosystem.
  - Standing stocks of autotrophic resources (biofilm) were monitored as part of this work.

- Who was responsible for data collection and interpretation
  - Queen Mary University of London River Communities Group, led by Dr J. Iwan Jones, responsible for sample collection, processing, analysis, interpretation, and data management.

- Completeness
  - Nine Mile River and River Wylye: samples collected on seven occasions.
  - River Till: samples collected on five occasions.
  - Exclusions: sampling not conducted during the salmonid breeding season (Dec–Mar) to avoid disturbing redds.
  - Note: two replicate chlorophyll-a samples from Nine Mile River in March 2013 were not processed.

- How was data quality checked
  - Standard laboratory procedures used for chlorophyll-a (Vernon 1960; Lorenzen 1967).
  - No formal QA procedure (e.g., repeat analysis of replicates) described; final values screened for outliers (none found) before calculations.
