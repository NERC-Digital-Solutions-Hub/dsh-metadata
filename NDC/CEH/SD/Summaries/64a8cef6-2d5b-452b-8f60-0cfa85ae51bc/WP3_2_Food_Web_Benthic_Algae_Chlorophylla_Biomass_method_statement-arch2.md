# WP3.2_Food_Web_Benthic_Algae_Chlorophylla_Biomass

## What was recorded and data format
- Chlorophyll-a content and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of benthic biofilm on substrate.
- Data from up to 10 replicate samples per site per occasion, presented as means with standard deviations.
- Data columns include site and location identifiers, sample dates, and summary statistics for chlorophyll-a and AFDM.

## Where the data were collected
- Three chalkstream sites in the Wessex chalk area: Nine Mile River, River Till, and River Wylye.
- Sites chosen to reflect a gradient of landscape integrity and invertebrate diversity.

## When the data were collected
- Wylye and Nine Mile River: seven sampling occasions.
- River Till: five sampling occasions.
- Timeframe: October 2012 to October 2013.
- Completeness caveats: Till not sampled during Dec–Mar salmonid breeding season; two replicate chlorophyll-a samples from Nine Mile River in March 2013 not processed.

## How the data were collected
- Field: at each site/occasion, 10 flat stones were collected from a 100 m survey reach; a 25 x 25 mm area of the stone surface was scraped; dislodged material collected in trays, including material caught in toothbrush bristles; contents decanted into clearly labeled 200 ml bottles and frozen.

## How the data were processed in the lab
- Samples were defrosted and split into two aliquots:
  - Aliquot 1: chlorophyll-a content measured after extraction in 90% cold acetone for 24 h and spectrophotometric analysis (references Vernon 1960; Lorenzen 1967).
  - Aliquot 2: AFDM measured by filtering onto preweighed Whatman GFC filters, drying at 80°C for ≥24 h, weighing, then incinerating at 560°C for 8–12 h and reweighing.
- Filtration used Whatman GFC filters; mass measurements done with an Ohaus balance (to the nearest 0.0001 g).
- Two aliquots per sample were used for the two analyses.

## Why the data were collected
- To construct quantified food webs detailing fluxes of mass and nutrients between nodes.
- To monitor standing stocks of autotrophic resources via stone scrapes as part of assessing ecosystem structure.

## Who collected and who interpreted the data
- Queen Mary University of London River Communities Group, led by Dr J. Iwan Jones.
- Responsibilities included sample collection, processing, analysis, interpretation, and data management.

## Data completeness and quality assurance
- Sampling: 7 occasions for Nine Mile River and Wylye; 5 for Till.
- Quality control: standard laboratory procedures applied (Vernon 1960; Lorenzen 1967); no formal QA procedure such as replicate re-analysis; final values checked for outliers (none found).
- Data management: data were collected, processed, interpreted, and managed by QMUL; note on site exclusions during breeding season and unprocessed replicates as above.

  - RIVER_ID, SITE_ID, RIVER_NAME, SITE_NAME, NGR, EASTING, NORTHING
