# WP3.2_Food_Web_Benthic_Algae_Chlorophylla_Biomass

- What has been recorded and data form
  - Measurements of biofilm autotrophic resources: chlorophyll-a content and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) on benthic substrates.
  - Data presented as means with standard deviations, based on up to 10 replicate samples per site per occasion.

- Where collected
  - Three chalkstream sites in the Wessex chalk area: Nine Mile River, River Till, and River Wylye.
  - Sites chosen to reflect a gradient of landscape integrity and invertebrate diversity.

- When collected
  - Sampling occurred across 7 occasions for Wylye and Nine Mile River; 5 occasions for the Till.
  - Timeframe: October 2012 to October 2013.
  - Note: Till data excluded salmonid breeding season (Dec–Mar) to avoid disturbance; two replicate chlorophyll-a samples from Nine Mile River in March 2013 were not processed.

- How collected
  - At each site and occasion: collect 10 flat stones from the 100 m survey reach.
  - Scrape a 25 x 25 mm area of the stone surface, collect dislodged material; combine from each stone into separate labeled 200 ml bottles and freeze.
  - In the lab: defrost and dilute to 300 ml with algae-free water; split into two aliquots.
    - Aliquot 1: chlorophyll-a via filtration and extraction in 90% cold acetone (24 h) and spectrophotometric analysis.
    - Aliquot 2: AFDM via filtration on preweighed filters, drying at 80°C for at least 24 h, weighing, then incineration at 560°C for 8–12 h and reweighing.

- Why collected
  - To construct quantified food webs detailing mass and nutrient fluxes between nodes.
  - To monitor standing stocks of autotrophic resources via stone scrapes.

- Who was responsible
  - Queen Mary University of London River Communities Group, led by Dr J. Iwan Jones, responsible for collection, processing, analysis, interpretation, and data management.

- Completeness
  - 7 sampling occasions for Nine Mile River and Wylye; 5 for Till.
  - Excluded Dec–Mar for Till due to salmonid redds; two chlorophyll-a replicate samples from Nine Mile River in March 2013 not processed.

- Data quality and checks
  - Measurements followed standard procedures for chlorophyll-a (Vernon 1960; Lorenzen 1967).
  - No formal QA procedure (e.g., repeat analyses) reported; final values checked for marked outliers (none found) before calculations.
