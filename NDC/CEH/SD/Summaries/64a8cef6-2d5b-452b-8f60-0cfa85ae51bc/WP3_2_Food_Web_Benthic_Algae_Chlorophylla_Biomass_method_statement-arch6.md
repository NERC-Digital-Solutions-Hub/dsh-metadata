# WP3.2_Food_Web_Benthic_Algae_Chlorophylla_Biomass

## What was recorded and data form
- Chlorophyll-a content and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of benthic biofilm on stone surfaces.
- Up to 10 replicate samples per site per occasion; data presented as means with standard deviation.
- Columns include mean and standard deviation for chlorophyll-a (mg m-2) and AFDM (mg m-2), plus counts of samples.

## Where data were collected
- Three chalkstream sites in the Wessex chalk area: Nine Mile River, River Till, and Wylye.
- Sites chosen to reflect a gradient of landscape integrity and river invertebrate diversity.

## When data were collected
- Oct 2012 to Oct 2013.
- Wylye and Nine Mile River: seven occasions; River Till: five occasions.
  
## How data were collected (field and lab methods)
- Field: at each site-occasion, collect 10 flat stones from the stream bed within a 100 m survey reach; scrub 25 × 25 mm area on each stone surface to dislodge biofilm; rinse into labeled 200 ml bottles and freeze.
- Lab: defrost and bring to 300 ml with algae-free water; split into two aliquots:
  - Aliquot 1: filter; extract chlorophyll-a with 90% cold acetone for 24 h; measure spectrophotometrically.
  - Aliquot 2: filter, dry at 80°C ≥24 h, weigh for AFDM; incinerate at 560°C ≥8 h and reweigh.
- Purpose: support quantified food webs and monitor autotrophic resource standing stocks.

## Data management, quality assurance, and limitations
- Lead: Queen Mary University of London River Communities Group (Dr J. Iwan Jones).
- Quality control: standard laboratory procedures referenced (Lorenzen 1967; Vernon 1960); no formal QA with replicate re-analysis; final values checked for outliers (none found).
- Completeness issues: one site (Till) sampled fewer times; Dec–Mar avoided to prevent disturbance to salmonid redds; 2 replicate chlorophyll-a samples from Nine Mile River (March 2013) not processed.

## Data schema (key metadata and variables)
- Table columns include:
  - River_ID, SITE_ID, RIVER_NAME, SITE_NAME, NGR, EASTING, NORTHING, SAMPLE_DATE
  - Mean_Chla_mgperm2, StdDev_Chla_mgperm2, Chla_n
  - Mean_AFDM_mgperm2, Std_Dev_AFDM_mgperm2, AFDM_n

## Responsible party
- Data collection and interpretation conducted by QMUL River Communities Group, led by Dr J. Iwan Jones.
