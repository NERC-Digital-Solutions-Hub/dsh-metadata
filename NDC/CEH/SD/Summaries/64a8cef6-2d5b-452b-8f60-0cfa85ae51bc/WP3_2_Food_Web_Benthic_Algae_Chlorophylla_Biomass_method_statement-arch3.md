# WP3.2_Food_Web_Benthic_Algae_Chlorophylla_Biomass

## Overview
- Dataset character: chlorophyll-a content and ash-free dry mass (AFDM) of benthic biofilm on stream substrates.
- Measurement form: up to 10 replicate samples per site per occasion; data presented as means with standard deviation.

## What, Where, and When
- Data collected at three chalkstream sites in the Wessex chalk area: Nine Mile River, River Till, River Wylye.
- Sampling occasions: Wylye and Nine Mile River on seven occasions; Till on five occasions; period October 2012 – October 2013.

## How the Data were Collected
- Field collection:
  - At each site and occasion, collect 10 flat stones from the 100 m survey reach.
  - Scrub a 25 × 25 mm area of each stone surface; gather dislodged material into a tray.
  - Rinse bristles into the tray; transfer contents to clearly labeled 200 ml bottles and freeze.
- Laboratory processing:
  - Thaw and reconstitute samples to 300 ml with algae-free water; split into two aliquots.
  - Aliquot 1: determine chlorophyll-a after acetone extraction (90%) for 24 h; spectrophotometric analysis.
  - Aliquot 2: determine AFDM by filtration on preweighed filters, drying (80°C, ≥24 h), weighing, then incineration (560°C, 8–12 h) and re-weighing.
- Data presentation: chlorophyll-a and AFDM expressed per unit stream bed area; filters and processing follow standard protocols.

## Why the Data Were Collected
- To construct quantified food webs detailing fluxes of mass and nutrients between nodes.
- To monitor standing stocks of autotrophic resources (biofilm) across sites with different landscape integrity.

## Who Collected and Interpreted
- Data collection, processing, and interpretation managed by Queen Mary University of London River Communities Group, led by Dr J. Iwan Jones.

## Completeness and Gaps
- Sampling completed on 7 occasions (Wylye and Nine Mile); 5 occasions for Till.
- Gaps: no sampling Dec–Mar to avoid disturbing salmonid redds; two replicate chlorophyll-a samples from Nine Mile River in March 2013 were not processed.

## Data Quality and QA
- Methods follow established laboratory procedures for chlorophyll-a (Lorenzen 1967) and AFDM (Vernon 1960).
- No formal QA procedure implemented (no replicate re-analysis); final values checked for outliers (none detected).

## Data Structure and Metadata
- Data form: means with standard deviations for the measured metrics.
- Key columns and definitions include:
  - RIVER_ID, SITE_ID, RIVER_NAME, SITE_NAME, NGR, EASTING, NORTHING
  - SAMPLE_DATE
  - Mean_Chla_mgperm2, StdDev_Chla_mgperm2, Chla_n
  - Mean_AFDM_mgperm2, Std_Dev AFDM_mgperm2, AFDM_n

## Data Governance and Sharing
- Outputs are prepared for dissemination (reports, charts, dashboards) and underlying data intended to be shared appropriately.
- Metadata and data accessibility considerations highlighted; data standards and provenance are anchored in documented methods.
