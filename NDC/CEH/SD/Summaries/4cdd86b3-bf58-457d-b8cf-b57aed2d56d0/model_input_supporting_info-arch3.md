# Supporting information for NE/W002930/1: Digital elevation models of bed rock and land surface topography, river discharge data, and settings files for the CAESAR-Lisflood model following the Chamoli ice-debris flow, India, February 2021

- Purpose: Provide input files for CAESAR-Lisflood (CL), a coupled hydrodynamic-landscape evolution model, used to evaluate the geomorphological response of Chamoli River channels to the 7 February 2021 ice-rock avalanche and debris flow.
- Scope: Includes 10 m digital elevation models (DEMs) of bedrock and surface topography, river discharge data, and configuration/settings files for CL runs.

## What are the data
- CL input files necessary to run the model: bedrock DEM, surface DEM, domain-specific hydro inputs, and domain XML configuration files.
- DEMs are down-sampled from 2 m to 10 m for computational efficiency.
- Hydrological inputs derived from GEOGloWS reanalysis data (daily mean discharge) for specified river locations.
- DoD (difference of DEMs) outputs used for assessing topographic change over time.

## Why were the data collected
- To support coupled hydrodynamic-landscape evolution modelling within project NE/W002930/1.
- To evaluate geomorphological response of river channels to the Chamoli disaster and to calibrate the CL model accordingly.

## Where were the data collected
- Region described by a bounding box in WGS 84 / UTM Zone 44N.
- Domains cover connections around key confluences: Ronti Gad–Rishiganga, Rishiganga–Dhauliganga, and downstream of Tapovan Vishnugad HEP.

## When were the data collected
- Data created during the project period (approximately 1 June 2021 to 31 May 2022), including refinements during model calibration.
- Final dataset corresponds to the calibrated model run.

## How were the data collected
- XML configuration files generated by the CL executable and exported on project saves.
- DEMs created in QGIS 3.18 from higher-resolution sources, down-sampled to 10 m.
- Hydro inputs derived from GEOGloWS reanalysis data, retrieved publicly.
- River discharge locations include multiple stream IDs corresponding to major confluences and sites.
- The dataset excludes the CL executable (hosted separately) but provides all inputs to reproduce runs.

## Who was responsible
- Project Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Investigators collected and interpreted the data; outputs from CL are interpreted but not provided within this resource.

## Completeness of the dataset
- Contains all input files required to run CL and reproduce results.
- The CL executable is not included; available from SourceForge with a comprehensive wiki.

## Model overview
- CL combines CAESAR landscape evolution with LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamics to simulate events over long timescales and multiple grain sizes.
- Supports full flood events, erosion/deposition, sediment transport across nine grain sizes, and slope failure processes.

## Model setup
- Run in reach mode, split into four coupled sub-models (domains) with coupling points between specific geomorphological segments.
- Key inputs:
  - DEMs for bedrock (pre-event) and surface (post-event) topography.
  - Input discharge time-series for each domain.
  - Grain size information and various numerical, hydrological, and sedimentological parameters.
- Specific choices:
  - September 2015 DEM for bedrock; 10 February 2021 DEM for post-event topography.
  - Valley-floor sediment fill assumed post-event.
  - Avoided traditional spin-up; wetting of the valley floor with a short 4-day low-discharge period to maintain numerical stability.
  - GEOGloWS hydrological inputs begin on 10 February 2021.
  - Nine grain-size fractions (0.0001–1 m) with domain-specific proportions; calibration adjusted sub-model 2 to be finer.
  - No external sediment flux input for the first year post-event (assessed as negligible relative to new debris-flow deposits).

- Key parameters (final optimized values) include:
  - Grain sizes, sediment transport laws, erode limits, active layer thickness, lateral erosion, slope thresholds, Courant number, Manning’s n, among others.
  - Sub-model differences documented and adjusted during calibration.

## Model calibration
- Calibrated against DEM-difference (DoD) derived volumetric changes for 10 February 2021 to 25 December 2021.
- Domain-scale performance: 86.3% of observed volumetric change reproduced (modelled -6.35 Mm3 vs observed -7.35 Mm3).
- Independent validation with satellite DoD (10 Feb 2021 – 27 Jan 2022): 91.3% match (-6.38 Mm3 modelled vs -6.98 Mm3 from DoD).
- Excluded domains 1 and 2 due to substantial post-event mass deposition from avalanching (not captured by the CL framework for short-lived inputs).

## Output data
- Outputs provided to support monitoring and assessment:
  - Daily mean discharge (Qw) at the exit of each sub-model.
  - Daily sediment yields by size (Qs), both bulk and size-specific.
  - DoD maps produced every seven model days showing vertical topographic change since model start.

## Collection / generation / transformation methods
- As described in sections 1.5 and 2 (input generation, domain setup, and parameterization).

## Nature and units of recorded values
- XML files: text-based configuration for model runs.
- DEM files: gridded elevations in metres.
- Hydro input/output files: river discharge in cubic metres per second (daily).
- DoD outputs: net elevation change per grid cell (metres), with negative values indicating erosion and positive values indicating deposition.

## Quality control
- DoD gaps reflect holes in input DEMs due to photogrammetry issues; these propagate into DoD.
- Statistical significance threshold for DoD changes estimated using 16 stable hillside areas with two-sigma uncertainty per period:
  - DoD uncertainties: ±1.11 m (Sept 2015–10 Feb 2021), ±0.91 m (10 Feb 2021–06 Jun 2021), ±0.61 m (06 Jun 2021–25 Dec 2021), ±1.14 m (10 Feb 2021–25 Dec 2021), ±1.06 m (10 Feb 2021–27 Jan 2022).
