# Supporting information for NE/W002930/1: Digital elevation models of bed rock and land surface topography, river discharge data, and settings files for the CAESAR-Lisflood model following the Chamoli ice-debris flow, India, February 2021

## What these data are
- Input files for CAESAR-Lisflood (CL), a numerical hydrodynamic-landscape evolution model.
- Contain 10 m digital elevation models (DEMs) of bed rock and land surface topography, river discharge data, and configuration/settings files for CL modelling.

## Why the data were collected
- To support coupled hydrodynamic-landscape evolution modelling under project NE/W002930/1.
- Used CL outputs to evaluate geomorphological response of river channels affected by the February 7, 2021 Chamoli ice-rock avalanche and debris flow in Chamoli District, Uttarakhand, India.

## Where the data cover
- Spatial extent described by a bounding box in WGS 84 / UTM Zone 44.
  - Top left: 352312 m E, 3385209 m N
  - Lower right: 384787 m E, 3358896 m N

## When the data were collected
- Data generated 1 June 2021 to 31 May 2022, including refinements during model calibration.
- Final dataset corresponds to the calibrated CL model.

## How the data were collected
- XML configuration file (domain settings) created within the CL executable and exported when the project is saved.
- DEMs (.txt) created in QGIS 3.18, down-sampled from 2 m to 10 m for computational efficiency.
- River discharge inputs ('hydro' .txt) derived from GEOGloWS reanalysis data.
- Hydrological inputs cover four locations: Rontigad, Ronti Gad–Rishiganga confluence, Rishiganga–Dhauliganga confluence, Dhauliganga–Alaknanda confluence.
- Project PI and one Co-Investigator prepared/interpreted the data; outputs from CL are not included, as they can be generated by users with CL and the provided inputs.

## Who was responsible
- Project Principal Investigator (PI) created the data with support from a Co-I.
- The PI and Co-Is interpreted CL outputs; interpretation not part of the data resource itself.

## Completeness and accessibility
- Dataset includes all input files needed to run CL and reproduce results.
- The CL executable is not included; available from SourceForge (CAESAR-Lisflood) with a comprehensive wiki.
- The DoD (Difference of DEM) and other outputs are described but not provided as part of this resource; users can generate outputs with CL.

## Model overview
- CL combines CAESAR landscape evolution with LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamics to simulate events over long timescales.
- Can simulate a broad range of flows, erosion/deposition for multiple grain sizes, sediment transport, and slope failures.

## Model setup for this study
- Model run in reach mode, divided into four coupled domains (domain_1 to domain_4) with coupling points between key geomorphological segments.
- Key inputs: DEMs (bedrock pre-event; surface post-event), discharge time-series, grain size information, and numerous control parameters.
- DEM choices: Sept 2015 bedrock DEM and Feb 10, 2021 surface DEM, with the assumption that the valley floor was sediment-filled after the Feb 2021 event.
- No traditional spin-up period used; a brief 4-day wetting of the valley floor (Feb 6–9, 2021) to ensure numerical stability; hydrology inputs begin Feb 10, 2021.
- Grain-size distribution: nine fractions (0.0001–1 m) applied broadly; calibration adjusted sub-domain 2 to be finer.
- No pre-disturbance sediment flux input was added; external sediment flux considered negligible in the first year post-event.

## Model calibration and validation
- Calibrated by matching domain-scale net volume change against DEM differencing for Feb 10, 2021 to Dec 25, 2021.
- Optimised CL model reproduced 86.3% of domain-scale volumetric change (-6.35 Mm3 modelled vs -7.35 Mm3 observed).
- Independent validation with satellite DEMs (Feb 10, 2021 to Jan 27, 2022) reproduced 91.3% of observed change (-6.38 Mm3 modelled vs -6.98 Mm3 DoD).
- Domains 1 and 2 excluded from calibration/validation due to substantial post-event deposition from avalanches; DoD and timing of these avalanches could not be reflected in the model.

## Output data and intended use
- Outputs of interest: daily mean discharge at hydrological exits of sub-models, daily bulk- and size-specific sediment yields, and DoDs every seven model days.
- Dataset structure and files are arranged to facilitate these outputs and allow reproduction.

## Data quality, uncertainty, and notes
- DoD uncertainties were quantified using stable hillside areas to establish statistically significant change thresholds.
- DoDs have period-specific uncertainties (ranging roughly 0.6–1.14 m) and are used to assess significance of changes.
- Data gaps in input DEMs are propagated into DoDs; photogrammetric limitations (cloud cover, occlusions) explain some gaps.

## Dataset structure (organization and contents)
- Domain-based folders with corresponding files:
  - domain_1: chamoli_domain1.xml, domain1_bedr_DEM.txt, domain1_surf_DEM.txt, rontigad_hydro_input.txt, domain1_hydro_output.dat, etc.
  - domain_2: domain2_* files and outputs
  - domain_3: domain3_* files and outputs
  - domain_4: chamoli_domain4.xml, domain4_bedr_DEM.txt, domain4_surf_DEM.txt, alaknanda_hydro_input.txt, domain3_hydro_output.dat
- File types:
  - XML: CL configuration and model settings
  - DEM TXT: gridded bedrock and surface elevation data (metres)
  - Hydro TXT/Dat: river discharge time-series (daily) and domain-upstream outputs used as inputs to downstream domains
- Outputs are designed to be generated by CL; the provided datasets enable running the model in various orders or in sequence as described.

## Usage notes and caveats
- Users can run the models in any order using the provided hydro data, but typically run in sequence starting with domain_1 to recreate downstream inputs.
- Reproducibility requires obtaining the CL executable externally and consulting the comprehensive wiki for parameter specifics.
- DoD and output data interpretation rely on the provided thresholds and calibration context; exclusion of domains 1 and 2 should be considered when interpreting results.
