# BUTTERFLIES

## Aim and Rationale
- Monitor butterfly abundance using transect methods from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, with a background of approximately 15 years of data for comparison (ECN data) and links to climate relationships.
- The scheme is established and documented, enabling consistent long-term monitoring and interpretation of changes in distribution and phenology.

## Location and Transect Design
- A fixed transect route is established at each site to be representative of the ECN site, often following existing paths or boundaries and covering different management regimes.
- Transect length: typically 1–2 km, walkable in 30–90 minutes; divided into up to 15 sections with distinct habitat/management characteristics.
- Route and section lengths, habitat types, and abundant plants (especially butterfly food plants) are recorded to aid interpretation.
- Management operations near the transect are noted to understand potential impacts.

## Data Recording Protocol
- Recording occurs weekly from 1 April to 29 September, usually 10:45–15:45 BST; recording can proceed in most conditions if temperature is at least 13–17°C (depending on location) and not raining.
- The transect is walked at a steady pace; observers count butterflies flying within or passing through a 5 m × 5 m × 5 m box in front of the observer, by species, for each section.
- Start time, temperature, percent sunshine, and wind speed are recorded at the end of each transect; sunshine is recorded section-by-section during progress.
- At peak season, multiple recorders may be used to improve coverage.

## Time Commitment and Effort
- Each transect takes approximately 0.5–1.5 hours; the monitoring period spans 26 weeks each year.

## Data Structure and Core Variables
- Core identifiers required for every dataset entry:
  - Site Identification Code (unique ECN site code)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., for butterflies)
  - Location Code (replicate sampling locations per core measurement)
  - Sampling Date/time (with time element as needed)
- Weekly transect records include:
  - Start time, Temperature at end of recording, Percentage sunshine, Wind speed (Beaufort scale)
- For each transect section:
  - Transect section number, Species code, Species name, Number seen, Habitat description (numeric code 1–15), BMS code, Common name, Count
- Data precision fields are defined in the data specification (e.g., precision for certain measurements).

## Data Standards, Formats, and Documentation
- Data transfer and dataset formats are specified in accompanying ECN data transfer documentation, available on the restricted access Site Managers' extranet.
- ECNCCU contact for access: ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.
- Standardized coding follows the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS) conventions.
- Habitat descriptions should be qualitative (a short description of habitat types and the most abundant plant species) to aid interpretation, not a full quantitative plant census.

## Recording Forms and Metadata
- A standard BMS recording form is used, available from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS) via the Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood.
- Notes emphasize consistent coding and the use of BMS habitats descriptions to ensure comparability.
- Habitat/plant descriptors should highlight key butterfly food plants and nectar sources to assist interpretation.

## Notes on Data and Interpretation
- The aim is to provide a usable, comparable dataset across years and sites, enabling analysis of abundance, phenology, and potential climate relationships.
- The protocol supports long-term data integration and cross-site comparisons with the national BMS framework.

## References and Background
- Foundational guidelines and previous analyses are cited (e.g., Hall 1981; Pollard et al. 1986, 1988, 1991; Thomas 1991) to justify methodology and its relevance for interpreting butterfly responses to vegetation and climate.

## Data Stewardship Implications
- Ensure data conform to the BMS coding system and ECN dataset specifications for interoperability and long-term storage.
- Maintain fixed transect routes and consistent section delineations to preserve comparability over time.
- Manage access through restricted channels (ECNCCU extranet) and provide metadata alongside datasets.
- Coordinate with data creators/sharers to maintain data quality (accurate site/section codes, species codes, and habitat descriptions) and timely data transfer.
