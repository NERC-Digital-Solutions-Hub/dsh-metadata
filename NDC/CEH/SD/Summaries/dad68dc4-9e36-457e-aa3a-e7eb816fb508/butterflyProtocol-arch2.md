# IB Protocol

## Aim and Rationale
- Monitor the abundance of butterflies using the transect methods of the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS).
- Butterflies respond rapidly to vegetation changes; the ECN protocol uses the longstanding national scheme for robust historical context (~15 years of data) to enable trend analysis and climate relationships (e.g., changes in distribution and phenology).

## Location and Transect Design
- Fixed transect route per site following Hall (1981), representative of the ECN site, and often along existing paths or boundaries.
- Transect length typically 1–2 km, divided into up to 15 sections (sampling strata) to capture habitat/management variation.
- Route marked if needed to ensure consistency; recording includes habitat types and abundant plants (esp. butterfly food plants); notes on nearby management.

## Timeframe and Sampling Frequency
- Recording weekly between 1 April and 29 September.
- Time window: 10:45–15:45 BST (temperature/conditions adjusted if needed); northern/up hillside sites may use a 15°C upper limit.
- Multiple recorders may be used to improve coverage during peak activity.

## Sampling Method and Data Collected
- Transect walked at even pace; butterflies seen flying within or passing through an imaginary 5 m (width) × 5 m (height) × 5 m (in front) box are recorded by species for each section.
- Start time and end-of-transect temperature; percentage sunshine and wind speed recorded (sunshine noted section-by-section).
- Typical session duration: 0.5–1.5 hours per transect; conducted for approximately 26 weeks each year.

## Data Structure and Core Variables
- Core identifiers required for each ECN Site: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code (e.g., butterflies), Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
- Weekly transect variables: start time, end-of-recording temperature, percentage sunshine, wind speed.
- For each transect section: transect section number; species code/name; number seen; habitat description (numeric code 1–15); BMS code; and associated recording precision where applicable.

## Recording Forms and Standards
- Use the standard BMS recording form (available from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood).
- Coding should follow BMS conventions; habitat descriptions should align with the BMS handbook. Include brief notes on plant species (especially nectar sources and butterfly food plants) to aid interpretation without aiming for exhaustive plant abundance data.

## Data Transfer, Access and Documentation
- Data submitted to ECNCCU; refer to accompanying Data Transfer documentation for ECN dataset formats.
- For access to documentation, contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.

## Notes on Analysis, Use and Interpretation
- The standardized data facilitate cross-site comparisons and long-term monitoring to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Historical analyses have linked butterfly population metrics to climate variables and habitat characteristics, supporting interpretation of trends and management effects.
