# IB Protocol

- Aim
  - Monitor the abundance of butterflies using the transect methods of the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS).
  - Leverage butterflies as indicators of vegetation changes and climate responses; use ~15 years of prior data for context and comparison (background work by ITE and JNCC).

- Rationale
  - Builds on the established national Butterfly Monitoring Scheme to provide a strong evidence base for ECN activities.
  - Enables interpretation of results against long-term trends and climate relationships documented in previous studies.

- Method
  - Location and transect design
    - A fixed transect route is established at each site to be representative of the ECN site and may follow existing paths or boundaries; if needed, route is marked to ensure consistency across visits.
    - Transect length typically 1–2 km and can be walked in 30–90 minutes.
    - The transect is divided into up to 15 sections (sampling strata) with notes on habitat type and abundant butterfly food plants; changes in habitat or management nearby are recorded.
  - Recording protocol
    - Weekly recording occurs from 1 April to 29 September.
    - Recording window: 10:45 to 15:45 BST; temperature constraint: 13–17°C if sunshine is at least 60%; if temperature exceeds 17°C, recording can proceed in any weather condition provided it is not raining; at northern upland sites the upper limit is 15°C.
    - Transects are walked at a steady pace; butterflies seen flying within or passing through an imaginary 5 m (width) × 5 m (height) × 5 m (front) box are recorded by species for each section.
    - Start time is recorded; at the end of each transect, temperature, percentage sunshine, and wind speed are recorded (wind noted on a 24-h clock; units in BST; precision notes may apply).
    - Where possible, more than one recorder is used to handle peak activity periods.
  - Data collection and forms
    - Recording uses standard Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS) forms, available via the Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood.
    - Data to ECNCCU follow ECN dataset formats and related Data Transfer documentation; access to documentation is via restricted extranet (Site Managers’ extranet). For access, contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.
  - Core data standards
    - Four key identifying fields must appear in all datasets:
      - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
      - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
      - Location Code (e.g., 01)
      - Sampling Date/Time (including time when data are recorded)
    - For each transect, additional fields include: recording date, start time, end-time temperature, percentage sunshine, wind speed (with precision notes).
    - For each transect section: species code, species name, number seen, habitat description (coded 1–15), BMS code, common name, and BMS method.
  - Data validation and formatting
    - The data specification adheres to the BMS coding and habitat description standards; the growth of dataset compatibility with existing ECN data structures is emphasized.
  
- Time
  - 0.5–1.5 hours per transect, depending on transect length.
  - Conducted weekly for 26 weeks each year (April 1 to September 29).

- Location details
  - Transects are fixed per site to ensure representativeness; routes may follow existing paths, boundaries, and areas under different management regimes.
  - Documentation and habitat notes accompany each transect to aid interpretation (habitat descriptions and lists of common nectar sources or butterfly food plants).
