# IB Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor the abundance of butterflies using transect methods of the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS).
- Leverages about 15 years of prior sampling for comparability with ECN data.
- Builds on evidence that butterfly populations relate to climate and vegetation conditions.

## Rationale
- Uses the established national Butterfly Monitoring Scheme protocol (ITE and JNCC) to provide a robust background dataset.
- Ensures consistency and comparability with existing long-term data for trend and phenology analyses.

## Method (Transect design and recording)
- Fixed transect route at each site, selected to be representative of the ECN site and cover different management regimes.
- Route length 1–2 km, walkable in 30–90 minutes; may be split into up to 15 sections (strata) with distinct habitat/management.
- Transect marked to ensure identical route across visits; recording information tied to each section.
- Recording occurs weekly from 1 April to 29 September, typically 10:45–15:45 BST; temperature thresholds apply, weather conditions may vary with temperature rules (e.g., northern upland cap).
- At least one observer; multiple recorders allowed to handle peak-season activity.
- Counting method: butterflies observed within an imaginary 5 m x 5 m x 5 m box in front of the observer, recorded by species for each transect section.
- Start time, end temperature, percentage sunshine, and wind speed recorded for each transect; section-by-section sunshine recorded.

## Time and effort
- 0.5–1.5 hours per transect, 26 weeks per year.

## Data collection specifics (Core data and variables)
- Core identifiers required in all datasets:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time (with time element if sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Core measurement: invertebrates – butterflies (IB Protocol)

## Weekly data (transect-level)
- Recording date, start time
- Temperature at end of recording, units °C
- Percentage sunshine
- Wind speed at end of recording, Beaufort scale (with precision)
- Habitat description and management context are reinforced at the transect level

## Section-level data (per transect section)
- Transect section number
- Species code and name
- Number seen
- Habitat description (numeric code 1–15) and BMS code
- Optional: habitat description precision for detailed interpretation; plant species that are butterfly food sources or nectar sources are noted to aid interpretation

## Data standards and transfer
- Data Transfer documentation specifies ECN dataset formats; access via restricted Site Managers' extranet (ECNCCU).
- First four core parameters uniquely identify a sample or recording occasion; subsequent fields document timing and environmental context.
- Recording forms: standard BMS forms available from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS) via Biological Records Centre.

## Recording conventions and notes
- Coding follows standard BMS practices.
- Habitat notes: include short descriptions of habitat types and lists of abundant plants per section to support interpretation (not a full plant abundance record).
- Emphasis on collecting contextual information (food and nectar plants) to aid data interpretation despite not aiming for quantitative plant abundance.
