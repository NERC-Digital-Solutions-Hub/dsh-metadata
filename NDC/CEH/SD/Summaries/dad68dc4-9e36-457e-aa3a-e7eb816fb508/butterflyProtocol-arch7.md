# IB Protocol

## Overview
- Protocol used to monitor butterfly abundance with transect methods, aligned with the national Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS) run by Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Builds on ~15 years of sampling data for comparison; supports analysis of distribution, phenology, and climate relationships (e.g., butterfly population-size responses to climate).

## Location and transect design
- Each ECN site uses a fixed transect route representative of the site; routes often follow existing paths or boundaries and may span different management regimes.
- Transect length: typically 1–2 km, walkable in 30–90 minutes; may be marked to ensure consistency across visits.
- Transect divided into up to 15 sections (sampling strata) with varying vegetation/structure/management; each section's length, habitat type, and abundant plants are recorded on a map.
- Management actions near the transect are recorded to aid interpretation.
- Mapping details support subsequent geospatial analysis and data integration.

## Recording schedule and conditions
- Recording occurs weekly from 1 April to 29 September.
- Time window: roughly 10:45 to 15:45 BST; under certain conditions, recording can occur outside this window if weather allows (subject to temperature constraints).
- Temperature thresholds depend on sunshine; but recording is allowed in most conditions if not raining; northern/uphill sites may have a different upper temperature limit (e.g., 15°C).
- Ideally more than one recorder to cover peak activity periods; transects should be walked by someone with good knowledge of British butterfly fauna.

## Data collection and observation method
- Transect walked at an even pace; butterflies seen flying within or passing through a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m imaginary box in front of the observer are recorded.
- Data recorded by section: species, count, habitat description, and relevant codes.
- Start time, temperature at end of transect, percentage sunshine, and wind speed are recorded after completing each transect.
- Section-by-section recording of percentage sunshine during progress is encouraged.

## Data standards, formats and transfer
- Data are to be submitted in formats specified by ECNCCU, with reference to accompanying Data Transfer documentation available on the restricted access Site Managers' extranet.
- Core identifiers required for each sample/recording: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Recording Date/Time.
- Core measurement: invertebrates — butterflies (IB Protocol).
- Data transfer and access: ECNCCU contact information provided for access requests.

## Data recording fields (core and per-section)
- Weekly (1 April – 29 September) recording fields at the transect level:
  - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Recording Date/Time, Start Time, Temperature at end, Percentage Sunshine, Wind Speed.
- Per transect section:
  - Section number, Species code, Species name, Number seen, Habitat description (numeric code 1–15), BMS code, Common name, Count, BMS method.
  - Habitat description precision or coding details as specified by the BMS standards.

## Recording forms
- Standard Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS) recording form available through the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood.

## Notes and guidance
- Coding should follow BMS standards.
- Habitat should be described briefly to aid interpretation, including key plant species (e.g., nectar sources and larval food plants) without attempting exhaustive plant abundance quantification.
- The aim is to support interpretation and comparison rather than to produce comprehensive plant inventories.
