# IB Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor the abundance of butterflies using transect methods of the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS).
- Leverage the well-established national scheme (ITE and JNCC) for context and comparability.
- Use historical data (~15 years) to assess changes in distribution, phenology, and relationships with climate.

## Rationale
- Butterflies respond rapidly to vegetation changes; provide a strong indicator for ecological monitoring.
- Existing data enable comparison and exploration of climate–butterfly relationships.

## Method
- Establish a fixed transect route at each site, following Hall (1981) instructions; route represents ECN site and may follow paths or boundaries.
- Transect length: typically 1–2 km; capable of being walked in 30–90 minutes.
- Transect divided into up to 15 sections (sampling strata) with records of habitat type and abundant plants; note management in the vicinity.
- Weekly recording across the transect from 1 April to 29 September.
- Observation window: 10:45–15:45 BST; temperature threshold: 13–17°C if sunshine ≥60%; if temperature >17°C, recording possible in any conditions provided it is not raining; northern upland sites capped at 15°C.
- Multiple recorders may be used to cover peak times or absences.
- Observers walk at an even pace; record butterflies seen flying within or passing through a 5 m wide, 5 m high box in front of the observer, by species for each section.
- Start time, temperature, percentage sunshine, and wind speed recorded at the end of each transect.
- Section-by-section, record percentage sunshine as the transect progresses.

## Time
- Recording occurs weekly from 1 April to 29 September.
- Typical transect duration: 0.5–1.5 hours.

## Location and sampling design
- Fixed transect route at each ECN site to ensure comparability over time.
- Route selection aims to represent the site and may include areas under different management regimes.
- Documentation of transect length, section boundaries, habitat types, and dominant plants (especially butterfly food plants).

## Recording conventions and data specification
- Data collected using standard BMS forms; standard coding and recording practices from BMS apply.
- Core variables to identify each sample:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time
- Core measurement: invertebrates – butterflies (IB Protocol)
- Weekly variables recorded for each transect: Site ID, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Recording date, Start time, Temperature at end, Percentage sunshine, Wind speed at end, with specified units and precision.
- For each transect section: transect section number, species code, species name, number seen, habitat description (numeric code 1–15), BMS code, common name, count, habitat description, and recording precision as specified.
- Additional data fields include: BMS method and other standardized metadata to enable data interoperability and long-term analyses.

## Recording forms
- A standard BMS recording form is available from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS), managed by the Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood, Abbots Ripton, Huntingdon, Cambs, UK.

## Notes and interpretation guidance
- Coding should follow BMS standards.
- Habitat descriptions should be concise; a short list of dominant plants per section is helpful to interpret results (but not a detailed plant abundance survey).
- Emphasis on butterfly food plants (e.g., nettles, violets) and nectar sources (e.g., thistles, teasels) to aid interpretation without requiring exhaustive plant abundance data.
