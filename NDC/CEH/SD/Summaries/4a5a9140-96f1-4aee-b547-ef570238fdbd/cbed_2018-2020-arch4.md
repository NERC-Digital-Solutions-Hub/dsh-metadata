# Methods

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology for generating gridded deposition data of sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations from air and precipitation measurements.
  - Outputs are used for assessing deposition and inform analyses such as critical load exceedance.

- What the CBED data represent
  - 1x1 km resolution gridded data of wet and dry deposition for:
    - Sulphur
    - Oxidised nitrogen
    - Reduced nitrogen
    - Ammonia concentration
    - Base cations
  - Derived from: gas and particulate matter in air, and ions in precipitation.
  - Data generated for five land cover categories (forest, moorland, grassland, arable, urban) and then combined to grid-square averages.
  - For critical load exceedance, moorland deposition is applied to non-woodland habitats and forest deposition to woodland habitats.

- Key data inputs and modelling steps
  - Nitric acid (HNO3) concentrations: interpolated from ~30 sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 concentrations: from PCM model (interpolated rural measurements plus point/line source modelling).
  - Ammonia (NH3) concentrations: from EMEP4UK (EMEP MSC-W model).
  - Meteorology: driven by WRF v4.2.2 with data assimilation of reanalysis from NCEP/NCAR GFS.
  - Emissions: NH3 from 2019 NAEI; non-UK emissions from CEIP 0.1° × 0.1°; UK total scaled to 2018–2019; for 2020, 2019 emissions are used.
  - Wet deposition: includes precipitation deposition plus occult deposition to vegetation; uses an orographic enhancement factor (seeder-feeder effect) derived from observations in upland regions.
  - Dry deposition: combined from gas and PM deposition with habitat-specific deposition velocities; applied to five land cover categories.

- Temporal and spatial characteristics
  - Calculations are annual but provided as rolling 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability.
  - Outputs include ecosystem-specific data for two scenarios:
    - Moorland everywhere
    - Forest everywhere
  - Additionally, provides grid-average deposition for each 3-year period.
  - Three 3-year mean data files cover moorland, forest, and grid-average values (2018–2020).

- Data products and formats
  - Deposition data expressed as kilo-equivalents per hectare per year (keq ha^-1 year^-1).
  - Conversion factors to common mass units:
    - Sulphur keq → kg S ha^-1 year^-1 (×16)
    - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen keq → kg N ha^-1 year^-1 (×14)
    - Non-marine base cations keq → kg Ca ha^-1 year^-1 (×20)
  - Files provided (2018–2020):
    - CBED-deposition-moorland-2018-2020.csv
    - CBED-deposition-forest-2018-2020.csv
    - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2018-2020.csv
  - Ammonia concentration data:
    - CBED-ammonia-conc-2018-2020.csv
  - Data columns include easting/northing (center of 5x5 km grid squares), and deposition values for NOx, NHx, NMS, and non-marine base cations (separate fields for moorland, forest, and grid average).

- Data quality, validation, and governance
  - Methods and results have undergone extensive peer review and participated in Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
  - Outputs are widely published in peer-reviewed literature.
  - Routine mass-balance checks for numerical consistency and comparisons with previous years.
  - Method developments are documented, versioned, and stored in a central system; managed by senior responsible officers.

- Data structure and accessibility
  - Data are organized by ecosystem scenario (moorland, forest) and grid-average, for 5x5 km UK grid squares.
  - Files include clear metadata for each variable (names, units, and descriptions) and standardized 3-year mean records.

- Relevance for data management and leadership
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lineage from measurements to gridded deposition products that support environmental policy analyses.
  - Highlights the importance of:
    - Interoperable data formats and clear unit conventions
    - Metadata richness and documentation for discoverability
    - Rolling-3-year aggregation to manage inter-annual variability
    - Habitat- and grid-level aggregation for flexible use across policy contexts
  - Provides a model for governance, quality assurance, and traceability in environmental data products used across networks and partnerships.
