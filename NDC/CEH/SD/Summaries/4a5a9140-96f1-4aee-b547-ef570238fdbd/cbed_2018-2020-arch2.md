# UK Acidifying and Eutrophying Atmospheric Pollutants

- The CBED (Concentration Based Estimated Deposition) methodology produces 1x1 km gridded data for wet and dry deposition of sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations, derived from air measurements and precipitation chemistry within the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network.
- Outputs are designed to support assessment of environmental health and policy performance over time, with ecosystem-specific, standardized representations (rolling 3-year means) to reduce inter-annual variability.

## Data and Methodology

- Site measurements from UKEAP are interpolated to generate national concentration maps.
- Wet deposition is calculated by combining precipitation with ion concentrations in precipitation, plus direct cloud deposition (occult) to vegetation; an orographic enhancement factor accounts for upland precipitation concentration increases.
- Dry deposition uses gas and PM concentration maps together with habitat-specific deposition velocities across five land cover categories (forest, moorland, grassland, arable, urban) to produce deposition for grid squares, then applied to moorland or forest depending on habitat.
- Critical load calculations apply moorland deposition to non-woodland habitats and forest deposition to woodland habitats.
- Concentrations:
  - Nitric acid interpolation from ~30 sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 from the PCM model (rural measurements plus sources modelling).
  - NH3 from EMEP4UK (EMEP MSC-W model).
- Meteorology from WRF v4.2.2 with data assimilation of NCEP/NCAR GFS reanalysis at 1°x1° every 6 hours.
- Anthropogenic NH3 emissions from 2019 National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI); non-UK emissions from CEIP/EMEP, with 2019 UK and 2018–2019 scaling.
- Temporal aspect: inter-annual variability exists due to weather and emissions; deposition data are averaged over three years to smooth variability; outputs are provided as rolling 3-year means.

## Outputs and Data Structure

- Data are annual in calculation but delivered as rolling 3-year means for deposition to ecosystems.
- Two ecosystem-specific 3-year means are provided:
  - Moorland/short vegetation everywhere
  - Forest/woodland everywhere
- Also provided is a grid-average 3-year mean.
- File examples (2018–2020):
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2018-2020.csv
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2018-2020.csv
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2018-2020.csv
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2018-2020.csv (ammonia concentration)
- Each file includes:
  - easting and northing (OS GB grid centre coordinates)
  - deposition values for each category (e.g., NOx, NHx, NMS, NMCaMg) in keq ha-1 yr-1
  - ammonia concentration in μg/m3
- Units and conversions:
  - Deposition values: keq ha-1 year-1
  - to kg ha-1 year-1 conversions:
    - S deposition: keq × 16
    - Oxidised/reduced N deposition: keq × 14
    - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg): keq × 20

## Data Sources and Modelling Components

- NOx and SO2: PCM model (Stedman et al., 2007) and rural measurements plus point/line source modelling
- NH3: EMEP4UK model (MSC-W)
- Meteorology: WRF v4.2.2 with Newtonian nudging of NCEP/NCAR GFS reanalysis
- Emissions: UK NH3 from NAEI (2019); non-UK from CEIP/EMEP
- Wet deposition includes precipitation-driven deposition and occult deposition to vegetation
- Orographic enhancement factor derived from height-related ion concentration observations (Great Dun Fell, Holme Moss)
- Critical load context: deposition values used to assess exceedance, with habitat-specific application (moorland vs forest)

## Quality Control and Documentation

- Methods follow QA procedures aligned with government analytical model QA guidelines.
- CBED data and calculations have undergone extensive peer review and inter-comparison exercises (e.g., Carslaw 2011).
- Results published in peer-reviewed literature; formal documentation and version control practices in place.
- Mass balance checks performed to ensure numerical consistency and temporal consistency with previous years.
