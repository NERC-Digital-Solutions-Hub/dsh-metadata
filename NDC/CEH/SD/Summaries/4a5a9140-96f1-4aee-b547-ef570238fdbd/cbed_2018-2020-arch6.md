# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- Purpose: Generates 1x1 km resolution gridded data of wet and dry deposition for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations using measured air concentrations and precipitation ion measurements from the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network.

- Data inputs and sources:
  - Gas and particulate concentrations in air; ion concentrations in precipitation.
  - Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 sites; NO2/SO2 from PCM model; NH3 from EMEP4UK.
  - Meteorology from WRF v4.2.2 with data assimilation of NCEP/NCAR GFS reanalysis (1°x1° every 6 hours).
  - Anthropogenic NH3 emissions from 2019 NAEI; non-UK emissions from CEIP data (0.1° resolution); 2020 uses 2019 emissions.
  - Annual precipitation map (UK Met Office) used to compute wet deposition.

- Processing workflow:
  - Site measurements interpolated to create UK concentration maps.
  - Wet deposition derived by combining gas/PM concentration maps with precipitation data.
  - Dry deposition computed by applying habitat-specific deposition velocities to concentration maps across five land cover categories: forest, moorland, grassland, arable, urban.
  - Deposition to grid squares weighted by land cover proportions to produce grid-square deposition values.
  - Critical load exceedance: apply moorland deposition to non-woodland habitats and forest deposition to woodland habitats.
  - Wet deposition includes direct deposition of cloud droplets (occult deposition) with an orographic enhancement factor for uplands (seeder-feeder effect).
  - Inter-annual variability is smoothed by using rolling 3-year means; outputs are provided as annual calculations but delivered as 3-year means.

- Temporal and spatial resolution:
  - Primary outputs are provided as 3-year rolling means, ecosystem-specific.
  - Ecosystem options: moorland-only, forest/woodland, or grid average across each 5x5 km UK grid square.
  - Data files represent 5x5 km grid squares with coordinates given as easting/northing (metres).

- Data products and structure:
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2018-2020.csv: deposition to moorland by 5x5 km grid (nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m, nm_ca_mg_m).
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2018-2020.csv: deposition to forest by 5x5 km grid (nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f).
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2018-2020.csv: grid-average deposition (nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga).
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2018-2020.csv: ammonia concentration (nh3_c) with easting/northing.
  - Each file includes coordinates for the center of the 5x5 km grid and corresponding deposition values in keq ha-1 year-1.

- Units and conversions:
  - Deposition values are expressed as keq ha-1 year-1.
  - Conversions to kg units:
    - Sulphur deposition: keq × 16 = kg S ha-1 year-1
    - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition: keq × 14 = kg N ha-1 year-1
    - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg): keq × 20 = kg Ca ha-1 year-1

- Quality control and validation:
  - Methods align with government QA for analytical models; extensive peer review over years.
  - Part of Defra model inter-comparison (Carslaw 2011) and widely published in peer-reviewed literature.
  - Documentation, version control, and centralized code storage.
  - Mass balance checks and comparisons to previous years to ensure numerical consistency.
