# Methods

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology to produce 1x1 km resolution gridded deposition data for sulfur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations from air concentrations and precipitation ions. Outputs support assessment of ecosystem deposition and critical load exceedances across the UK.

- Data inputs and sources
  - Gas and PM concentration maps derived from measurements at the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network.
  - Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 from the Pollution Concentration Mapping (PCM) model (rural measurements plus point/line source modelling).
  - Ammonia concentrations from EMEP4UK (UK application of the EMEP MSC-W transport model).
  - Meteorology from the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model (v4.2.2) with data assimilation from NCEP/NCAR GFS reanalysis.
  - Anthropogenic NH3 emissions from the 2019 National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI); non-UK emissions from CEIP EMEP data.
  - For 2020, 2019 emissions were used.

- Calculation and data fusion process
  - Site measurements are interpolated to generate UK-wide concentration maps.
  - Annual precipitation map (UK Met Office) used to convert ion concentrations to wet deposition.
  - Gas and PM concentration maps combined with habitat-specific deposition velocities to compute dry deposition for five land-cover categories: forest, moorland, grassland, arable, and urban.
  - Deposition to each 1x1 km grid square is weighted by the grid’s land-cover proportions to produce grid-square averaged deposition.
  - Dry deposition includes deposition of gases (SO2, HNO3, NO2, NH3) and particulate matter (SO4, NO3, NH4, Ca, Mg) to vegetation.
  - For critical load calculations, deposition values for moorland are applied to all non-woodland habitats, and forest deposition values are applied to all woodland habitats.

- Temporal characteristics
  - Outputs are produced as annual values but are provided as rolling 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability (significant year-to-year fluctuations due to weather and emissions).
  - 3-year means are ecosystem-specific with two scenarios: moorland/short vegetation everywhere and forest everywhere; grid-average values are also provided.

- Spatial framing and data structure
  - Outputs are provided at 5x5 km grid squares (with references to 1x1 km resolution deposition calculations); three datasets per use-case:
    - CBED-deposition-moorland-2018-2020.csv (moorland deposition components)
    - CBED-deposition-forest-2018-2020.csv (forest deposition components)
    - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2018-2020.csv (grid-average deposition components)
  - Each CSV includes easting and northing (grid center coordinates) and deposition components in keq ha^-1 yr^-1:
    - Moorland: oxidised nitrogen (nox_m), reduced nitrogen (nhx_m), non-marine sulfur (nms_m), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_m)
    - Forest: oxidised nitrogen (nox_f), reduced nitrogen (nhx_f), non-marine sulfur (nms_f), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_f)
    - Grid average: oxidised nitrogen (nox_ga), reduced nitrogen (nhx_ga), non-marine sulfur (nms_ga), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_ga)
  - Ammonia concentration data (ammonia concentration in μg/m^3) provided in CBED-ammonia-conc-2018-2020.csv with coordinates (easting, northing) and nh3_c values.

- Units and conversion
  - All deposition values are in keq ha^-1 yr^-1.
  - For interpretation, conversions are provided:
    - Sulphur deposition (keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 16 = kg S ha^-1 yr^-1)
    - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition (keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 14 = kg N ha^-1 yr^-1)
    - Non-marine base cations (keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 20 = kg Ca ha^-1 yr^-1)

- Quality control and governance
  - CBED methods align with quality assurance standards for government analytical models and have undergone peer review and participation in Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
  - Results published in peer-reviewed literature; method developments are version-controlled and documented; model code is stored centrally.
  - Mass-balance checks ensure numerical consistency and comparisons to previous years.

- Relevance to monitoring and decision-making
  - Provides spatially explicit deposition metrics essential for evaluating policy interventions, understanding ecosystem exposure, and informing future environmental health decisions.
  - The rolling 3-year means help policymakers interpret trends while accounting for natural variability and measurement uncertainties.
