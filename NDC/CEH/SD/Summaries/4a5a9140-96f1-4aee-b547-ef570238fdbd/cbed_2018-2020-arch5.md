# Methods

- Purpose: Describe the Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology used to generate 1x1 km resolution gridded deposition data for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations from air and precipitation measurements, for the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network.

- Outputs and coverage:
  - Wet deposition (including occult deposition to vegetation) and dry deposition to five land cover categories: forest, moorland, grassland, arable, and urban.
  - Grid-square averaged deposition values produced by combining land-cover-specific deposition with 1x1 km grid compositions.
  - Deposition values applied to non-woodland habitats (moorland) or woodland habitats (forest) as appropriate.
  - Data are provided as rolling 3-year means, annual values computed but presented as 3-year averages, and available in ecosystem-specific forms.

- Measurements and data sources:
  - Nitrogen and sulfur species: NOx/NO3, NHx, non-marine SOx/SO4, ammonium, nitrate, calcium, magnesium.
  - Ammonia concentrations (NH3) from EMEP4UK; NO2/NO3 interpolated from measurements and PCM model data; SO2 data from PCM model.
  - Meteorology from WRF v4.2.2 with data assimilation of NCEP/NCAR GFS reanalysis (1°x1°) every 6 hours.
  - Emissions: UK NH3 from 2019 NAEI, rescaled to 2018/2019; non-UK emissions from CEIP CEIP 0.1°×0.1° data; for 2020, 2019 emissions were used.

- Wet vs dry deposition:
  - Wet deposition uses precipitation data and an orographic enhancement factor based on observations in upland regions.
  - Dry deposition uses deposition velocities and combines gas and PM deposition to vegetation; orographic effects are not specified for dry deposition in detail.

- Spatial and temporal resolution:
  - Grid: 1x1 km resolution; data aggregated to grade 5x5 km squares for the 3x3 grid structure (moorland, forest, grid average).
  - Three-year averaging to smooth inter-annual variability due to weather patterns, with four ecosystem-specific data sets:
    - Moorland deposition
    - Forest/woodland deposition
    - Grid-average deposition
  - Time frame: annual deposition values averaged over a rolling 3-year period; 3-year means are provided for each grid square and ecosystem category.

- Data structure and file formats:
  - Data provided as three CSV files for the 2018–2020 period:
    - CBED-deposition-moorland-2018-2020.csv
    - CBED-deposition-forest-2018-2020.csv
    - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2018-2020.csv
  - Each CSV includes:
    - easting and northing (OS GB grid centre in metres)
    - species-specific deposition values in keq ha^-1 year^-1 (nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m, nm_ca_mg_m for moorland; nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f for forest; nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga for grid average)
  - Ammonia concentration file:
    - CBED-ammonia-conc-2018-2020.csv with easting, northing, and nh3_c (μg m^-3)
  - Units: all deposition values expressed as keq ha^-1 year^-1; ammonia concentration in μg m^-3.
  - Unit conversion factors to kg S, N, Ca for interpretation:
    - Sulphur deposition: keq ha^-1 year^-1 × 16 = kg S ha^-1 year^-1
    - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition: keq ha^-1 year^-1 × 14 = kg N ha^-1 year^-1
    - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg): keq ha^-1 year^-1 × 20 = kg Ca ha^-1 year^-1

- Data quality and provenance:
  - Methods and results have undergone extensive peer review and model inter-comparison (e.g., Carslaw 2011) and are published in peer-reviewed literature.
  - Documentation, versioning, and central storage practices are followed; mass-balance checks ensure numerical consistency and comparisons with previous years are performed.
  - Method developments are approved by senior responsible officers; code and documentation are stored in a central file system.

  - References include foundational models and data sources (PCM model, EMEP4UK, WRF, NAEI, CEIP) and supporting literature on deposition modelling and atmospheric chemistry.

- Reuse considerations and limitations:
  - Data reflect averaged deposition across 2018–2020 with UK-wide and land-cover- specific applications; local heterogeneity and inter-annual variability may affect site-specific interpretation.
  - For critical-load calculations, the deposition values may be tailored by land-cover class (moorland vs forest) and grid-average assumptions.
  - 2020 data utilize 2019 emission estimates (where noted), which should be considered when comparing with more recent years.
