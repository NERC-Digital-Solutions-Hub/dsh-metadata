# Methods

## Overview
- Describes the Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology for generating deposition data and ammonia concentration maps related to UK air pollutants.
- Outputs include wet and dry deposition of sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations, produced as gridded data for GIS use.
- Data are prepared as 3-year rolling means on a UK grid, with ecosystem-specific (moorland or forest) and grid-average deposition values.

## Data inputs and sources
- Gas and particulate matter concentrations are mapped from site measurements and models:
  - Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 UK sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 from the PCM model (Stedman et al., 2007).
  - Ammonia concentrations from the EMEP4UK model; meteorology driven by WRF v4.2.2 with data assimilation from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis.
- Emissions data:
  - Anthropogenic NH3 from the 2019 National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI); UK total scaled for 2018–2019.
  - Non-UK emissions from CEIP (0.1° × 0.1°), UK total used for 2018–2019; 2020 uses 2019 emissions.
- Wet deposition includes precipitation deposition plus direct cloud droplet deposition (occult deposition) and an orographic enhancement factor for upland regions.
- Inter-annual variability is acknowledged and mitigated by using 3-year means.

## Deposition calculation approach
- Dry deposition:
  - Gas and PM concentration maps combined with habitat-specific deposition velocities to estimate dry deposition for five land cover categories: forest, moorland, grassland, arable, and urban.
  - Deposition per grid cell weighted by the relative proportions of land cover within that cell.
- Wet deposition:
  - Based on precipitation, with additional wet/dry deposition processes accounted for (e.g., occult deposition).
- Critical load context:
  - For exceedance calculations, deposition values for moorland are applied to all non-woodland habitats; deposition values for forest are applied to all woodland habitats.

## Temporal aggregation and data products
- Calculations are annual but presented as rolling 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability.
- Data are provided as ecosystem-specific 3-year means:
  - Moorland everywhere
  - Forest/Woodland everywhere
  - Grid average everywhere
- Grid resolution: data are provided for 5x5 km grid squares (center coordinates given in easting/northing).

## Output data structure and files
- Deposition data files (3-year means for 2018–2020):
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2018-2020.csv
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2018-2020.csv
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2018-2020.csv
- Ammonia concentration data file:
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2018-2020.csv
- File fields (example structure):
  - easting (metres), northing (metres)
  - deposition terms per grid: nox (oxidised nitrogen), nhx (reduced nitrogen), nms (non-marine sulphur), nm_ca_mg (non-marine base cations)
  - units: keq ha-1 year-1
  - ammonia file: nh3_c (μg m-3)
- Data are designed for GIS use, with each row representing a 5x5 km grid center.

## Units and conversions
- Reported units: keq ha-1 year-1 for all deposition values.
- Conversion factors to common mass units:
  - Sulphur deposition: keq ha-1 year-1 × 16 = kg S ha-1 year-1
  - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition: keq ha-1 year-1 × 14 = kg N ha-1 year-1
  - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg): keq ha-1 year-1 × 20 = kg Ca ha-1 year-1

## Quality control
- Methods align with QA standards for Government analytical models and have undergone extensive peer review.
- Involvement in model inter-comparison exercises (e.g., Defra) and widespread publication.
- Documentation practices include versioned method developments and centralized code storage.
- Mass balance checks are routinely performed to ensure numerical consistency with previous years.
