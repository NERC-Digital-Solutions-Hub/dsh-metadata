# UK Acidifying and Eutrophying Atmospheric Pollutants

## Purpose and scope
- Presents the Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology to produce gridded deposition data for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations.
- Data support assessment of acidifying and eutrophying pollutant impacts in the UK, including critical load exceedance analyses.

## Methodology at a glance
- CBED generates deposition values from measured air/gas and precipitation data collected in the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network.
- Two main deposition pathways:
  - Wet deposition: derived by multiplying ion concentrations in precipitation by an annual precipitation map; includes occult (direct cloud droplet) deposition.
  - Dry deposition: derived from gas/PM concentrations and habitat-specific deposition velocities across five land-cover categories (forest, moorland, grassland, arable, urban).
- Deposition values per grid square are weighted by the relative proportions of each land-cover category within the square.

## Land-cover and ecosystem application
- For critical loads:
  - Moorland deposition applied to all non-woodland habitats.
  - Forest deposition applied to all woodland habitats.
- Ecosystem-specific outputs include separate values for moorland-only, forest-only, and a grid-average deposition, plus an overall 3-year rolling mean.

## Data inputs and spatial/temporal resolution
- Pollutants and inputs:
  - Nitrogen (oxidised NOx/NO3, reduced NHx NH3/NH4), sulphur (non-marine SOx), non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg), and ammonia concentrations.
  - Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 from the PCM model; ammonia from EMEP4UK.
  - Meteorology from WRF v4.2.2 with NCEP/NCAR reanalysis nudging.
  - Anthropogenic NH3 emissions from 2019 NAEI; UK total scaled to 2018–2019.
  - Non-UK emissions from CEIP EMEP data; 2018/2019 UK totals used for UK emissions; 2020 uses 2019 emissions.
- Resolution:
  - Initial concentration/deposition maps at 1x1 km resolution.
  - Deposition aggregated to 5x5 km grid squares for output; results are provided as 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability.

## Temporal handling
- Inter-annual variability influenced by weather and atmospheric processes.
- 3-year means used for exceedance calculations and presented as rolling 3-year averages.
- Wet deposition includes both rainfall deposition and occult deposition (cloud interactions), with an orographic enhancement factor for upland regions.

## Data outputs and structure
- All deposition values are expressed as keq ha^-1 yr^-1.
- Conversion factors:
  - Sulphur deposition: keq → kg S by multiplying by 16.
  - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen: keq → kg N by multiplying by 14.
  - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg): keq → kg Ca by multiplying by 20.
- Output data sets (examples):
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2018-2020.csv: moorland deposition (NOx_m, NHx_m, NMS_m, NM_CA_mg_m) by 5x5 km grid with easting/northing coordinates.
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2018-2020.csv: forest deposition (NOx_f, NHx_f, NMS_f, NM_CA_mg_f).
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2018-2020.csv: grid-average deposition (NOx_ga, NHx_ga, NMS_ga, NM_CA_mg_ga).
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2018-2020.csv: ammonia concentration (nh3_c) by grid center.
- Data files include clear field definitions (easting, northing, and pollutant deposition components) for 5x5 km grid squares.

## Quality control and governance
- Methods align with formal QA practices for government analytical models.
- Peer-reviewed and part of model inter-comparison exercises (Defra).
- Mass-balance checks and consistency tests against previous years.
- Documented method developments with version control and central code storage.
- Approach validated by collaboration with senior responsible officers and experts.

## How analysts can use this data
- Assess spatial patterns and three-year trends in acidifying and eutrophying deposition across the UK at 5x5 km (with 1x1 km origins) and by ecosystem type (moorland/forest) or grid-average.
- Support critical load exceedance analyses with harmonised deposition inputs, including both wet and dry components.
- Compare modeled deposition against emissions scenarios or policy interventions, while accounting for inter-annual variability smoothed by rolling means.
- Utilize the provided units and conversion factors to translate keq ha^-1 yr^-1 into kg S, N, or Ca for impact assessments.
