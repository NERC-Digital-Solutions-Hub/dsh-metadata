# BC Protocol

- Aim
  - To record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites.
  - CBC (Common Birds Census) started in 1962 to monitor bird populations, especially in farmland, with later inclusion of woodland.
  - Uses a map-based approach with a series of visits to defined plots to estimate territory numbers and relate changes to habitat changes; results support linking to regional and national patterns.

- Location
  - Plot should be a minimum of 40 ha in farmland and 10 ha in woodland; ECN sites should target these sizes where possible.
  - Edge effects should be minimized by reducing edge/area ratio.
  - Boundaries must be clearly discernible features and mapped on a 1:2500 map; if natural features are insufficient, grid the area at 50 m intervals and mark grid positions semipermanently.

- Habitat recording
  - Record habitat features within the plot and extending 50–100 m beyond the boundaries to relate bird populations to habitat features.
  - Map important habitat changes during the recording year or from year to year; follow provided instructions for habitat description.

- Frequency and timing
  - Ten visits per year between mid-March and late June (adjust for northern sites); visits should be evenly spaced, with weekly cadence ideal.
  - A complete visit takes ~3–4 hours; prefer eight morning visits (before 0900 BST) and two early evening visits (after 1700).
  - Avoid cold, windy, wet days; on good days, start early.

- Bird recording
  - Objective is to mark the location and movements of every bird present during a visit, recording each individual once.
  - Use standard conventions for species and activities; some species have specialised counting rules (e.g., nests counted if nesting, otherwise noted).
  - Coverage should be as even as possible; vary route start points and directions between visits.
  - Farmland: ensure coverage along major hedgerows and around plot perimeter; woodland: use routes that bring the observer within 50 m of every part of the plot each visit; most contacts in woodland are by sound.
  - End-of-season outputs include separate species maps and analyses of territories; a summary sheet reports presence and nest counts by species.

- Specification of results and recording conventions
  - Data collection at ECN Sites uses standardized parameters; the first four key parameters uniquely identifying each sample are essential:
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date/time
  - Data formats and ECN dataset specifications are available via the restricted-access ECNCCU extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
  - Ten visits per year, map-based recording for each visit, and the associated metadata (start/finish times, weather, area surveyed, etc.) are defined to support cross-site comparison and analysis.

- Recording forms
  - Standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field recording forms available from the Census Unit of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) for data submission and map preparation.
  - A field recording form for moorland birds is available from the ECN Census and Communications Unit (CCU).

- Notes
  - References and instructions for BTO CBC habitat mapping, species codes, and bird activity mapping symbols are detailed in the CBC documentation (pages cited in the protocol).
