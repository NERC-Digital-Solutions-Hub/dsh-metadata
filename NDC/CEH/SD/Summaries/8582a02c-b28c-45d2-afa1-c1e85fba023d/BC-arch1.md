# BC Protocol

- Aim and scope
  - Record annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites.
  - Monitor bird population numbers, initially on farmland and later including woodland; link site data to regional and national patterns.
  - Use a map-based method: series of visits to all parts of a defined plot during the breeding season; compile data to estimate territory numbers and population change indices.

- Plot design and location
  - Plot size: minimum 40 ha in farmland; minimum 10 ha in woodland (with recognition that minimums may not always be achievable).
  - Edge effects: minimize by reducing edge/area ratio.
  - Boundaries: clearly discernible features; documented on a 1:2500 map; if natural features are insufficient, grid at 50 m intervals with semi-permanent marks.

- Habitat recording
  - Record habitat features within the plot and extending 50–100 m beyond boundaries.
  - Map important habitat changes during the recording year or year-to-year, with separate mapping for significant changes.

- Frequency and timing
  - Ten visits per ECN site per year, between mid-March and late June (adjust for northern sites).
  - Visits evenly spaced; ideally eight morning visits (before 0900 BST) plus two early evening visits (after 1700).
  - Each complete visit lasts about 3–4 hours; weather conditions influence scheduling.

- Bird recording (field method)
  - Objective: map location and movements of every bird present or flying over during a visit, recording each individual only once.
  - Standardized conventions for species and activities to ensure clarity and comparability.
  - Species-specific recording rules (examples):
    - Grey heron, rook, sand martin, feral pigeon, all gulls/terns: counted if nesting; present but not nesting noted in margins.
    - Wood pigeon, swift, swallow, house martin, magpie, jackdaw, carrion crow, house sparrow, starling: censused by nest counts or a combination of nest counts and normal registrations.
    - Some winter visitors (e.g., fieldfare, redwing, brambling) may be ignored.
  - Plot coverage: aim for even coverage; allocate more time to high-density areas; vary route direction and starting point between visits.
  - Woodland method: route within 50 m of every part of the plot per visit; often more acoustic detection.
  - Data recording: use visit-specific codes, weather, start/end times, and extent of coverage; compile separate species maps at year-end to show territories.

- Data processing and outputs
  - Separate species maps per visit; combine maps across visits to show territories occupied by each species.
  - Produce a summary sheet showing presence by species and nest counts.
  - Data linked to habitat changes to assess relationships with population dynamics.

- Data specification and transfer (key data concepts for analysts)
  - First four core identifiers required for every dataset:
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date/time
  - Ten visits per year (mid-March to late June) with standardized timing and recorded metadata.
  - Recorded variables for each visit include:
    - Start time and finish time (BST 24-h clock)
    - Visit code (BTO code A–K)
    - Habitat features and extent of area surveyed
    - Species present and nest location (with BTO codes)
    - Bird activity codes and weather description
    - Area of survey, altitude (median and range), and territory counts by species
  - Data formats and transfer documents are available via the ECNCCU site and require proper metadata for discoverability.

- Recording forms and materials
  - CBC standard summary sheets and BBS field recording forms available from the Census Unit (BTO).
  - CBC outline maps prepared by the BTO; moorland bird field form available from ECN Central Coordination Unit.

- Notes and references
  - Habitat mapping instructions, species codes, and bird activity mapping symbols provided in BTO CBC materials (pages referenced in original documentation).
