# BC Protocol

- Aim
  - Record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites.
  - Initiated in 1962 to monitor farmland bird populations amidst agricultural chemical use and hedgerow loss; later included woodland and other habitats.
  - Uses a mapping-based method: multiple visits to a defined plot during the breeding season to map bird locations by sight or sound, enabling estimation of territories and comparison with regional/national patterns.
  - Outputs inform understanding of year-to-year changes and habitat links; results can be linked across ECN sites.

- Location (Plot and boundaries)
  - Plots: at least 40 ha in farmland (arable, horticultural, or grazing) and 10 ha in woodland; ECN sites should aim to meet these sizes.
  - Edge effects minimized by reducing edge/area ratio.
  - Boundaries marked on a 1:2500 map with internal details; if natural features are insufficient, the area is gridded at 50 m intervals with visible, semi-permanent grid marks.

- Habitat recording
  - Record habitat features of the plot and extending 50–100 m beyond boundaries to relate populations to habitat.
  - Map important habitat changes during the year or year to year.
  - Instructions for habitat description provided in the protocol.

- Frequency and timing
  - Ten visits between mid-March and late June (northward adjustments as needed); visits spaced through the season, weekly ideal.
  - Full visit duration about 3–4 hours.
  - Suggested schedule: eight morning visits before 09:00 BST and two early-season evening visits after 17:00; avoid adverse weather.

- Bird recording (method)
  - Objective: mark the location and movements of every bird present or flying over during a visit, counting each individual only once.
  - Standard conventions for species and activities used to ensure clear, unambiguous recording.
  - Species-specific procedures:
    - Group 1: Grey heron, rook, sand martin, feral pigeon, all gulls/terns — nest counts if nesting; if present but not nesting, note on visit map margin.
    - Group 2: Wood pigeon, swift, swallow, house martin, magpie, jackdaw, carrion crow, house sparrow, starling — census by nest count or a mix of nest counts and registrations.
    - Group 3: Fieldfare, redwing, brambling, and other common winter visitors — ignore for the breeding season map.
  - Coverage guidance:
    - Farmland: traverse major internal hedgerows and the full plot perimeter; more time where density is higher.
    - Woodland: within 50 m of every part of the plot each visit; use a marked grid line as needed; most contacts by sound.
  - Route and data handling:
    - Route direction and starting point varied between visits.
    - Each visit has a code, date, start time, weather, finish time, and extent of plot coverage recorded.
    - Separate species maps are produced at season end, combining data from all visits to show territory locations; these are analyzed to determine territories by species.
  - Outputs: end-of-season species maps and a summary sheet showing presence and nest counts by species.

- Specification of results and recording conventions
  - Data specification for ECN sites includes core metadata and sampling specifics:
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05) — unique site code.
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC) — unique for each ECN core measurement.
    - Location Code (e.g., 01) — replicates sampling locations within a site for a core measurement.
    - Sampling Date/time — date and time of data collection; time element if sampling is more frequent than daily.
  - Common birds (BC) data: ten visits per year (mid-March to late June) with map-based recording per visit; presence and nest data by species summarized on a sheet.
  - Recording units/fields referenced for data transfer formats (ECN dataset formats) and availability via restricted extranet (Site Managers' extranet); contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

- Recording forms
  - 1) Standard CBC summary sheets and BTO field recording forms (CBC summary sheets typically prepared by BTO from interpreted maps).
  - 2) A field recording form for moorland birds (availability details provided by CBC unit).

- Notes
  - BTO habitat mapping instructions (pp 174–176) and BTO species codes (p 177) and bird activity mapping symbols (p 178) provide reference detail for coding and interpretation.
  - The CBC data collection and mapping framework is designed to produce presence, nest counts, and territory estimates that can be aggregated and analyzed in relation to habitat features and broader regional patterns.
