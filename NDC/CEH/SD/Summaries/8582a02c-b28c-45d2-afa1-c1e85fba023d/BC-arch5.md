# BC Protocol

## Aim
- To record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites.
- Started in 1962 as CBC to monitor farmland bird populations and effects of agricultural chemicals and hedgerow destruction; later expanded to include woodland.
- Uses a map-based method: series of visits to a defined plot during the breeding season; birds recorded by sight or sound on large-scale maps.
- Data are used to estimate territories, assess year-to-year changes, and relate site patterns to regional/national trends.
- Method summary follows BTO observer instructions (Marchant 1983).

## Study Area and Plot Setup
- Plot size: minimum 40 ha in farmland; minimum 10 ha in woodland (semi-natural broadleaved/mixed). Edge effects minimized by reducing edge/area ratio.
- Boundaries: clearly discernible features (permanent landscape features or marked grid); boundaries mapped on 1:2500 map with internal details (tracks, buildings, hedges, trees).
- If natural features are insufficient, area is gridded at 50 m intervals with visible, semi-permanent grid positions.
- ECN sites should aim to meet these minimums, but practical constraints may apply.

## Habitat Recording
- Record habitat features within the plot and extending 50–100 m beyond boundaries.
- Map habitat features before the first year; map important habitat changes during or between years.
- Follow provided instructions for habitat description.

## Data Collection Schedule

- Visits: Ten visits between mid-March and late June (adjusted northwards as needed).
- Timing: Evenly spaced through season; eight morning visits (before 0900 BST) plus two early-season evenings (after 1700); complete visit lasts ~3–4 hours.
- Weather: Cold, windy, or wet days should be avoided; start earlier on fine days.

## Bird Recording Protocol

- Objective: Mark the location and movements of every bird present or flying over during a visit, recording each individual only once.
- Conventions: Use standard codes for species/activities to ensure clear, unambiguous recordings.
- Special cases (nesting vs. presence): 
  - Grey heron, rook, sand martin, feral pigeon, gulls/terns: count/record active nests if nesting; otherwise note presence on margin.
  - Wood pigeon, swift, swallow, house martin, magpie, jackdaw, carrion crow, house sparrow, starling: censused by nest counts or a combination of nest counts and registrations.
  - Fieldfare, redwing, brambling, and other common winter visitors: generally ignored.
- Coverage: Strive for even coverage; vary route direction and starting point between visits.
- Woodland vs. farmland: In farmland, survey along hedgerows and perimeter; in woodland, survey within 50 m of all plot parts (may require a marked grid line and compass).
- Data per visit: Record visit code, date, start/finish times, weather, and extent of plot coverage.
- End-of-season: Create separate species maps aggregating data from all visits to show territory occupancy; analyze territories per species.

## Data Specification, Recording Conventions, and Data Formats

- Core data elements (four key identifiers) needed for every sampling location:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time (with time elements if sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Sampling and recording dataset structure: Ten visits per year; map-based recording per visit; units and precision defined (as per ECNCCU data specification).
- Data transfer: Reference to ECN dataset formats and Data Transfer documentation; restricted access via the Site Managers' extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
- Recording outputs: Summary sheets and maps; presence of birds and nest counts by species; territories by species.

## Data Formats and Access

- Recording forms:
  - CBC standard summary sheets and BBS field recording forms available from the BTO Census Unit.
  - CBC outline maps prepared by BTO.
  - Moorland bird field form available from the CCU.
- Data access and documentation:
  - Data transfer documentation for ECNCCU datasets available on the restricted extranet.
  - ECN Site Management requires a site code, sampling codes, and time-stamped observations.
  - Data are intended to be analyzable to show territories and population changes across years and sites.

## Notes and References

- Habitat mapping instructions (pp. 174–176), BTO species codes (p. 177), and bird activity mapping symbols (p. 178) provide detailed conventions.

## Data Stewardship Considerations

- Data standards and interoperability
  - Use of fixed codes (Site Identification, Core Measurement, Location, Sampling Date/time) ensures consistent aggregation across ECN sites.
  - Standardized habitat and species recording conventions enable cross-site comparisons and longitudinal analyses.
- Metadata and provenance
  - Document plot boundaries, map scales, and grid methods; preserve habitat feature descriptions and boundary decisions.
  - Record visit-level metadata (start/finish times, weather, coverage extent) to support reproducibility and quality checks.
- Data quality and validation
  - Ensure each bird is recorded only once per visit; apply species-specific recording rules (nest counts vs. detections) to maintain consistency.
  - Compile end-of-season species maps to verify territorial estimates and detect changes over time.
- Data storage, access, and governance
  - Store data in ECNCCU-compatible formats; provide access via restricted extranet with documented contact points (ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk).
  - Maintain versioned summary sheets and maps; preserve original field-recorded maps and habitat maps for auditing.
- Challenges alignment
  - The protocol accommodates data from diverse habitats (farmland and woodland) and observers; ongoing guidance may be required to handle edge effects, grid-based positioning, and observer variability.
  - Longitudinal data integrity depends on consistent application of codes, timing, and habitat mapping across years and sites.
