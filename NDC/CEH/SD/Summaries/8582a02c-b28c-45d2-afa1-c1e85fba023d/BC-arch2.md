# BC Protocol

- Aim
  - Record annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites.
  - CBC (Common Birds Census) started in 1962 to monitor bird populations, initially on farmland and later including woodland.
  - Uses a mapping method with repeated visits to defined plots to estimate territory numbers; allows comparison with regional and national patterns.
  - Outputs include year-to-year abundance changes and links to habitat changes; information feeds ECN site comparisons and broader ecological understanding.

- Location and plot design
  - Plot size: minimum 40 ha in farmland (arable, horticultural, or grazing) and 10 ha in woodland; peak suitability for ECN sites, though minimums may not always be achievable.
  - Edge effects should be minimised by reducing edge/area ratio.
  - Boundaries: clearly discernible features; marked on a 1:2500 map with internal detail (tracks, buildings, hedges, trees). If natural features are insufficient, area grid (50 m intervals) should be marked semipermanently for position judgement.

- Habitat recording
  - Record habitat features within the plot and extending 50–100 m beyond boundaries on a map before the first year.
  - Map important habitat changes during the recording year or year-to-year.
  - Follow specific instructions for habitat description (refer to provided pages in the protocol).

- Frequency and timing
  - Ten visits per year between mid-March and late June (northward adjustments may be needed).
  - Visits evenly spaced; weekly visits ideal.
  - Each complete visit lasts ~3–4 hours; typically eight morning visits (before 0900 BST) plus two early-season evening visits (after 1700).
  - Avoid cold, windy, wet days; start times adjusted for weather.

- Bird recording (field procedure)
  - Objective: mark the location and movements of every bird present or flying over during a visit, recording each individual only once.
  - Use standard conventions for species, activity, and locations to ensure consistency across observers.
  - Special handling for certain species (e.g., nests counted; presence noted if not nesting); rules differ for a list of select species.
  - Coverage: aim for even plot coverage; in farmland, ensure traversal of major hedgerows and full perimeter; in woodland, ensure within 50 m of all plot parts, often relying on sound.
  - Route should vary between visits; a visit is identified by a code, date, start time, weather, etc.
  - Separate species maps are produced at the season’s end, combining visits to show territories per species.

- Specification of results and recording conventions
  - Core dataset parameters essential for ECN Site data: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
  - Ten visits per year documented with map-based locations, bird presence/behavior, nest counts, and territories by species.
  - Data are subject to ECNCCU data transfer documentation and site-level data specifications (see restricted extranet). Contact ECNCCU for access if needed.

- Recording forms and data standards
  - Forms available: standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field recording forms; CBC outline maps prepared by BTO.
  - Field recording form for moorland birds available from the Census Unit.
  - Documentation includes habitat mapping instructions, BTO species codes, bird activity mapping symbols, and conversion to interpretive forms.
  - Data fields include: site code, core measurement code, location code, start/finish times, visit code, area coverage, altitude, species present, territories, nest counts, and weather.

- Data handling and outputs
  - Individual yearly results include presence/absence, nest counts by species, and territories.
  - Output products include species-specific maps per visit and a summary sheet detailing presence and nesting for each species.
  - Analyses link mapped locations to habitat features to derive patterns in territory occupancy and population change.

- Data access and transfer
  - Data submitted to ECN Site datasets; ECNCCU provides data transfer documentation and access via restricted extranet.
  - For access to documentation: ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.
