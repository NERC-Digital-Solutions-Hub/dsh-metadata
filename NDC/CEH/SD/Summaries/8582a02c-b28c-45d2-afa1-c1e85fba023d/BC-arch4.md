# BC Protocol

## Aim
- To record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites.
- Established in 1962 (following 1961 trials) to monitor bird populations, initially on farmland and later including woodland.
- Uses a mapping method with a series of visits to all parts of a defined plot during the breeding season; combines data to estimate territories and population change indices.
- Enables linkage of ECN site data to regional and national patterns.

## Method overview
- CBC (Common Birds Census) method records habitat features and bird movements/activities on large-scale maps; results are analyzed to show territories occupied by different species.
- A summary sheet provides presence of birds and nest counts by species.

## Location and plot design
- Plot size requirements: minimum 40 ha in farmland (arable, horticultural, or grazing land) and minimum 10 ha in woodland (semi-natural broadleaved/mixed); edge effects should be minimised by reducing edge/area ratio.
- Boundaries must be clearly discernible features (permanent landscape features or an artificial grid).
- Boundaries drawn on a 1:2500 map with internal details; if natural features are insufficient, the area is gridded at 50 m intervals with visible, semi-permanent grid positions.

## Habitat recording
- Record habitat features within the plot and extending 50–100 m beyond the boundaries on a map before the first year; map important habitat changes during the year or year-to-year.
- Instructions for habitat description are provided in the protocol.

## Frequency and timing
- Ten visits per year (mid-March to late June; northern sites require adjustments) with evenly spaced visits; weekly visits ideal.
- Each complete visit lasts ~3–4 hours.
- Scheduling: eight morning visits starting before 0900 BST and two early-season evening visits after 1700.
- Poor weather days should be avoided; on fine days an early start is advised.

## Bird recording
- Objective: mark the location and movements of every bird present or flying over during a visit, but record each individual only once per visit.
- A standard set of conventions for species and activities is used for clear, unambiguous recording.
- Species-specific recording conventions:
  - Grey heron, rook, sand martin, feral pigeon, gulls, and terns: count or record active nests if nesting; note presence if not nesting.
  - Wood pigeon, swift, swallow, house martin, magpie, jackdaw, carrion crow, house sparrow, starling: censused by nest counts or a combination of nest counts and registrations.
  - Fieldfare, redwing, brambling, and other winter visitors: excluded from recording.
- Coverage should be as even as possible; vary direction and starting point between visits.
- For farmland: traverse major internal hedgerows and complete perimeter; for woodland: stay within 50 m of all parts of the plot each visit; use compass for marked grids; most woodland detections are by sound.
- At season end, separate species maps are created, combining data from all visits to show territory occupancy by species.

## Data recording conventions and data specification
- Data collection variables and formats are defined for ECN sites; data submitted to ECNCCU follow the associated Data Transfer documentation (ECN Dataset formats; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access).
- Core recording conventions:
  - Ten visits per year are recorded to map bird location/behavior and to outline territories.
  - Habitat and bird activity are mapped on a per-visit basis using standard notations.
  - Territory presence is summarized by species after combining visits.
- Key dataset identifiers (first four parameters required for all samples):
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05) – unique ECN site code.
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC) – unique code for each ECN core measurement.
  - Location Code (e.g., 01) – ECN site-specific code for sampling locations.
  - Sampling Date/Time – date/time of sample or data recording (time included when sampling is more frequent than daily).
- Data and reporting units/precision follow CBC protocol specifications (as published by BTO).

## Results, outputs, and recording forms
- The CBC method produces a summary sheet indicating presence of birds and nest counts by species.
- End-of-season maps show the locations of birds by species across visits; territories are analyzed and summarized.
- Recording forms and data products:
  - Standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field recording forms are available from the BTO Census Unit.
  - A field recording form for moorland birds is also available.
  - BTO typically prepares outline maps of the survey area from recorder maps.
- Notes reference:
  - BTO habitat mapping instructions (pp. 174–176), BTO species codes (p. 177), and BTO bird activity mapping symbols (p. 178).
