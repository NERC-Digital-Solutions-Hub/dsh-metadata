# BC Protocol

## Aim
- Record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites using the Common Birds Census (CBC) mapping method.
- Produce year-to-year changes in species densities, relate changes to habitat features, and link site data to regional/national patterns.
- Generate maps and indices of population change for analyses at site and broader levels.

## Spatial scope and plot design
- Plot sizes: farmland ≥40 ha; woodland ≥10 ha (with some ECN sites not meeting minimums possible).
- Edge effects: minimize by reducing edge/area ratio.
- Boundaries: clearly discernible features; marked on a 1:2500 map with internal details; if natural features are insufficient, use a 50 m grid and mark grid positions.

## Habitat mapping
- Record habitat features within the plot and extending 50–100 m beyond the boundaries on a map before the first year.
- Map important habitat changes during the recording year or between years.
- Follow the provided habitat description instructions for consistent mapping (see relevant pages).

## Frequency and timing
- Ten visits per year, between mid-March and late June (adjust northward as needed).
- Visits spaced evenly; weekly visits are ideal; each complete visit lasts 3–4 hours.
- Scheduling: eight morning visits before 0900 BST and two early-season evening visits after 1700.
- Avoid cold, windy, wet days; start early on fine days.

## Bird recording and mapping
- Objective: mark the location and movements of every bird present or flying over during a visit, recording each individual only once.
- Use standard conventions for species and activities; certain species have special counting rules (nest counts, presence notes, etc.).
- Coverage: farmland routes should include hedgerows and the plot perimeter; woodland routes should pass within 50 m of every part of the plot each visit (direction and route vary).
- End-of-season outputs: separate species maps combining data from all visits; analyses yield territories occupied by each species.

## Data standards and recording conventions
- Core data identifiers (first four key parameters):
  - Site Identification Code (unique ECN Site code, e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC; unique per core measurement)
  - Location Code (site-specific code for sampling locations)
  - Sampling Date/time (date and time, with appropriate precision)
- CBC-specific data for Common birds (BC):
  - Ten visits per year; map locations and behaviours per visit; derive territory presence by species.
  - Recording fields per visit include: start/finish times (BST, to 1 min precision), visit code, habitat features, species/nest location, bird activity, weather, area surveyed, and territories by species (counts).
- Data formats and transfer: refer to ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation; datasets follow ECN site, core measurement, and location coding; details available on restricted extranet; ECNCCU contact: ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.

## Output products and forms
- Recording forms:
  - Standard CBC summary sheets and BTO field recording forms (CBC summary sheets typically prepared by BTO from map interpretations).
  - Moorland bird field form available from the Census Unit.
- Maps: CBC outline maps of the survey area prepared by BTO; per-visit map-based recording feeds into end-of-season analyses.
