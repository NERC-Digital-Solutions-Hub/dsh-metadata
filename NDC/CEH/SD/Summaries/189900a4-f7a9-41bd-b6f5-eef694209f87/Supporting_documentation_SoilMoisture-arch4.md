# Soil moisture profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Field measurements of soil moisture profiles were conducted during summers 2013 and 2014, alongside gas flux data (refer to gas flux datasets).
- Measurements covered multiple sites identified by codes, each representing a distinct forest type or landscape feature.

## Measurement setup and procedure
- Instrumentation:
  - PR2 profile probe with 4 sensing elements at depths of 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm.
  - HH2 portable reading meter (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK).
- Field procedure:
  - Access tubes inserted in the soil using an augering kit to minimize disruption of soil structure.
  - Tubes initially placed as deep as thaw depth allowed; deeper insertion as the active layer thickened.
  - At measurement time, the PR2 profile probe was connected to the meter, removed from the protective tube, and inserted into the access tubes.
  - Volumetric soil moisture values (m3 m-3) recorded using the meter’s default calibration.

## Data content and relationships
- Measured variable: volumetric soil moisture (m3 m-3) at depths 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm.
- Timeframe: summers 2013 and 2014.
- Data relationship: values referenced to and may be integrated with gas flux datasets (gas flux data sets).

## Data quality, metadata and governance considerations for data leaders
- Calibration and comparability:
  - Uses default calibration per meter; consider documenting calibration references and potential site-specific adjustments to ensure cross-site comparability.
- Documentation and discoverability:
  - Ensure clear metadata for each site (code, description), depth levels, measurement dates, and instrument used.
  - Link datasets to related gas flux data for integrated analyses.
- Data collection practices:
  - Augering method minimizes soil disturbance; record any limitations or deviations from protocol.
  - Depths used reflect thaw depth dynamics; note any changes in active-layer thickness over time.
- Data stewardship:
  - Capture data lineage, versioning, and updates to reflect any reprocessing or calibration refinements.
  - Consider standardizing metadata to support reuse across networks and by policy colleagues or researchers beyond the immediate study team.
