# Soil moisture profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Dataset documenting soil moisture profiles measured during summers 2013 and 2014, alongside related gas flux datasets.
- Measurements taken at multiple sites in subarctic Canada, using a standardized protocol to obtain volumetric soil moisture (m3 m-3) at multiple depths.
- Site codes and forest/peatland descriptions provided to contextualize the data (facilitating future discovery and reuse).

## Dataset details
- Timeframe: Summers 2013 and 2014.
- Measurements: volumetric soil moisture (m3 m-3) at four depths: 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm.
- Equipment: PR2 profile probe with 4 sensing elements and a portable reading meter HH2 (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK); access tubes inserted in soil using an augering kit to minimize disruption.
- Protocol highlights:
  - Access tubes placed as deep as thaw depth allowed, then deeper as the active layer thickened.
  - PR2 profile probe connected to the HH2 meter, removed from protective tube, and inserted into access tubes during measurement.
  - Values recorded from the meter using the default calibration.
- Associated data: mentions gas flux data sets (referenced as part of the broader data collection).

## Data quality and usage notes
- Measurements rely on the instrument’s default calibration; accuracy depends on calibration and instrument performance.
- Data are temporally constrained to summers 2013 and 2014.
- Sampling used access tubes to minimize soil disturbance; depths were chosen at fixed intervals (10, 20, 30, 40 cm) with adjustments only as thaw depth and active layer conditions allowed.

## Data governance and sharing considerations
- Data should be uploaded to appropriate data portals and catalogued with complete metadata.
- Metadata should document: site code, site description, measurement depths and units, measurement dates, equipment used, calibration method, and measurement protocol.
- The dataset can be linked to the associated gas flux datasets for integrated analyses.
- Consider ongoing data updates or additions (e.g., future measurements or extended time series) and any sharing or embargo policies.
