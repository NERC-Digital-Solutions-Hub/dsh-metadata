# Soil moisture profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Study measuring soil moisture profiles during summers 2013 and 2014, alongside gas flux data sets.
- Covers 10 sites with coded identifiers, spanning unburnt and burnt forests, peatlands, and birch/spruce communities in subarctic Canada.
- Data designed to support environmental monitoring and enable cross-site comparisons within standardised methods.

## Sites (site codes and descriptions)
- FFU — FireFox Unburnt: an unburnt black spruce forest
- FFB — FireFox Burnt: a black spruce forest burnt in 1998
- BLF — BlackFox: a black spruce forest
- WHF — WhiteFox: a white spruce forest
- TPP — Teslin Peatland Plateau: a peatland plateau near Teslin
- MCU — Mosquito Creek Unburnt: an unburnt black spruce forest
- MCB — Mosquito Creek Burnt: a burnt black spruce forest
- WTP — White Truck Plateau: a peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- BCB — Boundary Creek Birch: a birch forest
- BCS — Boundary Creek Spruce: a black spruce forest

## Methods and instrumentation
- Moisture profiling using a PR2 profile probe with four sensing elements at 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm.
- Readings taken with a portable HH2 meter (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK).
- Access tubes installed with an augering kit to minimize soil disturbance; tubes initially placed to thaw depth and extended deeper as the active layer thickened.
- During measurement, the PR2 probe is connected to the meter, removed from its protective tube, and inserted into the access tubes.
- Volumetric soil moisture values (m3 m-3) recorded using the meter’s default calibration.

## Data outputs and integration
- Primary outputs are moisture values at four depths for each site and measurement period.
- Data are situated to complement gas flux datasets, enabling integrated environmental monitoring and standardised reporting across sites.
