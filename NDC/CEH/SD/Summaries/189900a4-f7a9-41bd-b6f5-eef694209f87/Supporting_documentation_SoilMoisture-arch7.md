# Soil moisture profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Soil moisture profiles were measured during summers 2013 and 2014, alongside flux measurements (refer to gas flux data sets).
- Measurements span multiple site types across subarctic Canada, with site codes provided below.

## Site codes and descriptions
- FFU - FireFox Unburnt: an unburnt black spruce forest
- FFB - FireFox Burnt: a black spruce forest burnt in 1998
- BLF - BlackFox: a black spruce forest
- WHF - WhiteFox: a white spruce forest
- TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: a peatland plateau near Teslin
- MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: an unburnt black spruce forest
- MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: a burnt black spruce forest
- WTP - White Truck Plateau: a peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- BCB - Boundary Creek Birch: a birch forest
- BCS - Boundary Creek Spruce: a black spruce forest

## Measurement methodology
- Moisture was measured with a PR2 profile probe (4 sensing elements at 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm) connected to a portable HH2 reading meter (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK).
- Access tubes were inserted using an augering kit to minimize disruption to soil structure.
- Tubes were initially placed as deep as thaw depth allowed and deeper as the active layer thickened.

## Data collection process
- At measurement time, the PR2 probe was connected to the reading meter, removed from the protective tube, and inserted into the access tubes.
- Values of volumetric soil moisture (m3 m-3) were recorded from the meter using the default calibration.

## Temporal scope
- Summers 2013 and 2014.

## Data integration and related datasets
- This dataset is associated with gas flux data sets, allowing integration of soil moisture profiles with flux measurements for spatial analysis and interpretation.
