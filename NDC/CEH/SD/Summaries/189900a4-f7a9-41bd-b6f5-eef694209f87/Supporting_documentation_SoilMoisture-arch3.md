# Soil moisture profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Timeframe: summers 2013 and 2014
- Content: soil moisture profiles alongside flux measurements (refer to gas flux data sets)
- Purpose: provide structured soil moisture data across multiple subarctic sites to support environmental monitoring and analysis

## Sites and environments
- FFU FireFox Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
- FFB FireFox Burnt: black spruce forest burnt in 1998
- BLF BlackFox: black spruce forest
- WHF WhiteFox: white spruce forest
- TPP Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin
- MCU Mosquito Creek Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
- MCB Mosquito Creek Burnt: burnt black spruce forest
- WTP White Truck Plateau: peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- BCB Boundary Creek Birch: birch forest
- BCS Boundary Creek Spruce: black spruce forest

## Measurement methodology
- Instrumentation: PR2 profile probe with 4 sensing elements at 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm; connected to an HH2 portable reading meter
- Deepening technique: access tubes inserted using an augering kit to minimize soil disturbance; initial depth limited by thaw depth, with deeper insertion as active layer thickens
- Procedure: meter connected to PR2, protective tube removed, probe inserted into access tubes; readings taken using default calibration
- Data captured: volumetric soil moisture (m3 m-3)

## Data management and quality considerations
- Calibration: measurements recorded with the default calibration setting
- Metadata implication: method details (sensing depths, depth limitations, tube insertion) provide essential context for data interpretation and cross-site comparability
- Contextual link: soil moisture data are tied to gas flux datasets collected during the same campaigns

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Strengths aligned with monitoring needs:
  - Standardized multi-site protocol enables cross-site comparability
  - Minimal disturbance approach supports repeated measurements over time
  - Clear documentation of instrumentation and depths facilitates reproducibility
- Metadata and governance considerations:
  - Explicit calibration details and comprehensive metadata are important for data sharing, quality assurance, and long-term usability
  - Documentation of thaw depth and active-layer dynamics enhances interpretation of depth-specific moisture readings
- Use in monitoring activities:
  - Provides a robust basis for assessing soil moisture patterns across different forest and peatland ecosystems in subarctic environments
  - Useful in analyses that relate moisture profiles to gas flux measurements and environmental change over time
