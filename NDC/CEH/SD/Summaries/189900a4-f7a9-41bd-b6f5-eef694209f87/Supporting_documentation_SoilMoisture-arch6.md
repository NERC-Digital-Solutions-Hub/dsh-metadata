# Soil moisture profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Dataset describing soil moisture profiles measured during summers of 2013 and 2014 at multiple subarctic Canadian sites.
- Focuses on volumetric soil moisture (m3 m-3) alongside associated gas flux data sets (referenced but not detailed here).
- Sites cover a range of forest types and peatlands, identified by short codes.

## Sites and site codes
- FFU – FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
- FFB – FireFox Burnt (black spruce forest burnt in 1998)
- BLF – BlackFox (black spruce forest)
- WHF – WhiteFox (white spruce forest)
- TPP – Teslin Peatland Plateau (peatland plateau near Teslin)
- MCU – Mosquito Creek Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
- MCB – Mosquito Creek Burnt (burnt black spruce forest)
- WTP – White Truck Plateau (peatland plateau near Yellowknife)
- BCB – Boundary Creek Birch (birch forest)
- BCS – Boundary Creek Spruce (black spruce forest)

## Measurements and depths
- Target variable: volumetric soil moisture (m3 m-3).
- Measurement depths: 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, and 40 cm.

## Equipment and setup
- Soil moisture profiler: PR2 profile probe with 4 sensing elements.
- Data meter: HH2 portable reading meter (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK).
- Access tubes inserted into soil to minimize disturbance; tubes driven as deep as thaw depth allowed, with deeper insertion as active layer thickened.

## Procedure and calibration
- At measurement time, PR2 profile probe connected to HH2 meter, then removed from protective tube and inserted into access tubes.
- Readings recorded from the meter using the default calibration.

## Data products and potential use
- Standardized soil moisture profiles across multiple sites enable cross-site comparisons and trend analyses.
- Potentially integrated with gas flux data for combined hydrological-ecological analyses.
- Outputs suitable for dashboards or reports that summarize moisture profiles by site and depth, and track temporal changes between 2013 and 2014.

## Data quality and notes
- Data rely on default calibration for moisture readings; caution advised when comparing across sites with different soil properties or calibration sensitivities.
- Measurements taken during summers, reflecting seasonal moisture dynamics in subarctic permafrost zones.
