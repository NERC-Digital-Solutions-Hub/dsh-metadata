# Plant_microbe_microcosm_design.csv

- Aim and scope
  - Understand how drought adaptation in Festuca ovina and its root-associated bacteria interact under different moisture environments.
  - Combine plant genotype ancestry (drought- vs control-adapted Buxton material) with microbial inocula (bacterial isolates or soil wash) across moisture treatments in a controlled microcosm setup.
- Experimental design
  - Source materials:
    - Bacterial inocula: a single pooled population of Pseudomonas koreensis.
    - Field-derived soil wash containing an intact soil microbial community.
    - Plant material: surface-sterilised Festuca ovina clones.
    - Soil: sterilised natural rendzina soil.
    - Origins: drought-treated Buxton climate treatment vs control Buxton climate treatment.
  - Factorial structure:
    - Plant climate ancestry: drought-adapted vs control-adapted.
    - Microbial inoculum: bacterial isolates vs soil wash.
    - Moisture environment: drought vs well-watered control.
    - Result: eight main combinations (2 x 2 x 2) plus no-plant controls.
  - Replication and scope:
    - 176 microcosms in total for the main experiment.
    - 32 additional microcosms as no-plant controls (with either bacterial population or soil wash, across moisture treatments).
    - 16 spare microcosms representing each treatment combination.
    - 3 microcosm pots containing sterilised soil only.
  - Timeline: 19 weeks of experiment duration.
- Measurements and data collection
  - Weekly soil respiration measurements using LiCor Li-8100 IRGA and Li-Cor 8150 Multiplexer; soil volumetric water content recorded with ThetaProbe ML2x.
  - Soil respiration and moisture data linked to metadata for merging with other datasets.
  - Additional datasets collected from control-treatment microcosms (February–March 2021) include soil enzyme activities, microbial community physiological profiles, substrate use profiling, lab-based drought resistance assays, plant nutrient supply, and plant growth traits.
- Datasets and data structure
  - Core design file: Plant_microbe_microcosm_design.csv
    - Metadata fields (Table 1): pot_no, potID, Clone full_ID, Festuca ancestry, Inoculation type (Pse, soil wash, NA), Microbial ancestry (C or D), Treatment (D or C), Design (Full, No plant control, Spare, probes), table, row, column.

    - Plant_microbe_microcosm_sup_substrate.csv: substrate addition effects on soil CO2 efflux using MicroResp method; substrate treatments include glucose, ABA, malic acid, L-leucine, and water control.
    - Plant_microbe_microcosm_sup_drought.csv: effects of a lab-imposed drought and subsequent rewetting on CO2 efflux; includes days and MR_Treatment (control/drought) with multiple observation points.
    - Plant_microbe_microcosm_nutrient_supply.csv: nutrient supply rates measured with PRS probes (anions and cations; multiple elements including NO3-N, NH4-N, Ca, Mg, K, P, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, B, S, Pb, Al, Cd, etc.).
    - Plant_microbe_microcosm_plant_size_traits.csv: non-invasive image-based plant size traits over time (canopy area, height, width).
    - Plant_microbe_microcosm_plant_morphology_traits.csv: six morphologic traits measured once (leaf length/width, regrowth, SLA, above-ground biomass, inflorescences).
- Quality control, instrumentation, and methods
  - Randomisation used to ensure valid experimental design.
  - Instrumentation for main respiration measurements: Li-Cor Li-8100 IRGA and Li-Cor 8150 Multiplexer; soil moisture via ThetaProbe ML2x.
  - Enzyme assays: fluorescence-based activity measurements with plate reader; live vs boiled controls for background correction; calibration using standard curves.
  - MicroResp assays: colorimetric detection of CO2 with cresol red in agar; 3 technical replicates per sample-substrate combination; blanks included.
  - No separate calibration steps required beyond standard instrument calibration and plate reader standards; data processing includes normalization and calibration equations described in metadata for each dataset.
- Data integration and usage notes
  - All datasets include pot_no to allow merging with Plant_microbe_microcosm_design.csv and to enable cross-dataset analyses.
  - Datasets capture temporal (weekly) and spatial (microcosm layout: table/row/column) dimensions suitable for mixed-effects modeling.
  - Potential analyses include interactions among plant ancestry, microbial inoculum type, and moisture treatment on soil respiration, enzyme activities, substrate responses, nutrient uptake, and plant growth traits.
