# Bunce Woodland Survey of Great Britain 2020-2022

## Overview
- 97 broadleaved woodlands surveyed across Great Britain from 2020 to 2022.
- Ecological information collected at the site level and in detail from 16 random 200 m2 plots per site.
- Data include plant species composition (canopy and ground flora), soil pH, Loss on ignition (soil organic matter), habitat management, and other plot- and site-level descriptors.
- Repeat of earlier surveys (1971; 2000/2003, referred to as '2001') to enable analyses of ecological change since the 2000-2002 survey.

## Datasets and Data Structure
- WOODLANDS_SURVEY_SITES_2022.csv: approximate locations of surveyed woodlands; site IDs (1-103), site names, Easting/Northing (OSGB36), OS grid references.
- WOODLANDS_SURVEY_SITE_INFORMATION_2022.csv: descriptions of surveyed sites and plots, including habitat and tree descriptions, plot slope and aspect, survey dates; data sheet categorisation (site vs. plot level).
- WOODLANDS_SURVEY_TREE_DATA_2022.csv: tree data by plot, including tree type (Tree/Sapling/Shrub), DBH, species, multi-stem indicators, live/dead status.
- WOODLANDS_SURVEY_GROUND_FLORA_2022.csv: ground flora records for each plot, with species codes/names, cover estimates, growth forms, and plot nesting information.
- WOODLANDS_SURVEY_SOIL_DATA_2022.csv: plot soil analyses (pH, LOI), soil type, date of sampling, and quality-control notes; notes on missing samples.
- Datasets are organized by SITE_NO, SITE_NAME, PLOT_NO, with additional fields for plot-level data (e.g., NEST, BRC numbers, species, growth forms, etc.).

## Methods and Design
- Stratified sampling across each woodland area; field methods follow Bunce & Shaw 1973 standardized procedure.
- Field handbook: National Woodland Survey & Native Pine Survey Field Handbook (Smart & Wood, 2021).
- 16 plots per site (200 m2 each) provide detailed plots-level data alongside site-level descriptors.

## Background and Purpose
- The 2020-2022 survey was initiated to create a repeatable dataset across the same sites previously surveyed in 1971 and during 2000-2003 ('2001').
- Enables examination of ecological change since 2000-02 and supports cross-temporal analyses with earlier publications.
