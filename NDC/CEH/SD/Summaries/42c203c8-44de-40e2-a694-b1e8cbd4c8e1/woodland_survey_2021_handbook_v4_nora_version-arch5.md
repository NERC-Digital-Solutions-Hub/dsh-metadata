# Field Handbook

## Overview
- Purpose: document methods for the GB broadleaved woodland survey, adapting earlier 1971 baseline with updates in 2002 and 2021 amendments.
- Organisational context: UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology Lancaster Environment Centre; aims to update and standardise long-term woodland data for discovery and use.

## What data are collected
- Site-level data
  - Site description and habitats (presence/absence of attributes; comments for interpretation; site-wide context)
  - Site and plot attribute codes and general site metadata (site number, date, recorder, slope, aspect)
- Plot-level data (16 plots per site)
  - Plot details: site name, plot number, recorder initials, date, slope, aspect, photos
  - Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of defined attributes
- Vegetation plot data (ground flora)
  - Four corner-posted 14.14 x 14.14 m plot subdivided into nested 2 x 2 m, 5 x 5 m, 7.07 x 7.07 m, 10 x 10 m, and 14.14 x 14.14 m subplots
  - Ground flora: presence/absence of vascular plants and common bryophytes in each nest; percent cover estimates (nearest 5%) for each species; total plot cover tallied; bryophyte entries restricted to a predefined common list (Appendix I)
  - Note on data handling: avoid double counting bryophytes in Total Bryophyte; partial presence counts acceptable for defined areas
- Trees, saplings, and shrubs
  - Trees: DBH measurements (cm) for stems ≥5 cm within the full plot; multi-stemmed trees handled with dedicated entries; dead trees flagged
  - Saplings: height >130 cm, DBH <5 cm; recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters 1 (NE) and 3 (SW)
  - Shrubs: same spatial constraint as saplings; list includes Hazel, Holly, Hawthorn, etc.
  - Disease: record presence of disease (e.g., Ash Dieback); photograph evidence optional
- Soil sampling
  - 15 cm deep soil core from the plot centre (or as near as possible)
  - Label soils clearly with site and plot identifiers; maintain cold chain for transport to CEH Lancaster
- Disease imagery and photos
  - Photos of disease signs (up to five per plot)
  - Five photos per plot to document canopy and different bearings
- Additional site data and observations
  - Open habitats, rocky features, aquatic/open habitats, human-made features, animals, and subjective overall site impression
  - Comments field for unstructured observations and owner-reported information
- Sample handling and lab protocols
  - Appendix VII outlines soil analysis (pH, LOI) and lab workflow
  - Soil samples shipped to CEH Lancaster or Lancaster University

## Data collection workflow
- Access and permissions
  - Permissions coordinated by XSG Ltd; CEH provides site maps and owner contact details
  - Ensure possession of permission letters, owner contact details, and risk assessments
- Location and sampling design
  - 16 random sampling points per site; locating points as close as possible to original 1971 baselines
  - Use GPS to reach approximate point; use prior DBH data to verify proximity; avoid forcing exact replication if site change is evident
- Recording sequence
  - Ground flora first (to capture undisturbed state)
  - Then trees, saplings, shrubs; photos; and soils sampling
- Electronic data capture and backups
  - Primary method is Survey123 (ArcGIS) with offline GPS capability
  - Paper forms available as backup (Appendix IV)
  - Forms: one site description, one plot description, one soil sample per plot; ground flora and DBH data per nest/quadrat
- Data submission and maintenance
  - Online submission via Send Now; offline options via Drafts/Outbox; auto-save features
  - Site-level and plot-level data are submitted to a central database
  - Central site description form accompanies plot data
- Per-site and per-plot documentation
  - Appendix IV provides detailed attribute definitions and consistent data capture rules
  - Appendix V lists field equipment required for site access and data collection
  - Appendix VII provides laboratory protocols for soil analysis

## Data capture technology and backups
- Survey123 field app
  - Enables GPS-enabled location capture, offline data entry, photo attachments, and central submission
  - Structure: My Surveys, Collect, Drafts, Outbox, Sent, with basemap options and offline functionality
- Backup paper forms
  - Used when devices fail; must be transcribed later into digital form
  - Pencil use recommended for wet conditions; waterproof paper suggested
- Data integrity and provenance
  - Data provenance maintained via site and plot IDs, date, recorder initials, and clear notes
  - Photos and notes enable interpretation and future re-analysis

## Data standards, quality, and governance
- Standardisation
  - Consistent nested plotting approach, species lists, and measurement conventions across sites and plots
  - Use of controlled lists for bryophytes (Appendix I) and defined habitat categories
- Metadata and documentation
  - Site description and habitat forms align with plot-level data; cross-checks ensure consistency between site and plot forms
  - Comments and notes fields capture contextual information and ownership details
- Data quality controls
  - Pre-defined data entry constraints (e.g., 5% cover increments, “present” when below threshold)
  - Caution against data bias during plot relocation; explicit guidance to minimize bias
- Data governance considerations for Data Stewards
  - Clear data lineage: site → plot → nest/quadrat → species observations; linkage to soil samples and images
  - Centralised data storage with versioning via Survey123 workflow; offline backup and paper forms
  - Permissions management: ownership details and permissions tracked; ownership communications recorded
  - Data validation: species lists and habitat codes tied to appendices and data dictionaries
  - Data sharing and reuse: central repository; ability to resend/update records; comments for interpretation
  - Retention and longevity: data described as a long-term dataset intended to persist for ongoing biodiversity monitoring
  - Data quality challenges acknowledged: approximate plot re-location, potential land-use change, and need to account for biases in analysis

## Appendices and resources (data and method supporting materials)
- Appendix I & II: Bryophyte lists (common GB bryophytes) and back-up vegetation plot sheets
- Appendix III: DBH recording backup sheets
- Appendix IV: Site Description and Habitats – detailed attribute definitions and site-wide context
- Appendix V: Field equipment list
- Appendix VII: Soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH, LOI) and sample handling
- Appendix VIII: Survey123 generic notes and usage guidance

## Practical implications for Data Stewards
- Emphasise data standardisation and interoperability across field campaigns and future repeats
- Maintain robust metadata, controlled vocabularies, and clear provenance to support reuse
- Implement governance around permissions, sample handling, and routing to central repositories
- Ensure data validation rules are enforced in digital capture and supported by paper backups
- Plan for long-term data maintenance, including versioning, migrations, and documentation updates
- Capture and preserve ancillary data (photos, owner communications, notes) to support interpretation and re-analysis

## End notes
- The Field Handbook provides a comprehensive, standardized methodology for long-term woodland biodiversity monitoring, with explicit procedures for site access, plot layout, vegetation recording, tree and soil measurements, disease documentation, and data capture through Survey123, complemented by paper backups and extensive appendices for reference and governance.
