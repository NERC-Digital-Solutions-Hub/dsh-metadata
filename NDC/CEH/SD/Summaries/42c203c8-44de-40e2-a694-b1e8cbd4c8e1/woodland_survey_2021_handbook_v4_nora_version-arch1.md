# Field Handbook

## Purpose and origins
- Document of standardized methods for a baseline broadleaved woodland survey in GB, with amendments from 1971 and 2002.
- Aims to re-survey plots to compare soil, understorey vegetation, and tree metrics with earlier data.
- Data capture integrates soil sampling, vegetation recording, and tree measurements to inform ecological understanding and change over time.

## Scope and sampling design
- Surveys cover 16 random sampling points (plots) per site, aligned with historical plot locations.
- Sites are located using site and plot location maps, grid references, and OS map extracts.
- Expect some location error due to historical recording methods; aim is to be as close as possible to prior plot centers.
- Access permissions coordinated by XSG Ltd; landowner engagement and permits are documented and considered prior to survey.

## Data capture approach
- Electronic data collection preferred (Survey123 for ArcGIS); offline GPS recommended; photos and metadata captured alongside data.
- Paper backup forms available for field recording if electronic devices fail.
- Data are designed to be discoverable and reusable, with metadata and documentation (Appendices) to support interpretation.

## Survey workflow and field methods
- Site and plot layout:
  - Each site contains 16 plots (14.14 x 14.14 m, ~200 m2).
  - Plot center located with adjacent corner posts; plots oriented so diagonals align with cardinal bearings.
- Plot data collection sequence:
  - Ground flora first (within nested quadrats) to record in a relatively undisturbed state.
  - Vegetation data collected across five nested quadrats (2 x 2 m; 5 x 5 m; 7.07 x 7.07 m; 10 x 10 m; 14.14 x 14.14 m).
  - Species presence and percent cover estimated for each nest; total cover includes litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water, and bryophytes.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs recorded with DBH measurements across four plot quarters; saplings and shrubs restricted to diagonally opposite quarters 1 (NE) and 3 (SW).
  - Tree disease presence noted with possible photographs; defoliation/leaf browning estimated.
  - Soil sample collected from plot center (15 cm depth) with proper labeling and transport.
- Species and data entry:
  - Use dropdowns, or type to search; "Other" options available for unlisted species.
  - Be mindful of potential duplication or blanks in software entry; verify before finalizing.
  - Bryophyte recording limited to common species listed in Appendix I to avoid misclassification.
- Photography and disease signs:
  - Five canopy photos per plot (center canopy and four cardinal directions) before vegetation recording.
  - Up to five photos of disease signs per plot; disease typing optional, with “Other” as needed.
- Recording forms and site-level data:
  - One Site Description and Habitat Form per site; one Plot Description and Habitat Form per plot.
  - Site-level habitat attributes capture features observed along movement between plots.
  - A separate soil analysis plan accompanies soil sampling.

## Soil sampling and laboratory protocol
- Soil cores: 15 cm depth, collected from plot center (within ~1 m) and labeled with site/plot.
- Debris and surface litter removed before coring; rocks moved if necessary; cores filled flush to surface when completed.
- Soil samples shipped promptly to CEH Lancaster (or equivalent) and stored cold until analysis.
- Soil analysis protocol includes pH measurement and loss on ignition (LOI) for moisture content, following standardized lab procedures (Appendix VII).

## Data management, submission, and quality control
- Data submission:
  - Online: Send Now via Survey123 when online and survey complete.
  - Offline: Save as Drafts or Outbox and submit later; auto-save features protect against data loss.
  - Site-level data (Site Description and Habitats) submitted separately from plot data.
- Consistency checks:
  - Ensure plot attributes align with site attributes; attributes present on plot form should also appear on the site form.
  - Prioritize comprehensive data over speed; check for omissions and logical consistency.
- Data discoverability:
  - Datasets created are intended to be discoverable by uploading with metadata; returns and revision history may be tracked.
- Post-survey steps:
  - After completion, verify all equipment and samples are accounted for; complete data entry and submit promptly to minimize data loss.

## Appendices and data resources
- Appendix I–II: Bryophyte lists and vegetation plot backup sheets.
- Appendix III–IV: DBH backup sheets; Site Description and Habitats forms (with attribute codes and definitions).
- Appendix V: Field equipment lists and per-site logistics (permissions, site maps, contact details).
- Appendix VI: Pictures of tree diseases (e.g., ash dieback) for reference.
- Appendix VII: Soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH, LOI) and detailed processing steps.
- Appendix VIII: Survey123 generic notes for field forms and data capture.
- My Surveys and Survey123 documentation outline data organization, offline/online workflows, drafts/outbox/sent status, and how to manage favorites and offline basemaps.

## Practical considerations for analysts
- The protocol emphasizes standardization across time and sites to enable robust temporal comparisons.
- Acknowledges practical constraints: movement between plots, partial site changes, and permission variability.
- Data quality hinges on accurate location, careful avoidance of bias, careful recording of species and habitats, and faithful documentation of landowner interactions and site changes.
- The combination of ground flora, DBH, and soil data supports correlations and predictive insights about woodland structure, regeneration, disease presence, and soil properties over time.
