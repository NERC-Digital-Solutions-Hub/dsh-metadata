# Field Handbook

## Overview
- Field guide for the 1971 baseline broadleaved woodland survey of Great Britain, with 2002 amendments.
- Objectives: soil sampling; understorey plant composition; DBH (diameter at breast height) of trees, saplings, and shrubs; plot attributes; and site descriptions.
- Data collection spans ground flora, vascular plants, bryophytes, trees, saplings, shrubs, and soil analyses; geared toward creating map-based data products and GIS-ready outputs.
- Electronic recording emphasized (Survey123) with paper backups as needed.

## Aims and Scope for GIS-focused Work
- Produce spatial data products that depict vegetation, soil conditions, and stand structure across woodland sites.
- Integrate multi-resolution datasets (e.g., plot-level, site-level, and in-between areas) for analysis of change over time.
- Ensure data are captured with metadata on location accuracy, sampling dates, and site descriptions to support policy and public-facing visuals.

## Access, Permissions, and Site Logistics
- Permissions coordinated by XSG Ltd; acquisition of landowner consent and any permits or insurance documentation.
- Carry site ownership details, permission letters, and risk assessment information; contact landowners as required.
- Repeated surveys must consider changes in land use (e.g., gardens, motorways) and adjust data collection accordingly.

## Location and Plot Re-location Strategy
- 16 random sampling points per site (X marks on baseline maps); exact re-finding of original points is impractical.
- Use a GPS-based approach to approximate the center of each X as closely as possible; compare current DBH data to guide proximity.
- Accept a measured degree of locational error; avoid bias in plot placement by not ‘chasing’ perfect replication.

## Recording and Data Capture Methods
- Data collection may be electronic (Survey123) or paper-based (backup templates in Appendix IV).
- Ground flora data collected first, then trees/shrubs and soils to minimize disturbance.
- Site and plot forms capture presence/absence of attributes, with comments for interpretation.
- For electronic data, offline GPS, photo capture, and standardized forms are emphasized; data can be submitted to a central database when online.

## Plot Description and Habitats (Site and Plot Levels)
- Site Description and Habitats form summarizes site-wide attributes; Plot Description and Habitats form captures plot-level features.
- Ensure consistency: attributes on plot forms should be represented on site forms; avoid recording contradictory data.

## Vegetation Plot: Ground Flora (14.14 x 14.14 m Plot)
- Layout: four corner posts define the plot; diagonal strings create nested quadrats (Nest 1 to Nest 5) progressing from 2 x 2 m up to 14.14 x 14.14 m.
- Nest 1 to Nest 5: record presence of all vascular plants and common bryophytes (seedlings included) with % cover estimates.
- Coverage rules:
  - Do not include trees/shrubs in nest covers; these are recorded separately on page 4 (Trees, Saplings, Shrubs).
  - Cover estimates to nearest 5%; “present” for <5%.
  - Sum of covers can exceed 100% due to layered understory.
  - Bryophyte recording should be limited to common species ( Appendix I guidance).
- Paper form equivalent uses Q and nest identifiers for species presence and cover.

## Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs
- Trees: stems ≥5 cm DBH; record species and DBH for all stems within the plot; multi-stemmed trees recorded with a dedicated workflow.
- Saplings: height >130 cm and <5 cm DBH; recorded in diagonally opposite quarters 1 (NE) and 3 (SW).
- Shrubs: defined by species; recorded in quarters 1 and 3; Hazel treated as shrub for plotting rules.
- Dead trees, coppicing indicators, and other management signs are documented with specific attributes (e.g., stumps, coppice stools, brashing).

## Soil Sampling
- 15 cm deep soil cores collected from the plot center (or as near as possible within 1 m).
- Each soil bag labeled with site/plot identifiers; double labeling recommended.
- Immediate handling: keep samples cool; dispatch to CEH Lancaster (UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology) promptly.
- Soil notes captured on the plot form.

## Plot Completion and Data Submission
- After data collection and sampling: verify all fields, back up forms, and prepare for submission.
- Data submission options:
  - Online: Send Now to central database (Survey123).
  - Offline: Save as drafts/outbox; resubmit when online.
  - Automatic app-save features protect against data loss.
- An additional site-wide description form accompanies the 16 plots per site.

## Documentation and Appendices (GIS-relevant)
- Appendix IV: Detailed site and plot attribute definitions; reconciles site and plot data.
- Appendix V: Field equipment checklist (mapping, GPS, soil bags, labeling).
- Appendix VII: Soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH, loss on ignition, LOI).
- Appendix Ia and Ib: Lists of common bryophytes for monitoring and standard GB bryophyte references.
- Appendix II, III: Paper backup sheets for vegetation plots and DBH data.
- Appendix VIII: Survey123 generic notes and workflow for field apps.

## Practical Considerations and Data Quality
- Be mindful of land-use changes since 1971; document deviations with notes rather than omitting plots.
- Keep safety and permissions prioritized; location accuracy is important but not perfect reproduction of historic points.
- Data products should accommodate potential biases and include metadata on recording conditions, sampling dates, and site histories.

## GIS-Focused Takeaways for Data Products
- Spatial structure: 16 plots per site; ground flora quadrats nested within 14.14 x 14.14 m plots; per-plot and per-site attributes enable multi-scale mapping.
- Attribute schema: presence/absence, % cover, DBH per stem, plant and bryophyte lists, soil pH, LOI, and habitat types.
- Data integration: link site and plot records to maps for policy briefs, public dashboards, and biodiversity assessments.
- Provenance: maintain detailed metadata (permissions, date, sampler initials, GPS readings) to support reproducibility and audits.
