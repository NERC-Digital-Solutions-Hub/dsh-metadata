# Field Handbook

## Aim and Context
- Provides standardized methods for an amended baseline broadleaved woodland survey in GB (1971 baseline, updated 2002; further adapted 2021).
- Focuses on collecting soil, understorey vegetation, and tree-related data to enable comparison over time and across sites.
- Supports data collection for public reporting and policy-relevant insights, with emphasis on reproducibility and data reuse.

## Data and Methods Overview
- Data types collected per site and plot:
  - Site-level: site description and habitats, approximate extent of woodland features.
  - Plot-level: 16 random sampling points per site; 14.14 x 14.14 m plots (200 m²) with nested subplots (2 x 2 m to 14.14 x 14.14 m).
  - Ground flora: vascular plants and common bryophytes across nested quadrats; percent cover estimates.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: DBH measurements, species, configuration (including multi-stemmed individuals, dead stems).
  - Soil: 15 cm depth core per plot; labeling and storage requirements; soil analysis protocols.
- Data capture tools:
  - Electronic data capture via Survey123 (ArcGIS) with offline capability; paper backup forms detailed in Appendices.
  - GPS-driven location capture with guidance on accuracy and averaging to reduce locational bias.
- Documentation and references:
  - Appendices provide bryophyte lists (Appendix Ia, Ib), plot/back-up sheets, DBH sheets, site/plot attribute lists, field equipment, and soil laboratory protocols.

## Access, Permissions, and Site Location
- Permissions coordinated by XSG Ltd; CEH issues permission letters and site maps.
- Important to carry site access details and permission letters; may require vehicle registration, contact with landowners, and permits or insurance documents.
- Location of sampling points:
  - 16 random points per site; exact re-finding of historic plot centers is impractical.
  - Use original plot maps to derive GPS coordinates; aim to be as close as possible to the historical center points.
  - If DBH and canopy patterns suggest real change, document and proceed; avoid biased relocation due to ease of access.

## Data Recording and Plot Layout
- General workflow:
  - Record site-level information first, then complete 16 plots per site.
  - Ground flora data collected before trees to minimize disturbance.
  - Use the 14.14 x 14.14 m plot with four corner posts; place markers for nested subplots (Nest 1–5).
- Plot description and habitats (page 2 of forms):
  - Capture presence/absence attributes for site-scale features and partial-area occurrences (e.g., glades, ponds) with notes for interpretation.
- Vegetation plot: Ground Flora (page 3):
  - Nested quadrats (Nest 1 to Nest 5) across the 200 m² plot; record presence of all vascular plants and common bryophytes in each nest.
  - Estimate percent cover for each species in each nest (nearest 5%; “present” if <5%).
  - Do not include canopy/tree/shrub cover; record separately on page 4.
  - Bryophyte data limited to common species listed in Appendix I to maintain comparability with past surveys.
  - After all nests, record total cover for the full plot (Nest 1–5 data aggregated); totals can exceed 100% due to layering.
- Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs (page 4):
  - Trees: stems ≥ 5 cm DBH; record species and DBH for all qualifying stems within the plot; multi-stemmed individuals recorded with dedicated protocol.
  - Dead trees/stems: indicate status with a dead flag.
  - Saplings: >130 cm in height but <5 cm DBH; recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3: NE and SW).
  - Shrubs: recorded in quarters 1 and 3; include species like Hazel, Hawthorn, etc.; Hazel treated as shrub for recording purposes.
- Soil sampling (2.4):
  - Collect 15 cm core near plot center; remove surface litter and expose soil; avoid rocks; label bags with site and plot identifiers; keep samples cool and dispatch promptly.
- Completion of the Plot (2.5):
  - Ensure all forms are complete, equipment and samples accounted for, soil hole filled, and site-slots noted.
  - Emphasize thoroughness and consistency over speed; data collection is intended to last over time for long-term analysis.

## Data Submission and Management
- Data submission via Survey123:
  - Online submission using Send Now; offline capability via Drafts/Outbox; auto-save mitigates data loss.
  - If resubmitting, note which version is correct in the notes.
- Site-level data required in addition to plot data:
  - A separate site description and habitat form is completed for the whole site.
- Soil sample dispatch:
  - All 16 soil samples per site are bagged, labeled, and sent to CEH Lancaster or Lancaster University; aim for delivery within a week of collection.

## Recording Forms and Data Quality
- Site and Plot Forms:
  - Site Description and Habitats form (one per site) and Plot Description and Habitats form (one per plot; 16 per site).
  - Cross-checks: ensure logical consistency between site and plot attributes; plot attributes should be present on the site form.
- Recording forms and backup:
  - ESRI Survey123 forms described; paper forms provided as Appendix IV backup.
  - Ground flora data should be captured before trees; canopy and soil sampling follow.
  - Use provided equipment and forms; when in doubt, record and annotate with notes to aid future interpretation.
- Data integrity considerations:
  - Acknowledge potential land-use changes since historic surveys; avoid recording plots on built-over sites (e.g., motorways, railways).
  - Emphasize consistency in taxon naming, avoidance of duplicate or blank entries in digital forms, and careful handling of bryophyte data.

## Appendix and Supporting Materials (Key Resources)
- Appendix Ia and Ib: Lists of common bryophytes for pilot woodland sites and Great Britain, respectively.
- Appendix II: Backup paper sheet for vegetation plot data.
- Appendix III: Backup paper sheet for DBH recording.
- Appendix IV: Site Description and Habitats definitions and data fields (alignment with plot-level forms).
- Appendix V: Field equipment checklist (site permissions, plot gear, soil sampling, and general field gear).
- Appendix VII: Soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH, LOI, sample preparation, and labeling procedures).
- Appendix VIII: Survey123 generic notes and guidance for field surveys.

## Practical Considerations for Data Support and Reuse
- The data produced supports longitudinal analyses (1971 baseline, 2002 repeat, and ongoing surveys) and public-facing outputs.
- Standardized data collection enables cross-site comparisons, trend detection, and data-driven policy or conservation decisions.
- The combination of electronic data capture and paper backups ensures resilience in field conditions and facilitates data validation and quality checks.
- Clear documentation of permissions, sampling logistics, and metadata enhances data provenance and reusability for dashboards, reports, or future re-surveys.
