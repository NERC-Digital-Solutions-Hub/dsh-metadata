# Field Handbook

- Purpose: Establish a repeatable methodology to sample soil, record understorey plant species, measure DBH of trees/shrubs/saplings, and document plot attributes to compare against earlier woodland surveys and inform future decisions.

- Scope and origin: Adapted from 1971 baseline and 2002 amended surveys of GB broadleaved woodland; includes guidance on recording tree diseases, and reproduction of tree-disease imagery.

- Organization: Procedures cover access/permissions, site and plot location, data recording (electronic and paper backups), plot layout and habitat descriptions, ground flora sampling, trees/saplings/shrubs measurements, soil sampling, plot completion, data submission, and appendices with species lists, forms, equipment, and lab protocols.

- Data governance and policy relevance: Emphasizes stakeholder-informed measure selection, data quality assurance, metadata and provenance, openness of underlying data, and appropriate data sharing and governance to support monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation.
