# Field Handbook

## Overview
- Purpose: document environmental condition through standardized monitoring of GB broadleaved woodlands, using soil sampling, understorey/ground flora, and tree metrics to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Scope: repeatable 16-plot surveys per site, with detailed plotting and recording protocols to enable cross-site/time comparisons.
- Data emphasis: verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation; outputs include presence/absence data, species lists, DBH, and habitat attributes; datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.

## Data collection framework
- Core measurements per site: soil sample, understorey plant composition, DBH of trees/shrubs/saplings, and plot attributes (including regeneration).
- Plot structure: 14.14 m x 14.14 m (200 m2) plot with nested ground-flora sampling across four smaller quadrats (2x2 m, 5x5 m, 7.07x7.07 m, 10x10 m, up to 14.14 m diagonal) to capture species and cover data.
- Supplementary data: canopy photos, tree disease signs, and habitat attributes (ground-level and site-level descriptions).

## Access and permissions
- Permissions managed by XSG Ltd; CEH provides site maps and permission letters.
- Documentation to carry: site ownership map, permission letter, risk assessment; contact details for landowners and any access constraints.
- Typical owner requirements: pre-survey contact, vehicle registration info, potential permits, and proof of public liability insurance.

## Location of sampling points
- Sites use 16 random sampling points (1–16) marked on a plot location map.
- Exact re-finding of original X marks is not feasible; aim to reach the rough centre of each point using GPS, prior DBH data, and bearing from previous plots.
- Acceptable to encounter some spatial error; avoid bias by not adjusting location to chase “typical” microhabitats.

## Recording data and data capture
- Electronic data capture: ESRI Survey123 field app (with offline GPS); backup paper forms available via Appendix IV if needed.
- Devices: smartphones, tablets, or Windows tablets; offline GPS preferred for accuracy.
- Data submission: central database via online submission; offline work saved as drafts/outbox; auto-save mitigates data loss.
- Site-wide data: separate site description and habitat form (for the whole site) in addition to plot forms.

## Survey123 workflow
- Site and plot setup: site name, plot number, recorder initials; location captured automatically via GPS; includes slope and aspect.
- Canopy disease: record disease signs (e.g., Ash Dieback) with photos if needed.
- Photography: take five photos per plot (one canopy shot from center, four orientated to cardinal directions).
- Location tools: options for averaging locations, multiple basemaps, and offline/online modes to balance accuracy and usability.
- Form navigation: move between pages with on-screen arrows; final tick submits data.

## Plot layout and data per nest
- Ground flora: within the 14.14 m plot, nest-based sampling starts with the innermost 2x2 m quadrat (Nest 1) and proceeds to additional nests (Nest 2–5) to cover the full plot.
- Species recording: presence data entered per nest; if a species is unlisted, use “Other” and add a free-text name.
- Cover estimates: percentage cover for each species per nest, including litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water, and bryophytes; totals may exceed 100% due to layered vegetation.
- Bryophytes: limited common bryophyte list (Appendix I) to ensure consistency; avoid collecting bryophytes from tree bases or unique microhabitats unless justified.
- Data summary: after all nests, enter total plot cover for each species; bryophyte totals are included in the plot total (note potential double-counting to aid interpretation).

## Vegetation ground flora (2.2)
- Plot setup: Four corner posts define the 14.14 m plot; diagonal strings mark nested quadrats; center post used for nest sampling.
- Nest procedure: record species in each nest, then estimate % cover for each species; include the additional six cover categories.
- Data management: avoid blank or duplicate species; use “Other” with free text as needed.
- Paper backup: equivalent steps on paper forms (Appendix II).

## Trees, saplings and shrubs (2.3)
- Trees: DBH measured for all stems ≥5 cm within the plot; multiple stems on a single tree recorded separately (multi-stemmed option).
- Dead trees: mark with Dead if applicable.
- Saplings: height >130 cm but <5 cm DBH; measured in diagonally opposite quarters 1 (NE) and 3 (SW).
- Shrubs: recorded in quarters 1 and 3; included species list includes Hazel, Holly, Hawthorn, etc.; Hazel treated as a shrub.
- Recording constraints: use quadrant rules to locate individuals; multi-stemmed individuals require specialized data entry.

## Soil sampling
- Sample location: center of each plot (or within 1 m).
- Depth: top 15 cm; remove fresh litter and surface debris; avoid excessive rock, or relocate within 1 m if needed.
- Labeling: bags labeled with site and plot; double labeling recommended to prevent sample mix-ups.
- Handling: bag contents and keep samples cool; dispatch to CEH Lancaster promptly (ideally within a week).

## Completion of the Plot
- Post-survey checks: ensure all forms are complete and consistent; verify site/plot/date entries; confirm soil samples are packed.
- Logistics: collect all equipment and samples; fill in any missing data notes about land-use changes or permission constraints.

## Submitting your data
- Online submission: use “Send Now” when online; you can resend with notes if needed.
- Offline submission: use “Send Later”; surveys saved as Drafts or Outbox until connection is available.
- Central site dataset: one additional site-wide form; overall dataset contributes to long-term monitoring.

## Site Description and Habitats (3.1)
- Site-level recording: capture presence/absence of attributes across plots and site walk-throughs; include comments to aid interpretation.
- Consistency check: ensure plot attributes align with site attributes (plot attributes should be reflected in site form).

## Soil dispatch to CEH Lancaster (4)
- Sample transfer: 16 soil cores per site to CEH Lancaster or Lancaster University; various delivery options (hand delivery, courier, next-day post, CEH pickup).
- Timeliness: aim for samples to arrive within the week; CEH closed on weekends.

## Appendices and equipment (summary)
- Appendix I–II: lists of bryophyte species (common across pilot sites and GB) to standardize recording.
- Appendix III–IV: backup paper sheets and site/plot attribute forms.
- Appendix V: field equipment checklist (including permissions materials, plotting gear, and labeling/packaging supplies).
- Appendix VII: soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH, LOI, and sample handling).
- “My Surveys” and Survey123 guidance: how to download surveys, manage drafts/outbox/sent submissions, and use favorites for reusing prior responses.
- Equipment and safety guidance: general PPE and health & safety considerations.

## Practical considerations for Analysts
- Data consistency and reusability: standardized forms, defined attribute lists, and bryophyte lists to enable cross-site/time comparisons.
- Data quality: explicit instructions on location accuracy, avoidance of bias, proper labeling, and thorough notes for interpretability.
- Data accessibility: emphasis on electronic capture and central database submissions to facilitate data sharing and reuse.
- Adaptability: procedures acknowledge site changes (land-use changes, access constraints) and provide guidance for recording meaningful entries when plots are no longer woodland.
