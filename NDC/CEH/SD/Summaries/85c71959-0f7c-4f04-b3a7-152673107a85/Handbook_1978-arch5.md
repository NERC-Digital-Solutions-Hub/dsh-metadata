# Countryside Survey
1978 Introduction

- Objective and scope
  - Defines guidelines for field surveying to obtain an ecological assessment of each 2-kilometre square sampling unit.
  - Acknowledges variability in real-world conditions and encourages recording significant divergences from the basic methodology.
  - Aims for consistent, comparable data across squares, enabling broader ecological interpretation.

- Survey design and data collection approach
  - Core sampling structure per square:
    - Five randomly located vegetation plots (200 m each).
    - Five randomly located soil pits (centres of the plots).
    - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
    - Broad ecological information and classifications for the entire kilometre square.
  - Data collection sequence emphasizes permissions, objective plot placement, and standardized recording.

- Permissions and field ethics
  - On arrival, obtain land ownership/permission information where possible and document owners.
  - Minimize disturbance; keep visits brief; note any needed official justification.
  - Record landowners' details and boundaries where feasible.

- Plot location, layout, and recording rules
  - Vegetation plots are 200 m in extent and marked using five posts; diagonals oriented to form a square with distinct color-coded strings.
  - Plot centers are chosen by locating the nearest identifiable map feature and navigating by compass; exact placement aims to be objective and random within the square.
  - If plots intersect with features (e.g., hedges, roads, streams), relocate centers away from the feature by a set distance and mark on maps.
  - Five plots per square are fixed; any alterations must be carefully documented.
  - Species data: record vascular plants; bryophytes and lichens are sampled/restricted per Tables 1 and 2; collect specimens for uncertain identifications.

- Plot data collection and habitats
  - Habitat and vegetation data collected per plot include slope and aspect, with attributes recorded on data sheets (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 in the handbook).
  - Vegetation categories cover a wide range (woodland, moorland, grassland, arable, scrub, etc.) with detailed subcategories for woodland structure (hardwood, conifer, mixed, coppice, regeneration, dead trees, glades, hedge composition, etc.).
  - Detailed habitat descriptors aligned to Tansley-style vegetation concepts; all major habitat types should be mapped and described, with notes for difficult categories.

- Soil pit methodology and data
  - Soil pits located at the centre of each 200 m plot within the quadrant containing face number one; alternatives provided if obstructed.
  - Pit orientation arranged so maximum light falls on one end for horizon description.
  - Pit dimensions typically 45-60 cm wide by 1 m long; digging proceeds until reaching a defined horizon (C, Cr, or R) or 75 cm depth.
  - Horizons are described with:
    - Horizon boundaries and thickness
    - Symbol (from horizon symbol sheet)
    - Moisture status, colour, mottling
    - Texture and structure
    - Stones (overall content and dominant size)
    - Roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan
    - Soil group and parent material
    - Additional comments and any notable horizon features
  - Sampling of surface horizons for analysis; guidelines for deeper horizons when present.

- Linear features and mapping
  - Linear plots along hedges, streams, and roads (10 x 1 m) positioned in relation to the feature and the two most widely spaced plots in the square.
  - Mapping and data collection for hedges, fences, walls, and boundary features; ensure permanent features are recorded as accurately as possible.

- Data sheets, codes, and inventories
  - Data sheets (vegetation, soil, lines, boundaries, crops, buildings) with standard codes and symbol sets (referenced in figures and back of book).
  - Horizon symbols, colour codes, texture, structure, and other soil descriptors use predefined coding schemes.
  - Aggregates and species lists provided for bryophytes, lichens, and higher plants; specific identifications guided by field specimens when possible.
  - Bryophyte and lichen identifications followed by a controlled set of species codes (see provided lists).

- Data management, quality control, and documentation
  - After fieldwork, ensure all sheets are completed, clipped together, and checked for completeness and consistency.
  - Documentation of any deviations, relocations, or omissions is essential to ensure data integrity.
  - The back of the handbook contains concise Land Classes and modifications to aid interpretation and future classification.

- Data and metadata considerations for data stewards
  - Rich, multi-layered data model: plot-level vegetation, habitat categories, soil horizons with detailed descriptors, linear features, boundaries, crops, buildings, and animals.
  - Standardized data sheets and coding enable cross-square comparison, cleaning, and later digital integration.
  - Encourages capturing contextual notes and difficulties to support data interpretation and future harmonization.
  - Emphasizes documentation of permissions, ownership, plot alterations, and map sketches to support provenance and governance.

- Practical and logistical considerations
  - Field equipment checklists and project housekeeping (e.g., rucksack contents, poles, soil kits, maps, guides) to ensure consistent data collection.
  - Acknowledges variability in terrain and land classes; suggests simplifying categories when necessary for complex squares, with explicit notes when simplifications are made.
  - Provides example sketches and mapping guidance to aid field data capture and interpretation.

- Challenges and considerations relevant to data governance
  - Heterogeneous data across diverse landscapes and land-use types; potential need for category simplification and metadata to capture such decisions.
  - Locating plots in challenging terrain may introduce variability; require robust documentation of any adjustments.
  - Scale and interoperability: standardized coding and data sheets support later integration into broader datasets and analyses, but alignment with evolving data models is essential.

- End-of-survey procedures
  - Perform a final check to ensure all data sheets are complete and the kilometre-square map is as comprehensive as possible.
  - Prepare consolidated outputs, including notes on land classes and potential modifications useful for interpretation and future comparisons.
