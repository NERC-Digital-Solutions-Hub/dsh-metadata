# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Purpose
  - Document sampling design, measurement methods, statistical analysis approaches, and data governance for the Countryside Survey (CS) soils component in 2007, incorporating power analyses to detect significant change.

- Sampling design
  - Years and coverage: soils sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - Sample frame: 256 squares in 1978/1998; expanded to 591 squares in 2007.
  - Power analyses: conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plotting
  - 5 x-plots per CS square (CS x-plots); x-plots are not replicas due to varying land uses and soil types.
  - Relocation: some plots moved or destroyed; access issues necessitated localization of sampling.
  - Unique identifiers: each location has a repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) linking to a known location; repeats within a square are typically 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot corner.

- Sampling method
  - Depth: soils sampled from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrates).
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot; cores hammered in and extracted.
  - 1978: soil pit sampling for the top 15 cm.
  - Core data: photographs and measurements of core dimensions recorded in 2007 for some cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990: some soil mapping undertaken.
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores carry different measurements (Table 1); samples homogenised before pH and LOI analyses (no horizon-specific chemical analyses).
  - Bulk density: measured in 2007, but not using ISO whole-core method.
  - Data presentation: a comprehensive table (Table 1) lists measurements by core type (e.g., pH, LOI, %C, %N, minerals, metals, Olsen P, moisture, etc.) and the number of samples per plot type; some data released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).

- Statistical analysis and interpretation
  - Consideration of land class structure: analyses may be unweighted (stock/change) or weighted by land classes to yield national estimates.
  - Sampling design: bootstrapping not universally applied; recommend a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within a CS square.
  - Design considerations: CS uses dispersed sampling to optimize regional estimates; spatial structure is not the primary interest, but widespread sampling improves precision and coverage.
  - Guidance for users: consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation; review published CS analyses and the CS website for related outputs.

- Data governance and dissemination
  - Emphasis on data quality, transparency, and appropriate data sharing; metadata quality can be a barrier when assessing suitability for use.
  - Some measurements and data were released publicly only after the Soils Report (November 2009).
