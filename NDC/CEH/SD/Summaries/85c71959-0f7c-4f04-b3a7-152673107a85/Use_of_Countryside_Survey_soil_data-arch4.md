# Sampling design

- Context and scope
  - Soils were sampled in the Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - The same 256 squares were used in 1978 and 1998; 2007 expanded to 591 CS squares.
  - Not all measurements were made on all samples; power analyses determined the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and structure
  - Sampling occurs from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 randomly spaced x-plots.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types.
  - Some plots are relocated over time due to destruction, access issues, or uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating the same location across years.
  - Within a square, samples are taken from approximately 2–3 meters apart around a permanently marked 2m × 2m sampling plot.

- Sampling methodology
  - Soil is collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate sampling).
  - 1998 and 2007: cores hammered into the soil and then extracted.
  - 1978: pits dug with soil collected from the top 15 cm of the profile in the pit side.
  - Some soils prevent full core collection due to stones or shallow depth.
  - In 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were recorded for 2 of the 4 cores.

- Measurements and data structure
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - By 1990: some soil mapping occurred.
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (as detailed in Table 1).
  - Samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements; bulk density was measured in 2007 but not using ISO bulk density methods.
  - A full description of methods and implications is provided in Emmett et al. (2008).
  - In 2007, data were collected across all 591 squares; some measurements (e.g., certain core measurements) were only released after the Soils Report published in Nov 2009.
  - The dataset includes a range of measurements per core type (e.g., pH, %C, %N, Olsen P, metals, moisture, various soil properties, and miscellaneous measurements like core dimensions and photographs).

- Statistical analysis and guidance
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock/change of the population, while including them yields national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; the CS data structure should be considered, and a mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to reflect multiple x-plots per CS square.
  - A dispersed, design-based sampling approach can increase overall precision and regional coverage, especially when regional estimates are required.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and interpretation and to review existing CS publications available on the CS website.
