# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data for public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies specifically to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Locations are confidential to preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Confidentiality safeguards the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Requests for location data are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release circumstances
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, require demonstration that IP/confidentiality standards for the external use are equal or higher than CS data, and processing must often be done by CEH to avoid release.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, linear features) are treated as equally sensitive and released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- In all cases, licensing aims to avoid enabling direct locating or visits to CS squares.

## Specific licensing and usage conditions
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, require secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are granted for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the period.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit grid references have licensing terms similar to six-digit releases but do not require the same high IP confidentiality threshold.
- License terms include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise locations or identify CS squares from the data.

## Roles, responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organisation.
- If approved or denied, CEH follows the UK Act and Regulations, and provides justification for decisions.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications for access and the grounds for decisions.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within capacity; requests from outside CS partners are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult with CEH before committing to use any data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or contractual.
