# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise the public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. The policy covers survey square location data; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- Governance: Decisions on exceptional releases are made by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) on behalf of NERC and CS partners, with CEH issuing licences and managing approvals. Current CS partners include CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, and Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.

## When and how locations can be released

- Access allows users to determine if squares fall within predefined areas (country, county, ITE land class, environmental zone).
- Four-digit grid references (covering 10x10 km squares) can be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only considered in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, requiring legal demonstration that associated data or models have equal or higher confidentiality protections. Spatial data within survey squares are treated with equivalent caution and follow the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

## Conditions of release and use

- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals for the stated purpose.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- Post-licence, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; users should not attempt to deduce precise locations.
- Data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must evidence project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases share a license framework with six-digit releases but do not require the same IP confidentiality level for the underlying data.

## Licensing and handling responsibilities

- CEH issues hardcopy licenses for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, with terms reflecting the confidentiality policy.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorized representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.
- CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support reasonable pre-processing for internal CS partners within moderate demand; requests from other organizations are case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for data support work

- Before committing to use CS location data, consult with CEH to define requirements and determine appropriate data release level.
- Where possible, perform pre-processing analysis within CEH to avoid releasing precise locations.
- Plan for licensing timelines, data security, and destruction obligations as part of any data product or workflow.
- Coordinate with CEH or relevant scientific leads to ensure appropriate use and governance of location data.
