# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Protects representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential to maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest supports confidentiality; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and precision levels
- Location data may indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to identify square areas.
- Six-digit grid references are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing locations; exceptional access requires legal demonstration that associated IP/data carry equal/higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares could indirectly reveal locations and is subject to the same exceptional terms.

## Specific release conditions
- Licensees must: maintain confidentiality, store securely, restrict access to authorised individuals, and use data only for the agreed purpose.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and confirmed destroyed at the end of the licence.
- No data may be shared with third parties in ways that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria; license terms prohibit attempts to derive exact locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, decides on exceptional releases following policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; approvals signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If access is denied, CEH supports decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH strives to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case for external requests.
- Partners and prospective data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data covered by the policy (may involve collaboration or paid support).

## Practical guidance for Data Stewards
- Ensure governance aligns with confidentiality and licensing terms.
- Manage secure storage and controlled access; monitor licence periods and destruction of data.
- Document and track all license approvals, terms, and usage restrictions.
- Facilitate pre-processing analyses where feasible to minimize need for releasing precise locations.
- Coordinate with CEH for approvals, exceptions, and potential collaborations.
