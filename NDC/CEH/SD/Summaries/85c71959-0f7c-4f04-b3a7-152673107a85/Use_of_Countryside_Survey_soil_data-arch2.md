# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols.

## Overview
- Documents the sampling design, locations, sampling methods, measurements, and statistical considerations for CS soils across years (1978, 1998, 2007) with power analyses to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sampling design
- 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to sample all 591 CS squares.
- Power analyses were performed to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change.
- Within each CS square, 5 x-plots are randomly spaced; x-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types.

## Sample location
- Soils are sampled from the CS x-plots; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) referring to square, repeat plot, and a consistent sampling site.
- Over time, x-plots may be relocated if plots are destroyed, access is denied, or location certainty is lacking; sampling locations in general are 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

## Sampling
- Soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples); 1998/2007 used soil cores hammered into the soil, then extracted; 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm.
- Some soils could not provide a full core due to stones or shallow soils; core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were made in 2007 for select cores.

## Measurements
- 1978: laboratory measurements were limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1990: some soil mapping was conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements across cores (Table 1); no chemical analyses by soil horizon—samples are homogenised before pH and LOI.
- In 2007, bulk density was measured (not using ISO bulk density methodology); core dimensions and other core-related data were collected.
- Data tables include measurements such as pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, depth of organic layer, texture-related data, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and various core-specific measurements. Some data are restricted and released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).

## Statistical analysis
- Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock and change of the population, while incorporating land classes provides weighted national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not always used; CS analysis should consider the spatial structure, with a mixed model (square as a random factor) to account for multiple x-plots within a square.
- CS adopts a design-based approach: a dispersed set of observations improves overall precision and regional coverage when regional estimates are required.
- Users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and to review published CS outputs available on the CS website.

## Data and outputs
- The full dataset includes measurements across all 591 squares in 2007, with varying numbers of measurements per square and per x-plot.
- Some measurements were originally collected for the 256-square set and later extended to the full 591-squares framework.
- Documentation and methodological details (e.g., Emmett et al. 2008) provide full protocols for data collection and analysis.

## Challenges and data value
- Key challenges include increasing the value of CS soils datasets by integrating them with other relevant data sources and ensuring access to the underlying data used to produce final outputs.
- Emphasis on standardized methods, data verification, and clear data storage/upload practices to portals.
