# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose, scope and partners
- Aim: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Scope: policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Natural England (NE), Welsh Government (WG), The Scottish Government (SG), Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), Forestry Commission (FC), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public-interest stance; requests for location data handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release framework
- Approximate location access: four-digit grid references can be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
- Precise location access: six-digit grid references require exceptional justification; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing precise locations; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases, external release under licence may be allowed if IP confidentiality criteria are met.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality risk and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit locations.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to legitimately required personnel.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed or confirmed secure at licence end.
- No data or derived outputs should compromise square locations or be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have licenses with less stringent IP restrictions than six-digit releases; users must not attempt to derive precise locations from the data.
- Any third-party release or misuse must be avoided; consult CEH if in doubt.

## Roles, governance and practice
- Decisions on exceptional releases are made by CEH on behalf of NERC; CEH issues hardcopy licences with agreed terms.
- CEH provides annual reporting to CS partners on licensing applications and decisions.
- CEH may offer pre-processing analysis support within reasonable timeframes; requests from non-partner organizations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy to define requirements and ensure appropriate use; collaboration or payment arrangements may apply.
