# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- The policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares, while all other Countryside Survey (CS) data remain publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Requests for information handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Data access can indicate whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence for approximate location.
- Precise six-digit grid references require CEH preprocessing to avoid release; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may external provision occur under licence.
- Spatial data within squares (habitats, linear features) could reveal square locations and are treated under the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licensing period.
- Post-project, licensees must confirm destruction of data.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases are similar to six-digit releases but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality; a clause prevents attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Licence governance and responsibilities
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If a release is denied, CEH follows the UK Act and Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH will, subject to moderate demand, support internal CS partner use with preprocessing within a reasonable timeframe; other organisations’ requests are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to using data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid and is negotiated case-by-case.
