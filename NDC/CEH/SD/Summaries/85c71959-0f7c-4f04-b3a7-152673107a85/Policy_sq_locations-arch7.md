# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Sets the rules for access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- All other CS data remains publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protects representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
- Confidentiality supports public-interest goals; requests are handled by CEH under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations can be released
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing a survey square.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references may be released under licence only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances after CEH processes; external use must show IP/data confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality to location data and follow the same exceptional-release terms.
- For situations where pre-processing analysis can meet external needs without releasing precise locations, CEH should perform that analysis if possible.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to designated individuals.
- Licences are finite in duration and project-specific; data must be destroyed and confirmed destruction at licence end.
- No data or derived information may be shared with third parties that could compromise square locations.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate equivalent project-management standards to JCOP.
- For four-digit releases, uses may not aim to derive precise square locations; a clause prohibits attempts to identify exact squares from the data.
- Four-digit and spatial data releases have similar but less restrictive IP requirements than six-digit releases.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences; signatories must be authorized representatives of the licensee.
- If release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using CS location data to help define requirements and appropriate use; collaboration or payment arrangements are negotiated case-by-case.
