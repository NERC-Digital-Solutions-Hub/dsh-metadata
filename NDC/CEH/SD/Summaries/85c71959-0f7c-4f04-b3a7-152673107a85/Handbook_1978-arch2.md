# Countryside Survey 1978 Introduction

- Purpose and approach
  - Defines guidelines for field surveys; acknowledges broad variability and records significant deviations.
  - Aims for consistent ecological assessment of a 2 kilometre square sampling unit.
  - Uses randomized, standardized sampling within each square (plots, pits, linear features) to compare environmental health and policy performance over time.

- Survey design and components
  - Within each kilometre square:
    - Five randomly located 200 m vegetation plots.
    - Five randomly located soil pits at the center of each plot.
    - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
    - Broad ecological information gathered from the entire square.
  - Includes keys to information (e.g., CowS and sheep) to be readily available.

- Permissions and field conduct
  - On arrival, secure owner permission and document ownership details when possible.
  - Emphasizes short visits with minimal disturbance.
  - Notes that boundary/land management details (e.g., bealands) may be used for soil pits; owners’ names and land details recorded on data sheets.

- Plot location and marking
  - Vegetation plot located by five posts forming the square’s diagonal; orientation marked with colored strings.
  - Plot center located objectively by navigation from a map reference; use a compass and pacing rules (special cases for steep terrain or ambiguous features).
  - Avoid placing plots on linear features; relocate if necessary and mark changes on maps.
  - Five random plots are marked on maps; alterations require careful updating.
  - If a plot lies on a risk to people or property, it must be rejected.

- Vegetation data collection
  - Record all vascular plants; bryophytes and lichens are recorded with restrictions.
  - Provide a species list and estimate cover within 5% categories; ensure consistency to avoid bias.
  - For crops within plots, record edge species; if crop is present, data collection may be limited to edge species.

- Plot habitat description
  - Measure slope and aspect from longest line across the square; accommodate difficult terrain by using poles and sight lines.
  - Record habitat attributes within 50 m of the plot; note interpretation issues with a Comments section.
  - Data sheets guide classification of vegetation types and habitats (e.g., woodland, grassland, arable, moorland, etc.).

- Vegetation and habitat classifications
  - Detailed categories for vegetation, woodland structure, agriculture/land use, boundaries, ground features, and habitats.
  - Includes guidance on how to classify hedges, roads, fences, banks, walls, and boundary features.
  - Provides example descriptors and coding schemes for consistent categorization across squares.

- Soil pit methodology
  - Soil pits located at the center of the quadrat; orientation chosen to maximize light on horizon description.
  - Typical pit size: about 45–60 cm wide, ~1 m long; horizons identified and boundaries marked.
  - Dig depth until reaching a specified horizon (C, Cr, or R) or 75 cm, whichever comes first.
  - Horizons described by horizon symbol, thickness, color, moisture, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, soil group, parent material, and any notable features.
  - Sampling includes a surface horizon sample and, if needed, underlying horizons; contamination avoided.

- Data sheets and horizon coding
  - Data sheets collect horizon data with fields for stratigraphy, moisture, color, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, soil group, parent material, and comments.
  - Includes guidance on sampling depth and horizon boundary determination.
  - Completion checks and notes for difficult interpretations.

- Linear features data collection
  - Linear plots (two per feature) are 10 x 1 m and completed from hedges, streams, and roads, following same species identification rules as large quadrats.
  - Plots are located directly on the feature and mapped in their appropriate positions.

- Boundaries and hedges
  - Detailed categories for walls, fences, hedges, bank and ditch boundaries.
  - Recording includes stockproof status, dereliction, and management history (e.g., hedge removal, hedge gaps).
  - Hedgerow species recorded (woody plants only) with principal species composition estimated.

- Crops, buildings, and habitats
  - Crops and horticultural features documented; farmer comments encouraged.
  - Habitats, buildings, and domestic animals documented with appropriate classifications (vernacular vs. non-vernacular, active use, age, and alterations).

- Sketch map and site notes
  - All crops mapped; farmer input sought to identify crops and land features.
  - Sketch maps should capture woodlands, hedgerows, field boundaries, and notable features without over-cluttering.
  - Additional notes to provide a clear overall picture of square characteristics.

- Domestic animals and farms
  - Breed identification methods provided; simple keys and farmer input recommended when possible.
  - Practice and breed sheets intended to build a catalog over time; cross-square comparisons possible.

- Bryophytes and lichens
  - Appendices include lists of bryophyte and lichen species to identify; guidance emphasizes careful selection when uncertain.

- Land classes and landscape variation
  - Land classes (Illustrative categories 1–24) describe varied landscapes (central/southern, southeast, plains, wolds, uplands, coastal scenarios, etc.).
  - Provides qualitative criteria for mapping landscape context and potential land-use patterns across squares.

- Data goals and use
  - Emphasizes standardized, repeatable data collection to enable environmental health assessment and policy evaluation over time.
  - Encourages combining datasets and ensuring underlying data availability to maximize value and accessibility.
