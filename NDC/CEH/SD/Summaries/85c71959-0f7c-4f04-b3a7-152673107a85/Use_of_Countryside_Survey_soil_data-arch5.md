# Sampling design

- Study scope and timeline
  - Soils sampled in CS in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - Same 256 squares sampled in 1978 and 1998; 2007 expanded to 591 CS squares.
  - Not all measurements were made on all samples; power analyses used to determine sample sizes (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Sampling from CS x-plots; five x-plots per CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to land-use and soil-type heterogeneity.
  - Some plots relocated over time due to destruction, access restrictions, or uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Repeat plots refer to the same location; actual sampling points are about 2–3 m from the original corners of a 2 m × 2 m plot.

- Sampling method
  - Top 15 cm of soil sampled (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998/2007 used soil cores hammered into the soil; 1978 used a soil pit.
  - Full core collection sometimes impeded by stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and core-dimension measurements were taken in 2007 for some cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (Table 1).
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not via ISO whole-core method); full implications described in Emmett et al. 2008.

- Measurements-by-year and data coverage
  - Variables recorded include: LOI, pH (water & CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photograph, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals.
  - Data availability varies by square/x-plot:
    - All 591 squares: LOI, pH, core-related measurements (where applicable), etc.
    - Original 256 squares: %C, %N, Olsen P, metals (limited to certain x-plots).
    - Some measurements available for only a subset of x-plots within squares (e.g., 2 of the 5 x-plots for certain analyses).

- Data quality, analysis guidance, and caveats
  - Statistical analyses should account for land-class structure; without this, estimates reflect population stock/change rather than national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; recommended use of a mixed model with square as a random factor to reflect multiple x-plots per square.
  - CS design favors a dispersed set of observations for regional estimates; spatial structure is not the primary interest.
  - Users should consult CEH prior to analysis and check published CS data uses listed on the CS website.

- Data governance and release notes
  - Some data were released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.
  - Documentation and methodological details are anchored by Emmett et al. (2008).
