# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the Countryside Survey field sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification from 1978 through 2007.
- Emphasizes the need for a representative, stratified sampling design linked to an environmental land-classification system.
- Tracks how sampling decisions support national, and later country-specific, habitat estimates.

## The Importance of Stratification
- Pure random sampling can yield unrepresentative extremes; stratification ensures all parts of the population (land types) are represented.
- ITE Land Classification creates strata by combining environmental factors (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to capture ecological variation across Britain.
- Stratified, random sampling reduces bias and improves the reliability of national and regional estimates.

## The ITE Land Classification: Origins and Evolution
- Rooted in mid-1970s work (Lake District) using environmental attributes to group large-scale land areas; initial approach used a 1 km square sampling unit.
- Early classification process:
  - Center square approach within a 15x15 km grid identified 1228 squares; surrounding squares also classified, yielding 6039 km squares for analysis.
  - 32 Land Classes described by average environmental characteristics.
- Early sampling framework (CS1978) used 8 samples per class (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas.

## Sampling Framework and Field Surveys

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification and 1 km Squares
- ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to form 32 land classes from environmental data.
- Core sampling: eight 1 km squares per class (256 total) surveyed.
- National habitat estimates calculated as mean habitat area per square in each class times the class area.

### 1984 – Second Field Survey
- Expanded to 12 squares per land class (384 total) to improve precision.
- Results published with reference to the 1978 framework.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (& 3rd Field Survey)
- Land Classification revised to classify every 1 km square in GB (more comprehensive but with some square reclassification).
- 508 squares surveyed; included repeat of 1978 quadrats and soils data; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.

### 2000 – Developments of the ITE Land Classification
- Recognized need to maintain national estimates while enabling regional and local estimations.
- Land Classification extended to cover every square; some replacements/adjustments led to 62% direct correspondence with the earlier classification.
- Separate country estimates introduced, necessitating:
  - Sub-division of land classes into country-specific variants.
  - Aggregation of under-represented classes within each country.
  - Additional squares to ensure adequate representation for new classes.
- 40 strata concept (expanded from 32) with representation across England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man.

### 2007 – Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2007
- Growing demand for Wales-only reporting post-devolution required Wales-specific refinements.
- Welsh sub-classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and total strata increased to 45.
- Wales received 43 additional squares; English adjustments ensured comparable precision.
- Wales-Wide improvements included targeted upland sampling adjustments; English classes 5e and 15e retained fewer squares due to precision considerations.
- Final CS2007 sampling framework mapped for England, Wales, and Scotland with country-unit reporting in mind.

## Separate Country Estimates
- CS1990 and CS2000 frameworks allowed estimates to be reported by country units (England with Wales, and Scotland; later Wales-specific reporting).
- Changes included class sub-division by country units, aggregation to maintain adequate sample sizes, and additional squares to balance representation across countries.
- In 2007, Wales received enhanced sampling to support Wales-only reporting; England adjustments preserved overall precision.

## Upland Habitats Module (CS2000)
- Added 30 upland squares in England and Wales to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates.
- This module targeted under-sampled high-altitude and marginal uplands to strengthen country-specific estimates.

## Summary and Considerations for National Estimates
- The sampling strategy has consistently tied field sampling to the evolving ITE Land Classification to ensure stratified, representative coverage.
- National estimates are derived by combining class-level averages with class areas; country-unit estimates require careful sub-division and reallocation of samples.
- The 2006 note emphasizes that changing land classifications affects cross-survey comparability; consistency decisions balance national comparability with country-specific reporting needs.
- The document traces a clear progression from a tightly controlled, homogeneous GB framework toward a more flexible, country-aware framework capable of Wales and Scotland (and Wales upland modules) reporting.

## Beginning, Middle, and End Highlights
- Beginning: Establishment of a stratified sampling framework using the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative national ecological surveys.
- Middle: Iterative revisions (1984, 1990, 2000) to incorporate full GB coverage, country-specific reporting, and improved data handling; expansion of land classes and sampling intensity where needed.
- End: 2007 enhancements to Wales-specific reporting and upland sampling, with a refined framework that supports country-unit estimates while maintaining comparability across surveys.
