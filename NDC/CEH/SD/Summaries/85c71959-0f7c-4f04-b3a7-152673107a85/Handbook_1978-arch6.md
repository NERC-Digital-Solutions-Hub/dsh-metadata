# Countryside Survey
1978

## Overview
- Purpose: Define guidelines for a field survey to obtain a consistent ecological assessment for a 2-kilometre square sampling unit.
- Approach: Flexible methodology to accommodate wide-ranging conditions; deviations from basic method documented.
- Scope of data: Vegetation plots, soil pits, linear plots along streams/roads/hedgerows, broad square-level ecological information, and keys to information (e.g., cow/sheep data) collected in one place.

## Survey Design and Data Collection

- Plot structure
  - Five randomly located vegetation plots (approx. 200 m each).
  - Five randomly located soil pits in the centers of the plots.
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information for the whole kilometre square.
- Permissions and logistics
  - Obtain ownership information and permissions on arrival; minimal disturbance.
  - Record ownership details and crop boundaries when relevant.
- Plot location and marking
  - Plots located randomly; position judged against map features and navigated with a compass.
  - Center point determined by the final stride; relocate if blocked by features (e.g., gardens, fences) following predefined rules.
  - Plots marked on maps to avoid linear features; relocate if pacing would intersect features.
  - Five random plots per square marked on maps; alterations logged.
- Data types and outputs
  - Vegetation data: species lists with progressive recording from inner quadrat; target to identify principal species.
  - Cover estimates: reported within 5% categories; avoid over- or underestimation via constant checks.
  - Special cases: edge species when plots fall within cropped fields; crop-edge sampling described.
  - Additional data: coarse habitat description and broad ecological information for the entire square; summary keys for downstream use.

## Field Procedures

- Plot Description and Habitats
  - Measure slope (highest to lowest point) and orientation (aspect); procedure accommodates difficult terrain.
  - Record attributes within the plot and within 50 m; use notes for interpretive challenges.
  - Data sheet structure (including slope, aspect, and self-explanatory attribute categories) documented on Fig. 4.
- Vegetation Data
  - Categories include broad vegetation types (e.g., woodland, grassland, moorland, arable, scrub, hedgerows, etc.) with subcategories for woodland structure (hardwood, conifer, mixed, coppice, regeneration, dead trees, glades, etc.).
  - Agriculture and crops: meadows, pastures, cereals, root crops, horticulture, farm buildings, enclosures, gardens, orchards, recreation areas, drainage, and domestic rubbish.
  - Boundaries and ground features: roads, tracks, fences, hedges (stockproof status), walls, ditches, cliffs, rocks, rivers, ponds, lakes, peat, drainage features, and standing water.
  - Animals and habitats: domestic animals (sheep, cattle, horses, pigs, chickens), wild species presence, and general habitat classifications for birds and other fauna.
- Soil Pit Procedure
  - Pit placed at plot center (as close as possible to a fixed reference face); if obstructed, reposition with documented justification.
  - Pit dimensions typically 45–60 cm wide and about 1 m long; dug until a horizon (B/C) or 75 cm depth, whichever occurs first.
  - Horizons identified and boundaries marked with markers; descriptive data collected on horizons (color, moisture, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, etc.).
  - Horizon symbols referenced to a horizon symbol sheet; moisture status and color codes recorded; textures and other properties described using standardized codes.
  - Sampling
    - Surface horizon sample collected if thickness allows; otherwise sample from underlying horizons as appropriate.
- Linear Features
  - Two plots per feature (hedges, streams, roads) located in line from the two most widely spaced plots in the square.
  - Use a 1 m stick to trace along feature, adapting to curves; include only features with permanent water or lasting presence (e.g., ditches included).
  - Species identification follows the same rules as in the large quadrat; principal species within hedges recorded with woody species composition noted.
- Sketch Maps and Boundaries
  - Sketch map to record crops, hedgerows, field boundaries, and other features; paste names directly onto photocopy; add notes to aid future interpretation.
  - Boundaries, walls, fences: direct mapping where feasible; otherwise provide overall estimates with cross-checks.
- Documentation and Checklists
  - Data sheets (vegetation, soils, habitats, boundaries) compiled; results checked for completeness before finalising the kilometre square sheet.
  - Back of the Handbook includes brief summaries of Land Classes and potential modifications.

## Data Documentation and Coding

- Data sheets and coding
  - Data sheets provided for recording stratum, horizon thickness, color, moisture, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, soil group, parent material, and additional comments.
  - Horizon data coded with symbols from a Horizon Symbols sheet; colour and moisture codes standardized.
  - Aggregates and species identification guided by coding lists; use indicator species where identifiable; uncertain identifications noted.
- Species and aggregates
  - Indicator species coding lists guide data entry; guidance covers bryophytes, lichens, and vascular plants with example codes (e.g., Arctium, Betula, Callitrich, etc.).
  - Specific lists for bryophytes and lichens included, with designated taxa to identify or exclude if uncertain.
- Land Classes and Habitat Typology
  - Land Classes described to contextualise landscapes (various broadly described classes such as Central South, Southeast Downs, Plainging, Wolds, etc.); the full range of classes provides landscape context for the square data.

## Data Quality, Handling and Post-Field Processing

- Data quality and consistency
  - Emphasis on understanding the “ask,” data sufficiency, and verification with topic experts as needed.
  - Regular checks to prevent systematic biases (e.g., over- or under-estimation of cover).
  - Clear note-taking for difficult categories and inclusion of comments to preserve interpretive context.
- Handling deviations
  - If field conditions require deviations from established methods, document the reason and record the deviations.
- Post-field processing
  - Ensure all sheets are complete and clipped together; reconcile data across sheets and maps; verify that no information is missing from the kilometre square data set.
  - Refer to Land Classes summaries for final contextual interpretation and potential modifications.

## Outputs, Tools, and Practical Considerations

- Primary outputs
  - Complete kilometre square data package including vegetation plots, soil pits, linear features, and habitat descriptions.
  - Sketch maps, boundary maps, and accompanying notes to convey spatial context.
- Tools and equipment
  - Standard field kit: rucksack, survey poles, plastic bags with samples, compass, 1 m sticks, trowels, knives, spades, plastic sheeting for pits, and data sheets.
  - Checklists and project forms to ensure consistency and completeness.

## Endnotes and Additional References

- The handbook provides an appendix with Land Classes, a Glossary of categories, and summarized instructions to aid interpretation and cross-square comparisons.
- Emphasis on practical field experience to refine plotting, sampling, and data capture across diverse landscapes.
