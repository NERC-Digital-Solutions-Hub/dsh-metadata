# Countryside Survey 1978 Introduction

## Purpose and scope
- Defines guidelines for a field survey to obtain an ecological assessment of a 2 kilometre square sampling unit.
- Methodology is flexible to accommodate diverse circumstances; deviations should be documented.
- Objective: produce consistent, comparable ecological data across squares.
- Data collection focuses on four primary components per square:
  - Randomly located 200 m vegetation plots (5 plots per square).
  - Five random soil pits (centred within plots).
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information for the entire kilometre square.
- Includes keys and reference information for species (e.g., cows, sheep) to be available in one place.

## Permissions and planning
- Upon arrival, obtain landowner permissions; pre-arrange ownership information where possible.
- Emphasizes brief visits with minimal disturbance; use brief, informative handouts when beneficial.
- Surveyors are responsible for information requests; notes about land use (e.g., cultivated belts) may influence soil pit placement.
- Record owner names and land ownership details on the end of square data sheets.

## Plot location and marking
- Vegetation plot: 200 m square, located using five posts forming the diagonal; diagonals oriented at right angles.
- Use color-coded strings to mark plot positions; record species progressively from inner quadrat outward.
- Plot positioning is objective and typically determined by locating the nearest map reference and navigating by compass.
- In open terrain, use approximate positioning when unambiguous features are lacking; avoid over-precise plotting since plots are random samples within the square.
- Mark plots on maps, avoiding linear features; relocate if pacing would place the plot on a road, garden, or dangerous area.
- Five randomized plots per square are fixed on the maps; any changes must be carefully documented.
- Species data recorded from the plot with a predefined list; all vascular plants and a restricted set of bryophytes and lichens; exotic or problematic identifications are collected for later determination.

## Vegetation data and sampling rules
- Record all vascular plants; bryophytes and lichens are recorded to a restricted list.
- Species with identification problems should be collected; mosses/lichens on rocks/trees are noted as such.
- Cover estimates are categorized within 5% increments; aim to capture key species and avoid over- or under-estimation.
- If plots fall within crops, record edge species from hedgerows or tracks; crop vegetation sampling is allowed but may be challenging.

## Plot description and habitats
- First habitat data step is to measure slope (highest to lowest point) and aspect along the same line; note difficulties for interpretation.
- Data sheet (Fig. 4) captures a wide range of attributes; notes should be added for difficult categories.
- Category definitions (vegetation and habitat) cover a broad spectrum (woodland, moorland, grassland, arable, hedgerows, etc.) with hierarchies and sub-classes for woodland, agriculture, boundaries, ground features, and habitat types.
- Sketch map notes: record woodland type, hedgerows/field boundaries, and other features; provide detailed but uncluttered cartographic notes to aid later interpretation.

## Soil pit methodology
- Soil pit located at the centre of the quadrat, or positioned at the nearest unblocked point if the centre is obstructed (rock, wall, hedge, road); record any movements and reasons in the soil data sheet.
- If all sites are obstructed, a soil pit may not be dug (record as such).
- Pit orientation places the maximum light on one end face; typical pit dimensions approximately 45–60 cm wide and about 1 m long; remove turf to one side and cover with a plastic sheet to sample horizons.
- Dig until reaching a C, Cr, or R horizon, or a depth of 75 cm, whichever comes first; horizons are identified by color, texture, stoniness, root content, organic matter, compaction, or cementation.
- Horizons are marked with matchsticks or stones; additional notes provided for interpretation.

## Soil data sheet and horizon data
- Data fields include:
  - Stratum and number (per plot), horizon thickness, horizon symbol, moisture status, color, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, and comments.
- Horizon descriptions rely on standard color charts and code lists; sand/silt/clay textures are categorized with numeric codes.
- Sampling: collect a small surface sample (about 200 g) from the top horizon; if the top horizon is thin, sample the underlying horizon; follow rules based on horizon thickness.
- Document any horizon boundaries and irregularities; provide notes for horizons that are difficult to classify.

## Linear features
- Linear plots along hedges, streams, and roads are not plotted on maps; field observers site plots based on observations.
- Linear plots are 10 m by 1 m and completed from each feature; positioned in relation to the two most widely spaced plots in the square.
- Hedges: sample along the hedge, road edge, or stream edge; only include features with permanent water or drainage; use a 1 m transect along the feature.
- Species identification for linear plots follows same rules as the large quadrats; principal species are recorded with hedgerow woody species noted in brackets.

## Kilometre Square data and mapping
- Data collection aims for a balanced approach; where possible, complete square-wide data; if not feasible, ensure that essential information is captured with notes to aid later cleaning and interpretation.
- Boundaries: record walls, fences, hedges, and related structures; categorize material, age, and condition (e.g., old dry/lichen moss, mortared walls, hedgerow types, gate styles, etc.).
- Hedges: detailed hedgerow classifications with species composition estimates.
- Woods: records of woodland types, shelter belts, and related features; roadsides and trees are categorized.
- Buildings and habitats: document vernacular vs non-vernacular buildings, farm buildings, industrial sites, and other features; include notes on architecture and scale.
- Crops and agriculture: document crops, horticultural features, and related landscape context.

## Sketch map, domestic animals, and habitats
- Sketch maps should record crops, hedgerows, field boundaries, and key landscape features; write farm names and crop varieties directly on the map copy for clarity.
- Domestic animals require farmer input or field-identified breeds using provided keys; practice and cross-square references help with breed identification.
- Habitats (rock, aquatic, shoreline, and other) are categorized and summarized on the map; emphasis on dominant vegetation and landscape context.

## Buildings and other features
- Document domestic buildings (vernacular and non-vernacular), farm buildings, industry-related buildings, and other man-made features (rubbish heaps, pylons, etc.).
- Note vernacular vs non-vernacular architecture and the use of local materials where relevant.
- Include miscellaneous elements observed on the landscape (e.g., livestock handling features, drainage patterns, and transport infrastructure).

## Conclusions and quality control
- After fieldwork, verify that all sheets are complete; ensure data cleanliness and consistency.
- Review the kilometre square sheet map to confirm comprehensiveness and consistency with the field data.
- The back of the handbook contains concise summaries of land classes and suggested modifications for future surveys.

## Equipment and project checklist (summary)
- Typical field gear and data collection tools (e.g., rucksack, poles, survey sheets, compass, spade, trowel, knife, ruler, Munsell color charts, horizon sheets, bark/plant keys, and breed reference materials).
- Reference forms and checklists for ensuring consistent data capture across the square.

## Land classes and landscape variation (notes)
- The document includes notes and photographs illustrating various land classes to aid interpretation and categorization of landscapes.
- Classes cover coastal, upland, wolds, heaths, pasture, arable, and mixed agricultural landscapes, with examples and criteria for distinguishing each class.
