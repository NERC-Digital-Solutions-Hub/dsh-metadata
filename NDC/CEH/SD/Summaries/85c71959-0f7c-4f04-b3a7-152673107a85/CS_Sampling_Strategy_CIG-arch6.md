# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Explains how the ITE Land Classification evolved to underpin a stratified, random sampling framework across Great Britain, and how this framework supports national and country-level habitat estimates over time.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representativeness and minimize bias.
  - Land Classification (ITE Land Classification) as the primary stratification system, linking environmental attributes to sampling frameworks.
  - Use of 1 km squares as the fundamental sampling unit for GB ecological surveys.
  - National estimates are derived by combining mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total area of that Land Class.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling (timeline)
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 Land Classes from environmental data for 1,228 central 1 km squares (plus 4 surrounding squares per class).
    - Final sample: eight 1 km squares per class (256 total) for national habitat area estimates.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per Land Class (384 total), still using the 32-class framework; aims to improve robustness of landscape-change estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Re-recorded features from 1984 survey; integration with first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1998/2000 (Revised Land Classification for CS2000)
    - Extended classification to enable separate Scotland and England & Wales reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
    - Adjustments to ensure adequate representation when cross-country Class boundaries existed; creation of separate country-unit classes and aggregation where necessary (resulting in 40 strata).
    - Additional upland module added to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
  - 2007 (Revised Land Classification for CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting needs prompted further refinements.
    - Introduction of country-unit sub-divisions for Wales (creating 5 new Welsh sub-classes) and an increase in Welsh sample squares to at least 6 per Welsh class.
    - England/Wales Wales-specific adjustments while maintaining English class representations; total strata expanded to 45.

- Sampling framework and survey design
  - Stratified sampling aligned with Land Classes to ensure coverage across environmental gradients and land uses.
  - Central 1 km squares (from a 15 x 15 km grid) classified; surrounding four squares allocated to the same class to bolster classification confidence (for CS1978 and subsequent surveys).
  - National estimates computed as: mean habitat area per square within each Land Class × land area of that class.
  - Across surveys, datasets and classifications were updated; national estimates could be produced using either the latest country-specific classification or the original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency.

- Country-specific reporting and adjustments
  - CS2000 introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales vs. Scotland) with refined class subdivisions and new squares to ensure adequate representation per country.
  - Wales required enhanced sampling due to policy and reporting needs, leading to additional Welsh Land Class sub-divisions and extra sample squares.
  - Isle of Man samples replaced to align with England/Wales or Scotland reporting units.

- Uplands module
  - Additional sampling (30 squares) placed within upland classes to improve habitat estimates for uplands in England and Wales, supporting country-based reporting and precision.

- Data outputs and reporting
  - Tables and figures provided in the document illustrate the distribution of sample squares across Land Classes and country units for each survey.
  - Annexes summarize historical development, with brief histories of the Land Classification and detailed descriptions of Land Classes.
  - The document emphasizes consistency and comparability across surveys while addressing the evolving policy and reporting needs of the constituent countries (England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man).

- Notable considerations and guidance for data use
  - Changing Land Classifications affect national stock estimates; preference for latest country-based classifications for internal reporting, with original classifications used for cross-survey comparability when needed.
  - Representation balance across countries and classes is critical; adjustments may reweight class representation to maintain robust country-level estimates.
