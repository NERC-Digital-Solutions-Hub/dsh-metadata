# Countryside Survey 1978 Introduction

## Purpose and scope
- Establish guidelines for field survey to obtain an overall ecological assessment of a 2-kilometre square sampling unit.
- Allow for significant real-world deviations due to conditions; document any divergences.
- Provide a concise, repeatable methodology familiar to participants, with keys and references for various information (e.g., CowS, sheep) all in one place.

## Survey design and sampling
- Core objective: 2 km square ecological assessment with consistent methodology.
- Data collection program within each square:
  - 5 randomly located vegetation plots of about 200 m.
  - 5 randomly located soil pits at the centers of the plots.
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information from the entire square.
- Keys and aggregated data (e.g., CowS, sheep) compiled for easy reference.

## Permissions and field operations
- First stage: obtain permission and ownership information before starting.
- Limit disturbance; explain short visit duration to landowners.
- Record ownership details when possible; note if plots touch crops or land uses.

## Plot location and field procedures
- 200 m vegetation plots marked with five posts; diagonals oriented at right angles; color-coded strings indicate plot markings.
- Plot placement method is objective and random; navigation by map reference and compass.
- If a plot cannot be placed due to features (crops, boundaries, safety), relocate and record the reason.
- Plots are marked on maps to avoid linear features; if pacing lands on a feature, relocate and adjust the map accordingly.
- Five random plots per square are predefined; any changes require careful documentation.
- Species data collected from the plot (vascular plants fully recorded; bryophytes/lichens restricted); determine cover in defined categories.

## Data collection and recording
- Habitats, slope, aspect, and other site attributes are recorded on data sheets (slope measured, aspect along same line).
- Vegetation categories and habitat types are defined with specific criteria (e.g., woodland types, grassland, arable, scrub, etc.).
- Comprehensive lists and tables guide coding of species, habitats, and features, including notes on difficult identifications.
- Separate sections cover ground features, boundaries/roads, agriculture, and various habitat types.

## Soil sampling and horizons
- Soil pit located at the plot center within the designated quarter; if obstructed, relocate to an end of line between plot faces.
- Pit dimensions typically 45–60 cm wide and up to 60–75 cm long; turves removed and soil placed for descent.
- Dig until a horizon of interest is reached (e.g., C or R horizon) or until 75 cm depth; horizons identified and boundaries marked.
- Data sheet completion includes horizon thickness, symbol, moisture, color, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, and additional comments.
- Sampling: collect small samples from the surface horizon or from the next horizon if needed.

## Vegetation, habitats and land-use categories
- Detailed coding system for vegetation types, woodlands, agriculture, boundaries, ground features, habitats (vegetation), crops, and other features.
- Categories cover: woodland structure (hardwood, conifer, mixed, glades, coppice, regeneration, dead trees), agriculture (meadow, pasture, cereals, root crops, arable, horticulture, farm buildings, enclosures, gardens, orchards), boundaries/roads (roads, tracks, hedges, fences, walls, ditches), ground features (cliffs, rocks, rivers, ponds, lakes, peat, strips of riverbank), habitats (rock, aquatic, hedgerows, scrub, etc.), crops, domestic animals, and buildings.
- Provisions for recording principal species within hedges and other key features, plus habitat sketch mapping.
- Extensive reference lists and codes for species aggregates and notable flora/fauna (including bryophytes and lichens; lichens and certain bryophytes require special identification lists).

## Linear features and mapping
- Linear plots (two per feature) located on hedges, streams, roads; data collected in direct line from the two most widely spaced plots in the square.
- Quadrats set with strings and a 1 m measuring stick to trace along curves; species identification follows plot rules.
- Each feature is mapped with the quadrat strings and appropriate marks; principal species cover estimated for hedges and streams.

## Boundaries and hedges
- Boundaries and walls: classify condition and construction (old/new, mortar, turf, wall integrity, gaps, hedges, hedgerow trees).
- Record detailed hedge status: complete hedges, gaps, management (cut/neglected), banked hedges, hedgerow trees, hedgerow removals, and other boundary indicators.
- Species composition for hedgerows recorded (woody plants only) with principal species estimates.

## Sketch map and farmer cooperation
- Sketch map records crops, hedgerows, field boundaries, and notable features to provide a clear field picture.
- Farmers’ notes on varieties and management are encouraged; where possible, identify animal breeds and husbandry.

## Domestic animals, habitats, and buildings
- Documentation of domestic animals (breed types, common local varieties) with keys and picture references.
- Habitats and buildings, including vernacular and non-vernacular architecture, and other landscape features (e.g., parks, roadsides, industrial sites) are categorized and described.
- Special attention to habitat associations (e.g., rock, water, hedges) and associated management implications.

## Data quality, verification and completion
- After fieldwork, verify that all plots and data sheets are complete, and ensure data consistency and accuracy (species IDs, horizon descriptions, and measurements).
- Cross-check map data and ensure no major elements are omitted; finalize with a clean, integrated kilometre square dataset.
- Appendices include Land Classes and additional modification notes for field adaptation.

## Appendices and metadata conventions
- Horizon symbols, color, texture, moisture, structure, and other horizon-level metadata are standardized.
- Species identification and aggregates guidelines, including key bryophyte and lichen lists, are provided for consistent data coding.
- Lists of representative species and taxonomic codes (plants, bryophytes, lichens) support standardized recording and later data analysis.
- Project checklists and equipment lists outline required field tools and documentation standards.
