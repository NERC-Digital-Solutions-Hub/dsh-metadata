# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the development and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey fieldwork from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes the importance of stratified, random sampling to produce robust, comparable national habitat estimates across time and in different country units (England, Scotland, Wales).

## The ITE Land Classification: purpose and foundation
- Purpose: to stratify land into discrete, relatively homogeneous classes to ensure representative sampling and enable national/regional habitat estimates.
- Basis: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to group land into land classes via multivariate classification (Indicator Species Analysis adapted for environmental data).
- Evolution: started with 32 land classes (1978) and expanded over time to better capture regional differences and enable country-specific reporting.

## Chronology of the Countryside Survey sampling framework

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - Used ISA to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1215 of 1228 classified).
  - Classified surrounding four squares per center square, yielding 6039 km2 of classified squares.
  - Field survey comprised 8 squares per land class (total 256); national habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per class times land-class area.

- 1984 – Second Field Survey
  - Used the 32-class framework from 1978; increased sample to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Focus shifted to land use and landscape features; results published in Landscape Changes in Britain.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data for all GB 1 km squares (broader, more comprehensive coverage).
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats recorded; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB from satellite imagery.
  - Results published with Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- 1998/2000 – Revised Land Classification & Separate Country Estimates (CS2000)
  - Aimed to produce separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) due to policy/legislation needs.
  - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; framework subdivided to support country-specific reporting.
  - Changes included class sub-division (country-unit versions), class aggregation in countries with few squares, and additional sampling to ensure adequate representation across new classes.
  - Uplands module added to improve estimates of upland habitats in England and Wales.

- 2007 – Wales- and England- or Wales- Only Reporting Enhancements (CS2007)
  - Further adjustments for Wales-only reporting post-devolution; Wales expanded sampling with new country-unit subclasses (five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh samples (minimum 6 per new Welsh class) to improve Wales-specific precision.
  - England sampling adjusted accordingly to maintain overall balance; introduction of upland-related sampling continuity.

## Country-specific estimates and uplands module
- England, Scotland, and Wales reporting requirements led to:
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit variants.
  - Aggregation of rare sub-classes within a country to maintain adequate sample sizes.
  - Additional squares to ensure representation of new classes in each country, with Wales receiving more intensive sampling due to policy needs.
- Uplands in England and Wales: a dedicated module added in CS2000 to improve habitat estimates in upland areas, funded by multiple agencies.

## Data products and mapping outputs
- Land Classification maps updated across survey iterations (e.g., original, revised England-with-Wales, Scotland; Wales-focused adjustments).
- Maps of Countryside Survey sample squares illustrating spatial distribution of sampling across countries and classes.
- Tables summarizing the numbers of squares per class and per country, sample rates, and spatial coverage for each survey (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).

## Implications for GIS work
- Robust data products rely on a consistent yet adaptable land classification framework that can accommodate country-specific reporting and time-series analysis.
- When applying this framework, GIS analysts must account for:
  - Changes in Land Classification over time which affect comparability of national estimates.
  - Sub-division and aggregation of land classes by country to preserve adequate sample sizes.
  - The need to integrate data from multiple surveys with different class structures and sampling intensities.
  - The linkage between field survey data and land-class-based spatial stratification, and the incorporation of satellite-derived land cover data (as introduced in CS1990).
