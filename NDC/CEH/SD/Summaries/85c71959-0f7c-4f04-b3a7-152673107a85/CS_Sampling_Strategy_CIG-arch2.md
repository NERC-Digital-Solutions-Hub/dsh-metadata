# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy used by Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Emphasises the ITE Land Classification as the core framework for stratifying a national sample of land.
  - Shows how sampling design and land classification evolved to support time-series estimates and country-specific reporting.

- Core concepts for analysts
  - Stratifed, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain’s diverse land types.
  - Use of 1 km squares as the primary sampling units, with a systematic approach to selecting squares within land-class strata.
  - ITE Land Classification: an environmental stratification system derived from climatic, geological and physiographic attributes to group land into distinct classes.

- Evolution of the Land Classification (theoretical basis and practical impact)
  - Early work (1970s) established the concept of stratifying land into classes using environmental attributes.
  - First version (mid- to late-1970s) produced 32 Land Classes from ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) applied to 1 km squares.
  - 1984 update expanded sampling within classes; focus shifted toward land use and habitat mapping.
  - 1990 revision aimed to classify every square in Great Britain, enabling regional and local estimates; resulted in a 40-class system and a broader, all-squares framework.
  - 1998 revision adapted the framework to enable separate reporting for Scotland; number of classes increased (to 40+; later adjustments).
  - 2007 revision introduced country-unit sub-divisions (England with Wales, Scotland, and Wales as separate reporting units), added Welsh-specific classes, and expanded to 45 strata for better country-level estimates.

- Sampling framework and outputs across surveys
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey)
    - 32 Land Classes; 1 km squares central to a 15x15 km grid.
    - 8 squares per class; total 256 squares surveyed.
    - Outputs: national estimates of habitat areas derived from class proportions and square-level data.
  - CS1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Increased sample to 384 squares (12 per class); continued use of Land Classification from CS1978.
  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification updated to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Maintained the 1984 data collection framework; allowed national estimates by class with a revised classification system.
  - CS1998 (Revised Land Classification & 4th Field Survey)
    - Further refinement to support Scotland-only reporting; Land Classes increased to 40.
    - Field survey expanded to 569 squares.
    - Outputs supported habitat estimation with country-specific reporting.
  - CS2000 (Revised Land Classification & 5th Field Survey)
    - Implemented separate country estimates (England & Wales; Scotland) by subdividing Land Classes into country units and increasing representation where needed.
    - Added 30 upland squares to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
    - Wales received additional sampling to support Wales-only reporting (64 Welsh squares; Scotland and England also adjusted).
  - CS2007 (Revised Land Classification & 6th Field Survey)
    - Wales-only reporting formally integrated; five new country-unit classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) plus overall 45 strata.
    - Extra Welsh squares added (43) to ensure representation; some English classes reduced to maintain balance.
    - Wales and England/Scotland maps and class frameworks updated to reflect the new country-unit structure.
    - Outputs continued to include habitat area estimates by Land Class, country-specific estimates, and land-class maps.

- Country-unit reporting and upland focus
  - Separate country estimates became essential after devolution to meet country-specific environmental policy needs.
  - Wales required targeted sampling and Welsh-specific Land Class sub-divisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Upland habitats received dedicated sampling in CS2000 to improve accuracy of England and Wales upland estimates.

- Data availability and usage considerations
  - The strategy underlines the importance of storing and making datasets accessible for reuse and cross-analysis.
  - Notes on consistency: changing the basis of national estimates (latest vs original Land Classification) affects comparability; preferred approach is to use the latest for internal survey consistency while recognizing cross-survey equivalence.

- Practical outputs and representations
  - Land Classes are mapped and periodically revised, with Tables and Figures illustrating class maps and sample square distributions.
  - Outputs include national habitat-area estimates by Land Class, country-unit estimates, and Wales-specific reporting, supported by a growing set of survey squares across years.
  - The methodology emphasizes maintaining a balance between precision (sample size per class) and comparability across time and geographies (England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man).

- Acknowledgements and references
  - Acknowledges contributions from statisticians and ecologists across DETR, CEH, and ITE; recognizes the collaborative development of stratification, sampling, and national estimation methods.
  - Provides a framework and bibliography for further reading on the ITE Land Classification and Countryside Survey methodologies.

- Key takeaway for analysts monitoring environmental health
  - The Countryside Survey sampling strategy demonstrates a rigorous, layered approach to ecological monitoring: a robust, evolving Land Classification framework combined with stratified, country-aware sampling to produce time-series habitat estimates and policy-relevant environmental indicators.
  - The design supports data integration, cross-year comparability, and country-specific policy reporting, while highlighting the ongoing need to adapt sampling to improve value and data accessibility.
