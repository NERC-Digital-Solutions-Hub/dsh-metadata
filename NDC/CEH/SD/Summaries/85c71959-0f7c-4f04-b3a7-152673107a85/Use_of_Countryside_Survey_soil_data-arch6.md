# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Overview
  - Describes the sampling design, locations, sampling methods, measurements, and statistical considerations for Countryside Survey (CS) soils in 2007, building on prior CS surveys (1978, 1998).
  - Includes information on power analyses to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008) and guidance for analysing CS soils data.
  - Notes data release status for certain measurements after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).

- Sampling design
  - Soils were sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007; 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 CS squares, while 2007 expanded to 591 CS squares.
  - Power analyses determined the number of samples needed to detect change over time.

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Samples collected from CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates (they may have very different land uses and soil types).
  - Repositioning or relocation of x-plots occurred due to destruction, access denial, or uncertainty; each sampling location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) referring to a specific square and repeat plot.
  - Across sampling, locations in a square represent distinct locations (ca. 2–3 m apart) within a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot at each site.

- Sampling method
  - Depth: top 15 cm sampled in 1998 and 2007 (8 cm depth for invertebrates).
  - 1978 used a soil pit; later surveys used soil cores hammered into the ground.
  - In some sites, full core collection was not possible due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed core measurements were taken for 2 of the 4 cores.

- Measurements and data collection
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores yield different measurements.
  - Measurements (sampled across cores and squares) include:
    - pH (in water and CaCl2)
    - LOI
    - %C and %N
    - Bulk density (not via ISO core method)
    - Core dimensions and photographs
    - Depth of organic layer
    - Hand texture
    - Soil moisture
    - Olsen P
    - Metals
    - Mineralisable N (in some cores)
  - Coverage
    - Some measurements are available for all 591 CS squares; others are limited to the original 256 squares or to a subset of x-plots within those squares.
  - Data release caveat
    - Some measurements are marked with an asterisk (*) indicating data released only after the Soils Report (November 2009).

- Data structure and metadata
  - Each sampling location within a square has a repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) linking samples to a fixed location within a square while allowing for relocation.
  - Samples from multiple cores per x-plot may have different measurements associated with them.
  - Documentation and methods emphasize that samples are homogenised before certain assays (pH, LOI) and that not all measurements are performed on every core or square.

- Data quality, structure, and analysis guidance
  - Statistical analysis should account for land-class structure to avoid biased national stock/change estimates.
  - If land classes are ignored, results reflect population stock and change; if included, results are weighted by land classes to approximate national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not uniformly applied; recommended approach includes mixed models with square as a random factor to reflect multiple x-plots per square.
  - In CS design, dispersion of samples can increase precision and coverage for regional estimates; design-based approaches may be preferred when spatial structure is not central.
  - Researchers are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications for previously exploited data (CS website references).
