# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of survey site locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
- Confidentiality supports continued ability to inform environmental policy.

## When locations may be released and at what precision
- Approximate release: Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
- Precise release: Six-digit grid references may be released under licence in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external processing by CEH is preferred to avoid release.
- Within-square data (maps of habitats, linear features) carry confidentiality equivalent to location data and require the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.
- If precision is essential, organisations must demonstrate that their IP/confidentiality protections are equal or higher than CS data before any external release.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and for specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar licence terms to six-digit releases but need not meet the higher IP confidentiality threshold; however, no attempt to identify precise square locations is allowed.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, representing NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences containing the policy terms.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organisation.
- If access is denied, CEH will follow the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 procedures.
- CEH reports annually to CS partners on applications for access, including decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support for internal CS partnership use within reasonable demand; other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to data covered by this policy; CEH involvement is negotiable and may be part of collaboration or paid support.

## Practical notes for potential users
- Internal use requires reasonable expectation of CEH pre-processing support within timelines.
- External requests should be assessed case-by-case; CEH engagement is advised to help define requirements and ensure appropriate use.
- The policy ensures data utility for environmental monitoring while safeguarding survey integrity and landowner relations.
