# Countryside Survey 1978 Introduction

- Purpose and scope
  - Define guidelines for the field survey to obtain an overall ecological assessment of each 2-kilometre square in a consistent manner.
  - Allow for variations due to local circumstances; record significant divergences from the basic methodology.
  - Data collection aims to be broadly familiar to participants and to yield comparable ecological information across squares.

- Survey design and data objectives
  - Core data units: 2 km square with multiple sampling elements to capture vegetation, soils, and habitat structure.
  - Sampling components:
    - Five randomly located 200 m vegetation plots per square.
    - Five randomly located soil pits in the centers of plots.
    - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
    - Broad ecological information for the entire kilometre square.
  - Supplementary keys and checklists (e.g., for livestock and farm features) included in the handbook.

- Permissions and field access
  - On arrival, obtain landowner permissions where possible; minimize disturbance.
  - Record ownership details and relevant estate information; note that crops may influence soil pit placement.
  - Responsibility for survey requests rests with the surveyor; maintain concise, positive contact.

- Plot logistics and location method
  - Plot setup: use five posts to form a 200 m square grid; diagonals oriented at right angles.
  - Plot centers determined by navigating to the nearest visible map feature with a compass, then counting paces to the center.
  - In very open terrain, arbitrate location by best approximation; avoid placing plots on features (e.g., roads, hedges).
  - Map plots are marked to avoid linear features; any relocation due to obstructions should be recorded.

- Data collection: vegetation and habitats
  - Vegetation recording:
    - Document all vascular plants; restricted lists for bryophytes and lichens; collect specimens for uncertain taxa.
    - Estimate cover in 5% categories; principal species emphasized; multi-layer vegetation noted with caveats.
    - If plots fall within crops, record edge species from hedgerows/track margins.
  - Habitat and slope:
    - Measure slope from the highest to lowest point in the square; record aspect.
    - Record habitat attributes within the plot and within 50 m, with notes for ambiguous categories.
  - Habitat categories and vegetation types:
    - Extensive categorical scheme including woodland, agriculture, grassland, moorland, bogs, scrub, hedges, boundaries, and various habitat features (e.g., glades, coppice, regeneration, riparian features, etc.).
    - Detailed code sheets and illustrative figures accompany the data sheets.

- Soil pits and soil data
  - Soil pit located at the center of the quadrat, oriented for maximum light on one end to describe horizons.
  - Typical pit dimensions: about 45–60 cm wide, 60–100 cm long; dug to the C, Cr, or R horizon or to 75 cm depth, whichever comes first.
  - Horizons identified and described using standardized boundaries; horizons characterized by color, moisture, texture, structure, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, etc.
  - Data fields include stratum number, horizon thickness, symbol, moisture, color, mottling, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, and comments.
  - Sampling:
    - Collect small surface samples (about 200 mg) from horizons thinner than 5 cm; sample from underlying horizons if needed.

- Linear features and hedges, roads, streams
  - Linear plots along hedges, streams, and roads:
    - Two plots per feature, oriented along the feature, in a 10 m x 1 m configuration.
    - Plot coordinates and species data recorded as in larger quadrats; principal species and hedge density recorded with woody species in brackets.
  - Boundaries and boundaries-related data:
    - Where possible, mark boundaries directly on the map; otherwise provide area-based estimates.
    - Categories include old walls, mortared walls, hedges (various conditions), dykes, fences, and related boundary features.

- Crops, habitats, and buildings
  - Crops: record as agricultural crops or horticultural crops; include notes on varieties where possible.
  - Domestic animals and farm buildings:
    - Obtain farmer input on breeds; use provided keys when possible; describe breeds and cross-breeds if necessary.
  - Habitats and buildings:
    - Document vernacular vs. non-vernacular buildings and other structures (farmhouses, barns, silos, etc.) and their surroundings.

- Data sheets, codes, and identification
  - Horizon symbols, color codes, textures, and structure codes provided on data sheets (and in appendix tables) for consistent recording.
  - Extensive coding lists for species (plants, bryophytes, lichens) and for boundary/habitat features.
  - Guidelines for species identification emphasize pragmatic identification; use indicator species cautiously and exclude uncertain identifications from indicators.
  - Specific lists and examples of common bryophytes and lichens, as well as representative vascular plant groups and grasses, are included.

- Sketch maps and field notes
  - Sketch maps require recording crops, hedgerows/field boundaries, woodlands, and other landcover features to aid interpretation.
  - Record any notable land management features and farmer remarks to provide a contextual picture of the square.

- Project logistics and equipment
  - Checklists and recommended equipment provided (poles, tapes, ground sheets, soil horizons sheets, field guides, plant keys, etc.).
  - Emphasis on efficient field work, data cleanliness, and the ability to cross-check between sheets and maps.

- Conclusions and data quality
  - After completing plots and the kilometre square sheet, verify completeness and consistency of data.
  - Ensure data are clean and interpretable; document any deviations from the standard method.
  - The handbook provides supplementary Land Classes notes and modular guidance to adapt to field conditions.

- Supplementary materials and references
  - Includes example figures, horizon symbol sheets, and extensive lookup tables for habitat, boundary, and species coding.
  - Materials accompany the survey kit to support standardized data collection across squares.
