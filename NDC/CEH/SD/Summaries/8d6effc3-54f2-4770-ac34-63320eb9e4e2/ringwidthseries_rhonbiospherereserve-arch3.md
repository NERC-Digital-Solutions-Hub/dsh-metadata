# This file describes the data in the file RingWidthSeries_RhonnBiosphereReserve.csv.

## Collection/generation methods
- A total of 232 tree cores were collected for European Beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees at sites within the Rhön Biosphere Reserve, Germany.
- Two cores per tree (three if necessary) were taken to account for individual variability in canopy drought impact, tree size and social class.
- The two cores were taken perpendicular to one another (taken at 180° if on a slope).

## Nature and units of recorded Values
- Ring-width measurements were recorded in millimetres.

## Quality control
- Measurements, dating and cross-dating accuracy were assessed using summary statistics and crosschecking with colleagues.

## Details of data structure
- The first column in the excel sheet gives the year of each ring from 1788 to 2021.
- All subsequent columns give ring-width series measurements.
- Naming (given in the first row) is explained as follows: 'FS-001-01-a' = Species Code - Site ID - Tree ID - Core ID.
