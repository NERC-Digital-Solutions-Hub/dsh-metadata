# This file describes the data in the file RingWidthSeries_RhonnBiosphereReserve.csv

## Collection and sampling design
- 232 tree cores collected from European Beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees at sites within the Rhön Biosphere Reserve, Germany.
- Two cores per tree (three cores if necessary) to account for individual variability in canopy drought impact, tree size, and social class.
- Cores taken perpendicular to one another (180° apart) where applicable (e.g., on slopes).

## Measurements and units
- Ring-width measurements recorded in millimetres.

## Quality control
- Measurements, dating, and cross-dating accuracy assessed using summary statistics and crosschecking with colleagues.

## Data structure and naming
- First column of the Excel sheet contains the year of each ring, ranging from 1788 to 2021.
- All subsequent columns contain ring-width series measurements.
- Naming convention (in the header row): FS-001-01-a = Species Code - Site ID - Tree ID - Core ID.
