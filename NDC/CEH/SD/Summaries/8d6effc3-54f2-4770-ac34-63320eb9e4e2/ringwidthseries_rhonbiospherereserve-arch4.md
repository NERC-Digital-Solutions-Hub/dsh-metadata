# This file describes the data in the file RingWidthSeries_RhonnBiosphereReserve.csv.

## Overview
- Dataset of ring-width measurements from European Beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees in the Rhön Biosphere Reserve, Germany.
- 232 tree cores collected; up to three cores per tree to capture variability in canopy drought impact, tree size, and social class.
- Cores taken perpendicular to each other (180° on slopes).

## Data collection and scope
- Site: Rhön Biosphere Reserve, Germany.
- Species: European Beech (Fagus sylvatica).
- Sampling: 232 cores, with two cores per tree (three if necessary) to account for individual variability.

## Measurements and units
- Ring-width measurements recorded in millimetres (mm).

## Quality control
- Dating and cross-dating accuracy assessed using summary statistics and crosschecking with colleagues.

## Data structure and naming
- Data organized in an Excel sheet.
- First column: year of each ring, spanning from 1788 to 2021.
- Remaining columns: ring-width series measurements for each core.
- Naming convention (example): FS-001-01-a = Species Code - Site ID - Tree ID - Core ID.

## Data governance and usability implications for data leaders
- Clear provenance and collection methods support traceability and reproducibility.
- Standardized units and consistent cross-dating QA facilitate integration with other datasets.
- Structured naming and column layout enhance discoverability, interoperability, and reuse across networks.
- Long time-span (1788–2021) enables historical analyses of growth patterns and climate relationships.
