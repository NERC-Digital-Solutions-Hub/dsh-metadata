# This file describes the data in the file RingWidthSeries_RhonnBiosphereReserve.csv.

## Overview
- Data describe ring-width series for European Beech (Fagus sylvatica) at Rhön Biosphere Reserve, Germany.
- 232 tree cores collected; two cores per tree (three if necessary) to account for variability in canopy drought impact, tree size, and social class.
- Cores taken perpendicular to one another (180°) if collected on a slope.

## Collection/generation methods
- Species: European Beech (Fagus sylvatica).
- Locations: Sites within the Rhön Biosphere Reserve (Germany).
- Sampling strategy: two cores per tree (or three if needed) to capture individual variability.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Ring-width measurements recorded in millimetres (mm).

## Quality control
- Measurement, dating, and cross-dating accuracy assessed using summary statistics and peer crosschecking.

## Details of data structure
- First column: year of each ring, ranging from 1788 to 2021.
- Subsequent columns: ring-width series measurements for individual cores/tree.
- Naming convention (first row): FS-001-01-a = Species Code - Site ID - Tree ID - Core ID.
