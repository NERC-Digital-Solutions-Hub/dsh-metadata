# This file describes the data in the file RingWidthSeries_RhonnBiosphereReserve.csv.

## Overview
- Dataset describes tree-ring width measurements for European Beech (Fagus sylvatica) at Rhön Biosphere Reserve, Germany.
- Sample size: 232 tree cores.
- Sampling detail: two cores per tree (three if necessary) to account for variability; cores taken perpendicular to one another (180° on slopes).
- Data focus: ring-width series across years 1788 to 2021.

## Collection/Generation Methods
- Species: European Beech (Fagus sylvatica).
- Cores: 232 collected from trees within the Rhön Biosphere Reserve.
- Core positioning: two per tree, perpendicular (180° on slopes) to capture variation.

## Nature and Units of Recorded Values
- Ring-width measurements recorded in millimetres.

## Quality Control
- Measurements, dating, and cross-dating accuracy assessed.
- QA performed using summary statistics and crosschecking with colleagues.

## Details of Data Structure
- First column: year of each ring (1788–2021).
- Remaining columns: ring-width series measurements for each core/tree.
- Naming convention (explained in first row): FS-001-01-a = Species Code - Site ID - Tree ID - Core ID.
