# This file describes the data in the file RingWidthSeries_RhonnBiosphereReserve.csv.

## Overview
- 232 tree cores collected from European Beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees within the Rhön Biosphere Reserve, Germany.
- For each tree, two cores were taken (a third core if necessary) to account for variability in canopy drought response, tree size, and social class.
- Cores were taken perpendicular to one another (180° on slopes).

## Data collection and methods
- Ring-width measurements are recorded in millimetres.
- Collection aimed to capture accurate ring-width data across multiple trees and cores.

## Data structure and naming
- The first column contains the year for each ring, spanning 1788 to 2021.
- All subsequent columns contain ring-width series measurements for individual cores.
- Naming convention (as described in the first row) follows: Species Code - Site ID - Tree ID - Core ID (example: FS-001-01-a).

## Quality control
- Measurements, dating, and cross-dating accuracy were assessed using summary statistics and by crosschecking with colleagues.
