# This file describes the data in the file RingWidthSeries_RhonnBiosphereReserve.csv.

## Overview
- 232 tree cores collected from European Beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees at sites within the Rhön Biosphere Reserve, Germany.
- Two cores per tree were taken (three if necessary) to account for variability in canopy drought impact, tree size, and social class.
- Cores were taken perpendicular to one another (180° if on a slope).

## Measurements and units
- Ring-width measurements recorded in millimetres.

## Quality control
- Measurements, dating, and cross-dating accuracy assessed using summary statistics and crosschecking with colleagues.

## Data structure and naming
- The first column in the Excel sheet provides the year for each ring, spanning 1788 to 2021.
- All subsequent columns contain ring-width series measurements.
- Naming scheme example: FS-001-01-a, where FS = Species Code, 001 = Site ID, 01 = Tree ID, a = Core ID.

## Context and purpose
- Data describe ring-width series for Beech trees within the Rhön Biosphere Reserve, detailing collection methods, units, and the structure of the dataset to support standardized analysis and interpretation.
