# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Cores taken approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot of every square (total of five sampling locations per square). If issues arise, note in the envelope (e.g., large roots, misalignment).
- If vegetation is unusual, cow pat, boulder, etc., move minimum distance to obtain a homogeneous location and record the problem.
- Core allocation per X-plot:
  - Core C: BLACK 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter (located 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner)
  - Core F: SHORT WHITE 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter (15 cm east of the black core; leave the litter layer intact)
  - Core N: LONG WHITE 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter (15 cm south of the black core)
  - Core P: LONG GREY 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter (15 cm west of the black core; must be right way up with bevelled end on the soil surface)
- Core handling:
  - Ensure correct core in the correct position; clear surface vegetation
  - Insert pipe upright, cut bottom edge, push into ground, use grey plate and hammer to level with soil surface
  - If soil depth is insufficient or the pipe breaks, adjust or use a spare pipe
  - Twist/pull carefully to avoid soil loss; remove exterior lumps
  - If needed, cut bottom of the core to level with pipe end; cap ends when samples are obtained
- Sampling per square:
  - Four cores and four sample bags per X-plot
  - Additionally, a composite soil sample (8–10 sub-samples to 15 cm depth) collected along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, using the long thin trowel to form a square
  - Move vegetation as required to access soil; repeat 8–10 times (at least 2 on each side of the quadrat); combine into a single bag
  - When the bag is full to the top white panel, seal and place in another bag if needed
- Storage requirements during collection:
  - Note any problems or deviations in the envelope provided

- Additional note: These samples are to be taken in 120 squares only; a labelled sealable bag and mail bag are provided for X-plots where these samples are to be collected.

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Core C: BLACK
  - Store in its own bag; once all black cores for a square are collected, store together in a spare plastic bag
  - Store in a cardboard box in the vehicle, cool and away from direct sunlight until returned to the regional co-ordinator
- Core F: SHORT WHITE
  - Place in its bag with other short white cores from the square; store in the cool box
  - When all five samples are taken, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post ASAP
- Core P: GREY
  - Place in its bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box
  - When all five samples are taken, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post ASAP
- Core N: WHITE
  - Place in its bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box
  - When all five samples are taken, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Bangor; seal and post ASAP
- Soil Sample Bag
  - Place this sample in the cool box immediately; as soon as possible place in mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post
- Posting guidelines
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If posting by last post on Thursday is not possible, place in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post on a Friday
  - If nearest post boxes cannot take these packages, use a convenient Post Office
  - Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Offices
