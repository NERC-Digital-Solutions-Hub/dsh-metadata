# Soil Core Sampling Protocol for X-plots

## Aim
- Standardize the collection, labeling, storage, and shipment of soil core samples from X-plots to ensure data quality, traceability, and timely availability for analysis.

## Scope and Key Concepts
- Five soil sampling locations per square: Core C (black), Core F (short white), Core N (long white), Core P (long grey), and a composite SQID sample (8–10 sub-samples around the 5 m quadrat boundary).
- Cores are oriented and labeled precisely to ensure correct position, depth, and order; discrepancies or unusual observations are documented.

## Equipment and Materials
- Electric Cold Box (kept cool while vehicle is driven)
- Mains charger for accommodation
- 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, mallet, long thin trowel, regular trowel
- 2 pairs of pliers, notebook & pen, parcel tape
- Spare cores and a pack containing:
  - X-plot packs with cores, end caps, and labelled bags
  - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

## Sampling Procedures (Core-by-Core)
- For each X-plot, locate and use the appropriate labelled bags for the 4 cores; collect five sampling locations per square (four individual cores plus the composite sample).
- Core C (Black): 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner; place in its bag and keep upright.
- Core F (Short White): 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact; seal in its bag.
- Core N (Long White): 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from south corner of centre quadrat); seal in its bag.
- Core P (Long Grey): 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm west of the black core; ensure correct orientation (bevelled end up); seal in its bag.
- Composite SQID Sample: 8–10 sub-samples taken with the long thin trowel along the quadrat boundary; fill the labelled bag to the top white panel; if needed, reseal in an outer bag.

## Handling, Labeling, and Documentation
- For any problems (e.g., large roots, cow pat, boulder), move to a more suitable point and record the issue in the envelope with the sample.
- Ensure correct core positioning, orientation, and depth; use spare cores if a core is damaged.
- Each square’s samples are packaged to prevent loss of soil from either end of the pipe; each sub-sample is carefully scraped and sealed.
- Document any deviations or unusual vegetation in the envelope.

## Storage and Dispatch
- After collection, cores are stored in the vehicle’s cool box:
  - Core C: keep together in its bag; store all black cores together in a spare bag; place in a cardboard box in the vehicle; avoid direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator.
  - Core F: bag in a larger plastic bag with other short white cores; store in cool box; after five samples, place in mailbag for CEH Lancaster and post promptly.
  - Core P: bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; post as above.
  - Core N: bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; post to CEH Bangor.
  - Soil Sample Bag: keep in the cool box; post to CEH Lancaster.
- Posting schedule:
  - Post samples as soon as possible.
  - If last post on Thursday is not feasible, store in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday.
  - Do not post on Friday.
  - If nearest post boxes are unsuitable, use a convenient Post Office; consult OS map data or a Road Atlas for Post Office locations.

## Data Governance and Practical Considerations for Data Stewards
- Documentation and provenance: strict labeling, bagging, and sealing procedures to enable traceability and reproducibility.
- Standardization: uniform core IDs, positions, and depths to ensure cross-square comparability and metadata consistency.
- Metadata readiness: clear notes in envelopes for each sample to capture field conditions, deviations, and potential limitations.
- Timeliness and accessibility: defined posting workflow to ensure timely data submission to laboratories and datasets.
- Interoperability and data quality: consistent formats and procedures to minimize handling differences across plots and teams.

## Potential Challenges (Highlighted by the Protocol)
- Incomplete or inconsistent user needs reflected in field notes or metadata gaps.
- Timely receipt of data-producing samples due to posting constraints.
- Ensuring data creators (field teams) adhere to prescribed standards for labeling and storage.
- Managing multiple systems and formats across different lab receiving centers and regional coordinators.
- Handling large volumes of samples and older, non-interoperable storage environments.
