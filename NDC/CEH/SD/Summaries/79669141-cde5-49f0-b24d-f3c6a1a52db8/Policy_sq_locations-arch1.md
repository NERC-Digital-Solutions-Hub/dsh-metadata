# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- The Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future surveying permissions.
- Requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- 4-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify 10x10 km grid squares, when approximate location is valuable.
- 6-digit grid references: can be provided only in very exceptional circumstances; must be licensed and require demonstration that associated data/products have equal or higher confidentiality protections.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) pose similar risks and are subject to the same exceptional-circumstances terms as six-digit location data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could reveal square locations; must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP if requested.
- Four-digit releases have lower IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations or to claim such derivations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If release is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case for other organisations.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
