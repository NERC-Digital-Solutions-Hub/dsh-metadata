# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Purpose: Procedure and equipment for collecting soil cores in X-plots across 120 squares, plus storage and dispatch of samples.
- Equipment to be kept and used:
  - Electric Cold Box (kept cool by charging when vehicle is driven; connected to vehicle lighter socket)
  - Electrical mains charger for use in accommodation
  - 2 knives
  - 2 plastic plates
  - Hammer
  - 2 pairs of pliers
  - Mallet
  - Regular trowel
  - Notebook & pen
  - Long thin trowel
  - Parcel tape
  - Spare cores
  - 1 pack per square containing:
    - X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags
    - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

## Soil core sampling procedures

- Sampling location and purpose:
  - Cores taken approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot.
  - If issues arise (e.g., large roots, unusual vegetation), record in envelope notes and adjust sampling point to achieve a homogeneous, sensible location.
- Handling field notes:
  - If problems or unusual conditions are encountered (e.g., cow pat, boulder), record the issue and adjust sampling distance as needed.
  - Move sampling point as required to gain a representative sample and record any adjustments.

## Core types and positions

- Core C: BLACK 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter
  - Located 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner (use black core as distance reference)
  - After collection, place into its labelled plastic bag
- Core F: SHORT WHITE 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - Located 15 cm east of the black core
  - Leave litter layer intact
  - Cap ends of the pipe after sampling; seal in its bag
- Core N: LONG WHITE 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - Located 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner of the centre quadrat)
  - Cap ends and seal in its bag
- Core P: LONG GREY 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - Located 15 cm west of the black core
  - Ensure correct orientation with bevelled end on the soil surface
  - Cap ends and seal in its bag

## Composite soil sample

- For 120 squares, take one composite soil sample per square:
  - Fill the plastic bag to the top of the top white panel with 8–10 sub-samples taken with the long thin trowel to a depth of 15 cm
  - Sub-samples should be taken along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, spaced evenly around the sides
  - If necessary, repeat sampling until the bag is full to the white panel
  - If issues occur during sampling, record in the envelope and adjust as needed
  - After filling, seal the bag and place it in another sealed bag

## Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Per-square storage and handling:
  - Core C (BLACK): store in its bag; once all black cores for a square are collected, place together in a spare plastic bag; store in a cardboard box in the vehicle; keep cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): place in its bag inside a larger plastic bag with other short white cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all five samples are taken, place in the mailbag labeled CEH Lancaster and post promptly
  - Core P (GREY): place in its bag inside a larger plastic bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all five samples are taken, place in the mailbag labeled CEH Lancaster and post promptly
  - Core N (WHITE): place in its bag inside a larger plastic bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all five samples are taken, place in the mailbag labeled CEH Bangor and post promptly
  - Composite soil sample: place in the cool box immediately; as soon as possible, place in the mailbag labeled CEH Lancaster and post promptly

## Posting

- Post samples as soon as possible
- If samples cannot be posted by the last post on Thursday, place them in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
- Do not post any samples on Friday
- If nearest post boxes won’t accept these packages, use a convenient Post Office
- Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Offices if needed

## Notes for monitoring framework authors

- Standardization: clearly defined core types, dimensions, and relative positions to a fixed reference (centre quadrat) support reproducibility and cross-square comparability.
- Metadata and provenance: explicit notes for sampling problems and adjustments improve data provenance and transparency.
- Data management implications: structured labeling, dedicated packaging, and defined post destinations support traceability and data linkage to labs or coordinators.
- Timeliness and governance: defined timelines for dispatch (no Friday posting, weekend cooling if needed) help ensure timely data delivery and reduce delays.
- Barriers observed in practice (relevant to monitoring frameworks): potential data gaps from inaccessible data points, need for consistent metadata capture, and ensuring data sharing alignments with governance requirements; the procedure itself emphasizes documentation of anomalies to mitigate these issues.
