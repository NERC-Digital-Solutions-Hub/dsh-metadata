# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Establishes a consistent, time-series sampling framework to monitor the condition of Britain’s countryside habitats and landscapes.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification to stratify field sampling and enable policy-relevant environmental estimates over time.
  - Emphasises verification, quality assurance, data cleaning, transformation, and clear outputs (reports, maps, charts).

- Core concepts
  - ITE Land Classification: a stratified environmental framework used to divide land into classes for representative sampling.
  - Stratified random sampling: used to reduce bias by ensuring representative coverage across land classes (strata).
  - 1 km square sampling units: primary spatial unit for field surveys; larger squares mapped via landscape attributes.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA): historical multivariate method used to group quadrats into land classes at the outset.

- Evolution of the sampling framework (timeline)
  - 1978 (Initial survey): 32 Land Classes; centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid classified; 256 squares sampled (8 per class); national habitat estimates derived from class proportions.
  - 1984 (Land use survey): framework retained from 1978; sample size increased (12 squares per class; total 384); emphasis on land use and habitat mapping.
  - 1990 (All Squares/Land Classification): expanded to classify every GB square using key climatic, geological, and physiographic factors; 508 squares surveyed; integration with the first Land Cover Map of GB; national estimates recalculated using the updated system.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification): further development to support Scotland-only reporting; Land Classes increased to 40; improved regional applicability.
  - 2000 (CS2000): aim to provide separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40–45 strata; additional squares added to ensure representation; uplands habitat module introduced to improve upland estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007): adjustments for Wales-only reporting; introduction of Welsh sub-classes (5 new Wales-specific classes); overall expansion to 45 strata; additional Welsh Squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class); upland sampling refined; England adjustments to maintain representation.

- Country-specific and upland components
  - Separate country estimates: England & Wales together and Scotland reported separately; adjustments included class subdivisions, aggregations, and extra squares to ensure adequate representation per country.
  - Wales-only reporting: introduced due to devolved policy needs; additional Welsh classes and more Welsh sample squares to improve Wales-specific estimates.
  - Uplands module: an additional CS2000/CS2007 component added to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

- Sampling numbers and output format
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (all GB squares reclassified; 3rd field survey).
  - CS2000: expanded frame with 40–45 strata; country-unit subdivisions; upland module added; total sampling adjusted to improve country-specific estimates.
  - CS2007: Wales-specific enhancements; 45 strata; Welsh sampling strengthened; continued upland focus; overall country-based representativeness improved.
  - Outputs: distribution of sample squares by class; maps of land classifications and sampling locations; tables of survey squares and sampling rates; national estimates derived from class-level calculations.

- National estimates and data integrity
  - National estimates are calculated by combining mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total area of that class.
  - Changes to the Land Classification over time affect cross-survey comparability; within-survey consistency is preferred when estimating national totals, while older classifications provide cross-survey continuity.
  - Acknowledges potential distortions in class representation due to reclassification; adjustments made through subdivisions/aggregations and targeted sampling.

- Data management and dissemination
  - Outputs are presented in reports, maps, and charts; datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals for access and reuse.
  - The strategy emphasizes increasing the value of datasets by enabling access to underlying data used to create outputs.

- Historical references and lineage
  - The document traces the development of the ITE Land Classification and Countryside Survey sampling from 1978 through 2007, detailing methodological advances and policy-aligned adaptations (Scotland-only reporting, Wales-only reporting, upland modules).

- Practical takeaway for monitoring analysts
  - Start with a robust, stratified sampling framework grounded in a well-documented land classification to ensure representative, time-series data.
  - Use standardized procedures for data quality assurance, transformation, and storage to enable long-term scrutiny of environmental health.
  - Align sampling design with policy needs (e.g., country-specific reporting) while maintaining the ability to track trends over time.
  - Be transparent about changes in classification and sampling, and provide clear guidance on comparability across survey iterations.
