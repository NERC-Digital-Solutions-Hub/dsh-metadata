# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public-interest use of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.
- CS partners include CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidential to preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- These elements are essential for the survey’s scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permissions.
- Confidentiality supports the public interest by ensuring future surveys and policy-relevant insights remain viable.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations can be released
- Data access can indicate whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing a CS square.
- Six-digit precise locations are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may pre-process analyses to avoid releasing locations.
- Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals for the defined project.
- Licences are finite and data must be destroyed at the end of the licensing period; no retention for other duties.
- No data or images should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality level of six-digit releases; license terms prohibit attempts to deduce precise locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Licences must be signed by an authorized representative of the licensee organization.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI/Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report on applications for access to location data, including decisions and grounds.
- For internal CS-partner use, CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable demand; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid and is negotiated case-by-case.
