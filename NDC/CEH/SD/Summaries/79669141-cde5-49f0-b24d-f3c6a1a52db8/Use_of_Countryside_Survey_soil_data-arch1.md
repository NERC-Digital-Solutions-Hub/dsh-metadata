# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Sampling design and scope
  - Soils sampled in 1978, 1998 and 2007.
  - 256 squares sampled in 1978/1998; 591 CS squares sampled in 2007.
  - Not all measurements were made on all samples.
  - Power analyses conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 randomly spaced x-plots.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates (different land uses, soil types, etc.).
  - Plots may be relocated over time due to destruction, access permissions, or relocation uncertainty.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) linking to a known position; exact sampling points within a 2m x 2m plotted area are ~2–3 m apart.
  - Over time, repeated sampling reflects changes at the same location despite slight positional shifts.

- Sampling methods and depth
  - Soils sampled from the top 15 cm of the profile (8 cm depth for invertebrate sampling).
  - 1998/2007 used soil cores; 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm.
  - Full core collection sometimes limited by stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken in 2007 for some cores.

- Measurements and laboratory procedures
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements on different cores (Table 1).
  - Samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density core method).
  - A full description of methods and implications is provided in Emmett et al. (2008).

- Measurements recorded (Table 1 overview)
  - pH (in water and CaCl2)
  - %C and %N
  - Bulk density
  - Core dimensions
  - Photography data
  - Depth of organic layer
  - Hand texture
  - Soil moisture
  - Olsen P
  - Metals
  - Mineralisable N
  - Measurements are reported for different subsets of cores (e.g., 2 of the 5 x-plots, 3 of the 5 x-plots, etc.)
  - Data release for many measurements occurred after the Soils Report published November 2009

- Data structure and statistical considerations
  - Analyses may need to account for land class structure to avoid biased estimates (stock and change vs. national estimates when weighted by land classes).
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses.
  - Recommended approach: use mixed models with square as a random factor to reflect multiple x-plots per CS square.
  - For design-based approaches (where spatial structure is not central), a dispersed set of observations can improve regional precision and coverage.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review existing CS publications exploiting the data (listed on the CS website).

- Data availability and provenance
  - Measurements were collected across all 591 CS squares; some measurements were only available for original 256 squares.
  - Some data (notably certain measurements) were released only after November 2009 following the Soils Report.
