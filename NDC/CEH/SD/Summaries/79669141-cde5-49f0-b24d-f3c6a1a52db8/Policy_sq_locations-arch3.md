# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity. The policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

- CS partners (owners/decision-makers on policy):
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - The Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Why locations are confidential:
  - To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill
  - To protect future survey participation, scientific integrity, environment, and permission from landowners
  - Future surveys would be compromised if confidentiality is breached

- Release to external users: when and at what precision
  - Approximate location usefulness: four-digit grid references may be released under licence (identifies the 10x10 km grid containing the square)
  - Precise locations: six-digit grid references require CEH to undertake pre-processing analysis to avoid release; very exceptional cases may permit external release under licence if IP/data confidentiality is equally or more protected than CS data
  - Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features): treated as potentially identifying; released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations

- Specific conditions of release (licence terms)
  - Preserve confidentiality; data stored securely with access limited to named individuals with legitimate need
  - Licences granted for finite periods for specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities
  - End of licence: written confirmation that data has remained secure and has been destroyed
  - No third-party release that could compromise confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt
  - Data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or check landowner compliance
  - If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP)
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP/confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases
  - Licences for spatial data/four-digit releases include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise square locations

- Responsibilities and decision-making
  - CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences
  - Licences must be signed by authorised representatives of the licensee
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under relevant Act/Regulations
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds
  - Internal partner use: CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within feasible timeframes
  - Requests from external organisations handled case-by-case
  - Partners are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to use policy-covered data; CEH may provide scientific support as part of collaboration or for payment, negotiated case-by-case

- Practical guidance
  - The policy balances enabling data utility with protecting sampling integrity and landowner cooperation
  - Future access considerations depend on maintaining confidentiality and robust data governance
  - Annual reporting and pre-processing support help ensure transparent, responsible use of location data
