# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, environmental protection, and continued permission to survey land.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released (precision levels)

- Access allows identifying whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require CEH pre-processing to avoid disclosure; very exceptional cases may permit external release under licence if the requester shows equal/higher confidentiality protection for associated IP.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and are treated with the same exceptional conditions as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release

- Licences must preserve confidentiality, require secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are for finite periods; data must not be retained beyond the agreed project.
- End-of-licence destruction confirmation must be provided in writing.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan or visit CS squares, nor to check landowner compliance.
- Evidence of project management standards (at least JCOP-equivalent) may be requested from licensees.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria; users must not attempt to derive precise locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee organisation.
- If a release is denied, CEH will follow statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH will provide an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal processing needs (pre-processing) within moderate demand; other requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or require payment, negotiated case-by-case.
