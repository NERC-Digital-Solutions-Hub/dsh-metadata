# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- A historical and methodological overview of how Countryside Survey field sampling and the ITE Land Classification have evolved from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes the role of stratified sampling and environmental land classifications to ensure representative national, regional, and country-specific estimates.
- Highlights the move from a partial classification to all-squares classification, and then to country-specific (England, Scotland, Wales) reporting, including upland habitat modules.
- Documents the number and distribution of sample squares, the process of class subdivision and aggregation, and the rationale for additional sampling in Wales and uplands.
- Notes the implications for data consistency and comparability across survey years due to changes in classification schemes and sampling frames.
- Provides references, acknowledgments, and detailed appendices on the development history of the ITE Land Classification.
