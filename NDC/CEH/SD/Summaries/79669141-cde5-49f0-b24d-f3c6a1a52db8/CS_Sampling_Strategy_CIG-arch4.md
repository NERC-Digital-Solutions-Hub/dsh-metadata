# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Overview
- Describes the sampling framework used for the Countryside Survey field element up to 2007, built on the ITE Land Classification (developed over 30 years since 1978).
- Emphasises a stratified, random sampling approach to ensure representative sampling of Great Britain’s land types and to support robust national and country-specific habitat estimates.
- Highlights the link between data collection (field surveys) and classification, and how changes to classification affect comparability and national estimates.

## Core data architecture and classification
- ITE Land Classification as the backbone:
  - Classifies land into discrete land classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to stratify sampling.
  - Enables extrapolation of national habitat areas from sample square data.
- Sampling unit and design:
  - Primary unit: 1 km x 1 km squares across GB.
  - Initial approach used centre squares with four surrounding squares per classified unit to form strata.
  - Field surveys targeted a minimum number of squares per land class to balance representation and resources.
- Data products:
  - Land Class maps and associated habitat/land-use data derived from field surveys (vegetation, soils, landscape features).
  - National estimates calculated as: mean habitat area per square in a land class multiplied by the land class area.
- Data governance and metadata:
  - Emphasises the need to track changes in classification over time and their impact on estimates and comparability.
  - Recognises policy-driven needs for country-specific reporting and the corresponding data framework adjustments.

## Evolution by survey year

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification (& 1st Field Survey)
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 central squares.
  - Four surrounding squares per centre square were classified, yielding 6039 km squares.
  - 8 km squares per land class surveyed (total 256) to estimate national habitat areas.

- 1984 – 2nd Field Survey
  - Sampling increased to 12 km squares per land class (384 total).
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (& 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification expanded to classify every GB 1 km square.
  - 508 squares surveyed; added urban/sea corrections; repeat vegetation data from 1978.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB (from satellite imagery).
  - National estimates based on the updated all-squares classification.

- 1998/2000 – Revised Land Classification (& 4th Field Survey)
  - Class framework expanded to support separate Scottish reporting; total classes increased to 40.
  - To support policy needs, England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man reporting were considered; a revised framework enabled country-specific estimates.
  - Separate country estimates introduced: sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions; class aggregation where needed; additional squares added (notably to ensure adequate representation of new classes).
  - An upland habitat module was introduced to improve accuracy for upland regions.

- 2007 – Revised Land Classification (& 5th Field Survey)
  - Wales-specific reporting requirements prompted further adjustments.
  - Welsh-only estimates necessitated new Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an expanded set to 45 strata.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure minimum representation in Welsh classes; England adjustments were made where Welsh squares were removed.
  - Wales became the most intensively sampled country unit; England and Scotland sampling revised accordingly.
  - Sampling maps and tables updated to reflect the England-with-Wales and Scotland frameworks and Wales-specific subdivisions.

## Country reporting and upland focus
- Separate country estimates:
  - Framework evolved to enable England with Wales and Scotland reporting using country-specific squares.
  - Adjustments included sub-dividing land classes by country units and aggregating minor remnants to maintain robust estimates per country.
- Wales and uplands:
  - Wales required enhanced sampling and country-unit class subdivisions to deliver Wales-only results.
  - An upland module was incorporated to improve habitat estimates in upland areas, with targeted additional squares.

## Practical implications for data leadership
- Time-series comparability:
  - Changes in Land Classification affect the consistency of GB-wide estimates; two approaches exist:
    - Use the latest classification for GB consistency (better alignment with current framework but reduced cross-survey comparability).
    - Use original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency (better across surveys but less aligned with current geography).
- Data representativeness and quality:
  - Stratified random sampling minimizes bias and supports more precise country-level estimates.
  - Increasing class granularity (country-unit subdivisions) improves policy-relevant reporting but adds complexity to data management and analysis.
- Metadata and governance:
  - Documentation of classification versions, class definitions, and country-unit definitions is essential for correct interpretation and longitudinal analyses.
  - The framework demonstrates the importance of aligning data collection, classification, and reporting requirements with evolving policy needs.
