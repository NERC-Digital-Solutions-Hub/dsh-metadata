# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Electric Cold Box: kept cool by charging while vehicle is driven; connected to vehicle lighter socket.
- Electrical mains charger provided for use in accommodation.
- Tools and items: 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs of pliers, mallet, regular trowel, long thin trowel, notebook & pen, parcel tape, spare cores.
- 1 pack for the appropriate square containing: X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags; stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots.

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Sampling location: cores taken approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot of every square.
- Documentation: if problems or notable observations, place a note in the envelope (e.g., roots, misalignment). Move to a more homogeneous spot if unusual vegetation or obstacles exist and record.
- Core collection procedure (for each core):
  - Use the correctly labeled bag; locate 4 cores and 4 sample bags.
  - Clear surface vegetation; hold pipe upright on soil surface; cut bottom edge; insert to required depth.
  - Push pipe into ground until upright; place grey plastic plate on top and hammer to level with soil surface.
  - If depth is insufficient, move sampling point and start again; avoid losing soil from ends.
  - If pipe breaks, use spare pipe.
  - Remove pipe slowly with pliers to avoid soil loss; use trowel to prevent soil loss.
  - Scrape off soil from exterior; adjust bottom end if needed.
  - Repeat for each centre quadrat in each X-plot (5 sampling locations per square).
- Core types and locations:
  - Core C: BLACK, 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of centre quadrat corner.
  - Core F: SHORT WHITE, 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter; 15 cm east of black core; litter layer left intact.
  - Core N: LONG WHITE, 15 cm x 4 cm; 15 cm south of black core.
  - Core P: LONG GREY, 15 cm x 4 cm; 15 cm west of black core; orientation with bevelled end on soil surface (right way up).
- Composite soil sample: for 120 squares, 8–10 sub-samples taken with long thin trowel to 15 cm depth along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat; place into bag to fill to top white panel; if underfilled, continue sampling until full; seal bag and place in another bag if needed.

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Storage by core type:
  - Core C (BLACK): bag cores together; store in spare plastic bag; keep in cardboard box in vehicle away from direct sunlight and cool until returned to regional coordinator.
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): bag with other short white cores; store in cool box; after five samples, place in mailbag for CEH Lancaster; seal and post promptly.
  - Core P (GREY): bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; after five samples, place in mailbag for CEH Lancaster; seal and post promptly.
  - Core N (WHITE): bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; after five samples, place in mailbag for CEH Bangor; seal and post promptly.
- General soil sample bag: place in cool box immediately; as soon as possible place in mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post.
- Posting guidelines:
  - Post samples as soon as possible.
  - If last post is Thursday, place in cool box over weekend and post on Monday; do not post on Friday.
  - If nearby post boxes cannot accept packages, use a convenient Post Office; reference OS map or Road Atlas for Post Offices.
