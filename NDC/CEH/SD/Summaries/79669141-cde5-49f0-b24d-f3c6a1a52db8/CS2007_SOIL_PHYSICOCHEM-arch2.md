  - Data cover up to 591 1km squares (Great Britain) with multiple plots per square.

- Data structure and coverage
  - CS2007_SOIL_PHYSICOCHEM.csv contains per-site and per-sample measurements for:
    - SQUARE, PLOT, YEAR
    - PH (fresh soil pH in water)
    - LOI (loss on ignition; %)
    - C_CONC_LOI (carbon concentration from LOI; g/kg; 0.55 x LOI)
    - C_STOCK_LOI (carbon stock from LOI; t/ha; 0.55 x LOI)
    - BULK_DENSITY (g/cm3)
    - MOISTURE (%)
    - N_PERCENT (% nitrogen)
    - N_STOCK (N stock; t/ha; 0-15 cm)
    - PO4_OLSEN (Olsen phosphorus; mg/kg)
    - LC07, LC07_NUM (ITE Land Class 2007)
    - COUNTRY, COUNTY07, EZ_DESC_07 (geographic descriptors)
  - Core depth for LOI and N measurements: topsoil (about 0-15 cm) with specific sampling geometry across years.

- Measurement methods and calculations
  - pH measurements
    - Two measurements per subsample: pH in deionised water and in 0.01 M CaCl2.
    - Fresh soil pH in water: 10 g soil with 25 ml deionised water (soil:water ratio 1:2.5); read after 30 minutes.
    - Field conditions: measure promptly after opening; temperature of buffers within 1°C of soil suspension; careful electrode cleaning between measurements.
  - Quality control for pH
    - Batch calibration checked after every 25 samples with pH 4 and pH 7 buffers; recalibrate if deviations >0.02 pH units.
    - Include a standard soil, a certified reference soil, and a duplicate per batch.
  - LOI (Loss on Ignition)
    - Up to 3145 black cores analysed at CEH Lancaster.
    - Method: 10 g air-dried sub-sample; dry at 105°C for 16 h; weigh; combust at 375°C for 16 h; reweigh to calculate LOI (%).
    - Across CS programs, 1978 method used for CS2007 to maintain comparability with CS2000 and CS1978 datasets.
  - Quality control for LOI
    - Each batch includes standard material and a duplicate; reported good repeatability and precision.
  - Bulk density (BD)
    - Up to 3145 cores analysed; BD derived from core dimensions and masses, with moisture content and stone corrections.
    - Uses LOI-derived moisture protocols; acknowledges lack of a single control soil but uses cross-checks (e.g., expected BD by soil type, comparisons with CS2000/2007).
    - ISO 11272:1998 method referenced but CS-specific adaptation used.
  - Olsen-P
    - Up to 1280 samples (from original 256 squares, 5 x-plots per square).
    - Extraction: 5 g air-dried, sieved soil with 100 ml 0.5 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.5).
    - Phosphorus quantified colorimetrically (molybdenum blue) with a Skalar analyser; dialysis step to mitigate reagent effects.
    - Quality control considerations: drying can affect extractable P; extraction conditions (temperature, soil:solution ratio) must be consistent.
    - Quality control for Olsen-P
      - Replicate analyses plus one standard soil and one certified reference soil per batch of 25 samples; match extraction procedure to CS2000.
  - Total Nitrogen (N)
    - Up to 1280 samples; measured by CEH Lancaster using UKAS-accredited SOP3102.
    - Instrument: Elementar Vario-EL elemental analyser; combustion in excess O2; CO2 and N2 detection with calibration via acetanilide standard.
    - Sample weights: typically 15 mg (peat) or 15–60 mg (mineral soil).
    - Quality control for N
      - Two in-house reference materials analysed with each batch; QA conforming to Defra/NERC/BBSRC Joint Codes of Practice.
  - Land classification and site descriptors
    - LC07 and LC07_NUM link soil measurements to ITE Land Classification 2007.
    - COUNTRY, COUNTY07, EZ_DESC_07 provide geographic context and environmental zone descriptions.

- Quality assurance and governance
  - Quality assurance framework: Defra/NERC/BBSRC Joint Codes of Practice.
  - Data provenance and cross-checks
    - Methods cross-checked or reanalysed if issues identified; cross-lab comparisons performed where necessary.
  - Documentation and reproducibility
    - Detailed soil manual and technical reports underpinning all laboratory and field procedures (CS Soils Manual and associated technical reports).
  - Acknowledgement and rights
    - All CS data usage must acknowledge Countryside Survey data owned by NERC - CEH; rights reserved.

- Sampling strategy and study design
  - Nationally representative sampling plan
    - Great Britain stratified into Land Classes across environmental gradients to ensure representative national statistics.
  - Sample layout and numbers
    - 591 sample squares in 2007 (289 England, 107 Wales, 195 Scotland).
    - Sampling design adapted from earlier surveys; 0-15 cm soil samples collected in 1978, with subsequent surveys (CS2000 and CS2007) refining sampling geometry (e.g., from the western corner of Main Plots in 2007).
  - Power analyses
    - Conducted pre-2007 to ensure sufficient samples for reporting across major habitats and countries; some analytes with reduced sample sizes still meet required confidence levels.

- Data management, archiving and documentation
  - Protocols and data management
    - Field and lab processing protocols documented; archiving practices described; data manipulation procedures outlined in the Soils Manual.
  - Access and references
    - Key publications: Countryside Survey Soils Manual (2008), Countryside Survey: Soils Report (2010), UK Results from 2007 (2008), and related Land Classification references.
  - Data outputs and usage
    - Outputs include soil pH, LOI-derived carbon metrics, bulk density, moisture, nitrogen, Olsen-P, and phosphorus and their spatially distributed statistics for Great Britain.
    - Data designed for integration with other environmental datasets to monitor soil health, carbon stocks, and nutrient status over time.

- Endnotes and additional resources
  - CS2007 Soils Manual (Emmett et al., 2008) provides sampling strategy, QC, archiving, and data manipulation details.
  - Links and DOIs provided in the referenced materials for deeper methodological context and historical comparability.

- Practical implications for environmental monitoring
  - Enables time-series comparisons of soil health indicators (pH, SOM via LOI, nutrient status, carbon stocks) across GB.
  - Facilitates data integration with other Countryside Survey datasets and external environmental information for policy evaluation and monitoring of environmental health trends.
  - Emphasises standardized procedures and rigorous QA to ensure data reliability for downstream analyses and policy scrutiny.
