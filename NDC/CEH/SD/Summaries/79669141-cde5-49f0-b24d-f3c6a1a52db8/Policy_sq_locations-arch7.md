# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of survey square locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## CS Partners (as of policy)
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveying, environmental integrity, and ongoing permission from landowners.
- Confidentiality supports continuing ability to inform environmental policy.

## When locations may be released and precision levels
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence to help identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only considered in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may preprocess data to avoid release, and the requesting organization must demonstrate comparable or higher confidentiality protection for their IP.
- Spatial data from within survey squares could reveal square locations and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.
  
## Specific conditions of release
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite; data must not be retained beyond project needs.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards equivalent to JCOP when applicable.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same IP confidentiality level as six-digit releases.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations or to claim such derivations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences (for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data) with clauses reflecting policy; licences must be signed by a senior authorized person.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decisions under applicable Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS partnership use, CEH strives to provide pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be through collaboration or payment, depending on the arrangement.
