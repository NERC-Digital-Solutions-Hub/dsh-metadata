# Soil Core Sampling Protocol

- Purpose
  - Standardise soil core collection to produce high-quality, traceable data for downstream analysis and data products (e.g., datasets, reports, dashboards).

- Equipment
  - Electric Cold Box (kept cool via vehicle power)
  - Mains charger for accommodation
  - 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs of pliers, mallet
  - Regular and long thin trowels, notebook & pen
  - Spare cores (for damaged cores)
  - X-plot core packs (cores, end caps, labelled bags) and stamped mailbags
  - Notes: use for labeling, cooling, and transporting samples; follow temperature and handling requirements to preserve sample integrity

- Sampling design and targets
  - Square configuration: five soil sampling locations per square
  - Core types and locations (per X-plot)
    - Core C: Black core, 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter, located 15 cm south of the centre-quadrat corner
    - Core F: Short White core, 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter, located 15 cm east of Core C; maintain litter layer
    - Core N: White core, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter, located 15 cm south of Core C (30 cm from south corner of centre quadrat)
    - Core P: Long Grey core, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter, located 15 cm west of Core C; orientation with bevelled end up
  - Composite soil sample (SQID): 8–10 sub-samples from around the 5 m quadrat boundary, to a depth of 15 cm, mixed to fill a single bag
  - Problem notes: record issues (e.g., large roots, cow pat, boulders) and adjust sampling point if necessary to obtain homogenous samples

- Core collection procedures (net steps)
  - Prepare: clear surface vegetation; choose correct core for position
  - Core insertion: hold pipe upright, cut bottom edge if needed, push into soil
  - Depth and leveling: press grey/black plastic plate onto pipe and hammer to level with soil surface
  - If depth insufficient or pipe damage occurs: move sampling point or use spare pipe
  - Extraction: twist/pull pipe slowly to avoid soil loss; use trowel as needed
  - Cleaning: scrape off exterior soil; trim bottom end if needed
  - End caps: place caps on pipe ends; seal sample in its bag
  - Documentation: note any issues in the envelope (e.g., “large tree roots”)

- Composite sampling (SQID)
  - Expose soil surface; insert long thin trowel to create a 15 cm deep square along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat
  - Collect 8–10 sub-samples; place into the same bag
  - Ensure each side has representation (at least 2 samples per side)

- Storage and dispatch (per-core handling)
  - Core C (Black): bag, then store with other Black cores in a spare plastic bag; keep cool in vehicle box until return to regional coordinator
  - Core F (Short White): bag in larger bag with other F cores; store in cool box; after five samples, send in mailbag to CEH Lancaster
  - Core P (Grey): bag with other P cores; store in cool box; send in mailbag to CEH Lancaster
  - Core N (White): bag with other N cores; store in cool box; send in mailbag to CEH Bangor
  - Soil Sample Bag (composite): place in cool box; mail to CEH Lancaster
  - General rule: keep samples cool and away from direct sunlight until dispatch

- Posting and timing
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - Do not post on Friday; if last post is Thursday and cannot post same day, store in cool box over weekend and post on Monday
  - If closest post box is unsuitable, use an alternate Post Office
  - Use OS map data or Road Atlas to locate Post Offices

- Data capture and traceability considerations
  - Maintain precise sampling locations relative to centre-quadrat (for each square) and core type identifiers (C, F, N, P)
  - Use consistent labeling and sequencing to enable linking of each core to its square and plot
  - Record sampling anomalies and any vegetation or ground condition deviations to support data cleaning and interpretation
  - Ensure proper chain-of-custody through labeled bags and mailbags to designated CEH facilities

- Alignment with data-use goals
  - Procedures produce well-documented, labeled, and climate-controlled samples suitable for downstream analyses
  - Standardised methods support reproducibility, data merging across plots, and creation of user-friendly data products and dashboards for exploration by end users
