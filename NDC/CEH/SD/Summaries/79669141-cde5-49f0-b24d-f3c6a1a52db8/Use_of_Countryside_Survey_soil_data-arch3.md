# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Purpose
  - Document sampling design, power analyses, and protocols for soils in the Countryside Survey (CS) to support monitoring, evaluation of policy, and informing future decisions.
  - Provide guidance on data collection, analyses, and data management to ensure quality and comparability across years.

- Sampling design
  - Soils sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007. 
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to 591 CS squares.
  - Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Samples taken from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 x-plots randomly spaced.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to land-use and soil-type heterogeneity.
  - Some x-plots are relocated over time due to plot destruction, access issues, or relocation uncertainty.
  - Each sampling location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) linking to a known location within a square.
  - Cores are collected from 2–3 m around the corners of a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

- Sampling methods
  - Top 15 cm of soil sampled in 1998 and 2007 (8 cm for invertebrates); cores hammered in and extracted.
  - In 1978, soil pits were used to sample the top 15 cm.
  - Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken in 2007 for some cores.
  - Some soils could not yield a full core due to stones or shallow soil.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1990 onwards: soil mapping; multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements per core.
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples homogenised before analyses.
  - 2007: bulk density measured (not via ISO core method); core dimensions and photographs recorded; various chemical and physical measurements across cores (e.g., pH, %C, %N, moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, etc.).
  - Data coverage varied by core type and year; some measurements applicable to all 591 squares, others only to subset (see table references).

- Statistical analysis and interpretation
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes can bias estimates of stock/change.
  - Bootstrapping not always used; recommended approach is to use a mixed model with square as a random factor to handle multiple x-plots per square.
  - Design-based approaches (dispersed, broad spatial placement) can improve precision and regional estimates when spatial structure is not of primary interest.
  - Users of CS soils data are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review publications exploiting the data (listed on the CS website).

- Data governance, access, and metadata
  - Emphasis on data quality, transparency, and sharing of underlying data where appropriate.
  - Some data were released only after the Soils Report (November 2009) (noted with asterisk in the dataset description).
  - Metadata completeness and standardization are important for reuse and cross-year comparability.
  - Data may require transformation to be usable; coordination with data originators is often necessary to verify metadata and context.

- Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates establishing long-term, standardized soil monitoring with repeatable yet flexible sampling locations.
  - Highlights the importance of documenting relocation, sampling depth consistency, and measurement scope across years.
  - Underscores the need for careful statistical framing (mixed models, land-class weighting) to derive national-scale stock and change estimates.
  - Illustrates data governance challenges, including access barriers and the requirement for robust metadata and transparent data sharing protocols.
