# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Current CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
- Confidentiality supports future surveys and reliable policy guidance.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Four-digit grid references: released under licence to indicate which 10x10 km grid squares contain CS squares.
- Six-digit grid references: released only if essential; CEH may perform pre-processing analysis to avoid release.
- Very exceptional cases: external release under licence if the requester proves IP data/models require equal/higher confidentiality; otherwise not released.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats/linear features) carry similar confidentiality and will follow the same exceptional-terms approach as six-digit references.
- Spatial data must not be used to reveal precise square locations or to visit lands or check landowner compliance.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals for the approved project.
- Licences are for finite periods and specific projects; data should not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- End-of-license: written confirmation of destruction of location data.
- No disclosure to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have a more lenient IP requirement than six-digit releases.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report on access applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS partnership use; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with CEH before committing to use data; CEH may assist in defining requirements or supporting use, negotiated per collaboration or payment.

## Practical implications for data governance and stewardship
- Implement secure handling, access control, and tight licensing for location data.
- Plan for pre-processing options to avoid unnecessary release of precise locations.
- Maintain documentation of requests, decisions, and destruction confirmations.
- Coordinate with CEH/NERC for requests, approvals, and annual reporting to ensure policy compliance.
