# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- A: The document outlines the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey through 2007, detailing how the ITE Land Classification is used to stratify GB land and guide representative sampling over time.
- B: It emphasizes the historical development of the ITE Land Classification and its crucial role in enabling national, and later country-specific, habitat estimates.

## Core concepts

- Stratified random sampling to ensure representativeness across ecological land types.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental-attribute–based typology used to define strata (originally 32 classes, later expanded and subdivided for country-specific reporting).
- Use of central 1 km squares (and surrounding squares) to build a classification framework, enabling extrapolation to national estimates.

## Data workflow and outputs

- Field survey units: 1 km squares classified by ITE Land Classes; eight or more squares per class across surveys.
- Data products: habitat/land-class area estimates, trend/change statistics, and land-class maps for each survey cycle; emphasis on enabling cross-survey comparability and country-specific reporting.
- Estimation approach: national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within a class multiplied by the total area of that class; country-unit estimates computed using squares within each country.

## Timeline and evolution of the sampling strategy

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data of 1228 central 1 km squares.
  - 256 squares surveyed (8 per class) across GB.
  - National habitat estimates calculated from class-level areas and class sizes.

- 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
  - Survey expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification and 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification updated to classify all GB squares; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat vegetation quadrats recorded; Land Cover Map linked to this phase.
  - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification and 4th Field Survey) / CS2000
  - Classification updated to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
  - All GB squares reclassified with major surrogates for climatic/geological factors.
  - Introduction of separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) and additional sampling to ensure adequate representation; uplands module added to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - Substantial expansion of sample sizes and reallocation to support country-based reporting.

- 2007 (Revised Land Classification and 5th Field Survey) / CS2007
  - Wales-only reporting requirements prompted further adjustments.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating five new Welsh/England subdivisions: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Total strata increased to 45; Wales received 43 additional squares (min 6 per Welsh class); some English classes retained with smaller per-class samples.
  - Wales becomes more intensively sampled relative to England/Scotland to support Wales-specific environmental policy needs.

## Country-specific reporting and sampling adjustments

- CS1990 and CS2000 introduced England & Wales and Scotland as reporting units, with class sub-divisions and aggregation to ensure adequate country representation.
- CS2007 further refined country-specific stratification to support Wales-only reporting, adjusting sample allocations and class definitions accordingly.
- Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates and replaced to maintain country-reporting consistency.

## Estimation and data comparability

- Across surveys, estimates hinge on the Land Classification framework and its consistency over time.
- National estimates use the formula: mean habitat area per square in each Land Class × area of that Land Class.
- For country-specific estimates, estimates are derived from squares belonging to the corresponding country unit, with sub-division and aggregation as needed to maintain balanced representation.
- Considerations noted regarding consistency when changing Land Classification between surveys; guidance favors using the latest classification for within-survey estimates while maintaining cross-survey comparability.

## Upland module and Wales reporting

- CS2000 introduced an uplands habitat module to improve accuracy for upland areas in England and Wales.
- CS2007 places greater emphasis on Wales reporting, necessitating Welsh-specific Land Class subdivisions and increased Welsh square allocations.

## Data outputs, dissemination, and references

- Main reports and country-specific results published (CS1990 main report; CS2000/CS2007 UK results).
- Land Classification maps and tables accompany outputs to support data exploration, comparison, and policy-focused analysis.

## Key challenges and considerations for data support

- Representativeness: ensuring adequate and balanced sampling across all land classes and across England, Wales, and Scotland, especially for Wales in 2007.
- Data continuity: changing Land Classification across surveys affects cross-time comparability; decisions needed on whether to prioritize within-survey consistency or cross-survey comparability.
- Patchy or evolving data: accommodating updates to land classifications while maintaining robust time-series analyses.
- Resource constraints: allocation of relatively small numbers of squares per class can limit precision, particularly in smaller countries or rapidly changing classes.
