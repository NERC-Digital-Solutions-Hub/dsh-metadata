# Sampling design

- Context and scope
  - Soils were sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007 as part of the Countryside Survey (CS).
  - 256 squares were sampled in 1978 and 1998; in 2007 soils were collected from all 591 CS squares, though not all measurements were made on all samples.
  - Power analyses informed the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and layout
  - Sampling occurs from CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to land-use and soil-type differences.
  - Some plots are relocated over time due to destruction, access issues, or relocation uncertainty.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating square and repeat plot, with sampling locations typically 2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

- Sampling methods
  - Top 15 cm of soil is sampled (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998 and 2007 used soil cores hammered into the soil; 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm.
  - In some cases, full cores could not be collected due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores.

- Measurements and data structure
  - Laboratory measurements by year:
    - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
    - 1990 (CS1990): some soil mapping.
    - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (Table 1).
    - No chemical analyses by horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
    - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not by ISO bulk density method).
  - A full description and implications are provided in Emmett et al. 2008.
  - Measurements cover a wide range of soil properties (e.g., pH, LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, etc.), with data availability varying by year and core.
  - Some measurements (notably certain variables) were released only after the Soils Report published November 2009.
  - The 2007 dataset includes measurements across all 591 squares for several variables, with some measurements limited to the original 256 squares or to specific x-plots.

- Statistical analysis and GIS considerations
  - Analyses should account for land-class structure; ignoring it can bias population stock/change estimates or yield weighted national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; recommendations favor mixed models with square as a random factor to reflect multiple x-plots per CS square.
  - CS is design-based; spatial structure is not usually the focus, and a dispersed sampling approach can improve overall precision and regional coverage.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review CS publications available on the CS website.

- Data availability and usage notes
  - 591 squares sampled in 2007; originally 256 squares in earlier years.
  - Some measurements are available only for subsets of cores or squares (e.g., 2 of 5 x-plots in each original 256 square for certain measurements).
  - Data and methodology are documented in Emmett et al. (2008) with detailed methods, analysis considerations, and protocols.
