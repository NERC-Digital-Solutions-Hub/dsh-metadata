# Sampling design

- Temporal span and scope
  - Soils sampled in the Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - 1978 and 1998 sampled the same 256 squares; 2007 sampled all 591 CS squares, though not every measurement was made on every sample.
  - Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Samples taken from CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - x-plots within a square are not replicates; they may reflect different land uses or soil types.
  - x-plots were occasionally relocated due to plot destruction, access denial, or uncertainty about location; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating square 2, repeat plot 1.
  - Location references correspond to the same site within ~2–3 meters, as sampling occurs around the 2m x 2m plot corners.

- Sampling details
  - Samples collected from the top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998 and 2007 used soil cores hammered into the soil; 1978 used a soil pit.
  - In some soils, full cores could not be collected due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements were taken for 2 of 4 cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and datasets
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990s onwards: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (Table 1).
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizons; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI analyses.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method due to core requirements).
  - Data release notes: some measurements (marked with an asterisk) released only after the Soils Report published November 2009.
  - Measurements catalogued include: pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, and other core-specific measurements (e.g., mineralisable N).

- Data scope and coverage
  - 2007 dataset includes measurements across all 591 squares for several variables; some measurements were only on the original 256 squares.
  - Table 1 (referenced) details which measurements were made on which cores and squares.

- Statistical analysis and design considerations
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields population stock/change estimates rather than weighted national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; the CS design emphasizes mixed-model approaches.
  - Recommended model: include square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within each square (up to five per square).
  - For CS, only one core per location is typically taken; design-based approaches favor dispersed observations to improve regional estimates, even when spatial structure is not the primary interest.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and interpretation and to review related CS publications.

- Data usage guidance
  - Full methodological context is provided in Emmett et al. (2008): Countryside Survey Soils 2007 – Method development, power analyses and protocols.
  - Data access and related publications are listed on the CS website; coordination with CEH is encouraged for analysis planning and interpretation.
