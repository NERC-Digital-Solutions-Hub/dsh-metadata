# A1.1.1. Equipment

- A field kit for soil core sampling and shipment, including:
  - Electric Cold Box (kept cool by vehicle charging)
  - Vehicle mains charger for accommodation
  - 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs of pliers, mallet, regular trowel, long thin trowel
  - Notebook and pen, parcel tape, spare cores
  - Pack for X-plots with cores, end caps, and labelled bags
  - Stamped and addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

- Purpose for GIS work:
  - Ensures sample integrity, traceability, and proper documentation for subsequent geospatial analysis and data integration.

## GIS Data Capture and Metadata

- Study design context:
  - 120 squares sampled; each square contains X-plots with five soil sampling locations (including a composite sample) and a defined 5 m quadrat boundary.
- Spatial references and identifiers:
  - Each X-plot has labeled bags and mail bags; samples linked to square, X-plot, SQID, and center quadrat.
  - Core positions are defined relative to the centre quadrat (e.g., 15 cm south, 15 cm east, etc.).
- Data quality and notes:
  - Record any sampling problems or anomalies (e.g., large tree roots, cow pat, boulder) in a note envelope.
  - If a sampling point is obstructed or core breaks, use spare cores and document deviations.

## Sampling Procedures by Core Type

- Core C (BLACK): 15 cm long, 5 cm diameter
  - Locate 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner (use black core distance as reference)
  - Collect, seal in its bag, and store separately
- Core F (SHORT WHITE): 8 cm long, 4 cm diameter
  - Located 15 cm east of the black core
  - Leave litter layer intact; seal after collection
- Core N (LONG WHITE): 15 cm long, 4 cm diameter
  - Located 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner)
  - Collect, seal in its bag, and store with related N cores
- Core P (LONG GREY): 15 cm long, 4 cm diameter
  - Located 15 cm west of the black core
  - Ensure bevelled end faces the soil; collect, seal, and store with other grey cores
- Composite soil sample (SQID sample):
  - 8–10 sub-samples taken with long thin trowel along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat to 15 cm depth
  - Sub-samples combined into a single bag, filled to the top panel, then sealed in a secondary bag
  - Store with the corresponding square’s samples

## Composite Soil Sample

- Sub-sampling protocol:
  - Move vegetation as needed to access soil surface
  - Form a square 15 cm deep using the trowel; collect 8–10 sub-samples
  - Place sub-samples into a single bag; seal inside a second bag
  - Bag should fill to the top of the top white panel
- Purpose for GIS:
  - Provides a representative composite sample per SQID for laboratory analysis and spatially linked results

## Sample Storage, Packaging and Dispatch

- Immediate handling:
  - Return all four cores to the vehicle for storage
  - Core C (BLACK): keep in its bag; after all blacks for a square are collected, store together in a spare bag inside a box; keep cool and shaded
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE) and Core P (GREY): bag within a larger plastic bag; store in the cool box; after five samples, place in mailbag for CEH Lancaster and post promptly
  - Core N (WHITE) and related grey cores: store in the cool box; post in CEH Bangor mailbag after all samples for the square are collected
  - Soil Sample Bag (composite): place in the cool box immediately; then mail in CEH Lancaster bag
- Dispatch instructions:
  - Post samples as soon as possible; if not possible by the last post Thursday, place in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post on Fridays
  - If local post boxes cannot accept packages, use a convenient Post Office
  - Use OS map data or Road Atlas to locate Post Offices for posting

## GIS and Data Management Considerations

- Data alignment:
  - Link physical samples to precise spatial references: square ID, X-plot, SQID, centre quadrat, and core position (relative offsets).
- Data quality and provenance:
  - Maintain notes on any sampling issues and deviations; attach to the corresponding sample metadata.
- Packaging and chain-of-custody:
  - Use labeled bags, mail bags, and appropriate cooling to preserve sample integrity for downstream GIS-enabled analysis and lab workflows.
- Data integration:
  - Prepare for integration with other spatial datasets by standardizing sample IDs and ensuring consistent spatial referencing (quadrats, offsets, and square boundaries).

## Operational Notes and Quality Assurance

- Ensure correct core placement and labeling to prevent mix-ups (C, F, N, P).
- If a core cannot be collected as specified, document the issue and use spare cores if available.
- Reference materials for spatial planning:
  - OS map data and Road Atlas used to locate post offices and plan logistics for timely mailing.
