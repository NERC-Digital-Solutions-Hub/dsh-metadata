# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Overview
- Soils were sampled in the Countryside Survey (CS) during 1978, 1998, and 2007.
- 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to all 591 CS squares.
- Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sampling design
- Within each CS square, 5 x-plots are randomly spaced to form the sampling framework.
- x-plots are not replicates; they may differ in land use, soil type, etc.
- x-plots can be relocated over time due to plot destruction, land access, or uncertainty in location.
- Each sampling location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating square and repeat plot.
- Locations within a permanently marked 2m x 2m plot are sampled, with exact cores 2–3 meters apart across the four corners.

## Sample location and logistics
- Sampling focuses on the top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for the invertebrate sample).
- 1998/2007 used a soil core driven into the ground; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Stone-rich or shallow soils prevented full core collection in some cases.
- In 2007, core photographs and dimensional data were collected for 2 of the 4 cores.

## Sampling and measurements
- 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores had different measurements (refer to Table 1 for details).
- No chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples were homogenised before pH and LOI.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 (not by ISO bulk density method due to core constraints); implications discussed in Emmett et al. 2008.

## Measurements and data structure
- Measurements recorded across numerous variables (e.g., LOI, pH in water and CaCl2, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, etc.).
- Data availability varies by subset:
  - Some measurements available for all 591 squares in 2007.
  - Others limited to the original 256 squares.
  - Certain measurements released only after the Soils Report (Nov 2009).
- Comprehensive tables (e.g., Table 1) document which measurements were taken on which cores and which plots/squares.

## Statistical analysis and interpretation
- Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring it yields population stock/change rather than national estimates.
- Bootstrapping not uniformly used across analyses.
- Recommended approach: mixed models with square as a random factor to reflect multiple x-plots per square.
- Design-based approaches (dispersed observations) can improve regional precision and coverage when estimating regional statistics.
- Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review related CS publications listed on the CS website.

## Data quality, standards, and governance
- Data provenance and repeat identifiers enable longitudinal comparisons, despite relocations.
- Acknowledges variability in data collection methods across years (e.g., depth, core use) and the impact on comparability.
- Emphasizes need for careful interpretation given land-class structure and sampling design.
- Data release timing and documentation emphasize transparency and traceability (e.g., See Soils Report 2009 for released data).
