# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.

## Who are the CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Maintain scientific integrity of sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports the public interest by ensuring ongoing ability to inform environmental policy.

## Access and release framework
- Requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners, under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
- Release options by precision:
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to show approximate location within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing by CEH to avoid release; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may external release be granted under licence.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- Prioritised approach: prefer pre-processing by CEH to meet user needs without releasing precise locations.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality; data stored securely and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for unrelated duties.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation of data destruction and continued confidentiality.
- No third-party release that could compromise location confidentiality; no use to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar licence terms to six-digit but do not require the highest IP confidentiality criteria; a clause prevents deriving precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases following policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, with sign-off by a senior authorised official from the licensee.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision rationales.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; requests from non-CS bodies are case-by-case.
- Organisations are encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by the policy; CEH involvement may be through collaboration or payment, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for data support work
- Data professionals must understand that precise location data are tightly controlled and require CEH-led processing or licensed access.
- When feasible, use aggregated (four-digit) references or CEH-processed outputs to enable analysis without exposing exact locations.
- Coordinate with CEH early in project planning to determine feasibility and licensing needs.
- Any data product development should respect privacy, security, and licensing constraints; avoid plans that could enable pinpointing square locations.

## Next steps and contacts
- For guidance or to initiate access requests, engage with CEH (on behalf of NERC) as the primary point of contact.
- Consider pre-emptive consultation with a CEH scientific lead to define requirements and appropriate data use.
