# Sampling design

- Overview
  - Soils were sampled in CS in 1978, 1998 and 2007.
  - 256 squares sampled in 1978 and 1998; in 2007, soils were collected from all 591 CS squares, though not all measurements were made on all samples.
  - Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - x-plots within a square are not replicates due to potential variability in land use and soil type.
  - Over time, x-plots may be relocated due to plot destruction, access restrictions, or relocation uncertainty.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) corresponding to square 2, repeat plot 1.
  - Samples with the same unique identifier originate from the same location; actual sampling points are ~2–3 m apart within a permanently marked 2m x 2m plot.

- Sampling method and depth
  - Depth: top 15 cm sampled in 1998 and 2007 (8 cm for invertebrate samples); in 1978, a soil pit was used to sample the top 15 cm.
  - Core sampling: 1998 and 2007 used soil cores hammered into the soil; 1978 used pit-side sampling.
  - Some soils prevented full core extraction due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1990: some soil mapping performed.
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (see Table 1).
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method due to core requirements); full method described in Emmett et al. 2008.
  - Data availability: many measurements are listed; some data are restricted and only released after the Soils Report (November 2009).

- Measurements per core and data coverage
  - Examples of measured properties include LOI, pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, texture indicators, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and others.
  - Measurements were taken across different subsets of cores and squares (e.g., some measurements available for all 591 squares, others only for original 256 squares or a subset of x-plots).
  - The dataset includes a mix of measurements with varying coverage across years and locations; data availability is documented in the CS2007 data tables and related reports.

- Data analysis guidance and considerations
  - Analyses should consider land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock and change of the population, while including land classes yields weighted national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping was not uniformly applied across analyses; a mixed model with square as a random factor is advised to account for up to five x-plots within each CS square.
  - CS design emphasizes dispersed observations for regional estimates rather than strict spatial structure.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and to review publications that exploit the CS soils data (listed on the CS website).

- Data governance, provenance, and references
  - Method development, power analyses, and protocols documented in Emmett et al. (2008): Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols.
  - The data are associated with the Countryside Survey and summarized in the Soils Report and related CS website materials, with some measurements released only after 2009.
  - This documentation supports data stewardship, including consistent metadata, method versioning, and versioned releases tied to specific CS reports.
