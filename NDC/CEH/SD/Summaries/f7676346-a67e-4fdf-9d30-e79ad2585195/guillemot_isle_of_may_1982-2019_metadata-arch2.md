- Population metrics include breeding pairs and year-to-year changes.

## Population and reproduction metrics
- Pairs: number of breeding pairs in year t.
- Pairst-1: number of breeding pairs in year t-1.
- PopGR: rate of change in breeding numbers between years.
- N_hatched: number of chicks hatched.
- N_fledged: number of chicks fledged.
- Fled_success: proportion of hatched chicks that fledged.
- Fled_Age: mean age of chick at fledging (days).

## Chick development and condition
- Chick_Mass_N: number of chicks weighed.
- Chick_Mass_x: mean mass (g) of chicks with wings ≥ 60 mm.
- Chick_M_SEM: standard error of mean chick mass.
- Chick_growth_index: mean mass at wings ≥ 60 mm divided by mean age at fledging (days).
- Chick_lineargrowth: growth rate (g/mm) for chicks with wing lengths 25–59 mm.
- 2_adults_present: proportion of chicks with two adults present at mid-day.
- 2_adults_SE: SE of two-adult presence proportion.
- NoAdult_present: proportion of chicks with no adult present at mid-day.

## Parental effort and behavior
- Parental_effort: index of parental effort.
- PESE: SE of the parental effort index.
- Time_togther: time adults spent together after a chick was fed (minutes).
- FeedsD_1: number of fish fed to a chick in a day.
- Fish_samples: number of fish identified.

## Diet composition and energetics
- PropDiet_SE: SE of the proportion of chick diet by mass made up by sandeels.
- PropDiet_Clup: proportion by mass of Clupeidae in chick diet.
- PropDiet_others: proportion by mass of other species in chick diet.
- SE_length: mean length of a sandeel (cm).
- Clup_length: mean length of a Clupeidae (cm).
- SE_energy: mean energy value of a sandeel (kJ).
- Clup_energy: mean energy value of a Clupeidae (kJ).

## Adult survival and measurements
- AdSurvival: mean adult survival from year t to year t+1.
- AdS_LowCI: lower 95% CI of adult survival.
- AdS_UpCI: upper 95% CI of adult survival.
- Ad_M_N: number of breeding adults weighed.
- Ad_Mass_x: mean mass (g) of breeding adults.
- Ad_M_SEM: SE of the mean mass of breeding adults.

## Data quality, handling, and use
- Data understanding and processing: required data are verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed for analysis.
- Standardised analysis: data are analyzed using standardised methods to produce outputs (e.g., categories of environmental health against standards).
- Outputs and presentation: findings are presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts).
- Data management: datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to facilitate access.
- Accessibility and value: ongoing aim to increase dataset value by integrating with other relevant data and by enabling access to underlying data used to produce outputs.

## Challenges and opportunities for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Increasing the value of monitoring datasets by combining them with related data (avoiding single-use datasets).
- Enabling others to access the underlying data used to generate final outputs.
