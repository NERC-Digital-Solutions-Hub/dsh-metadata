# Economic and social science questionnaire dataset, Mambwe District, Zambia (2013)

## Aim and scope
- Dataset from 211 household surveys in Mambwe District, Eastern Zambia, examining human and animal health in the context of household wellbeing, assets, and access to resources.
- Part of a broader study on trypanosomiasis, settlement changes, and dynamic drivers of disease (DDDAC) within the DD DAC ecosystem.
- Data support research on environmental health, poverty, and policy-relevant indicators over time.

## Study design and lineage
- Semi-structured interviews conducted alongside blood sampling in people and livestock.
- Sampling frame established from a census (Aug 2012–Oct 2012); households randomly selected to meet minimum animal-owning sample and to include additional households without animals.
- Data collected on tablets (droidSURVEY), offline; daily uploads when connected; outputs anonymised and stored for ingestion into the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Sampling and sample size
- Based on a full census of 3,717 households; final sample: 211 households (144 with livestock/dogs, 67 without).
- One-stage cluster design targeting trypanosomiasis prevalence, with assumptions for prevalence, confidence, precision, and design effect.
- Household-level interviews paired with biosampling for human/animal diseases (e.g., trypanosomiasis, tick-borne infections, ASF, brucellosis).

## Data collection and instruments
- Questionnaires administered in multiple local languages (Chikunda, Chichewa); translations supported by local collaborators.
- Tablet-based data capture allowed multiple responses, grids, and open entries; offline collection with online uploads when possible.
- Data cleaning and coding performed post-collection; anonymisation included removal of respondent names and GPS coordinates; household IDs retained.

## Data management and anonymisation
- Data stored securely on servers; anonymised before transfer to Excel and CSV for ingestion into EIDC.
- Variables coded with careful recoding (e.g., multi-response items into single variables with coded letters); handling of blanks with designated codes.
- Dataset named Socio-econ_Zambia_DDDAC_2017; accompanying documentation lists variable names, definitions, and coding schemes.

## Data structure and content areas
The dataset comprises variables grouped into the following sections:
- Introduction and household identifiers
- Household information (demographics, head, households with adults/children, ethnicity)
- Education
- Health services and human health (health centre access, travel time, costs, satisfaction, health training, mortality, zoonoses knowledge)
- Water and sanitation
- Livestock and veterinary services (availability, distance, drugs, sources, treatment, prevention, vaccination, training)
- Animal production (livestock ownership, purposes, production metrics, births, deaths, movements, ownership, off-take, intake)
- Fauna/wildlife, tsetse flies and contacts with them (wildlife seen, contact with wildlife, tsetse observations)
- Crop/vegetable production (vegetation change, cotton farming, pesticide use, field proximity)
- Migration (in- and out-migration over the last decade, reasons, seasonal migration)
- Economic status/poverty (land area in limas, maize storage, assets, energy use, household wealth indicators)
- Resilience (food availability, malnutrition awareness, clubs/groups)
- Value setting (valued possessions, savings, social networks, market access, comparative indicators)

Key environmental and interface topics covered
- Vegetation change over five years and drivers (rainfall, deforestation, overgrazing)
- Human–wildlife and livestock–wildlife interactions (tsetse presence, contact zones, animals affected)
- Crop production decisions and cotton farming, including pesticide use and field proximity to households
- Migration and land-use changes linked to environment and resource access
- Water access, quality, scarcity, sanitation, and energy sources for household needs
- Household resilience indicators and market conditions for livestock and crops
- Zoonoses awareness and human/animal health interfaces (rabies, trypanosomiasis, brucellosis, malaria)

## Environment-monitoring relevance
- Integrates environmental change signals (vegetation, water resources, wildlife interactions) with health and livelihood outcomes.
- Enables assessment of policy performance on health, agricultural livelihoods, and ecosystem services (DDDAC/ESPA connections).
- Data suitable for time-series or cross-sectional analyses of human–animal–environment dynamics in rural Zambia.

## Data quality, limitations, and notes
- Language translation considerations may affect some disease and wildlife terminology interpretation.
- Sampling framed around trypanosomiasis prevalence estimates; representativeness focused on households with/without livestock.
- Data cleaning and coding required significant post-collection processing; some questions have broad or ambiguous interpretability.

## Availability and usage
- Data stored securely and prepared for ingestion into the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC); accompanying materials provide variable definitions and coding.
