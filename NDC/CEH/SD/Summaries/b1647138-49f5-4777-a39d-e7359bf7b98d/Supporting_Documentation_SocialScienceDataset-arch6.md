# Economic and social science questionnaire dataset, Mambwe District, Zambia (2013)

- A dataset of 211 household surveys conducted in Mambwe District, Eastern Zambia, as part of a broader study on human and animal trypanosomiasis and settlement patterns.
- Aims to contextualise health of people and their animals within household wellbeing, assets, and access to resources; covers demographics, health, veterinary services, livestock, wildlife interactions, agriculture (including cotton), migration, water and fuel use, assets, poverty, resilience, and ecosystem changes.
- Part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC); funded by NERC (NE/J000701/1) with ESPA support.

- Lineage and sampling
  - Semi-structured interviews in 211 households, alongside biological sampling of people and livestock for disease.
  - Sampling frame based on a full census conducted in Aug 2012 and Oct–Nov 2012; census recorded 3,717 households.
  - One-stage cluster sample designed to estimate trypanosomiasis prevalence (minimum 139 households); expanded by 50% to include more households without livestock/dogs (total 211).
  - Household selection aimed to represent both livestock-owning and non-livestock households.

- Questionnaire content and objectives
  - Dual focus on livestock/dogs and human health, with broader wellbeing indicators (wealth/poverty, assets, water and sanitation, health facility access).
  - Topics include: household demographics, health/trypanosomiasis exposure, veterinary services, livestock/dog demographics, market access, migration, crop production (cotton), ecosystem changes, wildlife contacts, and zoonoses (rabies, brucellosis, etc.).
  - Also collects data on health service access, nutrition, and household resilience indicators (assets, social networks).

- Data collection and instruments
  - Field team of four, with translation support; local languages include Chikunda and Chichewa.
  - Questionnaire administered via tablets using droidSURVEY; offline data collection with daily online updates when possible.
  - Data recorded electronically with grid/multiple-choice formats; some responses require translation and interpretation for disease concepts.
  - Blood samples collected for disease testing; household visits included both human and animal components.

- Data recording, cleaning, and anonymisation
  - Data stored on secure servers and downloaded into Microsoft Excel format; anonymisation performed after collection.
  - Thorough data cleaning described: converting responses to distinct codes, consolidating “other” replies into coded categories, removing blanks, and assigning coded variables.
  - Anonymisation steps include removing respondent names, GPS coordinates, and interviewers’ names; household numbers retained for linking within the dataset.

- Data structure and content
  - Data file: Socio-econ_Zambia_DDDAC_2017 (CSV format).
  - Comprehensive variable set organized into sections:
    - 1. Introduction and household identifiers (e.g., HH_no, head sex/age, household size, main tribe).
    - 2. Household information (adults, children, marital status, presence of livestock/dogs).
    - 3. Education (schooling, highest education level).
    - 4. Health services and human health (health facility access, travel time/cost, satisfaction, willingness to pay for better services, health/hygiene training, mortality).
    - 5. Water and sanitation (water access type, distance, quality, scarcity, toilet access, water-related beliefs).
    - 6. Veterinary/animal health (vet services availability, distance, drug availability, sources, treatment and prevention practices, vaccination, training).
    - 7. Animal production (ownership and quantity of cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs; animal births, deaths, and abortions; ownership dynamics; animal products and markets).
    - 8. Fauna/wildlife, tsetse flies, and contact with wildlife (wildlife seen, contact with animals/humans, exposure, tsetse presence/seasons/direction/distance).
    - 9. Crop/vegetable production (vegetation change, cotton farming specifics, field proximity, pesticide use, field ownership, market connections).
    - 10. Migration (mobility in last 10 years, reasons, migration during rainy season, health effects).
    - 11. Economic status/poverty (land area, maize storage, household assets and devices, energy sources, energy usage by purpose).
    - 12. Resilience (food availability, malnutrition awareness, clubs/associations).
    - 13. Value setting (ownership of valued possessions, savings, family/network changes, market conditions for livestock/crops, lifestyle changes).
  - Extensive coding schemes for responses (e.g., numerical, letter codes, and binary indicators) with explicit handling of missing or not applicable values.

- Data dictionary and coding notes
  - The dataset provides explicit variable names, definitions, and coding (e.g., HH_no, Adult_men_married_no, Water_avail_type, Vet_distance_km, etc.).
  - Coding conventions include use of numeric, letter, or symbol codes; placeholders for not applicable (\, # for not answered); and anonymised identifiers to preserve privacy.
  - Some complex questions use grid formats or multi-specification answers, with multiple variables representing each possible response.

- Access, usage considerations, and limitations
  - Data are cross-sectional for 2013; intended for integration with broader DDDAC datasets and longitudinal analyses within the consortium.
  - Anonymisation and consent procedures described; translations and local terminology present potential interpretation nuances.
  - Data collection faced a minor disruption (one day without electricity affecting tablet use); data cleaning mitigates format and coding challenges.
  - The dataset supports analyses of health, Livestock–human–wildlife interfaces, livelihood strategies, market access, and resilience under changing environmental and economic conditions.
