# Economic and social science questionnaire dataset, Mambwe District, Zambia (2013)

## Overview
- Dataset from 211 household surveys in Mambwe District, Eastern Zambia, examining human and animal health, livelihoods, and ecosystem interactions.
- Part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC); funded by NERC (NE/J000701/1) with ESPA support.
- Covers household demographics, health (human and animal), health and veterinary services access, livestock/dogs, wildlife contacts, crop production (notably cotton), migration, water and fuel use, assets, poverty, resilience, and values.
- Aimed at informing understanding of wellbeing in the context of disease dynamics and changing settlement patterns.

## Study design and sampling
- Based on 211 households selected from a census frame of 3,717 households conducted in Aug 2012 and Oct–Nov 2012.
- Sampling design: one-stage cluster survey with an initial target of 139 households for estimating trypanosomiasis prevalence; sample size increased by 50% to include more households without livestock/dogs.
- Household types: some households with livestock/dogs, others with no animals; percentage with livestock/dogs ≈ 51.2%, with 47.7% having no animals.
- Data collection window: June–August 2013.
- Blood sampling for disease in people and animals conducted alongside socio-economic interviews.
- Ethical protocol: written consent obtained prior to interviews and blood sampling.

## Data collection and processing
- Data collection team included the lead researcher; interviews required translation between local languages (Chikunda, Chichewa) and English.
- Data capture: questionnaires deployed on tablets using droidSURVEY; offline data collection with daily internet uploads; data stored securely on a server and later anonymised and exported to Excel, then to CSV for ingestion into the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- Anonymisation: removal of respondent names, GPS locations, and interviewers’ names; household numbers retained.
- Data cleaning and coding: extensive post-collection cleaning to standardise responses (e.g., converting to numeric codes, consolidating “other” responses, handling blanks with not applicable or not answered).
- Documentation: complete dataset structure and variable definitions provided in accompanying materials.

## Questionnaire content and key domains
- Introduction: household-level identifiers and basic socio-demographic questions.
- Household information: household composition, marital status, tribal affiliation, etc.
- Education: children in school, highest education level attained.
- Health services and human health: access to health centers, travel time and cost, satisfaction with services, willingness to pay for improved access, health hygiene training, mortality in the household, dog bites and rabies, malaria treatment responses, fever and diarrhoea patterns and treatment, zoonoses knowledge.
- Water and sanitation: water access type, distance/time to water sources, water quality and scarcity, toilet access, perception of epilepsy and other beliefs.
- Veterinary services (for households with livestock): availability of veterinary services, distance to facilities, drug availability and sources, common treatments, vaccination and de-worming practices, willingness-to-pay for better vet access, animal health training.
- Animal production: cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs; livestock numbers, births/deaths/aborts, animal ownership and use for traction, ownership by household members, animal health events, livestock off-take and intake, livestock sales and transfers, milk and dairy product use and treatment, disease priorities, and enterprise practices (feeding, grazing, tick control, reproduction).
- Fauna/wildlife, tsetse flies and contacts with them: frequency of wildlife seen, species, contact with wildlife by people and animals, timing and location of encounters, presence of tsetse flies and distance from home.
- Crop/vegetable production: vegetation changes, cotton cultivation, cotton-field proximity to home, who grows cotton, pesticide use, company affiliation in cotton production.
- Migration: internal moves over the past 10 years, reasons for moving, reasons for chosen areas, seasonal migration during the rains, health effects of migration.
- Economic status/poverty: land area farmed (in limas), maize storage, household assets (mobile, bicycle, vehicle, solar panel, TV, radio, plough, etc.), energy sources and usage for lighting, cooking, heating, and energy access.
- Migration and resilience sections also capture access to markets for livestock/crops, savings, family networks, and perceptions of changes over time.
- Resilience and value setting: food availability, malnutrition awareness, group/clubs membership, possessions with highest value, savings and coping ability, family network changes, livestock and crop market trends, lifestyle changes.

## Data structure and access
- Primary data file: Socio-econ_Zambia_DDDAC_2017 (CSV format) containing a comprehensive set of variables described in the questionnaire.
- Variable naming and coding: extensive coding scheme (e.g., HH_no, HH_head_sex, Educ_level_reached, Water_avail_type, etc.); many variables use numeric or letter codes for predefined categories with explicit definitions in the accompanying variable table.
- Data provenance: data were anonymised and prepared for ingestion into EIDC; dataset includes a wide range of socio-economic, health, agricultural, and environmental indicators.
- Documentation and metadata: detailed variable definitions and coding rules are provided with the dataset.

## Project context and funding
- Part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC) research program.
- Funded by UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) project NE/J000701/1 with support from ESPA.
- Authored by a multidisciplinary team: Kathrin Schaten, Alexandra Shaw, Noreen Machila, Martin Simuunza, Emmanuel Chirwa, Neil Anderson, Ewan MacLeod, and Susan Welburn.
- Acknowledgments note contributions from translators, field staff, and community sensitisation and administration teams.

## Data quality and limitations
- Translation and interpretation challenges due to multilingual context and disease descriptions represented by signs rather than discrete diseases.
- Data collection relied on tablet-based surveys; some entries allowed multiple responses and “other” categories, requiring careful recoding.
- Changes in livestock holdings between census and survey updates affected sample composition (some randomly selected households ultimately had no livestock).
- Some questions include ambiguous or broad categories; extensive data cleaning was performed to standardise responses.
- Data represent a cross-sectional snapshot (June–August 2013) anchored in a 2012–2013 sampling frame, with linkage to broader DDDAC research streams.

## Potential uses for analysts
- Explore correlations between household wealth, assets, and access to health and veterinary services.
- Model relationships among human and animal health indicators, livestock production practices, and disease exposure (e.g., trypanosomiasis, tick-borne diseases).
- Assess influence of migration, water access, and energy sources on household resilience and food security.
- Analyze the role of livestock ownership in economic status, market access, and crop production decisions (e.g., cotton farming).
- Examine wildlife contact and tsetse fly exposure in relation to livestock disease risk and human health outcomes.
- Inform policy by identifying local barriers to health service access, veterinary care, and agricultural productivity at local scales.
