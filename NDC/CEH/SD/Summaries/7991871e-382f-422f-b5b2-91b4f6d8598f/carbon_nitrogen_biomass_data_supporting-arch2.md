# Carbon_Nitrogen_Biomass_data_Supporting.docx

## Purpose and scope
- Dataset from an ex situ growth experiment to test seedling mass and carbon and nitrogen concentration in needles of birch (Betula pendula) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), using soils from forest stands that are pine-only, birch-only, or mixed (1:1).

## Study site and planting history
- Hambleton Forest, Yorkshire, UK (54°13'N, 001°07'W).
- Stands planted in 1961: silver birch–pine mixtures and monocultures; thinned in 1998 and 2003.
- Each stand is 0.2 ha with ~900 trees; mixture plots sown in a 5x5 m checkerboard pattern (25 trees per plot).

## Experimental design and sampling
- Ex situ trial conducted with soils collected on 19 September 2019.
- Ten replicate soil samples were taken from each stand type: birch-only, pine-only, and 1:1 mixed plots.
- Soils stored at 4°C and used within 5 days.
- Seedling tubes (Ray Leach Cone-tainers) prepared with three replicates per soil sample; tubes seeded to achieve: 1 pine seedling, 2 birch seedlings, or 1 pine + 1 birch seedling per tube.
- Seeds stratified; surface sterilized with 1% hydrogen peroxide.
- Growth chamber conditions: 18°C, 16 h light / 8 h dark; watering as needed; adjustments ensured maximal root coverage per tube.
- Seedlings destructively harvested between 19 and 22 weeks after germination.

## Measured variables and materials
- Shoots dried at 60°C; roots stored for future analyses.
- Measurements include:
  - mass_g: dry mass of individual seedlings (roots and shoots)
  - foliar_CN_ratio: foliar carbon-to-nitrogen ratio
  - %C: foliar carbon concentration
  - %N: foliar nitrogen concentration
  - myc_status: ectomycorrhizal status on roots (Myc vs NM)

## Data organization and format
- Data structured in columns with the following headers:
  - Plot_replicate
  - Stand (Pine, birch, or mixed)
  - Tube_content (Pine only, birch only, or mixture)
  - Seedling (pine or birch)
  - Replicate
- Recorded fields include: foliar_CN_ratio, mass_g, myc_status, %N, %C.
- When a tube contained the same species, data reflect the average across harvested seedlings in that tube.

## Analytical relevance and potential use
- Enables assessment of how soil origin and stand composition influence seedling growth and tissue elemental composition, including mycorrhizal associations.
- Data suitable for comparison across monoculture and mixed-stand soils within an environmental monitoring framework and for integration into broader analyses of forest stand interactions and nutrient dynamics.
