- Relevance for GIS work
  - Produces a 3D voxel dataset (2000^3) with explicit voxel size in millimeters, suitable for 3D spatial visualizations and volumetric analysis in GIS workflows.
  - Spatial scale is defined in consistent units (mm with scaling to per-meter outputs), enabling integration with GIS coordinate frameworks after appropriate georeferencing.
  - Detailed projection geometry, region specification, and center-of-rotation data support accurate spatial reconstruction and mapping of internal structures into map-based visualizations.
