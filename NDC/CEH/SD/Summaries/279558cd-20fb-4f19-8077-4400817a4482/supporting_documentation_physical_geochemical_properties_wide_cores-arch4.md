# Physical and geochemical properties of saltmarsh soils produced from 33 wide diameter gouge cores spanning 19 UK saltmarshes collected between 2018-2021

## Project context and purpose
- Project: Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE); funded by NERC (NE/R010846/1).
- Aim: quantify physical and geochemical properties of saltmarsh soils to calculate organic carbon burial rates across UK saltmarsh ecosystems.
- Research team: multidisciplinary collaboration across several UK universities and institutes.

## Data collection and locations
- Samples: 33 wide-diameter gouge cores (60 mm) from 19 UK saltmarshes.
- Collection period: 2018–2021.
- Spatial coverage: UK saltmarshes with site locations provided in decimal degrees (WGS84); included Scotland, England, and Wales to represent varying sediment types and organic carbon content.
- Location data formats: latitude/longitude and X/Y (easting/northing); elevation above ordnance datum (m).

## Variables and content
- Site and sample identifiers: Core_ID, Saltmarsh, Marsh_type, Marsh_zone, Nation, Collection_year.
- Spatial variables: Lat_dec_deg, Long_dec_deg, X_easting, Y_northing, Elevation_above_OD__m.
- Sediment description: Substrate (Troels-Smith classification), sample_depth_cm, mid_point_depth_cm.
- Physical properties: Wet_bulk_density_g_cm_3, Dry_bulk_density_g_cm_3.
- Geochemical properties: OC_perc (organic carbon content), N_Perc (nitrogen content), CN (carbon:nitrogen), NC (nitrogen:carbon).
- Isotopic measurements: d13C_per_mil (δ13C_org), d15N_per_mil (δ15N).
- Data file: physical_geochemical_properties_wide_cores.csv with a detailed column schema.

## Sampling and laboratory methods
- Core collection: 60 mm gouge corer; cores described in the field using Troels-Smith scheme.
- Location recording: DGPS for precise site positioning.
- Preservation: cores frozen at -20°C until analysis.
- Sub-sampling: cores sectioned in 1 cm intervals (n = 1952 sub-samples).
- Carbon analysis: total organic carbon measured with Elementar Soli TOC (temperature-gradient method) following DIN 19539 standards; calibration with CaCO3 and soil standards.
- Isotope analysis: OC and N quantified; δ13C_org and δ15N measured using EA-IRMS after carbonate removal via acid fumigation for carbonate-free analyses; analyses conducted at James Hutton Institute.
- Calibration and QA: use of standard reference materials (high OC sediment standard, B2151); routine analysis of standards to ensure accuracy; all laboratory equipment calibrated per institutional practices.

## Data management and format
- Data format: CSV (physical_geochemical_properties_wide_cores.csv).
- Metadata: includes core IDs, site descriptions, geographic coordinates, depths, substrate, density, elemental and isotopic compositions.
- Data descriptors: accompanying resource description defines field formats (text vs. numeric) and unit conventions (e.g., g cm^-3, % wt., ‰).

## Data quality, limitations, and governance
- Quality control: isotope and TOC measurements include standard calibration and repeat analyses; isotope analyses include carbonate removal to ensure accurate OC and isotopic values.
- Limitations: data cover 19 sites across the UK within similar environmental regions for comparability; some fields labeled NA where not applicable.
- Documentation completeness: detailed methodological references provided to support reproducibility and future methodological updates.

## Relevance for data strategy and reuse
- Use cases: supports cross-site comparisons of carbon stocks and burial rates in UK saltmarshes; provides standardized physical, chemical, and isotopic baselines for intertidal carbon storage studies.
- Interoperability: standardized Troels-Smith substrate classifications, depth intervals, and QA procedures facilitate data integration with other UK saltmarsh or marine sediment datasets.
- Collaboration and continuity: dataset generated by a large multi-institution team; clearly defined data collection and analysis protocols support potential expansion to additional sites or time-series data.
- References for context and methods: includes foundational methods and calibration references (e.g., Troels-Smith, DIN 19539, Harris et al. 2001, Natali et al. 2020; Smeaton et al. 2021).
