- Aim and context
  - Part of the Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE) project; funded by NERC (NE/R010846/1).
  - Dataset used to calculate organic carbon burial rates across UK saltmarsh ecosystems.
  - 33 wide-diameter gouge cores from 19 UK saltmarshes collected between 2018 and 2021.

- Data resource and content
  - Data Resource ID: Physical and geochemical properties of saltmarsh soils produced from 33 wide diameter gouge cores spanning 19 UK saltmarshes collected between 2018-2021.
  - Dataset: Physical and geochemical measurements derived from 33 cores to support carbon burial rate estimates.
  - Data format: CSV (Physical_geochemical_properties_wide_cores.csv) with detailed column definitions.

- Locations and sites
  - Geographic scope: United Kingdom (Scotland, Wales, England).
  - Spatial data: Site coordinates provided as decimal degrees (WGS84) and also as X_easting and Y_northing.
  - Site descriptors include Saltmarsh name, Marsh_type (Natural or Realigned), Marsh_zone (Low or High), Nation, and Collection_year.

- Variables observed
  - Geospatial and site-level: Core_ID, Saltmarsh, Marsh_type, Marsh_zone, Nation, Collection_year, Lat_dec_deg, Long_dec_deg, X_easting, Y_northing, Elevation_above_OD_m.
  - Sub-sampling and depth: Sample_depth_cm, Mid_Point_depth_cm.
  - Substrate and bulk density: Substrate (Troels-Smith classification), Wet_bulk_density_g_cm_3, Dry_bulk_density_g_cm_3.
  - Organic and nitrogen content: OC_perc, N_perc, CN (C/N), NC (N/C).
  - Stable isotopes: d13C_per_mil (δ13C_org), d15N_per_mil (δ15N).

- Sampling and laboratory methods
  - Field sampling: 33 cores collected using a 60 mm gouge corer; cores logged with Troels-Smith descriptions; location recorded by DGPS.
  - Sample processing: Cores cut into 1 cm sections (n = 1952); samples frozen at -20°C until analysis.
  - Carbon and nitrogen analyses: Sediments milled to a fine powder; ~50 mg analysed for total organic carbon (TOC) using a Soli TOC analyzer with a temperature-gradient method (DIN 19539; Natali et al., 2020; Smeaton et al., 2021).
  - Isotope analyses: Approximately 12 mg per sample for OC and δ13C_org and 12 mg for N and δ15N; carbonate removal by acid fumigation (for silver capsules) prior to isotopic analysis; analyses performed with EA-IRMS at James Hutton Institute.
  - Calibration and QA: TOC calibration with CaCO3 and silty soil standards; isotopes quality-controlled via repeat analysis of high OC sediment standard (B2151); laboratory calibration against CaCO3 and standard soils (B2290) and relevant standards; QA aligned with standard laboratory practices.
  - Data quality notes: Statistical treatment indicated as NA; data checks performed per laboratory practices.
