# Supporting documentation for the experiment manipulating local population density

- Study location and subjects: Wytham woods, Oxfordshire, UK; great tits, blue tits, marsh tits, and nuthatches; winter-spring 2021 (January–March).
- Experimental design:
  - Eight sites total, each with two feeders ~100 m apart; six experimental sites and two control sites.
  - Selective feeders recording visits via RFID/PIT tags; feeders programmed to restrict access to specific individuals to manipulate local density.
  - Pre-experiment phase: ~2 weeks of open access to all PIT-tagged birds; measured baseline visitation.
  - Density manipulation: at three experimental sites high-density feeder vs low-density feeder determined by pre-experiment visitation; at the other three experimental sites the density roles swapped.
  - Randomization: within birds observed at least 100 times during the pre-experimental period, 20% assigned to the low-density treatment and excluded from accessing the high-density treatment.
  - Duration: six-week manipulation period; feeders checked and refilled every 2–3 days.
- Data collection and sources:
  - Collectors: Keith McMahon, Sam Croft, Kristina Beck.
  - Data captured: each bird visit to a feeder logged with date, time, and logger (feeder).
  - Additional metadata: experimental site, period (pre/during), treatment per logger (low/high/c1/c2 for controls), treatment per individual (id.treatment), and species code (Bto.species.code; greti, bluti, marti, nutha).
- Data structure and schema:
  - Single CSV file containing:
    - Bto.ring (unique PIT tag)
    - Site (experimental site identifier)
    - period (pre/during)
    - treatment (per logger: low/high/c1/c2)
    - id.treatment (per individual: low/high/control)
    - Bto.species.code (greti, bluti, marti, nutha)
  - This structure enables linking visits to specific feeders, sites, and density treatments.
- Spatial considerations for GIS:
  - Data collected at discrete feeder locations across eight sites, with two feeders per site, enabling spatial mapping of visits and density effects.
  - Potential GIS workflows: map feeder locations, join visits to site polygons, analyze spatial patterns by species and treatment, and assess temporal dynamics.
- Data quality, limitations, and notes:
  - Data depend on RFID/PIT tag detections; potential gaps if loggers fail or access control misfunctions.
  - Resolution limited to feeder-level observations within chosen sites; may require careful cleaning to harmonize period and treatment fields.
  - Pre- and during-experiment phases differentiate context for analyses of density effects.
