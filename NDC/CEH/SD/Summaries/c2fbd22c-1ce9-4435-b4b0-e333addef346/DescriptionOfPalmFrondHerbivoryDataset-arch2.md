# Experimental design / sampling regime

- Study location and plots
  - Three oil palm estates in Riau Province, Sumatra, Indonesia: Ujung Tanjung, Kandista, Libo (Pt Ivo Mas Tunggal)
  - Planting years ranged 1987–1995 (mature/over-mature on Ujung Tanjung and Kandista; Libo replanted in 2014)
  - 18 plots established in 2013 as part of the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in Tropical Agriculture (BEFTA) project
  - Each plot: 50 × 50 m with ~50 m separation from access tracks on three sides and ~1000 m to the fourth side
  - Palm sampling positions: three per plot at edge points at 45°, 165°, and 285° from north
- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Population: BEFTA core plots (mature stands) and replanted stands
  - Sampling frequency: herbivory measured every 3–4 months from 2013 to August 2017 (total 18 time points)
  - Palm selection: three palms per plot randomly chosen from numbered palms
  - Measurements: herbivory damage to the palm crown estimated visually; 18th frond chopped, photographed, and analyzed
- Methods for measuring herbivory
  - Leaflet sampling: 20 leaflets (in 10 pairs) along the 18th frond, evenly spaced; photographed from a fixed position and setup by the same photographer
  - Image processing and damage assessment
    - Photos pre-processed to remove noise; leaflets analyzed in Fiji to measure total leaflet area
    - A second image "filled" to represent intact leaflets; missing tips conservatively estimated
    - Percent damaged area calculated as area consumed by herbivores
  - Damage categorization
    - Leaflets categorized into damage classes 1 (no damage) to 4 (heavy damage)
    - For each image, recorded the number of leaflets in each damage class
- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Percentdamagephotos: percent of damage within the 20 photographed leaflets (from image analysis)
  - Count: number of leaflets in the recorded damage class
  - Additional metadata fields
    - Estate_abbrev, Triplet, Plot, Treatment (reduced, normal, enhanced), Period, PalmNumber, Date
    - PercentTotalDamageEye: observed total crown damage by eye
    - PercentFrondEye: damage on the 18th frond by eye
    - PercentDamagePhoto: damage as percent from photo analysis
    - Abunclass: damage class label
    - distance: distance to an exclosure (within 20 m; related to ant poison experiments)
- Data quality control
  - Basic checks for impossible values
  - 50% data entry cross-checks against field sheets with <1% error rate
  - All changes documented and retained with the dataset
- Format and storage of data
  - Three separate CSV files (thin format: each row is a single observation; percentage data repeated across rows)
  - Metadata headers and descriptions included for each column
  - Data distinguishes mature-stand plots from replanted-stand plots
- Data structure and key variables
  - Triplet, Plot, and PalmNumber identifiers to locate observations
  - Date of observation and Period (discrete sampling intervals)
  - Treatment and Period used to analyze management effects over time
  - Distance column for exclosure proximity (note: data may be inappropriate for analysis when within an exclosure)
- Miscellaneous
  - Funding: NE/P00458X/1
  - Datasets include BEFTA core plots (2016–2017) and replanted plot data
  - Plot coordinates and naming conventions provided (for traceability and mapping)
