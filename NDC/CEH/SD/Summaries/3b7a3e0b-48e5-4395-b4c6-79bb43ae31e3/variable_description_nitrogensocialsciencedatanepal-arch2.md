# Harmonised Household Survey on NUE and Sustainable Nitrogen Practices (SANH WP 1.3)

## Purpose and scope
- Provides harmonised, cross-country household-level data to assess nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and sustainable nitrogen practices.
- Captures farmer attitudes, decision-making, inputs, and enabling factors affecting NUE across Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
- Structures data to support environmental monitoring, policy performance, and cross-seasonal comparisons through standardized outputs (reports, charts, maps) and data portal uploads.

## Data design and scope
- Cross-sectional design with seasonal snapshots (two seasons per year) to capture temporal variation.
- Data collected at multiple levels: household, farm, plot, and crop, with extensive variable codings and codes for season, crop, input sources, subsidies, and outputs.
- Nationally aligned within the SANH framework (WP1.3) for cross-country comparability.

## Key data domains and variables
- Labor and wages
  - Labor times by activity (season 1 and season 2, and multiple later seasons), segmented by Household Members (HM) and HIRED LABOUR (HL); includes detailed activities like land preparation, seed, weeding, planting, fertilizing, transplanting, water management, harvesting, and others.
  - Total labor hours (e.g., N610TotalS12, N610TotalS21, etc.), wage estimates (N631–N639 for HM HL wages across seasons), and counts of laborers by sex (N621 MaleS1, N622 FemaleS1, etc.).
- Mechanization
  - Level of mechanization for key activities across seasons (N681 LandprepS11, N682 SeedS11, N683 FertilizerS11, N684 IrrigS11, N685 Harvesting1, etc.).
  - Related costs and usage indicators (N69WCOSTS11, N69WCOSTS12, etc.).
- Irrigation and water management
  - Access to irrigation, irrigation activity, water source, pricing mechanisms, and payments (N71AcessS11, N72DIrrigateS11, N74WaterMgtS11, N75PuddleS11, N76SourceS11, N77WPricingS11, N78PayS11, N79SourceS11; and repeated across seasons 12, 21–24).
  - Proportions of crop area irrigated, water management methods for rice, puddling decisions, and water source types (groundwater, surface water, rainfall).
- Fertilizers and manure
  - Decisions on synthetic vs organic fertilizer use (N1081–N109 Keeprecordfertilizer) and cross-season continuity (N1081–N1094; N109Keeprecordfertilizer1–4).
  - Attitudes and perceptions about fertilizer use, soil fertility, yields, runoff, environmental effects, and risk tolerance (N122–N127, N123–N128 series).
  - Information sources and decision-support usage (N1–N7 FertInfo..., N104 Fertinforank, N1101–N1107 Decision support tools).
  - Records of fertilizer use and yields (N101 Keeprecordyield1–4).
- Pesticides and integrated pest management (IPM)
  - Pesticide use presence (N81UsePesticideS1), types (N82 Whattypeofpesticides), application frequency (N83–N85), and IPM adoption (N86 UseIPMS1; and repeated across seasons).
- Subsidies and inputs
  - Direct subsidies related to synthetic fertilizer, agricultural machinery, irrigation, output price support, seed, and others (N151–N156).
- Information access and advisory influence
  - Sources of fertilizer guidance (N2–N7 FertInfo...), frequency and reliability of information, reasons for non-use, and adoption of suggested practices.
- Attitudes, risk, and decision-making
  - Individual readiness to try new technologies, risk tolerance (N121, N122, N126), beliefs about soil fertility, fertilizer/manure effects on yield and environment (N127 series), and decision-making processes (N1081–N109Keeprecordfertilizer).
- Demographics and household characteristics
  - Household composition, assets, expenditure patterns (N1311–N13299; N141–N149), education, landholdings, assets, housing, utilities, and access to services.
- Expenditures and assets
  - Monthly and annual expenditure categories (food, electricity, fuel, transport, telecom, education, health, taxes, festivals, durable assets, etc.) and ownership of assets (TVs, smartphones, internet access, power tillers, irrigation pumps, etc.) across multiple years/seasons (N1311–N13299; N141–N149; N410 onward).
- Crop codes, water, and irrigation specifics
  - Crop codes and season-specific crop data (CropcodeLABS11, CropcodeIRRGS11, etc.) to enable linking labor, input use, and water management to specific crops and seasons.
- Subset and miscellaneous indicators
  - Enumerator notes and miscellaneous variables for data quality and context (Numerous EnumeratorsnoteP… sections).

## Temporal and geographic details
- Season coding and cross-season tracking (e.g., 11, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24) to enable seasonal analyses and cross-country comparability.
- Crop and input data aligned to seasons for NUE and environmental monitoring across SANH partner countries.

## Outputs, monitoring, and policy relevance
- Variables are designed to support standardized outputs (reports, maps, charts) for evaluating environmental health, NUE, and policy performance over time.
- Data are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals to promote reuse, transparency, and scrutiny.

## Analyst considerations and opportunities
- Track NUE indicators, input intensity (fertilizer, pesticides), and water-use efficiency across seasons and countries.
- Assess subsidies and information access on adoption of sustainable nitrogen practices and their environmental outcomes.
- Link household and farm-level practices with external environmental datasets (water quality, soil health, emissions) for integrated policy analysis.
- Leverage standardized coding to enable reproducible, cross-country comparisons and trend analyses over time.

## Challenges and opportunities
- Managing a large, complex, multi-country, multi-season dataset with extensive variable coding.
- Ensuring cross-country comparability and data quality across seasons and crops.
- Balancing granular detail (e.g., per-activity labor hours, input costs) with the need for scalable environmental monitoring outputs.
