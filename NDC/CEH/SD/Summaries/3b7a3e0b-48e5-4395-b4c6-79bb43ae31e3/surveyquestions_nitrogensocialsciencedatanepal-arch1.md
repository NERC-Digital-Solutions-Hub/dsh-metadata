# SANH WP 1.3 Harmonised Individual Questionnaire

- A harmonised survey instrument designed to collect cross-country data on agricultural nitrogen management and related household/farm characteristics.
- Integrates household demographics, farm characteristics, crops and inputs (synthetic/organic), labor, irrigation, pests, livestock, information flow, adoption, attitudes, expenditures, wealth/assets, and subsidies.
- Aims to enable identification of patterns, drivers, and potential impacts of actions on nitrogen use, with emphasis on data quality, provenance, and discoverability.

## Purpose, scope and data governance

- Collects detailed, standardised data to support analysis of nitrogen management decisions, fertilizer practices, input-output balances, and environmental outcomes across smallholders.
- Employs harmonised instruments (crop codes, seasonal timing, metadata) to support cross-country comparability and integration with nitrogen-related analyses.
- Ensures explicit consent, clear data sources, and metadata management; datasets and metadata may be uploaded to portals for discoverability and reuse.

## Section 9: Livestock

- For a set of species (Cattle, Buffalo, Yak, Cattle-buffalo hybrid, Goat, Sheep, Horse, Camel, Pig, Poultry), captures:
  - Species ownership in the past 12 months (may be multiple species per household).
  - Reasons for raising each species (11 options, including revenue, home milk/meat, ceremonies, dowry, transport, animal power, etc.).
  - Counts per species (and the species with the highest livestock units on the farm as a reference point for certain questions).
  - How animals left the farm in the last 12 months (sale, barter, slaughter for sale/household needs, disease, theft, old age, etc.).
  - Weeks (or time) animals spent in different housing types:
    - L1: Whole days in yard
    - L2: Open animal house
    - L3: Closed animal house
- Section 9 is structured to support analysis of livestock contribution to inputs (e.g., manure) and potential environmental outcomes, with multiple species data enabling stock-level aggregation.

## Section 10: Information Sources

- Assesses exposure to crop demonstrations/trainings in the last 2 years, and whether trainings covered fertilizer and manure use.
- Captures sources of information and advice used for fertilizer decisions (family, traders, extension, government, media, internet).
- Measures barriers to information, use of decision-support tools, and whether respondents keep written records of fertilizer use and yields.

## Section 11: Adoption – Drivers and Barriers

- Identifies practice/technology awareness and current adoption status.
- Examines whether participants have ever adopted and then dis-adopted specific practices.
- Includes a country-customisable list of practices (e.g., decision support tools, green manure, agroforestry, anaerobic digestion, midseason drainage, foliar fertilizer) and allows addition of country-specific practices.
- Captures drivers and barriers influencing adoption decisions.

## Section 12: Attitude, Behaviour, Perception and Opinion

- Assesses general openness to new technologies and risk attitude (e.g., willingness to try, risk tolerance on potentially profitable changes).
- Explores what could drive changes in fertilizer use (quantities, sources, timing) and perceived benefits/risks of synthetic vs. manure use.
- Includes Likert-scale items on soil/crop management beliefs, environmental and nutritional considerations, and trade-offs between fertilizer types and farm productivity.
- Covers decision-making prompts, information needs, and perceptions of limits/benefits of increasing input use.

## Section 13: Household Expenditure

- Collects average monthly expenditures across categories (food, clothing, education, health, taxes, festivals, social expenditures, durable/assets, debt, etc.).
- Notes that average food cost includes both own-production and purchases, capturing total household financial demand and resource allocation.

## Section 14: Household Wealth/Asset

- Captures ownership and characteristics of housing and utilities (house ownership status, number of rooms, flooring, lighting, cooking fuel, water source).
- Assesses access to ICT and electricity (TVs, smartphones, internet, power tiller, irrigation pump, money transfer via mobile/computer).
- Documents credit access, loan history for farm investments, loan sources, and distance to financial institutions.
- Includes crop insurance status and relevant seasons, as well as asset/land-related questions (e.g., crop codes and seasons).

## Section 15: Subsidy

- Records receipt of direct subsidies in the past 12 months, with categories including synthetic fertilizer, agricultural machinery, irrigation charges, output price support, seeds, and others.
- Enables analysis of subsidy exposure and potential impacts on farming decisions and nitrogen-related practices.

## Key analytical opportunities for Analysts

- Link livestock data (species, counts, manure flows) with fertilizer practices to model nitrogen balances and environmental risk.
- Analyze adoption patterns and drivers to identify policy levers for improving nitrogen-use efficiency.
- Examine information-source effectiveness and training impact on fertilizer/manure management choices.
- Assess the relationship between household wealth/assets, access to credit, and adoption of nitrogen-relevant technologies.
- Explore regional/local data gaps and harmonisation needs, leveraging cross-country comparability for broader inferences.
