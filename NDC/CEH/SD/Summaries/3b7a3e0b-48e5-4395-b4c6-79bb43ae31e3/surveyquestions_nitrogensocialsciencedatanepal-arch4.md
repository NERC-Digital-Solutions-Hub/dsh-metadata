# SANH WP 1.3 Harmonised Individual Questionnaire

- Purpose of Section 9 (Livestock)
  - Collect detailed, per-species livestock ownership, management, flows, and housing to support farm-system analyses and nitrogen management insights.
  - Structured to capture species diversity, husbandry rationale, and movements across the past 12 months.

- Section 9: Key data elements (Livestock)
  - Species owned (e.g., Cattle, Buffalo, Yak, Cattle-buffalo hybrid, Goat, Sheep, Horse, Camel, Pig, Poultry) with emphasis on ownership for a minimum of 1 month in the past 12 months; multiple species allowed.
  - For each species:
    - Reasons for keeping: revenue generation, home/sales milk, meat, festivals, coping with revenue fluctuations, dowry, transport, racing, draft/animal power, etc.
    - Counts: number of animals owned (with emphasis on identifying the species with the highest livestock units).
  - How animals leave the farm (for the species with the highest livestock units):
    - Options include sale (live), slaughter (for sale or household use), barter, given away (e.g., dowry), illness-related death, theft, old age/natural death, disease.
  - Housing and time-use for the most numerous species:
    - Weeks spent in different housing contexts: yard, open animal house, closed animal house (with indicators for each).
  - Data design purpose:
    - Enables calculation of livestock units, animal movements, and housing conditions to support broader farm-energy/nitrogen-use analyses.

- Section 10: Information sources
  - Tracks engagement with crop demonstrations/trainings in the last 2 years; whether trainings covered fertilizer/manure use.
  - Practices for seeking advice when handling fertilizers; ranked information sources (family/neighbors, fertilizer traders, extension agents, government, print media, radio/TV, internet, etc.).
  - Barriers to using more information; use of decision-support tools (government guidelines, private company guidance, apps, leaf colour chart, soil testing).
  - Practices around record-keeping for fertilizer use and yield; decision processes for fertilizer decisions.

- Section 11: Adoption – drivers and barriers
  - Assesses awareness, current use, and dis-adoption of selected practices/technologies (e.g., decision support tools, green manure, agroforestry, anaerobic digestion, midseason drainage, foliar fertilizer).
  - Country-specific additions possible by partners to capture local practices.

- Section 12: Attitude, behaviour, perception and opinion
  - General attitude toward new technologies and risk tolerance in decision-making.
  - Probes on what could change fertilizer use (quantity-focused) and beliefs about the benefits/risks of synthetic fertilizer vs manure.
  - Evaluates perceived impact of manure and fertilizer on soil fertility, harvest quality, and environmental considerations.
  - Includes attitudes toward learning new practices, weather dependence, and broader soil/crop management perspectives.

- Section 13: Household expenditure & income
  - Captures average monthly expenses across categories: food, clothing, education, health, taxes, festivals, investments/savings, debt, and other miscellaneous items.
  - Notes that average food cost includes self-produced consumption and purchased foods.

- Section 14: Household wealth/asset
  - Assesses home ownership, housing characteristics (rooms, floor material), lighting, cooking fuel, drinking water sources, and household assets (TVs, smartphones, internet).
  - Inventory of productive assets (power tiller, irrigation pump) and finance-related aspects (loans, access to financial institutions, crop insurance, loan conditions, distance to banks).
  - Includes indicators on transport ownership, livestock/poultry, and likelihood of crop insurance uptake.

- Section 15: Subsidy
  - Records direct subsidies in the past 12 months for various inputs and supports (synthetic fertilizer, agricultural machinery, irrigation charges, output price support, seeds, and others).

- Data governance and quality considerations for Data Leaders
  - The livestock module is highly granular and harmonised across species, designed for cross-country comparability and longitudinal tracking (season-based modules, standardized coding).
  - Emphasizes data discoverability, metadata clarity, and reusability for nitrogen management analyses.
  - Highlights potential data quality risks (recall bias for past activities, inconsistent coding across sections, need for clear ownership and consent, and updates to reflect changes in standards).
  - Governance needs include clear data ownership terms, consent and confidentiality, and post-project data destruction policies where applicable.
