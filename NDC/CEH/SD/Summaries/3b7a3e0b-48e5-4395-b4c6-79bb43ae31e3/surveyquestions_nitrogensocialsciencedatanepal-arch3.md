# SANH WP 1.3 Harmonised Individual Questionnaire

## Aim
- Identify environmental health measures to scrutinise and evaluate policy, and inform future decisions.
- Designed for use by enumerators to collect household-level data to support nitrogen management and broader environmental health monitoring.

## Survey Design and Coverage
- Harmonised household-level instrument funded by UKRI.
- Purposeful to identify measures informing policy scrutiny, evaluation, and future decisions.
- Administered by enumerators; interview length around 50 minutes; can pause/resume; no participant compensation.
- Respondents: primarily the head of the household or a suitable household member with farming responsibilities.
- Two-season framework: data collected for Season 1 and Season 2 to capture temporal variability.
- Broad domain coverage across demographics, farm characteristics, plots, crops, inputs, labour, irrigation, pests, yields, and governance.

## Data Domains and Key Variables (illustrative)
- Section 1: Household Characteristics (head identity, age, gender, farming experience, education, household composition).
- Section 2: General Farm Characteristics (homestead size/tenure, cropping area, cropping intensity, management practices).
- Section 3: Plot Characteristics (plot size/tenure, rental payments, plots linked to target crops).
- Section 4: Crop Production & Harvest (crops/varieties, seeds, inputs, ownership shares, harvests, residues, sales).
- Section 5: Fertilizer Use (synthetic and organic fertilizers; quantities, costs, application, timing; irrigation linkage; compost/manure).
- Section 6: Labour (time use by household vs hired labour; gender, wages, mechanization, animal power).
- Section 7: Irrigation (access, sources, water pricing, costs, rice-specific practices).
- Section 8: Pesticides (types, application frequency, costs; IPM adoption).
- Section 9: Livestock (see below for detailed livestock section).
- Section 10–15: Additional domains covering information sources, adoption drivers/barriers, attitudes and perceptions, expenses, wealth/assets, and subsidies.

## Data Collection Process and Governance
- Standardised coding and structured prompts (e.g., crop codes, fertilizer types) to support harmonisation.
- Enumerator-guided prompts to ensure accuracy (e.g., multiple crops per plot, seasonal variation, units of measure).
- Data governance embedded in consent: confidentiality, data-use limitations, ethical handling.
- Emphasis on two-season data to support policy-relevant monitoring and trend analysis.

## Interoperability, Coding, and Metadata
- Use of standard crop codes and fertilizer classifications; photos of fertilizer types to aid categorisation.
- Clear units and measurement conventions to support cross-study comparability.
- Rich metadata potential via explicit section mapping to enable integration with monitoring frameworks focused on nitrogen management and environmental health.

## Potential Uses for Monitoring Nitrogen Management and Environmental Health
- Estimation of nitrogen input intensity and fertilizer mix (synthetic vs organic) at farm/plot levels.
- Evaluation of fertilizer sourcing, costs, application methods, and timing for efficiency and policy interventions.
- Monitoring of crop residues, compost production, and organic inputs as components of soil health and nutrient cycling.
- Analysis of irrigation practices and water-use efficiency, pricing mechanisms, and resource management implications.
- Monitoring adoption drivers/barriers and socio-economic context (income, subsidies, expenditures).
- Integration with environmental health indicators such as emissions proxies, soil health, and climate resilience.

## Practical Considerations for Monitoring Framework Authors
- Rich, multi-domain instrument requires robust data governance, clear metadata, and interoperability standards.
- Depth yields policy-relevant insights but increases respondent/enumerator burden; consider phased deployment or sampling.
- Ensure enumerator manuals and pre-tests accompany the instrument to maintain consistency.
- Leverage harmonised structure to compare nitrogen management practices across regions and over time.

## Section 9: LIVESTOCK ( illustrative overview of livestock module)
- For each species owned in the past 12 months (may include multiple species):
  - Examples of species: Cattle, Buffalo, Yak, Cattle-buffalo hybrid, Goat, Sheep, Horse, Camel, Pig, Poultry, etc.
  - For each species: reasons for keeping (e.g., revenue, home consumption of milk/meat, ceremonies, dowry, transport, animal power).
  - For the species with the highest livestock units: how animals left the farm in the last 12 months (sale, slaughter, given away, etc.).
  - For the dominant species: weeks spent in different housing/yard conditions (yard, open animal house, closed animal house) across the past 12 months.
- The module is designed to capture per-species dynamics, turnover, purpose, and housing patterns, enabling cross-species comparisons and integration with broader environmental-health indicators.

## Section 10: INFORMATION SOURCES
- Attendance at crop demonstrations/trainings in the last 2 years; whether trainings covered fertilizer/manure use.
- Questions about sources of information used for fertilizer decisions (family, traders, extension agents, government, media, internet, etc.).
- Barriers to information uptake (availability, reliability, timeliness, awareness).
- Use of decision-support tools (e.g., leaf colour charts, soil tests, apps) and how decisions on fertilizer quantities are formed.
- Recording of written records for fertilizer use and yields, and decision-making processes around information usage.

## Section 11: ADOPTION - DRIVERS AND BARRIERS
- Practices/technologies tracked (e.g., decision support tools, green manure, agroforestry, anaerobic digestion, mid-season drainage, foliar fertilizer, etc.).
- For each practice: whether respondents have heard of it, whether they currently use it, and whether they have ever dis-adopted the practice.
- Country- or program-specific additions possible for practices.

## Section 12: ATTITUDE, BEHAVIOUR, PERCEPTION AND OPINION
- General attitudes toward technology adoption and risk-taking in decision-making.
- Attitudes toward fertilizer use and manure, including perceived benefits/risks, and importance of manure use for farm productivity.
- Perceived constraints and drivers for changes in fertilizer use, including readiness to experiment and dependence on weather.
- Additional prompts to elicit deeper beliefs about soil management, environmental considerations, and economic trade-offs.

## Section 13: EXPENSES
- Average monthly household expenditures across categories (food, clothing, education, health, housing, electricity, transport, communications, festivals, debt, savings, etc.).
- Enumerator notes specify inclusion of both production-derived consumption and purchased goods.

## Section 14: HOUSEHOLD WEALTH/ASSET
- Housing ownership status and characteristics (rooms, flooring, lighting, cooking fuel, drinking water source).
- Household assets (TVs, smartphones, internet access, power tiller, irrigation pumps, transport assets, money transfers).
- Access to credit and loans for farm investments; distance to financial institutions.
- Crop insurance status and potential compensation in the event of crop failure.
- Crop code and season code fields used for linking insurance/seasonal data.

## Section 15: SUBSIDY
- Direct subsidies received in the past 12 months (country-adjustable): synthetic fertilizer, agricultural machinery, irrigation charges, output price support, seeds, and others.
