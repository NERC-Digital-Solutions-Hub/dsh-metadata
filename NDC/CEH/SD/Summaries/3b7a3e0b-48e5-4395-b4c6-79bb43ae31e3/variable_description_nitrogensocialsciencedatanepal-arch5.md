# SANH WP 1.3 Harmonised Household Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - A harmonised household survey to compare differences in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and sustainable nitrogen practices, capturing farmers’ attitudes, opinions, and decision-making related to NUE and farm factors that influence adoption.
  - Part of a broader, cross-country initiative across Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (two-season data collection; harmonised coding and metadata to support cross-country analyses).

- Data collection framework
  - Units: Household and individual level; in-person data collection.
  - Timeframe: Cross-sectional design with data collected over two seasons (seasonal blocks).
  - Geographic and sampling approach: Multi-country, multi-district sampling designed to yield cross-country comparability while preserving country- and region-specific detail.
  - Data content: Extensive coverage across domains including household/farm characteristics, plots, crops, inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, subsidies), labor, information sources, subsidies, expenditures, assets, and subsidies.

- Data structure and metadata
  - Highly detailed, multi-section structure with repeated blocks to cover seasons and crops (examples of sections: Household Characteristics, General Farm Characteristics, Plot Characteristics, Crop Production & Harvest, Fertilizer Use, Pesticides, Labor, Irrigation, Sub subsidies, Subsidy, etc.).
  - Variable dictionaries and codes (e.g., Crop codes, SUBS vs FUL for subsidies, crop-season flags) designed for cross-season and cross-country analyses.
  - Rich documentation accompanying the data (questionnaires, enumerator notes, procedures) to support reuse and interpretation.
  - Repeated-season and longitudinal constructs: Season 1, Season 2 blocks for labor hours, wages, mechanization, irrigation, crop practices, etc., enabling comparative analyses across time.

- Data governance, privacy, and sharing
  - Governance emphasis on harmonisation and interoperability to enable cross-country use and comparability.
  - Privacy considerations: dataset contains location and household identifiers (country, state/province, district, village, household IDs). Requires de-identification and aggregation or careful data-sharing agreements to protect respondent privacy.
  - Provenance and metadata: strict need to preserve data provenance by linking variables to survey sections, seasons, and crop codes; comprehensive data dictionaries and crosswalks recommended to enable cross-country use.
  - Access and licensing: clear data-use licenses, user guides, and example analyses recommended; include data management plans with storage, versioning, and change control.

- Data quality and lifecycle
  - QA and validation: documented quality assurance processes during collection (spot checks, paper checks, back checks, data-transfer checks) to ensure accuracy and consistency.
  - Data lifecycle: emphasis on audit trails, QA documentation from collection to processing, and maintaining interoperability across countries and seasons.
  - Challenges monitored by Data Stewards: incomplete user needs, timely data submission, ensuring standard metadata across countries, managing large multi-format datasets, and adapting to diverse systems.

- Practical implications and primary uses
  - Enables cross-country analyses of NUE and adoption of sustainable nitrogen practices at household and farm levels.
  - Facilitates examination of drivers and barriers to adoption, information sources, subsidies, crop choices, fertilizer use (synthetic and organic), labor patterns, and expenditures across two seasons.
  - Supports policy evaluation, nutrient management research, and benchmarking across countries and seasons with attention to variation by crop, plot characteristics, tenure, and household socioeconomic factors.

- Specific considerations for Data Stewards (top-priority actions)
  - Data standardisation and interoperability: maintain harmonised variable naming and coding across countries and seasons; provide crosswalks for deviations.
  - Metadata completeness: ensure the data dictionary covers all sections, variables, coding schemes (crop codes, subsidy indicators, fertilizer types, seasonal flags) and guidance for repeated-section variables.
  - Data quality and auditability: preserve QA documentation and maintain audit trails; monitor inconsistencies across seasons (e.g., plot areas, crop codes, fertilizer quantities).
  - Usability and governance: implement clear data-use licenses, user guides, and example analyses; develop data management plans with storage, versioning, and change control.
  - Privacy safeguards: implement appropriate de-identification strategies for geographic and household identifiers; guide on aggregation levels for sharing.
  - Handling complexity: provide cross-country crosswalks and explanations for any country-specific adaptations or deviations; ensure formats and metadata are interoperable across all countries and seasons.
  - Practical outputs: structure outputs to support cross-country analyses of NUE, adoption drivers and barriers, subsidies, input use, and labor patterns—facilitating policy-relevant insights.
