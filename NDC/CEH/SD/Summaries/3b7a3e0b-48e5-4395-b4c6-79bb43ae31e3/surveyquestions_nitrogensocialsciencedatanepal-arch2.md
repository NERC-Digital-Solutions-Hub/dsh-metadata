# SANH WP 1.3 Harmonised Individual Questionnaire

## SECTION 9: LIVESTOCK

- Data scope
  - Capture livestock ownership for a minimum of 1 month in the past 12 months; multiple species can be present.
  - Species typically include: Cattle, Buffalo, Buffalo hybrid, Yak, Goat, Sheep, Horse, Camel, Pig, Poultry (with multiple species tracked per farm).

- For each owned species
  - Record the stated reasons for keeping the animals (e.g., generate revenue, milk for home or sales, meat for home, festivals/ceremonies, coping with revenue fluctuations, dowry, transport, racing, animal power/draft, etc.; and an “Other” option).
  - Collect the number of animals (per species) and any notes on turnover or counts (e.g., fields labeled 9.1–9.4.9.1 in the instrument).
  - Identify how animals leave the farm in the past 12 months (e.g., sale of live animals, barter, slaughter for sale, household consumption, sickness, given away/dowry, theft, old age/natural death, disease-related death).

- Highest livestock units
  - Section notes that questions 9.5–9.7 pertain to the species with the highest number of livestock units on the farm, including:
    - How those animals left the farm.
    - How many weeks in the past 12 months those animals spent in different housing contexts (L1: yard, L2: open shelter, L3: closed shelter).

- housing and duration details
  - For the dominant species on the farm, capture duration in various housing settings over the past year (whole days in yard, open animal house, and closed animal house).

- Data structure and prompts
  - The instrument uses repeated blocks per species with prompts for counts, movement, and housing days.
  - Includes a variety of species-specific prompts and follow-ups to facilitate harmonised cross-country data.

- Analytical relevance for environment monitoring
  - Enables estimation of livestock-related nitrogen inputs (via manure and urine) and their spatial/temporal patterns.
  - Supports understanding of animal housing’ role in emissions, nutrient cycling, and potential environmental health impacts.
  - Provides context for policy evaluation on livestock management, waste handling, and agricultural productivity.

- Implementation considerations for analysts
  - Maintain consistency in species coding and definitions of livestock units across contexts.
  - Prepare for multi-species data collection to minimize missing or inconsistent counts.
  - Integrate Section 9 data with other environmental modules (e.g., manure management and fertilizer use) for comprehensive nitrogen balance assessments.
  - Use GIS or spatial analysis where possible to map livestock density and housing arrangements for environmental monitoring.
