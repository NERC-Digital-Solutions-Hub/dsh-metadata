# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Sets out confidentiality rules for survey square locations and spatial data within squares to protect sampling integrity and landowner goodwill, while enabling public-interest use of CS data.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners
- Maintain scientific integrity of sampling strategy and future surveying permissions
- Protect environment and enable ongoing contribution to environmental policy

## When and how locations may be released
- Allowed to identify squares within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) with four-digit grid references under licence (approximate locations)
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) may be released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, requiring CEH processing to avoid direct release, and demonstrating equal or higher confidentiality for IP than CS data
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats/linear features) carry similar confidentiality and can be released only under the same exceptional terms
- Four-digit releases have more permissive terms than six-digit releases

## Specific licensing conditions
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals for the project
- Licences are for finite periods; data must not be retained beyond the project
- End-of-license destruction confirmation required in writing
- No release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to monitor individual landowners within squares
- If requested, demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP
- Four-digit releases require less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations or to claim such derivations

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH acts on behalf of NERC to approve exceptional releases and issue hardcopy licences
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised to bind the licensee organisation
- Denied approvals follow the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 processes
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising applications, decisions, and grounds
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing analysis support for CS partnership needs; external requests handled case-by-case
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data to help define requirements and use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case

## Practical steps for researchers and organisations
- Consult CEH early to define requirements and assess feasibility
- If pursuing precise locations, prepare justification showing IP/confidentiality considerations
- Expect formal licensing with clear terms, usage, and destruction obligations
- Plan for potential pre-processing analysis to minimize exposure of exact locations

## Public data scope
- All data other than survey square locations and internal spatial data within squares are publicly accessible.
