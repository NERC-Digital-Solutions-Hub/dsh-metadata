# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- It applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential

- Survey square locations are kept confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality protects the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Future surveys rely on these elements; disclosure could compromise policy-relevant outcomes.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations may be released

- Location data can be released to help identify whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10x10 km grid) can be released under licence for such uses.
- Six-digit grid references are only allowed in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; applicants must show that the requested data or accompanying IP is as confidential as CS data, and CEH may process data to avoid release.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitats, linear features) can potentially reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release

- Licencees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are time-limited and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- At licence end, organisations must confirm data was secure and destroyed.
- Data should not be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; if in doubt, consult CEH.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licencees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equal to the JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality.
- The licence clause prohibits attempts to identify precise square locations or to claim such identifications.

## Responsibilities and process

- CEH (on behalf of NERC) makes decisions on exceptional releases and issues hard-copy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by a senior signatory from the licensee organisation.
- If a release is denied, CEH will follow Act and Regulation procedures to support the decision.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for potential users

- Partners and potential users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to data covered by this policy.
- CEH may participate in collaborative work or support use of the data for a fee, with terms negotiated case-by-case.
