# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of survey square locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and continued access/permission from landowners.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Access can identify whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10x10 km grid square) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit (precise) locations are released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH can perform pre-processing to avoid releasing locations when possible.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-terms framework.
- Exceptional access requires demonstration that IP data to be used alongside CS data has equal or higher confidentiality/protection than CS data.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- At Licence end, licensees must confirm data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to inform planning visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the highest IP-confidentiality criteria.
- License terms include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise square locations or to claim such derivation.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
- CEH issues hard-copy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with policy clauses; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decisions.
- Moderate internal demand for pre-processing analysis; CEH aims to support partner organisations accordingly; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be beneficial to define requirements or support appropriate use (collaboration or payment arrangements negotiable).
