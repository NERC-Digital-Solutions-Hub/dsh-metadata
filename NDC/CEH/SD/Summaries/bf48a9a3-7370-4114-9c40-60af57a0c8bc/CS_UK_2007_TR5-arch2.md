# Countryside Survey 2007: Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey

- A nationwide field protocol for monitoring freshwater environment health in GB, integrating headwater streams and ponds with standardized data collection and digital data entry to support policy scrutiny and environmental health assessment over time.

## Scope and Aims

- Re-survey of headwaters across CS2000 squares (425 squares) and full pond assessment within CS2007 squares containing ponds.
- Priorities:
  - Headwaters: macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey – RHS, 2003 version), aquatic plant community (MTR), physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Ponds: macrophyte survey, physical characteristics, water chemistry, pond boundary and drawdown, pollution indicators, surrounding land use, amenity value.
- CS2007 aims to integrate multiple freshwater body types and enable national-scale comparisons.

## Survey Design and Sampling

- Headwaters (CS2007 CS squares):
  - All 425 CS2000 squares re-surveyed for headwaters.
  - Sampling involves a 500 m watercourse reach for macroinvertebrates and RHS; a 100 m aquatic plant survey within this reach.
  - In 25 of the 425 squares, a new sampling site on a smaller watercourse is added to replace unsuitable CS2000 sites.
- Ponds:
  - In CS2007 squares containing ponds, one pond per square is selected as the survey pond.
  - Pond boundary mapped, pond area estimated, drawdown height measured, and water presence (turbidity) assessed before disturbance.
- Data capture systems:
  - RHS data entered in the field using RAPID (Tablet PC-based RHS data entry).
  - Aquatic plant survey data entered in IRIS (field data entry).
  - Macrophyte data linked to the same square/pond and lab confirmation where needed.

## Headwaters Methods (In-Field Procedures)

- Macroinvertebrate sampling:
  - Use a standard 25 cm2 pond-net (900 µm mesh) for a 3-minute kick sample plus 1 minute of manual search.
  - Sample area is a single continuous stretch (5–15 m typically) with proportional sampling across habitats.
  - Collect and preserve samples in a labeled container with fixative (4% formaldehyde target; typically 40% formalin to achieve ~4% final).
  - Avoid spates; minimize cross-contamination by thorough net cleaning between sites.
- Water chemistry:
  - On-site readings for conductivity and pH (Hanna Combi meter) and a single indicative sample for SRP, TON, and alkalinity (filtered).
  - Filtration using disposable 0.45 µm filters; strict labeling and sample handling routines.
- Site environmental data:
  - Record width, depth, velocity, substrate, hydraulics, and surrounding habitat for the entire sampling area on RIVPACS Sample Area Form.
  - Capture photos of sampling area and key features for relocation.
- Macrobenthos handling and data:
  - Retain most organisms in the sample for lab identification; avoid removing fish/amphibians unless necessary, returning them promptly if observed.
  - Detailed labeling and storage protocols to prevent sample degradation and cross-contamination.
- RHS (River Habitat Survey):
  - 500 m long RHS centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site; 10 spot-checks plus vegetation and extra substrate data; RHS indices calculated per Environment Agency 2003 version.
  - Data entered in RAPID; on-site validation and data checks before leaving site.
- Aquatic plants (MTR):
  - 100 m macrophyte survey around the macroinvertebrate site; record presence and cover (nine-category scale) for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species.
  - Collect specimens for lab confirmation when necessary; use standard identification guides and caution with rare species.
- Data capture and validation:
  - RAPID validates RHS data; IRIS validates aquatic plant data; both require on-site checks and final confirmation before leaving.

## Pond Condition Methods (In-Field Procedures)

- Pond mapping and survey setup:
  - Identify the survey pond within the square from the CS2000 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet.
  - Define the outer pond boundary and sketch the pond, noting inflows, land use, and access.
  - Calculate pond area from a mapped boundary and pace measurements; determine drawdown height and proportion of water present relative to full winter level.
- Chemical and physical measurements:
  - Water turbidity estimated visually; water chemistry sampling for SRP/TON/Alk and a separate pH/conductivity readout.
  - Sampling of contaminated flows avoided near inflows; transparency and clarity recorded.
- Macrophyte survey:
  - Survey all aquatic macrophytes within the outer pond boundary (100 m equivalent area in many cases) including submerged, floating, and emergent species.
  - Macrophyte abundance recorded (Dominant to Rare) and total cover for submerged, floating-leaved, emergent species; shade from overhanging vegetation recorded.
  - Specimens collected for uncertain identifications; provided with detailed labeling and submission instructions to Pond Conservation for taxonomic confirmation.
- Documentation and labeling:
  - Use CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets for water quality, environmental survey, and macrophyte survey; include GPS location, square/pond codes, date, and surveyor details.
- Transport and sample handling:
  - Samples transported with proper TREM card labeling; CEH Dorset processes macroinvertebrate samples; plant specimens returned to Pond Conservation or processed as required.
- Pond-specific quality and safety considerations:
  - Safe access, risk awareness for pond edge and water conditions; two surveyors collaborate to minimize risk.

## Data Management and Quality Assurance

- On-site digital data capture reduces transcription errors and enables validation while in the field (RAPID for RHS; IRIS for aquatic plants).
- Field survey check-lists ensure completion of tasks; quality control includes standardization of methods, periodic audits (approx. 7%), and team rotations to maintain consistency.
- Documentation and specimen handling guidelines, including TREM transport cards, minimize sample degradation and environmental risk.

## Equipment and Logistics

- Comprehensive equipment lists provided (safety, field gear, sampling nets, GPS, maps, cameras, etc.) with per-team allocations.
- Health and safety provisions include life jackets, waders, field first aid, and risk assessment for each sampling site.
- Transport and storage: macroinvertebrate samples stored in CEH-approved containers, transported in labeled boxes to CEH facilities as per schedule.

## Outputs and Utility for Analysts

- Generates standardized, comparable ecological health data across GB freshwater networks.
- Integrates macroinvertebrate (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (RHS), aquatic plants (MTR/IRIS), and water chemistry data for holistic environmental health assessments.
- Enables longitudinal trend analysis and policy evaluation by providing consistent, auditable datasets and geospatially aligned survey sites.
