# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose
  - Maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data for the public interest.
  - Minimise the risk to future surveys and the anonymity of survey site locations.
  - Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- Partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England (NE)
  - Welsh Government (WG)
  - The Scottish Government (SG)
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
  - Forestry Commission (FC)
  - Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
  - Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

- Why locations are confidential
  - Preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
  - Confidentiality supports the ability to inform environmental policy in the future.

- Release circumstances and precision level
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to identify general location within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Six-digit grid references released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing analyses to avoid release.
  - Spatial data within squares (habitats, features) could reveal square locations and thus are subject to the same exceptional-release terms.
  - Any release must be licensed and conditioned to protect confidentiality.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other duties after expiry.
  - End of licence: written confirmation that data were secure and have been destroyed.
  - No data to be given to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases: use restrictions similar to six-digit releases, plus a clause preventing attempts to derive precise locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, decides on exceptional releases following these principles.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licenses for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
  - Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
  - If approved or denied, CEH supports the decision under relevant Acts and Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and rationale.
  - Internal use requests should be supported by CEH within reasonable timeframes; external requests handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data; CEH may provide support as collaboration or paid service, negotiated case-by-case.
