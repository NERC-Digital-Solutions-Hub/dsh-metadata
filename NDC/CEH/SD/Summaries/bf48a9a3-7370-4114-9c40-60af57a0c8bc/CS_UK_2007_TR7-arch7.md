# Countryside Survey: Ponds Report from 2007

- Provides Britain-wide assessment of pond extent, condition, and biodiversity, based on a 1 km2 sampling framework with GIS-based pond mapping.
- Key metrics: pond numbers, turnover, physical/chemical condition, plant-based biodiversity, PSYM quality, and landscape context.
- Data foundation for policy, catchment management, and GIS data products (distribution, connectivity, quality indicators).

## Pond Numbers, Turnover and Replacement

- Total pond stock in 2007: approximately 478,000 ponds in Great Britain (about 2.1 ponds per km2).
- Turnover (1998–2007): ~18,000 ponds lost; up to ~70,600 new ponds created; net increase ~12.5% GB.
- A real net gain of about 53,000 ponds (~1.4% per year) after adjusting for methodological changes.
- Pond size: ~70% of ponds are 25 m2 to 400 m2; <1% are 1–2 ha.
- New ponds (1998–2007) tend to be smaller; larger gains occurred in England and Wales, Scotland smaller.

## New vs Lost Ponds and Biodiversity

- Within CS data, both lost and gained ponds had above-average species richness and supported uncommon species.
- Some locally uncommon species in newer ponds were typical early colonisers; lost ponds hosted species associated with more mature sites (e.g., Fat Duckweed, Great Yellow-cress).
- Limited data prevent broad generalisations about replacement; gains and losses broadly similar in number and quality, but community types lost were not fully replaced by new pond assemblages.

## Pond Physical, Chemical and Landscape Context (2007)

- Weather context: 2007 wetter than 1996, reducing pond drying; seasonality varies with hydroperiod.
- Seasonal and drawdown: mean drawdown ~12 cm; England shows larger draws than Scotland.
- Water quality: geography-driven pH and conductivity; nutrient pressures indicated by SRP and TON; England shows higher exceedances than Wales/Scotland.
- Clarity: England ponds more turbid; Wales/Scotland clearer.
- Degradation indicators: 23% with physical evidence of pollution; road runoff and field drains prominent.
- Inflows/outflows: roughly half with inflow, ~46% with outflow; about one-third with inflows but no visible outflow.
- Surrounding land use (0–5 m and 0–100 m buffers): England dominated by trees; Wales improved grassland; Scotland bog/marsh in near areas; intensive land use surrounds about two-thirds of English/Welsh ponds.
- Adjacent waterbodies: 67% have wetlands within 100 m; higher incidence in Scotland.
- Tree shade: average overhang ~17% of pond area; England ~27% shade; Scotland ~2%.
- Pond management: evident in ~20% of ponds; more common near urban/fishing areas.
- New ponds: 16 identified (11 England, 5 Scotland); tend to have richer plant communities and higher PSYM scores than older ponds; about 24% reach Good PSYM/priority status; many new ponds in landscapes with substantial intensive land-use; only ~6% had semi-natural surrounds (all in Scotland).
- Lost ponds: very limited data; some high-quality ponds (priority status in 1996) lost, implying not all high-value ponds are preserved.

## Biodiversity and Biological Quality (Plant-based)

- Plant richness: 2007 CS ponds averaged 8.2 wetland plant species per pond; England trails Scotland/Wales.
- Lowland comparison (1996 vs 2007): plant richness declined from 10.2 to 8.2; reductions in emergent/submerged groups, but floating-leaved plants stable.
- Overall GB plant diversity: 205 plant species across 259 ponds (about half of GB’s wetland flora).
- PSYM results (England & Wales): NSEP ~7 vs pristine ~18; NUS ~0.7 vs pristine ~3; TRS ~8.7 vs pristine ~7.7; ~80% of CS ponds rated Poor or Very Poor; ~8% Good.
- Factors linked to higher quality: lower nutrient pollution, less intensive landscapes, fewer inflows, less shade, proximity to other waterbodies.
- Schottland PSYM not developed; where comparable, CS ponds appear relatively higher quality than English/Welsh ponds in some comparisons.

## Priority Habitats, Rare Species and Invasives

- Priority ponds (plant-based criteria and PSYM): total around 4.6% (England/Wales); Scotland contributes via other criteria.
- All-plant-criteria plus PSYM (excluding Scotland PSYM data): ~8.1% overall.
- Nationally uncommon/rare plant species recorded: 5; locally uncommon species: 43.
- Invasive species: about 10% of ponds with invasives; most common include New Zealand Pigmyweed, Least Duckweed, Nuttall’s Waterweed; higher incidence in England than Scotland.

## The Value of New Ponds and Conservation Implications

- New ponds typically richer than older ponds; 11–23 year old ponds show gains when in semi-natural surrounds, but declines in intensive landscapes.
- New ponds are more likely to be near streams; many surrounded by intensive land use; only a small fraction in semi-natural surrounds (6% overall; all in Scotland).
- Creation of new ponds increases habitat area and connectivity, potentially raising conservation value if surrounds are high quality.
- Long-term maintenance of new ponds’ biodiversity depends on land-use around them; CS 2007 suggests most new ponds are in sub-optimal surroundings for biodiversity.

## Climate Change Context

- Climate change is expected to alter pond hydroperiods (warmer, drier summers; wetter winters).
- Ponds’ vulnerability: many shallow, seasonally variable; permanent ponds at risk of shrinking if climate shifts reduce permanence.
- Creation of new ponds can offset losses by providing stable habitats and stepping stones, particularly if surrounded by high-quality land use.

## Policy Relevance and GIS Implications

- Habitats Directive and Biodiversity Action Plan: ponds contribute to Annex habitats and species; CS supports prioritisation and management.
- Water Framework Directive: CS baselines for pond condition within catchments; supports landscape-scale monitoring.
- Landscape-scale management: connectivity and semi-natural surrounds linked to higher pond quality; informs spatial planning and catchment management.
- Ecosystem services: ponds contribute to flood attenuation, nutrient trapping, and carbon storage; nutrient management and connectivity data inform service optimization.
- GIS and data products: CS demonstrates integrating pond data into GIS for policy, planning, and spatial analyses; opportunities to expand PSYM data to Scotland and incorporate invertebrate/amphibian data for richer priority-pond mapping.

## Enduring Conclusions

- Pond biodiversity and quality are generally degraded in England and Wales; Scotland shows comparatively better conditions but data gaps exist (PSYM not developed there).
- A notable boom in pond creation improves landscape-level habitat availability and connectivity, but long-term biodiversity gains depend on surrounding land use and nutrient inputs.
- Key degradation drivers: nutrient enrichment, road runoff, inflows, and increasing tree shade; landscape context and pond isolation influence resilience.
- New ponds tend to be richer and of higher quality when in semi-natural surroundings and near streams; however, most new ponds in 2007 were in intensive landscapes, risking future quality decline as they age.
- The CS 2007 dataset provides a robust geospatial framework for monitoring pond extent, quality, and policy-relevant targets, with clear potential to broaden PSYM to Scotland and to incorporate invertebrate and amphibian data for fuller priority-pond identification.
