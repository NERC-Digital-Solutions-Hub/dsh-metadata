# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data for public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality protects sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing access for surveys.

## Circumstances and levels of location release
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas ( Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references only with exceptional access, where CEH can conduct pre-processing analyses to avoid releasing exact locations; external access under licence in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances if IP/confidentiality standards are equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and will only be released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- Four-digit releases are governed by licence terms that differ in IP confidentiality requirements from six-digit releases; licenses for spatial data and four-digit references include clauses preventing use to pinpoint square locations.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to authorised individuals for approved purposes.
- Licences granted for finite periods and specific projects; data must not be retained to fulfil other organizational responsibilities.
- End of licensing: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No third-party release that could compromise square locations; data must not be used to plan visits or assess landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases are governed by similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements; licensees may not attempt to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences reflecting policy terms.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing licence applications and grounds for decisions.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analysis within reasonable timeframes; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with CEH before committing to use data under this policy; CEH may provide scientific guidance or collaborative support, with potential payment negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance
- If in doubt, consult CEH before using CS location data.
- The policy emphasises safeguarding sampling integrity while enabling controlled use of location data under strict licences and governance.
