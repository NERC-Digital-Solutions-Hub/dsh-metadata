# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Purpose: Assess uncertainty in CS2007 freshwater data to inform data quality, training, and protocols for future surveys.
- Scope: QA of field and laboratory procedures across aquatic plants, River Habitat Survey (RHS), hydrochemistry, and wetlands; baseline for CS freshwater QA.

## Introduction
- CS freshwater QA aimed to validate field surveyor expertise, laboratory procedures, and the repeatability of measurements.
- QA focused on quantifying uncertainty in data collection and processing, serving as a baseline for future surveys.

## Field Survey Methods
- Sub-sample: Random-stratified subset of 31 squares re-surveyed by an experienced CEH biologist.
- Sampling effort: 8% re-survey for streams; 7% for ponds (31 stream squares, 18 with ponds).
- Location and relocation: Re-surveys required precise re-location of 100 m aquatic plant stretches and 500 m RHS reaches, using photos, grid refs, maps, and a Tablet PC data-entry system (IRIS/RAPID).

## Aquatic Plants (Streams)
- Re-survey: 30 of 31 stream sites re-surveyed (one was dry).
- Data handling: Taxonomic standardisation and removal of terrestrial species; 29 QA sites with plant data.
- Key findings:
  - Main survey tended to record about 1.9 fewer taxa than QA (significant bias, P < 0.001).
  - Mean % taxon agreement between CS2007 and QA: 31% (100% agreement only when a single species was found in both surveys).
  - Major sources of discrepancy: misidentifications, searching thoroughness, reach location, seasonal differences, vegetation management between surveys.
  - Most missed taxa were rare (less than 1% cover); over 60% of misses were by the main surveyor (not misidentifications).
  - Commonly missed groups: bryophytes (Pelia sp., mosses), marginal grasses (Agrostis stolonifera), certain algae (Cladophora, Vaucheria).
  - Effect on metrics: QA tended to yield higher MTR scores by about 5.6 points on average (not statistically significant due to variability).
- Implication: Aquatic plant repeatability is challenging; QA data highlight training needs and protocol refinements.

## River Habitat Survey (RHS)
- Re-survey focus: Degree of variation in 500 m RHS data between CS and QA.
- Findings:
  - Bridges/culverts: 70% of sites showed no difference; minor discrepancies at some sites due to slight relocation of the 500 m stretch.
  - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA): Variation observed; QA scores generally lower than main CS scores.
  - Reported HQA results (example differences): many site-specific differences; average bias indicated main survey higher by ~6.9 units (significant with P < 0.001).
  - Causes: Subjective classification of bank-vegetation structure, especially in moorland landscapes; ambiguity in RHS manual.
- Implication: RHS-derived HQA is sensitive to subjective judgments; emphasis on consistent interpretation and precise location is needed.

## Aquatic Macroinvertebrates
- 2007 macroinvertebrate QA results pending at time of report; macroinvertebrate QA analysis to be reported later.

## Hydrochemistry (Streams and Ponds)
- Streams (30/31 sites re-surveyed): On-site pH and conductivity; lab analyses for phosphate, nitrogen, alkalinity.
- Ponds (re-surveyed at 18/31): Similar sampling and on-site measurements.
- Findings:
  - Rank correlations between main and QA values were highly significant for streams: soluble reactive phosphorus (r = 0.89), total oxidised nitrogen (r = 0.79), alkalinity (r = 0.97), pH (r = 0.74), conductivity (r = 0.97). Confidence in field and lab procedures is high.
  - Pond hydrochemistry: Strong correlations for phosphorus, alkalinity, pH, and conductivity; TON correlation weaker (r = 0.47, not statistically significant, with two ponds showing large TON differences likely due to a two-month gap between surveys).
- Implication: Hydrochemical measurements are repeatable and robust; timing between main and QA surveys should be minimized.

## Wetland Plants (Ponds)
- Ponds surveyed: 16 ponds surveyed in both CS and QA.
- Findings:
  - No significant bias in taxa counts (main survey found 0.6 more taxa on average; P > 0.214).
  - Mean taxon agreement: 59%; 100% agreement at five ponds.
  - Discrepancies due to misidentifications, boundary definition of the pond, and seasonal community changes.
  - 36 taxa missed across surveys, with 29 missed on only one occasion; most missed taxa were grasses, sedges, rushes, or submerged aquatics; seven taxa missed at more than one site (notably Juncus effusus and Agrostis stolonifera).
- Implication: Pond plant surveys exhibit moderate agreement; training should emphasize grass-like taxa and boundary definition.

## Discussion
- Uncertainty is inherent in environmental measurements; QA provides baseline variability for detecting change, guiding surveyor training, and refining protocols.
- Sources of error: spatial (location precision, lateral limits), temporal (seasonal changes, disturbance), and inter-surveyor competence (thorough searches, species identifications).
- Temporal considerations: Many QA surveys occurred weeks after main surveys, limiting ability to isolate inter-surveyor error from temporal variation.
- Observations:
  - Stream plant and RHS data showed notable inter-surveyor differences, but some measures (e.g., bridge counts) were more repeatable.
  - Biodiversity measures (taxon richness) are particularly sensitive to search effort and identification skills.
- Recommendations:
  - Improve identification skills for bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grass-like species.
  - Increase awareness of bryophytes, algae, and grass-like taxa during plant surveys.
  - Emphasize returning to the exact survey stretch to minimize spatial errors.
  - Strengthen RHS training focusing on elements prone to subjective judgment and discrepancies.
  - Conduct QA within two weeks of the main survey to better isolate inter-surveyor effects.
- Conclusion: The CS2007 freshwater QA provides a baseline for future QA, identifies protocol vulnerabilities, and informs targeted training to improve data quality and comparability across surveys. The Freshwater Technical Report (late 2009) will include macroinvertebrate QA results.
