# Countryside Survey: Ponds Report from 2007

## Executive summary
- Ponds are abundant in Britain with a total stock around 478,000 (2007), and a high turnover between 1998 and 2007: about 70,600 new ponds created and ~18,000 lost, yielding a net +12.5%.
- Biodiversity value is high: 205 wetland plant species recorded across 259 detailed ponds; mean plant richness per pond was 8.2 species, with new ponds often richer and supporting uncommon species.
- Pond quality is generally degraded in lowland England/Wales: about 80% of ponds fall into Poor or Very Poor categories (PSYM-based), with Scotland showing comparatively higher quality.
- New ponds tend to colonise quickly and can be more diverse than older ponds, especially when located in semi-natural landscapes; however, most new ponds (around 73%) are in landscapes with intensive land use, risking long-term declines.
- Key drivers of poorer pond quality include nutrient enrichment (nitrogen and phosphorus), inflows/outflows from runoff or ditches, and increased tree shade; proximity to other wetlands tends to buffer decline.
- Landscape context matters: semi-natural catchments and connectivity to other waterbodies support higher pond quality and biodiversity.
- Climate change implications: potential shifts to drier summers and wetter winters threaten pond permanence; creation of new ponds can mitigate losses but requires careful siting (buffered from intensive land use) to sustain biodiversity long term.
- Policy relevance: findings inform Biodiversity Action Plan priorities, Habitats Directive links, and Water Framework Directive considerations; emphasise catchment-scale management and freshwater network restoration.

## Stock, turnover, and pond characteristics
- Stock: 478,000 ponds in Britain (2007); mean density about 2.1 ponds per km2.
- Turnover (1998–2007): Lost ~18,000 ponds; Created ~70,600 ponds; net increase ~1.4% per year.
- Size class (2007): ~70% of ponds 25 m2 to 400 m2; few ponds 1–2 ha.
- New vs older ponds:
  - 16 identified new ponds since 1998; typically near streams, with sand/gravel bases, less shade, and often in landscapes less semi-natural.
  - New ponds generally similar in major physico-chemical attributes to older ponds but with some higher phosphorus enrichment observed in a subset.
  - New ponds can reach high PSYM categories but long-term quality depends on surrounding land use; many new ponds located in intensive landscapes risk later decline.

## Biodiversity and plant richness
- 205 plant species across 259 ponds; about half of Britain’s wetland flora.
- Mean pond plant richness: 8.2 species per pond; lower in England compared with Scotland/Wales.
- Lowland trend (1996–2007): plant richness declined from 10.2 to 8.2 species per pond; declines especially in submerged/emergent groups; floating-leaved plants stable.
- Uncommon and threatened species: 5 nationally uncommon/threatened species recorded; numerous locally uncommon species.
- Invasives: about 10% of ponds had at least one invasive species, with New Zealand Pigmyweed among the common invaders; no clear national increase since 1996.
- PSYM and ecological quality (England/Wales; PSYM section):
  - NSEP (submerged/emergent richness) and NUS (uncommon species) notably below pristine expectations; TRS (nutrient enrichment) slightly elevated.
  - Approximately 75%+ similarity to pristine state is observed as a benchmark, but most England/Wales ponds fall below, with around 80% categorized as Poor or Very Poor; ~8% Good.
- Scotland (PSYM not developed): pond quality comparatively higher when assessed against pristine Scottish references.

## New ponds versus lost ponds: community and quality
- Replacements not directly substituting lost communities:
  - Lost ponds and new ponds both exhibit above-average species richness and uncommon species, but there is little overlap in more uncommon species between lost and new ponds.
  - New ponds tend to host early colonisers, while some lost ponds supported species associated with more mature sites (e.g., Fat Duckweed, Great Yellow-cress).
- Overall implication: biodiversity gains and losses are broadly similar in numbers and overall quality, but the specific community types lost are not fully replaced by new ponds. Caution due to small sample sizes.

## Drivers, landscape context, and habitat quality
- Key degradation drivers: high nutrients (SRP and TON), inflows, road runoff, and increasing tree shade.
- Landscape context: ponds in semi-natural catchments and near other wetlands tend to maintain higher plant richness and PSYM scores.
- New ponds: quality and biodiversity benefits are higher where new ponds are surrounded by semi-natural land use; most 0–9 year ponds in 2007 were surrounded by intensive land use, suggesting limited long-term biodiversity potential unless land use around them improves.

## Climate change and future considerations
- Climate change projections indicate warmer, drier summers and wetter winters, potentially reducing water availability and increasing extremes.
- Ponds’ hydroperiod (permanence vs semi-permanence) influences community composition; many lowland ponds are shallow and seasonally variable, implying vulnerability to climate shifts.
- Creation of new ponds offers a mitigation pathway by increasing habitat area and connectivity, especially if sited to avoid intensive land use and support long-term high quality.

## Policy relevance and biodiversity value
- Priority Pond criteria under UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) to be recognised for protection and policy emphasis.
- Ponds are linked to Habitats Directive Annex habitats and species; WFD monitoring is relevant for standing waters, though most ponds fall outside 50 ha thresholds.
- Ecosystem services include flood attenuation, water storage, and potential carbon sequestration; improving pond networks supports catchment-scale hydrology and biodiversity resilience.

## Data quality, limitations, and notes
- Methodological changes over time (e.g., inclusion of ponds in woodlands/golf courses in 2007) affect absolute counts; some recalibration occurred to aid comparability.
- Lost ponds: limited field data on the quality of lost ponds; new vs lost pond comparisons rely on small samples.
- PSYM applicability: robust for England/Wales (plants-based PSYM); Scotland lacks PSYM-based comparisons.
- Weather effects: drought years and wet years influence detectability of plant communities and measurement of drawdown; climate-related shifts could alter interpretability.

## Practical data use and end-user insights
- Key data points for dashboards:
  - Stock and turnover trends (1998–2007) by region and size class.
  - Biodiversity metrics: total plant species per pond, mean richness by region, presence of uncommon/nationally important species.
  - PSYM-based quality category distribution (England/Wales) with caveats for Scotland.
  - Landscape context indicators: surrounding land use (0–5 m and 0–100 m), proximity to other waterbodies, and presence of semi-natural surrounds.
  - Nutrient and pollution indicators: SRP and TON levels, evidence of road runoff, inflows/outflows, and shade.
  - New pond characteristics: age, proximity to streams, substrate, shade, land-use surrounds, and nutrient status.
