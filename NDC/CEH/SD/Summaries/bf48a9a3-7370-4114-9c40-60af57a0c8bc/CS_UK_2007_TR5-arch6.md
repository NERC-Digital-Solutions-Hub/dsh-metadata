HEADWATERS

- Overview and purpose
  - Countryside Survey 2007 field methods for headwaters and pond condition, integrating freshwater macroinvertebrate, hydromorphological (River Habitat Survey, RHS), aquatic plant (macrophyte) surveys, and water chemistry.
  - Headwater component: re-survey of all 425 CS2000 squares for macroinvertebrates (RIVPACS), RHS hydromorphology, aquatic plant community (MTR), physical characteristics, and a headwater water chemistry subset (SRP, TON, alkalinity) for 25 of the 425 squares.
  - Pond component: survey of randomly selected ponds within CS2007 squares containing ponds (about 629 squares); per square, one pond is surveyed for macrophytes, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Aims to produce standardized, shareable data enabling cross-site comparisons and long-term trend assessment.

- Study design and data scope
  - Headwaters: 425 squares with 500 m headwater sampling stretches; macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS), RHS habitat survey, aquatic plant survey (MTR) and up to 50 m plant coverage data; water chemistry sampling at 25 sites.
  - Ponds: 629 squares with a random pond in each to survey macrophyte community, physical characteristics, and water chemistry; mapping and boundary delineation required.
  - Data capture systems used in-field: RAPID (RHS data entry), IRIS (aquatic plant data entry), and standard paper forms for some components.

- Data collection, formats, and workflow
  - RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling
    - Field method: 3-minute kick-net active sampling plus a mandatory 1-minute manual search, across a single continuous sampling area (5–15 m typical).
    - Sample handling: net washing, fixation with 40% formalin to approx. 4% final concentration, laboratory identification, and specimen retention guidance.
    - Data capture: RIVPACS Sample Area Form capturing square, river, site, date, NGR, sample method, sample time, proportionality, width/depth/velocity categories, substrate, other habitats, and photographic records.
  - Hydromorphological data (RHS)
    - 500 m RHS reach centered on macroinvertebrate sampling point; 10 spot-checks with a River Habitat Survey (RHS) protocol.
    - Data entry via RAPID on a Tablet PC; validation checks ensure completeness before submission.
    - On-site photography and map-based relocation features; on-site data validation to ensure data integrity.
  - Aquatic plant data (MTR/macrophyte survey)
    - 100 m reach centered on macroinvertebrate site; walk and record presence/cover of macrophyte and bryophyte species on a 9-point cover scale.
    - Plant identification targets to species where possible; collection of voucher specimens when needed; rare species are flagged for expert confirmation.
    - In-field data entry via IRIS (two-page form with species lists and cover data; physical site attributes on a second page); on-site validation prior to leaving the site.
  - Water chemistry and field measurements
    - Headwaters: indicative water chemistry sample collected downstream of macroinvertebrate area; field measurements include conductivity and pH using a Hanna Combi meter; SRP, TON, and alkalinity measured from filtered 50 ml samples.
    - On-site sample handling: double rinsing, on-site filtration with disposable syringe filters, labeling standards, and secure packaging for laboratory analysis at CEH Lancaster.
  - Data validation and quality control
    - On-site validation using RAPID and IRIS; prompts for missing data or inconsistencies; mandatory confirmation that data are complete before leaving the site.
    - Field survey checklists completed jointly by both surveyors; periodic audits by CEH staff to maintain consistency and quality.
  - Transport and sample management
    - Macroinvertebrate samples shipped in labeled pots within transport boxes (6–8 pots per box); use of Transport Emergency Card (TREM) for fixative hazards; CEH Dorset processing facility for onward analysis.
    - Plant specimens for ID confirmation posted or couriered to CEH Dorset; preserve with appropriate methods (pressed or pickled) and label specimens with CS square/pond identifiers.
  - Data delivery and reporting
    - Paper field sheets and sample materials organized for monthly courier to CEH Dorset or Pond Conservation; data exports and sharing with the project team as part of the CS2007 program.

- Methods and procedures (highlights)
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling specifics
    - Use of a standard 25 cm2 pond-net with 900 μm mesh; collect across habitat types in proportion to cover; avoid sampling across deeply variable or unsafe sections; minimize disturbance and maintain sample dampness.
    - Manual searching components target surface-dwelling and attached organisms; total sampling time strictly controlled (3 minutes for main sample, 1 minute for manual search).
  - Sample fixing and labeling
    - Final sample preserved in 40% formalin to approximately 4% formaldehyde; detailed labeling inside each sample bag and outer container with square, pond, date, and sample type.
  - RHS field data collection
    - 500 m study reach with spot-checks; use of RAPID to capture data with validation step-by-step; relocation features and photographs to assist future re-surveys.
  - Macrophyte (MTR) survey technique
    - 100 m surveyed length; record presence/cover for all macrophyte species; use systematic cover estimation scales and reference guides for metric consistency; use grapnels to sample submerged plants where wading is not possible.
  - Plant identification and specimen handling
    - Species to be identified to the closest reliable taxonomic level; routine sampling of certain taxa (e.g., Ranunculus, Callitriche, Potamogeton) for lab confirmation when necessary; guidance for rare or fragile species to minimize impact.
  - Pond condition survey
    - Definitions and mapping of pond boundaries (outer winter water level); measurement of pond area, drawdown, sediment and pond base composition; turbidity estimation; water chemistry and pollution indicators; recording of inflows/outflows and pond management and surrounding land use.

- Data products and governance
  - Standardized data capture enables cross-square comparisons and integration with historic CS2000 data.
  - Outputs feed into national freshwater surveys and conservation programs via Pond Conservation and CEH Dorset analyses, with explicit transport, storage, and submission procedures to maintain sample integrity.

- Practical considerations and safety
  - Health and safety: many headwater sites are pre-sampled; risk assessment emphasized; sampling may be halted if site conditions are deemed unsafe.
  - Collaboration and quality assurance: regular team rotations and audits; trained in RHS, RIVPACS macroinvertebrate methods, and MTR plant surveys; on-site validation to minimize data errors.

- Pond mapping and condition assessment workflow
  - Mappers identify ponds in each square; survey pond chosen per square; boundary delineation, boundary condition notes, and boundary sketching required.
  - Visual and transect-based measurements of sediment and pond base, drawdown height, water depth at multiple transects, and substrate composition recorded for pond condition scoring.
  - Documentation includes photographs, site maps, and consistent labeling to link to macroinvertebrate, RHS, and plant data.

- Supplementary notes and references
  - Key references for methodology include Environment Agency RHS guidance (2003), Murray-Bligh (1999) macroinvertebrate sampling, Holmes et al. (1999) MTR plant method, and Stewart (2004) macrophyte specimen handling.
  - Documentation and contact details provided for sample submission, specimen confirmation, and program coordination (CEH, Pond Conservation, and project contacts).

- End-to-end data lifecycle (summary)
  - Field collection (macroinvertebrates, RHS hydromorphology, macrophytes, water chemistry) → in-field digital data entry (RAPID, IRIS) with instant validation → sample preservation and labeling → transport to CEH/Pond Conservation for processing → data integration and analysis for CS2007 national report and public data sharing.
