# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Overview
  - The freshwater module of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) aims to provide high-quality information on changes in the physical and biological condition of small streams and ponds across Great Britain, including distribution of components of biological diversity.
  - A robust QA process was instituted to ensure field surveyors are skilled, laboratories meet high standards, and uncertainty in data collection is quantified.
  - The QA report serves as a baseline against which future CS freshwater surveys can be judged and informs improvements to field protocols and training.

- QA approach and standards
  - Field staff: All freshwater surveyors required to have solid aquatic plant taxonomy knowledge and receive detailed CS freshwater training; River Habitat Surveys (RHS) conducted by Environment Agency accredited staff; field biologist visits to ensure adherence to methods.
  - Laboratory analysis: Water chemistry analyzed by an ISO 17025-accredited CEH lab; macroinvertebrate samples processed under strict CEH River Communities Group protocols with taxonomic accreditation.
  - Uncertainty assessment: An experienced CEH freshwater biologist repeated CS freshwater tasks on a random-stratified sub-sample to assess error/variation in data and derived condition measures.
  - Outputs: QA data used to assess repeatability and guide improvements; QA acts as a baseline for future data quality and protocols.

- Field survey methods for QA
  - Sub-sample: 31 random-stratified squares re-surveyed (31 streams; 18 of 31 contained a pond).
  - Re-survey effort: ~8% for streams; ~7% for ponds.
  - Relocation and data capture: Used photographs, grid references, and map annotations to relocate the CS2007 survey stretches; data recorded with IRIS on Tablet PCs (plants) and RAPID on Tablet PCs (RHS).

- Aquatic plants (streams)
  - Re-survey: 30 of 31 streams re-surveyed (one site dry).
  - Findings: Main CS2007 plant survey tended to record fewer taxa than QA (significant bias; main survey had about 1.9 fewer taxa on average).
  - Agreement: Mean % taxon agreement between CS2007 and QA was ~31%; 100% agreement only when only a single species was found in both surveys.
  - Discrepancy causes: misidentifications, incomplete searching, differences in exact 100 m reach location, seasonal differences, vegetation changes between surveys, and lateral boundary definitions.
  - Most missed taxa: bryophytes and algae; many errors involved rare taxa (<1% cover); over half of errors attributed to the main surveyors overlooking taxa.
  - Impact on indices: QA tended to score higher on average by ~5.6 units in MTR scores, though not statistically significant.
  - Implication: Large inter-surveyor and taxonomic variation; still, CS2007 main data can be analyzed without corrections, using QA as a quality baseline and focusing on improvements in field protocols and training.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - Re-survey: 31 streams; relocation of 500 m RHS stretch achieved; data collected using the same photographic/grid methods as CS2000.
  - Findings: 70% of sites showed no difference in counts of bridges or culverts; several sites had ±1 differences.
  - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA): Differences between CS2007 and QA scores; QA generally lower than CS by about 6.9 units on average; upland/moorland vegetation classifications (e.g., Molinia grass and heather) contributed to variability in HQA due to subjective judgments (e.g., classifying bank vegetation as Simple vs. Uniform).
  - Implication: Subjective elements in RHS (vegetation structure) introduce variability; counts of physical features were more consistent; given lack of CS2000 QA data, assume similar bias for CS2000 and CS2007 and proceed with caution.

- Hydrochemistry (streams)
  - Parameters: Phosphate, total oxidised nitrogen (TON), alkalinity, pH, conductivity; field pH and conductivity measured on-site.
  - Findings: Strong rank correlations between main CS2007 and QA for all five parameters (phosphate r=0.89, TON r=0.79, alkalinity r=0.97, pH r=0.74, conductivity r=0.97); indicates good repeatability of field and laboratory procedures for most parameters.

- Wetland plants (ponds)
  - Re-survey: 16 ponds surveyed by both CS2007 and QA.
  - Findings: No significant bias in taxa counts; main survey found ~0.6 more taxa on average (not significant).
  - Agreement: Mean taxon agreement ~59%; 100% agreement at 5 ponds.
  - Discrepancies: 36 taxa missed by either survey (29 missed only once); most missed taxa were grasses, sedges, or rushes and small submerged aquatic plants; seven taxa missed at more than one site (notably soft rush and creeping bent).
  - Implication: Pond plant surveys are challenging; training should emphasize identification and search thoroughness for grass-like and submerged taxa.

- Hydrochemistry (ponds)
  - Rank correlations: Four of five parameters showed significant correlations between QA and main surveys; TON differed (r=0.47, P=0.12) with two ponds showing large TON differences, linked to a two-month gap between visits.
  - Implication: Temporal separation can affect chemical comparisons; overall, field and laboratory procedures are consistently applied and data are reliable, with caution advised for TON when surveys are spread apart.

- Discussion and interpretation
  - There is inherent uncertainty in environmental measurements; QA provides a first indication of variability in freshwater data within CS.
  - The QA results inform: changes over time, training targets, and protocol refinements; they also help identify which components are more prone to misinterpretation or repeatability challenges.
  - Temporal factors: Many QA surveys occurred weeks after the main surveys, complicating attribution of differences to inter-surveyor competence versus natural/anthropogenic temporal changes.
  - Subjectivity: RHS vegetation classifications contribute to variability; more objective guidance and training are needed in these areas.
  - Conclusions for data use: The CS2007 freshwater QA data establish baseline variability and do not necessitate corrections to the main CS2007 data at this time; however, they guide improvement priorities for next surveys.

- Implications for future surveys and recommendations
  - Training focus: Improve identification skills for bryophytes and algae, increase awareness of inconspicuous grass-like species, and emphasize precise return to the exact previous survey stretch.
  - Protocol improvements: Strengthen RHS vegetation classification guidance to reduce subjectivity; implement measures to ensure QA work occurs within two weeks of the main survey at the same site.
  - Data integration and accessibility: QA datasets provide a transparent basis for combining CS data with other environmental datasets and for enabling access to underlying data used to create final outputs.
  - Next steps: Macroinvertebrate QA results were to be reported in the Freshwaters Report (late 2009); CS freshwater QA overall serves as a baseline to improve field protocols and training for subsequent CS surveys.

- Conclusion
  - The CS2007 freshwater QA exercise quantified repeatability and bias across aquatic plant surveys, RHS, hydrochemistry, and pond plant surveys, revealing significant inter-surveyor and temporal variability in some components.
  - The QA findings guide targeted training and protocol refinements, establish a baseline for future CS surveys, and support the ongoing use of standardized methods to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
