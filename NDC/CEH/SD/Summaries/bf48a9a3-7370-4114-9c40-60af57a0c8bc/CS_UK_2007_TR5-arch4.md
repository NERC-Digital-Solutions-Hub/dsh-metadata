# Headwaters

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007); re-survey of headwater streams across GB.
  - Headwater survey features include macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS bioassessment), hydromorphological data (River Habitat Survey, RHS), physical characteristics, aquatic plant community (MTR), and water chemistry.
  - CS2000 headwaters will be re-surveyed in CS2007 across 425 squares; RHS and macroinvertebrate sampling span 500 m reaches; aquatic plant and water chemistry surveyed within a 100 m reach around the macroinvertebrate site.
  - Pond components: integrated pond mapping and condition assessment across squares with ponds; includes macrophyte survey, water chemistry, environmental data, and pond management/land-use information.

- Data systems and digital workflow
  - Field data capture via specialized digital systems:
    - RHS: RAPID (field data entry on Tablet PC) to record hydromorphology and environmental data; built-in data validation.
    - Macroinvertebrates: RIVPACS Sample Area Form for sampling area, environmental data, and sample labeling; fixative handling and transport instructions.
    - Aquatic plants: IRIS for aquatic macrophyte data entry (species, cover, and site data) with on-site validation.
  - Standardized forms and procedures across disciplines to ensure consistency and comparability (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR, pond surveys).
  - Data quality assurance: on-site validation, mandatory data checks, staff accreditation, and routine audits (~7% of headwater sites) to ensure method consistency and data integrity.
  - Central processing and dispatch: macroinvertebrate and plant samples stored at CEH, transported initially in labeled containers with transport emergency documentation (TREM card); coordination with CEH Dorset for processing; monthly dispatch cadence.

- Key methodologies and data capture details
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
    - Sample area: single continuous stream reach (5–15 m) with proportional habitat sampling; standard 3-minute pond-net sampling plus 1 minute manual search.
    - Sampling and handling: pond-net with 900 µm mesh; three-minute active sampling; preserve samples in 40% formalin to achieve ~4% formaldehyde; detailed labeling and packaging; multiple bags/pots allowed for large samples.
    - Environmental data: width, depth, velocity, substrate, habitat types, and water chemistry from the sample area; photographs and site boards for relocation.
  - Water chemistry
    - On-site field measurements: conductivity and pH using Hanna Combi meters;SRP, TON, and alkalinity via on-site filtration (0.45 µm filters) and 50 ml bottles; meticulous labeling and sample handling to aid lab analysis.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - Update from 2003 RHS protocol; rapid field data entry via RAPID; 500 m RHS centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site; includes spot-checks, bank and channel morphology, shading, and substrate data.
    - Data validation: on-site “Check Data” function; mandatory validation before leaving the site.
    - Data entry structure: 17 sections across 4 pages; drop-down menus to ensure standardized coding; ability to record any square even if RHS cannot be completed.
  - Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR)
    - 100 m channel length centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling point; wading and grapnel methods to record submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species with abundance categories.
    - Specimen collection and laboratory confirmation for difficult taxa; identification keys and guidance for rare species; specimen submission protocols and label formats.
    - Data capture in IRIS; establishment of 100 m survey length, percentage cover estimates, and systematic techniques to improve accuracy (including tables and conversion guidance for cover estimates across various channel widths).
  - Pond condition survey (CS2007)
    - Mapping and boundary delineation; identification of survey ponds (25 m2 to 2 ha); field steps include turbidity estimation, water chemistry sampling, environmental survey (amenity use), macrophyte survey, and drawdown measurements.
    - Photographs and sketch maps to aid relocation; area estimation via pacing; drawdown height and depth measurements; sediment and pond base composition; pollution and inflows/outflows; surrounding land use and amenity value.
    - Health and safety requirements for pond work; two surveyors coordinating tasks; transport and dispatch of pond plant and macroinvertebrate specimens to Pond Conservation.
    - Ponds on square boundaries: entire pond surveyed if part lies within the square.
  - Data management and outputs
    - Centralized data capture enables cross-method integration (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR, pond data) for coherent national datasets.
    - On-site validation and standardized labeling enable traceability (square number, pond code, date, GPS coordinates, surveyor IDs, etc.).
    - Sample information sheets and field notes accompany lab submissions to ensure accurate linkage to survey data.

- Governance, training and quality assurance
  - Training and accreditation required:
    - Environment Agency RHS certification.
    - RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling and MTR aquatic plant surveying training.
  - Regular team rotation to maintain consistency across surveyors.
  - Quality control audits of headwater sites (approximately 7%).
  - Field survey check-list used to ensure all tasks are completed before leaving the site.
  - Standardized transport and handling procedures (TREM cards, packaging, and dispatch).

- Challenges and considerations for data leaders
  - Managing heterogeneous data types (biological, chemical, physical habitat, and land-use/amenity data) across headwater and pond contexts.
  - Ensuring data discoverability, metadata completeness, and cross-dataset compatibility between RIVPACS, RHS, MTR, IRIS, and pond datasets.
  - Navigating safety, accessibility, and variable field conditions (e.g., spates, turbidity) that affect data collection and comparability.
  - Coordinating data flows from field collection to CEH processing and back into centralized archives for policy-relevant outputs.
