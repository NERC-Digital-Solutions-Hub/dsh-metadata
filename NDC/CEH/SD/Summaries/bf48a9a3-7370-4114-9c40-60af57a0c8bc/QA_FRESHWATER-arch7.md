# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Purpose and scope
  - Establish high-quality baselines for CS freshwater data (streams and ponds) across Great Britain.
  - Assess uncertainty and inter-surveyor variability in field and laboratory procedures to support confident change detection and data use in GIS products.

- QA framework and components
  - Field and laboratory QA across aquatic plants, River Habitat Survey (RHS), aquatic macroinvertebrates, hydrochemistry, and ponds.
  - Random-stratified sub-sample: 31 squares for streams (8% re-survey) and 18 ponds (7% re-survey for pond tasks); 30 of 31 streams re-surveyed for aquatic plants; on-site relocation and digital data capture via tablet systems (IRIS, RAPID).

- Data collection and re-survey methods
  - Aquatic Plants (streams)
    - Re-located 100 m survey reach; data captured with IRIS on Tablet PC.
    - Validation included taxonomic standardisation and removal of terrestrial taxa.
  - RHS (streams)
    - Re-survey of 500 m reach using identical relocation materials (photos, grid refs, maps); data captured with RAPID on Tablet PC.
  - Aquatic Macroinvertebrates
    - Re-survey site and standard sampling protocols; processing by CEH River Communities Group; results to be reported with the Freshwaters Report.
  - Hydrochemistry
    - On-site pH and conductivity; lab analysis for phosphate, nitrogen, alkalinity; 30 of 31 sites re-surveyed.
  - Ponds (aquatic plants and hydrochemistry)
    - 18 ponds re-surveyed for plants; 15 of 18 ponds re-sampled for hydrochemistry.

- Key findings by data component
  - Aquatic Plants (streams)
    - Main CS vs QA plant taxa counts: QA tended to find more taxa; main survey found significantly fewer taxa (about 1.9 taxa fewer on average; P < 0.001 bias).
    - Mean species list agreement: 31% across 29 sites; substantial discrepancies due to misidentifications, search differences, exact location, seasonal changes, and boundary definitions.
    - Most missed taxa: bryophytes and certain grasses/rushes; common misses include Pelia sp., Rhynchostegium, Agrostis stolonifera, Cladophora, Vaucheria.
    - Impact on metrics: QA surveys tended to yield higher MTR scores by about 5.6 (not statistically significant) with wide variability.
    - Conclusion: high repeatability challenges for aquatic plant surveys; QA provides a baseline for improving field protocols and training.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - Bridge/culvert counts: 70% identical between CS and QA; remaining discrepancies typically ±1 or ±2 due to small stretch relocation differences.
    - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA): QA scores generally lower than main CS scores by about 6.9 units (significant bias, P < 0.001). Classification differences in bank-face and bank-top vegetation (e.g., moorland vegetation labeled differently) drive disparities, especially in upland/moorland zones.
    - Conclusion: RHS data show variability in subjective components; main RHS dataset can be used with awareness of QA-derived biases; no CS2000 QA data to adjust for potential year-to-year bias.
  - Hydrochemistry (streams and ponds)
    - Ranked parameter correlations (QA vs main) were high for most measures: soluble reactive phosphorus (r = 0.89), alkalinity (r = 0.97), pH (r = 0.74), conductivity (r = 0.97); total oxidised nitrogen varied less (r = 0.79 overall, but two ponds with a two-month gap reduced reliability for TON).
    - Recommendation: minimize temporal gaps between main and QA sampling; treat TON results with caution when timing differs.
  - Wetland Plants (ponds)
    - 16 ponds compared; no significant bias overall (main slightly higher taxa count by ~0.6); mean agreement 59%, with 100% agreement on five ponds.
    - Common misses involve grasses and rushes; boundary definition and seasonal changes contribute to differences.
    - TON correlations weaker between QA and main than other parameters but still show strong overall consistency for most measures.
  - Ponds (plants) and broader QA implications
    - First CS freshwater plant data collection for British ponds; QA provides baseline to inform future pond surveys and training needs.

- Uncertainty, sources of error, and timing
  - Primary sources of variability: spatial (location of survey reach), temporal (seasonal changes, disturbance events), and inter-surveyor competence (identification, thoroughness).
  - Difficulty in precisely repeating plant surveys: combining these factors makes isolating a single error source challenging.
  - Temporal gap between main and QA surveys reduces the ability to draw firm conclusions for plant data; best practice is to conduct QA within two weeks of the main survey.

- Implications for GIS data products and data use
  - QA establishes a baseline for data quality across freshwater components, informing data provenance, uncertainty, and confidence in map-based analyses.
  - Results guide improvements in field protocols, surveyor training, and data standards, particularly for:
    - Aquatic bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grass-like taxa.
    - Exact relocation of survey reaches and consistent boundary definitions.
    - Timeliness of QA relative to main surveys (prefer within two weeks).
  - Interpretations of change over time should account for documented biases and variability (e.g., higher RHS HQA by main survey in subjective classifications; plant taxon richness variability).
  - Data fusion and comparative analyses (CS2000 vs CS2007) should treat potential year-specific biases cautiously due to lack of QA data for CS2000.
  - Future data products should incorporate QA-derived metadata, including survey timing, reach relocation details, taxa detection probabilities, and observer notes to support spatial analyses and uncertainty modeling.

- Conclusions and next steps
  - The CS2007 freshwater QA survey provides essential baseline insight into measurement uncertainty and inter-surveyor variation, guiding targeted training and protocol refinements for improved GIS-ready data.
  - Emphasis on improving aquatic plant identification, bryophyte and algae recognition, precise relocation, and reducing temporal gaps between main and QA surveys.
  - Macroinvertebrate QA results are forthcoming (Freshwater Technical Report due late 2009) to complete the QA baseline across freshwater components.
