# Countryside Survey: Ponds Report from 2007

## Overview
- First GB-wide assessment of pond quality and extent; total ponds ~478,000 (2007) with mean density ~2.1 per km2.
- Substantial turnover 1998–2007: ~70,600 new ponds created, ~18,000 lost; net increase ~12.5% (about 1.4% per year).
- New ponds generally found to be richer in biodiversity and of higher initial quality than older ponds; long-term value depends on surrounding land use and pollutant inputs.

## Net changes in pond stock
- England: new ponds ~+48,300; losses ~14,900 (significant net increase).
- Scotland: new ponds ~+11,000; losses ~0.8 (not significant).
- Wales: new ponds ~+11,3k; losses ~2.2k.
- Size distribution (2007): 69% of ponds are 0.0025–0.04 ha; 24% 0.04–0.2 ha; 6% 0.2–1 ha; 1% 1–2 ha.

## Biodiversity and plant richness
- 269 ponds surveyed in detail yielded 205 wetland plant species (about half of GB’s wetland flora).
- Mean pond plant richness: 8.2 species per pond; England/Wales ponds typically lower in richness than Scotland/Wales.
- 1996–2007: lowland plant richness declined ~20% (10.2 to 8.2 per pond); declines in emergent/submerged groups; floating-leaved plants stable.
- PSYM-based assessments (England/Wales): about 80% of ponds in Poor/Very Poor condition; ~8% Good.
- Good-quality ponds tended to have lower nutrient inputs, less shading, more connectivity to other waterbodies, and less intensive land-use around them.

## New vs. lost ponds
- New ponds (0–9 years old) in 2007 often higher in species richness and quality than older ponds; some new English ponds had Good PSYM (about 24%).
- Lost ponds: limited data; some lost ponds supported locally uncommon or mature-pond species (e.g., Fat Duckweed, Great Yellow-cress), suggesting losses included higher-value communities.
- Overall, biodiversity gains from new ponds and biodiversity losses from pond losses were broadly similar in number and quality, but lost communities were not fully replaced by new pond assemblages.
- Caution: very small sample size for lost ponds; results not widely generalizable.

## Drivers of pond quality and degradation
- High nutrients (N and P), road runoff, inflows, and increasing tree shade linked to lower PSYM scores and degraded quality.
- Proximity to other wetlands and networked freshwater features around ponds associated with higher PSYM scores—buffering effect.
- Climate variability affected pond hydroperiods: 1996 drought dried many ponds; 2007 wetter year reduced drying, with potential temporary mitigation of losses.

## New ponds: potential and limitations
- Creation increased pond habitat area and landscape connectivity, potentially supporting recolonisation and biodiversity gains.
- Long-term biodiversity in new ponds depends on surrounding land use; many new ponds (around 73%) surrounded by substantial intensive land use; roughly half fed by streams or ditches.
- Very few new ponds had semi-natural surrounds (only 6% across studied new ponds; all in Scotland).

## Lost ponds and climate context
- Lost ponds represent a potential loss of biodiversity capacity, but data are insufficient to quantify broader patterns.
- Climate change implications: ponds face risks from altered hydrology and more extreme weather; new ponds can mitigate some losses if placed in suitable landscapes and protected from pollutant inputs.
- Semi-natural catchments and networked wetlands are important for resilience against climate-related perturbations.

## Policy relevance
- Ponds contribute to Habitats Directive Annex 1 habitats; many have implications for protected species and habitats.
- Water Framework Directive monitoring aligns with pond-scale assessments; Priority Habitats include ponds with high ecological quality or exceptional biotic assemblages.
- Recommendations emphasize reducing agricultural pollutants, increasing pond connectivity, and maintaining semi-natural landscapes around ponds to sustain biodiversity.

## Conclusions and implications for monitoring
- Countryside Survey 2007 shows widespread degradation of countryside ponds in England and Wales, with plant richness declining in lowland areas.
- Pond creation has increased overall numbers and connectivity, but long-term biodiversity benefits require high-quality surrounds and reduced nutrient inputs.
- Monitoring should prioritize: nutrient runoff, watershed connectivity, shading, and land-use around ponds; expand data collection in Scotland and on lost ponds; include macroinvertebrate and amphibian responses where possible.
- Key management levers include protecting ponds from agricultural pollutants, locating new ponds in semi-natural landscapes, and reducing shading in over-shaded agricultural landscapes to sustain diverse pond communities.
