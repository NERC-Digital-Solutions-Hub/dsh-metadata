# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Objective and scope
  - Assess QA processes for CS2007 freshwater module to ensure high-quality data on condition of headwater streams and ponds across Great Britain.
  - Establish reproducibility, accuracy, and uncertainty of field and laboratory procedures; baseline for future surveys; inform training and protocol improvements.

- Personnel, training, and accreditation
  - Surveyors: required solid aquatic plant taxonomy knowledge; RHS surveyors Environment Agency accredited; field biologist-supported field adherence checks.
  - Laboratories: CEH water chemistry analyses ISO 17025 accredited; macroinvertebrate processing by CEH River Communities Group with NHM taxonomic accreditation.
  - Emphasis on traceability and standards to support defensible data for governance and sharing.

- QA sampling design and field procedures
  - 31 squares selected via random-stratified sampling to cover environmental zones; re-sampled by experienced CEH biologist.
  - Sampling effort: streams re-surveyed in all 31 squares (8% re-survey rate); ponds re-surveyed in 18 of 31 squares (7%).
  - Location and data capture: relocation aided by photographs, grid references, map annotations; data recorded with IRIS on Tablet PC (plants) and RAPID on Tablet PC (RHS).
  - Measured domains: aquatic plants (streams and ponds), River Habitat Survey (RHS), aquatic macroinvertebrates, hydrochemistry.

- Key findings by domain

  - Aquatic plants (streams)
    - Re-survey at 30 of 31 sites; two surveys attempted at same locations.
    - Significant bias: main CS2007 survey tended to record 1.9 fewer taxa than QA; mean agreement across 29 sites only 31%.
    - Most errors involve rare taxa (<1% cover); misidentifications and boundary/temporal differences contribute.
    - Derived MTR scores tended to be higher in QA by ~5.6 (not statistically significant) with wide variation.
    - Difficulty in repeating aquatic plant surveys highlighted; largest discrepancies even on same day with site meeting.
    - Implication: use QA results as baseline; proceed with main CS2007 data while informing training and protocols for future surveys.

  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - 70% of sites showed no difference in counts of bridges/culverts; remainder had ±1 differences due to slight relocation differences.
    - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) values showed substantial variation; QA generally lower than main CS surveys (bias ~6.9 units).
    - Variation largely attributed to subjective judgments on bank-face and bank-top vegetation, especially in upland moorland contexts.
    - No QA data for CS2000; therefore analyses proceed with cautious interpretation, assuming similar bias in CS2000 and CS2007.

  - Hydrochemistry
    - Rank correlations between main and QA values strong for most parameters (e.g., alkalinity r=0.97; conductivity r=0.97; pH r=0.74; SRP r=0.89).
    - TON correlation weaker (r=0.47; P=0.12) with notable mismatches in two ponds due to a two-month gap between visits.
    - Overall conclusion: field and lab procedures are consistently applied; time gaps can affect specific analyte comparisons; keep QA vs main surveys temporally close.

  - Wetland plants (ponds)
    - 16 ponds surveyed in both main and QA; no significant overall bias; main survey slightly more taxa on average (0.6) but not significant.
    - Mean taxa agreement 59%; 100% agreement at five ponds.
    - Discrepancies across taxa due to misidentifications, boundary definitions (winter water level), and seasonal shifts.
    - Common missed taxa included grasses and rushes; training implications for bryophytes/algae and conspicuous grass-like species.

- Uncertainty, limitations, and sources of variation
  - Uncertainty arises from spatial (survey reach location, lateral boundaries), temporal (seasonal/system disturbance), and inter-surveyor competence (search thoroughness, identification accuracy).
  - Temporal mismatch (surveys not performed within two weeks) increases difficulty in distinguishing inter-surveyor effects from natural change.
  - Some data (e.g., CS2000) lacked QA data; results rely on cautious interpretation and baseline context.

- Implications for data quality management and governance
  - QA provides a baseline to quantify repeatability and uncertainty, guiding data stewardship decisions.
  - Highlights which elements are most vulnerable to misinterpretation or repeatability issues (e.g., bryophytes, algae, subtle vegetation classifications, precise survey stretch relocation).
  - Underlines the need for clear metadata: exact survey stretches, boundaries, time between surveys, relocation methods, and data entry systems.
  - Supports defensible data sharing by documenting error sources and the need for careful interpretation in change detection analyses.

- Recommendations and next steps for data stewardship and practice
  - Training and protocols
    - Improve identification skills for aquatic bryophytes and algae; increase awareness of inconspicuous grass-like taxa.
    - Emphasize precise return to previous survey stretches; reduce spatial and boundary errors.
    - Strengthen RHS training to reduce subjective classification differences, especially in moorland contexts.
  - Survey timing and coordination
    - Ensure QA surveys occur within two weeks of the main survey to minimize temporal confounding.
  - Data collection and metadata
    - Maintain rigorous documentation of relocation methods, exact coordinates, and survey geometry (100m plant stretches; 500m RHS reach).
    - Record time stamps and any environmental changes between surveys.
  - Data quality and use
    - Use QA findings to interpret change detection cautiously; recognize potential biases in taxa richness estimates.
    - Treat CS2007 QA as a baseline to improve field protocols and to target areas for training in future surveys.
  - Reporting and knowledge transfer
    - Data products should include QA-derived uncertainty and bias notes; CS Freshwater Technical Report (late 2009) to contain macroinvertebrate QA results and further methodology.

- Overall conclusion
  - The CS2007 freshwater QA exercise provides essential insight into variability and uncertainty in field and lab data, highlights key sources of error (notably plant taxon detection and subjective RHS judgments), and offers concrete, actionable guidance to improve data quality, training, and protocols for future Countryside Survey efforts.
