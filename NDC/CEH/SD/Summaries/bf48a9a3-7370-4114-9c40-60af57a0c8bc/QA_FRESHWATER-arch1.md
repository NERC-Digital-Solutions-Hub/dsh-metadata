# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Purpose: Assess the uncertainty and repeatability of CS2007 freshwater data to support change detection, training, and protocol refinement.
- Scope: QA follow-up on field data collected for streams, ponds, aquatic plants, River Habitat Survey (RHS), macroinvertebrates (process later), and hydrochemistry; baseline for future surveys.

## Methods and sampling design

- Random-stratified sub-sample: 31 squares re-surveyed; 18 contained a pond.
- Re-survey tasks:
  - Streams: 100 m aquatic plant stretch, RHS 500 m reach, macroinvertebrate sampling, hydrochemistry.
  - Ponds: aquatic plant surveys and hydrochemistry.
- Procedures:
  - Re-locating survey locations using photographs, grid refs, maps; data recorded via IRIS on Tablet PC (plants) and RAPID (RHS).
  - Laboratory analysis: CEH ISO 17025 accredited; macroinvertebrates processed by CEH River Communities Group (taxonomic accreditation).
- Timing: Attempts to keep QA and main surveys close in time; many QA surveys occurred weeks after main surveys.

## Aquatic plants (streams)

- Re-survey results: 30 of 31 streams re-surveyed; 1 stream dry.
- Key findings:
  - Main CS2007 often found fewer taxa than QA surveys (bias: main survey under-counting taxa).
  - Mean agreement between main and QA taxa lists: 31%; 100% agreement only where a single taxon present in both surveys.
  - Common discrepancies: misidentifications, location differences, seasonal changes, vegetation management, and defining survey boundaries.
  - Most missed taxa were rare (<1% cover); >60% of errors due to taxa overlooked by main surveyors; 15% due to misidentification.
  - Impact on metrics: QA surveys tended to yield higher MTR scores (average +5.6), though not statistically significant; substantial variability exists between surveys.
- Implications:
  - Repeating aquatic plant surveys is challenging; results inform training priorities (bryophytes, algae, grass-like species) and the importance of returning to the exact survey stretch.
  - No CS2000 QA data; CS2007 data treated as baseline with mindful interpretation of biases.

## River Habitat Survey (RHS)

- 31 streams analyzed; 70% showed no difference in counts of bridges/culverts.
- Variations: several sites showed ±1 differences; most discrepancies explained by slight locational differences in the 500 m reach.
- Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA):
  - QA generally lowers HQA scores vs. main CS (average difference ~6.9 units; significant bias P<0.001).
  - Discrepancies largely due to subjective classification of bank-face and bank-top vegetation; upland moorland contexts showed greatest disparity (e.g., interpreting Molinia grass/heather as simple vs uniform).
- Implications:
  - RHS data are partly affected by subjective judgments; rely on main results with awareness of potential bias.
  - Two-week window between main and QA surveys is desirable to minimize temporal effects.

## Hydrochemistry

- Parameters: soluble reactive phosphorus, total oxidised nitrogen, alkalinity, pH, conductivity; plus on-site pH/conductivity.
- Findings:
  - Strong rank correlations between QA and main surveys for streams:
    - SRP r=0.89; TON r=0.79; alkalinity r=0.97; pH r=0.74; conductivity r=0.97 (all P<0.01 or P<0.001).
  - TON differences observed in two ponds with a two-month gap between visits; those gaps can affect results.
- Implications:
  - Overall field and laboratory procedures for hydrochemistry are consistently applied; rankings robust to minor timing differences.

## Wetland plants (ponds)

- 16 ponds surveyed in both main and QA.
- Findings:
  - No significant bias in taxa detection (main found about 0.6 more taxa on average; P>0.214).
  - Mean taxon agreement across ponds: 59%; 100% agreement at five ponds.
  - Taxa missed by either survey (36 total), largely grass/sedge/rushes and submerged aquatics; seven taxa missed at more than one site (notably Juncus effusus and Agrostis stolonifera).
- Implications:
  - Pond plant surveys pose similar repeatability challenges as streams; results provide baseline for future pond surveys and training focus on grass-like taxa.

## Discussion: uncertainty, interpretation, and recommendations

- Acknowledges inherent environmental measurement uncertainty; QA provides baseline for change detection, surveyor training, and protocol refinement.
- Sources of variation:
  - Spatial (survey stretch location and margins), temporal (seasonal changes, disturbance), and inter-surveyor competence (identification and searching thoroughness).
  - Temporal gaps between main and QA surveys limit attribution of error to inter-surveyor differences.
- For streams vs. ponds:
  - Streams: appreciable inter-surveyor variability in plant data and RHS scoring driven by subjective classifications; can partly be mitigated with targeted training and strict location reuse.
  - Ponds: stronger consistency in hydrochemistry rankings; plant surveys more challenging due to identifying minor taxa.
- Practical outcomes:
  - Keep QA and main surveys as close in time as possible (ideally within two weeks).
  - Focus training on bryophytes, algae, inconspicuous grass-like species; emphasize precise relocation to the same survey stretch.
  - Use QA findings to refine field protocols and identify taxonomic groups requiring greater expertise.
- Future work:
  - Freshwater QA macroinvertebrate analysis to be reported later (CS Freshwater Technical Report due late 2009).
  - Overall QA framework to guide improvements in data quality and interpretation for CS2009 and beyond.
