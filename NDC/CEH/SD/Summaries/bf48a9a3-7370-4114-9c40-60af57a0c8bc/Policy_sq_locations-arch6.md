# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: Maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Why locations are confidential:
  - To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- Release and precision when location data may be shared:
  - Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence to allow predetermined-area use.
  - Six-digit (precise) grid references: only released if pre-processing analysis cannot be done by CEH; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, may be provided under licence if the requester demonstrates equal or higher confidentiality protection for their own IP.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- Specific conditions of release:
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals for the defined purpose.
  - Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities after the licensing period.
  - End of license: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
  - No release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements; a clause prevents attempts to deduce precise square locations from supplied data.

- Responsibilities and processes:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, with terms reflecting policy; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
  - If approval is denied, CEH follows Act and Regulations procedures to support the decision.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - Within reasonable demand, CEH will support internal CS partners with pre-processing analysis; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be through collaboration or payment, negotiated case-by-case.
