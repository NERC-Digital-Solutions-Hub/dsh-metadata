# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Applies to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Current CS partners include CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permission for surveying.
- Public-interest rationale; requests for information handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
  
## Access levels and release principles
- Approximate location access: can identify if squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to indicate general area.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require exceptional justification; CEH may process requests to avoid release; VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases only if IP/data requiring equal/higher confidentiality is demonstrated.
- Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional-release conditions as six-digit references.
  
## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be securely stored, and restricted to named individuals with legitimate need for the approved project.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end of the licensing period.
- Data or derived information must not be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; cannot be used to plan visits or to monitor landowners.
- If required, licensees must demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have licensing terms similar to six-digit releases but with fewer IP-confidentiality requirements; license terms prohibit attempts to identify exact square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; licenses must be signed by an authorized senior official.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide preprocessing support within a reasonable timeframe for internal CS partnership use; other requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH may help define requirements or support appropriate use, with collaboration or payment arranged case-by-case.
