# Countryside Survey 2007 Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey Handbook

- Purpose and scope
  - National freshwater assessment for GB using CS2007 to evaluate headwater streams and ponds.
  - Integrates macroinvertebrate biology (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey, RHS), aquatic plant communities (macrophytes), and water chemistry to inform status and potential management actions.
  - Aims to enable correlations, reporting, and predictions about actions’ likely impacts using topic expertise and data analysis.

- Headwaters survey design (CS2007)
  - Re-survey of all CS2000 headwater squares (425 squares) to collect core data.
  - In each square:
    - Macroinvertebrate community sampling (RIVPACS method) and associated environmental variables.
    - Hydromorphological assessment of the watercourse (RHS 2003 method).
    - Aquatic plant community survey (MTR/macrophyte method) and water chemistry for a subset.
  - Randomly selected ponds within CS2007 squares (629 squares containing ponds) receive a pond-specific set of surveys:
    - Aquatic plant community, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.

- Sampling components and methods
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling
    - Standardized 3-minute kick-net sample with a 25 cm2 pond-net (900 µm mesh), plus a mandatory 1-minute manual search.
    - Proportional sampling of habitat types; include multiple habitats where present.
    - Avoid sampling during/after spates; target broad taxa with minimal disturbance to site.
    - Sample handling: keep material damp, retain specimens for lab identification, exclude fish/large, easily identified taxa; fix with 4% formaldehyde.
    - Data capture: fill RIVPACS Sample Area Form with site, date, GPS, duration, substrate, width, depth, velocity, and environmental data; photograph sampling areas.
  - Water chemistry sampling
    - On-site field measurements: conductivity and pH (using Hanna Combi meter), validated with two-point calibration.
    - On-site filtration for SRP, TON, and alkalinity using 0.45 µm syringe filters; collect in 50 ml bottles; follow strict labeling and handling to prevent contamination.
  - Habitat and environmental data (RIVPACS data)
    - Record full width of sampling area, depth at several points, substrate composition, bed stability, and other habitats (rock, moss, filamentous algae, higher plants).
    - Document photos, hydromorphology, and channel characteristics; include narrative notes as needed.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS) data capture
    - 500 m RHS reach around the macroinvertebrate sampling site; 10 spot-checks plus RHS vegetation and substrate details.
    - Field data entered in RAPID (tablet-based system) with validation checks on completion.
    - On-site data validation required before leaving the site.
  - River Habitat Survey data management (RAPID)
    - 17-section form across 4 pages; drop-down fields to minimize errors.
    - Section-specific checks (e.g., spot-check validation) ensure no missing data per site.
    - If RHS cannot be completed at a square, still record the square and note reasons in survey notes.
  - Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR)
    - 100 m macrophyte survey length centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling point.
    - Record presence and percent cover for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species on a 9-point scale.
    - Use grapnel and/or wading to identify macrophytes; collect vouchers and/or lab-confirm identifications for difficult taxa.
    - Identification to species level where possible; sample specimens for confirmation when needed; pay special attention to Ranunculus and other challenging taxa.
    - Document abundance and overall percent cover for the pond’s macrophyte community; record shade over the pond from overhanging vegetation.
  - Data capture for plants (IRIS)
    - IRIS field data entry system for aquatic plant data; two-page form with on-site validation and plant-specimen management (preserve or press).
    - If no plants are found in the 100 m stretch, still complete physical data on page 2.
  - Specimen management
    - Send plant specimens to Pond Conservation for expert confirmation; maintain proper labeling and packaging.
    - Provide guidelines for collecting and preserving specimens, with recommendations for specific taxa that require confirmation.
  - Field survey checklists and QA
    - Two surveyors collaborate; field checklist ensures all components (RHS, macroinvertebrate, plants, water quality) are completed.
    - Quality control includes certification requirements (Environment Agency RHS/RIVPACS/MTR training), periodic audits, and team rotation to preserve consistency.

- Pond condition survey (CS2007)
  - Ponds mapped and identified by mappers; the survey pond is selected per square.
  - Survey steps
    - Photograph pond with square number; identify outer boundary at maximum winter water level; map and sketch pond outline; estimate pond area.
    - Take turbidity estimate and water chemistry samples if water is sufficiently present; otherwise note constraints.
    - Complete pond environmental survey (including amenity use) and macrophyte survey.
    - Assess inflows/outflows, drawdown height, sediment composition, pollution, and pond management.
    - Record surrounding land use in two distance zones (0-5 m and 0-100 m).
    - Evaluate amenity and public access, and evidence of usage (e.g., waterbirds, fishing, boating).
  - Data capture and transport
    - Use dedicated CS2007 pond condition recording sheets for water quality and pond environmental data, and field notes for macrophytes.
    - Samples transported to CEH Dorset; 6-8 macroinvertebrate pots per box; TREM transport cards used for hazardous materials.
    - Monthly courier shipments to CEH Dorset; plant specimens posted to Pond Conservation as required.

- Macrophyte survey specifics
  - Species list and abundance
    - Comprehensive taxonomic list (including many aquatic taxa) with guidance for identification, specimen submission, and rare species handling.
  - Abundance scales
    - D (Dominant) 91-100%, A (Abundant) 51-90%, F (Frequent) 21-50%, O (Occasional) 6-20%, R (Rare) 0-5%.
  - Data handling
    - Record total submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent cover; record tree overhang.
    - Use standardized nomenclature and authoritative field guides; submit voucher specimens when needed.
  - Special notes
    - Rare species confirmation procedures emphasize minimal disturbance; use photographs when possible for rare species confirmation; obtain expert confirmation for critical taxa.

- Data quality, workflow, and deliverables
  - On-site validation via RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (plant survey) prior to leaving site.
  - Post-survey checks: complete field survey checklist, ensure all forms are stapled and transmitted to the proper bodies (Pond Conservation and CEH).
  - Transport and storage
    - Macroinvertebrate pots stored in CEH base; transport with TREM cards; ship when ready to ensure timely processing.
  - Documentation and references
    - Field manuals and references include Environment Agency RHS manual (2003), Murray-Bligh sampling procedure (1999), and Holmes et al. MTR framework (1999).

- Key outputs and intended use
  - Generate a integrated data framework linking headwater macroinvertebrate communities (RIVPACS) with hydromorphology (RHS), aquatic plant communities (MTR/IRIS), and water chemistry to assess riverine ecosystem status.
  - Create a basis for comparing sites over time and across GB, supporting decisions on conservation and management at policy or operational levels.

- Safety and governance
  - Emphasizes field safety for headwater and pond work; two-person teams; risk assessment for sample collection; use of safety equipment and navigational aids; adherence to health and safety guidelines.

- Contacts and administration
  - Samples and data coordination with CEH Dorset and Pond Conservation; project contacts provided in the field handbooks and TREM documentation.
