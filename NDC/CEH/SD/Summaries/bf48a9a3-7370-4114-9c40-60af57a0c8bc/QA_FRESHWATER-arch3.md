# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Purpose
  - Provide high-quality information on changes in physical and biological condition of small streams and ponds across Great Britain.
  - Establish confidence in CS2007 data by assessing field and laboratory procedures, training adequacy, and uncertainty in data collection.
  - Use QA findings to guide future survey protocols, training, and data handling.

- QA design and scope
  - Random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares re-surveyed by an experienced CEH freshwater biologist to assess repeatability and uncertainty.
  - Re-survey included:
    - Streams: 31 sites (8% re-survey effort)
    - Ponds: 18 sites (7% re-survey effort)
  - Focus areas:
    - Aquatic plants, River Habitat Survey (RHS), aquatic macroinvertebrates, hydrochemistry, and ponds for plant and hydrochemical data.

- Data collection and methods (highlights)
  - Aquatic plants (streams)
    - Re-survey at same 100 m stretch; used IRIS data entry; plant identifications validated post-survey.
    - Major finding: main CS2007 survey tended to record fewer taxa than the QA survey.
    - Agreement: mean 31% taxon agreement between main and QA; 100% agreement only where a single taxon was found in both surveys.
    - Errors largely tied to rare taxa; most missed taxa were grasses/rushes and bryophytes/algae.
    - Implications: plant surveys in streams are highly variable; training should improve bryophyte/algae identification, search thoroughness, and exact stretch relocation.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - Focus on 500 m reach: 70% of sites had no difference in bridges/culverts; some sites showed small discrepancies due to slight relocation differences.
    - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) values: noteworthy variation between CS and QA due to subjective classification of bank-face and bank-top vegetation, especially in moorland contexts.
    - All 31 squares showed some difference in overall HQA, with QA often rating lower than main survey; upland sites showed greatest disparity.
    - Conclusion: RHS is somewhat subjective; 22 of 31 sites matched for bridges/culverts, but overall HQA scores differed due to interpretation.
  - Hydrochemistry
    - 30 of 31 stream sites sampled for nutrients and alkalinity; on-site pH and conductivity measured.
    - Strong rank correlations between main and QA across parameters (e.g., alkalinity r=0.97, phosphorus r=0.89, conductance r=0.97).
    - TON (total oxidised nitrogen) showed less agreement in two ponds with a two-month gap between surveys.
    - Conclusion: field and lab procedures are consistently applied; close timing between QA and main surveys is important for TON.
  - Wetland plants (ponds)
    - 16 ponds with both surveys; no significant bias in taxa recorded (main tended to record 0.6 more taxa on average, not significant).
    - Mean agreement ~59%; five ponds with 100% agreement.
    - Reasons for discrepancies: misidentifications, boundary definition, seasonal changes, and timing differences.
    - Taxa missed most frequently: grasses/sedges/rushes; several small submerged aquatic taxa.
  - Ponds hydrochemistry
    - Significant correlations for four of five parameters (phosphorus, alkalinity, pH, conductivity); TON less consistent due to sample timing differences.
    - Overall, data appear robust but timing between main and QA surveys should be tightened.

- Uncertainty, interpretation, and limitations
  - Inherent uncertainty in environmental measurements; QA provides baseline variability and helps target training and protocol improvements.
  - Main sources of error: spatial (accurate location and boundaries), temporal (seasonal or disturbance-driven changes), and inter-surveyor competence (identification and thoroughness); temporal errors were exacerbated by time gaps between main and QA surveys.
  - Subjectivity in RHS classifications contributed to variability; exact replication of 500 m survey stretches and vegetation interpretations are challenging.
  - No CS2000 QA data, so precautionary assumption: CS2000 and CS2007 have similar bias levels; main RHS data can be analyzed with mindful acknowledgment of quality issues.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy
  - QA findings provide actionable guidance for improving monitoring protocols and training priorities, including:
    - Enhanced training for aquatic bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grass-like species.
    - Increased emphasis on accurately returning to the exact 100 m survey stretch and clearly defining lateral boundaries.
    - Improved RHS training to reduce subjective variation in bank-vegetation classification, particularly in upland/moorland habitats.
  - Data governance and openness considerations
    - QA highlights the importance of data validation, taxonomic standardisation, and clear documentation of survey methods and boundaries to enable reproducibility and auditability.
    - Ensure QA and main survey data are captured in a timely manner to minimize temporal discrepancies.
  - timelines and future work
    - Recommendation to perform QA within two weeks of the main survey location to strengthen comparability.
    - Macroinvertebrate QA results to be reported later (CS Freshwaters Technical Report due late 2009).

- Conclusions
  - The CS2007 freshwater QA provides a baseline estimate of measurement variability and identifies specific areas where monitoring protocols and training can be improved.
  - While some data types (hydrochemistry) show strong repeatability, plant-based and RHS measures exhibit notable inter-surveyor differences, especially for rare taxa and subjective classifications.
  - The QA process informs better design of future surveys, supports improved data quality, and helps tailor governance and data management approaches for environmental health monitoring.
