# Countryside Survey 2007

- Aim of the document
  - Establish environmental health measures to scrutinise policy, evaluate outcomes, and inform future decisions across GB freshwater habitats, with a focus on headwater streams and ponds within a national monitoring framework.

- Who this document targets
  - Authors and coordinators (monitoring framework designers) guiding field survey teams, data collection, data management, and governance for CS2007.

- How the monitoring framework is implemented (high-level approach)
  - Engage stakeholders and learn from prior surveys to identify useful indicators and avoid duplication.
  - Identify and verify data sources; address metadata gaps by contacting data originators; add metadata where needed.
  - Commission new data when gaps exist; set data quality, openness, and data-management standards at source.
  - Ensure data are quality assured, cleaned, transformed, analysed, and clearly presented (reports, charts, dashboards).
  - Disseminate outputs, consult stakeholders, share underlying data appropriately, and implement data governance processes.

- Key components of the CS2007 freshwater monitoring
  - Headwaters (CS2007 Headwater Survey)
    - Coverage: All 425 CS2000 squares re-surveyed; macroinvertebrate community, hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey), water chemistry, and aquatic plant community surveys.
    - Survey design: For headwater streams, a 500 m sampling length is used to define the RHS and macroinvertebrate sampling area; aquatic plant sampling spans a 100 m stretch centered on the macroinvertebrate point.
    - New sampling sites: 25 of the 425 squares will host a new site on smaller watercourses to improve headwater focus.
    - Data collection and forms: Macroinvertebrate sampling, environmental data (width, depth, velocity, substratum, etc.), water chemistry, and plant surveys are recorded using standardized forms (RIVPACS, RHS, IRIS, RAPID).
    - Photography and relocation: Photos of sampling areas and marker boards to aid relocation; RHS and macroinvertebrate sites are geolocated and recorded with detailed sketch maps.
    - Safety and sequencing: Team roles and task sequencing defined; safety considerations for field sampling emphasized (risk assessment and site-specific hazards).

  - Pond Condition Survey (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey)
    - Mapping and boundary: All ponds in a square are mapped and a survey pond is identified for detailed macrophyte survey, environmental characteristics, and water chemistry.
    - Procedures: Steps include photographing the pond, outlining and sketching boundary, estimating area, drawdown height, water/sediment depths, substrate and pond-base composition, pollution assessment, inflows/outflows, and pond management.
    - Macrophyte survey: Survey of macrophyte species within the pond’s outer boundary; biomass is recorded (submerged, floating-leaved, emergent) with careful species identification and rare species considerations; samples sent to experts when needed.
    - Surrounding context and amenity: Recording surrounding land use, amenity value, and public access/use around ponds.
    - Quality control and transport: All samples are labeled and stored for transport to CEH; formaldehyde-based fixatives used for macroinvertebrates; TREM cards accompany transport; monthly dispatch to CEH Dorset.

- Data collection systems and field workflows
  - RIVPACS: Macroinvertebrate sampling protocol with standardized area and time (3-minute kick-net plus 1-minute manual search); detailed sample handling, labeling, fixation, and storage guidelines.
  - RHS (River Habitat Survey): 500 m field reach per site; 10 spot-checks plus channel vegetation and substrate sections; data captured in RAPID on a Tablet PC; on-site validation to ensure data completeness.
  - MTR Macrophyte survey: 100 m reach (50 m upstream and downstream of macroinvertebrate center); recording presence/cover of macrophytes; specimen handling and identification guidance; sampling for specimen confirmation when needed.
  - IRIS: Aquatic plant data entry system for MTR data; two-page data entry with on-site validation; plant list organized by major groups; procedures for handling indeterminate specimens and sampling for laboratory confirmation.
  - RAPID: River Habitat Survey data entry; 4-page interface with drop-down fields; on-site validation and site-square selection; supports photographs and site relocation data.
  - Pond Mapping and Field Sheets: Detailed CS2007 pond fieldsheets for boundary, area, drawdown, turbidity, water chemistry, substrates, pollution, inflows/outflows, pond management, land use, amenity, and macrophyte data; structured to support subsequent submission to Pond Conservation.

- Data governance, quality assurance, and training
  - Ensured through certificates and accreditation (Environment Agency RHS/RIVPACS techniques); regular team rotations to maintain technique consistency; ~7% of headwater sites audited by CEH; on-site data validation to minimize errors; comprehensive field survey checklists to avoid omissions.

- Operational logistics and safety
  - Health and safety emphasized for field work with water; two-person survey teams; risk assessment for each site; safety equipment and procedures outlined for pond and river environments.
  - Transit and storage of samples: macroinvertebrate pots and plant specimens transported in labeled containers with TREM cards; monthly dispatch to CEH Dorset; rapid communication of sample shipments.

- Notes on data interpretation and harmonization
  - RHS uses updated 2003 Environment Agency protocols; data values remain comparable to prior versions.
  - Data capture is designed to enable retrospective relocation, comparison across years, and integration of multiple indicators (biological, physical, chemical) for holistic environmental health assessment.

- Overall aim of CS2007 (recap)
  - To provide a coherent, data-rich framework for monitoring environmental health across GB freshwater habitats, supporting policy scrutiny, impact assessment, and informed decision-making through standardized, high-quality data and accessible outputs.
