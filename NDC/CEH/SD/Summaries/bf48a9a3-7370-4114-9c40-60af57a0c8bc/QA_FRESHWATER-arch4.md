# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

## Aim
- Provide high-quality information on changes in the physical and biological condition of small streams and ponds across Great Britain.
- Quantify uncertainty in field data to establish reliability and baselines for future surveys.
- Baseline for improving field protocols, training, and data handling of freshwater components within Countryside Survey.

## Methods
- QA design: random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares re-surveyed by an experienced CEH freshwater biologist to assess error/variation.
- Components re-surveyed: streams (8% re-survey) and ponds (7% re-survey).
- Data collection systems: aquatic plants and RHS re-located with photographs, grid refs, and map annotations; data recorded with IRIS (streams) and RAPID (RHS) on Tablet PCs.
- Salient activities:
  - Aquatic plants: re-survey at 100 m stretches; taxonomic validation and differentiation from terrestrial vegetation.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS): 500 m reach with 10 transects; assessment of bank/top vegetation and habitat features.
  - Aquatic Macroinvertebrates: samples collected (QA results pending for CS2007; processing by CEH River Communities Group).
  - Hydrochemistry: on-site pH/conductivity; lab analysis for phosphate, nitrogen, and alkalinity (30 stream sites; 15 ponds).
- Training and standards: freshwater surveyors required to have aquatic plant taxonomy knowledge; RHS accredited; labs ISO 17025; QA biologist verifies adherence to methods.

## Data quality findings

### Aquatic Plants (Streams)
- Significant bias: main CS2007 surveys tended to record 1.9 fewer taxa than QA (P < 0.001).
- Mean taxon agreement between main and QA: 31%; 100% agreement only when a site had a single taxon.
- Most discrepancies due to rare taxa (over 80% of errors) and broader search/locating issues; seasonal and boundary-definition differences also contributed.
- QA scores tended to be higher by about 5.6 units on average, though not statistically significant.
- Even on the same day, substantial differences in species lists observed (57% agreement in some cases).
- Implication: plant data are difficult to repeat; use CS2007 main results without correction but treat QA as a baseline for future improvements; focus trainings on bryophytes, algae, and grasses; emphasize precise relocation of survey stretches; aim to complete QA within two weeks of main survey.

### River Habitat Survey (RHS)
- Bridges/culverts counts agree in about 70% of sites; discrepancies typically ±1 due to slight relocation of the 500 m reach.
- Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) values varied between CS and QA; main surveys generally scored higher by about 6.9 units (significant bias, P < 0.001).
- Discrepancies largely due to subjective judgments on bank-vegetation structure (e.g., moorland vegetation classified differently).
- Upland/moorland areas showed greatest disparity due to vegetation classification ambiguities.
- No CS2000 QA data available; thus CS2007 RHS treated as baseline for bias, proceeding with caution.

### Hydrochemistry
- Rank correlations between QA and main surveys were highly significant for all parameters: soluble reactive phosphorus (0.89), total oxidised nitrogen (0.79), alkalinity (0.97), pH (0.74), conductivity (0.97).
- TON showed some variation between main and QA, partly due to a two-month gap between surveys on two ponds.
- Conclusion: field and lab procedures are consistently applied; keep QA and main surveys temporally close to improve comparability.

### Wetland Plants (Ponds)
- 16 ponds compared (main vs QA); no significant bias detected.
- Mean taxa agreement: 59%; 100% agreement at 5 ponds.
- Common misses included grasses and rushes; 36 taxa missed across surveys, with seven taxa missed at more than one site (notably Juncus effusus and Agrostis stolonifera).
- Training implication: enhance pond surveys to better detect grass-like and rush taxa; refine boundaries and seasonal timing issues.

## Discussion and implications for data governance
- Uncertainty in environmental measurements is inherent; QA provides a diagnostic of variability and informs change-detection confidence.
- Main sources of error: spatial (survey stretch location and boundaries), temporal (seasonal changes, prior disturbance), and inter-surveyor competence (thoroughness and taxonomic accuracy).
- For CS2007, QA was not always able to isolate timing effects; many QA activities occurred weeks after main surveys, reducing strength of conclusions about temporal error.
- The QA process helps identify which elements are most prone to misinterpretation or repeatability problems, guiding targeted improvements in training and protocols.
- Data governance takeaway: QA findings should drive protocol refinements, metadata standards (including time-difference, relocation accuracy, and surveyor identity), and scheduling practices to improve future data quality and comparability.

## Recommendations and future actions
- Training focus areas:
  - Improve identification skills for aquatic bryophytes and algae; increase awareness of inconspicuous grass-like species.
  - Emphasize exact replication of the original survey stretch and boundaries.
  - Strengthen RHS training to reduce subjective variation in bank vegetation classification.
- Protocol improvements:
  - Ensure QA surveys are conducted within two weeks of the main survey at the same site when possible.
  - Enhance methods for precise relocation of survey stretches and boundary definitions.
- Data use and interpretation:
  - Treat CS2007 freshwater QA as a baseline for subsequent surveys to gauge improvements in protocols and training.
  - Exercise caution in interpreting plant-based change signals due to repeatability issues; rely on hydrochemistry and RHS with awareness of potential biases.
- Documentation and metadata:
  - Maintain clear QA metadata (survey timing, site relocation accuracy, observer identity, and border definitions) to enable transparent uncertainty assessment.
- Anticipated next steps:
  - Freshwater macroinvertebrate QA results to be reported later; continue refining QA protocols based on CS2007 findings.

## Conclusion
- The CS2007 freshwater QA study provides a critical baseline for understanding data quality, uncertainty, and repeatability across streams and ponds.
- While some components (hydrochemistry) show strong repeatability, others (aquatic plants, RHS) reveal notable biases and subjective variation.
- The findings support targeted training, protocol refinements, and robust metadata practices to improve future data quality and the ability to detect genuine ecological change.
