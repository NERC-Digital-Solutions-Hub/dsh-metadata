# Summary of data regarding Colt Park drought experiment

- Overview
  - Drought experiment embedded within a long-term grassland restoration study at Colt Park meadows, Ingleborough National Nature Reserve (54°12'N, 2°21'W).
  - Restoration treatments: fertiliser application and seed addition (since 1990; with exceptions in 2009–2010 for fertiliser; 19 species used for seed addition).
  - Drought treatments (imposed in 2013): ambient (no shelter), drought (rain-out shelter), and control shelter (rain-out shelter with holes).
  - Hay cut on 16 July 2013 followed by cattle/sheep grazing.
  - Primary aim for analysts: enable data-driven analysis of how fertiliser, seed addition, and drought interact to influence plant, soil, and ecosystem carbon fluxes.

- Experimental design details
  - Treatments applied to plots organized into a grid matching prior restoration experiments (references to Smith et al. 2000; 2003; 2008; De Deyn et al. 2011).
  - Drought shelter period: 5 June – 10 July 2013.
  - Measurements cover plant community, soil chemistry and biology, microbe communities, and carbon fluxes.

  - General notes on data quality and structure
    - Missing data indicated as NA.
    - Measurements rely on standard equipment and established methods cited in the accompanying references (e.g., Ward et al. 2013; Bardgett et al. 1996; Brookes et al. 1985).

- Location and integration notes
  - Experimental plots tied to the Colt Park restoration layout and prior meadow restoration literature (Smith et al., 2000–2011).
  - Data capture integrates plant community structure, soil biogeochemistry, soil microbial communities, and greenhouse gas flux measurements to assess drought resistance and the influence of restoration treatments on carbon flux resilience.

- Potential analyses and insights for analysts
  - Assess how drought-induced changes in soil moisture relate to CO2 flux, Net Ecosystem Exchange, and respiration across fertiliser and seed addition treatments.
  - Investigate interactions between restoration treatments (fertiliser, seed) and drought on plant community composition, biomass allocation among functional groups, and species richness.
  - Explore microbial vs. plant community responses: link fungal/bacterial PLFA shifts (FUNGImcg, BACTmcg, FBratio) with soil chemistry (MBNmcg, DOCmcg, DONmcg, pH) and with carbon flux outcomes.
  - Model predictive relationships of drought shelter type and treatment combinations on ecosystem carbon flux metrics, accounting for temporal phases (before/during/after drought) and Julian day.
  - Utilize multi-omics/biogeochemical data (soil moisture, PAR, soil/air temperature, soil chemistry, microbial biomarkers, plant data) to identify drivers of drought resistance in carbon fluxes as reported in related literature (e.g., Cole et al. 2019).
  - Cross-reference 2012 restoration plots with 2013 drought outcomes to understand lag effects of restoration on drought resilience.
