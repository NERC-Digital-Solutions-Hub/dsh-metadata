# Relationship between the concentrations of dissolved organic matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a typical U.K. upland stream

- Purpose of study: Examine dissolved organic matter (DOM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations in a typical upland UK river, and distinguish freely dissolved PAHs from those associated with DOM.

- Sampling sites and timing:
  - Five sites along the River Wyre (upland and agricultural catchment with organic-rich soils).
  - Four sampling events: 19 Aug 2010; 6 Dec 2010; 6 Mar 2011; 6 Jun 2011.
  - Sample volumes: 5 L water for PAH analysis; 100 mL for DOC analysis.
  - Sample handling: bottles cleaned, stored at 5 °C, processed within 48 hours; stability tests indicated concentration stability for both freely and total dissolved PAHs over this period.

- DOC analysis method:
  - Filtration: 0.45 µm filtration.
  - DOC quantification: UV absorbance at 270 and 350 nm using a Tipping et al. (2009) algorithm.

- PAH analysis overview:
  - Each sample split into two sub-samples:
    - Total dissolved PAHs (TD-PAHs): measured in raw sample filtered through a GFF filter.
    - Freely dissolved PAHs (FD-PAHs): DOC-associated PAHs removed via DOC precipitation.
  - Freely dissolved PAHs isolation:
    - Precipitate DOC and DOC-associated PAHs with Al2(SO4)3 (0.4 g) in 5 mL Milli-Q water; adjust pH to 6 (optimal flocculation pH).
    - Remove flocculated DOC by filtration through GF-F filter.
    - Note: Al2(SO4)3 preferentially removes DOC and associated PAHs, but does not precipitate PAHs.
  - DOC-associated PAHs: obtained indirectly by subtracting FD-PAHs from TD-PAHs.
  - Blanks: laboratory blanks prepared with Milli-Q water in identical processing.
  - Recovery and QA:
    - Half-sample spiked with deuterated PAHs to monitor extraction and cleanup recovery; the other half processed identically.
    - Extracts pooled, dried, and prepared for analysis; internal standards (d10-acenaphthene and d12-benz[a]anthracene) added.
    - naphthalene initially analyzed but excluded due to high and variable blanks; not reported.
  - PAH target list: 28 PAHs quantified.
  - Instrumentation and analysis:
    - GC-MS: Agilent GC 6890N with Agilent MSD 5973N, EI mode, Selected Ion Monitoring (SIM).
    - Column and conditions: HT8 column, helium carrier gas, specific temperature program details provided; 20 µL injections after solvent venting.
    - Data handling: internal standards and blanks used to assess recovery; samples and blanks treated identically.

- Data processing details:
  - For each sample: two parallel pathways (TD-PAHs and FD-PAHs) with QA checks via spiked deuterated standards.
  - Concentrations expressed for freely dissolved, total dissolved, and DOC-associated PAHs.
  - Use of internal standards and recovery corrections to ensure data quality.

- Key analyses and references:
  - Method references for DOM quantification by UV absorbance: Tipping et al. 2009.
  - Method for DOC–PAH complexation and flocculation: Laor & Rebhun 1997.
  - General approach: separation of freely dissolved and DOC-associated PAHs via precipitation and filtration, followed by GC-MS quantification.

- Limitations and considerations:
  - Naphthalene excluded from reported results due to consistently high and variable blanks.
  - Some potential analytical challenges acknowledged with DOC precipitation and multi-step extraction; QA steps included to monitor recovery and contamination.

- Data governance and stewardship implications:
  - Data types to capture: DOC concentrations, TD-PAH concentrations, FD-PAH concentrations, DOC-associated PAHs, internal standard recoveries, blanks, and QA metrics.
  - Metadata requirements:
    - Site identifiers and coordinates, river system description, sampling dates and times, sample volumes, filtration methods, pH adjustments, reagents, and storage conditions.
    - Detailed analytical methods, instrument settings, and data processing workflows to ensure reproducibility.
  - Quality assurance documentation:
    - Recovery rates from deuterated internal standards, blank levels, and final data correction procedures.
  - Documentation of limitations:
    - Exclusion of certain analytes (e.g., naphthalene) due to data quality concerns; acknowledgment of potential biases in DOM–PAH partitioning due to method-specific steps.
  - Data sharing considerations:
    - Ensure transparency of sample processing steps, QA procedures, and any deviations from standard protocols; provide access to method references and instrumentation details to enable reproducibility.
  - Alignment with governance aims:
    - The study’s structured separation of freely dissolved and DOM-associated PAHs supports standardized data sharing and comparability across datasets, aiding discovery and reuse by data users.
