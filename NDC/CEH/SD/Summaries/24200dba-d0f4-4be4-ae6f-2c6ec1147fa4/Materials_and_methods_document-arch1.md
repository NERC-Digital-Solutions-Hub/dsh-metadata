# Relationship between the concentrations of dissolved organic matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a typical U.K. upland stream.

## Objective
- Investigate the relationship between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the River Wyre, a typical upland UK stream draining organic-rich soils.
- Quantify total dissolved PAHs as well as freely dissolved PAHs and determine DOC-associated PAHs.

## Sampling design and sample handling
- Five sampling sites along the River Wyre (northwest England) spanning upland and agricultural areas.
- Four sampling events: 19 Aug 2010; 6 Dec 2010; 6 Mar 2011; 6 Jun 2011.
- At each site/event: 5 L water collected for PAH analysis; 100 mL collected for DOC analysis.
- Samples stored at 5 °C and processed within 48 h; stability confirmed for freely and total dissolved PAHs under these conditions.

## DOC analysis
- Filtration through a 0.45 µm filter.
- DOC concentrations estimated from UV absorbance at 270 and 350 nm using a method from Tipping et al. (2009).

## PAH analysis: total and freely dissolved
- Each sample split into two equal sub-samples:
  - Total dissolved PAHs: analyzed directly on the raw sample filtered through a GF/F filter.
  - Freely dissolved PAHs: DOC and DOC-associated PAHs precipitated by adding Al2(SO4)3 (0.4 g in 5 mL water) and adjusting pH to 6; flocculated material removed by filtration through GF-F.
- Rationale: Al2(SO4)3 efficiently removes DOC and associated PAHs without precipitating PAHs themselves.
- DOC-associated PAHs estimated indirectly as total minus freely dissolved PAHs.
- Blanks included (Milli-Q water treated identically).

## Extraction, cleanup, and GC-MS analysis
- Each sample half spiked with deuterated PAHs to monitor recovery; underwent liquid-liquid extraction with 80 mL dichloromethane (DCM) three times.
- Extracts pooled, dried (Na2SO4), reduced to ~1 mL, cleaned on alumina column, and eluted with 10 mL DCM.
- Extracts reduced to ~0.5 mL, spiked with internal standards (d10-acenaphthene and d12-benz[a]anthracene).
- Analyzed for 28 target PAHs (naphthalene excluded due to high/variable blanks).
- Instrumentation: GC-MS (Agilent 6890N/5973N) with a HT8 column, 20 µL injections, solvent vent mode, helium carrier gas.
- Inlet/temperature program: PTV inlet at ~20 °C; ramp to 350 °C, then back to 300 °C; oven program from 50 °C to 330 °C with multiple ramps; transfer line at 350 °C; EI mode with selected ion monitoring (SIM).
- QA: laboratory blanks; use of deuterated internal standards for recovery; recovery compounds monitored.
