# Relationship between the concentrations of dissolved organic matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a typical U.K. upland stream.

## Objective and study context
- Investigates the relationship between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a typical U.K. upland river (River Wyre).
- Spans five sampling sites along the river and four sampling events between August 2010 and June 2011.
- Samples collected from upstream to downstream areas influenced by upland and agricultural soils; emphasis on DOM and PAH partitioning (free vs. DOC-associated).

## Sampling design and collection
- Five sites along the River Wyre.
- Four sampling events: 19 August 2010; 6 December 2010; 6 March 2011; 6 June 2011.
- For each site/event: 5 L water samples for PAH analysis and 100 mL samples for DOC analysis.
- Sample handling: clean amber glass bottles with Teflon-lined lids; store at 5 °C and process within 48 hours; preliminary tests confirmed stability of freely and total dissolved PAHs over this period.

## DOC analysis
- Filtration: samples filtered through a 0.45 µm filter.
- DOC determination: UV absorbance at 270 and 350 nm using an algorithm from Tipping et al. 2009.

## PAH analysis: fractionation into freely dissolved and total dissolved
- Each sample split into two equal sub-samples for:
  - Total dissolved PAHs (sum of freely dissolved plus DOC-associated).
  - Freely dissolved PAHs (DOC-associated PAHs removed).
- Freely dissolved PAHs isolation:
  - Add 0.4 g Al2(SO4)3 dissolved in 5 mL Milli-Q water; adjust to pH 6 (optimal flocculation pH for Al2(SO4)3).
  - Flocculate DOC and associated PAHs; remove flocculated material by GF-F filtration.
  - Al2(SO4)3 efficiently removes DOC and tends not to precipitate PAHs.
- Total dissolved PAHs measurement: raw sample filtered through a GF/F filter.
- DOC-associated PAHs: calculated indirectly as total dissolved PAHs minus freely dissolved PAHs.
- Blanks: laboratory blanks prepared in parallel with samples.

## Extraction, cleanup, and analytical workflow
- For each sub-sample, half is spiked with deuterated PAHs to monitor recovery.
- Extraction: liquid–liquid extraction with 80 mL dichloromethane (DCM) three times.
- Combine extracts, dry with anhydrous Na2SO4, reduce to ~1 mL.
- Cleanup: alumina-based column (activated at 550 °C) with a small amount of anhydrous Na2SO4.
- Elution: 10 mL DCM.
- Concentration: reduce to ~0.5 mL; spike with internal standards (d10-acenaphthene and d12-benz[a]anthracene).
- Target compounds: 28 PAHs plus recovery compounds; naphthalene included originally but excluded later due to high/variable blanks.

## Instrumental analysis
- GC-MS: Agilent GC 6890N coupled to Agilent MSD 5973N; 20 µL injections in solvent vent mode.
- Column: HT8 (50 m × 0.22 mm ID × 0.25 µm film).
- Carrier gas: helium at 2 mL/min.
- Inlet: programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) at 20 °C initially, then ramp to 350 °C, hold, then cool.
- Oven program: 50 °C hold, ramp to 200 °C, to 250 °C, to 330 °C with various ramp rates, hold at 330 °C.
- Detector: EI mode with selected ion monitoring (SIM); quadrupole 150 °C; source 230 °C.

## QA/QC and data quality
- Use of deuterated internal standards to monitor recovery.
- Inclusion of laboratory blanks.
- Exclusion of naphthalene due to persistent blank issues.
- Method details allow calculation of DOC-associated PAHs by difference between total and freely dissolved fractions.

## Data products and potential applications
- Data generated or derivable:
  - DOC concentrations (via UV absorbance).
  - Freely dissolved PAHs concentrations.
  - Total dissolved PAHs concentrations.
  - DOC-associated PAHs concentrations (by difference: total minus freely dissolved).
  - Recovery metrics from deuterated standards; internal standard responses.
- Potential use: understanding partitioning of PAHs between DOM and aqueous phase, and informing models of PAH fate in upland river systems.
