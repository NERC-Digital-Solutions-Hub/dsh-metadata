# Relationship between the concentrations of dissolved organic matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a typical U.K. upland stream

## Study design and sampling
- Five sites along the River Wyre in the northwest of England (upland and agricultural catchment; soils rich in organic matter).
- Four sampling events: 19 Aug 2010; 6 Dec 2010; 6 Mar 2011; 6 Jun 2011.
- Sample collection: 5 L water for PAH analysis at each site per event; 100 mL for DOC analysis; clean amber glass bottles with Teflon-lined lids.
- Sample handling: stored at 5 °C and processed within 48 hours; stability of freely and total dissolved PAHs prior to processing confirmed.

## DOC analysis and data captured
- Filtration: samples filtered through a 0.45 µm filter.
- DOC quantification: UV absorbance at 270 and 350 nm using an algorithm from Tipping et al. 2009.
- Data captured: DOC concentrations (mg/L or equivalent units) linked to site, date, and sample ID.

## PAH analysis and data captured
- Sample division: each sample split into two sub-samples for total dissolved PAHs and freely dissolved PAHs.
- Freely dissolved PAHs isolation: DOC and DOC-associated PAHs precipitated with Al2(SO4)3 at pH ~6 (flocculation), DOC removed by filtration through GF-F; Al2(SO4)3 preferentially removes DOC-bound PAHs without precipitating PAHs.
- Total dissolved PAHs: measured in raw sample filtered through GFF.
- Determination of DOC-associated PAHs: calculated as total dissolved minus freely dissolved PAHs.
- Quality controls: lab blanks processed like samples.

## Extraction, cleanup, and analytical method
- Internalization and recovery: each sample portion spiked with deuterated PAHs to monitor extraction and cleanup recovery; additional internal standards (d10-acenaphthene and d12-benz[a]anthracene) added before GC-MS.
- Extraction: liquid–liquid extraction with 80 mL dichloromethane (DCM) three times; extracts pooled and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate.
- Concentration and cleanup: reduced to ~1 mL, cleaned on an alumina column with a small amount of sodium sulfate; PAHs eluted with 10 mL DCM; evaporated to ~0.5 mL; final spiking for GC-MS.
- Target compounds: 28 PAHs (naphthalene later excluded due to high/variable blanks; not reported).
- Instrumentation: GC-MS (Agilent 6890N/5973N) with EI mode, selected ion monitoring; internal standard and recovery monitoring included.
- Chromatography specifics: HT8 column, helium as carrier; detailed inlet, temperature ramp, and program parameters provided.
- Data tied to: each sample, with blanks and recovery compounds for QA/QC.

## Data quality, provenance, and reproducibility
- QC measures: use of deuterated surrogates to monitor recovery; blanks processed identically; exclusion of problematic analyte (naphthalene) due to blanks.
- Stability and storage: samples kept at 5 °C; processing within 48 hours; validated stability for both freely and total dissolved PAHs.
- Documentation basis: methods anchored to prior work (Tipping et al. 2009 for UV-DOC quantification; Laor & Rebhun 1997 for Al2(SO4)3 flocculation concept).

## Data relationships and potential use for data strategy
- Generated data types: DOC concentration, freely dissolved PAH concentrations, total dissolved PAH concentrations, and DOC-associated PAH concentrations (derived).
- Metadata considerations: site identifiers, sampling dates, volumes, processing timelines, filtration and analytical methods, QA/QC results (blanks, recoveries, internal standards).
- Implications for data governance: emphasis on data lineage, method reproducibility, and cross-study comparability for dissolved organic matter and PAH datasets; methodological transparency supports data discoverability and reuse.
