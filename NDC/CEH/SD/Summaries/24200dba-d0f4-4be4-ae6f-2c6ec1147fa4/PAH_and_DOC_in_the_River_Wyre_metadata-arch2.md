# Site

- The document presents PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) concentration measurements across five sites and four seasons, focusing on dissolved and DOC-associated forms as well as the DOC content and a derived partition coefficient.
- Sites included: Marshaw Wyre, Abbeystead, Dolphinholm, Six Arches, Garstang.
- Seasons covered: 19 Aug 2010; 6 Dec 2010; 6 Mar 2011; 6 Jun 2011.

## Data captured

- total dissolved PAHs concentration [ng L⁻¹]
- freely dissolved PAHs concentration [ng L⁻¹]
- DOC-bound PAHs concentration [ng L⁻¹]
- DOC concentration [mg L⁻¹]
- log K_DOC (water–DOC partition coefficient)

## Variables and calculations

- c_total: total dissolved PAHs concentration (ng L⁻¹)
- c_free: freely dissolved PAHs concentration (ng L⁻¹)
- c_DOC: DOC concentration (mg L⁻¹)
- log K_DOC is derived from PAH and DOC concentrations (details imply a relationship among c_total, c_free, and c_DOC)
- The log K_DOC represents the strength of partitioning between the water phase and DOC.

## Data workflow and quality

- Data are organized by site and season with standardized PAH and DOC measurements.
- Analyses follow standardised methods to produce comparable outputs (e.g., categorising PAHs by dissolved forms and assessing partitioning).
- Data likely undergo verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation prior to analysis and visualization.

## Usage and implications

- Enables monitoring of environmental health over time and across locations using consistent metrics.
- Supports assessment of PAH distribution among dissolved, freely dissolved, and DOC-associated forms.
- Facilitates comparison with environmental standards and policy performance, and informs regulatory decisions.

## Data storage and availability

- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals as part of routine monitoring practices.
- Emphasis on making underlying data accessible to others to enhance reuse and value.

## Particular challenges

- Increasing the value of PAH monitoring data by integrating with other relevant datasets (moving beyond single-use analyses).
- Ensuring others can access the underlying data used to produce final outputs, promoting transparency and reusability.
