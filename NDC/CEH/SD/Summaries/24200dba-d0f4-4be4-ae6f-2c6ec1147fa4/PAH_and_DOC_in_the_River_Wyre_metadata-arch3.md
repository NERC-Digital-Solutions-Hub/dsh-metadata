# PAHs in Water: Total, Freely Dissolved, and DOC-Bound Concentrations Across Sites and Seasons

- Sites and seasons
  - Site 1: Marshaw Wyre
  - Site 2: Abbeystead
  - Site 3: Dolphinholm
  - Site 4: Six Arches
  - Site 5: Garstang
  - Season 1: 19 August 2010
  - Season 2: 6 December 2010
  - Season 3: 6 March 2011
  - Season 4: 6 June 2011

- Measured variables and units
  - Total dissolved PAHs concentration: ng L-1
  - Freely dissolved PAHs concentration: ng L-1
  - DOC-bound PAHs concentration: ng L-1
  - DOC concentration: mg L-1
  - log K_DOC: logarithmised water-DOC partition coefficient

- Conceptual relationships
  - log K_DOC is derived from PAH and DOC concentrations
  - Key concentrations defined:
    - c_total: total dissolved PAHs (ng L-1)
    - c_free: freely dissolved PAHs (ng L-1)
    - c_DOC: DOC concentration (mg L-1)

- Purpose and use in monitoring frameworks
  - Tracks distribution of PAHs between dissolved, freely dissolved, and DOC-associated forms
  - Provides data for assessment across multiple sites and seasons
  - Establishes quantities used to compute the water-DOC partitioning coefficient

- Data handling and interpretation notes
  - Clear definitions of each concentration facilitate comparability
  - Calculation of log K_DOC relies on the defined c_total, c_free, and c_DOC values
  - DOC concentration is an essential parameter for understanding PAH partitioning behavior

- Relevance to policy and decision-making (as it informs monitoring)
  - Supports evaluation of environmental health regarding PAH presence and partitioning
  - Aids in interpreting PAH bioavailability and transport potential through its partitioning with DOC

- Metadata and governance considerations (implied for monitoring use)
  - Consistent units and clear variable definitions aid data quality and governance
  - Documentation of sampling sites, dates, and measurement methods is critical for transparency and reproducibility
