# Relationship between the concentrations of dissolved organic matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a typical U.K. upland stream

## Aim
- Examine the relationship between dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentrations and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a typical U.K. upland stream by distinguishing freely dissolved and DOM-associated PAHs and relating them to DOC levels.

## Sampling sites and collection
- Location: River Wyre, northwest England; five sites along the river draining upland and agricultural areas with organic-rich soils.
- Sample types and volumes: 5 L water samples for PAH analysis from each site; 100 mL samples for DOC analysis.
- Sampling schedule: Four events on 19 Aug 2010, 6 Dec 2010, 6 Mar 2011, and 6 Jun 2011.
- Storage and processing: Samples kept at 5 °C and processed within 48 hours; stability of free and total dissolved PAHs confirmed in preliminary tests.

## DOC analysis
- Filtration: Samples filtered through 0.45 µm filters.
- Measurement: DOC concentrations determined from UV absorbance at 270 and 350 nm using an algorithm from Tipping et al. (2009).

## PAH analysis
- Sub-sampling: Each water sample split into two equal sub-samples for total dissolved PAHs and freely dissolved PAHs.
- Freely dissolved PAHs: DOC and DOC-associated PAHs precipitated with Al2(SO4)3 (0.4 g in 5 mL Milli-Q water) at pH 6, then removed by GF-F filtration; Al2(SO4)3 chosen for efficient DOC removal and minimal PAH precipitation.
- Total dissolved PAHs: Raw sample filtered through a GF/F filter to obtain the total dissolved fraction.
- DOC-associated PAHs: Calculated indirectly as total dissolved PAHs minus freely dissolved PAHs.
- Quality control: Laboratory blanks prepared by treating Milli-Q water identically to samples.

## Extraction and cleanup
- Procedure: Each portion split again; spiked with deuterated PAHs to monitor recovery; liquid–liquid extraction with 80 mL dichloromethane (DCM) three times.
- Post-extraction: Extractions combined, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, reduced to ~1 mL, cleaned on a column with activated alumina and Na2SO4, eluted with 10 mL DCM.
- Concentration and internal standards: Evaporated under nitrogen, reconstituted to ~0.5 mL, spiked with d10-acenaphthene and d12-benz[a]anthracene as internal standards.

## GC-MS analysis
- Instrumentation: Agilent GC 6890N coupled to Agilent MSD 5973N; 20 µL injection in solvent vent mode.
- Column and conditions: HT8 column (50 m × 0.22 mm ID, 0.25 µm); helium carrier; PTV inlet at 20 °C, ramp to 350 °C; oven program with multiple increases up to 330 °C and hold.
- Detection: EI-mode with selected ion monitoring (SIM); quadrupole 150 °C, source 230 °C.
- Notes: Naphthalene analyzed initially but later excluded due to high and variable blanks; monitored using internal standards.

## Data interpretation and QA/QC
- Outcome measure: Concentrations of freely dissolved PAHs and total dissolved PAHs; DOC-associated PAHs derived by subtraction.
- Blanks and recoveries: Laboratory blanks and deuterated/internal standards used to assess recovery and method performance; internal standards used to monitor extraction and cleanup efficiency.
