# Relationship between the concentrations of dissolved organic matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a typical U.K. upland stream

- Objective and study context
  - Investigates the relationship between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a typical upland UK stream (River Wyre) draining upland and agricultural areas.
  - Sampling conducted at five sites along the river during four events between August 2010 and June 2011.

- Sampling sites, events, and sample handling
  - Five sites along the River Wyre; samples collected using clean amber glass bottles with Teflon-lined lids.
  - PAH samples: 5 L per site per event for PAH analysis.
  - DOC samples: 100 mL per site per event.
  - Samples kept at 5 °C and processed within 48 hours; stability of freely and total dissolved PAHs confirmed over this period.

- DOC analysis method
  - Filtration through a 0.45 µm filter.
  - DOC concentrations determined from UV absorbance at 270 and 350 nm using a Tipping et al. (2009) algorithm.

- PAH analysis: separating freely dissolved and DOC-associated PAHs
  - Each sample divided into two sub-samples:
    - Total dissolved PAHs: processed directly after filtration (via GF-F filter for the filtrate).
    - Freely dissolved PAHs: DOC and DOC-associated PAHs precipitated with Al2(SO4)3 (0.4 g in 5 mL water), adjusted to pH 6 for optimal flocculation, then removal of the flocculated material by filtration.
  - Rationale: Al2(SO4)3 efficiently removes DOC but does not precipitate PAHs.

- Calculation approach and QA controls
  - DOC-associated PAHs calculated indirectly: total dissolved PAHs minus freely dissolved PAHs.
  - Blanks treated identically to samples to monitor contamination.
  - Quality controls: spiking with deuterated PAHs to monitor extraction/cleanup recovery; internal standards used (d10-acenaphthene and d12-benz[a]anthracene).

- Sample processing: extraction and cleanup
  - Each sample portion subjected to liquid–liquid extraction with 80 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) three times.
  - Combined extracts dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, reduced to ~1 mL, and cleaned on an alumina-based column with a small amount of sodium sulfate.
  - Target PAHs eluted with 10 mL DCM, concentrated to ~0.5 mL, spiked again with internal standards, and prepared for GC-MS analysis.

- Instrumentation and analytical conditions
  - GC-MS: Agilent GC 6890N with Agilent MSD 5973N; 20 µL injections; HT8 column (50 m, 0.22 mm ID, 0.25 µm).
  - Carrier gas: helium at 2 mL/min.
  - Inlet: programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) at 20 °C for 0.51 min, ramp to 350 °C, then to 300 °C/min and hold.
  - Oven program: isothermal at 50 °C, then ramp to 200 °C, 250 °C, 330 °C with final hold.
  - Detector: EI-mode with selected ion monitoring; quadrupole at 150 °C; ion source at 230 °C.
  - Internal standards: d10-acenaphthene and d12-benz[a]anthracene.

- Targets and exclusions
  - Analyzed 28 PAHs plus recovery compounds.
  - Naphthalene initially included but later excluded due to high and variable blank levels.
