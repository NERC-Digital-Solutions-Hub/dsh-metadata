# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Objective: Standardise woodland surveying to classify and describe woodlands, creating structured data across sites and networks.
- Audience: Field survey teams and data leaders responsible for implementing data-driven woodland stewardship and analysis.

## Data system scope and structure

- Site-level framework: Each survey site yields a complete site description and habitats dataset plus data from multiple plots within the site.
- Plot architecture: Each site contains up to 16 plots arranged within a 14.14 m × 14.14 m square (200 m2 total); within this, nested smaller plots are used (2 m × 2 m up to 10 m × 10 m) to capture ground flora and other attributes.
- Data components (per site and per plot):
  - Ground flora: presence/absence and percent cover for total vascular plants across quadrats; bryophyte collection for broader flora.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: diameter at breast height (DBH), species, heights, and quadrant-based sampling (diagonally opposite quarters for saplings and shrubs).
  - Plot description and habitats: slopes, aspect, and a detailed attribute set describing habitat types and site features.
  - Soil data: central plot pit and auger cores for a composite topsoil sample; horizon-by-horizon soil interpretation (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C) using standardized descriptors.
  - Site-wide habitat and marginal land use forms: comprehensive documentation of the surrounding terrain, boundaries, and land-use context.
  - Management indicators: planted hardwoods, coppice status, stumps (new/old), pollards, brash/wood residuals, etc.
  - Faunal and flora indicators: selective records for birds, mammals, invertebrates, macrofungi, and other signs (sightings, tracks, droppings, etc.).

## Data collection workflow and permissions

- Preparation and planning:
  - Create an outline of survey operations to minimise travel, with base-site considerations and access permissions.
  - Field equipment provided, with checklists to ensure completeness (maps, forms, sampling gear, labels, etc.).
- Access and permissions:
  - Permission to survey is obtained at site level; instructions cover owner engagement, public-relations, and contingencies when permission is refused.
  - If permission cannot be obtained, backup sites and map data are used.
- Field logistics:
  - Identify optimal entry points to minimise walking distance and avoid disturbing owners.
  - Use of fixed map controls and compass bearings to locate sampling points within about 20 m accuracy, with explicit procedures to reduce bias in point selection.
- Recording order:
  - Ground flora data collected first to minimise disturbance, followed by trees/saplings/shrubs and soil data, with flexibility in order if more convenient.

## Data collection methods and data types

- Ground flora (2 m × 2 m up to 14.14 m × 14.14 m):
  - Record presence/absence and percent cover for all vascular plants; collect bryophytes from the full plot for herbarium reference (notes on identification and specimen collection).
  - Use the predetermined quadrat framework to ensure unbiased sampling across scales.
- Trees, saplings, shrubs:
  - Trees >5 cm DBH recorded (species and DBH); saplings and shrubs recorded only in specific quadrants (diagonally opposite quarters 1 and 3) with the same measurement conventions.
  - Height of the largest tree measured.
- Plot description and habitats:
  - Document slope, aspect, and a structured set of habitat attributes; include a sketch of the ground profile along the line of maximum slope.
  - Provide additional narrative in the comments field when needed.
- Soil data and interpretation:
  - Small pit and auger cores to sample the top 10–15 cm and deeper horizons as feasible; composite topsoil sample collected.
  - Soil profiles interpreted using a standardized horizon scheme (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) with coded attributes for texture, colour, moisture, structure, and presence of organic material or deposition layers.
  - Limitations acknowledged: partial auger depth, variable horizon development, and the need to supplement with field notes for atypical profiles.
- Site-level description and habitats:
  - A separate site form captures broader habitat context, boundary types, and marginal land-use categories.
  - Cross-checks to ensure consistency between plot-level and site-level forms (all-or-nothing attribute recording).

## Data quality, standardisation, and governance

- Standardised forms and codes:
  - Site Description and Habitat Form; Plot Description and Habitat Form; Soil Data form; and Herbarium instructions ensure uniform data capture.
  - Codes and attribute numbers are documented and linked to both site and plot forms to enable integrated data handling.
- Data validation and consistency:
  - Systematic checks recommended to ensure no omissions and logical consistency between site and plot attributes.
  - The same code series is used across site and plot forms to enable unified data processing and later analysis.
- Herbarium and specimen standards:
  - Collect type specimens for species encountered; ensure robust labeling and specimen integrity for future verification.
  - Clear guidelines to avoid misidentification by requiring specimens when in doubt.
- Data longevity and ownership:
  - Emphasis on capturing comprehensive data because the data are intended for long-term use and cross-site comparability.
  - Public relations guidance to avoid misperceptions about land purchase or research motives.

## Data outputs, formats, and delivery

- Data packaging:
  - Completed forms, herbarium samples, and soil samples are to be packed into labeled boxes and shipped by post using prepaid postage labels.
  - Clear procedures for stapling and bagging forms, labeling soil and bryophyte samples, and ensuring secure packaging.
- Data traceability:
  - Each site and plot is uniquely coded; data are organized to facilitate punching, storage, and future re-use in analyses.

## Soil science and interpretation (summary)

- Practical approach:
  - A limited set of soil properties is measured in the field (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis) to balance depth of data with project scale (1648 plots).
  - Numerical soil description complements descriptive horizons to support quantitative analysis.
- Pedological framework:
  - Emphasis on Podzolic soils, their leaching dynamics, and transitions to hydromorphic and skeletal soils, with recognition of calcareous soils in chalk/limestone regions.
  - Horizon-by-horizon interpretation guides (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C) with attributes for colour, texture, moisture, structure, and deposition layers.
- Horizon-typing and data capture:
  - Depths are recorded as from-to for horizons; horizon boundaries are described by color, texture, and presence of organic material and mineral components.
  - Underlying material recorded when relevant, with notes on sample depth limitations due to auger length.

## Appendices and tools (resources for data leaders)

- Instructions for herbarium specimen collection (Appendix I) and examples of completed forms (Appendices II–V).
- Plot and site description/habitat forms (Appendix VI) with detailed attribute codes and interpretation guidelines.
- Equipment checklists and data-handling templates to promote consistency across field teams.

## Practical takeaways for data leadership and strategy

- Build a robust, standardized data framework:
  - Use the outlined site/plot data models, forms, and code sets to ensure interoperability across surveys and networks.
- Emphasise governance and data quality:
  - Implement validation checks, maintain rigorous provenance through herbarium and specimen records, and ensure complete documentation for future analyses.
- Align field methods with long-term data objectives:
  - Prioritise comprehensive, repeatable data collection that supports cross-site comparisons, environmental monitoring, and woodland classification.
- Foster collaboration and data sharing:
  - Leverage the structure to enable cross-network data integration, sharing of metadata, and consistent interpretation of soil, flora, and habitat data.
