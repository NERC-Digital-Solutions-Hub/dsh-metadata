# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

## Overview
- National Woodland Survey 2002 Field Handbook outlines procedures for field survey of woodland sites, including instructions on locating sites, obtaining permissions, recording plot and site data, soil sampling, and data handling.
- Defines four datasets per site (vegetation plot, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot description/habitat, and soil sample) plus a site-level description. Total: 16 plots per site (arranged on a 14.14 m grid) and a site description form.
- Emphasizes standardized methods, repeatability, and documentation to enable future data discovery and reuse.

## Data Governance and Standards
- Clear permission and ownership recording: obtain landowner permission, document owner names/addresses, and provide owners with copies of results.
- Publishing mindset: produce usable, shareable datasets with accompanying metadata.
- Standardized data collection forms and codes: site and plot forms use sequential attribute codes; cross-form consistency checks between site and plot data are required.
- Per-site data packaging: data sheets stapled into a site folder; soil samples dispatched to CEH Merlewood with proper labeling and tracking.
- Documentation for data provenance: recording dates, recorder initials, plot/site identifiers, and observation context on forms.

## Data Collection and Structure
- Site and plot setup:
  - 16 random sampling points per site, mapped on multiple scales; relocation aims for accuracy and avoidance of bias.
  - GPS discouraged for plot relocation to prevent introducing non-original relocation bias.
- Recording forms (three per site, plus site form):
  - Vegetation plot: ground flora presence/absence in five quadrats (2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m), with % cover estimates and bryophyte notes.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species ID, DBH (cm), and height data across plot quarters; saplings/shrubs recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3).
  - Plot description and habitats: presence/absence attributes for habitat features; include free text in comments.
  - Soil sampling: composite soil sample from plot center (top 15 cm); double labeling and careful bagging to prevent data loss.
- Data collection workflow per plot:
  - Forest ground flora recorded first to minimize disturbance.
  - Four quadrats (2x2 m, then progressively larger) documented with presence/absence of species; abundance estimates (nearest 5%) and total cover ~100%.
  - Tree measurements: DBH >5 cm; height measured with clinometer or hypsometer; height/position corrections applied if slope considerations arise.
  - Soil sampling: center of plot, top 15 cm, minimum disturbance, proper labeling, and storage in site-specific boxes.
- Site completion:
  - Verify completeness of all forms, return equipment, and ensure soil samples and forms accompany the site description for data entry.
  - Gather an additional site-wide dataset: site description and habitats (in addition to plot data).

## Data Quality, Provenance, and Integrity
- Rigorous data quality controls:
  - Use of clutch pencils; waterproof recording sheets; careful consideration of recording order to preserve undisturbed state.
  - Structured data capture with explicit quadrat and subplot schemes to ensure consistency and comparability across plots and sites.
  - Cross-checks to ensure plot attributes exist on the site form and vice versa; verify no significant site areas are missed.
- Provenance and traceability:
  - Recorder initials, date, plot/site numbers, and measurement methods documented on all forms.
  - Detailed appendices provide definitions, measurement procedures, and data dictionaries to support reproducibility.
- Handling of uncertainty and bias:
  - Relocation bias minimized by standardized pacing, compass bearings, and map-to-ground scaling; avoidance of subjective plot placement decisions.
  - Documentation of relocation challenges and site changes (e.g., sites transformed by development) to contextualize data.

## Data Management, Storage, and Sharing
- Per-site archival process:
  - All data sheets and soil samples are consolidated into site folders in the field, prepared for data entry, and dispatched for processing.
- Soil samples:
  - Packaged in labeled, self-sealing bags; stored in cool conditions; dispatched to CEH Merlewood within a week where possible.
- Data lifecycle considerations:
  - Emphasis on data being "collected forever" with careful, comprehensive field documentation to enable long-term use and reanalysis.
  - Appendices outline field equipment, site maps, and laboratory protocols to support consistent data generation and subsequent analyses.

## Appendices and Documentation
- Appendix I & II: bryophyte lists and vegetation plot templates (for ground flora and project-specific species lists).
- Appendix III: Tree, sapling, and shrub data templates (including height, DBH, and plot-quarter conventions).
- Appendix IV: Site description and habitat forms; detailed attribute definitions and field recording conventions.
- Appendix V: Field equipment checklist (maps, permits, plotting equipment, soil bags, labels, etc.).
- Appendix VI: Soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH measurement, loss on ignition, sample preparation, and data recording steps).

## Key Challenges and Considerations for Data Stewards
- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities for later data reuse; ensure metadata captures research and management relevance.
- Timeliness of data delivery: permissions and field logistics can delay data capture and soil dispatch.
- Variation across systems and formats: harmonize data collected via multiple field teams and ensure consistent coding across site and plot forms.
- Handling large datasets and legacy databases: plan for integration, versioning, and long-term storage; maintain clear documentation of data lineage.
- Updating and maintenance: establish clear update mechanisms for future re-surveys, including how to document changes in land use or ownership.

## Practical Takeaways for Data Stewards
- Enforce governance around permissions, owner contacts, and sharing results with landowners.
- Maintain strict data standards: standardized forms, attribute codes, and cross-form consistency checks.
- Prioritize data quality through explicit measurement protocols, calibration, and bias-reduction strategies.
- Ensure robust data packaging, labeling, and traceability from field collection to data entry and storage.
- Preserve comprehensive metadata and appendices to support future discoverability and reuse of the dataset.
