# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971
## HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Overview: A comprehensive field protocol for surveying woodlands to classify habitat types, record ground flora, trees, shrubs, soils, and site-level habitats. Aims to produce standardized, reproducible data suitable for analysis, including maps, forms, and herbarium specimens. Emphasizes data quality, traceability of sources, and back-up sites if access is refused.

- Purpose and Scope
  - Systematic collection of data on ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, soils, and site habitats across multiple plots per site.
  - Use of standardized forms and appendices for consistent species coding, soil horizon interpretation, and habitat descriptors.
  - Creation of datasets suitable for downstream analysis and comparison across sites.

- Access, Permissions, and Public Relations
  - Obtain advance permission to survey each site; follow owner preferences and rely on tact and common sense.
  - If permission is denied, use backup sites and notify Merlewood with map and sampling details.
  - Provide owners with a brief description of the survey purpose; reassure that the Conservancy is not purchasing land and emphasize conservation value.

- Planning, Access, and Site Location
  - Locate woods using Ordnance Survey 1" and 22" maps; determine the best access points to minimize travel.
  - Use clear, marked tracks and minimize intrusion on fields or fences.
  - Plan coordination with Regional Office for cases with special access arrangements.

- Sampling Points and Locational Accuracy
  - Each site has multiple sampling points marked on the 22" map (often 16 points per site).
  - Locate ground sampling points with high accuracy (target within a 20 m radius of the intended point) while avoiding bias in selection.
  - Steps to locate a point: identify a control point near the intended ground point, orient the map and compass, measure and pace out bearings and distances, and confirm the ground point.

- Order of Recording Data
  - Four data sets per point and two soil samples per point:
    - Ground flora: presence/absence in five quadrat sizes (2x2 m up to 14x14 m) with % cover estimates.
    - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, diameter at breast height (DBH) for stems >5 cm, height for the largest tree, and sapling/shrub data in specified quadrants.
    - Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of habitat attributes, slope, aspect, and a sketch/description of the ground profile.
    - Soil data: small pit and auger samples for soil horizon analysis; composite top 10–15 cm sample for lab analyses.
  - Ground flora data should be collected first to minimize disturbance; trees/saplings and soil data follow in designated order.

- Ground Flora (a)
  - Establish a centre point and outline a sequence of concentric square plots (2x2 m up to 14x14 m).
  - Search each plot thoroughly for vascular plants and bryophytes; record species names (or field codes) in relevant quadrat size columns.
  - Collect bryophytes separately for a comprehensive vascular plant collection.
  - Use a standard herbarium for specimens requiring later verification; label specimens for later verification.
  - After recording all species across quadrats, estimate total ground flora cover using 100-point sampling logic; record cover and abundance, including litter, wood, rock, water, and bare ground.

- Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs (b)
  - Trees: record all stems >5 cm DBH within the full 14x14 m plot; measure DBH for each stem; mark dead trees with a "D".
  - Saplings: trees with height >50 cm but <5 cm DBH recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); same measurement approach.
  - Shrubs: recorded similarly to saplings; use the same quarter system.
  - Measure the tallest tree height in the plot using the provided height instrument; substitute a second tallest if the tallest is obstructed.

- Plot Descriptor and Habitats (c)
  - Record attributes describing habitat types and site characteristics within the plot; reference Appendix IV for definitions.
  - Include slope (with a specified instrument), aspect, and a sketch of the ground profile along the line of maximum slope.
  - Provide a comments column for additional relevant observations.

- Soil Data Collection and Interpretation (d)
  - Collect small pit and auger samples from the plot center to examine the upper 25–30 cm, with a composite 10–15 cm sample for laboratory analyses.
  - Primary soil parameters: pH, loss on ignition, and a simplified mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay percentages); retain sub-samples for potential future analyses.
  - Horizon-based interpretation: Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, and C horizons; document horizon depths, colors, textures, structure, moisture, and any gleying or mottling.
  - Use a standardized form to document horizon presence, thickness, color, texture, structure, moisture, and transition characteristics; if horizons are unclear or sample depth is limited, annotate accordingly.
  - Underlying material is recorded when present and distinguishable; indicate if auger depth (about 70 cm) limits horizon delineation.
  - Record earthworms or notable soil macrofauna as comments; in difficult cases, provide annotated diagrams to explain horizons.

- Site Description and Habitats (Total Site)
  - Complete a separate Site Description and Habitat Form for the whole site, integrating data from the plots and the inter-plot habitat features.
  - Use this form to document marginal land use, site boundaries, and broader landscape context.

- Completion and Packaging
  - After completing four data sheets and collecting two soil samples per plot across 16 plots, prepare a Site Description and Habitat Form for the entire site.
  - Staple sheets, label, and pack into three soil boxes and one bryophyte/herbarium box; ensure all materials are securely sealed and labeled with a postage label.
  - Post or deliver the parcels promptly to minimize handling and ensure data and samples are preserved.

- Herbarium Collection Instructions
  - Leaders are responsible for submitting a high-quality herbarium collection to demonstrate accuracy of species records.
  - Obtain type specimens for all species when possible; label with scientific names and codes used in field sheets; attach with tape to herbarium sheets.
  - Collect representative flowering shoots when possible; ensure consistent naming and avoid duplications by cross-checking specimens with field codes.
  - If in doubt, collect a specimen and archive it; duplicates can be merged later.

- Soil Analysis Methodology (Appendix II/III)
  - Recognize that a full suite of soil analyses is impractical for large surveys; adopt a limited, high-information approach combining descriptive soil horizon interpretation with a few key measurements (pH, LOI, particle size distribution).
  - Provide guidance on horizon interpretation (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C) and how to classify soils into major woodland soil types (podzolic, brown earths, calcareous types) based on drainage, parent material, leaching, and vegetation impacts.
  - Discuss the conceptual framework for podzolic, hydromorphic, skeletal, and calcareous soils, and how these influence vegetation and habitat interpretation.

- Equipment and Field Logistics
  - Standard field equipment: center pole with right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings, compasses, tapes, mats for recording, herbarium materials, soil sampling tools (mattock, trowel, auger), and field data sheets.
  - Field team responsibilities include data capture, specimen collection, and ensuring all equipment and samples are accounted for and properly labeled.

- Data Quality and Documentation
  - Emphasize unbiased point location and consistent data recording across plots and sites.
  - Track data sources and maintain metadata for reproducibility; ensure site and plot identifiers are consistently recorded on all forms.
  - Maintain a clear chain of custody for soil and bryophyte/herbarium samples; ensure all forms are complete and free of inconsistencies.
