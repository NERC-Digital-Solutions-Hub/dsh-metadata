# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

## Purpose and audience
- Provides a standardized methodology for field surveying of woodlands to support the National Woodland Survey 2002 and update the 1971 baseline.
- Aims to generate consistent, durable data on site conditions, vegetation, soils, and habitats that can be stored, shared, and reused across networks and over time.
- Emphasizes data-system thinking: capturing data in a way that supports discoverability, quality, and reuse, with potential co-ownership by data users (e.g., policy colleagues) and collaboration within the wider data community.

## Data scope and structures
- Four main data categories collected per site:
  - Vegetation plot: Ground flora presence/absence across nested quadrats (five sizes) with percentage cover estimates and bryophyte notes.
  - Trees, saplings and shrubs: Species, DBH, height measurements, and location by plot quarters; special handling for multi-stemmed individuals and dead trees.
  - Plot description and habitats: Presence/absence of habitat attributes within a 14.14 m x 14.14 m plot to generate frequency data.
  - Soil sampling: One composite soil sample per plot from the top 15 cm; labeling, packaging, and field notes.
- Per site: 16 plots (per site) and one site description; per plot: multiple data forms plus one soil sample.

## Data collection procedures and workflow
- Pre-field setup: site maps, location maps, permission letters, and standardized equipment; all teams must use identical methods.
- Site access and permissions: surveyors must obtain land access; owners may be identified and contacted using a standard introductory letter; owners receive a copy of results.
- Plot location and relocation: 16 random sampling points per site; relocation must minimize bias and maximize reproducibility; avoid GPS due to potential bias relative to historic plot locations; use compass bearings, distances, and enlarged maps to locate plots Ground-truthing and careful relocation are critical.
- Data recording sequence: start with vegetation ground flora (most undisturbed state), then complete other datasets; use pencil on waterproof forms; follow Appendix IV formats.
- Data forms and datasets:
  - Vegetation plot: track presence/absence across quadrats, then percent cover for all vascular plants plus bryophytes (common bryophytes prioritized).
  - Trees, saplings and shrubs: record species, DBH, heights, and repertory data per plot quarters; height measured via clinometer or hypsometer; adjustments for slope and distance as needed.
  - Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of attributes; use defined area rules for attributes that occupy defined spaces (e.g., ponds, glades).
  - Soil sampling: center of plot sampling with careful labeling; avoid contamination; record sampling problems.
- Site and plot completion: perform completeness checks, label and bundle forms, and document any notable changes or boundary issues; prepare for data entry.

## Data quality, standards, and metadata
- Data integrity rules:
  - Consistent coding and sequencing across site and plot forms; cross-check that plot attributes align with site attributes.
  - Ensure data integrity when plots or habitats have only partial areas recorded.
  - Height/DBH measurements follow specific definitions; dead trees are flagged distinctly.
- Standards and metadata:
  - Detailed attribute definitions and coding are provided in Appendices and the Site/Plot data forms (Appendix IV), enabling consistent interpretation and potential cross-site comparisons.
  - Unique identifiers for site and plot, with recorder initials and date, to ensure traceability and reproducibility.
- Quality controls and calibration:
  - Calibrate height measurement methods when possible; document calibration if not using a preferred instrument.
  - Soil sampling requires careful labeling (permanently and self-adhesive labels) and proper storage to prevent data loss.
- Data completeness and bias management:
  - Emphasizes unbiased plot relocation and avoidance of subjective site selection biases.
  - Acknowledges changes in sites over 30 years (e.g., motorway encroachment) and instructs to record such changes without attempting to re-survey restricted plots.

## Data management, governance, and lifecycle
- Data lifecycle: forms completed in the field, data entered and checked, site and plot data aggregated, soil samples dispatched to CEH Merlewood, and results archived for long-term use.
- Documentation and governance:
  - Appendices provide exhaustive definitions for habitat types, trees, regeneration, and other attributes.
  - Per-site and per-plot data forms use consistent coding schemes to facilitate integration and downstream analysis.
- Data sharing and reuse:
  - Emphasizes producing useful, reusable datasets for the wider woodland indicators program, with potential sharing with landowners and partner organizations.

## Practical considerations and risk management
- Permissions and stakeholder engagement:
  - Proactive engagement with landowners, using introductory letters; offer full results back to landowners.
- Safety and site restrictions:
  - Do not record plots on built-over land, railway embankments, or motorway verges; follow sensible, safe field practices.
- Data fidelity and timeliness:
  - Soil samples should arrive at the lab promptly (preferably within a week); delays should be avoided to prevent data loss.
  - Record and report any sampling problems to maintain data quality.

## Appendices and protocols (high-level)
- Appendix II: Vegetation plot data structure (ground flora) and example data fields.
- Appendix III: Tree, sapling, and shrub data structures.
- Appendix IV: Site description and habitat forms; detailed definitions and attribute codes.
- Appendix V: Field equipment list and per-site requirements.
- Appendix VI: Soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH, loss on ignition, sample preparation).
- Appendix Ia/Ib: Bryophyte lists (common species in pilot and GB contexts) to guide ground flora identification.

## Outputs and potential data use
- Provides rich, multi-layered woodland indicators at both plot and site levels (ground flora, tree structure, habitat attributes, soils, and marginal land use).
- Data designed for longitudinal comparison, tracking change against the 1971 baseline and informing policy, conservation, and land management decisions.
- Emphasizes data discoverability, consistency, and the ability to share results with landowners and partners.
