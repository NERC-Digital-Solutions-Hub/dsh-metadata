# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - Comprehensive field method for surveying woodlands to classify and document site descriptions, habitats, ground flora, trees and saplings, soils, and related features.
  - Designed for large numbers of sites with standardized data collection, documentation, and storage to support long-term discovery and use.

- Target users and governance implications
  - Users are field teams collecting hierarchical data (site, plots, and point-level observations) with standardized forms and codes.
  - Emphasizes data provenance, consistency, and traceability: site/plot numbers, recorder initials, dates, instrument readings, and coded attributes.
  - Outputs are organized into site-level and plot-level data packages, plus herbarium specimens and soil samples, intended for archival storage and future analysis.

- Access, permissions, and planning
  - Requires obtaining permission to survey each site; guidance provided on negotiating with landowners and managing access risks.
  - If access is denied, instructors provide backup site options and procedures for continuing work.
  - Emphasizes public relations and clear explanation of the project’s purpose to alleviate concerns about landowner rights.

- Survey planning and ground-truthing
  - Develop a practical, low-travel survey plan that minimizes disruption and uses centralized bases when possible.
  - Sites are located on road/1:10,000 to 1:2500 scales as required; advance information about sites is provided.
  - Procedure for locating 16 sampling points per site with high accuracy and minimal subjective bias:
    - Choose next point, identify a control point, orient map and compass, determine bearing with magnetic variation, pace out distance, and fix the ground point.
    - Maintain predetermined number of paces with strict adherence to directions to avoid bias from terrain or preferences.

- Data collection workflow and structure
  - At each site, four data sets and two sample series are collected for every sampling point, organized according to a clear workflow:
    - (a) Ground flora: presence/absence across five quadrat sizes, percent cover, and abundance estimates; comprehensive bryophyte collection from the plot; herbarium specimens collected for unidentified or key species.
    - (b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs: diameter at breast height (DBH) and height measurements for trees >5 cm DBH; saplings and shrubs recorded in diagonally opposite quadrants; dead or stumped individuals flagged; height of the largest tree recorded.
    - (c) Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of habitat attributes; a detailed topographic/ground profile sketch; aspect and slope data; definitions and attributes described in Appendix IV.
    - (d) Soil data: small pit and auger borings at the plot center for upper horizons; composite soil sample (top 10–15 cm); soil interpretation and horizon description following a standardized horizon framework.
  - After data capture, data sheets are checked for completeness, samples packed, and equipment logged before leaving the site.

- Site and plot documentation
  - Two principal forms per site:
    - Site Description and Habitats Form: detailed, site-wide observations and habitat classifications.
    - Plot Description and Habitats Form: a condensed version of the site form used for individual plots.
  - Data are organized with standardized codes (Code No for species, Code numbers for attributes, recorder initials, date, plot/Site numbers) to ease later data entry and data-punch processes.

- Ground flora quadrats and plant handling
  - Quadrat layout uses a center point with a right-angle guide to delineate nested plots (2 m × 2 m up to 14.14 m × 14.14 m) with markers indicating half-diagonal distances.
  - Species identification includes field codes; specimens of uncertain identity stored for herbarium verification.
  - Bryophytes are recorded comprehensively for the vascular plant survey only; bryophyte specimens are collected and stored separately.

- Trees, saplings, and habitat attributes
  - Trees: DBH measurements for stems >5 cm; multiple stems recorded separately but grouped for analysis; marking dead stems with a “D” in the data cell.
  - Saplings and shrubs: recorded in diagonally opposite plot quarters (quarters 1 and 3) with the same measurement conventions as trees.
  - A final height measurement is taken for the largest tree in the plot.

- Soil data collection and interpretation
  - Soil data are collected using a pit and auger to explore the upper horizons (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2) and underlying material.
  - A limited, standardized set of physical/chemical analyses is proposed (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis) to balance data quantity with the project’s scale.
  - Horizon interpretation emphasizes classification into podzolic, brown earth/brown forest soils, and calcareous soils, guided by field indicators and horizon characteristics.
  - Profiles are described using a horizon-by-horizon approach (depths, color, texture, structure, moisture, presence of organic layers, gleying, etc.), with attention to potential transitional or disturbed profiles.
  - Where full horizon data are not obtainable (e.g., depth limits of auger), gaps are noted.

- Site completion, packaging, and shipping
  - After all plots are surveyed, forms are checked for completeness, samples packed into labeled storage boxes, and documents sealed in polythene bags.
  - Four site boxes are used per site for organization; soil samples placed in three boxes, bryophytes in the remaining box.
  - Pre-paid, pre-addressed labels are used to ship the parcels by post to the designated facility.

- Herbarium collection and documentation
  - Each team leader must prepare a herbarium collection for species verification and to demonstrate accuracy.
  - Collect type specimens when possible, including flowering shoots; label specimens with the field name and enter the field code in the herbarium sheet.
  - Maintain consistent naming across field sheets and herbarium entries; duplicate identifications can be merged later if needed.
  - Comprehensive herbarium preparation is emphasized due to potential mis-identification errors.

- Appendices and equipment
  - Appendices include detailed instructions for herbarium specimens, examples of completed forms, plotting and site description forms, soil data collection instructions, and an equipment checklist.
  - A dedicated equipment list details measurement tools (compass, clinometers, tapes, poles, hammers, augers, dippers, etc.), storage bags, label materials, and transport gear.

- Long-term data context and challenges for data stewards
  - The document articulates a long-term data collection ethos, with the data described as being collected “forever” and intended for archival storage and future analysis.
  - Data stewardship considerations include: standardized data structures, clear provenance, consistent attribute coding, robust specimen handling, and careful back-up and archiving practices.
  - Challenges highlighted include coordinating permissions across multiple landowners, ensuring timely data collection, dealing with diverse systems and formats, and managing large volumes of data and samples over time.

- Key data governance takeaways for data stewards
  - Enforce standardized data collection templates (site and plot forms) with explicit metadata fields (site/plot numbers, recorder, date, instrument readings, and coded attributes) to enable interoperability and re-use.
  - Maintain data lineage and accountability through recorder initials, dates, and versioned forms; ensure traceability from field observations to archived samples (soil, herbarium) and their associated metadata.
  - Implement rigorous QA checks (completeness, consistency between site and plot forms) and preserve physical artifacts (herbarium sheets, soil samples) with clear labeling and packaging.
  - Plan for long-term storage and potential digitization, ensuring that the original structured data can be transformed into modern databases and shared research repositories.
