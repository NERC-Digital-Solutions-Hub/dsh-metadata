# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

## Aim and scope
- Establishes standardized data collection methods to demonstrate environmental condition and policy performance over time for woodlands.
- Provides a structured, repeatable protocol suitable for organisations with defined monitoring responsibilities and analytical capacity.
- Emphasizes data verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and standardized outputs (e.g., plots, maps, charts) with datasets stored on appropriate portals.

## Survey framework and permissions
- Begin with an outline plan to survey designated woods efficiently, minimizing travel and respecting access constraints.
- Obtain permission to survey each site; follow up with landowners or occupants as needed and maintain good public relations.
- If permission cannot be obtained, use backup sites provided by Merlewood.
- Communicate survey purpose clearly to owners; reassure that surveys aim at conservation, not purchase or compulsory measures.
- Plan access points to minimize walking distance and avoid disturbing the surrounding area.

## Site selection, access, and point location
- Sites are identified from maps (Ordnance Survey and site maps); aim for accurate but unbiased placement of sampling points.
- Sampling points are marked on a 22" site map with 16 points per site; precise ground location aims for about 20 m accuracy.
- Location method:
  - Choose the next point, locate a nearby ground control point (intersection, wall, fence change, etc.).
  - Orient the map with compass, measure bearing to the sample point, and pace out distance with slope corrections as needed.
  - Use predetermined paces and fixed directions; avoid subjective adjustments to maintain objectivity.

## Plot layout and organisation
- Each site contains nested sampling plots:
  - 2 x 2 m (4 m2) plot
  - 5 x 5 m (25 m2) plot
  - 10 x 10 m (100 m2) plot
  - 14.14 x 14.14 m (about 200 m2) full site plot
- Center point and right-angle orientation established with a center post and corner posts; color markers indicate sub-areas.
- For each plot, record flora and habitat data in a defined sequence to minimize disturbance.

## Data collection protocol by plot

### (a) Ground flora
- Survey presence/absence of plants in nested quadrats (2 x 2 m, 5 x 5 m, 10 x 10 m, and entire 14.14 m plot).
- Record percent cover or abundance for each species in the largest quadrat.
- Collect comprehensive bryophyte data for the full plot but do not enumerate bryophytes by each quadrat size.
- Collect specimens for herbarium with proper labeling; use standard herbarium procedures (Appendix I).

### (b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs
- Trees: measure diameter at breast height (DBH) for stems > 5 cm; record species and DBH by quadrant; note dead stems with a "D" designation.
- Saplings and shrubs: record only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); measure DBH or height as appropriate; follow same conventions for dead or multi-stemmed individuals.
- Height: measure the tallest tree within the plot using the provided height instrument.
- An example form is provided (Appendix III).

### (c) Plot description and habitats
- Record habitat attributes present within the plot using defined codes and Appendix IV definitions.
- Include slope and aspect measurements; create a ground-profile sketch illustrating major features.
- Complete the plot description with a narrative interpretation of topography, habitat types, and key features.

### (d) Soil data
- Collect soil data from a central pit and auger borings (top 10–15 cm; probe to ~70 cm depth where possible).
- Create a composite topsoil sample (10–15 cm) for laboratory analyses.
- Record soil descriptions using horizon-based interpretation (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) and a standardized set of attributes (Appendix IV and soil methodology).
- Perform a limited set of analyses in the field or basic analyses (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis) to enable later numerical description of soils.
- If sampling challenges occur (limited depth, rocky terrain), document and note possible data gaps.

## Site description and site-level data
- Complete a Site Description and Habitats form for each site, plus a Plot Description and Habitats form for each site (16 plots per site).
- Ensure consistency between site and plot forms; all required attributes must be recorded and checked for logical consistency.
- In some cases, additional boundary or marginal land-use information is collected by walking the boundary and using the map for reference.

## Herbarium and specimen handling
- Each team leader must prepare a comprehensive herbarium collection with a type specimen for all species observed in quadrats.
- Label specimens clearly with the species name (or code) and attach to herbarium sheets; retain flowering material if possible.
- Maintain consistency in identification to avoid misclassification; collect duplicates of uncertain species for later verification.

## Soil interpretation and major woodland soil types
- Focus on a limited set of soil properties due to scale (1648 plots): pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay composition).
- Use horizon-based interpretation to classify podzolic soils and calcareous soils, with recognition of transitional and mosaic patterns.
- Podzolic soils are leached and acidic, often with an A0/MULL or MOR humus profile; calcareous soils are base-rich and may be associated with chalk/limestone geology.
- Understand that field soils are often immature or transitional, with pedogenic processes continuing.

## Data handling, storage, and submission
- Forms are filled, stapled, and packaged in polythene bags; samples placed into appropriate boxes with weight limits for postal shipment.
- Pre-paid, pre-addressed labels are used for parcel shipment; samples are organized to minimize handling and ensure traceability.
- Data and specimens are intended for long-term storage and accessibility through standard portals and file systems.

## Field equipment and logistics
- Provides a complete list of field equipment required for site marking, plotting, soil sampling, and specimen collection.
- Includes two haversacks, compasses, tapes, meters, novelties for plot layout, and general field supplies.

## Endnotes and references
- Appendices provide detailed instructions for herbarium collection (Appendix I), examples of completed forms (Appendix II and III), and comprehensive definitions for Site and Plot Description forms (Appendix IV).
- Emphasizes the importance of comprehensive, accurate, and consistent data for long-term environmental monitoring and analysis.
