# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- This document provides a comprehensive field manual for surveying woodlands to classify habitats and collect standardized data across multiple plots per site. It covers planning, permissions, sampling point location, data recording, soil analysis, and data packaging into formal site and plot descriptions.

## Purpose, scope and outputs

- Define a repeatable methodology to survey woods, record habitat features, flora, trees, soils, and site descriptions.
- Produce structured data via site and plot description forms, with standardized codes and hierarchical data (site, plots, sub-attributes).
- Deliver physical data and samples (soil, bryophytes, herbarium specimens) in organized packaging for later analysis.

## Access, permissions and public relations

- Obtain site access permissions; guidance on approaching owners and occupants with tact and clear explanation.
- Maintain good public relations to avoid reputational impact on the Conservancy; communicate that surveys are not purchases but conservation data collection.
- If permission is refused, use backup sites from Merlewood and keep records of contact attempts.

## Survey planning and site selection

- Prepare an outline of operations to minimize travel, balance base location, and coordinate with regional staff.
- Use base sites to survey multiple woods when efficient; plan around access windows and dates.
- Ensure full equipment set is available and checked before departure (maps, forms, sampling gear).

## Locating sampling points (ground rules)

- Sites are marked on 22" site maps with 16 sampling points (1–16); accurate ground locating is critical.
- Two key aims: high accuracy and minimal subjective bias in locating points.
- A practical, predetermined method is used to locate each point within about 20 m of the true position:
  - Choose next point to sample.
  - Find a ground control point near the target (intersection, wall, stream, or fence change).
  - Orient map and compass; bearing to the sample point; compensate for magnetic variation.
  - Use map scale to pace out the distance; locate the control point on the ground.
  - Take compass bearing to the sample point and pace out the distance with slope corrections if needed.
  - Strictly follow predetermined pace counts; avoid altering directions to bypass obstacles.

## Order of recording data

- For each sample point, collect four data sets and two sample series:
  - Ground flora: presence/absence in five progressively larger quadrats (2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m) with percent cover estimates; comprehensive bryophyte collection from the full plot.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: measurements by quarter for trees >5 cm DBH, saplings (<5 cm DBH), and shrubs; height for the tallest tree.
  - Plot description and habitat attributes: presence/absence of habitat features with detailed attribute definitions (Appendix IV).
  - Soil data: small pit and auger borings at plot center; composite top 10–15 cm sample; soil descriptions per horizon (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2) following a standardized horizon interpretation scheme.
- Data can be collected in any order, but ground flora should be recorded first to minimize disturbance.

## Ground flora, sampling layout and specimens

- Use a center point and four corner poles to delineate successive 2x2 m, 4x4 m, 6x6 m, up to 14x14 m plots.
- Search each quadrat for all ground flora species; record presence and % cover, including bryophytes via separate herbarium collection (bryophytes are collected comprehensively but not as a separate bryophyte count within the quadrats).
- Collect unidentified specimens in labeled bags for later identification; specimens labeled with field codes should be preserved for herbarium submission (Appendix I).

## Trees, saplings and shrubs

- Trees: record species and diameter at breast height (DBH) for all stems >5 cm within the entire 14.14 m plot; treat multi-stemmed individuals as separate stems; note dead stems with “D.”
- Saplings: record for diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) with same measurements as trees.
- Shrubs: recorded similarly to saplings but restricted to diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3).
- Height: measure the tallest tree within the plot using the provided height instrument.

## Plot descriptor and habitats

- Record presence/absence of defined plot attributes (e.g., slope, aspect, glades, streams, rocks) using a standardized attribute coding system (Appendix IV).
- Include a ground-profile sketch and a short written description of major features and topography on the form.
- For soil description, use the horizon-based interpretation to categorize A horizons (Ao, Al, A2), B horizons (B1, B2), underlying material, and horizon-specific attributes (color, texture, structure, moisture).

## Soil data collection and interpretation

- due to scale, perform a limited, standardized soil analysis set for 1648 plots:
  - pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) from sub-samples.
  - Retain sub-samples for potential future analyses.
- Profile interpretation divides into horizons Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, and underlying material; record depth to horizon boundaries using the from-to depth convention.
- Horizon-specific attributes cover organic matter content, mineral material, moisture, color, structure, and texture; record presence/absence of horizons and transitional features (e.g., gleying, deposition layers).

## Site Description and Habitats forms

- Complete one Site Description and Habitats form per site; complete a Plot Description and Habitats form for each 16 plots per site.
- Forms use sequential code numbers; ensure consistency between site and plot forms and cross-check for logical consistency (e.g., presence of a site attribute should be reflected on the site form).
- If any significant site area is missed, perform a quick check trip to confirm no attributes were overlooked.

## Completion, data handling and packaging

- After data collection, check forms for completeness, verify plot and site numbers, and ensure all samples and equipment are accounted for.
- Pack soil and bryophyte samples into three boxes and herbarium specimens into a separate box to be mailed; ensure parcels are within weight limits and properly labeled and sealed.
- Four boxes per site, with postage-ready labels provided; ship as soon as convenient.

## Herbarium collection and processing

- Obtain a type specimen for all species in quadrats; ensure flowering shoots when possible.
- Record species names, codes, and collect specimens only if uncertain identifications arise; prepare herbarium sheets with proper labeling and preservation materials.
- Submit a comprehensive herbarium collection for quality assurance of species records.

## Appendices and equipment

- Appendix I–VI: instructions for herbarium specimens, completed form examples, plot/site data collection, soil data collection, and equipment checklists.
- Field equipment list and back-up supplies detailed to support data integrity and field operations.

## Soil types and major woodland soils (interpretive section)

- Podzolic soils: generally freely drained, acidic; leaching dynamics and climate influence on leaching; transition to hydromorphic or skeletal soils where drainage is impeded.
- Brown earths and brown forest soils: mixtures of organic and mineral horizons with varying humus content.
- Calcareous soils: contain free calcium carbonate; related to chalk/limestone geology; may grade into podzolic types; soil profile depth and parent material influence horizons.
- These soil types are interpreted from horizon descriptions to support broader ecological classification and data analysis.

- This section emphasizes that soils in Britain are dynamic and often immature or transitional, requiring careful horizon interpretation and horizon-bound data collection for consistent data analysis.

Note: This summary emphasizes data collection workflows, forms, attributes, and data management practices intended for a Data Support perspective, highlighting how data are captured, formatted, validated, and packaged for analysis and long-term use.
