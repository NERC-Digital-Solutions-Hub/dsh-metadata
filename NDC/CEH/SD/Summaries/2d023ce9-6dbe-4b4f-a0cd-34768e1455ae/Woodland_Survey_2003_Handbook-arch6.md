# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

- Aims to standardise field survey methods for the National Woodland Survey 2002, adapting from the 1971 baseline to generate robust woodland indicators.
- Focuses on collecting, validating, and structuring data to support analysis, interpretation, and data products for end users.

## Data collection framework

- Per site: one Site Description and Habitat Form plus 16 vegetation plots (16 plots per site) and four data datasets per plot, plus one soil sample per plot.
- Per site: an additional Site Description sheet capturing overall site information.
- Sampling approach emphasizes minimizing bias and ensuring data comparability across sites and years.
- GPS is discouraged for plot relocation to avoid introducing bias relative to historical plot positions.
- Permissions and access: surveyors must obtain landowner permission; a letter of introduction aids negotiations; owners receive full results.

## Survey design and data scope

- 16 random sampling points per site, located on maps provided (1:50,000 and original 2½" map overlays).
- Plot layout: 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m2) with four inner 2 x 2 m quadrats to create five nested sampling areas.
- Ground flora recorded first to capture least-disturbed state; subsequent data collection follows in a managed order.
- The survey captures vegetation, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot descriptions/habitats, and soil characteristics.

## Data forms and fields

- Vegetation plot: Ground Flora
  - Five quadrats (2 x 2 m up to 14.14 x 14.14 m); presence/absence of species; estimated percent cover for largest plot; common bryophytes on soil recorded ( Appendix II guidance; bryophytes on logs/rocks not required).
  - Presence/absence tracked with Q codes; abundance estimates to nearest 5%; categories for low or sparse occurrences (+, 1).
- Trees, saplings and shrubs
  - Trees (>5 cm DBH) recorded by quarter of the plot; height determined with clinometer or hypsometer; dead trees marked; multi-stem trees counted separately but recorded together.
  - Saplings (>130 cm height but <5 cm DBH) and shrubs recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3).
  - Height measurements require consistent horizontal distance; calibration and method noted on forms.
- Plot description and habitats
  - Presence/absence data for site-wide attributes within the plot; part of a broader habitat-context dataset (Appendix IV provides definitions).
- Soil sampling
  - Composite sample from plot center; top 15 cm; label each bag with site and plot; double labeling recommended; store in cool conditions until return.
  - If sampling is problematic, note changes and sample from nearest possible point within 1 m.
- Completion of the Plot
  - Checks to ensure all forms completed, samples logged, equipment accounted for; final plot-wide site information also collected (site description and habitats).

## Site-level data and documentation

- Site Description and Habitats form
  - Per site: captures landscape context, habitat types, and site-wide attributes; helps interpret plot-level data and changes over time.
- Data alignment and quality
  - Cross-checks ensure consistency between site and plot forms (attributes present on plot form appear on site form); address any gaps with brief ground checks.
- Appendices provide detailed coding schemes and definitions to support consistent data interpretation and downstream analysis.

## Data quality, bias, and risk management

- Key challenges:
  - Accurate relocation of plots over decades; potential bias if plots are chosen non-representatively.
  - Patchy or incomplete data across formats or plots.
  - Communicating complex data attributes plainly; ensuring reproducibility.
- Mitigations:
  - Strict adherence to standardised methods and forms; avoidance of subjective plot relocation decisions; use of duplicated labeling and comprehensive field notes.
  - Comprehensive equipment lists and procedural guidelines to ensure consistency across survey teams.
  - Documentation of ground conditions and changes in land use where plots no longer exist or have shifted.

## Data handling, storage and logistics

- Field workflow:
  - Prepare site folders with four data sets per plot plus soil samples; photos and sketches encouraged.
  - After fieldwork, consolidate data, staple forms, and prepare for data entry.
- Soil samples:
  - 16 soil samples per site; shipped to CEH Merlewood within the week when possible; proper labeling and cool storage emphasized to preserve sample integrity.
- Equipment and forms:
  - Waterproof forms, pencils, and field equipment (compass, clinometer, DBH tapes, plotting equipment) to be used consistently.
- Appendices and data assets
  - Appendix II and III provide example data sheets for vegetation and tree data; Appendix IV contains full Site Description and Habitat instructions; Appendix V lists field equipment; Appendix VI provides soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH, LOI).

## Appendices: key data assets and protocols

- Appendix Ia/Ib: bryophyte lists (common in pilot woodland sites and Great Britain) guiding ground flora recording.
- Appendix II: Vegetation Plot data templates and example entries.
- Appendix III: Tree, sapling and shrub data templates (including height, DBH, and mortality status).
- Appendix IV: Site Description and Habitats and related plotting instructions; data codes and attributes.
- Appendix V: Field equipment list and per-site field logistics.
- Appendix VI: Soil analysis protocols (pH measurement, loss on ignition, moisture determinations).

## Practical implications for data products and support

- The data framework supports downstream data products (dashboards, self-serve analyses) by providing structured, codified, and reproducible site- and plot-level data.
- Emphasises metadata and traceability (site/plot IDs, recorder initials, dates, measurement methods) to support longitudinal analyses and comparability with past surveys.
- Encourages thorough data quality checks and clear documentation to maximise reuse and reduce data loss risk.
