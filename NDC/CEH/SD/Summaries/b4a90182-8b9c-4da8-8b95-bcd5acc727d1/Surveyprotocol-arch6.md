# Experimental Design

- Objective: Assess potential exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria from livestock, poultry, and the environment; also evaluate antibiotic use in humans and poultry.
- Study design: Cross-sectional, interviewer-administered survey conducted in multiple settings.
- Settings and exposure groups:
  - Rural Mirzapur, Tangail district: rural households and rural broiler farms.
  - Urban Dhaka city: urban food markets.
  - Exposure groups (high vs low poultry exposure):
    - Rural villages: low exposure — households without domestic poultry (n=20); high exposure — households with domestic poultry (n=20).
    - Rural poultry farms: low exposure — non-poultry farm workers (n=40); high exposure — poultry farm workers (n=40).
    - Urban markets: low exposure — fruit/vegetable sellers (n=40); high exposure — live poultry sellers/slaughterers (n=40).
- Sampling framework:
  - Rural households: 20 villages; within each village, one poultry-owning and one non-poultry-owning household (total n=40).
  - Rural farms: 40 broiler farms randomly selected; one farm worker per farm (n=40).
  - Urban markets: 40 markets selected; one livestock stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder per market (n=80 respondents across two groups).
- Informed consent and ethics:
  - Written informed consent with right to withdraw.
  - Ethical approvals: icddr,b (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).
- Data collection methods:
  - Interviewers: trained icddr,b staff; conducted in Bangla; responses recorded on paper.
  - Translation: responses translated to English before data entry.
  - Timing: Phase 1 (Feb–Apr 2017) and Phase 2 (Aug–Oct 2017).
- Data quality and management:
  - Data entry into Excel; random checks against original forms; frequency checks to identify/out-of-range values; corrections applied.
- Data structure and access:
  - Three CSV data files: ruralhouseholdsurvey.csv, poultryfarmsurvey.csv, urbanmarketsurvey.csv.
  - Blank cells denote missing data.
  - Supporting documentation: Ruralsurveydatastructure.rtf, Farmsurveydatastructure.rtf, Marketsurveydatastructure.rtf (list column headings).
- Notes on analysis potential:
  - Enables cross-sectional analyses of antibiotic resistance exposure in humans and poultry, and associations with antibiotic use patterns.
  - Data suitable for developing dashboards or self-serve data products; potential for further data products and sharing of early prototypes.
