# Experimental Design

## Study setting and population
- Cross-sectional, interviewer-administered survey conducted in rural Mirzapur and Tangail district (Bangladesh) and urban food markets in Dhaka.
- Aimed at assessing potential exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria from livestock, poultry, and the environment, and antibiotic use in humans and poultry.

## Study design and groups
- Participants categorized into high exposure and low exposure groups across three settings:
  - Rural villages: low exposure – households without domestic poultry (n=20); high exposure – households owning domestic poultry (n=20).
  - Rural poultry farms: low exposure – non-poultry farm workers (n=40); high exposure – poultry farm workers (n=40).
  - Urban markets: low exposure – fruit/vegetable sellers (n=40); high exposure – live poultry sellers/slaughterers (n=40).
- Additional structure:
  - Rural households: 20 villages; within each village, one poultry-owning and one non-poultry owning household (total n=40).
  - Poultry farms: 40 broiler farms; one farm worker per farm (n=40); a healthy adult from the same village (non-poultry worker) for the low exposure group (n=40).
  - Urban markets: 40 markets; one livestock stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder per market (n=80 total).

## Ethical considerations
- Written informed consent obtained with right to withdraw.
- Ethical approvals: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

## Data collection methods and timeline
- Phase 1: February–April 2017; Phase 2: August–October 2017.
- Conducted by icddr,b researchers in Bangla; responses recorded on paper, later translated to English for data entry.

## Quality control and data management
- Data entered into Excel; random checks against original sheets by an independent researcher.
- Frequency checks to identify and correct out-of-range or erroneous values.
- Data translation and entry followed by independent verification.
