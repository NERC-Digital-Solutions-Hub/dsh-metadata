# Experimental Design

- Objective: Assess potential sources of exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria (especially commensal GI bacteria) from livestock, poultry, and the environment; assess the use of antibiotics in humans and poultry.
- Settings:
  - Rural households and rural broiler farms in Mirzapur, Tangail district.
  - Urban food markets in Dhaka city, Bangladesh.
- Exposure groups and sampling framework:
  - Rural villages
    - Low exposure: Households without domestic poultry (n=20)
    - High exposure: Households owning domestic poultry (n=20)
  - Rural poultry farms
    - Low exposure: Non-poultry farm workers (n=40)
    - High exposure: Poultry farm workers (n=40)
  - Urban food markets
    - Low exposure: Fruit and vegetable sellers (n=40)
    - High exposure: Live poultry sellers and slaughterers (n=40)
  - Note: In rural villages, one poultry-owning and one non-poultry-owning household per village were selected; total of 40 broiler farms with one farm worker each; a healthy adult from the same village as each farm worker used for the low-exposure group.
- Ethics and consent:
  - Written informed consent with rights to withdraw at any stage.
  - Ethical approvals: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).
- Data collection design:
  - Interviewer-administered surveys conducted in Bangla; responses recorded on paper.
  - Data entry: translations to English and entry into Excel.
  - Phase 1: Feb–Apr 2017; Phase 2: Aug–Oct 2017.
- Data collection team and process:
  - Conducted by icddr,b researchers; data translated to English by bilingual staff.
  - Random checks against original data sheets; frequency checks to identify out-of-range values.
- Data structure and documentation:
  - Three dataset files:
    - ruralhouseholdsurvey.csv
    - poultryfarmsurvey.csv
    - urbanmarketsurvey.csv
  - Blank cells indicate missing data.
  - Supporting data-structure documentation:
    - Ruralsurveydatastructure.rtf
    - Farmsurveydatastructure.rtf
    - Marketsurveydatastructure.rtf
  - Each documentation file lists the column headings for its corresponding dataset.
- Notable methodological detail:
  - There was no expected sample-size effect and no formal sample-size calculation for this baseline survey.
