# Experimental Design

- Objective and scope
  - Cross-sectional, interviewer-administered survey to assess potential exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria from livestock, poultry, and the environment, focusing on commensal GI bacteria in humans and poultry.
  - Secondary aim to assess use of antibiotics in humans and poultry.

- Settings and population
  - Rural households and rural poultry farms (broiler farms) in Mirzapur, Tangail district, Bangladesh.
  - Urban food markets in Dhaka city.

- Sampling framework and groups
  - Rural households (three exposure levels): 
    - Low exposure: households in rural villages without domestic poultry (n=20).
    - High exposure: households in rural villages with domestic poultry (n=20).
  - Rural poultry farms (three exposure levels):
    - Low exposure: non-poultry farm workers (n=40).
    - High exposure: poultry farm workers (n=40).
  - Urban markets (three exposure levels):
    - Low exposure: fruit and vegetable sellers (n=40).
    - High exposure: live poultry sellers and slaughterers (n=40).
  - Within rural households, 20 villages were included with one poultry-owning and one non-poultry-owning household per village, totaling 40 rural households; 40 broiler farms were selected; 40 farm workers; and 40 healthy adults from the same villages for low exposure groups in rural settings.
  - Baseline design with no formal sample size calculation.

- Ethics and consent
  - Written informed consent obtained, with right to withdraw at any time.
  - Ethical approvals: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

- Data collection methods
  - Trained icddr,b researchers conducted interviews in Bangla using paper-based questionnaires.
  - Responses translated into English by bilingual researchers before data entry.
  - Data collection phases: Phase 1 (February–April 2017) and Phase 2 (August–October 2017).

- Data management and quality control
  - Data entry into Excel; English translations verified.
  - Random checks against original data collection sheets by independent researchers.
  - Frequency checks to identify and correct out-of-range or erroneous values.

- Data structure and documentation
  - Dataset comprises three CSV files:
    - ruralhouseholdsurvey.csv
    - poultryfarmsurvey.csv
    - urbanmarketsurvey.csv
  - Blank cells indicate missing data.
  - Supporting documentation files detailing data structures:
    - Ruralsurveydatastructure.rtf
    - Farmsurveydatastructure.rtf
    - Marketsurveydatastructure.rtf
  - These provide column headings for each data file.

- Considerations for data strategy and reuse
  - End-to-end data lifecycle: clear sampling design, multi-setting data collection, translation and data entry workflow, and documented data structures.
  - Potential limitations to note for reuse: cross-sectional design limits causal inference; reliance on self-reported data; translation steps may introduce nuance changes; missing data indicated by blanks; absence of a published sample size calculation.
  - Data discoverability and metadata are supported by the three structured CSV files and accompanying data-structure documentation.
