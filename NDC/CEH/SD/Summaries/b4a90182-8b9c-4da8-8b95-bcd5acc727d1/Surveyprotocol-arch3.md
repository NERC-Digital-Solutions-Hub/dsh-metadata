# Experimental Design

- Objective
  - Assess potential exposure sources to antibiotic-resistant bacteria (focusing on commensal gastrointestinal bacteria) from livestock, poultry, and the environment.
  - Assess usage of antibiotics in humans and poultry.

- Setting and populations
  - Rural households and rural poultry farms (broiler farms) in Mirzapur, Tangail district.
  - Urban food markets in Dhaka city, Bangladesh.

- Sampling framework
  - Three settings with exposure-based groupings:
    - Rural villages (low exposure): households without domestic poultry (n=20)
    - Rural villages (high exposure): households owning domestic poultry (n=20)
    - Rural poultry farms (low exposure): non-poultry farm workers from the same villages (n=40)
    - Rural poultry farms (high exposure): poultry farm workers (n=40)
    - Urban food markets (low exposure): fruit and vegetable sellers (n=40)
    - Urban markets (high exposure): live poultry sellers and slaughterers (n=40)
  - Healthy adults from the same villages as farm workers used as low-exposure controls (n=40 for farms; additional low-exposure groups defined for other settings).
  - Design described as baseline survey with no expected size effect and no sample size calculation.

- Data collection methods
  - Interviewer-administered surveys conducted in Bangla; responses recorded on paper.
  - Translation of written responses to English prior to data entry.
  - Phase 1 data collection: February–April 2017; Phase 2: August–October 2017.
  - Data entry into Excel by trained staff; quality checks performed.

- Ethical considerations
  - Written informed consent obtained; participants could withdraw at any stage.
  - Ethical approvals: icddr,b (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

- Quality control and data management
  - Random checks comparing translations to original data collection sheets.
  - Frequency checks to identify out-of-range values and corrections applied.
  - Data files produced: three CSV datasets (ruralhouseholdsurvey.csv, poultryfarmsurvey.csv, urbanmarketsurvey.csv).
  - Blank cells indicate no data recorded.

- Data structure and documentation
  - Supporting documentation available: Ruralsurveydatastructure.rtf, Farmsurveydatastructure.rtf, Marketsurveydatastructure.rtf detailing column headings and data organization.
  - Data collection and structure designed to enable transparent data governance and facilitate future analyses and policy monitoring.

- Implications for environmental health monitoring
  - Provides baseline cross-sectional data on exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria across different exposure settings.
  - Demonstrates integration of data collection, translation/quality control, and documentation to support monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation.
  - Emphasizes the importance of ethical governance, data provenance, and clear data structure for reproducibility and data sharing considerations.
