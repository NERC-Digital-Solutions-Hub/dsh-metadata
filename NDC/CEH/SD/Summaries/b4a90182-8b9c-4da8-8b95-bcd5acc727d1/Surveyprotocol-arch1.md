# Experimental Design

## Objective
- Assess potential exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria (commensal GI bacteria) from livestock, poultry and the environment.
- Assess antibiotic use in humans and poultry.
- Use a cross-sectional, interviewer-administered survey to inform understanding of exposure pathways and potential interventions.

## Setting and populations
- Rural Mirzapur, Tangail district: rural households and rural poultry farms (broiler farms).
- Urban Dhaka city: urban food markets.

## Sampling framework
- Six groups with high/low exposure design:
  - Rural villages: low exposure households (n=20) and high exposure households (n=20) based on domestic poultry ownership.
  - Rural poultry farms: low exposure (non-poultry farm workers, n=40) and high exposure (poultry farm workers, n=40).
  - Urban markets: low exposure fruit and vegetable sellers (n=40) and high exposure live poultry sellers/slaughterers (n=40).
- Rural households: 20 villages; within each village, one poultry-owning household (n=20) and one non-poultry owning household (n=20) selected.
- Rural farms: 40 broiler farms from district livestock office list; one farm worker per farm (n=40); a healthy adult from the same village (non-poultry industry) for low exposure (n=40).
- Urban markets: 40 markets randomly selected; one livestock stall holder (n=40) and one fruit/vegetable stall holder (n=40).

## Data collection methods
- Interviewer-administered surveys conducted in Bangla; responses recorded on paper.
- Translations to English by bilingual researchers before data entry.
- Phase 1 data collection: February–April 2017; Phase 2: August–October 2017.

## Ethical considerations
- Written informed consent with right to withdraw.
- Ethical approvals: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

## Quality control
- Data translated to English and entered into Excel by trained staff.
- Random checks against original data by an independent researcher.
- Frequency checks to identify and correct out-of-range or erroneous values.

## Data structure and availability
- Data files: ruralhouseholdsurvey.csv; poultryfarmsurvey.csv; urbanmarketsurvey.csv.
- Blank cells indicate no data recorded.
- Supporting documentation: Ruralsurveydatastructure.rtf; Farmsurveydatastructure.rtf; Marketsurveydatastructure.rtf (list of column headings for each file).

## Limitations and notes for analysts
- Baseline survey with no predefined effect size and no sample size calculation.
- Cross-sectional design; potential recall bias and interviewer effects.
- Data entry and translation may affect consistency; relies on multiple datasets for unifying exposure contexts.
