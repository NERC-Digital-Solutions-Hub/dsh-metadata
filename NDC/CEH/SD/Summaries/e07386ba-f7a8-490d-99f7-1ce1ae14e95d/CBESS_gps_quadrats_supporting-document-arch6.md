# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) global positioning system (GPS) locations of quadrats in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

- Overview
  - GPS locations and elevations for CBESS wave monitoring and sedimentation/erosion instruments (CBESS_wave_monitoring, CBESS_sedimentation_erosion)
  - Staff: Tom Spencer, Ben Evans
- Locations and sites
  - Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM)
  - Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP)
  - Each site comprises a salt marsh area and an adjacent mudflat
  - Saltmarsh habitats represent contrasting soil types: clay soils (Essex) and sandy soils (Morecambe Bay)
  - Mudflats: Essex with cohesive clays/mud/silt; Morecambe Bay with coarse, mobile sediments
- Sampling design
  - For each site: 22 quadrats on the unvegetated mudflat and 22 quadrats on the salt marsh
  - Quadrats are 1 m square, located at the south-east corner
  - Quadrats oriented North-South and East-West
- Data collected and variables
  - Primary coordinates and elevation: Northing, Easting, Elevation relative to Ordnance Datum Newlyn
  - Seasonal context: Winter (W) and Summer (S) 2013
  - Scale fields indicating quadrat sub-sections (A, B, C, D) for location granularity
- Data collection methods and formats
  - GPS: Leica GS08 GNSS with real-time Leica RTK corrections
  - Observations recorded within two weeks prior to or during CBESS main campaigns (Winter and Summer 2013)
  - Data exported as ASCII text; unnecessary/duplicate points removed in MS Excel; no further processing reported
- Data quality and notes
  - Quality check: 50 mm positional accuracy threshold; points above this rejected
  - NA values indicate measurements not performed
  - Dataset fields described via headers (Description, Row number), with core fields for site, habitat, quadrat, scale, Easting, Northing, Elevation, and Season
- Dataset structure and interoperability
  - OSGB1936(2) coordinate system used
  - South-east corner of 1 m quadrats as spatial reference; suitable for GIS integration and cross-dataset linking within CBESS
  - Raw, unprocessed data intended to support spatial mapping and downstream analyses of coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services
