# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) GPS locations of quadrats in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

## Purpose and scope
- Provides GPS locations and elevations for CBESS wave monitoring, surface elevation, and sedimentation installations.
- Aims to support environmental health monitoring by enabling spatial referencing of key monitoring equipment within saltmarsh and mudflat habitats.

## Study design and sites
- Six UK sites: three in Essex (saltmarsh and adjacent mudflat) and three in Morecambe Bay (saltmarsh and adjacent mudflat).
- Site selection contrasts sediment types: Essex sites with clay soils; Morecambe Bay sites with sandy soils.
- Essex vs Morecambe Bay saltmarsh regions differ in inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
- At each site, 22 quadrats on unvegetated mudflat and 22 quadrats on salt marsh were surveyed.

## Habitat and quadrat details
- Habitats: Saltmarsh and Mudflat per site.
- Quadrats: 1 m square; 22 per habitat per site (total 44 per site; 6 sites = 264 quadrats).
- Locations recorded at the south-east corner of each quadrat, oriented North-South and East-West.

## Location data and coordinate systems
- Observations include Northing, Easting, and Elevation relative to Ordnance Datum Newlyn.
- Coordinate system: OSGB1936(2) with a Leica GS08 GNSS system used for data collection.
- Quality control: 3D coordinate quality check with a threshold of 50 mm (points above this were rejected).

## Data collection timing and procedure
- Sampling occurred within two weeks prior to or during CBESS main campaigns in Winter and Summer 2013.
- No data processing beyond initial collection; data were exported as ASCII text and minimally cleaned.

## Variables and data fields
- Core fields: Season (Winter or Summer), Site (Essex or Morecambe), Habitat (Mudflat or Saltmarsh), Quadrat number (1–22), Scale (A–D for spatial referencing), Easting, Northing, Elevation.
- Dataset description and field descriptions are included to support interpretation and reuse.
- NA values indicate measurements not performed.

## Data provenance and responsible personnel
- Staff responsible: Tom Spencer and Ben Evans.
- Data describe GPS locations for survey quadrats across six CBESS sites, documenting raw spatial coordinates and associated metadata.

## Data quality, governance and accessibility
- Data are raw spatial references with minimal processing, accompanied by metadata and field descriptions to assist verification and reuse.
- Explicit notes about data format (ASCII text) and minimal transformation highlight transparency and potential data governance considerations for sharing and updating metadata.
