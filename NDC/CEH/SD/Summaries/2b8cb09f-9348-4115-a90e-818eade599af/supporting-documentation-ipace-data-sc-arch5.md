# Supporting documentation IPACE data

## Aim and scope
- Presents a structured protocol for collecting qualitative climate and agricultural decision-making data to support early warning, action, and farmer engagement in weather services.
- Focuses on monthly agricultural activities, climate factors, and extreme weather events and how these influence farming decisions.
- Uses FGDs in areas with weather stations to capture spatial resolution and heterogeneity in agro-climatic indices and to enable intra- and inter-district comparisons.

## Study design and setting
- Focus Group Discussions conducted in selected Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) within Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts.
- EPAs chosen for ongoing PICSA and MRCS projects and for having long-term weather records; designed to explore intra- and inter-district variability.
- 15 FGDs conducted between April and May 2019 across 5 EPAs: 10 with farmers and 5 with Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs).
- Participants: 70 female farmers, 48 male farmers, and 21 AEDOs. Age ranges: 28–58 (men) and 20–54 (women).
- Local language: Chichewa; discussions audio-recorded, translated, and transcribed by a local research assistant.
- Data collection protocol is outlined in Appendix 1, including detailed field and interview records.

## Data collection methods and governance
- Qualitative data collection centered on drawing seasonal calendars and capturing climate-related farm decisions.
- Quality control includes cross-checks by researchers and local assistants; data structure follows a predefined protocol to ensure consistency.
- Data are organized and stored according to a standardized collection protocol (Appendix 1), including specifics for calendars and climate events.
- Emphasis on documenting methods and maintaining a clear audit trail for data provenance and reproducibility.
- Transcription and translation processes are integral to preserving meaning from local language discussions.

## Data elements and metadata
- Nature and units of recorded values: Qualitative data and seasonal calendars.
- Interview and participant information: Enumerator name, date, times, interview code; participant names and location; GPS coordinates; household farming area and crops grown; yields and usage (domestic, trading, fodder, etc.).
- Background information: Household farming practices, land area, crops, and production context.
- Crop/farm calendar: Monthly agricultural practices, land preparation, planting, weeding, fertilization, drying, storage, pests, weeds, soil moisture, rainfall presence/quantity, temperature, wind, hail, and other climate indicators.
- Non-climatic conditions: Crop insurance, seed accessibility, labor, fertilizers.
- Temporal scope: Monthly planning and decision timelines (July through June) with attention to time required to implement decisions and weather-condition impacts for each month.
- Climate risks: Identification and ranking of key climate-related risks (top 3 per month).
- Data capture specifics: Questions designed to elicit detailed field observations, climate risk perception, and expected field outcomes under varying weather conditions.
- Use of weather/climate information: Differentiates users and non-users, sources of information, formats, frequency, perceived usefulness, trust, and desired improvements.
- Appendix 1 structures the data collection fields and ensures consistent capture across interviews.

## Analytical methods
- Qualitative data coded and organized by maize-growing season month to derive structured insights.
- Extraction of farmer responses on specific climatic phenomena and their impact on crop management timing to establish cause-effect relationships.
- Systematic analysis includes recall of extreme seasons/years and evaluation of information use, sources, timing, and potential improvements.
- Integration of local knowledge signs for predicting dry/wet seasons and evaluation of adaptive strategies (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching).

## Appendix 1 protocol highlights (focus areas)
- Interview Information: enumerator details, timing, and interview identifiers.
- Participants' Information: geographic and demographic context, village-level details, and GPS data.
- Background Information: farm size, crops grown, and recent production metrics.
- Crop/Farm Calendar: detailed sections on agricultural practices, climate risks, and field conditions across months.
- Data capture fields: rainfall presence and amounts, dry spells, temperatures, winds, pests, and crop health indicators.
- Other factors: non-climatic influences on agricultural decisions, such as input access and labor.
- Processing and organization: explicit prompts for recording monthly decisions, expected field conditions, and the impact of weather on agricultural choices.
- Use and improvement of weather information: detailed questions on usage, sources, formats, timing, and desired changes to information delivery.
- Recalling extremes: structured discussion prompts to identify the most impactful climate events, information usefulness, sources, timing, trust, and adaptation options.
- Local knowledge and strategies: prompts to capture indigenous indicators and practical responses to anticipated dry spells or extreme events.

## Data governance and stewardship considerations
- The document provides a comprehensive, standardized data collection framework to ensure data quality, consistency, and comparability across sites and time.
- It supports discoverability and reusability by detailing metadata elements (location, participants, timing, and data structure) and by outlining explicit analytical methods.
- The protocol anticipates challenges common to data stewardship, such as harmonizing data across multiple systems and formats and addressing timely data collection through structured FGDs.
- The inclusion of GPS coordinates, language processing (translation/transcription), and detailed field conditions supports robust metadata and potential interoperability for future sharing and meta-analyses.
