# Supporting documentation IPACE data

## Overview
- Focus on qualitative data collection to understand how farmers engage with climate services and weather information within extension and farming communities.
- Conducted in Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts of Malawi, in EPAs with PICSA and MRCS projects and at least one weather station.
- Aimed to explore spatial resolution and heterogeneity of agro-climatic indices and to relate climate factors to agricultural decision-making through seasonal calendars.

## Study design and scope
- Method: Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with farmers and Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs).
- Settings: Five Extension Planning Areas (EPAs); opportunities for intra- and inter-district comparisons.
- Participants: 15 FGDs (10 with farmers, 5 with AEDOs); total participants: 70 female farmers, 48 male farmers, 21 AEDOs.
- Language and process: Discussions conducted in Chichewa, audio-recorded, translated, and transcribed by a local research assistant.
- Timeline: FGDs conducted April–May 2019.
- Data collection focus: Qualitative data on monthly agricultural activities, climate services, and responses to extreme weather events; inclusion of seasonal calendars as discussion guides.

## Data collection instruments and elements
- Mandatory element: Collection/generation methods through FGDs.
- Data structure and content (as per Appendix 1):
  - Interview information: enumerator, date, times, interview code.
  - Participants’ information: names, location (province, district, village), GPS coordinates.
  - Background information: household area cultivated (past 12 months), crops grown, yield, and other production characteristics.
  - Crop/farm calendar: agricultural practices, field/crop descriptions under good weather, key climate risks, rainfall and moisture indicators, non-climatic constraints (seeds, labour, inputs), and monthly decision prompts (July–June).
  - Time and effort: preparation time for decisions, weather condition impacts by month, and other questions on how weather affects farming practices.
  - Climate risk assessment: identification and prioritization of top climate-related risks (top 3).
  - Data on expectations of good weather conditions and observed signs of favorable or unfavorable seasons.
- 2.1 Recalling/extreme seasons: sheets to discuss the most critical weather risks/events by month, information use, sources, decision impact, and adaptation strategies.

## Constructing a Crop/Farm Calendar
- Detailed monthly framework (July through June) for:
  - Agricultural practices: land prep, planting, weeding, fertilization, drying, storage.
  - Climate risks: rains, dry spells, temperature, winds, hail, soil moisture; top climate-related risks.
  - Field/crop indicators: signs of good/bad weather on crops; non-climatic conditions affecting practices (insurance, seed access, labor, inputs).
  - Information collection: questions to capture expected practices under each month and how long preparations take.
  - How weather influences practice decisions and expected field/crop outcomes under good versus extreme conditions.
  - Local knowledge and adaptation strategies: signs to anticipate season dryness/wetness and available coping techniques.

## Use of weather/climate information by farmers
- Classification of participants into:
  - Those who receive weather/climate information.
  - Those who do not receive such information.
- For receivers: what information is used, sources, receipt methods, formats, usefulness, trust, frequency, and conditions needed to act on it.
- For non-receivers: what information would be useful, preferred receipt mechanisms, formats, and frequency, plus potential channels to improve access (e.g., extension officers, radio, etc).
- Questions cover: usefulness for decision-making, trust, desired improvements, and whether information should be provided at different times of the year.

## Data processing and quality control
- Quality control through cross-checking by researchers and a local research assistant.
- Data is structured and stored according to the Appendix 1 protocol, enabling systematic coding and later analysis.
- Qualitative data coded to extract month-by-month climate–decision relationships and to identify cause–effect links between climate events and farm management decisions.

## End-to-end data governance and implications for data leaders
- Data scope supports understanding of climate services use and farm decision-making in targeted regions with existing weather infrastructure.
- Metadata and traceability elements included: GPS coordinates, interview details, participant backgrounds, and structured monthly calendars.
- Data is the basis for deriving agro-climatic indices and informs potential improvements in weather information delivery, extension services, and community data coordination.
- Points to consider for data leaders: standardizing metadata, ensuring discoverability across EPAs, addressing potential data gaps due to sampling via AEDOs, and integrating qualitative insights with quantitative climate datasets for actionable outputs.
