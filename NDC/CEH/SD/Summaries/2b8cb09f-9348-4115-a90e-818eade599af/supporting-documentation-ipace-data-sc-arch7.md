# Supporting documentation IPACE data Mandatory elements

- Geographic and sampling context
  - Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) conducted in Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) within Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts.
  - EPAs selected where PICSA and MRCS projects on early warning/early action and farmer engagement in weather services delivery exist, with at least one long-term weather station.
  - Design aimed to assess spatial resolution and heterogeneity (intra- and inter-district) of agro-climatic indices.
  - Spatial scope supports comparison across months and areas and informs GIS-based spatial analyses.

- Study design and participants
  - 15 FGDs conducted between April and May 2019 across five EPAs.
  - Participants: 10 FGDs with farmers, 5 FGDs with Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs).
  - Participant composition: 70 female farmers, 48 male farmers, 21 AEDOs; includes lead farmers; mixed gender representation.
  - Language: discussions conducted in Chichewa; audio-recorded, translated, and transcribed by a local assistant.
  - Selection criteria: farmers chosen by AEDOs; includes diverse household scales and crops.

- Data collection framework and data structure
  - Appendix 1: Protocol for data collection outlining field procedures and data capture fields.
  - Recorded information (interview metadata):
    - Enumerator name, date, start/end times, interview code.
  - Participants’ information:
    - Province, district/municipality, village, participant names; GPS coordinates.
  - Background data (structural/household agriculture):
    - Estimated area cultivated (past 12 months), crops grown (ranked by area), yield, and use/quality.
  - Crop/Farm Calendar and agricultural practices:
    - Field/crop status under good weather, key climate risks, land preparation, planting, weeding, fertiliser, drying, storage.
    - Climate/risk indicators: rain presence/quantity, dry spells, temperatures, winds, hail, soil moisture; high-level timing across months.
    - Non-climatic conditions: seed accessibility, input availability, labour, crop insurance.
    - Monthly agricultural decisions and time required for preparations; how weather conditions influence decisions.
  - Climate risk and decision context:
    - Key climate-related risks; top three; how risks affect practices and decision timing.
  - Weather/climate information use (Section 3):
    - Whether information is received; sources, how received (mechanism and format), frequency, usefulness, trust, and preferred improvements.
    - For non-recipients: what information would be useful and how they would like to receive it.
    - Questions on critical timing and conditions required to use information (access, comprehension, timely delivery).
  - Attitudinal and behavioral questions:
    - Trust, usefulness, data accessibility, desired formats, preferred channels (extension, radio, etc.), and times of year when information is most helpful.
  - Extended data collection (Sheet 2):
    - Recalling and describing recent extreme seasons/years by month (July through June).
    - Probing: most critical weather risks/events, information used, sources/format/timing, impact on decisions, potential improvements, local signs of seasonality, and adaptation strategies (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching).

- Data elements and structure
  - Qualitative and semi-structured data linked to month-by-month agro-climatic indices.
  - Spatial anchors include EPAs, districts, and GPS coordinates for participants.
  - Data organized around:
    - Interview metadata
    - Participant and household background
    - Crop/farm calendars and agricultural practices
    - Climate risk factors and rainfall/soil moisture indicators
    - Perceived usefulness, access, and delivery channels for weather/climate information
    - Extremes, coping strategies, and adaptation practices
  - Analytical approach:
    - Coding and organizing climate and farm-decision information by maize growing season month.
    - Extracting statements about specific climatic events and their impact to derive cause–effect insights.

- Analytical methods and outputs
  - Qualitative data coded to reveal temporal patterns and decision points tied to agro-climatic signals.
  - Construction of monthly agro-climatic calendars and risk profiles per EPA/district.
  - Synthesis of farmer and AEDO perspectives on information usefulness, delivery formats, and trust.
  - Outputs suitable for GIS integration:
    - Geolocated FGD points (EPAs, villages) with associated qualitative attributes.
    - Spatially explicit indicators of perceived climate risks, information access, and adaptation practices.
    - Temporal (monthly) agro-climatic calendars linked to locations for mapping variability.

- Weather information use and access
  - Participants categorized by receipt of weather/climate information.
  - For recipients: what information, format, source, frequency, trust, and how it informs decisions.
  - For non-recipients: what information would be useful and preferred delivery mechanisms.
  - Frequency and timing preferences for receiving information and conditions required to act on it.

- Recalling extremes and adaptation
  - Sheet 2 prompts discuss the most critical weather risks/events, reception and utility of information, sources, timing, and how information influenced decisions.
  - Local knowledge and season-sign indicators documented.
  - Adaptation strategies discussed (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching, crop diversification) in response to expected dry/wet patterns.

- Data quality, standards, and limitations
  - Quality control includes cross-checks by researchers and local assistants; translation and transcription steps noted.
  - Data structure aligned with a predefined protocol (Appendix 1) to ensure consistency.
  - Limitations to consider for GIS use:
    - Qualitative nature and reliance on recall may affect precision.
    - Spatial coverage limited to five EPAs; may affect extrapolation to broader districts.
    - Potential language and translation nuances impacting data interpretation.

- Implications for GIS specialists
  - Rich, geolocated qualitative data that can be mapped alongside weather station observations to assess spatial heterogeneity in agro-climatic indices.
  - Monthly seasonal calendars enable temporal GIS analyses of climate risks and farming decisions.
  - Cross-dataset integration potential: combine FGDs with sensor/wx-station data, land-use maps, and farmer-reported practices to create spatial risk profiles and decision-support layers.
  - Data governance considerations: ensure coordinate accuracy, consistent EPA/district labeling, and clear documentation of qualitative codes for mapping.

- Appendix and protocol reference
  - Appendix 1 provides the comprehensive data collection protocol, including the fields to capture, interview and participant information, and the structure for the Crop/Farm Calendar and climate-risk sections.
  - The protocol supports systematic data capture for subsequent geospatial analysis and GIS-based reporting.
