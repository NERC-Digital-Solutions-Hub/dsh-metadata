# Supporting documentation IPACE data

- Purpose and scope
  - Document the data collection and protocol behind IPACE to understand agro-climatic indices and farmer decision-making.
  - Support early warning/early action, farmer engagement in weather services, and analysis of spatial heterogeneity across districts.
  - Emphasize standardized outputs (e.g., seasonal calendars, coded qualitative data) for consistent environmental health monitoring.

- Study setting and participants
  - Focused in selected Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) within Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts.
  - EPAs chosen where PICSA and MRCS projects operate and have long-term weather observations.
  - 15 focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted April–May 2019 across five EPAs: 10 with farmers and 5 with Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs).
  - Participants: 70 female and 48 male farmers; 21 AEDOs; discussions conducted in Chichewa and audio-recorded, then translated/transcribed.
  - Farmers selected by AEDOs, including lead farmers and varied age groups.

- Data collection methods
  - Primary method: focus group discussions guided by monthly agricultural calendars to link climate services to farming decisions.
  - Qualitative data collected and used to draw seasonal calendars; data and calendars structured per the protocol (Appendix 1).
  - Quality control: cross-checks by researchers and a local research assistant.

- Data types, structure, and quality assurance
  - Qualitative data plus seasonal calendars; records include interview details, participant information, and field observations.
  - Data organized and structured according to a predefined collection protocol (Appendix 1).
  - Seasonal calendars are a core data product, linked to the monthly maize growing season to explore climate–decision relationships.

- Analytical approach
  - Qualitative data coded and organized by month of the maize growing season.
  - Extract farmer responses on seasonal climatic phenomena affecting crops and crop management decisions.
  - Derive cause–effect relationships between climate events and farming decisions.

- Appendix 1 protocol highlights (protocol for FGDs with farmers)
  - Record-keeping: interviewer details, date/time, interview code, participant information (location, village, GPS, household size estimates, crops, yield, etc.).
  - Constructing a Crop/Farm Calendar: agricultural practices by month, field/crop descriptions under different weather, key climate risks, rain presence/amounts, rainfall timing, temperature, wind, hail, soil moisture, etc.
  - Other conditions: non-climatic factors like seed access, inputs, labor availability, crop insurance.
  - Monthly prompts: detailed questions about main practices/decisions for each month, time to implement decisions, weather impacts on practices, expected field signs in good weather, and key climate risks (top 3).
  - Use of weather/climate information (for farmers): who receives information, what information is used, sources, delivery modes, formats, frequency, usefulness, trust, and desired improvements.
  - For non-receivers: what information would be useful and preferred delivery formats.
  - Recalling and describing recent extreme seasons/years: sheets guiding discussions on the most critical weather risks, information usage, sources, usefulness for decisions, improvements, local knowledge signs, and adaptation strategies.

- Use of weather/climate information by farmers (detailed)
  - Split participants into:
    - Those who receive weather/climate information: what information, source, delivery, format, frequency, usefulness, trust, and improvements.
    - Those who do not receive weather/climate information: why, what information would be useful, and preferred delivery methods.
  - Questions cover usefulness for decision-making, needed conditions to act on information (access, comprehension, timing), and desired changes for utility.

- Recalling and describing recent extremes (Sheet 2 prompts)
  - Structured discussion by month (July–December) to identify:
    - Most critical weather risk/event affecting crops and specificity of impacts.
    - Whether weather information was used, what information it was, source, delivery, timing, and its impact on decisions.
    - Desired improvements to information (type, source, format, timing).
    - Local knowledge cues for seasonality (dry/wet signs) and adaptation strategies (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching).

- Data management and sharing implications
  - Emphasizes turning collected data into durable, reusable datasets (beyond single reports).
  - Highlights the importance of data quality, standardization, and accessibility of underlying data for wider use and scrutiny.
  - Encourages storage and uploading of datasets to appropriate portals to enable broader access.
