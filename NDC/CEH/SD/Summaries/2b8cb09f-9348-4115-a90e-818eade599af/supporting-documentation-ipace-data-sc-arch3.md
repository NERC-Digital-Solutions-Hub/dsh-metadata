# Supporting documentation IPACE data

## Overview
- Focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted in Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts' Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) with ongoing PICSA and MRCS projects on early warning, early action, and farmer engagement in weather services.
- Aimed at understanding agro-climatic indices, spatial resolution/heterogeneity, and how climatic information influences farmer decisions.
- Data collection emphasizes qualitative insights, monthly agricultural activities, and climate-related decision-making, with long-term weather station coverage for comparability.

## Objectives and Scope
- Identify useful indicators and measures for monitoring environmental health and informing policy decisions.
- Explore how climate services affect agricultural practices and decision-making at the farm level.
- Assess data availability, quality, and gaps, including metadata and data sharing considerations, to support monitoring frameworks.

## Methods: Data Collection and Sampling
- Method: Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) chosen to engage farmers and Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs) and to facilitate group interaction around a common topic.
- Sampling and settings:
  - 15 FGDs conducted between April and May 2019 across five EPAs.
  - Participants: 10 FGDs with farmers and 5 FGDs with AEDOs.
  - Total participants: 70 female farmers, 48 male farmers, and 21 AEDOs.
  - Participant selection: Farmers chosen by AEDOs; includes both male and female participants and at least one lead farmer.
  - Language and logistics: FGDs conducted in Chichewa; sessions audio-recorded, translated, and transcribed by a local research assistant.
- Data quality: Cross-checks by researchers and local assistant to ensure consistency.

## Data Collected and Structure
- Qualitative data focused on:
  - Monthly agricultural activities aligned with climate services.
  - How climatic factors influence crop management decisions and timing (with a focus on maize).
- Data structure adheres to a predefined protocol (Appendix 1), including:
  - Seasonal calendars to capture intra-district and inter-district variability.
  - Coding of climate and farm decision information by month of the maize growing season.
  - Extraction of farmer responses on specific climatic events and their impacts on crop management decisions.

## Appendix 1: Protocol for Data Collection
- Interview information:
  - Enumerator name, date, start/end times, interview code (District_Name_InterviewNo_DDMMYY).
- Participants information:
  - Names, province, district municipality, local municipality, village name, GPS coordinates.
- Background information:
  - Estimated average area cultivated, crops grown (top three by area), yields, and crop use.
- Constructing a Crop/Farm Calendar:
  - Agricultural practices (land preparation, planting, weeding, fertilization, drying, storage).
  - Key climate risks and indicators (rain presence/amounts, dry spells, temperatures, winds, hail, soil moisture).
  - Non-climatic conditions affecting practices (seed access, labor, fertilizers).
  - Monthly agricultural decisions and time required to implement them.
  - How decisions respond to weather conditions across months.
  - Expected field/crop conditions under good weather.
  - Key climate-related risks (top 3 for each month).
- Use of weather/climate information (Section 3):
  - Grouping: those who receive weather information vs. those who do not.
  - For recipients: information used, source, receipt method, format, frequency, perceived usefulness/trust, and potential improvements.
  - For non-recipients: perceived usefulness, potential information needs, preferred delivery mechanisms and formats, and conditions needed to use information effectively.
  - Questions cover usefulness for decision-making, trust, and changes to improve usefulness.
- Recalling and describing recent extreme season/year (Section 2.1):
  - For each month, participants discuss the most critical weather risks/events, information used (if any), sources and delivery, impact on decisions, and potential improvements.
  - Local knowledge signs for seasonality (dry/wet indicators) and coping strategies (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching).

## Key Data Elements and Analytical Focus
- Qualitative insights into:
  - How farmers perceive and interpret extreme weather events.
  - The role and usefulness of climate information in crop decisions.
  - Preferred formats and channels for climate information dissemination.
  - Barriers to data access, understanding, and timely receipt of information.
- Analytical approach:
  - Coding climate-related information by month to derive cause–effect relationships.
  - Linking climate risks to agricultural practices and decision timelines.
  - Assessing spatial heterogeneity by comparing intra-district and inter-district patterns.

## Data Quality, Metadata, and Governance Considerations
- Metadata captured through detailed interviewer and participant information (location, crops, GPS, etc.).
- Quality control includes cross-checks by researchers and local assistants.
- The protocol emphasizes standardization (Appendix 1) to support comparability across EPAs and districts.
- Implications for data governance and sharing:
  - Qualitative data with clear provenance and coding schemes facilitates data reuse.
  - Structured data collection supports transparency and potential integration with broader monitoring frameworks.
