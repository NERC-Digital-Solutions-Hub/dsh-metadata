# Supporting documentation IPACE data

## Purpose and scope
- Document describes a qualitative data collection effort to understand agro-climatic indices, weather services delivery, and farmer decision-making.
- Focuses on extension planning areas (EPAs) with PICSA and MRCS projects and at least one long-term weather station.
- Aims to assess spatial resolution and heterogeneity (intra- and inter-district) and to link climate information to agricultural actions.

## Study setting and design
- Geographic focus: Mangochi, Salima, and Zomba districts (Malawi) across five EPAs.
- Method: Focus group discussions (FGDs) guided by seasonal calendars to relate climate services to monthly agricultural activities and extreme weather events.
- Timing: April–May 2019.

## Participants and sampling
- Total FGDs: 15 (10 with farmers, 5 with Agricultural Extension Development Officers, AEDOs).
- Participants: 70 female farmers, 48 male farmers, 21 AEDOs.
- Selection: Farmers chosen by AEDOs; included both genders and lead farmer representatives.
- Language: FGDs conducted in Chichewa; sessions audio-recorded, translated, and transcribed by a local research assistant.
- Demographics: Age ranges provided (male farmers 28–58; female farmers 20–54).

## Data collection instruments and data elements
- Core data: Qualitative data structured around a crop/farm calendar and monthly agricultural practices.
- Record-keeping elements (as per Appendix 1):
  - Interview information (enumerator, date, start/end times, interview code)
  - Participants’ information (names, location, village; GPS coordinates)
  - Household context (mean/range of land cultivated; crops grown)
  - Production details (yield, quality, purposes)
  - Agricultural practices and calendar (field/crop activities, climate risks, non-climatic constraints)
  - Climate data integration (presence/absence and specifics of rainfall, temperature, moisture, etc.)
  - Perceived climate risks (top risks by month; top 3 selections)
  - Information usage and decision-making (sources, formats, frequency, usefulness, trust, and potential improvements)

## Data structure and analytical methods
- Data organized by the maize growing season month for analysis.
- Qualitative coding to extract: climate events, crop management decisions, timing, and cause–effect relationships.
- Appendix 1 provides a detailed protocol for data collection and variable capture.

## Constructing a Crop/Farm Calendar
- Captures monthly agricultural practices (land preparation, planting, weeding, fertilization, drying, storage) and corresponding climate risks.
- Documents non-climatic factors affecting practices (seed access, labor, inputs, insurance).
- Includes assessment of time required to implement decisions and expected field conditions under good weather.
- Records indicators of climate risk (e.g., rainfall amounts, dry spells, extreme events) and farmer responses.

## Use of weather/climate information by farmers (Section 3)
- Participants categorized as:
  - Receiving weather/climate information
  - Not receiving weather/climate information
- For receivers: what information is used, sources, how received, format, frequency, usefulness, trust, and conditions needed to act on it.
- For non-receivers: potential usefulness if information were accessible, preferred delivery methods, and formats.
- Key questions cover desired improvements (information type, source, timing, and accessibility) and how information informs decisions.

## Recalling and describing recent extreme seasons/years (Section 2.1)
- Participants discuss:
  - Most critical weather risks/events affecting crops with specificity.
  - Use and source of weather information; timing of receipt.
  - Impact on crop decisions and potential improvements to information.
  - Local knowledge indicators for season onset/dryness and coping strategies (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching).

## Quality control and data integrity
- Cross-checks by researchers and a local research assistant to ensure consistency across areas.
- Data is transcribed and translated to maintain fidelity to local language nuances.

## Outputs and potential uses
- Produces a rich, structured qualitative dataset linking agro-climatic perceptions to monthly farming decisions.
- Enables analysis of data gaps, information delivery needs, and the effectiveness of weather/climate information in supporting farming practices.
- Supports decision-makers in tailoring weather information services and agricultural extension to local contexts and seasonal timing.
