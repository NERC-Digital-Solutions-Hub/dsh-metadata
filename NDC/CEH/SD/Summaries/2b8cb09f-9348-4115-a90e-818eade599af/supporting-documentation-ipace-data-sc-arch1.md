# Supporting documentation IPACE data

- Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted in specific Extension Planning Areas (EPAs) within Mangochi, Salima and Zomba districts to understand early warning/early action and farmer engagement in weather services delivery. Selected EPAs have PICSA and MRCS projects and at least one long-term weather station, enabling analysis of spatial resolution and heterogeneity in agro-climatic indices.

- Study design and timing
  - 15 FGDs conducted between April and May 2019 across five EPAs: 10 with farmers and 5 with Agricultural Extension Development Officers (AEDOs).
  - Participants: 70 female farmers, 48 male farmers, and 21 AEDOs.
  - Participant selection: farmers chosen by AEDOs; included both genders, with at least one lead farmer represented.
  - Language: discussions conducted in Chichewa, audio recorded, translated and transcribed by a local research assistant.

- Data content and structure
  - Use of seasonal calendars during FGDs to explore important monthly agricultural activities and how climate factors influence decision-making.
  - Data collected qualitatively, structured according to a predefined protocol (Appendix 1), with emphasis on the maize growing season.
  - Core data elements include interview metadata, participant information, household agriculture details, crops grown, yields, and the spatial/temporal context of farming practices.
  - Construction of a Crop/Farm Calendar to capture agricultural practices, key climate risks, rainfall patterns, non-climatic constraints (e.g., seeds, labor, fertilizers), and monthly decision points (July through June).

- Analytical methods
  - Qualitative data are coded and organized by month of the maize growing season.
  - Extraction of farmer responses related to specific seasonal climatic phenomena and their impacts on crop management decisions to derive potential cause–effect relationships.

- Appendix 1: Protocol for FGDs with farmers
  - Interview information: enumerator name, date, start/end times, interview code; participant details including location and language; background information (area cultivated, crops grown, estimated area, yields, etc.).
  - Constructing a Crop/Farm Calendar: records on agricultural practices, field descriptions under good weather, presence/absence of rain, rainfall amounts and durations, soil moisture, pests and diseases, post-harvest aspects, and other non-climatic conditions affecting farming.
  - Monthly agricultural decisions: typical practices, time required to implement decisions, and how weather conditions influence those decisions; expected field conditions under good weather.
  - Key climate risks: identification and ranking of top 3 climate-related risks for each month; assessment of how these risks affect farming decisions.
  - Use of weather/climate information (Section 3)
    - Divides participants into those who receive weather information and those who do not.
    - For receivers: what information is used, sources, delivery format, frequency, usefulness, trust, and conditions needed to act on the information.
    - For non-receivers: what information would be useful and preferred delivery methods/formats.
    - Questions about overall usefulness, potential improvements, and desired changes to information delivery.
  - Recalling and describing recent extreme season/year (Section 2.1)
    - Probes to identify the most critical weather risks/events, sources and timing of weather information, its usefulness for decision-making, and potential improvements.
    - Local knowledge and signs used to anticipate seasonal dry/wet conditions.
    - Discussion of possible adaptation strategies (e.g., alternative seeds, mulching, different crops) in response to anticipated extremes.

- Data quality and management
  - Quality control through cross-checks by researchers and a local research assistant.
  - Data structured to align with the appendix protocol, with seasonal calendars highlighted as part of the dataset.

- Outputs and relevance for analysts
  - Enables examination of correlations between access to and use of weather/climate information and farming decisions across multiple EPAs and districts.
  - Supports assessment of spatial heterogeneity in agro-climatic perceptions and responses, leveraging EPAs with weather stations for comparative analysis.
  - Provides rich qualitative insights into how farmers interpret extremes, trust information sources, and adapt practices, informing enhancements to climate information delivery and early action strategies.

- Limitations and considerations for use
  - Data are qualitative and localized to selected EPAs with existing weather stations, which may constrain generalizability.
  - Potential language and translation nuances and reliance on self-reported practices and perceptions.
  - The data focus on the maize growing season; other crops and regions may require separate exploration.
