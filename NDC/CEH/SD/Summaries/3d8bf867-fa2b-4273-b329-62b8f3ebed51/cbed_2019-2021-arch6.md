# Overview The Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology (e.g. RoTaP, 2012)

- CBED produces 1x1 km gridded deposition data for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations, using measured air concentrations, precipitation data, and modelled ammonia patterns.
- Outputs cover wet and dry deposition components for vegetation, including occult deposition (cloud droplets) in wet deposition.
- Results are provided as rolling 3-year means (2019–2021) to smooth inter-annual variability, expressed as keq ha-1 year-1; data are available for moorland, forest/woodland, and as a grid-average.

## Data inputs and modelling framework

- Dry deposition: driven by gridded gas and particulate concentrations, combined with habitat-specific deposition velocities for five land cover types (forest, moorland, fertilised grassland, arable, urban).
- Wet deposition: derived from annual precipitation maps (5x5 km) and includes direct/occult deposition onto vegetation.
- Downscaling: 5x5 km resolution results downscaled to 1x1 km by bilinear interpolation.
- Habitat assignment for critical loads: deposition values for moorland/short vegetation applied to non-woodland habitats; forest values applied to woodland habitats.
- Key data inputs:
  - Nitric acid (HNO3) concentrations interpolated from ~30 sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 from the PCM model (interpolated rural measurements + sources/lines sources like roads).
  - Ammonia (NH3) concentrations at 3x3 km from EMEP4UK; UK NH3 emissions from NAEI (1 km resolution); non-UK emissions at 0.1° CEIP resolution.
  - Emission year 2019 used for 2019–2021; meteorology via WRF v4.2.2 with NCEP/NCAR GFS assimilation.
- Calibration: EMEP4UK NH3 outputs calibrated to NAMN measurements using linear regression to adjust model concentrations; stations with insufficient data or non-representative surroundings are excluded.

## Weather, enhancement, and inter-annual considerations

- Orographic enhancement factor applied to precipitation in upland regions to reflect higher ion concentrations (seeder-feeder effect).
- Inter-annual variations in deposition are significant due to weather; CBED results for exceedance calculations are averaged over a 3-year period to smooth these effects.
- Data are produced on an annual basis but presented as rolling 3-year means for two ecosystem types.

## Data outputs and structure

- Three main deposition files (2019–2021, rolling 3-year means):
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2019-2021.csv
    - Columns include easting, northing, and deposition terms: nox_m (oxidised N), nhx_m (reduced N), nms_m (non-marine S), nm_ca_mg_m (non-marine base cations).
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2019-2021.csv
    - Columns: nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f.
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2019-2021.csv
    - Columns: nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga.
- Ammonia concentration file:
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2019-2021.csv
    - Columns: nh3_c (ammonia concentration, μg m-3, landcover independent).
- Each row provides grid-cell center coordinates (easting, northing) and region-specific deposition values or concentration.
- Units:
  - Deposition values: keq ha-1 year-1 (convertible to kg S ha-1 year-1 or kg N ha-1 year-1 using standard multipliers).
  - Ammonia: μg m-3.

## Data quality and validation

- CBED data and calculations have undergone extensive peer review and participated in Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
- Methods are documented, version-controlled, and locally stored; mass balance checks ensure numerical consistency and alignment with previous years.

## Usage and interpretation

- Critical load calculations: use moorland (short vegetation) or forest deposition values appropriate to habitat; grid-average deposition is suitable for total deposition load assessments.
- Data can be converted to alternative units (kg S ha-1 year-1, kg N ha-1 year-1) using specified multipliers.
- Suitable for habitat risk assessment, deposition load estimation, and temporal trend analysis.
- Users should note inter-annual variability and the smoothing effect of the 3-year mean.
