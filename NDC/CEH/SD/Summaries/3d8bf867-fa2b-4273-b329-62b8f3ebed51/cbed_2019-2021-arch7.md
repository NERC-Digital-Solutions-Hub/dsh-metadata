# Overview The Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- Purpose: Produces 1x1 km gridded deposition data for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations in the UK, combining measured air concentrations, precipitation data, and modelled ammonia patterns to map deposition (wet, dry, and occult deposition) onto vegetation across land-cover types.
- Outputs include: grid-average deposition and habitat-specific deposition for five land-cover categories (forest, moorland, fertilised grassland, arable, urban); downscaling from 5x5 km to 1x1 km using bilinear interpolation; rolling 3-year means for annual data.

## Data inputs and modelling

- Nitric acid (HNO3) concentrations interpolated from ~30 sites.
- NO2 and SO2 concentrations drawn from the PCM (Pollution Concentration Mapping) model, combining rural measurements with point/line source modelling (e.g., roads).
- Ammonia (NH3) concentrations at 3x3 km resolution from EMEP4UK; UK NH3 emissions from the National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI) at 1x1 km; non-UK emissions from CEIP data (0.1° x 0.1° grid).
- Emissions year: 2019 used for modelling for 2019–2021 (2020–2021 not fully available due to Covid impacts); meteorology driven by WRF v4.2.2 with data assimilation from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (GFS at 1°x1° every 6 hours).
- Ammonia concentration calibration: linear regression against measured NH3 from the UKEAP NAMN network; stations required at least 70% annual coverage; outliers removed.
- Wet deposition mapping includes an orographic enhancement factor for upland precipitation (seeder-feeder effect) based on Great Dun Fell and Holme Moss observations.
- Inter-annual variability is significant; CBED deposition for exceedance calculations uses a 3-year rolling mean to smooth variability.
- Outputs are annual values but provided as rolling 3-year means for two ecosystem types within each grid cell: short vegetation and forest/woodland; units are per-area (kg per hectare per year).

## Data structure and available files (2019–2021)

- CBED-deposition-moorland-2019-2021.csv
  - Columns include: easting, northing (centre of 1x1 km grid, metres); deposition to moorland for oxidised nitrogen (nox_m), reduced nitrogen (nhx_m), non-marine sulphur (nms_m), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_m).
- CBED-deposition-forest-2019-2021.csv
  - Columns: easting, northing; deposition to forest for nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f.
- CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2019-2021.csv
  - Columns: easting, northing; grid-average deposition for nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga.
- CBED-ammonia-conc-2019-2021.csv
  - Columns: easting, northing; ammonia concentration (nh3_c) in μg m^-3 (landcover independent).

- All datasets use 1x1 km grid cells; easting/northing provided in metres.

## Units and interpretation

- All deposition values are expressed as keq ha^-1 year^-1.
- Conversion factors:
  - Sulphur deposition to kg S ha^-1 year^-1 = keq ha^-1 year^-1 × 16
  - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition to kg N ha^-1 year^-1 = keq ha^-1 year^-1 × 14
  - Non-marine base cations deposition to kg Ca ha^-1 year^-1 = keq ha^-1 year^-1 × 20

## Quality control and provenance

- CBED data subject to extensive peer review; part of Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
- Methods published in peer-reviewed literature; development approvals and version control in a central repository.
- Mass-balance checks and cross-year comparisons ensure numerical consistency.

## Practical considerations and usage

- Grid-average deposition is suitable for estimating total deposition load (e.g., catchments) but not appropriate for habitat-specific deposition rates.
- Habitat-specific deposition (moorland and forest) is provided to support critical-load exceedance assessments per ecosystem type.
- Inter-annual variability is smoothed via rolling 3-year means; annual values are represented as these rolling means to reduce noise.
- Wet deposition includes direct precipitation and cloud droplet deposition (occult) for mapped species; deposition to vegetation encompasses gases (SO2, HNO3, NO2) and PM components (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, Ca, Mg).

## Context and references

- Methodology and inputs draw on UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Atmospheric Pollutants (UKEAP) assets and related modelling frameworks (e.g., RoTaP, 2012; EMEP4UK; PCM).
- Key data sources include NAMN for ammonia measurements and NAMN-based calibration; WRF meteorology with NCEP/NCAR reanalysis assimilation; Great Dun Fell/Holme Moss observational studies for orographic enhancement.
