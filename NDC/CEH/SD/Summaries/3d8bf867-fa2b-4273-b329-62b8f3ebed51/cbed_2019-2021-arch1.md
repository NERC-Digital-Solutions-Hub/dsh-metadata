# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) Methodology

## Overview
- CBED generates 1x1 km gridded deposition data for sulfur, oxidised nitrogen, reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations, using measured gas/PM concentrations and ions in precipitation plus modeled ammonia patterns.
- Data sources include the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants network (UKEAP) and annual precipitation maps from the UK Met Office.
- Wet deposition accounts for precipitation deposition and direct cloud-drop deposition (occult deposition); dry deposition covers gases (SO2, HNO3, NO2, NH3) and particulate matter onto vegetation.
- Deposition values are downscaled from 5x5 km to 1x1 km via bilinear interpolation; grid-average deposition is used for total load assessments, while habitat-specific deposition uses land-cover-based assignments (moorland/short vegetation vs forest/woodland).
- Results are provided as rolling 3-year means (annual values calculated but presented as 3-year means) and expressed as keq ha^-1 yr^-1.

## Data Outputs and Structure
- Three ecosystem-specific deposition datasets per 1x1 km grid cell:
  - Moorland deposition (nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m, nm_ca_mg_m)
  - Forest/woodland deposition (nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f)
  - Grid-average deposition (nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga)
- Ammonia concentration dataset (nh3_c) at 3x3 km resolution (μg m^-3), not land-cover dependent.
- Data files (2019-2021) include:
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2019-2021.csv
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2019-2021.csv
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2019-2021.csv
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2019-2021.csv
- Each file includes:
  - Easting and northing (metres) for the 1x1 km grid cell center.
  - Deposition values per ecosystem type (keq ha^-1 yr^-1) for the defined components.

## Data Inputs, Modelling, and Calibrations
- Nitric acid (HNO3) concentrations interpolated from ~30 measurement sites.
- NO2 and SO2 concentrations from PCM (interpolated rural measurements plus modeled road/point sources).
- NH3 concentrations at 3x3 km resolution from EMEP4UK, using NH3 emissions from NA EI at 1x1 km resolution (UK) and CEIP data for non-UK emissions.
- Emission year 2019 used for 2019–2021 modeling; 2020–2021 data limited due to Covid impacts.
- Meteorology driver: Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) v4.2.2 with 1°x1° NWP reanalysis nudging (GFS/NCEP).
- Ammonia concentrations calibrated to UKEAP NAMN measurements via linear regression, scaling model outputs to match observed concentrations. Stations with insufficient coverage or non-representative surroundings are excluded.
- Orographic enhancement applied to wet deposition in upland regions (seeder-feeder effect) using observational factors from Great Dun Fell and Holme Moss studies.
- Inter-annual variability: 3-year mean deposition used to smooth variability due to weather and emission fluctuations.

## Temporal Scope and Averaging
- Calculations are annual, but results are provided as rolling 3-year means to mitigate inter-annual fluctuations.
- Deposition data are reported for two ecosystem types per grid cell (moorland and forest/woodland) and as a grid-average for overall load assessment.

## Units and Conversions
- Recorded deposition values: kilo-equivalents per hectare per year (keq ha^-1 yr^-1).
- Conversion to kilograms per hectare per year:
  - Sulfur: keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 16 = kg S ha^-1 yr^-1
  - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen: keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 14 = kg N ha^-1 yr^-1
  - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg) as calcium equivalents: keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 20 = kg Ca ha^-1 yr^-1
- Ammonia in precipitation and other components are presented in keq ha^-1 yr^-1 and converted as above when needed.

## Quality Control and Documentation
- CBED data subjected to extensive peer review and part of Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
- Methods follow QA guidelines for government analytical models; mass balance checks ensure numerical consistency with prior years.
- Versioning and central storage of code; datasets and method developments are documented and archived.

## Data Use and Habitat Specificity
- For critical load exceedance, deposition values are applied by habitat type:
  - Moorland/short vegetation receive moorland deposition values.
  - Woodland/Habitat deposition uses forest deposition values.
- Grid-average deposition provides a total deposition load (e.g., for catchments), while habitat-specific values allow ecosystem-level impact assessments.
