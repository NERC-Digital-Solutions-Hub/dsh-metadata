# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

## Purpose and Scope
- Produces 1x1 km gridded deposition data for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations in the UK.
- Combines measured air concentrations and precipitation ions with modelled ammonia patterns to estimate wet and dry deposition.
- Provides grid-average deposition and species-specific deposition for habitat categories (moorland/short vegetation and forest/woodland) to support total deposition assessments and critical loads calculations.
- Deposition values are annual but presented as rolling 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability; outputs cover two ecosystem types within each grid cell.

## Data Inputs and Modelling
- Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 measurement sites.
- NO2 and SO2 from the PCM (Pollution Concentration Mapping) model, blending rural measurements with sources and road contributions.
- Ammonia concentrations at 3x3 km from EMEP4UK (EMEP MSC-W CTM); UK NH3 emissions from NAEI (1x1 km); non-UK emissions from CEIP (0.1° × 0.1°).
- Emissions year: 2019 used for 2019–2021 modelling; 2020–2021 limited by data availability due to Covid.
- Meteorology driven by WRF v4.2.2 with 1°×1° NCEP/NCAR GFS data assimilation; ammonia concentrations calibrated to NAMN measurements via linear regression using sites with ≥70% annual coverage.
- Orographic enhancement applied to wet deposition in upland regions, based on Great Dun Fell and Holme Moss observations.
- Inter-annual variability acknowledged; CBED deposition data are averaged over a 3-year period to produce stable estimates.

## Deposition Outputs and Timeframe
- Deposition values expressed as keq ha⁻¹ year⁻¹; conversions available to kg S ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ using stated multipliers.
- Outputs include:
  - Moorland deposition (nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m, nm_ca_mg_m)
  - Forest deposition (nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f)
  - Grid-average deposition (nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga)
  - Ammonia concentration (nh3_c) in μg m⁻³ (1 ecosystem-independent value)
- For each grid cell, results are provided as 3-year means for the two ecosystem types and as a grid-average figure.

## Data Structure and Files
- four main CSV files (2019–2021):
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2019-2021.csv
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2019-2021.csv
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2019-2021.csv
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2019-2021.csv
- Each file includes:
  - easting and northing (metres, OS GB grid centre)
  - deposition values per pollutant/type (keq ha⁻¹ year⁻¹)
  - column naming conventions indicate ecosystem type and pollutant (e.g., nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m, nm_ca_mg_m for moorland)

## Quality Assurance and Validation
- CBED data and methods have undergone extensive peer review and participated in Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
- Methods are published in peer-reviewed literature; development and approvals tracked by senior oversight.
- Documented versioning, central code storage, and mass-balance checks against prior years to ensure numerical consistency.

## Uncertainties and Interpretation
- Inter-annual weather variability affects deposition; rolling 3-year means mitigate this.
- Downscaling from 5x5 km to 1x1 km introduces interpolation uncertainty.
- Calibration relies on NAMN ammonia measurements; potential biases in stations or non-representative areas are mitigated by data coverage criteria.
- Wet deposition includes occult deposition (cloud droplet deposition) and orographic enhancement, which carry additional uncertainties due to atmospheric processes.
