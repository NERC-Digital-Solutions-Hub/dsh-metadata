# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

## Purpose and outputs
- Produces 1x1 km gridded data of deposition for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations at 1 km resolution.
- Combines measured gas/PM concentrations and precipitation/ion data with modelled ammonia patterns to estimate wet and dry deposition on vegetation.
- Distinguishes deposition to five land-cover categories (forest, moorland, fertilised grassland, arable, urban) and computes grid-average deposition weighted by land-cover areas.
- Wet deposition includes direct cloud interception (occult deposition); dry deposition covers gases (SO2, HNO3, NO2) and PM onto vegetation.
- Downscales 5x5 km results to 1x1 km using bilinear interpolation; grid-average is for total deposition loads, while habitat-specific deposition is used for ecological assessments (e.g., critical loads).

## Data inputs, modelling and calibrations
- Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 measurement sites; NO2/NO3 concentrations from PCM model (interpolated measurements plus source-based modelling).
- Ammonia concentrations at 3x3 km from EMEP4UK (EMEP MSC-W model); UK NH3 emissions from NAEI at 1x1 km; non-UK emissions at 0.1° resolution (CEIP).
- Emission year 2019 used for 2019–2021 modelling; 2020–2021 data impacted by Covid-related inventory issues.
- WRF v4.2.2 used as meteorological driver with data assimilation of GFS/NCEP reanalysis at 1°x1° every 6 hours.
- Ammonia model outputs calibrated to NAMN measurements using linear regression; stations with ≥70% temporal coverage included, excluding non-representative sites.
- Orographic enhancement applied to wet deposition in uplands, based on observed ion concentration increases with altitude (Great Dun Fell, Holme Moss).
- Inter-annual variations acknowledged; 3-year rolling means used to smooth deposition variability; provides both annual data and rolling 3-year means.

## Data outputs and units
- Outputs provided as 3-year means for two ecosystem types within each grid cell: moorland and forest/woodland, plus grid average (1x1 km grid).
- Files include:
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2019-2021.csv
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2019-2021.csv
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2019-2021.csv
  - CBED-ammonia-conc-2019-2021.csv
- Units are keq ha-1 year-1; conversion factors available to convert to kg S ha-1 year-1, kg N ha-1 year-1, or kg Ca ha-1 year-1 as needed.

## Data structure and metadata
- Data described as 3-year means, with columns for easting and northing (centre of 1x1 km grid square) and deposition components:
  - Moorland: nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m, nm_ca_mg_m
  - Forest: nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f
  - Grid average: nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga
- Ammonia concentration dataset: nh3_c (μg m-3) with grid-centred coordinates.
- Values expressed in keq ha-1 year-1 for deposition; explicit guidance provided for unit conversions.

## Quality assurance and governance
- CBED data and methods subject to extensive peer review and part of Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
- Methods align with government QA practices; documented method developments, version control, and central storage of code.
- Mass-balance checks performed to ensure numerical consistency and comparability with prior years.

## Practical considerations for data leaders
- Data is UK-centric, grid-referenced (1x1 km) and time-stamped as 2019–2021 rolling means; suitable for ecosystem impact assessments (e.g., critical loads) and catchment-scale load estimation.
- Requires understanding of habitat-specific deposition versus grid-average deposition for policy and cross-sector collaboration.
- Data lineage includes multiple sources (UKEAP NAMN, PCM, EMEP4UK, NA EI, CEIP) and meteorological driver (WRF), with calibration steps and regional enhancement factors.
- Access and usage depend on Defra/CEH data portals; structure supports integration into GIS analyses and model inter-comparisons.
