# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

## Overview
- Produces 1x1 km gridded deposition data for oxidised nitrogen (nox), reduced nitrogen (nhx), non-marine sulphur (nms), and non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg) onto vegetation.
- Deposition estimates combine measured gas/PM concentrations, precipitation ion data, and modeled ammonia concentration patterns.
- Wet deposition uses annual precipitation maps and includes occult (cloud) deposition; dry deposition covers SO2, HNO3, NO2, NH3 and PM onto five land-cover types (forest, moorland, fertilised grassland, arable, urban).
- Grid-average deposition is used for total deposition load (e.g., catchment), while habitat-specific deposition is needed for critical-load assessments.
- 5x5 km inputs are downscaled to 1x1 km via bilinear interpolation; habitat-specific deposition uses moorland vs forest classifications.
- Deposition data are provided as rolling 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability (annual values exist but are averaged over three years).

## Data Inputs, Modelling and Calibrations
- Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 monitoring sites.
- NO2 and SO2 from PCM model data (interpolated rural measurements plus modeled point/line sources).
- Ammonia concentrations (NH3) at 3x3 km from EMEP4UK (UK application of EMEP MSC-W CTM).
- UK NH3 emissions at 1x1 km from NAEI; non-UK emissions at 0.1°x0.1° (CEIP data).
- Modelling year: 2019 used for 2019–2021; 2020 and 2021 data not available at time of modelling due to Covid impacts.
- Meteorology driver: Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) v4.2.2 with NCEP/NCAR GFS reanalysis data assimilation.
- Calibration: EMEP4UK ammonia outputs calibrated to NAMN measurements via linear regression; stations with ≥70% annual data used, excluding non-representative sites; year-specific exclusions applied as needed.
- Orographic enhancement: wet-deposition enhancement factor applied in upland regions based on observed altitude effects (Great Dun Fell and Holme Moss studies).
- Inter-annual variability: CBED deposition used for critical loads is averaged over a 3-year period; deposition values are provided as rolling 3-year means.

## Nature and Units of Recorded Values
- All deposition values: kilo-equivalents per hectare per year (keq ha^-1 yr^-1).
- Unit conversions:
  - Sulphur deposition to kg S ha^-1 yr^-1 = keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 16
  - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition to kg N ha^-1 yr^-1 = keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 14
  - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg) deposition to kg Ca ha^-1 yr^-1 = keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 20

## Data Outputs and Structure
- Outputs are 3-year mean ecosystem-specific deposition data for two ecosystem types within each grid cell:
  - Moorland (nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m, nm_ca_mg_m)
  - Forest/Woodland (nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f)
  - Grid average (nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga)
- Ammonia concentration file (nh3_c) provides ammonia concentration across grids (μg m^-3).
- Data files (2019-2021) are stored as CSVs with columns:
  - easting (m), northing (m)
  - deposition metrics per ecosystem type (keq ha^-1 yr^-1)
  - for ammonia: nh3_c (μg m^-3)
- Grid reference: OS Great Britain grid (1x1 km); values expressed at grid-centre coordinates.

## Quality Control and Governance
- CBED data and methods have undergone extensive peer review and participate in Defra model inter-comparisons.
- Methods are documented with version control, central storage of code, and mass-balance checks for numerical consistency.
- Results are published in peer-reviewed literature; method developments are managed by senior responsible officers.
- Metadata and data provenance are emphasized to support data sharing and verification, aligned with data governance practices.

## Notes on Use
- Grid-average deposition is suitable for total deposition loads (e.g., catchments) but not for habitat-specific deposition rates.
- For critical-load exceedance, deposition values are matched to habitat proxies (moorland/short vegetation vs forest/woodland).
- Wet deposition accounts for occult deposition and upland enhancements; inter-annual variability is mitigated by the 3-year mean approach.
