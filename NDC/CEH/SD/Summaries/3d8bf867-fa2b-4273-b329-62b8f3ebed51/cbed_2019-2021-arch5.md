# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

## Overview
- Produces 1x1 km gridded deposition data for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, ammonia concentration, and base cations at 1 km resolution.
- Based on measured atmospheric concentrations and precipitation ions, combined with modelled ammonia concentrations.
- Data sources include the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network and UK precipitation/meteorology inputs.
- Wet deposition includes precipitation deposition and occult cloud deposition; dry deposition covers gases (SO2, HNO3, NO2) and particulate matter onto vegetation across five land covers (forest, moorland, fertilised grassland, arable, urban).
- Grid-average deposition is used for total deposition load; habitat-specific deposition is applied for critical-load assessments (moorland/short vegetation to non-woodland habitats; forest deposition to woodland).
- Outputs are provided as rolling 3-year means, annual calculations averaged over three-year periods, and available as ecosystem-specific data (moorland, forest/woodland) plus grid-average values per 1x1 km cell and per-area deposition rates (kg ha-1 yr-1).

## Data Inputs, Modelling and Calibrations
- Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 sites.
- NO2 and SO2 from the PCM model, combining rural measurements with source-based modelling (roads, point sources).
- Ammonia concentrations (3x3 km) from EMEP4UK; UK NH3 emissions from NAEI at 1x1 km; non-UK emissions at 0.1° resolution (CEIP).
- Emissions year: 2019 used for 2019–2021 modelling; 2020–2021 data limited by Covid impacts; meteorology from WRF v4.2.2 with data assimilation from NCEP/NCAR GFS at 1° resolution.
- Ammonia model outputs calibrated to NAMN station measurements using a linear regression approach; stations with ≥70% coverage included, with exclusions for non-representative sites or years.
- Wet deposition mapped with an orographic enhancement factor to reflect upland precipitation concentrations (seeder-feeder effect), based on Great Dun Fell and Holme Moss measurements.
- Inter-annual variability acknowledged; CBED deposition data averaged over a 3-year period to smooth fluctuations.
- Data are calculated annually but delivered as rolling 3-year means for two ecosystem types (moorland and forest/woodland) with deposition rates expressed per unit area.

## Nature and Units of Recorded Values
- All deposition values: keq ha-1 year-1.
- Conversions:
  - Sulphur deposition to kg S ha-1 year-1: keq ha-1 year-1 × 16.
  - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition to kg N ha-1 year-1: keq ha-1 year-1 × 14.
  - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg) deposition to kg Ca ha-1 year-1: keq ha-1 year-1 × 20.
- Data structure provides three ecosystem-specific deposition values per grid cell: moorland, forest/woodland, and grid-average.

## Quality Control
- Extensive peer review over years; included in Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
- Methods extensively published; responsible officers approve method developments.
- Version control and centralized code storage; mass balance checks ensure numerical consistency and comparisons with previous years.

## Details of Data Structure
- 3-year mean, ecosystem-specific deposition data; two ecosystem types plus grid-average across each 1x1 km UK grid.
