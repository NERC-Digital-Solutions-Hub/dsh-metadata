# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 is available in multiple formats to suit different user requirements.

## Data formats

### Vector data
- Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land parcel with land cover attributes.
- Metadata describes how the information was derived (see Dataset Documentation).
- Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectare.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Coverage: UK.

### Raster data
- Five raster products; 25 x 25 meter raster gives the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 kilometer raster products summarize the 25 x 25 meter raster.
- Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
- Supply format: GeoTIFF.
- Coverage: UK.

## Coverage
- United Kingdom.

## Metadata and documentation
- Further information available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation, including:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets. 

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Availability in both vector (Shapefile) and raster (GeoTIFF) formats supports diverse analytical workflows and integration needs.
- Rich metadata and dedicated documentation enhance data discoverability, provenance, and suitability assessments.
- Spatial granularity differences (0.5 ha for vector; 25 m / 1 km for raster) require governance when harmonizing datasets for cross-format analyses.
- UK-wide coverage and versioning implications should be considered for governance, updates, and alignment with other data assets.
