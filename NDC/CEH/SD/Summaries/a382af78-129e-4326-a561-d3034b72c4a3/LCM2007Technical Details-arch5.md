# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides both vector and raster formats to accommodate diverse user needs.
- Coverage is the United Kingdom (UK).

## Data formats

### Vector data
- Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata describing how information was derived.
- Minimum Mapable Unit: 0.5 hectares.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Coverage: UK.
- See Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation for detailed descriptions.

### Raster data
- Five raster products in total.
- A 25 x 25 meter raster assigns the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
- Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
- Supply format: GeoTIFF.
- Coverage: UK.
- Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.

## Metadata and documentation
- Detailed metadata for raster formats are available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Additional information is organized in Tables within the documentation:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets.

## Governance and practical considerations for Data Stewards
- Supports data discovery and usability through clearly defined formats (vector and raster) and rich metadata.
- Freely available raster products enhance accessibility and sharing potential.
- Requires alignment of data delivery with user needs (e.g., accurate attribute metadata for vector data and comprehensive raster metadata).
- Multiple formats necessitate interoperability planning across systems and tools, with attention to metadata completeness and data lineage (derivation notes) as described in the documentation.
