# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- Land Cover Map 2007 provides UK land cover information in both vector and raster formats to support environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Data formats and content
- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: polygons represent land cover parcels with attributes describing land cover and metadata on derivation.
  - Minimum mapping unit: 0.5 hectares.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: UK.
- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total.
  - One 25 x 25 m raster giving the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarising the 25 x 25 m raster.
  - Supply formats: GeoTiff.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
  - Coverage: UK.

## Documentation and metadata
- Further information is in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Clear, structured data supports integration into reports, dashboards, and policy evaluations.
- Distinctions between vector (detailed parcels, 0.5 ha minimum) and raster (consistent grid-based Broad Habitat) influence analysis scale and methodological choices.
- Availability of detailed derivation metadata and standardized datasets enhances reproducibility and data governance when designing monitoring frameworks.

## Accessibility and usage notes
- Raster products include freely available 1 km rasters, facilitating broad access for monitoring activities.
- For thorough understanding of attributes, classes, and raster metadata, reference the Dataset Documentation (Tables 1–3).
