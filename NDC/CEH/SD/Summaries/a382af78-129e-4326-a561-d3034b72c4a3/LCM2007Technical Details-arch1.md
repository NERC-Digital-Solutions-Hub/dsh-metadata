# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides UK land cover information in both vector and raster formats to suit different user needs.
- Vector data models land cover as parcels (polygons) with attributes describing land cover and metadata on how the information was derived.
- Raster data offers landscape-wide summaries at multiple resolutions.

## Data formats

- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: parcels as polygons with land cover attributes and derivation metadata.
  - Minimum Mapable Unit: 0.5 hectares.
  - Supply Format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).

- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total.
  - 25 x 25 m raster: provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products: summarize the 25 m raster.
  - Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
  - Scale: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
  - Supply Format: GeoTiff.
  - Coverage: UK.

## Coverage and scale
- UK-wide coverage for both vector and raster products.
- Vector: 0.5 ha minimum mapping unit.
- Raster: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes, with 25 m providing detailed habitat per pixel and 1 km rasters offering summarized broad habitat information.
