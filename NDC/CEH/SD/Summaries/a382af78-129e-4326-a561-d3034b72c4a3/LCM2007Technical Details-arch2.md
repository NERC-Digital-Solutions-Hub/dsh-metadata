# Land Cover Map 2007

## Overview
- Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is provided in multiple formats to suit different users and analysis needs.
- Designed to support consistent environmental monitoring and enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Data formats and specifications

- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel.
  - Attributes describe land cover; metadata describes how the information was derived.
  - Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectares.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).

- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total.
  - A 25 x 25 m raster gives the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
  - Detailed metadata available in the LCM2007 Dataset Documentation.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
  - Supply format: GeoTiff.
  - Coverage: UK.

## Documentation and metadata

- Further information is provided in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation, including:
  - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes for LCM2007.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

## Relevance for monitoring and data management

- Supports standardized, comparable land cover data over time for environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Vector data offers detailed parcel-level information; raster data provides consistent broad habitat information at suitable scales for larger-area analyses.
- Clear metadata and documentation facilitate quality assurance, traceability, and data integration.
- Data are intended to be stored and accessible via appropriate data portals, aligning with standardised data management practices.
