# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard post-training survey

## Overview
- A survey instrument intended to assess field practices and biosecurity awareness following training.
- Participation requires consent for anonymous data use in research (University of Leeds).
- The document shows the survey structure and response options; as of the provided data, no responses have been recorded.

## Respondent information (present in survey)
- Demographics and roles (gender, age, role at organization, disciplinary area).
- Environment and field context (types of environments, number of field sites visited per week).
- Field activities and responsibilities (monitoring, sampling, habitat management, social research methods, supervising others).

## Key topics covered in the survey
- Field logistics and sites
  - Number and variety of field sites visited weekly; multi-site visits within a day.
  - Modes of transport to field sites; whether vehicles are taken on/off-road; site access considerations.
- Equipment and field hygiene
  - Use of equipment in the field; cleaning and drying routines before/at/after fieldwork.
  - Cleaning methods for footwear and outerwear; cleaning before arriving at sites, leaving sites, and upon return.
  - Specific cleaning actions (e.g., visible biomass removal, rinsing, hot water, detergents, disinfectants, drying).
  - Transport-related biosecurity (cleaning tyres/wheels or hulls before/after fieldwork; cross-site contamination controls).
- Biosecurity and INNS (invasive non-native species)
  - Perceived risk of field activities in spreading INNS.
  - Encounters with INNS in field areas; changes to field practices due to INNS presence.
  - Requirement and content of risk assessments related to INNS.
  - Familiarity with guidance or campaigns on biosecurity; training on biosecurity and providers of training.
  - Conscious biosecurity measures during field activities; readiness to challenge unsafe practices.
  - Planning considerations to minimize INNS spread (site knowledge, equipment duplication, visit sequencing, timing).
  - Supervisory responsibilities in ensuring biosecurity measures are followed.
- Training and support
  - Perceived usefulness of e-Learning modules for work and research relevance.
  - Availability of guidance, campaigns, and training organisations; responses currently show no recorded details.
- Open feedback
  - Free-text comments section for survey participants (present but with no responses in the provided data).

## Relevance to GIS Specialists
- The survey's emphasis on field practices directly impacts the quality, reliability, and integrity of GIS data collected in field environments.
- Biosecurity and INNS management are critical for preventing biological contamination and ensuring pristine spatial data collection across sites.
- Cleaning, cross-site contamination controls, and planning (site sequencing, multiple equipment sets) influence data provenance and metadata quality.
- Training and guidance uptake affect how field data collection aligns with standard GIS data standards and reproducible workflows.

## Status and next steps
- The instrument is ready for data collection, but the provided dataset contains no responses yet.
- Once responses are collected, expect insights into field hygiene practices, INNS risk management, and training effectiveness relevant to GIS-driven field data collection.
