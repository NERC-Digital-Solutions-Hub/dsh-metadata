# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard post-training survey

## Overview
- Post-training survey focused on field practices and biosecurity awareness.
- Targeted participants likely involved in field activities; instrument spans demographics, field procedures, equipment handling, and INNS (invasive non-native species) risk.
- Current display shows 0 responses across items; overall response rate noted as 48%, suggesting 48 total responses exist but none are visible in this view.

## Survey scope and structure
- Consent and anonymity: respondents consent to anonymous use of data for this and future research.
- Demographic/role data: gender, age, role, disciplinary area, and environment where field activities occur.
- Field activity and logistics: number of field sites per week, multi-site visits per day, modes of arrival, and transport considerations.
- Field activities and equipment: activities performed (monitoring, sampling, conservation), equipment usage, cleaning before arrival/departure/return, drying, and transport between sites.
- Cleaning methods: detailed options for cleaning equipment, footwear, and outerwear (visible biomass removal, rinsing, hot water, detergent, disinfectant, drying, etc.).
- INNS (invasive non-native species) focus: perceived risk, prior presence in field areas, management practices, risk assessments, guidance/training familiarity, and biosecurity measures during fieldwork.
- Planning and supervision: risk planning for INNS spread, duplicating equipment to avoid transfer, site visit sequencing, timing to avoid INNS spread, and supervision responsibilities.
- Training and usefulness: perceived usefulness and relevance of the e-learning module to work and research.

## Data points and potential metrics
- Field activity intensity: number of sites per week; multi-site days; travel modes.
- Cleaning and biosecurity practices: frequency of cleaning before/after site visits; methods used for equipment, footwear, and outerwear; drying practices.
- INNS risk management: perceived risk levels; prior INNS exposure; inclusion of INNS in risk assessments; awareness of guidance or training; implementation of procedures to reduce spread.
- Training impact: usefulness and relevance ratings for the e-learning module.
- Planning and supervision: presence of procedures to prevent INNS spread; communication to supervisees about INNS presence; planning steps to minimize risk.

## Data governance and quality implications
- Data type: primarily survey responses with Likert scales, multiple-choice, and Yes/No items.
- Privacy and consent: explicit consent for anonymous data usage; emphasis on anonymous reporting.
- Metadata needs: clear definitions for INNS, field environment categories, and each cleaning method to enable cross-study comparability.
- Current data status: no responses visible in this view; potential missing data or incomplete collection pending.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Illustrates end-to-end data lifecycle in a domain with cross-site field activities and biosecurity concerns.
- Highlights importance of data discovery, standardization, and governance when collecting practice-related data across organizations or networks.
- Demonstrates the need for clear metadata and data dictionaries to enable meaningful analysis of behavior, risk, and training outcomes.

## Recommendations for moving forward
- Develop a data dictionary and standardized coding for all survey items (e.g., INNS terminology, cleaning methods, field environment types).
- Establish data governance practices: data ownership, access controls, retention, and versioning; define cadence for data collection and reporting.
- Ensure data quality: implement required fields, validation rules, and consistency checks to reduce missing or ambiguous responses.
- Enable interoperability: map survey fields to existing INNS and biosecurity datasets to facilitate integrative analysis.
- Build analytics and dashboards: track compliance indicators, training uptake, and risk mitigation effectiveness; enable cross-partner sharing where appropriate.
- Foster co-ownership: involve field teams and partner organizations in data interpretation and product development to enhance applicability and adoption.

## Next steps
- Finalize instrument deployment and ensure timely collection of responses.
- Publish anonymized results with accompanying metadata and data dictionary to support reuse and cross-network learning.
- Use findings to refine field biosecurity practices, training materials, and associated governance processes.
