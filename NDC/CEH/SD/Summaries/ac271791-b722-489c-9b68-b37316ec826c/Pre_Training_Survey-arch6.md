# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard pre-training survey

- Purpose and consent
  - Aimed at collecting data on field practices and biosecurity for research by the University of Leeds.
  - Consent requested for anonymous use of responses in this and future research.

- Survey structure and scope
  - Broad, field-based questionnaire spanning demographics, disciplinary context, field locations, equipment use, cleaning practices, transport, site interactions, and biosecurity risk management.
  - Includes both closed (single/multi-select, yes/no) and open-text questions; many open fields provided but unfilled in the current snapshot.

- Data categories collected
  - Respondent background
    - Gender, age, role within organization, and disciplinary area (e.g., environmental science, ecology, geography, etc.).
  - Field operations and locations
    - Geographic scope (UK vs overseas), field sites per week, whether multiple sites are visited in a day, and typical field environments (woodland, freshwater, marine, urban, agricultural, etc.).
  - Field activities and equipment
    - Activities such as monitoring, sampling, habitat management, social research methods, and supervision.
    - Equipment usage, transfer of samples between sites, and care routines (cleaning before arrival, during, and after field work; drying; re-use across sites).
    - Cleaning methods for footwear and outerwear, including hand-picking biomass, rinsing, washing with detergent, disinfection, and drying.
  - Transport and site access
    - Modes of travel to field sites (on foot, car/bicycle, boat, etc.) and vehicle hygiene practices (tyres/wheels cleaning before/after visits; drying between site visits).
  - INNS (invasive non-native species) risk and biosecurity
    - Perceived risk of spread from activities, consideration of INNS during fieldwork, prior experience with INNS in the field, and whether risk assessments are required or completed.
    - familiarity with guidance or campaigns on biosecurity; training history related to biosecurity.
  - Risk assessment and governance
    - Whether risk assessments are produced, whether INNS are mentioned or addressed in risk assessments, and whether procedures to reduce INNS spread are specified.
    - Supervisory responsibilities and communication about INNS within teams.

- Data quality and current state (observations from the snapshot)
  - The provided responses show zero selections for many items (e.g., gender, age, most environment options, and many sub-questions), indicating either an incomplete data capture in this extract or placeholder responses.
  - Large sections are structured with multi-answer and conditional follow-ups, suggesting a comprehensive plan for capturing nuanced field practices and biosecurity behaviors.

- Potential data products and analyses for Data Support
  - Descriptive dashboards
    - Frequency and distribution of field environments, equipment cleaning methods, and transport practices.
  - Risk and compliance insights
    - Prevalence of INNS risk awareness, training coverage, and integration of INNS considerations into risk assessments.
  - Practice effectiveness
    - Correlations between cleaning protocols and reported risk mitigation (e.g., avoidance of cross-site contamination).
  - Geographic and site-level analytics
    - Site clustering by field type and cleaning/regimen adherence to identify training or resource gaps.
  - Policy and training impact
    - Tracking familiarity with biosecurity guidance and changes over time, linked to training events.

- Practical implications for Data Support archetype
  - The survey provides a rich blueprint for capturing standardized data to enable self-serve exploration of field biosecurity practices.
  - To maximize usefulness, ensure clear data dictionaries, consistent coding for multi-select questions, and robust data validation to minimize null responses.
  - Enable data products that stakeholders can filter by environment type, site frequency, and transport methods to tailor interventions and training.

- Data governance and ethics considerations
  - Anonymous data usage is anticipated; maintain privacy through appropriate de-identification and secure handling of responses.
  - Clear documentation of consent and data usage terms for future research.

- Suggested next steps for implementation
  - Implement standardized data validation and coding guides to reduce missing or inconsistent responses.
  - Develop a data dictionary mapping each question to a field in the data model, including handling rules for multi-select and conditional questions.
  - Create a plan for regular data collection cycles to monitor changes in biosecurity practices and INNS risk management.
