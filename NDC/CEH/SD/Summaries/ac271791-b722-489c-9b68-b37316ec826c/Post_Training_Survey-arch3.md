# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard post- training survey

## Overview
- A field-focused survey designed to assess post-training biosecurity practices and INNS (invasive non-native species) risk management in field activities.
- Aims to identify how environmental health measures are applied in practice, informing policy scrutiny, monitoring approaches, and future decisions.
- Includes consent for anonymous data use and collection of demographic and procedural information.
- Currently shows 0 responses across all items, with a 48% response rate reported, suggesting this is a draft or early deployment.

## Survey structure and content
- Consent and anonymity: participants confirm understanding and consent for anonymous data use.
- Demographics and role: gender, age, role at organization, and disciplinary area.
- Field context: environments where fieldwork occurs, typical number of field sites per week, whether multiple sites are visited in a day, and common field activities (monitoring/surveying, sampling, habitat management, social research methods, supervision).
- Equipment use and cleaning: frequency and methods of cleaning equipment before arriving, while at, and after leaving sites; drying practices; use of the same equipment across sites; on-site and post-site cleaning protocols.
- Transport and site access: how participants travel to sites, whether vehicles are taken on- or off-road, and how transport-related decontamination is handled (e.g., tires/wheels/hull cleaning).
- Personal gear cleaning: cleaning methods for footwear and outerwear, including methods like visible biomass removal, rinsing, hot water, soaking, detergent, and disinfectants; drying practices between site visits.
- INNS (invasive non-native species) focus: frequency of INNS-related issues in field activities, perceived risk, prior experiences with INNS presence, and any changes to practices as a result; awareness of guidance or campaigns; training on biosecurity.
- Risk assessment and planning: exposure of risk assessments to INNS considerations, procedures defined to reduce transfer in risk assessments, planning to check INNS presence at sites, preventing duplicate equipment transfer, and sequencing of site visits to minimize risk.
- Supervision and culture: how biosecurity is communicated to those supervised and whether biosecurity measures are enforced among team members.
- Training effectiveness: perceived usefulness of the e-Learning module for work and research relevance.
- Open comments: a space for general feedback or observations about the survey or biosecurity practices.

## Respondent data and status
- The survey lists extensive questions and response options, but currently contains 0 responses for all items, with a stated response rate of 48%. This indicates data collection is in early stages or this entry is a draft version.

## Key themes relevant to monitoring frameworks
- Behavior-focused monitoring: emphasis on daily field practices, cleaning regimes, and transport-related decontamination as measurable indicators of biosecurity compliance.
- INNS risk management: evaluation of awareness, training, and tangible risk-reduction actions in field planning and execution.
- Data and governance readiness: concepts of data sharing (anonymity consent present), metadata quality, and the need for standardized reporting to enable aggregation across programs.
- Training uptake and usefulness: assessment of e-Learning tools and alignment with field workflows.
- Planning and coordination: questions about sequencing visits, duplication of equipment to avoid transfer, and site-specific INNS knowledge as ways to minimize cross-site contamination.

## Data governance and practical considerations
- Data sensitivity and openness: survey explicitly seeks anonymous data, with potential public sharing of underlying data, which can influence willingness to participate and data quality.
- Metadata and standardization: the large number of specific cleaning methods and site logistics imply a need for clear definitions and consistent metadata to enable comparability.
- Timeliness and completeness: current zero responses highlight the importance of follow-up, engagement strategies, and clear guidance on how to complete and submit results.
- Representativeness and bias: reliance on self-reported practices may introduce bias; triangulation with observational data or audits could strengthen monitoring outcomes.

## Endnotes
- The document functions as a comprehensive instrument for capturing field-level biosecurity practices and INNS risk management, intended to inform environmental health monitoring policies.
- To maximize utility for monitoring frameworks, future iterations should ensure adequate respondent engagement, clear definitions, and robust data governance processes, with attention to metadata quality and data sharing norms.
