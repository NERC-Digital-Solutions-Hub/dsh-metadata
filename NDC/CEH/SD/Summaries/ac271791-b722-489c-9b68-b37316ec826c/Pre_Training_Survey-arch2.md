# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard pre-training survey

## Purpose and scope
- A pre-training survey aimed at capturing field practices and biosecurity considerations related to field activities.
- Designed to inform data-driven assessment of environmental monitoring practices and biosecurity risk management.
- Consent for anonymous use of responses for this and future research.

## What data the survey collects (key areas)
- Demographics and roles
  - Consent and basic demographic options (gender, age) and role at the organization.
  - Disciplinary area(s) describing respondent’s work or volunteering.
- Field locations and activity context
  - Where field activities are conducted (UK, overseas) and protected area exposure.
  - Environments in which fieldwork occurs (woodland, freshwater, marine, urban, agricultural, etc.).
  - Typical number of field sites visited per week; whether multiple sites are visited in one day.
- Samples and equipment
  - Whether samples or equipment are taken back/forward between sites.
  - Import/export/quarantine procedures for samples.
  - Types of field activities (monitoring/surveying, sampling, habitat management, social research methods, supervising others, etc.).
  - Equipment usage and contact with field substrates (water, soil, vegetation, animals, etc.).
- Field transport and site access
  - Modes of arrival at field sites (on foot, by vehicle, by boat, etc.).
  - Use and cleaning of vehicles with respect to tyres, hulls, and driving on/off-road.
  - Drying and drying practices for equipment between uses; cleaning frequency before/after site visits.
- Cleaning and decontamination practices
  - Cleaning methods for equipment, footwear, and outerwear (hand-picking biomass, rinsing with cold/hot water, detergent, disinfectants, drying).
  - Specific questions on cleaning timing (before arriving, before leaving, upon return) and what surfaces are cleaned.
  - Cleaning methods for footwear and outerwear across similar timeframes.
- Invasive non-native species (INNS) risk and biosecurity
  - Perceived and actual risk of INNS from field activities.
  - Whether field activities have occurred in areas with known/suspected INNS, and any changes made as a result.
  - Whether risk assessments for field activities are required and whether INNS are mentioned or addressed.
  - Familiarity with guidance or campaigns on biosecurity; training on biosecurity and who provided it.
  - Conscious biosecurity measures during fieldwork; avoiding contact with INNS; confidence to challenge risky practices.
  - Planning and timing measures to minimize INNS spread (site sequencing, timing to avoid high-risk periods, etc.).
  - Supervisory responsibilities related to INNS information and ensuring biosecurity measures.
- Risk assessment and training
  - Existence and content of risk assessments; whether INNS issues were raised and procedures described.
  - Training history related to biosecurity and INNS; organizations providing training.
- General survey feedback
  - Open comments field for any additional observations about biosecurity or field practices.

## How data will be used by Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- To establish standardized representations of field practices and biosecurity measures across sites and teams.
- To verify and quality-assure data from diverse monitoring activities.
- To enable clear formats (reports, maps, charts) that support environmental health and policy performance analysis over time.
- To store and upload collected datasets to appropriate data portals, facilitating data sharing and re-use.

## Data quality, governance, and accessibility considerations
- Emphasizes anonymised data for research use.
- Uses standardized questions and response options to support cross-site comparisons.
- Aims to increase the value of datasets by enabling integration with other environmental data sources and ensuring data accessibility beyond single-use outputs.

## Practical implications and next steps
- Encourages field practitioners to report on cleaning, transport, and INNS-related practices to build a comprehensive monitoring dataset.
- Highlights the need for ongoing participation to populate the survey and generate actionable insights for biosecurity improvements.

## Current status / observations
- The instrument as presented shows many items with no responses, indicating this is a survey instrument awaiting participant input.
