# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard pre-training survey

## Overview
- Aimed to collect information on field practices and biosecurity related to INNS (invasive non-native species) management.
- Participants consented to anonymous data use for this research project and future Leeds University work.
- Organization: University of Leeds; survey appears to have been designed for researchers and field practitioners.

## Data Collected (intended variables and structure)
- Respondent demographics and role:
  - Gender, age, role at organization, disciplinary area.
- Field activity geography:
  - Where field activities are carried out (UK, overseas) and country/counties.
- Field logistics and sample handling:
  - Sampling, samples/equipment brought back, import/export procedures.
- Field environments and sites:
  - Environments in which field activities occur; number of sites visited per week; multi-site per day.
- Equipment and cleaning practices:
  - Equipment used, cleaning frequency (before arriving, leaving, returning), drying, use across sites, and methods for cleaning footwear, outerwear, and other gear.
  - Transport-related cleaning (tyres/hulls), and whether equipment is shared or reused between sites.
- INNS and biosecurity risk:
  - Frequency of INNS-related issues, perceived risk of spreading INNS, familiarity with guidance, training status, and whether risk assessments are required.
  - Practices to avoid spreading INNS, and supervisory responsibilities regarding biosecurity measures.
- Training and guidance:
  - Familiarity with biosecurity campaigns/guidance and whether training has been undertaken.
- Open comments:
  - Section for free-text feedback about the survey.

## Data Quality and Completeness
- Across the document, most questions show zero responses (e.g., all fields blank or "0"), indicating no substantive data collected yet.
- Reported response rate (noted as 285%) appears inconsistent with the observed non-responses; likely data collection or transcription issues.
- Missing data across demographics, field practices, INNS questions, and training sections limit actionable insights from this snapshot.

## Data Governance Implications for Data Stewards
- Data completeness and integrity:
  - Prioritize data validation, fill-in checks, and consistent response capture to avoid mass nulls.
- Metadata and standardization:
  - Define clear data types, scales (e.g., Likert scales for risk and training), and controlled vocabularies for environments, roles, and locations.
- Privacy and consent:
  - Ensure ongoing anonymization and proper handling of potentially sensitive biosecurity-related responses.
- Versioning and provenance:
  - Implement version control for survey instruments and data schemas; document any changes to questions or categories.
- Interoperability and reuse:
  - Create a data dictionary or codebook to enable reuse by other teams; align with data governance frameworks for research surveys.
- Data updates and maintenance:
  - Establish a process for follow-up data collection, data cleaning, and updating datasets as responses accumulate.

## How this informs Data Steward Aims
- Supports governance by outlining structured data about field practices and biosecurity, enabling oversight of data quality and standardization.
- Highlights the need for robust metadata to facilitate discovery and appropriate use by researchers and practitioners.
- Emphasizes the importance of documenting data collection methods, consent, and data handling for future sharing and reuse.

## Recommendations for Data Stewards
- Immediately implement data validation rules to prevent zero-response submissions (e.g., required fields, predefined answer choices).
- Develop and publish a detailed data dictionary and codebook for all variables (demographics, field locations, equipment, cleaning practices, INNS-related questions, training).
- Standardize response formats:
  - Use fixed option sets for environment types, roles, and locations.
  - Use consistent time-based or frequency scales (Always/Often/Sometimes).
- Ensure privacy safeguards:
  - Confirm anonymization level and remove any personally identifiable information from datasets intended for sharing.
- Plan follow-up data collection:
  - Schedule reminders and provide clear instructions to respondents to improve completion rates.
- Prepare data for sharing:
  - Create a reusable dataset with accompanying metadata, data quality notes, and limitations due to non-responses.
- Address INNS and biosecurity emphases:
  - Consider adding explicit data quality checks for risk assessment questions and training indicators to better gauge preparedness and compliance.

End notes:
- Current snapshot shows minimal usable data; focus on improving response rate, data completeness, and standardized data collection for meaningful analysis and governance.
