# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard post-training survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Post-training survey to assess field practices, biosecurity measures, and awareness related to invasive non-native species (INNS).
  - Intended to inform risk reduction, training effectiveness, and guidance dissemination for field activities.

- Structure of the questionnaire (key sections)
  - Consent and demographics
    - Consent to anonymous data use; basic demographics (gender, age) and role at organization; disciplinary area.
  - Field context and environment
    - Environment(s) where field activities occur; typical field sites per week; whether multiple sites are visited in a day.
    - Types of field activities and purposes (e.g., monitoring, sampling, habitat/conservation work) and whether samples are transported between sites.
  - Equipment usage and field hygiene
    - Use of equipment in the field; frequency of cleaning before arriving, leaving, and returning from sites.
    - Drying practices between uses; cleaning methods before/after fieldwork; questions about cleaning routes for equipment and vehicles (tyres, hulls, etc.).
    - Specific cleaning methods requested for footwear and outerwear (e.g., biomass removal, rinsing, hot water, detergents, disinfectants, drying).
  - INNS risk and management
    - Perceived frequency and severity of INNS issues in field activities; whether field activities pose INNS spread risk; prior experience with INNS in known areas.
    - Whether risk assessments for field activities are required; inclusion of INNS considerations in risk assessments.
    - Familiarity with guidance or campaigns on biosecurity; prior biosecurity training; conscious use of biosecurity measures in the field.
  - Planning, supervision, and behavioral prompts
    - Planning to avoid INNS spread (e.g., using duplicate equipment, sequencing site visits, timing to avoid high-risk periods).
    - Informing and ensuring biosecurity measures when supervising others in the field.
  - Training impact and perceived usefulness
    - Perceived usefulness of the e-Learning module for work and for research; general usefulness and relevance ratings.
  - Open-format items
    - Space for name, email, and additional comments about the survey.

- Data collection design aspects
  - Predominantly multiple-choice with ordinal scales (Always/Often/Sometimes/Rarely/Never; Yes/No; Not applicable; 1–5 scales).
  - Multi-select answers for many items (e.g., cleaning methods, site planning options).
  - Some open-ended prompts for descriptive responses (e.g., changes made due to INNS presence; described procedures).

- Current data status and implications
  - The data excerpt shows no responses (all items marked with zero selections); a reported response rate line is present, but no respondent data fields are populated.
  - This indicates a lack of usable results in this snapshot, limiting any immediate analysis or correlations.

- Variables and potential analyses for future use
  - Cleaning and decontamination practices by item (methods, timing, and frequency).
  - Transport and cross-site contamination controls (sample transport, duplicate equipment use, site sequencing).
  - INNS risk perception and actual risk-reduction behaviors (risk awareness, training impact, and risk assessment practices).
  - Training usefulness and guidance familiarity as predictors of field biosecurity compliance.
  - Cross-tab analyses by field environment, discipline, or role to identify targeted training needs.

- Data quality considerations
  - Dependence on self-reported behavior; potential social desirability bias.
  - High potential for missing data given current zero-response snapshot; non-response bias considerations.
  - Complex multi-select and conditional questions require careful data encoding and metadata.

- Relevance to the Analysts Answering Questions with Data archetype
  - The survey is designed to generate data linking training, guidance familiarity, and practical field biosecurity behaviors.
  - Suitable for modeling correlations and predicting factors that reduce INNS spread risk in field activities.
  - Useful for informing policy, training content, and field protocol improvements if sufficient responses are collected.

- Recommendations for data collection and future use
  - Ensure clear, accessible distribution channels to maximize response rate.
  - Implement robust data capture for multi-select items (consistent coding and metadata).
  - Collect contextual metadata (site type, geography, team, timing) to enable local- and cross-site analyses.
  - Prioritize data quality checks and anonymization; plan for data sharing through appropriate portals with metadata.
