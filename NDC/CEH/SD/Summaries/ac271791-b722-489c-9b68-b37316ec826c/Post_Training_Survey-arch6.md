# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard post-training survey

- Purpose and scope
  - A post-training survey intended to understand field practices and biosecurity awareness related to invasive non-native species (INNS).
  - Administered by the University of Leeds; aims to collect anonymous responses for research and future studies.

- What data is collected
  - Demographics: consent, gender, age, role at organisation, academic role (if applicable).
  - Disciplinary areas and field environments (e.g., woodland, freshwater, marine, urban, agricultural) and typical field sites.
  - Field activity metrics: number of field sites visited per week, multi-site visits per day, types of field activities (monitoring/surveying, sampling, conservation management, social research methods, supervising).
  - Field equipment usage and cleaning: frequency of cleaning before/after site visits, drying between uses, re-use of equipment across sites, transport methods to field sites, road usage, cleaning of tyres/wheels/hull, and footwear/outerwear cleaning methods.
  - Cleaning methods: explicit listing of cleaning steps (visible biomass removal, rinsing, hot water, detergent, disinfectant, drying) and timing (before arriving, before leaving, upon return).
  - INNS risk factors: perceived risk from INNS, questions about managing risk and past experiences in INNS-affected areas.
  - Risk assessment and training: familiarity with guidance/campaigns, training in biosecurity, whether risk assessments mention INNS, and perceived usefulness of an e-learning module.
  - Planning and supervision: questions on planning to avoid INNS spread, duplicating equipment, sequencing field visits, supervising others, and informing supervisees about INNS presence.
  - Qualitative inputs: sections for free-text responses on species encountered, changes to practices, and additional comments.
  - Data capture notes: multiple questions allow multi-select responses; several items anticipate open-ended responses (e.g., 19.a species, 20.a.i procedures, 21.a guidance).
  
- Survey design and structure
  - Comprehensive, multi-part questionnaire covering:
    - Demographics and organisational context
    - Field activity logistics and site visitation patterns
    - Equipment usage, cleaning, and decontamination routines
    - Transport and site access hygiene (tyres, hulls, footwear, outerwear)
    - INNS risk awareness, guidance familiarity, and training
    - Risk assessment practices and planning for INNS spread
    - Supervisory responsibilities and communication about INNS
    - Perceived usefulness of e-learning modules
    - Opportunities for qualitative feedback
  
- Current data state observed in this extract
  - No responses are visible for any items (all options show zero selections or are blank).
  - The survey header indicates 48 responses, but the extract displays 0 responses for consent, demographics, and all substantive items.
  - Structure suggests readiness to collect detailed, field-focused data once responses are populated.

- Potential data products for Data Support archetype
  - Descriptive dashboards:
    - Proportion of respondents using each cleaning method (before arrival, before departure, return).
    - Frequency of equipment cleaning and drying across field activities.
    - Adoption rates of footwear and outerwear cleaning routines.
    - INNS risk perception and planning behaviors by site type.
  - Compliance and training insights:
    - Level of familiarity with guidance/campaigns and usefulness of e-learning.
    - Incidence of risk assessments mentioning INNS.
  - Planning and operational analytics:
    - Patterns in site sequencing to minimize INNS spread.
    - Duplication of equipment across sites to avoid INNS transfer.
  - Qualitative synthesis:
    - Thematic trends from free-text responses on changes in practices and specific INNS encounters.
  
- Data quality and governance considerations
  - High potential for missing data and non-responses, as evidenced by blank responses in this extract.
  - Need for consistent coding of Likert-style answers (Always/Often/Sometimes), and standardization of cleaning method labels.
  - Ensure proper handling of free-text fields (normalization, privacy considerations).
  - Anonymization and consent provenance to maintain participant confidentiality.
  - Data validation rules during data entry to minimize invalid or inconsistent responses (e.g., ensuring field-site counts align with weekly activity).

- Next steps and recommendations for data support
  - Validate data collection workflow to ensure responses are captured and stored correctly (address zero-input issue in this extract).
  - Implement data dictionary mapping for all multi-select options and cleaning method categories.
  - Develop a preprocessing pipeline to clean and standardize responses, enabling reliable aggregation.
  - Create templates for dashboards (Power BI/Tableau/Sheets) that align with the survey sections (cleaning, INNS risk, training, planning, supervision).
  - Plan cross-tab analyses (e.g., cleaning method usage by site type, INNS guidance familiarity by training status).
  - Propose a follow-up data collection cadence to improve response rates and reduce gaps.
  - Engage stakeholders to identify the top-priority metrics for actionable biosecurity improvements.
