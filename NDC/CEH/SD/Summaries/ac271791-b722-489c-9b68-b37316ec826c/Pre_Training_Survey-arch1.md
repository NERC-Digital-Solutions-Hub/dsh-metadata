# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard pre-training survey

## Overview
- Purpose: Aimed at collecting data on field practices, biosecurity measures, potential INNS (invasive non-native species) risks, training, and guidance familiarity to inform risk management and practice improvements.
- Scope: Survey of individuals conducting field activities, including sampling, equipment use, transport, cleaning, risk assessments, and supervision related to biosecurity and INNS.

## Survey structure and key sections
- Consent and demographics
  - Consent for anonymous use; basic demographic fields (gender, age) and role.
- Disciplinary area and roles
  - Areas such as environmental science, ecology, geography, biology, etc.; various academic and professional roles.
- Field activities location and samples
  - Locations (UK, overseas), sample/equipment handling, import/export procedures, and frequency of fieldwork in protected areas.
- Field environments and sites
  - Environments (woodland, freshwater, marine, urban, etc.); number of sites visited per week; whether multiple sites are visited in a day.
- Transportation and site access
  - Modes of arrival at field sites; off-road use; frequency of tyre/wheel cleaning; post-field site cleaning and drying of transport gear.
- Equipment and cleaning practices
  - Equipment use in the field; cleaning before arrival/after departure/return; drying; re-use of equipment at multiple sites; specific cleaning methods (hand biomass removal, rinsing, hot water, detergents, disinfectants, drying).
- Cleaning of footwear and outerwear
  - Methods for cleaning footwear and outerwear before arriving/leaving/returning from field sites.
- Field arrival and site practices
  - Arrival methods (on foot, vehicle, boat, etc.); road-use by vehicles; cleaning of tyres/wheels before/after field visits; drying between site visits.
- INNS risk and biosecurity measures
  - Perceived INNS risk, consideration of field activities to spread INNS, awareness of guidance/campaigns, training on biosecurity, and whether risk assessments include INNS considerations.
- Training, guidance, and compliance
  - Familiarity with guidance/campaigns, training received, conscious biosecurity measures during field activities, and whether INNS risk is discussed with supervisees or in risk assessments.
- Management and governance
  - Questions on risk assessment processes, procedures to reduce INNS spread, and whether INNS are known to be present at sites; supervisory responsibilities and communication of INNS presence.
- Open comments
  - Space for respondents to provide additional notes about the survey.

## Data status and gaps
- Current document shows 0 responses for all items, indicating no collected data yet.
- Structure is comprehensive, covering demographics, field practices, cleaning protocols, transport, INNS risk, training, and governance.
- Absence of responses limits any immediate analysis; highlights the need for data collection and response management.

## Potential analyses and insights (for data analysts)
- Descriptive statistics
  - Proportions using various cleaning methods (e.g., detergents, disinfectants, drying), transport modes, and site visitation patterns.
- Relationships and correlations
  - Link cleaning frequency and methods to INNS risk perceptions; association between training/training providers and adoption of biosecurity measures.
- Spatial and contextual patterns
  - Compare UK vs overseas field activities, and differences across environments (woodland, marine, urban, etc.).
- Risk assessment and procedures
  - Proportion of respondents who produce risk assessments; inclusion of INNS in assessments; procedures specified to reduce INNS spread.
- Training and guidance impact
  - Correlation between familiarity with guidance/campaigns and reported biosecurity practices.
- Data quality assessment
  - Identify gaps in data capture (missing sections, non-responses), potential biases, and areas needing clearer skip logic or mandatory fields.

## Data quality and collection considerations
- Uniformity and clarity
  - Many items rely on multiple-choice scales; ensure consistent interpretation and skip patterns.
- Missing data and nonresponse
  - With current data as zero responses, plan follow-ups, reminders, and validation checks to improve response rates.
- Metadata and provenance
  - Maintain clear records of respondents, consent, and data handling to support anonymization and reuse.
- Administrative details
  - Some sections (e.g., 29 Name, 30 Email) show no data; ensure proper data capture protocols if these fields are required.

## Recommendations for future data collection
- Pilot testing and clear instructions
  - Pilot the survey to refine questions, reduce ambiguity, and validate response options.
- Incentives and follow-ups
  - Implement reminders and consider incentives to improve participation among field practitioners.
- Data quality controls
  - Introduce mandatory responses for essential items, with sensible fallback options for non-applicable cases.
- Data governance
  - Establish metadata standards, versioning, and portal-based dataset discoverability with proper privacy safeguards.
- Analytical planning
  - Predefine key analyses (descriptive baselines, INNS risk correlations, training impact) to guide data collection and KPI development.

## Relevance to the "Analysts Answering Questions with Data" archetype
- The document is a thorough data-collection instrument essential for understanding field practices and biosecurity behaviors.
- Once populated, it enables analyses to identify practices associated with lower INNS risk, correlations between training and compliance, and regional or environmental variations in biosecurity adherence.
- Highlights typical data challenges for analysts in this domain, including data scarcity, accessibility of field data, and the need for standardized, high-quality datasets.
