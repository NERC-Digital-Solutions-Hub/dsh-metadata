# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard pre-training survey

- Overview
  - A pre-training survey focused on field practices and biosecurity, intended to collect information on demographics, field activities, equipment use and cleaning, transport, INNS (invasive non-native species) risk, risk assessments, training, and guidance familiarity.
  - The document currently shows no responses across the questions, indicating the data has not yet been captured or reported.

- What the survey covers
  - Consent and respondent demographics
    - Purpose of data use and anonymity
    - Gender, age, and role within the organization
    - Disciplinary areas of work or volunteering
  - Field activity scope and locations
    - Where field activities are conducted (UK, overseas), environments (woodland, freshwater, marine, etc.)
    - Frequency and variety of field sites visited per week
    - Multi-site fieldwork patterns (single vs. multiple sites per day)
  - Field procedures and materials
    - Sample collection and handling
    - Equipment usage and contact with field materials (water, soil, vegetation, animals)
    - Cleaning and decontamination practices for equipment
    - Methods and frequency of drying equipment between uses and site transitions
  - Travel and transport
    - Modes of arrival at field sites (on foot, vehicle, boat, etc.)
    - Whether vehicles are taken off-road and cleaning procedures for tires, hulls, and gear
  - Biosecurity and INNS risk
    - Perceived risk of spreading INNS and presence of INNS in field areas
    - Consideration of biosecurity measures and training
    - Use of risk assessments and inclusion of INNS guidance or procedures
  - Training, guidance, and awareness
    - Familiarity with biosecurity guidance or campaigns
    - Previous training on biosecurity
    - Conscious application of biosecurity measures during field activities
  - Supervisory and procedural practices
    - Communication of INNS presence to supervisees
    - Ensuring biosecurity measures are undertaken by teams
    - Strategies to minimize INNS spread (equipment management, site ordering, timing of visits)

- Data quality and governance implications for Data Leaders
  - Emphasis on standardized data collection about field practices and biosecurity
  - Metadata considerations implicit in the questions (e.g., environment type, site frequency, equipment types, cleaning methods)
  - Need for clear definitions and consistent response options to enable comparability across respondents and time
  - Potential to link field practice data with risk assessment outcomes and training records for holistic data governance

- Status and immediate implications
  - No responses captured yet; current instrument cannot yield analytical insights
  - Indicates a need to promote participation, ensure clear instructions, and possibly pilot testing to validate question clarity and flow

- Relevance for Data Leaders
  - Demonstrates a data-centric approach to capturing field practices and biosecurity procedures
  - Aligns with broader data strategy goals: understanding who is collecting data, what data is collected, how it is collected, and how it will be used to mitigate risks
  - Highlights opportunities to improve data discoverability, standardization, and reuse across teams and partner networks through comprehensive metadata and governance planning

- Next steps (for consideration)
  - Facilitate respondent engagement to obtain a representative set of field practice data
  - Define standardized terms and response scales to ensure consistency
  - Integrate this survey with existing data governance frameworks to support data quality, privacy, and discoverability
  - Plan for follow-up iterations to capture results, analyze patterns, and update training or guidance based on findings
