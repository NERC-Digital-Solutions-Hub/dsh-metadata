# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard post-training survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Post-training survey focused on field practices and biosecurity in environmental fieldwork.
  - Aimed at understanding how respondents implement field hygiene, equipment handling, INNS risk management, and related biosecurity measures.
  - Data intended for anonymous research by the University of Leeds and for informing future research.

- Respondents and data collection
  - Indicated response rate: 48%.
  - The extract shows questions across demographics, field activities, equipment use, transport, INNS biosecurity, training, and feedback.
  - Many response options appear with zero selections in this extract, suggesting either incomplete capture or non-responses in this view.

- Key content areas covered by the survey
  - Demographics and role
    - Role at organisation/company and academic/disciplinary area options provided (e.g., environmental science, geography, biology, etc.).
  - Field activities and sites
    - How many field sites are visited weekly; whether multiple sites are visited in a day.
    - Activities in the field: monitoring/surveying, sampling, habitat management, social research methods, supervising others.
    - Transport to field sites (on foot, vehicle, boat, etc.) and off-road driving considerations.
  - Field equipment and hygiene
    - Use of equipment in the field; cleaning before arrival, before departure, and upon return; drying between uses.
    - Cleaning methods used before/after field activities (e.g., biomass removal by hand, rinsing, hot water, detergent, disinfectants, drying).
    - Cleaning methods for footwear and outerwear; drying practices; handling of equipment across multiple sites in a day.
    - Transport-related hygiene (e.g., cleaning tyres/wheels or hulls before/after field visits).
  - INNS (invasive non-native species) biosecurity
    - Perceived risk of field activities spreading INNS; frequency of INNS-related issues in field activities.
    - Past field experiences where INNS were present; changes made to field practices as a result.
    - Requirement of risk assessments for field activities; inclusion of INNS considerations in risk assessments; familiarity with guidance or campaigns on biosecurity; training on biosecurity.
    - Conscious biosecurity measures during field activities; planning to avoid INNS spread (e.g., duplicating equipment, planning visit order, timing to avoid high-risk periods).
    - Supervisory responsibility for biosecurity measures and informing staff/teams about INNS presence.
  - Training, guidance, and e-learning
    - Familiarity with guidance or campaigns on biosecurity; training providers; perceived usefulness and relevance of e-learning modules.
  - Data, sharing, and comments
    - Open-ended comment field for survey feedback.
    - Questions related to accessibility of underlying data and data sharing were not explicitly captured in the visible extract, but are relevant to the archetype’s emphasis on data value and accessibility.

- Relevance to environmental monitoring and data practices
  - The survey aligns with the Analysts Monitoring the Environment aim to capture standardized, verifiable field practices and biosecurity behaviors.
  - It emphasizes consistent data collection on:
    - Field-site visitation patterns and activities.
    - Equipment hygiene and transport-related contamination controls.
    - INNS risk awareness, risk assessment practices, and training uptake.
  - Outputs from this survey could feed into:
    - Dashboards and reports that track compliance with biosecurity standards.
    - Aggregated datasets to evaluate trends in field hygiene practices over time.
    - Integration with INNS risk data to monitor potential pathways of spread.

- How this supports the analysts’ aims
  - Verification and quality assurance: standardized questions about cleaning methods, timing, and materials support consistent data quality across sites.
  - Transformation and outputs: data can be categorised (e.g., by cleaning method, INNS risk awareness) and visualised in reports, maps, and charts.
  - Data stewardship: the instrument implies storage and uploading to appropriate portals for dataset preservation and sharing.

- Opportunities and challenges for enhancing data value
  - Challenge: low visible responses in this extract; need for higher participation to enable meaningful analysis.
  - Opportunity: triangulate field practice data with external INNS occurrence data to assess risk pathways and intervention effectiveness.
  - Opportunity: link survey responses to training records and guidance uptake to evaluate the impact of biosecurity education on field behaviors.
  - Challenge: ensuring underlying data are accessible and usable by others for broader policy and research scrutiny.

- Recommendations for analysts
  - Improve participation and data completeness
    - Streamline consent and privacy notes; provide clear instructions to respondents.
    - Consider shorter, modular surveys to boost response rates.
  - Standardize data schema and terminology
    - Use consistent categories for field activities, equipment types, cleaning methods, and INNS-related terms.
    - Align with existing environmental monitoring data standards to facilitate integration.
  - Enhance data accessibility and interoperability
    - Publish anonymised datasets to the appropriate portals with metadata describing fields and coding.
    - Document data provenance, QA steps, and any transformations applied.
  - Leverage data for monitoring and policy performance
    - Develop indicators (e.g., percentage using recommended cleaning methods, percentage implementing INNS risk assessments).
    - Create dashboards to compare trends across sites, time periods, and training interventions.
  - Integrate with broader monitoring initiatives
    - Combine with INNS distribution and habitat data to assess potential spread risks and inform mitigation strategies.
    - Use results to tailor targeted biosecurity training and guidance campaigns.

- Endnotes
  - The instrument covers a comprehensive range of field practices and biosecurity concepts, reflecting the analytical focus on consistent, comparable environmental health data.
  - Realizing the full value of this survey hinges on robust participation, standardized data handling, and deliberate data sharing practices.
