# Field practices and biosecurity blackboard pre-training survey

- Purpose
  - To collect information on field practices and biosecurity measures in order to assess and mitigate the risk of spreading invasive non-native species (INNS) and to inform future monitoring and policy decisions.
  - Conducted as part of research by the University of Leeds to understand field-based environmental health practices and data governance considerations.

- Who is surveyed
  - Field researchers and staff involved in field activities across various environmental disciplines (demographic and role details are requested but not populated in this snapshot).

- What the survey covers
  - Consent and basic demographics
    - Purpose of data use in anonymous form for research.
    - Questions on gender, age, role, and disciplinary area.
  - Field activity locations and samples
    - Locations: UK and overseas; sampling and equipment handling; procedures for import/export/quarantine.
    - Protected areas and environment types (woodland, freshwater, marine, etc.).
  - Field frequency and logistics
    - Number of sites visited per week; multi-site per day; activities such as monitoring/surveying, sampling, habitat management, social research methods, supervising.
    - Transport between sites and whether equipment/samples are moved.
  - Equipment and sample handling
    - Types of equipment used; what equipment contacts on site (water, soil, vegetation, animals).
    - Cleaning and drying routines before arriving, between sites, and after returning; methods include hand biomass removal, rinsing (cold/hot), detergent, disinfectants, and drying.
    - Handling of equipment across multiple sites in a day.
  - Site arrival and transportation practices
    - Arrival methods (on foot, vehicle, boat, etc.); road use with/without off-road exposure.
    - Cleaning of tires/wheels/hulls and drying between visits; footwear and outerwear cleaning routines.
  - INNS risk and biosecurity awareness
    - Frequency of issues related to INNS in field activities; perceived risk without special measures.
    - Past field activities where INNS were present; changes in practices due to INNS.
    - Familiarity with guidance or campaigns on biosecurity; training on biosecurity; staff training providers.
  - Risk assessment and governance
    - Whether risk assessments are required; whether INNS are mentioned; procedures to reduce INNS spread.
    - Conscious biosecurity measures during fieldwork; ability to challenge unsafe practices.
    - Supervising staff: informing supervisees about INNS and ensuring biosecurity measures are undertaken.
  - Administrative inputs
    - Collection of respondent name, email, and any additional comments (space provided for comments).

- Current data status
  - This snapshot shows zero responses across all questions; an apparent data collection or reporting anomaly (noted as a response rate of 285%).

- Relevance to monitoring framework authors
  - Illustrates a wide range of data points needed to monitor field biosecurity practices and INNS risk management.
  - Highlights potential data governance needs, such as metadata quality, data sharing, and open data considerations for field-based datasets.
  - Reveals areas where standardized indicators could be developed (e.g., presence of cleaning protocols, existence of INNS risk assessments, training participation, and guidance familiarity) to inform policy evaluation and future monitoring strategies.
