# Hourly data (air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and lake temperature profile) from automatic water monitoring buoy from Blelham Tarn 2019

- Location and context: data from an automatic lake monitoring buoy on Blelham Tarn, Cumbria, England
- Measured variables:
  - Air temperature (°C)
  - Solar radiation flux (Pyranometer) in Watts per square metre
  - Wind speed (m/s)
  - Lake water temperatures at depths of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 m (°C)
- Sampling regime:
  - Data recorded every 4 minutes
  - Hourly averages calculated by an Oracle database
  - Example: 2 p.m. value is the average from 1 to 2 p.m., excluding 1 p.m. data, including 2 p.m. data
  - All times are in GMT
  - Timeframe: data from 2019
- Data quality and limitations:
  - Raw data not calibrated or quality controlled
  - Visual checks performed; obvious hardware errors removed
  - Gaps due to buoy maintenance or sensor/logger problems
- Data structure and accessibility:
  - Comma-separated values (CSV) file
  - Columns: Date GMT, 0.5m, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 6m, 7m, 8m, 9m, 10m, 12m temperatures; Air Temperature; Pyranometer; Wind Speed
  - Each column includes a description (e.g., depth or measurement type)
