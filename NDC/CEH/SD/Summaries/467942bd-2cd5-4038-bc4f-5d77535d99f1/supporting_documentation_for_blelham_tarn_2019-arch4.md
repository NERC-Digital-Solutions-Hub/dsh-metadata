# Hourly data (air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and lake temperature profile) from automatic water monitoring buoy from Blelham Tarn 2019. Feuchtmayr, H., Clarke, M., Maberly, S.C. (2022)

## Overview
- Location and scope: Data from an automatic lake monitoring buoy at Blelham Tarn, Cumbria, England.
- Measurements: Air temperature (°C), solar radiation flux (W/m²), wind speed (m/s), and lake water temperature profiles.
- Depth coverage: Lake temperature at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 m depths.
- Sampling cadence and timing: Measurements every 4 minutes; hourly averages computed (previous hour’s values averaged, excluding 1 p.m. data, including 2 p.m. data); times reported in GMT.
- Timeframe: Data collected in 2019.
- Instruments: Meteorological sensors on the buoy and platinum resistance thermometers for lake temperature.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Data processing: Hourly averages generated by an Oracle database.
- Data status: Raw data not yet calibrated or quality controlled; visual checks performed; obvious hardware-related errors removed.
- Gaps: Occasional gaps due to buoy maintenance or sensor/logger issues.
- Data structure: CSV format with clearly defined columns for time and temperatures at each depth, plus air temperature, pyranometer (solar radiation), and wind speed.

## Data structure and content
- Columns (with descriptions):
  - Date GMT: Date and time of measurement (GMT).
  - 0.5m, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 6m, 7m, 8m, 9m, 10m, 12m: Water temperature in °C at each depth.
  - Air Temperature: Air temperature in °C.
  - Pyranometer: Solar radiation flux in W/m².
  - Wind Speed: Wind speed in m/s.
- Units: Temperature in °C; solar radiation in W/m²; wind speed in m/s.
- Data format: Comma-separated values (CSV).

## Quality considerations and limitations
- Calibration: Data are raw and not calibrated; only basic quality checks performed.
- Data integrity: Some gaps due to maintenance or sensor/logger issues; visual checks used to remove hardware-induced anomalies.
- Metadata depth: Column descriptions and units are provided, aiding interpretation, but formal calibration and full QC metadata are not included in this dataset.

## Access, provenance, and funding
- Provenance: Data collected by autonomous lake buoy; hourly means derived from high-frequency measurements.
- Funding: Natural Environment Research Council grant NE/R016429/1, part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
