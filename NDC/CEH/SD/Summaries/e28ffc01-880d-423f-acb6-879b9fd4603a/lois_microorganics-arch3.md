# Phenyl urea and phenoxy acid herbicide data LOIS Core Programme

## Introduction
- LOIS rivers monitoring focuses on the occurrence, fate and flux transfer of micro-organics, prioritising Humber rivers to estuarine environments.
- Major study sites are industrial rivers (Aire, Calder, Trent, Don); Ouse monitored as a rural control.
- Part of LOIS core programme with background data for LOIS special topics.

## Summary of dataset
- Phenyl urea herbicide data for 12 Humber catchment sites (1994–1995 and 1994–1997) and 3 Tweed catchment sites (1995).
- Phenoxy acid herbicide data for:
  - S1, U3, N4, W5, O6: Dec 1994 – Sep 1995
  - S2, D7, A8, C9, D10, T11, O12: Dec 1994 – Feb 1997
  - TW13, TW14, TW15 (Tweed): Jan 1995 – Sep 1995

## Variables measured
- 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (ug/l)
- 4-(4-Chloro-O-tolyloxy) butyric acid (ug/l)
- 4-Chloro-O-tolyloxyacetic acid (ug/l)
- Chlorotoluron dissolved (ug/l)
- Diuron dissolved (ug/l)
- Isoproturon dissolved (ug/l)
- Linuron dissolved (ug/l)
- Mecoprop dissolved (ug/l)

## Where it was measured
- S1: Swale at Catterick Bridge (SE225994)
- S2: Swale at Thornton Manor (SE433715)
- U3: Ure at Boroughbridge (SE482561)
- N4: Nidd at Skip Bridge (SE482561)
- W5: Wharfe at Tadcaster (SE487435)
- O6: Ouse at Clifton Bridge (SE589528)
- D7: Derwent at Bubwith (SE706364)
- A8: Aire at Beal Bridge (SE534255)
- C9: Calder at Methley Bridge (SE409258)
- D10: Don at Sprotborough Bridge (SE538014)
- T11: Trent at Cromwell Lock (SE807612)
- O12: Ouse at Acaster Malbis (SE594445)
- TW13: Tweed at Boleside (NT498334)
- TW14: Tweed at Norham (NY898477)
- TW15: Tweed at Ormiston Mill (NT702280)

## When it was measured
- Attempts were made to sample weekly; interruptions occurred when processing was not possible.
- Linuron dissolved measured only from Apr 1994 to Oct 1994.

## How it was measured
- Samples collected in chromic acid-washed 1 L glass bottles.
- Phenyl urea herbicides: concentration via methods including Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) using C18 cartridges; alternative washes with methanol; or Liquid-Liquid Extraction (LLE) with dichloromethane.
- Phenoxy acid herbicides: concentrated using LLE (Method 3).
- Analyses:
  - Phenyl urea herbicides: High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV/VIS detection.
  - Phenoxy acid herbicides: Gas Chromatography (GC) with Mass Selective Detector (MSD).

## Quality control
- One sample from each batch randomly spiked with mixed standards of urea and acid herbicides.
- Certified standards (>99% purity) used for determinands.
- Wallingford laboratory participates in AQUACHECK inter-laboratory harmonisation for urea and acid herbicides.

## Data quality considerations
- Data quality varies due to highly polluted rivers producing complex chromatograms and values near detection limits.
- Difficulties in extraction, especially with emulsions in LLE.
- A zip file of box-and-whisker plots provided for each determinand to illustrate data quality (range, median, IQR, outliers).

## Data handling and accessibility
- Until Nov 1994, urea herbicides analyzed by York University and IFE Wareham; from Dec 1994, Wallingford IH handled extraction and analyses.
- Box-and-whisker plots and QA information accompany the dataset to aid user assessment.

## Personnel and timeline
- Early phase: York University and IFE Wareham (until Nov 1994).
- From Dec 1994: Wallingford IH (extraction and analyses).
