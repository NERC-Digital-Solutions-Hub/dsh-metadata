# Phenyl urea and phenoxy acid herbicide data LOIS Core Programme

- Introduction and aim
  - Addresses occurrence, fate and flux transfer of micro-organics in LOIS rivers, focusing on levels in Humber Rivers and transfer to the estuarine environment.
  - LOIS rivers programme emphasizes measurements in Humber catchment and provides background for specialized topics; Ouse monitored as rural control; major study sites along industrial rivers (Aire, Calder, Trent, Don) with Ouse as rural site.

- Data scope and timeline
  - Phenyl urea herbicide data: 12 sites in Humber catchment (1994–1995 and 1994–1997) and 3 sites on Tweed catchment (1995).
  - Phenoxy acid herbicide data: various site sets with specific time windows:
    - S1, U3, N4, W5, O6: Dec 1994 – Sep 1995
    - S2, D7, A8, C9, D10, T11, O12: Dec 1994 – Feb 1997
    - TW13, TW14, TW15: Jan 1995 – Sep 1995

- Variables and units
  - Phenyl urea herbicides: 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; 4-(4-Chloro-O-tolyloxy) butyric acid; 4-Chloro-O-tolyloxyacetic acid; Chlorotoluron (dissolved); Diuron (dissolved); Isoproturon (dissolved); Linuron (dissolved); Mecoprop (dissolved); all in micrograms per litre (ug/l).
  - Phenoxy acid herbicides: same general naming pattern and detection in ug/l; Linuron dissolved data noted separately in some sites.
  - For each site, measurements cover all variables listed for that site’s period (with Linuron dissolved data selectively present).

- Locations and sampling framework
  - Measurements taken at multiple river sites along Humber and Tweed catchments, identified by site codes (e.g., S1, S2, U3, N4, W5, O6, D7, A8, C9, D10, T11, O12, TW13, TW14, TW15) with corresponding NGR coordinates and river names.
  - Sampling intended to be weekly, with occasional pauses due to processing constraints.
  - Linuron dissolved measurements limited to specific intervals (April 1994–October 1994 for certain sites; excluded in some Tweed sites).

- Measurement and analytical methods
  - Sample collection: chromic acid-washed 1 L glass bottles.
  - Phenyl urea herbicides: concentration via solid phase extraction (SPE) using C18 cartridges, with multiple procedure variants; analysed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV/VIS detection.
  - Phenoxy acid herbicides: concentration via method 3 liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane; analysed by Gas Chromatography with Mass Selective Detection (GC-MS).
  - Method variants include additional cartridge washing steps to remove impurities before elution.

- Quality control and data quality
  - Quality control: random spike of one sample per batch with mixed standards; certified grade standards >99% purity used.
  - External quality assurance: Wallingford laboratory participates in WRC AQUACHECK inter-laboratory harmonisation for urea and acid herbicides.
  - Data quality notes: variable due to highly polluted sites (Aire, Calder, Don, Trent) leading to complex chromatograms; concentrations often near detection limits; extraction difficulties, especially with emulsions in liquid-liquid extraction.
  - Data products: box-and-whisker plots (zip file) for each determinand showing range, median, interquartile range, and outliers to aid user interpretation and assessment of data quality.

- Data provenance and personnel
  - Prior to November 1994: concentration of urea herbicides analysed by York University and IFE Wareham laboratories.
  - From December 1994 onward: samples analysed by Wallingford IH.
