# Data Support

## Aim
- To support others in exploring data and obtaining useful insights by finding, combining, analysing data, and creating data products for others to explore readily.
- They have data analysis and communication skills and support data use across a broader range of topics.
- They often work for organisations with less specialised remits, like local councils or private companies.

## Who they are
- They have data analysis and communication skills, supporting a broad range of topics rather than specialising deeply.
- They often work for less specialised organisations like local councils or private companies, supporting policy work and sometimes communicating data publicly.

## How they meet their aims
- They 'understand the ask', figuring out what is needed and why, and the best way to meet those needs.
- They find and verify sufficient data, potentially seeking help from topic experts.
- They quality assure, clean, and transform data into appropriate formats, combining datasets.
- They analyse patterns to identify significant features.
- They create products like dashboards or pivot tables to enable end users to 'self-serve', or create reports and charts, providing guidance on using these tools.
- They may promote their outputs and gather feedback to develop products further, potentially sharing early prototypes.
- They may advocate for better data creation.

## Particular Challenges
- Time spent 'understanding the ask' due to a lack of data consideration in wider teams.
- Working with 'patchy' data in a 'wide range of formats'.
- Accessing 'different systems' to find and access the data.
- 'Difficulty communicating complex information simply'.
- 'Promoting outputs' to ensure they are used. There were concerns that outputs are not being as widely shared and re-used as they could be.
