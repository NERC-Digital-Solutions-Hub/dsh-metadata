# Phenyl urea and phenoxy acid herbicide data LOIS Core Programme

## Overview
- LOIS rivers programme investigates occurrence, fate, and flux transfer of micro-organics in rivers, focusing on Humber rivers to the North Sea and using Tweed as a rural control.
- Primary aim: determine herbicide levels and flux into estuarine environments; provide background for broader LOIS topics; observe range and data for informing specialized research.

## Data coverage

- Time periods
  - Phenyl urea herbicides: Humber data for 1994–1995 and 1994–1997; Tweed data for 1995.
  - Phenoxy acid herbicides: Humber/Tweed data across late 1994–1995 to early/mid 1997 (varying site periods).
- Sites
  - Humber catchment: 12 sites (large industrial rivers Aire, Calder, Trent, Don; Ouse rural control, among others).
  - Tweed catchment: 3 sites (TW13, TW14, TW15) with varying measurement periods and exclusions.
- Variables/chemicals
  - Phenyl urea herbicides: 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 4-(4-Chloro-O-tolyloxy) butyric acid, 4-Chloro-O-tolyloxyacetic acid.
  - Phenoxy acid herbicides (dissolved): Chlorotoluron, Diuron, Isoproturon, Linuron, Mecoprop.
  - Units: micrograms per litre (ug/l) for all determinands.
- Location and period details
  - Site-by-site naming (e.g., S1, S2, U3, N4, W5, O6, D7, A8, C9, D10, T11, O12, TW13, TW14, TW15) with specific NGR coordinates and measurement windows.
- Sampling cadence
  - Intended weekly sampling; interruptions occurred due to processing limitations.
  - Linuron dissolved measured only in April–October 1994.
  
## Data collection and methods

- Sampling and containers
  - Samples collected in 1 L chromic acid-washed glass bottles.
- Concentration/enrichment methods
  - Phenyl urea herbicides: Solid phase extraction (SPE) using C18 cartridges; alternative elution schemes; liquid–liquid extraction with dichloromethane.
  - Phenoxy acid herbicides: Concentration primarily via liquid–liquid extraction (dichloromethane).
- Analytical methods
  - Phenyl urea herbicides: High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV/VIS detection.
  - Phenoxy acid herbicides: Gas Chromatography (GC) with Mass Selective Detector (MSD).
- Quality control and standards
  - One sample per batch spiked with mixed standards.
  - Use of certified standards (>99% purity).
  - Laboratory participation in AQUACHECK interlaboratory harmonisation for urea and acid herbicides.
  
## Data quality and limitations

- Data quality is variable due to:
  - High pollution in some sites leading to complex chromatograms.
  - Herbicide concentrations often near detection limits.
  - Extraction challenges, especially with liquid–liquid extraction forming emulsions.
- Data products
  - Zip file containing box-and-whisker plots for each determinand by site to illustrate ranges, medians, and outliers to aid assessment of data quality.

## Data provenance and governance

- Laboratories
  - Up to Nov 1994: York University and IFE Wareham for urea herbicides.
  - From Dec 1994: Wallingford IH for extraction and analyses.
- References and methodology
  - House et al. (1997) detailed methods for micro-organic compounds in Humber rivers.

## Data accessibility and structure

- Data packaging
  - Box-and-whisker plots zip file provided for each determinand and site, illustrating data ranges and quality.
- Documentation and quality context
  - Detailed site-by-site measurement metadata (codes, coordinates) and methodological descriptions accompany the dataset.
