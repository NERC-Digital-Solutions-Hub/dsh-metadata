- Keeping data up to date cited as a barrier to data sharing.
- Inadequate metadata hindering verification of data suitability.
- Data formats requiring effortful transformation to be usable.
- Deciding how to communicate complex findings clearly.
- Putting data governance processes in place to ensure standards, storage, sharing, and currency.
