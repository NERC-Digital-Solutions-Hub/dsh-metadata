# Phenyl urea and phenoxy acid herbicide data LOIS Core Programme

## Purpose and scope
- LOIS rivers program monitors micro-organics to understand occurrence, fate, and flux transfer to estuarine environments.
- Primary aim: determine herbicide levels in Humber River catchment and assess flux to the estuary; provide background data for LOIS special topics.
- Focuses on Humber rivers (industrial: Aire, Calder, Trent, Don; rural control: Ouse) with Tweed sites for comparison.

## Data coverage and variables
- Phenyl urea herbicides (e.g., 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; others listed) and phenoxy acid herbicides (list includes 4-(4-Chloro-O-tolyloxy) butyric acid, 4-Chloro-O-tolyloxyacetic acid, Chlorotoluron, Diuron, Isoproturon, Linuron, Mecoprop).
- Units: micrograms per litre (ug/l).
- Locations (selected examples): Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1), Swale at Thornton Manor (S2), Ure at Boroughbridge (U3), Nidd at Skip Bridge (N4), Wharfe at Tadcaster (W5), Ouse at Clifton Bridge (O6), Derwent at Bubwith (D7), Aire at Beal Bridge (A8), Calder at Methley Bridge (C9), Don at Sprotborough Bridge (D10), Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11), Ouse at Acaster Malbis (O12); Tweed at Boleside (TW13), Tweed at Norham (TW14), Tweed at Ormiston Mill (TW15).
- Periods:
  - Phenyl urea data: Humber sites 1994–1995 and 1994–1997; Tweed sites 1995.
  - Phenoxy acid data: various site sets from Dec 1994–Sept 1995 and Dec 1994–Feb 1997; Tweed sites Jan 1995–Sept 1995.
- Measurement scope: “All variables” at most sites; Linuron dissolved excluded at some Ouse/ Tweed sites (partial datasets).

## Temporal coverage and sampling details
- Sampling intended weekly; interruptions occurred due to processing constraints.
- Linuron dissolved measurements limited to Apr–Oct 1994 for some datasets.

## Sampling and analytical methods
- Sample collection: chromic acid-washed 1 litre glass bottles.
- Concentration methods for phenyl urea herbicides (three options):
  - Method 1: Solid phase extraction (SPE) with C18 cartridges; elute with ethyl acetate.
  - Method 2: SPE as Method 1 with additional methanol:water wash before elution.
  - Method 3: Liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane (used for phenoxy acids as well).
- Analysis:
  - Phenyl urea herbicides: High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV/VIS detector.
  - Phenoxy acid herbicides: Gas Chromatography (GC) with mass selective detector (GC-MS).
- Quality control: random sample spikes with mixed standards; certified purity >99% standards; participation in AQUACHECK interlaboratory harmonisation.

## Data quality and caveats
- Data quality varies due to:
  - High pollution in some rivers causing complex chromatograms.
  - Most analyte concentrations near detection limits.
  - Extraction challenges, especially liquid-liquid extraction with emulsions.
- Box-and-whisker plots (per determinand) available to illustrate data quality across sites.

## Data provenance and stewardship
- Who measured:
  - Until Nov 1994: urea herbicides by York University and IFE Wareham.
  - From Dec 1994: Wallingford Integrated Hydrology (IH) for extraction and analyses.
- Reference framework: House et al., 1997, Sci Total Environ. 194/495: 357–371.

## Use and interpretation
- Provides background data for LOIS rivers to support broader research into micro-organic pollutants in major UK rivers.
- Helpful for understanding spatial and temporal variability, and for informing more specialized LOIS topics and predictive modelling.

## Key limitations
- Gaps in temporal coverage due to sampling interruptions.
- Variability in data quality and detectability near limits, influenced by pollution levels and extraction challenges.
- Some compounds (e.g., Linuron) have incomplete or site-specific data.
