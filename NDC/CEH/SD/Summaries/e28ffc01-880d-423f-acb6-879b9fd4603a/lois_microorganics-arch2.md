# Phenyl urea and phenoxy acid herbicide data LOIS Core Programme

## Aim
- Describe occurrence, fate, and flux transfer of micro-organics in LOIS rivers, focusing on Humber rivers to assess pollution levels and potential transfer to estuarine environments.
- Provide background information for LOIS special topics programme and support standardized, comparable monitoring outputs over time.
- Emphasize measurements across Humber catchment (industrial rivers: Aire, Calder, Don, Trent; Ouse as rural control) and supplementary Tweed sites.

## What was measured
- Phenyl urea herbicides (e.g., 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and related compounds) and phenoxy acid herbicides (various tolyloxyacetates and related acids) with concentrations reported in micrograms per litre (µg/l).
- Specific determinations include: 2,4-D, 4-(4-Chloro-O-tolyloxy) butyric acid, 4-Chloro-O-tolyloxyacetic acid, Chlorotoluron (dissolved), Diuron (dissolved), Isoproturon (dissolved), Linuron (dissolved), Mecoprop (dissolved).

## Locations and times
- Humber catchment: 12 sites measured across 1994–1995 and 1994–1997.
- Tweed catchment: 3 sites measured in 1995.
- Site examples include Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1), Swale at Thornton Manor (S2), Ure at Boroughbridge (U3), Nidd at Skip Bridge (N4), Wharfe at Tadcaster (W5), Ouse at Clifton Bridge (O6), Derwent at Bubwith (D7), Aire at Beal Bridge (A8), Calder at Methley Bridge (C9), Don at Sprotborough Bridge (D10), Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11), Ouse at Acaster Malbis (O12), and Tweed sites TW13–TW15.

## When it was measured
- Sampling aimed for weekly intervals, with occasional interruptions due to processing constraints.
- Linuron dissolved measured only from April 1994 to October 1994.
- Data span: December 1994 through February 1997 for a subset of sites; additional years for Humber core sites.

## How it was measured
- Sample collection: chromic acid-washed 1 litre glass bottles.
- Concentration methods:
  - Phenyl urea herbicides: solid phase extraction (SPE) using C18 cartridges (with variations) or liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane.
  - Phenoxy acid herbicides: concentrated by method 3 (liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane).
- Analysis:
  - Phenyl urea: High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV/VIS detection.
  - Phenoxy acid: Gas Chromatography (GC) with Mass Selective Detector (MSD).

## Quality control
- One sample per batch randomly spiked with mixed standards for comparison.
- Certified standards used (purity >99%).
- Wallingford laboratory participates in AQUACHECK inter-laboratory harmonisation for urea and acid herbicides.

## Data quality
- Data quality is variable due to complex, heavily polluted matrices (Aire, Calder, Don, Trent) leading to complex chromatograms.
- Many determinations near detection limits; extraction challenges (notably in liquid-liquid extraction with emulsions).
- A zip file of box-and-whisker plots is provided for each determinand to illustrate data ranges (median, IQR, outliers) per site, aiding interpretation of data quality.

## Who measured it
- Urea herbicides: measured at York University and IFE Wareham until Nov 1994; from Dec 1994 onward, analyzed by Wallingford IH.

## Data management and access
- Data are organized for monitoring and made available with supporting quality plots to facilitate assessment and reuse.
- Emphasis on standardised methods and QA to enable consistent interpretation over time.
