# HUMBER CATHCMENT

- Overview
  - Indicates a focus on the Humber catchment area for environmental monitoring.

- Relevance to Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Aligns with standard monitoring responsibilities: use established data sources, verify and quality-assure data, and transform it for analysis.
  - Aims to produce clear outputs (reports, maps, charts) that reflect environmental health against standards.
  - Implicitly involves storing and uploading datasets to appropriate portals for accessibility.

- Typical Data Workflow (inferred)
  - Data verification and quality assurance on established sources.
  - Cleaning and transforming data to usable formats.
  - Analyzing against standardised environmental health criteria.
  - Generating outputs such as reports, maps, and charts.

- Data Management and Access
  - Emphasises the need to store created datasets and ensure they are available on relevant portals for broader access to underlying data.

- Key Challenges (aligned with archetype)
  - Increasing the value of Humber catchment datasets by integrating with other relevant data sources.
  - Enabling others to access the underlying data used to create final outputs.
