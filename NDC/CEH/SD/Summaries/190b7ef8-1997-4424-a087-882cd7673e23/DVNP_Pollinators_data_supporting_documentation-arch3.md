# Supporting documentation for dataset relating to Dorset Valuing Nature Project field component Pollinator abundance data

- Purpose: provide supporting data and methods for assessing pollinator abundance in relation to habitat condition as part of the Dorset Valuing Nature Project; links historical baseline data with contemporary habitat assessments to evaluate ecosystem service changes.
- Context: builds on Professor Ronald Good’s 1931–1939 botanical survey of Dorset; archive publicly available via the Dorset Environmental Records Centre (DERC).

## Experimental design

- Baseline: use Good’s 1930s habitat classifications as the starting point for site selection and gradient construction.
- Site selection: 13 calcareous grassland, 13 heathland, and 12 woodland sites chosen to span a condition gradient from degraded to preserved/restored states.
- Gradient construction: for each habitat, define a gradient from the original Good classification to current or target conditions (e.g., calcareous grassland to improved grassland, restoring calcareous grassland, SSSI-quality calcareous grassland; heathland to coniferous plantation or high-gorse/high heath; woodland to coniferous/broadleaf/ancient woodland with SSSI-quality references).
- Temporal and data integration: subsample and reclassify sites using multiple data sources (see Data sources and habitat gradient mapping) to identify current habitat types that correspond to the 1930s classifications.
- Outputs intended: a gradient framework enabling comparison of pollinator community responses across habitat condition categories.

## Collection methods

- Plot design: random assignment of 50m x 50m sample plots within the original Good survey area using ArcGIS.
- Survey timing: multiple visits conducted across 2017 and 2018.
- Pollinator sampling: two 50m transects per site; butterflies recorded to species within a 5m box; bees, hoverflies, flies, and beetles recorded to species within a 2m box along the transects; plant species foraging on recorded for each insect.
- Dates per habitat: calcareous grassland transects in June–August; heathland in May, August, September; woodland in May–July.
- Data captured: date, start/end times, weather conditions (cloud cover, temperature), and a fixed weather criterion set (dry, calm, min 13°C, up to 40% cloud, wind ≤ 5 on Beaufort; transects between 10:00 and 16:00).
- Data collection detail: note the exact surveyor, transect number, grid reference (10 km resolution), sunshine, and other environmental context; comprehensive species-level data where possible.

## Quality control and metadata

- Personnel consistency: data collected by experienced field ecologists; the same ecologists conducted all surveys to ensure consistency.
- Data integrity: field data checked for anomalies and recorded as collected; standardized data entry into a spreadsheet with clearly defined column headings and units.
- Metadata and data structure: includes a detailed lookup table mapping habitat classifications from 1940 to 2017 gradient categories (e.g., Calcareous grassland, Improved grassland, Restoring calcareous grassland, Ancient woodland, Broadleaf woodland, Coniferous plantation, etc.).
- Data governance: notes on data provenance, structure, and the intended use for cross-temporal analyses; emphasizes data sharing considerations and the need to maintain data quality and compatibility across time.

## Data sources and habitat gradient mapping

- Core historical and contemporary sources used to define gradients and validate habitat classifications:
  - Good, R. 1937. Dorset botanical survey (baseline habitat identifications).
  - Horsfall 1981. Observations on plant habitat change in North-East Dorset.
  - Natural England (2014). Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and historical monuments.
  - Natural England (2015). Priority Habitats Inventory (version 2.1).

- Contemporary data layers used for site reassignment and gradient definition:
  - UK Land Cover Map 2007.
  - Natural England Priority Habitats Inventory.
  - SSSI boundaries and status.
  - Dorset Heathland surveys (2000) and related habitat classifications.
  - Higher Level Stewardship schemes (as context for habitat management).
- Gradient table: explicit mappings from 1940 habitat categories to 2017 outcomes (e.g., Calcareous → Calcareous grassland (SSSI quality); Calcareous → Improved grassland; Heathland → Coniferous plantation; Heathland → Gorse high heathland; Woodland → Broadleaf or Coniferous plantation; Ancient woodland (SSSI quality); etc.).
