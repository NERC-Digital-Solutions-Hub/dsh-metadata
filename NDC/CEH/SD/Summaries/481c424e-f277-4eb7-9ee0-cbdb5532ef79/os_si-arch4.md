# Oxidative stress markers in banded mongooses at Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, 2017-2021

- Study scope: Dataset of oxidative state markers in banded mongooses from Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, collected 2017–2021.

- Data types and formats:
  - Red blood cell glutathione (GSH.csv)
  - Blood plasma malondialdehyde (MDA_plasma.csv)
  - Blood plasma protein carbonyls (PC.csv)
  - Red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity (SOD.csv)
  - Whole milk malondialdehyde (MDA_milk.csv)

- Additional metadata and spreadsheets:
  - MDA_milk_before_dilution, QUANTITY USED, MDA_milk_μM, etc. (MDA milk spreadsheet)
  - MDA_plasma details with duplicates for quality control (MDA plasma spreadsheet)
  - Protein carbonyls details and repeats (PC spreadsheet)
  - SOD details including lysate and RBC activity, repeats (SOD spreadsheet)
  - GSH details including duplicate measurements and repeat dilutions (GSH spreadsheet)

- Study location and period:
  - Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda (0°12'S, 29°54'E)
  - Data collection period: 2017–2021

- How data were collected:
  - Field procedures:
    - Individuals trapped every 3–6 months using box traps.
    - Anesthesia with isoflurane prior to blood collection.
    - Blood drawn from jugular vein (100–500 μl) into EDTA tubes.
    - Plasma separated by centrifugation and stored for MDA and PC analyses.
    - Red blood cells frozen for GSH and SOD analyses.
    - All samples snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C; analyses conducted within one year.
  - Assay methods:
    - MDA (plasma and milk): HPLC with fluorescence detection after reaction with thiobarbituric acid (TBA); external calibration with TEP; detailed reagent preparation and instrumental settings provided; milk and plasma samples processed separately with specific handling steps.
    - Protein carbonyls: DNPH derivatization, spectrophotometric readout at 370 nm; protein concentration normalization; modified protocol to fit sample limitations; within-plate and between-plate repeats captured.
    - SOD: Based on xanthine oxidase–generated superoxide radicals; measurement via plate reader; units defined as U/ml lysate; RBC and duplicate measurements with dilution factors noted.
    - Glutathione (GSH): DTNB (5,5′-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid) assay; RBCs diluted and deproteinized; measurement according to kit instructions; duplicates and re-runs tracked.
  - Data quality and processing:
    - Duplicates and repetition used for quality control (e.g., MDA plasma repeats, SOD repeats, etc.).
    - Flags for sample quality included in datasets: Bloody (hemolysis), Cloudy (turbidity), no. thaws, date processed, and processing notes.
    - Some samples unavailable for certain assays due to insufficient blood volume or capture gaps.

- Why the data were collected:
  - To measure oxidative state in banded mongooses in relation to maternal nutrition condition and reproductive biology.

- Roles and responsibilities:
  - Principal Investigator: Jonathan D. Blount (University of Exeter)
  - Co-investigator: Michael A. Cant (University of Exeter)
  - Postdoctoral researchers collecting and analyzing data: Magali Meniri, Faye J. Thompson, Harry H. Marshall

- Data completeness and limitations:
  - Sample sizes for markers vary by assay due to blood volume limits and capture opportunities.
  - Data are accompanied by extensive methodological and quality-control details to aid interpretation and cross-study comparability.
