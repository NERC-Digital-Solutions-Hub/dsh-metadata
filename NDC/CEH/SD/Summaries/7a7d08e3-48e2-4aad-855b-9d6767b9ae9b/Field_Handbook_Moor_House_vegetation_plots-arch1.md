# MOOR HOUSE VEGETATION RE-SURVEY 2008

- Purpose and scope
  - Record plant species presence and abundance in 2x2 m plots, capturing header information, plot description, vegetation height, species presence and (usually) cover, plus a plot photo.
  - Data collected digitally using Vegplots; plot photos stored weekly on the network.
- Location and data tools
  - Plot locations within the Troutbeck Catchment shown on a summary map accessible on tablets.
  - Integration between ArcMap plot maps and Vegplots software.
  - Data collected in two tablets per team; datasets labeled A or B to avoid overwriting when both tablets are used.
  - Data transfer and uploading procedures rely on USB and network paths.

- Data entry workflow (Vegplots)
  - Locate plot in ArcMap and start Vegplots Standard Recording screen.
  - Header fields auto-populate with plot identifiers (Transect, Plot Type U = 2x2 m, Plot Number, Plot ID).
  - Tabs include Headers, with sub-sections for data entry and validation.

- Header: plot description
  - Slope: Flat, Slight, Moderate, Steep
  - Aspect: None, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
  - Location type: Open moorland, eroding area, sloping grassland, gully, valley bottom grassland, industrial/man-made/other (Notes box)
  - Peat depth: depth in cm, measured after assessing vegetation
  - Photos taken? Yes/No (Photo protocol applied if Yes)

- Vegetation height
  - Estimate or measure height at three plot points (e.g., North Corner, South Corner, Plot Centre)
  - Height classes: 0–5 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–15 cm, 15–20 cm, 20–25 cm, 25–30 cm, 35–40 cm, 40 cm–1 m, >1 m

- Admin and Notes
  - Surveyors: initials with optional reuse via “Save Names”
  - Plot Completed? options: Complete, Complete with validation errors, Incomplete
  - Notes: free text (max 250 characters); date of survey and altitude GPS value

- Listed species and Selected species
  - Listed species organized into groups: Common species (up to ~100), Grasses, Sedges/Rushes, Ferns, Forbs/Woody species, Mosses/Lichens, Crops, and Unidentified species
  - If immediate ID isn’t possible, enter species A–C on Common species and D–Z on Unidentified Species; plots can be finalized with unidentified entries (flagged on validation)
  - Selected Species tab accumulates all identified species for the plot; enter estimated total cover for each species
  - Cover entry process: select 1% then choose 5% category; ensure consistency between partners to avoid over/under estimation
  - Overhanging canopies counted in normal fashion; avoid double counting over roots vs. canopies
  - Bare ground excludes leaf litter and rock
  - Bryophytes and lichens limited to listed taxa; mosses/lichens on rocks/trees ignored

- Completing plots and validation
  - Save frequently to protect against data loss
  - Validate to highlight missing fields (Header fields in red; Selected Species with missing data flagged)
  - After validation, Save and Exit; validation required before changing plots or exiting

- Plot photo protocol
  - Take new photos for each plot to aid relocation; photos should include reference points and plot number/type
  - Use weather writer labels on back of camera or paper to indicate plot features
  - Photos typically include one north-facing and one south-facing shot; avoid glare and excessive sky
  - Photos downloaded weekly to a specific network path: S:\ECOPRO\Moorhouse Veg Resurvey 2008\Completed Data\Plot Photos

- U plots (Unenclosed plots)
  - Plots are 2x2 m; layout with folding rules; poles oriented NS and EW
  - Header: no specific header information for U plots
  - Listed species recorded from the 2 m^2 quadrat using species lists or a BRC list on the right of the field
  - Cover recorded in 5% bands via the Selected Species tab
  - Aggregations/Combinations: certain taxa may be combined when difficult to separate; use combinational names when species cannot be unequivocally identified
  - Bryophytes and Lichens: only listed bryophytes/lichens recorded with their covers
  - Sphagnum taxa: specified green/thin and red/fat categories with explicit taxon lists

- Data protocols
  - Regular backups and frequent saving; use Backup Current Data feature
  - Paper plots transferred to tablet data entry promptly
  - Plot photos transferred weekly to the Plot Photos directory
  - Data transferred weekly from tablet to Field_data folder, with a dated folder (e.g., 150708) and a zip file sqcompleted_0001.zip created and copied to the USB stick
  - If two tablets were used, ensure data from each is distinguishable

- Equipment and field logistics
  - Comprehensive field kit including rucksack, food/water, PPE, weather gear, GPS, two digital cameras, 2x2 m quadrats, depth poles, folding rulers, sample bags, markers, weatherwriter, and vegetation guides
  - Tablet setup: two spare batteries per tablet, base charging unit, cables, harness/case, spare stylus, cleaning cloth
  - Connectivity: mobile phones and GPS devices with planned backup procedures for battery and reception

- General protocol (field workflow)
  - Turn on devices; check batteries and reception
  - Identify and locate geo-referenced coordinates using GPS and OS maps
  - Take north and south photos with compass guidance
  - Measure and record altitude, slope, aspect, and vegetation height
  - Orient the 2x2 m quadrat (North-South)
  - Conduct vegetation survey: record dominant species percent cover and presence/absence
  - Take additional photo from the south
  - Use the quadrat pole to measure peat depth to the nearest cm
  - Return to step 1

- Data storage and naming conventions
  - Photos stored under the Moorhouse Veg Resurvey 2008 directory structure
  - Field data stored in the Completed Data\Field_data folder, with date-based folder naming
  - Data transfer to USB follows the completion of a square’s data upload process to ensure traceability

- Appendices and equipment details
  - Appendix I: Field equipment list
  - Appendix II: General protocol and step-by-step workflow
  - Additional notes on equipment, tablet accessories, and contingency planning for field conditions
