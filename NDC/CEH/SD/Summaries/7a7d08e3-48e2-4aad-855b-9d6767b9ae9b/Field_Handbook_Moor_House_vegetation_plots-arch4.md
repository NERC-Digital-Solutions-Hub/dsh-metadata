# MOOR HOUSE VEGETATION RE-SURVEY 2008

- Field survey for recording plant species presence and abundance in 2x2 m plots within the Moor House area (Troutbeck Catchment), using digital tools (Vegplots) and ArcMap for data capture and plot localization.
- Aims to collect standardized header information, plot description, vegetation height, species lists (including unidentified taxa), and plot photos to support consistent analysis and data sharing.

## Data collection framework and tools

- Digital data capture with Vegplots, linked to an ArcMap plot map; photos downloaded weekly to a network folder.
- Teams use two tablets; dataset naming distinguishes A/B tablets (e.g., VegetationPlotsA.mdb).
- Data are uploaded and archived weekly via USB and a standardized zip process (Complete Square for Upload to Wiki), creating sqcompleted_0001.zip.
- Data management emphasizes backup, validation, and consistency across partners.

## Plot location, scope and workflow

- Plots are located within the Troutbeck Moorhouse survey area using ArcMap, GPS, and tablet GPS; precise plot locations are derived from map points, distances, and bearings.
- Both ArcMap and Vegplots are essential for plotting and data entry; movement and plotting should minimize disturbance to vegetation.

## Data entry workflow in Vegplots

- Start by selecting the plot in ArcMap, then open Vegplots for that plot (Standard Recording screen).
- Key identifiers pre-populated: Transect, Plot Type (U for 2x2 m), Plot Number, Plot ID, with Save/Validate/Exit controls.
- Data entry organized under headers: Headers, Species lists, and Selected Species.

## Plot header and field measurements

- Header information includes:
  - Plot description: slope (Flat, Slight, Moderate, Steep), aspect, location type, peat depth (cm), photos taken (Yes/No).
  - Vegetation height: estimate/measure at three points (north corner, south corner, plot centre) in defined height classes.
  - Admin: surveyor initials; plot completion status.
  - Notes: free text with date of survey and altitude from GPS.
  - Plot photos: mandatory for relocation; two photos (one north-facing, one south-facing) recommended.

## Vegetation height and environmental data

- Record vegetation height across three points to capture vertical structure.
- Peat depth measured with provided rods after assessing vegetation; depth recorded in cm.

## Listed species and Selected species workflow

- Listed species: species organized into groups (Common species, Grasses, Sedges/Rushes, Ferns, Forbs/Woody, Mosses/Lichens, Crops, Unidentified). Users can select multiple species per plot; if uncertain, record as A-C (common) or keep as D-Z (unidentified) for later lab identification.
- Selected Species: a running list of identified species with:
  - Estimated total cover entered using 1% and then 5% cover categories.
  - Avoid double counting overhanging canopy vs. rooted material; trees/shrubs overhanging plots recorded with their canopy cover.
  - Use the Delete function to remove erroneous rows; maintain cross-partner consistency to prevent bias in cover estimates.

## Completing plots and validation

- Regularly save data to prevent loss.
- Validate to highlight missing fields (red header fields; red exclamation marks for missing species data).
- After validation, save and exit; you must validate before changing plots or exiting.

## Plot photo protocol

- Take new photos for each plot with a clear reference to plot number and type.
- Use a weatherwriter/backing marker to indicate plot details; photos should show a stable reference point to aid relocation.
- Two photos are recommended: one facing north and one facing south; photos downloaded weekly.

## U plots (Unenclosed plots)

- U plots are also 2x2 m; no special header beyond standard plot data.
- All species are recorded from the 2x2 m quadrat; 5% cover bands used for the Selected Species tab.
- Aggregations/combinations are allowed for difficult identifications (e.g., Cardamine hirsuta/flexuosa) to maintain consistency with broader survey practice.
- Bryophytes and Lichens: only listed bryophytes/lichens are recorded with individual cover; other bryophytes/lichens are not recorded.
- Sphagnum taxonomy is simplified into green/thin and red/fat categories with a listed subset of species.

## Data protocols, quality control and governance

- Back up and save data frequently; close Vegplots and use Backup Current Data.
- Paper plots must be digitized; weekly transfer of plot photos and field data to the network/common repository.
- Data management includes clear naming, date-based folders, and versioning to distinguish multiple tablets.
- Data validation and error-checking are built into the workflow to ensure data completeness and consistency.

## Equipment and logistics

- Field gear: two tablets with Vegplots, GPS (Garmin), two digital cameras, weatherwriter labels, quadrats and poles, folding rulers, hand lenses, sample bags, pencils, and field guides.
- Support gear: rucksack, weather protection, first aid, communications (orange mobiles), transportation (2x4 vehicle).
- Power: spare batteries, base charging unit, cable, and charging provisions for tablets and devices.

## General field protocol and sequence

- Power on devices; verify reception and GPS readiness.
- Identify geo-referenced coordinates; set up grid, take north and south photos with compass reference.
- Record environmental variables on the tablet (altitude, slope, aspect, vegetation height).
- Orient 2x2 m quadrats (North-South alignment) and begin vegetation survey (percent cover and presence/absence).
- Record peat depth with a ranging pole; proceed to complete the vegetation survey.
- Regularly save data and follow the weekly data transfer schedule for photos and field data.

## Taxonomic and note guidance

- Preference for species-level identification where possible; otherwise, apply provided amalgamated taxa.
- Specific guidance provided for Sphagnum species and bryophyte/lichen recording restrictions.
- Overhanging canopy considerations and avoidance of double-counting are emphasized for consistency.

- The document integrates field protocols with digital data handling to support standardized, verifiable vegetation surveys suitable for data-sharing and future analyses.
