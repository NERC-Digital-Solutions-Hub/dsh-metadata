# MOOR HOUSE VEGETATION RE-SURVEY 2008

## Aim and scope
- Record plant species presence and abundance in 2x2 m plots.
- Collect standardized header data (plot number, location type, slope, aspect, peat depth, vegetation height) and species presence with cover.
- Use digital data capture (Vegplots) and photograph plots for reproducibility.
- Store and share data through established portals and weekly network uploads.

## Data capture tools and workflow
- Digital data capture with Vegplots software on tablets; plot photos saved to a network directory.
- Plot locations shown on an ArcMap map accessible on tablets; precise plotting via GPS, tablet GPS, distance, and bearing.
- Data entry sequence: locate plot in ArcMap → open Vegplots for the plot → complete and validate data → select next plot.
- Separate datasets for tablets labeled A or B to prevent overwriting when multiple tablets are used.

## Plot recording and header data
- Plot recording aims to disturb vegetation as little as possible while completing a full census.
- Header information collected:
  - Slope: Flat, Slight, Moderate, Steep
  - Aspect: None, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
  - Location type: Open moorland, eroding area, sloping grassland, gully, valley bottom grassland, industrial/other
  - Peat depth (cm) measured after assessing vegetation
  - Photos taken? Yes/No (with plot photo protocol considerations)

## Vegetation height
- Estimate or measure vegetation height at three points (e.g., North Corner, South Corner, Plot Centre).
- Height classes: 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-15 cm, 15-20 cm, 20-25 cm, 25-30 cm, 35-40 cm, 40 cm-1 m, >1 m

## Admin and notes
- Surveyor initials; ability to save names for quick entry.
- Plot completion status: Complete, Complete with validation errors, Incomplete.
- Notes: free text (max 250 chars); include date of survey and altitude from GPS.

## Listed species and selected species
- Lists organized by groups: Common species, Grasses, Sedges/Rushes, Ferns, Forbs/Woody species, Mosses/Lichens; unidentified species tab for later ID.
- Process:
  - Tap species to add to the growing plot species list; record estimated total cover using 1% then 5% intervals.
  - Use Delete Selected Rows as needed to adjust records.
  - Do not double count overhanging vs. rooted material; bare ground excludes leaf litter and rock.
  - Trees/shrubs over plot canopies count with normal cover.
  - Bryophytes/lichens limited to listed taxa; follow provided Mosses/Lichens lists.
- Unidentified species:
  - If ID is deferred, enter A-C on Common species and D-Z on Unidentified Species for later confirmation.
- Aggregations/combinations:
  - Some taxa are recorded as combinations when separation is unreliable (e.g., Cardamine hirsuta/flexuosa) to maintain consistency with other surveys.

## U plots (Unenclosed plots)
- Plots are 2x2 m; described with folding rules and orientation along north-south and east-west axes.
- Header: No specific header information for U plots.
- Listed species: All species recorded within the 2 m² quadrat; use standard 5% cover bands.

## Bryophytes, Lichens, and Sphagnum
- Only listed bryophytes and lichens are recorded with individual cover values.
- Sphagnum taxa are classified into Green/Thin and Red/Fat groups with detailed sub-taxa as per protocol.

## Data protocols and data management
- Regular backups and saves; use Backup Current Data and weekly transfers.
- Paper plot records must be digitized onto the tablet as soon as possible.
- Plot photos: weekly transfer to designated server folder (Plot Photos).
- Field data: weekly transfer from tablet to Completed Data folder, using a dated folder (e.g., 150708). If two tablets are used, records must be distinguishable.
- Data transfer method: Complete Square for Upload to Wiki creates a zip (sqcompleted_0001.zip) on USB; copy to dated folder.
- Emphasizes avoiding data loss through frequent saving and validation before exiting or changing plots.
- Equipment and field logistics are outlined to support consistent data capture across teams.

## Plot photo protocol
- Take new photos for each plot to aid re-location in future surveys.
- Photos should include a clear reference point (e.g., distinctive feature) and plot number/type.
- Two photos recommended: one facing north, one facing south; avoid glare and excessive sky.
- Photos downloaded weekly to the designated plot photos repository.

## U plot specifics and typing
- U plots are 2x2 m and laid out with North-South and East-West orientation.
- No special header fields for U plots beyond standard species recording.

## Aggregations, limitations, and taxonomic notes
- Aggregations are used where detailed ID is not possible; maintain consistency with the BRC list.
- Bryophytes and lichens are constrained to the specified taxa lists; additional bryophytes/lichens are not recorded.

## General protocol and equipment
- Comprehensive field protocol covering: location identification, GPS/tablet alignment, plot orientation, data entry steps, and image capture.
- Equipment checklist includes: tablets with Vegplots, GPS devices, cameras, measurement tools (quadrats, depth poles), weather writer, safety gear, and data transfer accessories.
- Ensures readiness for field operations and consistency in data collection across plots and teams.

## Outputs for analysts
- Standardized digital dataset of plot headers, vegetation height, and species cover per plot.
- Georeferenced plot locations with accompanying plot photos for reproducibility.
- Weekly data uploads to central data stores enabling longitudinal environmental health assessments and policy performance monitoring.
- Clear validation and quality-control steps to ensure data reliability for environment monitoring analyses.
