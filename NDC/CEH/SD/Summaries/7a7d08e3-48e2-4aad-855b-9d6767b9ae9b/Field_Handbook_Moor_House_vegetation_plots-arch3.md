# MOOR HOUSE VEGETATION RE-SURVEY 2008

## Overview and purpose
- Adapted field handbook for recording plant species presence and abundance in 2x2 m plots, using digital data capture to support environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Aims to deliver standardized, high-quality vegetation data (including plot descriptors, photos, and species data) to inform monitoring decisions and future analyses.

## Data collection framework and tools
- Primary data capture via Vegplots software on tablets, integrated with ArcMap GIS for plot locations.
- Digital photography used to document each plot location and provide relocation references.
- Data are organized into a structured header and species modules to ensure consistent entry and later analysis.

## Plot design and scope
- Standard plots: 2x2 m quadrats (including U plots for unencLOSED plots) with explicit orientation and layout rules.
- Header data for each plot includes: plot number, location type, slope, aspect, peat depth, vegetation height, altitude, and date.
- Vegetation height recorded at three points per plot; height classes defined for analysis.

## Field protocols and data entry
- Plot recording steps: locate plot in ArcMap, open Vegplots, record Plot ID, and complete the standard recording form with header and species data.
- Data entry validated via a “Validate” function; incomplete or inconsistent fields trigger red flags for remediation.
- Admin fields track surveyor initials and plot completion status; notes capture additional contextual information.

## Species recording approach
- Listed species are entered across several groups (Common species, Grasses, Sedges/Rushes, Ferns, Forbs/Woody species, Mosses/Lichens, Crops, Unidentified species).
- Selected Species tab lists all identified taxa with estimated total cover in 1% and 5% categories; delete option available for erroneous rows.
- Aggregations/Combinations: certain taxa are recorded as combinations when species-level identification is not reliable; otherwise, use specific species names.
- Bryophytes and lichens are restricted to the predefined list; Sphagnum taxa are detailed with a simple green/thin and red/fat classification.

## U plots and data scope
- U plots (unencLOSED) are also 2x2 m; all species within the quadrat are recorded with % cover in 5% bands.
- Emphasis on avoiding double counting (e.g., overhanging vs. rooted material) and excluding bare ground that is not leaf litter or rock.

## Data quality control and validation
- Regular saves and backups during fieldwork; data must be validated before exiting a plot.
- Validation highlights missing fields (red headers) and missing species data (red indicators); partners should reconcile estimates to reduce bias.
- Data integrity features include a Delete Selected Rows function and explicit prompts to validate before changing plots.

## Plot photo protocol
- Take two reference photos per plot (one facing north, one south) to aid relocation; images must clearly show plot number and type.
- Photos should avoid glare and excessive sky; photos are stored on a network drive and reviewed after capture.

## Data transfer, storage, and governance
- Weekly transfer of plot photos and field data from tablets to central network folders (with dated folder names for traceability).
- If two tablets are used, labeling (A/B) ensures data from each device is distinguishable; data can be uploaded to a wiki via a specific export process that creates a dated zip file.
- Emphasis on data backups, avoidance of data loss, and maintaining a clear data trail for governance and reproducibility.

## Equipment and logistics
- Comprehensive field toolkit: tablets with Vegplots, GPS devices, two cameras, 2x2 m quadrats, depth poles, measuring tools, weatherproof gear, and data/logistics supplies.
- Operational guidelines cover tablet power management, GPS coordination, and field safety considerations.

## Relevance for monitoring framework authors
- Demonstrates a end-to-end, GIS-integrated, digitally aided monitoring workflow from plot establishment to data delivery.
- Provides detailed metadata fields, standardized taxonomic recording, and explicit quality control steps essential for credible environmental health monitoring.
- Highlights practical data governance activities: regular backups, version control across devices, structured data uploads, and transparency through documentation and photos.
- Illustrates handling of data challenges (e.g., taxonomic ambiguity, data silos, and the need for consistent aggregation rules) relevant to building robust monitoring frameworks.
