# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- Purpose and context
  - Part of a detailed, multi-block soil-vegetation monitoring dataset at Sourhope (Rigg Foot).
  - Rich descriptions of soil horizons, chemical properties, and vegetation across blocks to support long-term monitoring and cross-site comparison.

- Soil profile description (Block 4)
  - Horizons and depths (summary):
    - LF: 0–1 cm – fibrous, moist, no mineral grains.
    - FH: 1–4 cm – fibrous, moist, abundant fine roots.
    - H: 4–8 cm – black, amorphous matrix, moist, weak blocky structure, abundant fine roots.
    - Ah: 8–29 cm – dark reddish-brown, sandy silt loam, friable, fine to very fine roots, many igneous stones.
    - Abg: 29–40 cm – pink-gray to brown mottled; coarse sandy silt loam; fine roots; numerous igneous stones.
    - B sg: 40–61 cm – brown with mottling; sandy silt loam; fine roots; numerous igneous stones.
    - C gx: 61–95 cm – reddish-brown/clay loam; distinct mottles; massive to platy structure; very abundant igneous stones.
  - Key features:
    - Organic-rich surface with shallow mineral transition; increasing density of igneous stones with depth.
    - Structure shifts from blocky to platy with depth; presence of gley/moisture-related features implied by colors and horizons.

  - Trends and implications:
    - Surface horizons are enriched in organic matter (high LOI) and nutrients, with a sharp decline in C and N with depth.
    - Exchangeable Ca dominates in surface horizons; exchangeable Na, K, Mg show block-level variability.
    - pH remains acidic to mildly acidic, with CaCl2 readings generally lower than pH H2O readings.
    - Moisture loss and LOI patterns indicate substantial organic matter and moisture-retention characteristics in upper horizons.

- Auger samples (Block 4)
  - Depth-integrated results across six auger samples (4A–4F) show:
    - %N around 0.5–0.6; %C around 6.8–8.0; C:N ratios 12.6–14.3.
    - Ca 1.0–5.1 meq/100 g; Mg 0.58–3.50; K 0.58–0.81; Na generally low.
    - %Moisture loss 4.3–5.2; LOI 4.1–17.96; pH(H2O) 4.45–4.93; pH(CaCl2) ~3.6–4.14.
  - Implication: reflects a gradient from organic-rich surface to mineral subsurface with variable nutrient status and acidity.

- Vegetation survey (Block 4)
  - Plot-level surveys (A–F within 4A) capture presence and totals of species; total species counts per plot vary, reflecting microhabitat and management effects.
  - Dominant vegetation types linked to soil conditions (organic-rich surface horizons, moisture regimes, and substrate-derived stone content).

- Ecotron and data governance (Block 4)
  - Ecotron site provides controlled-environment data linked to soil and vegetation measurements for integrated analyses.
  - Data are archived with horizon labels, plot codes, and block layouts; sample storage, metadata, and governance practices highlighted as essential for long-term monitoring and cross-site comparability.

- Data integration and monitoring implications
  - Monitoring framework implications evidenced by:
    - Clear, stratified experimental layout (blocks, plots, subplots) with randomized treatments to minimize confounding.
    - Standardized sampling protocols for vegetation (presence/absence with potential abundance inference) and soils (0–30 cm cores, horizon profiling, archived samples).
    - Multi-parameter environmental health metrics across biological and chemical domains (vegetation composition, soil C and N metrics, LOI, inorganic nutrients, pH, moisture indicators).
    - Use of horizon-level metadata (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and block/plot identifiers to support cross-site comparability.
    - Long-term data stewardship including archiving at appropriate temperatures (e.g., -80°C where applicable), metadata documentation, and cross-site collaboration (ECN, Micronet).
  - Key challenges and considerations:
    - Data coverage gaps: vegetation sampling limited to a subset of subplots in some blocks; some soil blocks show anomalous values requiring careful interpretation.
    - Metadata completeness and accessibility: consistent horizon labeling, plot coding, and archival practices are essential for data reuse and governance.
    - Data-sharing barriers: publicly releasing underlying datasets can be hindered by governance and metadata concerns; monitoring frameworks should embed data governance and sharing plans at source.
  - Policy-relevance and outputs
    - Demonstrates how integrated soil-vegetation monitoring can reveal soil-plant interactions, moisture regimes, and nutrient dynamics under managed treatments.
    - Cross-site connections (ECN, Micronet) illustrate the value of long-term, harmonized data for policy-relevant environmental change assessments.

- End-state and resources
  - The dataset provides a comprehensive, multi-domain baseline for long-term monitoring of soil biodiversity and vegetation under managed scenarios.
  - Appendices and block-level data offer detailed baseline measurements to support replication, cross-site comparisons, and longitudinal policy-relevant analyses.
