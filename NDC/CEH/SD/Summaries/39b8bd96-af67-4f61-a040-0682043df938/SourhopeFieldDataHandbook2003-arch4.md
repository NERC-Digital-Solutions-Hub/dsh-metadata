# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Presents detailed soil and vegetation data collected at Sourhope, focusing on Rigg Foot blocks 4 and 5, including soil profiles, chemical analyses, auger samples, vegetation surveys, and ECotron/Micronet involvement.
- Documents horizon-level soil descriptions (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.), depth ranges, and associated physical and chemical properties.
- Includes site details (altitude, slope, drainage), and Block-level metadata supporting long-term ecological and biodiversity analyses.
- Supports cross-site comparisons and integration with Environmental Change Network (ECN) and Micronet datasets.

## Block 4: Soil Profiles, Analyses, Auger Samples, and Vegetation
- Soil profile description: Rigg Foot, Block 4
  - Horizons and depths: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Key characteristics: increasingly weathered mineral content with fibrous/root-rich layers; surface horizons show fine fibrous roots; Abg and Bs horizons contain igneous stones (andesite) and varying textures.
- Soil analyses (Block 4 profile)
  - Horizons (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx) with Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), and pH(CaCl2).
  - Notable ranges: surface horizons show higher organic content and C, with pH H2O around 4.7–5.0 in surface horizons; CaMeq/100g generally low in deeper horizons; LOI values high in shallow horizons (e.g., substantial moisture loss in FH and H).
- Auger samples (Block 4): 4A–4F
  - Measured %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), and pH(CaCl2) across individual auger samples, illustrating horizon-to-horizon variability.
- Vegetation survey (Block 4)
  - Plot-level tallies show species composition across plots 4A–4F, with totals for multiple species groups; detailed species counts provided per subplot.
  - Indicates how vegetation distribution aligns with horizon and microtopographic differences within Block 4 plots.

## Block 5: Soil Profiles, Analyses, Auger Samples, and Vegetation
- Site details (Block 5)
  - Grid reference: NT8544019520; Altitude ~315 m; Slope ~5°; Soil drainage: Imperfect; Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying.
  - Rock type: Undifferentiated intermediate igneous andesite; Soil series: Sourhope, Bellshill.
- Soil profile description: Rigg Foot, Sourhope, Block 5
  - Horizons and depths: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Key characteristics: surface horizons with abundant fine roots; increasing clay content and mottling with depth; presence of igneous stones throughout; clear horizon boundaries.
- Soil analyses (Block 5 profile)
  - Horizons (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), and pH(CaCl2).
  - Notable ranges: surface horizons show relatively high C and N in Ah; pH H2O typically around 4.3–5.2, slightly lower in CaCl2; LOI and moisture loss substantial in upper horizons, decreasing with depth.
- Auger samples (Block 5)
  - Samples 5A–5F with percent N and C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH(H2O), and pH(CaCl2).
  - Demonstrates horizon-to-horizon and sample-to-sample variability in nutrient status and soil chemistry within Block 5.
- Vegetation survey (Block 5)
  - Plots 5A–5F with subplots and species totals; provides counts for multiple species groups per subplot.
  - Data illustrate how plant community composition relates to soil profile properties and microtopography in Block 5.

## ECOTRON Site
- ECOTRON soil site: soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT 1)
  - Wt: 6.089 mg; %N: 0.59; %C: 8.22; C:N: 13.83; Ca: 2.76 meq/100 g; Mg: 1.7 meq/100 g; pH(H2O): 4.79; pH(CaCl2): 3.82.
- ECOTRON vegetation survey
  - Plot-level presence/absence and counts for key taxa; supports long-term monitoring within the ECN framework.

## Data Governance and Long-Term Context
- Data are horizon- and plot-level with extensive metadata, enabling reproducibility and cross-site comparisons.
- The dataset supports integrated analyses of soil chemistry, carbon/nitrogen dynamics, moisture and LOI, and plant community composition over depth and space within Blocks 4 and 5.
- Involves baseline and auger sampling, with explicit horizon designations and depth ranges; includes ECOTRON integration and Micronet context for cross-site analyses.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates the value of multi-domain, horizon-resolved data for long-term biodiversity and soil function analyses.
- Highlights the need for standardized metadata, consistent horizon naming, and harmonized units to enable cross-block and cross-site interoperability.
- Emphasizes documenting provenance, sampling year(s), and deviations (e.g., variations in sampling within blocks) to ensure data quality and reusability.
- Suggests developing centralized data dictionaries and metadata schemas, and establishing data cataloging and versioning to support ongoing updates and cross-project reuse.
