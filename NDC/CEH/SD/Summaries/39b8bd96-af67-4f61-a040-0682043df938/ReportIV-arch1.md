# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme – Sourhope Site Report

## Introduction
- Four years into the Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focused on links between soil biodiversity and above-ground plant communities.
- Long-term botanical monitoring tracks above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity.
- Site management includes fencing to exclude grazing, a mowing regimen (≈6 cm height), and five plot-level treatments (nitrogen and/or lime fertilisation; insecticide) to study their effects on plant communities.
- Functional analysis uses CSR (competitive, stress-tolerant, ruderal) framework to interpret shifts in plant strategies under different treatments.
- Predictions: fertilised plots should show higher productivity; unfertilised plots may lose nutrients over time; diversity responses depend on disturbance and nutrient status.

## Methods (incorporating site activity)
- Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells used for sub-plots and research groups.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4).
- Site management: monthly mowing May–September to ~6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing; spring fertilisation with nitrogen and/or lime as scheduled.
- Data collection:
  - Weather: on-site automatic weather station since 1999.
  - Above-ground productivity: regular clipping (0.5 m² cell per sub-plot) before each mow; dry weight measurements since 1999.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998; extensive point analysis surveys in 2000, 2001, 2002 using a 100-hole grid; bryophyte identification improved in 2002.
  - Soil: pH measured at ~5 cm depth; moisture measured with theta probe in 2002; additional soil and biomass sampling as part of various projects.
  - Research activity: Phase I projects largely finished by 2002; Phase II fieldwork (including labelled CO2 experiments) conducted in 2002.

## Results

### 3.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2002: relatively low rainfall in April and September, with wetter periods in February, July, and late 2002 leading to above-average annual rainfall.
- Winter 2001/02 was unusually mild; higher mean temperatures compared with prior winters.

### 3.2 Above-ground biomass estimates
- Across treatments, a consistent hierarchy of biomass persisted, but mid-summer productivity declined in several treatments in 2002.
- Fertilised plots (especially Nitrogen & Lime) remained most productive; Control 2 plots were less productive than Control 1 in 2002.
- Overall, biomass in 2002 fell relative to 2001 by 13.7% (N&L) to 31.2% (Control 2); slope position affected productivity, with Block 5 experiencing larger declines than Block 1.
- Long-term trend (1999–2002): general increase in biomass across treatments when compared to the 1999 starting point, despite 2002 for some plots.

### 3.3 Interaction between soil pH, moisture and productivity
- Lime raised soil pH significantly (to near 7 in upper soil layers) in limed plots; nitrogen also raised pH but to a lesser extent; controls and insecticide plots remained near baseline pH.
- Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (r ≈ -0.68); drier, less acidic plots tended to be the limed/fertilised ones.
- Overall positive relationship between higher soil pH and biomass across all plots; within some treatments, this relationship weakened or reversed (notably in plots with both nitrogen and lime).
- When pooling all plots, higher pH generally associated with higher productivity, but treatment-specific patterns varied.

### 3.4 Point Analysis survey
- Species-hits differed by treatment in 2002: improved plots (fertilised) showed higher hits for Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots dominated by Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Bryophytes (mosses) increased across the site, accounting for increasing proportions of total hits, especially in unimproved plots.
- Litter hits (dead vegetation) increased in 2001–2002, with the Nitrogen & Lime plots showing the highest litter incidence.
- Shannon diversity indices rose post-2000 in several treatments but declined in Nitrogen & Lime plots by 2002 (−15% vs baseline); other treatments saw small increases to substantial increases (up to +29% in Insecticide plots).
- Point Analysis revealed three dominant functional groups (stress-tolerators S, competitive-stress-ruderal CSR, and SR/CSR) accounting for 69–95% of vascular plant hits per plot.
  - By 2002, C-S-R species dominated in Nitrogen & Lime plots; stress-tolerant species increased in unimproved plots; SR/CSR species declined in lime-containing and insecticide plots.
- PCA of 2002 data separated improved vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots formed a distinct cluster; some nitrogen-treated samples clustered with lime plots.
- Bryophytes became relatively more important in unimproved plots; some reductions in bryophyte hits in nitrogen- or lime-treated plots.

## Discussion

### 4.1 Mowing effect
- Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across nearly all treatments, suggesting a site-level factor (likely mowing regime) rather than a single treatment cause.
- Festuca rubra expanded, particularly in fertilised plots, linking to lime or combined N&L treatment.
- Widespread expansion of stress-tolerant species across treatments implies reduced disturbance (loss of grazing) favors these species.
- Bryophyte expansion (mosses) aligns with mowing height (~6 cm) and absence of grazing; moss proliferation tends to be moderated in more productive plots.

### 4.2 Fertilisation effect
- Nitrogen and/or lime consistently boost above-ground productivity; greatest gains in plots with both N and lime.
- Fertilised plots, especially with lime, reach higher soil pH (near 7) and may experience lower soil moisture, potentially leading to stress during dry periods.
- Higher pH and fertility favor competitive, faster-growing species (C-S-R) in N&L plots; lime alone also supports shifts but with different emphasis on community structure.
- In N-only plots, the response differed from lime-containing plots, suggesting pH and moisture interactions influence functional group dynamics.

### 4.3 Insecticide effect
- Evidence linking insecticide to plant diversity is indirect; reducing herbivory could benefit palatable species and enhance diversity under infertile conditions, but a direct causal link remains cautious due to data limitations.
- Observed increases in diversity in some insecticide-treated plots may reflect complex plant-herbivore interactions rather than a straightforward effect of reduced herbivory.

### 4.4 Trampling effect
- First-year data for C2 plots (in 2002) show marked productivity reductions, plausibly due to trampling during peak 13CO2 pulse experiments, rather than a treatment effect per se.

## Key takeaways
- Fertilisation (especially N+L) strongly increases productivity but can shift community composition toward competitive, high-pH-tolerant species and reduce bryophyte diversity in the short term.
- Mowing and grazing exclusion appear to favor stress-tolerant and bryophytic components, reducing certain grasses (Agrostis spp.) and increasing mosses.
- Soil pH, driven by lime, is a major driver of productivity and community structure, interacting with moisture and nutrient status.
- Diversity responses are treatment-specific: while some plots gain Shannon diversity (notably insecticide-treated), others (notably N+L) show declines relative to baseline.
- The Point Analysis and CSR framework reveal clear functional shifts: fertilised plots move toward competitive, high-nutrient strategies, while unfertilised plots favour stress-tolerant, ruderal strategies and bryophyte expansion.
