# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to provide broad monitoring context for detailed studies; baseline data from 1998 used to contextualize year-to-year changes.
  - 2001 site management affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change of Officer in Charge.

## Introduction (context and design)

- Purpose: Monitor a wide set of variables to contextualize specialist studies and enable cross-year comparisons.
- Methods: Broad monitoring across 1999–2001 with measurements including weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition; alignment with Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998).
- Data management: Regular collection and communication of data (Automatic Weather Station; site-specific measurements); protocol-driven sampling during 2001 under veterinary protocol due to FMD.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after a very wet previous year.
- Radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower than prior years.
- Average soil moisture content higher in 2001 compared with earlier years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass across the sampling period; peak biomass in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass markedly higher than 2000, likely due to personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- When normalised against the control (C1) within each year, nitrogen and/or lime treatments show stronger positive effects on biomass.
- Statistical findings: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Liming continued to raise surface soil pH (0–5 cm): October 2001 averages were 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raised soil pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed no significant change since baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 point-quadrat survey matched July 2000 protocol; high inter-surveyor consistency (no significant surveyor effect).
- Total plant “hits” in 2001 were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting denser sward, possibly from grazing stock removal in 1998.
- Species-specific shifts by treatment:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments (except remaining dominant in Control 1 and Limed plots).
  - Festuca species increased across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen (F. ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (F. rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) showed more species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis).
  - Untreated plots hosted more species associated with poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
- Diversity: unimproved plots contained 24 species; Nitrogen & Lime plots had 18 species, suggesting potential early diversification decline with strong improvements.
- Multivariate analysis: PCA separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; improved plots tended to show more extreme associations with Festuca rubra and related species.
- Biomass–species relationships: higher biomass correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; higher biomass associated with reduced relative abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
- Litter: increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicative of faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) tended to be more acidic, with greater representation of N and/or Lime plots in these columns.
- This spatial pattern suggests underlying site heterogeneity influencing pH and community composition beyond treatments.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass distribution showed outliers with low biomass scattered across plots; central plots generally exhibited higher biomass (e.g., N&L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass across plots.
- No significant differences in biomass attributable to block design (statistical ANOVA results).
