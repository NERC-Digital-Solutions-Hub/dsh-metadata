# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Documents long-term soil biodiversity data collection at Sourhope, focusing on Block 4 and Block 5 soil profiles, analyses, auger samples, vegetation surveys, and ECOTRON plots.
- Aims to support data governance, discovery, and reuse within soil biodiversity research networks (ECN, Micronet).

## Data Structure and Scope
- Hierarchical organization by blocks (Block 4, Block 5, ECOTRON) with horizon-level soil data and per-plot vegetation data.
- Block metadata includes site details (grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, rock type) and soil profile descriptions.
- Data linked via MLURI barcodes; physical soil samples archived separately (e.g., at CEH Merlewood).

## Data Types and Content
- Soil profiles (Block 4 and Block 5)
  - Horizon descriptions and depths (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with color, texture, structure, roots, and boundary types.
- Soil analyses
  - Horizon- and block-level measurements: weight, %N, %C, C:N ratio, cation chemistry (Ca, Na, K, Mg in meq/100g), %moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
- Auger samples
  - Similar chemical and physical properties across multiple auger depths (A–F subsamples) with corresponding moisture, LOI, pH, etc.
- Vegetation surveys
  - Plot- and subplot-level vegetation data (e.g., Block 4 plots 4A–4F; Block 5 plots 5A–5F) including species totals or counts per subplot.
  - ECOTRON vegetation data for contextual cross-site comparisons.
- ECOTRON data
  - Separate soil analyses and vegetation surveys for Ecotron plots within the Sourhope site.

## Metadata, Standards and Data Quality
- Consistent measurement units and descriptors (N, C, C:N ratios; meq/100g for Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %LOI; pH H2O and CaCl2).
- Site metadata includes precise grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, and parent material.
- Documentation notes data quirks and partial subplot sampling; horizon-level descriptions enable cross-site comparability.
- Provenance includes barcode IDs and horizon identifiers (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg).

## Data Management, Provenance and Storage
- Data organized as blocks > plots > subplots; horizon- and sample-level data linked to unique MLURI barcodes.
- Primary data hosted on MLURI servers; physical soil samples archived (-80°C) at CEH Merlewood.
- Sampling dates and methods are described in the handbook, enabling traceability and reproducibility.

## Data Governance, Reuse and Accessibility
- Integrated with Environmental Change Network (ECN) and Micronet initiatives to facilitate cross-site data sharing and long-term environmental monitoring.
- Structured to support ongoing updates across years for tracking environmental change and biodiversity trends.
- Detailed data dictionaries and appendices (e.g., block-by-block site details) enhance discoverability and interpretability.

## Data Quality and Challenges
- Some data gaps or anomalies noted (e.g., missing values in certain horizons or plots; variability across blocks).
- Challenges include harmonizing data from different blocks, systems, and sampling events; managing large, multi-format datasets; ensuring interoperability with external datasets.

## Block 4 and Block 5 Highlights
- Block 4 and Block 5 provide comprehensive horizon-level soil descriptions and chemical analyses across multiple horizons, including iron igneous stone content and soil mottling.
- Auger samples add depth-specific chemical and physical properties.
- Vegetation data per plot/subplot show species representation and totals, enabling assessment of biodiversity in relation to soil profiles and treatments.
- Block 5 includes site details and a deeper horizon sequence (C g, BC g) with corresponding chemical and physical metrics.

## Appendices and Data Catalog
- Appendix-style details embedded in the document include block-specific site details, soil profiles, horizon descriptions, and raw dataset structures to support data discovery, interpretation, and reuse.
