# SUMMARY

- Purpose and scope
  - Four-year report on the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders), focusing on aboveground productivity, species composition, and diversity in a managed grassland experiment.
  - Examines major management drivers: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and lime), and insecticide application, plus trampling effects, and their impacts on plant communities and functional types.

- Study design and site management
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site with 5 replicate blocks across a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
  - Treatments implemented in plots: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen + Lime, Insecticide (formerly Biocide). Treatments assigned randomly; site-wide mowing (about 6 cm) and insecticide application occur annually since 1999.
  - Data collection framework established in 1998–1999 and continued through 2002, with year-by-year updates to protocols and datasets (see Appendices for specifics).

- Key data collected (and data governance relevance)
  - Above-ground biomass: seasonal samplings (May–Sept) from 0.5 m2 cells; samples dried and weighed; used for longitudinal biomass trends and treatment comparisons.
  - Weather and climate: on-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999; includes rainfall, radiation, and temperature metrics.
  - Soil chemistry and moisture: soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe) measurements; linked to productivity dynamics.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline (1998) plus repeated point analysis surveys (2000–2002) using 0.5 m2 cells and 100-point grids; bryophyte and vascular plant identification refined over time.
  - Species and functional classification: data analyzed by functional groups (stress tolerators, competitive-stress-ruderal types) using CSR framework; PCA used to distinguish treatment groups based on species hits.
  - Datasets and appendices: extensive supplementary material (Appendices 1–8) detailing treatments, species lists, weather data, biomass by plot, rank analyses, and bryophyte dynamics.
  - Dataset scale: total soil samples collected since the start reaches 11,621; per-year data and multi-year time series enable longitudinal governance and audit trails.

- Major findings (2002 results, with context)
  - Biomass productivity
    - Long-term trend: overall increase in biomass across treatments since 1999, despite a 2002 drop relative to 2001; the strongest biomass gains occur in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.
    - 2002 specifics: biomass declined in many treatments; Block-level (slope position) effects observed, with lower productivity in higher blocks.
    - Fertilisation impact: nitrogen and/or lime generally boost productivity; plots with both N and Lime show the greatest gains, though signs of possible peak effects in highly limed plots (soil pH near 7.0) and potential moisture limitations.
  - Soil chemistry and productivity relationship
    - Lime raises soil pH significantly (approaching 7.0 in limed plots); nitrogen also increases pH slightly.
    - Positive relationship between higher soil pH and productivity is evident when considering all treatments, but the relationship becomes complex within treatments (especially where both N and Lime are applied).
    - Soil moisture shows a negative correlation with pH, suggesting drier conditions in more fertilised plots may influence productivity dynamics.
  - Plant functional composition and diversity
    - Mowing effect: widespread decline of Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis across treatments, suggesting mowing pressure and uniform sward height favor more competitive species such as Festuca rubra in fertilised plots; mosses/bryophytes expand under reduced disturbance.
    - In unimproved plots (unfertilised), stress-tolerant species gain prominence; in fertilised plots, competitive traits increase with improved growing conditions.
    - Bryophyte expansion is notable across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; moss hit rates increased from 6.5–10.8% to around 19.9% across 2000–2002.
    - Diversity indices: Shannon diversity shows treatment-driven differences emerging from 2000 and intensifying through 2002; N&L plots show reduced diversity by 2002 relative to baseline, while other treatments show smaller increases or stable/diversity gains.
    - Functional groups: across 2000–2002, SR/C-S-R and related groups dominate hits; C-S-R species expand notably in N+L plots; stress-tolerant species rise in unimproved plots.
  - Species composition and community structure
    - In 2002, northern grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) become relatively more abundant in fertilised plots; Agrostis spp. decline; bryophyte components remain a significant portion of total hits, especially in unimproved plots.
    - PCA and other multivariate analyses separate improved (fertilised) plots from unimproved ones, with limed plots clustering distinctly due to pH-related shifts in species composition.
  - Trampling effect
    - In 2002, C2 plots (introduced for sampling) show pronounced productivity reductions likely due to trampling during labelled 13CO2 pulses, highlighting potential confounding effects in short-term disturbance events.

- Implications for data stewardship and governance
  - Standardization and metadata
    - Clear, consistent protocols across years for mowing, fertilisation, insecticide application, and sampling must be documented and maintained to ensure cross-year comparability.
    - Appendices provide detailed treatment maps, application dates, and rates; these should be retained with versioned metadata to enable reproducibility.
  - Longitudinal data management
    - The study generates rich, multi-layer time-series data (biomass, soil chemistry, climate, species hits, functional-group classifications) across multiple plots and years; requires robust data versioning, provenance tracking, and data cataloguing to support discovery and reuse.
  - Data quality and gaps
    - The 2002 weather data period includes missing dates due to a station software outage; substitutions were made using a nearby station. Documenting such data gaps and substitutions is essential for transparent analyses.
  - Access and documentation
    - Extensive appendices (Appendices 1–8) document site activity, treatments, species lists, and datasets; these should be maintained and indexed in a data catalogue to support data discovery and re-use by researchers and data stewards.
  - Governance recommendations
    - Maintain a data dictionary linking treatments to plots, dates, and rates; ensure consistent unit usage and measurement methodologies; implement data version control and lineage tracking.
    - Preserve and provide access to all supporting documentation (site maps, treatment matrices, species lists, biomass tables, PCA/ANOVA outputs) to enable auditability and reproducibility of findings.

- Enduring considerations for data users
  - The dataset supports understanding how mowing, fertilisation, and soil chemistry interact to shape productivity and plant functional dynamics, including potential trade-offs between biodiversity and productivity.
  - The CSR-based functional classifications and the point-analysis biodiversity metrics offer a framework for comparing treatments and assessing ecological function over time.
  - Findings emphasize the importance of managing disturbance, nutrient inputs, and soil chemistry to balance biomass production with plant community diversity, including bryophyte dynamics.
