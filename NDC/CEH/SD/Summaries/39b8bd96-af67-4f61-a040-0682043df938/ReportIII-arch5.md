# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Intensive field study under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Aimed to provide broad context for other studies and enable year-to-year comparisons of site conditions, treatments, and biodiversity.
- Managed data collection across multiple measurements (weather, biomass, soil pH, plant species composition) with standardized protocols to facilitate cross-year integration.

## Data Collection and Datasets

- Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 weather data collected; annual rainfall near long-term average; slight temperature decrease; higher soil moisture than previous years.
  - Data regularly downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.

- Above-ground biomass
  - Harvested across treatments (including controls, nitrogen, lime, nitrogen+lime, biocide) with a consistent yearly hierarchy in biomass response.
  - Peak biomass typically in July/August; 2001 biomass higher than prior years, likely due to personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass data analyzed as ln-transformed in ANOVAs; significant treatment-year interactions; no significant block effects.

- Soil pH
  - Upper 5 cm soil pH measured; liming raised pH over time (6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in N&L plots by Oct 2001); nitrogen addition also raised pH modestly; controls largely unchanged since baseline (1998).

- Botanical composition
  - Point Quadrat method in July 2001 (mirroring 2000) for ~50% of quadrats per surveyor; cross-surveyor differences not significant.
  - 2001 total hits 58% higher than 2000, suggesting increasing sward density (possible grazing removal since 1998).
  - Clear treatment differences in dominant species; nitrogen and/or lime treatments favored Festuca and Poa pratensis; Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments; unimproved plots showed higher species diversity (24 species) than improved plots (18 species).
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) distinguished nitrogen/limed plots from control/biocide plots; biomass correlated with relative species abundances (e.g., Festuca rubra positively linked to biomass).

- Data documentation and standards
  - Protocols aligned with Baseline Data Survey (1998) and maintained consistency with 2000 procedures.
  - Species codes and treatment labels standardized (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris, N = Nitrogen, L = Lime, N&L = Nitrogen & Lime, etc.).
  - Appendix 1 provides annualised above-ground biomass per plot.

## Management and Context (2001)

- Site access restricted February–May 2001 due to Foot and Mouth Disease controls; subsequent activities resumed under a strict protocol.
- Change of site Officer in Charge after May 2001.
- Despite disruptions, core site management activities (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, point analysis) largely continued according to the 2001 Site Management Plan.
- First biocide application in May 2001 was missed; subsequent applications completed.

## Site Heterogeneity

- Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition across columns (spatial heterogeneity) noted, with more acidic plots in certain columns (E and F) possibly linked to treatment distribution.
- Biomass distribution showed outliers with lower biomass in several plots, and higher biomass in centrally located plots.
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant differences across blocks.

## Data Quality, Provenance, and Analysis

- Data quality supported by cross-checks in botanical surveys: high agreement between surveyors; method replication across years enhances comparability.
- Data analyses used:
  - ANOVA on biomass with log transformation to meet assumptions.
  - Principal Components Analysis to explore species assemblages and treatment effects.
  - Correlations between species abundance and biomass to interpret productivity drivers.
- Documentation includes detailed measurement dates, methods (e.g., mowing schedules, 0.5 m2 quadrats, 100-cell Point Quadrat grid), and species codes to enable reproducibility and reuse.

## Implications for Data Users

- Enables evaluation of treatment effects on productivity, soil chemistry, and biodiversity, with year-to-year context.
- Notable methodological shift in 2001 (manual to mechanical cutting) requires consideration when comparing biomass across years.
- Spatial heterogeneity suggests careful consideration of plot location and column effects in analyses.
- The dataset supports multivariate explorations (e.g., Taxa responses to N and/or lime, temporal biomass trends, and pH–biomass relationships).
- Availability of detailed metadata (treatment codes, plot/subplot structure, species list, and measurement protocols) facilitates data integration with other components of the Sourhope project.

## Appendices and Data Management

- Appendix 1 provides annualised above-ground biomass per plot.
- Tables and figures (e.g., Tables 1–6, Figures 1–9) document data collection schedules, treatment effects, pH changes, biomass trends, and species assemblages.
- Data management handled by the MLURI/Sourhope team with centralized weather data storage and cross-year comparison focus.
