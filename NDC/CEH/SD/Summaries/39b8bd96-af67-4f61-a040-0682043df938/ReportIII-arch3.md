# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive, multi-year field experiment at Sourhope to provide context for broader studies and enable cross-comparison of datasets.
  - A broad monitoring framework was prescribed at the outset to help linking with detailed studies and facilitate year-to-year comparisons.
  - The monitoring plan covers multiple data streams (weather, biomass, soil chemistry, vegetation composition) with a schedule designed to support cross-group analyses.

- Monitoring components and data streams
  - Automatic Weather Station: headline measures include rainfall, radiation, air and soil temperatures, soil moisture; data downloaded and managed centrally.
  - Above-ground biomass: regular biomass harvests across plots with five mowing events per summer; data normalized to a reference plot to identify treatment effects.
  - Soil pH: measurements in the top 5 cm; lime and nitrogen treatments tracked for pH changes over time.
  - Botanical composition: July 2001 Point Quadrat surveys to assess species abundance and community structure; cross-year comparability with 2000 survey; incorporation of a full species list and relative abundance (hits per species).
  - Site management and sampling schedule: explicit timetable for field activities, including mowing, surveys, and soil sampling; documentation of changes in site personnel and operational constraints.

- Key findings by measure
  - Weather (2001)
    - Rainfall near long-term average; minor reductions in average temperatures; slight increase in soil moisture compared with earlier years.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Clear treatment hierarchy: nitrogen and/or lime additions increase biomass relative to controls; peak production typically in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 2000 across treatments, likely due to staff changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Biomass differences persist after normalizing to a reference treatment (C1); significant effects of nitrogen and lime interactions over years.
  - Soil pH
    - Lime increases soil pH over time (e.g., limed plots ~6.19; N+L ~6.38 in October 2001).
    - Nitrogen alone raises pH to a lesser extent; control plots show little change since baseline (1998).
  - Botanical composition
    - 2001 survey shows higher total hits and shifts in species dominance compared with 2000.
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments; Festuca spp. increased, especially in fertilized plots.
    - Improved pasture species (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) more abundant in fertilized plots; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
    - Species diversity appeared to decline in the most improved plots (fewer distinct species under N and/or Lime).
    - Multivariate analysis (PCA) largely separates nitrogen/lime-treated plots from controls/biocide; biomass correlates positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis and negatively with several other species and bryophytes.
    - Increased litter in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, consistent with faster vegetation turnover at higher fertility.
    
- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
  - Spatial variability observed across the site (columns, slope direction); some columns exhibited more acidic conditions and distinct community composition under certain treatments.
  - Biomass distribution showed central plots generally higher; significant positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No strong differences in biomass between blocks; within-site heterogeneity acknowledged as an important factor in interpreting treatment effects.

- Management context and external factors
  - 2001 Foot-and-Mouth disease restrictions limited access to Sourhope for a period, with protocols implemented to maintain sampling within safety guidelines.
  - Change of site officer in 2001 (May) affected daily management and potentially data collection consistency; nevertheless, core management activities (liming, fertilization, pH monitoring, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) proceeded according to the 2001 Site Management Plan.
  - Despite disruptions, the study maintained a structured schedule and continued data collection across treatments.

- Data quality, analysis, and presentation
  - Data collected with standardized protocols; Table 1 outlines the main data collection events; Appendix 1 provides annual biomass totals.
  - Botanical surveys involved cross-checking between surveyors; no significant differences found, supporting data reliability.
  - Analyses included split-plot ANOVAs for biomass across years, PCA for community composition, and correlations between biomass and species abundances.
  - The results are presented with clear figures and tables to facilitate cross-year comparisons and linkage to other research within the programme.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates the value of a multi-metric monitoring suite (climate, productivity, soil chemistry, biodiversity) to capture interactions between soil fertility, plant communities, and productivity.
  - Highlights the importance of:
    - Consistent, documented protocols and metadata to enable cross-study integration and longitudinal analysis.
    - Contingency planning for field access and staff changes to maintain data continuity.
    - Accounting for site heterogeneity (spatial structure) when evaluating treatment effects.
  - External events (e.g., biosecurity restrictions) can affect data collection; monitoring frameworks should incorporate resilience and schedules that accommodate such shocks.
  - Data governance aspects (data management, accessibility, and transparency) are facilitated by centralized data managers and detailed documentation, aiding broader policy scrutiny and decision-making.
