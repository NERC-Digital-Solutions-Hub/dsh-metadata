- Documentation includes references to additional methodological materials (e.g., Twinspan, Association analyses) to support deeper data interpretation and cross-site comparisons.

## Key Takeaways for Analysis

- Soils at Rigg Foot show strong organic-rich upper horizons with high LOI and substantial C content, transitioning to mineral-rich deeper horizons with markedly lower LOI.
- Soils are acidic across horizons (pH typically between ~4.0 and ~5.0 in H2O; CaCl2 values generally lower), with base cation concentrations (Ca, Mg, K) highest in surface horizons and decreasing with depth.
- Depth-dependent changes in N, C, C:N, and LOI indicate pronounced stratification of organic matter and chemical weathering products, affecting nutrient availability and potential plant-soil interactions.
- Variability between Block 4 and Block 5 profiles (and within auger samples) highlights the influence of microtopography, horizon development, and parent material on soil chemistry and structure.
- ECOTRON plots provide a controlled context to link soil chemistry with vegetation responses and to compare with broader field data across the Sourhope site.
