# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Purpose
  - Document long-term soil and vegetation monitoring at Sourhope within the Soil Biodiversity Programme.
  - Emphasises standardized, secure data collection and storage to support environmental health assessments, time-series comparability, and broader data access beyond final outputs.

- Context and monitoring framework
  - Site part of UK Environment Change Network (ECN) and related long-term projects (SERAD Micronet), measuring soil, air and water quality, invertebrates, and plant diversity.
  - Data are designed to be validated, comparable across time/space, and openly accessible through appropriate portals.

- Experimental design and data scope
  - Five-block field layout with a structured hierarchy: blocks > main plots > subplots for project-specific treatments.
  - Treatments include controls, lime, nitrogen, N+lime, biocide, and fallow (reclassified as control where applicable).
  - Vegetation sampling via standardized point-quadrat method; soil sampling includes routine chemical analyses, soil moisture, loss on ignition, pH, and horizon-specific profiling.
  - Soil and vegetation data linked to climate history, land use, and management practices to explore soil-vegetation interactions under upland grassland conditions.

- Data management and accessibility
  - Managed by MLURI (Macaulay Institute) scientists; samples archived at CEH Merlewood.
  - Outputs intended for upload to established portals; appendix materials provide detailed, block- and plot-level data to enable independent verification and secondary analyses.

- Key data types and methods
  - Soil: 0–30 cm auger cores; horizon sampling (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.); analyses include %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g), %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH in H2O and CaCl2.
  - Vegetation: 50 × 50 cm quadrats; 25 points per sub-plot; species lists, dominance, and occurrence frequencies compiled into plot-, block-, and site-level tallies.
  - ECOTRON PLOT: separate controlled-environment subplot with dedicated soil analyses and vegetation surveys.
  - Data quality notes: some subplot sampling incomplete in certain years; block-level anomalies acknowledged; emphasis on integrating soil chemistry, vegetation composition, climate, and management history.

- Block 4 findings (Auger samples and vegetation)
  - Auger samples 4A–4F show:
    - %N ≈ 0.51–0.58; %C ≈ 6.80–8.02; C:N ≈ 12.6–14.3.
    - Ca ≈ 1.01–2.96 meq/100 g; Na ≈ 0.12–0.15; K ≈ 0.58–0.81; Mg ≈ 0.58–1.59 meq/100 g.
    - %Moisture loss ≈ 4.29–5.15; %LOI ≈ 14.6–17.96; pH H2O ≈ 4.45–4.82; pH CaCl2 ≈ 3.64–4.05.
  - Vegetation data (Block 4) show multispecies composition across plots 4A–4F with totals and presence/absence patterns; dominant taxa and indicator species align with upland grassland assemblages.

- Block 5 findings (Site details, soil profile, auger analyses, vegetation)
  - Site and profile
    - Site: Sourhope, Block 5; grid reference NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; Brown forest soil with gleying.
    - Soil profile across horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg (0–100 cm+), with horizon-specific chemistry and physical attributes.
  - Selected Block 5 soil data highlights (per horizon)
    - FH: %N ≈ 2.05; %C ≈ 33.81; C:N ≈ 16.46; Ca ≈ 11.91 meq/100 g; Mg ≈ 5.92 meq/100 g; %MOISTURE ≈ 8.16; LOI ≈ 67.00; pH H2O ≈ 4.66; pH CaCl2 ≈ 4.48.
    - Ah: %N ≈ 0.65; %C ≈ 9.36; C:N ≈ 14.36; Ca ≈ 2.38; Mg ≈ 1.52; %MOISTURE ≈ 5.42; LOI ≈ 19.27; pH H2O ≈ 4.34; pH CaCl2 ≈ 3.88.
    - AB and Bg horizons show declining C and N with depth, variable Ca, Mg, and very low Na; pH generally acidic (CaCl2 around 3.8–4.0 in deeper horizons).
    - BCg and Cg horizons: lower C and N, higher texture-related clay effects; moisture and LOI decrease with depth; pH around 4.7–4.9 in H2O, ~3.8–4.0 in CaCl2.
  - Auger analyses (5A–5F) provide horizon-specific means and ranges for: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2); indicating strong surface OM influence with high LOI at shallow horizons and progressively lower nutrients with depth.
  - Profile interpretation
    - Surface horizons (Ah/A B) show elevated organic matter and acidity, supporting plant and microbial activity patterns observed in vegetation surveys.
    - Deeper horizons reflect mineral soil development with lower nutrient contents, aligning with observed vegetation patterns and moisture regimes.
  - Vegetation (Block 5) data depict species totals and distribution across subplots, consistent with upland grassland communities and their response to soil conditions described above.
  - ECOTRON PLOT
    - Soil: %N ≈ 0.59; %C ≈ 8.22; C:N ≈ 13.83; Ca ≈ 2.76; Mg ≈ 1.7; %Moisture loss ≈ 4.79; LOI ≈ 17.42; pH H2O ≈ 4.79; pH CaCl2 ≈ 3.82.
    - Vegetation: separate site-specific survey data for ecotron subplot with species totals across Ac, Ao, At, Br, Fr, Gs, Ns, etc., reflecting controlled-environment conditions.

- Data usage and implications for environmental monitoring
  - Sourhope provides a richly documented, long-term dataset integrating standardized vegetation surveys, detailed soil chemistry across horizons, and explicit management treatments.
  - The standardized design enables robust temporal and spatial comparisons, aiding interpretation of nutrient amendments, liming, disturbance, and biocidal effects on upland grassland ecosystems.
  - Emphasis on data linkage (soil chemistry, vegetation, climate, management history) enhances environmental health assessments and policy evaluation.
  - Data quality considerations include occasional incomplete subplot sampling and block-level anomalies; open data access and appendices support verification and secondary analyses.
