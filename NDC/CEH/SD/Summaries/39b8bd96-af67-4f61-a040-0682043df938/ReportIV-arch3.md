# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders), the site has been monitored to track above-ground productivity, species composition and diversity in response to five management-related treatments and site-wide mowing.
- Core aim: understand how management practices influence soil biodiversity–above-ground plant communities and to inform monitoring approaches for policy and decision-making.

## Monitoring framework and site setup

- Location and design: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; plots subdivided into sub-plots for multiple research groups (0.5 m x 0.5 m cells used for repeated sampling; 16 projects funded across Phases I and II).
- Treatments (plot- and site-level): 
  - Site-level mowing (roughly 6 cm sward height, monthly May–Sept)
  - Plot-level inputs: Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide (Dursban)
  - Treatments implemented each year since 1999; data include detailed application dates and rates (N via NH4NO3; Lime as CaCO3; Insecticide post-mowing)
- Data collection disciplines:
  - Weather data from an on-site Automatic Weather Station (temperature, rainfall, radiation, moisture)
  - Above-ground productivity: seasonal biomass from a randomly selected 0.5 m2 cell per sub-plot
  - Botanical surveys: baseline (1998) and annual/periodic point analyses using a 0.5 m2 cell and 100-hole grid; bryophyte identification enhanced in 2002
  - Soil metrics: soil pH (5 cm depth), soil moisture (theta probe in 2002), and periodic other soil measurements
  - Group activity: research groups conducted additional sampling and tracer studies (e.g., 13CO2 pulses) in Phase II
- Data governance and sharing:
  - Outputs and data are disseminated to stakeholders; datasets linked to project PI’s and Soil Biodiversity website; metadata completeness and data sharing remain a focus given programme-wide openness standards.

## Key results and interpretation (2002 findings)

- Biomass productivity
  - A consistent hierarchy of biomass by treatment persisted; overall 2002 biomass was lower than 2001, but long-term biomass increased across all treatments since 1999.
  - Nitrogen and Lime together produced the highest above-ground biomass; Control 2 plots generally underperformed relative to early baseline plots.
  - A slope-related gradient: Block 1 (lower slope) showed larger relative biomass increases in earlier years; Block 5 (upper slope) showed stronger reductions in 2002.
  - Statistical confirmation: significant treatment effects and a significant Treatment x Year interaction (split-plot ANOVA).
- Soil chemistry and productivity linkage
  - Lime addition produced a pronounced rise in soil pH (toward ~7.0 in the upper soil profile); nitrogen had a smaller positive effect on pH.
  - A strong negative relationship between soil moisture and pH was observed; higher pH plots tended to be drier.
  - Across all treatments, there was a positive association between higher soil pH and productivity when considering all plots together, though this relationship varied within individual treatments (e.g., positive with N or Lime alone, but different with N&L).
- Plant community composition and functional types
  - Functional groups: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR) dominated the plots; these groups accounted for 69%–95% of live vascular plant hits per plot across surveys.
  - By 2002, nitrogen and lime treatments favored CSR (competitive, stress-sensitive) and reduced SR/CSR presence, while unimproved plots favored stress-tolerators.
  - Shifts among functional groups indicate that higher nutrient availability and disturbance regimes alter community strategy, with potential long-term reductions in diversity for fertilised plots and increases in stress-tolerant species for unfertilised plots.
- Species-level and diversity metrics (Point Analysis)
  - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) showed greater abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots maintained higher relative abundance of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Bryophyte abundance (mosses and liverworts) increased across the site, particularly in unimproved plots, and was less prevalent in nitrogen- or lime-treated plots.
  - Litter (dead vegetation) hits increased in later years, with nitrogen and lime treatments sustaining higher litter presence compared to controls.
  - Shannon diversity indices declined in nitrogen-and-lime plots from 1998 baseline, while other treatments showed smaller increases or stability, indicating a reduction in plant diversity under fertilisation.
  - PCA of the 2002 point data clearly separated improved vs unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots clustering together and some nitrogen-treated plots aligning with limed plots; species loadings highlighted fertile-indicator species (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, Trifolium repens) vs less fertile indicators (Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp., Luzula spp.).
- Insecticide effects
  - The insecticide (Dursban) plots did not yield straightforward, direct attribution of diversity changes; observed patterns align with classic herbivore-plant interaction literature, suggesting that reduced herbivory could allow more palatable species to persist under otherwise infertile conditions, potentially maintaining higher diversity, but direct causality remains cautious without deeper mechanistic data.
- Trampling and experimental activity
  - Introduction of trampling in C2 plots (first monitored in 2002) likely contributed to observed declines in productivity in those plots, particularly during peak 13CO2 pulse campaigns.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks

- Management drives biodiversity responses
  - Fertilisation (N and Lime) markedly enhances productivity but shifts functional composition toward competitive species, with potential to reduce diversity over time.
  - Removal of grazing disturbance (via mowing) fosters stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities; disturbance regime strongly shapes species composition and moss expansion.
- Data collection strategy alignment
  - Longitudinal, multi-metric monitoring (biomass, species hits, bryophyte surveys, soil pH/moisture, and PCA-based analyses) provides a robust framework to detect regime shifts and functional changes.
  - The combination of point analysis, biomass sampling, and soil chemistry offers a multi-dimensional view of how above-ground plant communities respond to below-ground processes and management.
- Data quality and metadata considerations
  - 2002 weather station data gaps required substitutions (Konza data) for some periods, illustrating the need for verifiable metadata and alternative data streams to maintain continuous time series.
  - The project demonstrates the value and challenges of sharing underlying data across research groups, while maintaining data integrity and provenance.
- Relevance to monitoring governance
  - The findings underscore the importance of setting data standards at source (e.g., consistent pH measurement depth, consistent sampling areas, well-documented treatment dates and rates) to enable data integration and governance across agencies.
  - The study illustrates how monitoring frameworks can inform policy by linking management practices to ecosystem responses, and by using functional classifications (CSR framework) to interpret responses.

## Notable data gaps and considerations for future monitoring

- Data gaps occurred due to weather-station issues in 2002, highlighting the need for redundancy and cross-site data sharing to maintain continuous records.
- While biomass and point analyses provide strong signals, linking specific causal mechanisms (e.g., herbivory intensity vs diversity) requires deeper, targeted experiments or controlled manipulations.
- The long-term trajectory of fertilised plots suggests careful monitoring of soil nutrient balance and moisture to anticipate potential productivity declines or stress responses as soils shift toward higher pH and altered water availability.
- Cross-year integration of bryophyte dynamics and their contribution to overall biomass should continue, given their rising importance under reduced disturbance and shifting nutrient regimes.
