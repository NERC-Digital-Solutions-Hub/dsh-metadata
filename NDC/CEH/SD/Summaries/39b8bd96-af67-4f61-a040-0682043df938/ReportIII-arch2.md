# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The Sourhope field experiment is part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at Sourhope Farm in the Scottish Borders to provide a broad monitoring context for detailed studies.
- A baseline data survey was completed in 1998; the project emphasises consistent context, year-to-year comparability, and standardised reporting across study groups.
- The year 2001 was affected by two external events: a UK Foot and Mouth Disease-related site restriction (Feb–May) and a change of site Officer in Charge in May 2001. Management activities and most measurements proceeded under a revised 2001 Site Management Plan, with one biocide application missed.

## 2. RESULTS

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data were generally unremarkable compared with prior years.
- Rainfall in 2001 (839 mm) was near the long-term average (2000 had higher rainfall at 1209 mm).
- Total annual radiation was similar to previous years; mean temperatures were slightly lower; soil moisture content was somewhat higher than in previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Across treatments, a clear hierarchy of biomass production persisted, with peak biomass typically in July or August.
- 2001 showed a substantial increase in biomass estimates versus 2000, likely due to a combination of personnel change and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- When normalised against the control (C1) within each year, nitrogen and lime (N/L) additions had the strongest positive impact on biomass; the combination N and Lime yielded the most pronounced effect.
- Statistical analyses (split-plot ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass) indicated:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots.
  - A significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.
  
### 2.3 Soil pH
- Surface soil (0–5 cm) pH increased with lime addition:
  - Limed plots averaged pH 6.19 in October 2001.
  - Nitrogen plus Lime plots averaged pH 6.38 in October 2001.
- Control plots showed little change since baseline (August 1998); nitrogen-alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis recorded 58% more total hits than July 2000, suggesting denser sward, potentially from earlier grazing exclusion (1998).
- Species composition showed clear treatment-associated shifts:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, persisting mainly in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; were most frequent in N and Biocide plots (F. ovina) and N and Lime plots (F. rubra).
  - Improved pastures species (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more apparent in fertilised plots, especially those with both Nitrogen and Lime.
  - Diversity was higher in unimproved plots (24 species in Control and Biocide) than in the Nitrogen & Lime plots (18 species), suggesting potential declines in diversity with stronger fertility treatment.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the 2001 survey largely separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots were more uniform and associated with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Biomass correlation with species:
  - Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundances positively correlated with biomass.
  - Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus), and others tended to decline as biomass increased.
- Litter and vegetation turnover increased in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster turnover with higher soil fertility.

## 3. SITE HETEROGENEITY

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F tended to have more acidic plots, a pattern likely influenced by the high proportion of unimproved or Biocide-treated plots in those columns.
- Underlying heterogeneity across the site is evident in the lower pH measures associated with nitrogen- and/or lime-improved plots in those columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass values varied across plots, with outliers typically showing lower biomass across treatments, and higher biomass generally associated with centrally located plots (e.g., certain Nitrogen, Lime, Biocide plots).
- A strong positive correlation existed between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass were detected between blocks.

## Methods and Monitoring (Key Points)

- Data collection framework and timing:
  - Baseline data from 1998; ongoing measurements through 1999–2001.
  - Main survey methods included:
    - Above-ground biomass: five mowing events per summer, 0.5 m² subplots, drying and weighing; data summed annually and ln-transformed for analyses.
    - Botanical composition: July Point Quadrat surveys (100-cell grid; 25 pins per cell); species coded and tallied as “hits.”
    - Soil: sampling of upper 5 cm for pH; lime and nitrogen treatments monitored for pH changes.
    - Weather: Automatic Weather Station data downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
- Data management and analysis:
  - Use of Genstat 5 for ANOVA and PCA.
  - Split-plot ANOVA to assess treatment, year, and their interaction.
  - PCA to explore associations among plots and treatments based on the botanical survey.
- Data outputs:
  - Clear figures and tables (e.g., biomass time series, pH changes, PCA plots, species abundance tables) to support cross-year comparisons and links to other project data.
  - Data and summaries are prepared to facilitate portal upload and sharing with other research groups.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring

- The Sourhope dataset demonstrates how standardised, multi-parameter monitoring (biomass, soil chemistry, plant community composition, and weather) supports year-to-year comparisons and the assessment of management practices (e.g., liming and nitrogen fertilisation) on ecosystem attributes.
- Management disruptions (e.g., FMD-related restrictions) and staff changes can influence measurement consistency, underscoring the need for transparent documentation of site conditions and procedural changes.
- The observed biomass responses and species shifts highlight the strong coupling between soil fertility management and above-ground productivity, with potential implications for forage quality and biodiversity under different nutrient regimens.
- Spatial heterogeneity is a notable factor in field experiments, affecting biomass distribution and soil chemistry; monitoring designs should account for such variability in analyses and interpretation.

Appendix notes (highlights)
- Detailed measurement schedules, species codes, and statistical results are provided (Tables 1–6; Figures 1–9) to support reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
- The dataset includes comprehensive observations across the 1999–2001 period, enabling integration with broader soil biodiversity and ecosystem monitoring efforts.
