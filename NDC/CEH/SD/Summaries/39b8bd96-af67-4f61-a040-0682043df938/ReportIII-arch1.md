# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive field study at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Aimed to provide context for detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons across a wide range of measurements.
  - 2001 management events affected activities: UK Foot and Mouth restrictions limited site visits (Feb–May 2001) and an officer change occurred in May 2001.

- Key datasets and measurements (results highlighted)
  - Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - 2001 weather near long-term averages after a very wet preceding year.
    - Rainfall ~ average; radiation similar; slightly lower average temperatures; soil moisture modestly higher than previous years.
  - Above-ground biomass (1999–2001)
    - Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass production; peak biomass in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass substantially higher than earlier years, likely due to staff changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Biomass normalized to a control (C1) to examine treatments; nitrogen and lime additions most consistently boosted biomass; nitrogen+lime gave strongest effect.
    - ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass showed significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
  - Soil pH (0–5 cm)
    - Liming raised pH steadily (e.g., ~6.19 in limed plots; ~6.38 in N+L plots by Oct 2001).
    - Nitrogen alone also increased pH, but less than lime; controls largely unchanged since 1998 baseline.
  - Botanical composition (Point Quadrat surveys, July 2001)
    - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in N+L plots, suggesting reduced diversity with improved fertility.
    - Shifts in relative abundance: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis more common in fertilised plots; Agrostis capillaris decreased across treatments.
    - Improved plots showed more species associated with improved pastures; control/biocide plots retained species linked to poorer pastures (e.g., Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
    - Principal Components Analysis separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; correlations between species abundance and biomass highlighted: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis linked to higher biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes linked to lower biomass.
    - A notable increase in overall “hits” (density) in 2001, consistent with a denser sward following reduced grazing and higher productivity.

- Site heterogeneity
  - Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) showed more acidic conditions, partly due to treatment allocation (more Controls/Biocide in those columns).
  - Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass patterns showed conspicuous spatial clustering: higher biomass in more central plots (e.g., some N+L and Biocide plots).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass observed.
    - No significant differences in biomass between blocks overall.

- Methods and data quality (supporting notes)
  - Field protocols
    - Monthly above-ground biomass via five mowing passages per summer on fixed sub-plots; 0.5 m2 sampling cells per plot; later summation and ln-transform for analysis.
    - July 2001 botanical survey used Point Quadrat frame (100 cells per cell, 25 pins touched per cell) with two surveyors to assess consistency.
    - Supplementary vegetation surveys around minirhizotron tubes and disturbance/nutrient plots conducted in Aug 2001.
  - Data analysis
    - ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass to test treatment effects; year-by-treatment interactions examined.
    - PCA used to explore species assemblages and treatment relationships.
    - Biomass estimates and species hits correlated to examine links between community composition and productivity.
  - Data quality checks
    - No significant difference between surveyors in 2001 Point Quadrat results (NS); data quality deemed robust for cross-year comparisons.
  - Data management and availability
    - Weather data downloaded automatically; data managed by MLURI and shared through relevant data portals with metadata.

- Notable external factors and management impacts
  - February–May 2001: Government restrictions due to FMD limited site access; enforced sampling under a protocol; first biocide application in May 2001 missed.
  - May 2001: Officer in Charge changed; potential influence on site management and sampling continuity.
  - Despite disruptions, key management activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, Point Analysis) largely proceeded under the 2001 Site Management Plan.

- Implications and takeaways
  - Fertility management (nitrogen and lime) enhances above-ground biomass and shifts plant communities toward species associated with improved pastures; however, this is accompanied by reduced plant species diversity in the most improved plots.
  - Soil pH is a strong mediator of productivity; liming raises pH substantially, aligning with higher biomass in treated plots.
  - Site heterogeneity is an important factor; spatial variation in pH and biomass suggests local context greatly influences treatment outcomes.
  - Data indicate a coherent link between community composition (species hits) and productivity, with PCA and correlation analyses supporting the treatment-driven trajectories toward fertilised/limed assemblages.
