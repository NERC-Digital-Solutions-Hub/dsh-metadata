# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

- A multi-block soil and vegetation data record from the Sourhope field site, focusing on Rigg Foot blocks 4 and 5, with ECOTRON plots included. Data support soil-vegetation analyses, baseline characterization, data quality assurance, and long-term monitoring within ECN-related projects.

## Data structure and key variables

- Horizon/level labeling and depth ranges:
  - Block 4: LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx; depths from 0 cm to 95 cm.
  - Block 5: LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; depths from 0 cm to 100 cm.
  - ECOTRON PLOT: horizon data for comparable analysis.
- Measured soil properties (per horizon or auger sample):
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio
  - Exchangeable cations: Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g)
  - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI)
  - pH (H2O), pH (CaCl2)
  - Sample weights (Wt, mg) for laboratory analyses
- Soil description and structure notes:
  - Descriptions of color (matrix color), texture (e.g., sandy silt loam, clay loam), mottling, structure (blocky, granular), root presence, stones, boundary types
- Vegetation data structure (per block/plot):
  - Subplots and plot-level species presence totals (e.g., Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, etc.)
  - Species totals by subplot/plot
  - Indication of dominant/indicator species across plots

## Block 4 data summary (Rigg Foot, Block 4)

- Soil profile description by horizon (0–95 cm) shows a progression from fibrous, root-rich upper horizons (LF, FH) to organic-rich Ah and AB horizons, and into mineral horizons (Bg, Cx/ Cgx) with varying color and texture.
- Laboratory measurements (per horizon):
  - Increasing %N and %C in surface horizons with notable C:N ratios around 12–20 across horizons
  - Exchangeable Ca generally higher in near-surface horizons, with Mg and K present in measurable amounts
  - %Moisture loss and LOI high in surface horizons, decreasing with depth
  - pH values mostly acidic to slightly acidic (H2O and CaCl2)
- Auger samples (Block 4) provide per-sample measurements for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2)
- Vegetation survey (Block 4) records plot- and subplot-level species presence totals, enabling identification of community composition and potential indicator species

## Block 5 data summary (Rigg Foot, Block 5)

- Soil profile (LF to Cg, 0–100 cm) with horizon-specific descriptions:
  - Upper horizons (LF, FH, H) show fibrous to semi-fibrous textures, abundant roots
  - Ah and AB horizons: dark, sandy to coarse-silty textures with frequent roots
  - Bg and BCg horizons: reddish-brown to greyish textures with mottling and abundant igneous stones
  - Cg horizon: lighter color, clay loam textures, massive or blocky structures
- Laboratory measurements (per horizon):
  - %N and %C values reflecting soil organic matter distribution, C:N ratios generally in the mid-teens
  - Ca, Mg, K, Na concentrations with notable Mg and Ca in near-surface horizons
  - %Moisture loss and LOI indicating organic matter content declines with depth
  - pH values show acidity to neutral ranges in deeper horizons
- Auger samples (Block 5 auger samples 5A–5F) provide detailed per-sample metrics for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2)
- Vegetation survey (Block 5) documents species totals per plot and per subplot, illustrating community composition and richness across the block

## ECOTRON soil site data

- ECOTRON PLOT soil analysis:
  - Wt (mg), %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O), pH CaCl2
  - Values indicate controlled-environment comparisons relative to field plots
- ECOTRON vegetation survey:
  - Species presence totals by plot and subplot, enabling comparison with field blocks and assessment of ecosystem responses under controlled conditions

## Data management, provenance, and long-term value

- Data capture and archiving:
  - MLURI-based data collection with unique MLURI barcodes for each horizon and sample (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; 4A–4F; 5A–5F; ECOTRON sample 1)
  - Soil samples archived for long-term storage; compatibility with ECN/long-term environmental monitoring
- Storage and accessibility:
  - Data linked to MLURI servers and accessible for ongoing analysis; supports cross-site comparisons and time-series analyses
- Reuse and interoperability:
  - Standardized horizon labeling, measurement units, and soil metrics facilitate integration with ECN datasets and cross-site studies
- Usability for data support:
  - Rich per-horizon chemistry tables, per-plot species lists, and horizon-level descriptors support dashboards, self-serve analytics, and data-driven decision-making for policy or land-management contexts

## Key considerations for data support

- Data breadth and provenance:
  - Integration of ecological (vegetation) and edaphic (soil) datasets across multiple blocks and plots, with detailed horizon-level metadata
- Data quality and gaps:
  - Occasional anomalous measurements and incomplete sampling in some blocks; Na values and some horizon data gaps noted; metadata essential for reproducibility
- End-user usability:
  - Outputs (soil chemistry tables, horizon profiles, vegetation species lists, and community classifications) are suitable for dashboards, filtering by block/plot/horizon, and self-service exploration
- Reuse context and long-term value:
  - The dataset provides baseline soil-vegetation relationships, supports cross-site comparisons, and underpins long-term environmental change analyses within ECN frameworks
- Documentation needs:
  - Clear metadata, horizon labeling conventions, and sample provenance to maximize reusability and cross-study comparability
