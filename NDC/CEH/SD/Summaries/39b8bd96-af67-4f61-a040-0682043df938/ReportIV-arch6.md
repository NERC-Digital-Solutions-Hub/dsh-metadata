# SUMMARY

- This document reports four years of data and analyses from the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on how above-ground plant productivity and botanical composition respond to managed treatments in a long-term field experiment.

## Overview of the study and design

- Location: Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute farm, Scottish Borders.
- Duration: 1998–2002 monitoring with intensive botanical and productivity measurements.
- Experimental design:
  - 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
  - Each block contains 6 main plots with randomized treatments.
  - Each main plot subdivided into 10 sub-plots; a 0.5 m × 0.5 m cell system assigns plots to research groups.
  - Treatments include: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), and Insecticide (Dursban 4).
  - Site-wide mowing of vegetation to ~6 cm was performed monthly May–Sept; insecticide applied after each mowing on insecticide plots.
  - Fertiliser applications (N and/or lime) occurred in spring across designated plots.
- Core focus: monitoring above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and relative abundance (diversity), and relating these to management-driven soil and plant functional changes.

## Data collected and formats

- Weather and site conditions
  - On-site Automatic Weather Station data since Feb 1999 (rainfall, radiation, air and soil temperatures, soil moisture).
  - 2002 data include notes on missing periods due to a weather-station malfunction (and use of nearby Konza station data during gaps).
- Above-ground biomass (productivity)
  - Regular biomass sampling from a randomly chosen 0.5 m2 cell within sub-plots S, T, U, V of every plot prior to each mow.
  - Samples oven-dried and weighed; data collected annually (1999–2002) across all treatments.
  - Appendix 6 provides annual biomass per plot and block means; general trend shows higher productivity in fertilised plots (N and/or lime) with the strongest effect when both are applied.
- Plant community surveys
  - Baseline survey in 1998; subsequent point analysis surveys in 2000, 2001, and 2002.
  - Point analysis uses a 0.5 m2 cell within sub-plots with a 100-hole grid; species at each pin-drop recorded.
  - 2002 survey expanded bryophyte identification to species level.
  - Appendix 3 contains a full species list; Appendix 8 shows ranked species abundance data across treatments.
- Soil and site measurements
  - Soil pH (H2O) measured at ~5 cm depth regularly since 1998; 2002 measurements repeated in plot centers and within point-analysis cells.
  - Soil moisture measured in 2002 via theta probe at corners of point-analysis cells.
  - Bryophyte incidence and distribution tracked via point analyses; systematic surveys track litter and other substrate components.
- Data products and analyses
  - Biomass data summarized by treatment, year, and mowing event; used for split-plot ANOVA.
  - Point-analysis data analyzed with PCA to separate improved vs unimproved plots; functional group analyses (CSR framework) classify species as stress-tolerators (S), competitive (C), and ruderals (R) and their combinations (SR, CSR, SR/CSR).
  - Shannon diversity indices calculated to assess changes in plant diversity over time (1998–2002).
  - Appendix 7 provides rankings for above-ground biomass; Appendix 5 provides weather-related series; Appendix 4 summarizes site activity.

## Key findings and patterns

- Mowing and disturbance
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across most treatments, suggesting a site-level response to mowing regime rather than a single-treatment effect.
  - Festuca rubra increased notably in fertilised plots; mosses (bryophytes) expanded across the site, particularly in unimproved plots, potentially linked to mowing height (~6 cm) and absence of grazing.
  - Moss expansion appeared mitigated somewhat in higher-productive (fertilised) plots due to greater vascular plant competition.
- Fertilisation effect
  - Long-term positive effect of N and/or lime on above-ground biomass; plots receiving both N and lime achieved the highest productivity.
  - Some signs that productivity may peak in the highest-fertility plots, potentially due to very high soil pH (near 7.0) and reduced soil moisture.
  - Elevated pH (from lime) and moisture interplay influence biomass; in plots with both N and lime, the positive relation between pH and biomass weakens or reverses, suggesting a nuanced, treatment-specific response.
  - CSR functional-group shifts: with N and lime, there is a move from stress-tolerant (S) toward more competitive (C) species; SR/C-S-R groups decline somewhat in these plots.
- Insecticide effect
  - Evidence for a potential link between reduced herbivory and increased diversity is discussed but remains tentative; literature suggests insecticide effects vary with life history of plants and timing.
  - The observed patterns may reflect a broader change in palatable species under a more infertile environment, with diversity remaining relatively high as long as conditions stay infertile.
- Trampling and plot-specific disturbances
  - A notable productivity drop in C2 plots in 2002 is attributed to trampling during intense sampling activity associated with 13CO2 pulses rather than a treatment effect.
- Diversity and functional groups
  - Shannon diversity indices show treatment-related divergence since 2000; 2002 data indicate a 15% diversity decrease in N&L plots versus increases in several other treatments.
  - PCA of point-analysis data clearly separates improved (fertilised) vs unimproved plots; certain nitrogen-treated samples cluster with limed plots, indicating convergent vegetation characteristics under some treatments.
  - Bryophytes (mosses) increasingly contribute to total hits and biomass, especially in unimproved plots; vascular dominance gradually shifts in some fertilised plots.
- Overall productivity trends
  - Across 1999–2002, biomass productivity rose relative to baseline but fell in 2002 for several plots; the strongest long-term gains occur in plots with N and lime together, though variability exists by block and slope position.

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations for use

- Data gaps
  - 2002 weather data included a period of missing measurements due to hardware failure; cross-checked with Konza station data for July–November periods.
  - 2002 C2 plots experienced trampling-related productivity declines during pulse-labeling work.
- Complex, multi-factor design
  - Clear year-by-treatment interactions emphasize the need to consider both time and management interactions when using the dataset for cross-year comparisons.
- Data richness and accessibility
  - Extensive appendices (species lists, site map, annual biomass by plot, biomass by block, weather data, point-analysis results) provide opportunities for re-analysis or integration with other datasets.
  - Datasets are available via the Soil Biodiversity project resources (website and CEH contact).

## Implications for data use and further work

- The data enable cross-year, cross-treatment analyses of productivity and plant community dynamics, with explicit links to soil chemistry (pH) and moisture.
- The CSR-based functional grouping approach offers a framework for interpreting shifts in community structure under different management regimes.
- The compiled datasets support exploration of relationships between above-ground responses and below-ground biodiversity within the broader Soil Biodiversity Programme.
- Users should account for notable 2002 data gaps and C2 trampling events when conducting longitudinal analyses.
