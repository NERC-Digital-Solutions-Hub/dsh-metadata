# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

- Overview
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) to understand soil biodiversity and the functional roles of soil organisms, and how above-ground plant communities respond to soil biodiversity management.
  - The programme combines below-ground biological focus with links to above-ground plant communities, monitored through productivity, species composition, and diversity.

- Site and Experimental Design
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
  - Each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m2 cells used for data collection.
  - Five site/plot-level management tasks since 1999: monthly mowing to ~6 cm; insecticide application (Dursban 4 OPA) to designated plots; nitrogen and/or lime amendments to fertilised plots; treatment plots designated as Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime, and Insecticide.

- Data Collection and Monitoring (Methods)
  - Weather: On-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999; key climate data (rainfall, temperature, etc.).
  - Above-ground productivity: A 0.5 m2 cell per sub-plot sampled prior to each mow; plants clipped, dried, and weighed.
  - Plant surveys: Baseline in 1998; subsequent botanical point analyses in 2000, 2001, 2002 using 100-point quadrats to track species hits (vascular plants and bryophytes).
  - Soil: Regular soil pH measurements (5 cm depth) since 1998; soil moisture measured in 2002; additional soil and bryophyte surveys; 11,621 soil samples collected by 2002.
  - Data and outputs: Multiple appendices with site maps, treatment summaries, species lists, weather data, biomass data, PCA analyses, and biodiversity indices.

- Key Findings (2002 Focus)
  - Biomass and productivity
    - Overall biomass productivity remained higher in fertilised plots, especially where nitrogen and lime were both applied, though signs suggest potential saturation or stress in the most fertilised plots (soil pH near 7.0; reduced soil moisture under high fertilisation).
    - 2002 saw a drop in biomass in several treatments relative to 2001, with the most pronounced declines in the Control 2 plots; slope position also affected productivity (lower blocks on the slope showed larger declines).
  - Mowing and disturbance
    - Regular mowing (approx. 6 cm) likely reduced Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across treatments, favoring Festuca rubra in more fertilised plots.
    - Stress-tolerant species expanded across most treatments, suggesting a general reduction in disturbance (grazing removal) and possibly nutrient enrichment driving shifts.
    - Bryophytes expanded across the site, particularly in unimproved plots, potentially aided by the maintained sward height and absence of grazing.
  - Fertilisation effects
    - Nitrogen and lime increased productivity, with the strongest response when combined (N+L). Excess lime raised soil pH toward 7.0; this, along with higher soil moisture loss in some plots, could limit further biomass gains.
  - Insecticide effects
    - Shannon diversity was highest in insecticide-treated plots in some years; however, the evidence for direct causation is cautious, as insect herbivory and plant responses are complex. Possible indirect benefits include increased palatable species able to persist under controlled herbivory.
  - Trampling effects
    - The C2 plots (notably used for labelled 13CO2 pulses) showed depressed productivity, likely due to trampling during intensive sampling events.
  - Plant functional groups (CSR framework)
    - Shifts toward competitive (C) and stress-tolerant (S) species in fertilised plots; stress-tolerant species prominent in unfertilised plots.
    - SR/CSR (stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderal) and related combinations varied by treatment; lime and insecticide treatments tended to reduce SR/CSR dominance relative to nitrogen-only or unfertilised treatments.
  - Diversity and community structure
    - Shannon diversity indices increased over time in many treatments, but declined in the nitrogen+lime plots by 2002; other treatments showed stability or gains.
    - Point analyses showed clearer differentiation between improved (fertilised, limed) and unimproved plots; a notable rise in bryophyte hits (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and others) in several treatments.
    - PCA of point analysis data revealed grouping by treatment, with lime-treated plots clustering together; nitrogen-treated plots sometimes clustering near limed plots, reflecting nutrient and pH influences.
  - Species composition changes
    - Dominant grasses remained Agrostis capillaris and Festuca spp.; however, Festuca rubra increased in fertile plots, while Festuca ovina declined in some years.
    - Bryophyte representation rose across treatments, particularly in unimproved plots; some vascular species associated with improved pastures (e.g., Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra) became more frequent in fertilised plots.

- Functional and Ecological Implications
  - Mowing and reduced disturbance favor stress-tolerant and moss-dominated communities, with potential long-term reductions in some grassland species richness.
  - Fertilisation boosts productivity but may reduce diversity and shift community structure toward fast-growing, high-nutrient-demanding taxa; potential risks for long-term resilience under climate variability.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but not definitively causal; herbivore interactions may contribute to maintaining diversity under certain nutrient regimes.
  - Soil pH and moisture are key drivers of productivity and community composition; lime-driven pH increases can alter plant functional dynamics and water status impacts.

- Data Quality, Access, and Next Steps
  - Extensive, standardized data collection across multiple years and plots; ongoing datasets include biomass, species hits, soil pH, and weather data.
  - Large dataset maintained (thousands of samples, years of observations) with appendices detailing treatments, species lists, and analysis results.
  - Findings support continued monitoring of functional group shifts, diversity trends, and biomass responses to management changes, with attention to long-term soil nutrient cycling, moisture balance, and pH effects.
  - Data accessibility for policy and wider research use highlighted by the structured reporting and comprehensive appendices.
