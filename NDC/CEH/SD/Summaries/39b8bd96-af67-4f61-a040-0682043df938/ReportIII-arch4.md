# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - A large, long-running field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to provide broad context for detailed studies and enable cross-study and year-to-year comparisons.
  - Data collected annually across multiple measurement domains: weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition; site heterogeneity also analyzed.
  - Two notable 2001 management events: Foot and Mouth Disease–related access restrictions and a change of site officer; a switch from manual mowing to mechanical shears occurred in 2001.

- Data assets and measurement methods
  - Automatic Weather Station: 1999–2001 headline weather data (rainfall, radiation, air/soil temperatures, soil moisture); data downloaded and managed centrally.
  - Above-ground biomass: monitored on a set of plots with five mowing events per summer; biomass per plot summed and log-transformed for ANOVA; results normalized to a reference plot (C1) to compare years and treatments.
  - Soil pH: measurements of the upper 5 cm; baseline August 1998; October 2001 pH values reported for different treatments (limed, nitrogen, lime, nitrogen+lime, biocide, control).
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys conducted in July 2000 and July 2001; 100 cells per quad, with 25 cells sampled per plot; species hits tallied and analyzed; inter-surveyor consistency tested.
  - Site heterogeneity: evaluation of spatial variation in pH, biomass, and community composition across site columns and blocks.

- Key results by data category
  - Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather metrics were generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after a very wet previous year; slight decline in average temperatures; soil moisture modestly higher than in prior years.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - A clear treatment hierarchy persisted across the sampling period; peak biomass typically in July/Aug.
    - 2001 biomass was substantially higher than 2000, attributed to personnel changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - When normalised to C1, nitrogen and lime consistently promoted biomass; ANOVA showed significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots and a significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
  - Soil pH
    - Liming raised surface pH (about 6.19 in limed plots; about 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots by October 2001).
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent; control plots remained close to baseline.
  - Botanical composition
    - 2001 surveys yielded 58% more total species 'hits' than 2000, suggesting greater sward density (likely due to reduced grazing since 1998).
    - Treatment effects: Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased across treatments; improved plots (N and/or L) showed higher abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
    - Species diversity: unimproved plots contained 24 species, while nitrogen+lime plots had 18, suggesting a potential decrease in diversity with stronger fertilization/liming.
    - Multivariate analyses (PCA) separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; biomass increase correlated with higher frequencies of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while certain others (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) declined as biomass rose.
    - Increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots indicated faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
- Site heterogeneity
  - Spatial variation observed: columns E and F exhibited comparatively more acidic plots than others, with underlying heterogeneity across the site.
  - Biomass varied by location, with central plots (e.g., certain nitrogen and lime plots) tending to show higher biomass.
  - A strong positive correlation existed between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences across blocks were detected.
- Data quality, governance, and caveats
  - Access restrictions in 2001 due to FMD required revised sampling protocols and vet oversight; first biocide application in May 2001 was missed but remaining management activities proceeded as planned.
  - Change of site officer could affect consistency of site management, though most core procedures were maintained.
  - Inter-surveyor comparison for botanical surveys showed no significant differences, supporting data reliability.
  - Data handling included normalization (to C1), log transformations for biomass, and MDC/ANOVA approaches to assess treatment and year effects.

- Implications for Data Leaders
  - Importance of consistent data collection protocols across years; when protocol changes occur (e.g., mowing method), document and normalize to maintain comparability.
  - Metadata should capture operational disruptions (biosecurity restrictions, staff changes) that can influence measurements and interpretation.
  - Spatial and temporal heterogeneity is significant; data systems should support geospatial tagging and site-wide stratification (columns, blocks) to analyze spatial patterns.
  - Data curation needs to accommodate multi-domain datasets (weather, biomass, soil chemistry, plant community) with integrated analyses (ANOVA, PCA) to reveal treatment effects.
  - Clear data standards, discoverability, and robust metadata are essential for enabling cross-study comparisons and long-term data reuse.

- Conclusion
  - The Sourhope field experiment demonstrates that nitrogen addition and lime application influence biomass production, soil chemistry (pH), and plant community structure, with notable year-to-year and spatial variation.
  - The 2001 data show increased biomass linked to management changes and chemical treatments, accompanied by shifts in species composition and turnover rates.
  - These findings underscore the value of well-documented, longitudinal, multi-faceted data systems for informing data strategy and governance in complex ecological research.
