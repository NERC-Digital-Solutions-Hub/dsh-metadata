# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- National field methodology to produce time-series data on land-use, vegetation, and landscape across GB.
- Aims to deliver standardized, comparable data for policy, biodiversity, and land-management indicators.
- Emphasizes baseline establishment, change detection, and compatibility with satellite imagery and remote sensing.

## Data Architecture, Standards, and Governance
- Data collection is structured around standardized forms and notebooks (FABs) to ensure consistency across teams and years.
- Multiple data streams are integrated, including vegetation plots, boundaries, physiography, and land-cover features; data are linked via parcel numbers to codes on data forms.
- Clear data handling rules govern publishing, relocation of plots, and updating of features; emphasis on metadata, discoverability, and traceability.
- Procedures for permissions, access, UK-wide coverage, and cross-agency collaboration (e.g., ITE, IFE) are embedded in the workflow.

## Sampling Programs

- Soil sampling
  - Conducted in 1 km squares with five replicate samples per square (from the same squares used in historical surveys).
  - In each X-plot, three soil cores are collected: two short (for fauna and microbiology) and one long (for chemistry).
  - Center plot sampling is standardized (centre of 2 x 2 m plot; 15 cm north for the first core; additional cores 15 cm east and west for the other samples).
  - Samples are shipped promptly to ITE Merlewood; short-lifetime samples are posted first-class; longer samples are collected by regional coordinators.
  - Detailed packaging and labeling procedures ensure traceability (envelopes, bags, square/plot identifiers).

- Calluna vulgaris sampling
  - Collect CYG (current year growth) shoots (30–50 g) from randomly selected Calluna plants within the square.
  - Shoots are placed in labeled bags and despatched to ITE Merlewood, with attention to sample dryness if needed.

- Freshwater sampling
  - Conducted by IFE-accredited staff in coordination with CS2000 field teams; integrated planning to avoid overlap and ensure data compatibility.

## Data Capture, Documentation, and Imaging

- Field Assessment and Mapping
  - FAB-based data collection supports a wide range of themes (Physiography, Inland Waters, Coasts, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Forestry, Boundaries, Buildings/Urban, etc.).
  - Emphasis on complete boundary delineation, stockproofing status, and detailed descriptive coding; urban and countryside data are distinguished.

- Photography
  - One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to record appearance and position relative to landmarks.
  - Include square/plot identifiers on a visible board in each shot; compose to highlight plot features and reference points.

- GPS data collection (Annex 1)
  - Systematic GPS usage with battery and satellite status checks; minimum of four satellites and PDOP preferably below 6 for 3D fixes.
  - Stationary (plot) versus moving (boundary) data collection modes; each feature gets its own data file named with square and plot identifiers (e.g., 501X4.PSE; 501F1.MOB).
  - Predefined attribute lists guide feature coding; guidance on handling obstructions, using external aerials, and keypad navigation for data entry.
  - Recording duration typically 3–5 minutes for stationary positions to ensure reliable positioning.

## Procedures After Survey
- Post-survey data reviews to ensure no features are omitted; avoid re-transcribing data unless essential.
- Timely return of FABs and samples to ITE stations to maintain schedule and data integrity.

## End-to-End Data Integrity and Collaboration
- The handbook underscores cross-team standardization, consistent observer practices, and robust quality control to support reliable year-on-year comparisons.
- National coverage is designed to align with remote sensing data, enabling integrated landscape indicators and long-term biodiversity assessments.
- Coordination with external institutes (ITE, IFE) ensures sharing of specialized analyses (soil chemistry, biota, etc.) and centralized storage.

## Key Takeaways for Data Leaders
- Establish and maintain a robust, standardized data architecture (FABs, coding schemes, plots, and BAP alignment) to enable dependable time-series analysis across GB.
- Balance de novo data collection with rigorous change-detection workflows to efficiently monitor landscape change while preserving baseline integrity.
- Prioritize data governance: explicit permissions, field protocols, consistent coding, plot relocation tracking, and comprehensive quality control for multi-stakeholder campaigns.
- Integrate diverse data streams (habitat mapping, vegetation plots, boundaries, and biotic sampling) to inform policy-relevant biodiversity and land-use indicators.
- Ensure transparent data handling, traceability, and interoperable data formats to support national reporting and research collaborations.
