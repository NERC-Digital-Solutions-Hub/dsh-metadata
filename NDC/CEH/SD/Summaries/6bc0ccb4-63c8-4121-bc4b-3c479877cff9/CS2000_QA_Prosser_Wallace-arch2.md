# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose: Assess the consistency and reliability of field work in the Countryside 2000 survey by measuring data quality across major components (plot relocation, species recording, vegetation cover, land-use mapping, and change detection), and compare CS2000 results with the CS1990 baseline.

- Scope: QA exercised on a representative sub-sample (38 of 519 squares; 34 highlighted from 1990; one quarter of each selected square rerecorded) involving 234 vegetation plots across nine plot types.

- Context: Aimed to quantify accuracy of field recording, identify observer/bias effects, relate CS2000 findings to previous CS1990 results, and provide guidance on improving data handling and comparability.

## QA Sample and Methods

- Sub-sample: 38 squares (one quarter resurveyed); includes 34 squares previously surveyed in 1990; plots spanned quadrats, linear plots, and new plot types.
- Plot types: Quadrats and linear plots including road verges, streamsides, boundaries, and hedge-related margins.
- Plot relocation: Assessed relocation of buried plot corners and plates eight years after initial burial; relocation relied on plates, sketches, photos, and metal detectors.
- Data captured: 234 plots across the nine types; field codes for landcover, boundaries, and hedge features; vegetation cover estimates; and land-use changes.
- Analytical framework: Compared CS2000 survey data (TI) with QA reassessment data (T2) to quantify concordance, error types, and bias; used DECORANA ordination to examine directional change; evaluated mapping concordance across primary and qualifying codes and boundary features.

## Key Findings

- Plot relocation
  - Overall relocation success: 86.7% of plots could be relocated satisfactorily; 60% relocated exactly by CS2000 surveyors; ~25% relocated but not exactly; ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - Plate recovery: Assessors located 69.3% of plates; total recovery could be in the 40–45% range when considering all relocation categories; 60% precise plot relocation by surveyors contrasts with greater difficulty locating old plates eight years on than after one year.
  - Hardest plots: Y-plots (habitat plots) had the highest relocation failure (~23%).

- Species concordance
  - Presence/absence: About 71% of records were confirmed by QA as present in the plot; ~2% non-concordances due to real management or seasonal changes.
  - Overall accuracy: Initial recording accuracy around 73%, slightly lower than CS1990 (c. 78%), largely due to plot relocation errors between surveys.
  - Trends: The QA noted mis-matches largely tied to location/orientation errors, and to some extent species mis-identifications and overlooked species.

- Estimates of vegetation cover
  - Comparison across 30 frequent species showed some significant differences between CS2000 surveyors and QA assessors (several grasses highlighted); some discrepancies attributed to seasonal effects.
  - Overall, cover agreement improved relative to earlier QA, but species-specific differences persisted (notably grasses and certain coarse grasses); some species showed significant cover differences (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
  - The pattern suggests cover estimates are reasonably robust for many species but can be sensitive to timing and plot relocation accuracy.

- Direction of vegetation change
  - DECORANA ordination axis: No significant directional shift between CS2000 and QA; axis changes were not consistently biased toward direction of change.
  - By plot type and landclass, no consistent directional bias detected.

- Landcover mapping
  - Code groupings: primary landcover codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes.
  - Concordance levels:
    - Primary landcover codes: high agreement (around 88%); overall primary landcover agreement ~87.5% (excluding BAP).
    - BAP codes (broad habitat types): ~77–78% concordance.
    - Primary boundary codes: ~85% agreement; boundary code concordance ~92%.
    - Hedge/wall codes: moderate concordance (~67.5%); some omissions noted.
  - Overall mapping robustness: Mapping components generally robust; some discrepancies linked to BAP classifications and boundary delineations; changes since 1990 often not captured or misrecorded.

- Change in landuse
  - Overall concordance for recorded change: about 51.4% (moderate); 33.9% where CS2000 did not note a change; 14.7% where change was recorded but not substantiated by assessors.
  - Implication: A substantial proportion of real changes since 1990 may have been missed or misrepresented; surveyors tended to under-record changes when existing 1990 strings already indicated changes.

- Hedge diversity plots
  - Samples: 19 hedge diversity plots; total species recorded 124; common species 92.
  - Concordance: 74.2% overall agreement; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
  - Interpretation: Hedge diversity coding was generally reliable but with notable omissions, reflecting the complexity of hedgerow vegetation.

- Arable plots
  - Sample size: only five plots; concordance was very poor.
  - Explanation: Seasonal variation and limited familiarity with ruderal/arable weeds likely contributed; recommendation to include two well-spaced visits for arable margins in future work.

- Changes in frequency of prevalent species
  - About 35% of mis-matches occurred between common species records; species frequency ranking was broadly similar but with notable inconsistencies due to mis-identifications, overlaps among Poa and Arrhenatherum groups, and seasonal effects.
  - Specific issues highlighted for common grasses and some forbs; the QA emphasized the need for careful species-by-species checks in future iterations.

## Overall Implications for Environmental Analysis

- Data quality and reliability
  - The CS2000 QA demonstrates that the field data are largely reliable for broad habitat assessment and landcover mapping, with high concordance in primary landcover and boundary coding.
  - Observer-related variability exists, particularly in plot relocation precision, species identification (especially grasses), and plant-cover estimation across seasons and plot types.

- Change detection and trend analysis
  - Change recording shows moderate accuracy and a substantial portion of real changes may be missed; caution is warranted when using change statistics from CS2000 without accounting for potential under-recording.

- Mapping and boundary work
  - Landcover and boundary coding are generally robust, but BAP classifications and hedge/wall detail require careful interpretation; improvements in protocol could enhance consistency.

- Recommendations for monitoring practice
  - Enhance relocation protocols and plate-plate verification for long-term monitoring.
  - Consider multiple field visits, especially for arable margins and season-sensitive plots, to reduce mis-records and misalignment.
  - Maintain standardized training and QA checks focused on grasses and common mis-identifications; implement targeted species verification where mis-match rates are high.
  - Document and adjust for seasonal effects when comparing time-series data, particularly for cover estimates and frequency analyses.

## Annexes and Metrics (Illustrative)

- Efficiency and agreement metrics across major components (approximate figures):
  - Plot relocation: ~60% exact relocation; ~86–87% recoverability of plots; ~23% difficulty for some plot types.
  - Plate/location recovery by assessors: ~69%.
  - Species concordance: ~71–74% presence agreement; overall initial recording accuracy around 73%.
  - Vegetation cover: mixed species-specific differences; overall cover agreement reasonably strong but variable by species.
  - Landcover mapping: primary codes ~88% concordance; BAP ~77–78%; boundary codes ~85–93% depending on category; hedge codes lower.
  - Change concordance: ~51% overall; many changes not noted or substantiated.
