# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field sampling framework for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification developed over 30 years.
  - Aims to produce consistent, time-series environmental data suitable for monitoring habitat change and policy performance.
  - Emphasises representativeness, comparability across surveys, and standardized outputs (habitat area estimates, maps, tables).

- Core concepts for analysts
  - Stratified random sampling: to avoid bias and ensure all parts of the landscape are represented.
  - Land Classification as strata: areas are classified into land classes that reflect environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to guide sample allocation.
  - Time-series continuity: methodology linked to previous surveys to enable detection of change over time.

- ITE Land Classification: developmental arc
  - 1978 (initial Land Classification)
    - Basis: 1 km squares classified using environmental attributes; Indicator Species Analysis adapted to large scales.
    - Procedure: center squares (1228) classified; surrounding four squares assigned using the same key.
    - Outcome: 32 land classes; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class) for national estimates.
  - 1984 (land use survey)
    - Expanded sample: 12 squares per class (total 384) to include land use and habitat mapping.
    - Used the 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (CS1990; all-squares classification)
    - Major revision to classify every 1 km square in GB; urban/sea corrections included.
    - Sample: 508 squares; repeat vegetation quadrats and habitat data collected.
    - Result: Land Classification adjusted; national estimates tied to 1990 framework.
  - 2000 (CS2000; separate country estimates)
    - Addressed need for England, Scotland, and Wales reporting with country-specific estimates.
    - Changes:
      - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit classes (creating 40 strata).
      - Additional squares added to ensure representation, including 19 extra for new classes and targeted adjustments to maintain balance between England/Wales and Scotland.
      - Wales-specific sub-division of class 17 and tailored representation to Wales.
      - Isle of Man squares replaced for country-unit reporting.
    - Upland module introduced to improve upland habitat estimates; 30 additional upland squares surveyed.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Wales-focused adjustments)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements driven by devolved governance.
    - Welsh class sub-divisions created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing Wales’ representation.
    - Wales: 64 squares, England: 302, Scotland: 203; total framework expanded to 45 strata.
    - England retained most Welsh adjustments; two English classes (5e, 15e) reduced to 4 squares per class.
    - Visuals: revised land-class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland; sample square maps provided.

- Sampling framework and outputs
  - CS1978 onward: progression from 8 to 12 to 30+ sample squares per class as frameworks expanded.
  - Outputs include: national estimates of habitat areas, class-level distributions, and period-specific survey maps.
  - Tables and figures (e.g., Table 2, Table 3, Figure 4–7) document the distribution of land classes, sample counts, and geographic coverage across surveys and countries.

- Separate country estimates and country-unit approach
  - Rationale: policy needs and legislation require England, Scotland, and Wales-specific habitat status.
  - Method: Land Classes split into country-unit variants; some classes aggregated where representation was low; additional samples allocated to ensure minimum representation per class in each country.
  - Isle of Man: removed from country-unit estimates; replacement squares allocated to England.

- Upland habitat module
  - Added to CS2000 to bolster statistics for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - Included an extra 30 squares in upland/ marginal upland land classes.

- National estimates: approach and considerations
  - Estimates can be derived using the latest Land Classification for consistency with a given survey, or the original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency.
  - Table 4 (notable in the document) contrasts sample sizes by class across surveys under the original 1990 classification, illustrating how methodological changes affect comparability.
  - Emphasises the trade-off between local/regional precision and cross-survey consistency when classifications change.

- Final reflections and implications for monitoring analysts
  - The sampling strategy balances the need for detailed, country-specific habitat information with the practicality of sample sizes and data collection.
  - The evolution of the Land Classification reflects increasing policy needs (country-specific reporting, upland habitats) while preserving time-series continuity.
  - The framework facilitates data quality, accessibility, and potential integration with other environmental data sources, aligning with the archetype’s aims to monitor environmental health over time.
