# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Provides guidelines for CS2000 surveys across Britain, standardising field data collection, and linking field data with satellite/remote sensing.
- Emphasises time-series data on land use, vegetation, and landscape change; supports biodiversity monitoring and policy alignment (e.g., via BAP codes).
- Focuses on data standardisation, traceability, and quality assurance through structured data capture (FABs) and extensive coding schemes.

## Section 10 – Sampling
- Types of sampling in CS2000:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff)
- Background and purpose:
  - Establish baseline soil quality data to develop indices of soil biological activity and diversity; national, spatially referenced sampling in 1 km squares used in the 1978 survey for broader comparability.
- Soil sampling (10.2–10.7):
  - Five replicate soil samples per square (in each X-plot) for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing.
  - Sampling hardware and workflow:
    - Three cores per X-plot: one long black pipe (15 cm long, 5 cm diameter) and two short white pipes (8 cm long, 4 cm diameter)
    - Detailed field procedure for locating sampling points, coring, handling, and packaging (envelopes with labeled bags and pipes, post-dispatch requirements)
  - Sampling in practice:
    - Center plot location used as reference; cores collected at predefined offsets (north, east, west) from the centre
    - Immediate post-sampling handling to preserve sample integrity and timeliness of lab analyses
- Calluna sampling (10.8–10.10):
  - Based on findings linking Calluna vulgaris foliar nitrogen with nitrogen deposition; aim to identify regions exceeding critical deposition loads.
  - Sampling within every square where Calluna occurs:
    - Collect current year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight)
    - Random sampling from multiple Calluna plants; label and seal samples; proper drying if wet
  - Despatch:
    - Samples posted to ITE Merlewood; receipts claimed on T & S forms; either from field station or directly by post
- Freshwater sampling (10.11):
  - Coordinated with IFE; IFE staff may sample in squares in parallel with CS2000 field teams.
- Equipment and distribution (10.6):
  - Specifies items distributed to teams (e.g., cool box, trowel, knives) and packaging for ITE submission
  - Envelopes, piping, and end caps are allocated per square and plot; standardized labeling and post methods
- FABs and data handling (10.7):
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) combine data sheets with enlarged maps to ensure neat, legible data
  - Data handling concepts:
    - Parcel numbers link map features to data entries
    - New parcel numbers for new or changed features
    - CS1990 parcel codes link to 1990 sheets
    - New BAP codes and changes tracked in dedicated columns to maintain longitudinal consistency
  - Change management:
    - Documenting changes in old squares via new rows, renaming parcels (A1, A2, etc.), and cross-referencing with 1990 data
    - Maintains traceability if features shift location or amalgamate
- Plot types and layout (summary):
  - Multiple plot types (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S/W, R/V) to capture varied habitats and vegetation dynamics
  - Nested plots and fixed sizes designed for representative sampling across land types (lowland, upland, enclosed, unenclosed)
- Species data collection:
  - Plot-level vegetation data recorded on standard sheets with ~200 common species; presence/absence and 5% cover increments
  - Unlisted species recorded with Latin names; nested plots capture richness
  - Special handling notes for dominant vegetation types, bryophytes/lichens, and bracken
- Quality, standardisation, and training:
  - Emphasises observer standardisation to improve time-series consistency
  - Annexes cover GPS data collection and integration with GIS
- Annexes and references:
  - GPS data collection annex detailing field procedures and integration with spatial data
  - Comprehensive coding schemes, mapping conventions, and data flows to ensure consistency

## Section 11 – Photography
- Each team receives a camera; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks
- Reference features should be obvious, unique, and permanent; labels placed on a board at the plot edge
- Photos should cover up to half the frame with reference features visible; avoid excessive sky; guidance and examples provided at training

## Section 12 – Procedures After Survey
- Post-survey data checks are essential; verify no features are omitted
- If necessary, data can be transposed to fresh maps/forms, but only in exceptional circumstances
- FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE stations promptly

## Annex 1 – Collecting GPS Data
- Step-by-step GPS workflow:
  - Battery power and satellite checks; ensure at least four satellites and acceptable PDOP (<6 for good 3D fix)
  - Recording stationary positions (plot centers) vs moving features (boundaries)
  - Custom file naming: file names must encode square number and plot/feature ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE)
  - Logging workflow: set sampling rate, select plot/feature names via attribute lists, start/stop logging, and manage files
  - Handling obstructions and aerial extension for improved reception
  - Battery charging notes and almanac updates
  - PDOP guidance and strategies to mitigate poor satellite geometry
- Recording tips:
  - Aim for clear sky views; allow 3–5 minutes for stationary plots
  - Use the attribute reference sheet to quickly select plot IDs
  - Procedures for recording new features using designated attribute codes
- Hardware and software specifics:
  - Magellan keypad usage and addressing common input issues
  - Detailed steps for stationary plot recording and moving feature tracking

## Appendix – Attribute Reference
- Contains reference mappings and quick-access codes linking plot identifiers (e.g., X, D, A, Y, etc.) to dataset entries
- Enables rapid entry of plot IDs and features during field data collection

## Data Standards and Outputs (Implications for Data Support)
- Consistent, longitudinal data capture across years and squares
- Standardised sampling, packaging, and transport for laboratory analyses
- Integrated GIS-ready geolocation data via GPS annexes
- Rich metadata through FABs, parcel coding, and BAP coding to support time-series analyses and policy-aligned indicators
- Comprehensive documentation to enable data quality control, reproducibility, and future re-analysis across CS1990/CS2000 datasets
