# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Introduction and aim
  - Aimed to measure consistency and reliability of the CS2000 field programme across many recorders.
  - QA focused on: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, reliability of percentage cover, effect of recording level on habitat change detection (including directional bias), comparability with CS1990, landuse mapping accuracy, and recording changes in landuse.

- Methods and scope
  - Sample: 38 of 519 squares from CS2000; in each square, one quarter resurveyed.
  - Plots: 234 species plots across nine plot types (quadrats and linear plots).
  - Protocols: relocation of plots and buried plates, field coding and boundary/landcover recording; Annex A/B guidance used; QA assessed plate and plot location, species lists, cover estimates, and codes.
  - Timeframe: eight-year relocation challenge (CS1990 vs CS2000) and annual QA comparisons.

- Key findings

  - Plot relocation
    - Of 210 plots with full search, 86.7% recovery rate (similar to earlier QA).
    - CS2000 surveyors: ~60% accurately relocated plates; ~25% relocated with some accuracy; ~15% inadequately relocated.
    - 8-year relocation feasibility: QA achieved 69.3% plate recovery; approximate total recovery may be 40–45% for exact plate/plot matches; some misplacements occurred (e.g., wrong bank/side of hedge, etc.).
    - Overall interpretation: eight years on, relocation is feasible but accuracy varied; some lapses point to need for improved field locating practices.

  - Species concordance and recording efficiency
    - Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4 (QA records longer lists; ~13% overall increase over time similar to CS1990 QA).
    - Proportion of records concordant at time of QA: ~71% confirmed; ~2% non-concordant due to real management/seasonal changes.
    - Initial recording efficiency in 1998 QA ~73% when accounting for plot relocation differences.
    - Many mis-matches attributed to plot location/orientation errors and to occasional mis-identifications or overlooked species.
    - Overall, QA lists tended to be longer; some differences likely reflect seasonal effects or plot overlap issues.

  - Vegetation cover estimates
    - Among 30 most frequent species, several species showed significant cover differences between CS2000 surveyors and QA assessors (notably several grasses), with some differences seasonally explained.
    - Across many species, cover estimates showed good agreement; in some cases, surveyors gave higher covers than assessors.
    - Overall conclusion: cover estimates are generally reliable, but certain common grasses show notable discrepancies; seasonality influences some differences.

  - Change in direction of vegetation
    - DECORANA axis analysis found no significant overall directional bias between CS2000 and QA.
    - When partitioned by plot type/landclass, most differences were random, not systematically biased.

  - Landcover mapping and boundary coding
    - Landcover code groups: primary codes, secondary descriptive, and cover codes.
    - Primary landcover concordance: 88%; BAP (broad habitat) codes: 77%; overall primary landcover agreement: 87.5%.
    - Landuse boundary/primary boundary concordance: high (primary boundary 92%, overall boundary-related concordance ~85–93% depending on metric).
    - Hedge/wall boundaries: boundary shape and condition codes showed moderate concordance (67.5%); many hedge codes had limited success with new hedge-shape codes.
    - Change in landuse and boundary features: moderate-to-high concordance in some categories, but notable issues with changes, especially where CS2000 did not record changes or assessed changes differed from CS2000’s codes.

  - Change in frequency of the most prevalent species
    - Most common species showed similar ranking between CS2000 and QA, but a number of mismatches occurred (notably mosses and several grasses).
    - Frequency data indicate some systematic over- or under-recording of certain species (e.g., Poa trivialis often over-recorded; several grasses under-recorded or misidentified).

  - Hedge diversity
    - Hedge-diversity plots (H plots): total species 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
    - Hedge plots tended to miss some woody species within the hedge diversity context, contributing to higher “overlooked” counts.

  - Arable plots
    - Very limited data (five arable plots); concordance was very poor.
    - Seasonal variation and lower familiarity with ruderal species likely contributed to mis-recording.
    - Recommendation: for arable margins, plan multiple visits to improve reliability.

  - Overall changes and axis scores
    - DECORANA axis 1: no directional bias across plot types; the mean axis scores CS2000 vs QA were not significantly different.
    - Variation in axis scores was driven by location/orientation, cover-mismatch, and overlooked species rather than a consistent directional change.

- Mapping codes and concordance (summaries)
  - Primary land cover codes: overall concordance ~87.5% (excluding BAP); BAP concordance ~77.4%.
  - Landuse primary qualifying codes: concordance ~73–75% depending on year; overall primary boundary concordance ~92% (boundaries vs qualitative boundary features showed strong consistency).
  - Land cover at sample points: overall concordance ~63% (driven by easy-to-identify species lists such as Lolium spp. and clover); many other species showed higher agreement.
  - Change assessment concordance: overall change concurrence ~51.4%; a substantial portion of changes were not noted by CS2000 or not substantiated by assessors, indicating many changes could be missed or misclassified.

- Overall assessment and implications
  - CS2000 QA demonstrates generally high reliability in mapping and boundary coding, with strong concordance in primary landcover and boundaries.
  - The most significant data quality challenge is plot relocation accuracy and exact plate/plot positioning, which strongly influence species lists and change detection.
  - Change detection between CS1990 and CS2000 shows substantial changes, but a notable proportion of observed changes were not captured or substantiated in QA, suggesting careful interpretation is needed when using change data from single surveys.
  - Arable margin plots require more intensive sampling due to low reliability in small samples and high seasonal/identification variability.
  - Overall, while CS2000 QA indicates robust data in many respects, it highlights areas for methodological improvement in field locating, change coding, and arable margins to enhance end-user usability and reduce rework.

- Practical takeaway for data support perspective
  - For organisations applying similar QA: ensure explicit protocols for plot/plate relocation and documenting non-detections; build in cross-checks for plot orientation and location to reduce mismatches.
  - When communicating outputs, accompany with caveats about potential changes not captured and the influence of seasonal variation on species presence/cover in certain plot types.
  - Invest in training for accurate identification of grasses and mosses, and for arable ruderal species, to improve concordance in future surveys.
