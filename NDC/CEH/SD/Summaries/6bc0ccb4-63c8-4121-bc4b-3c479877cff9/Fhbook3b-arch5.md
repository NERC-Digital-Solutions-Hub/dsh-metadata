# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview and purpose
- A national countryside survey framework to standardize field data collection, improve data quality, and enable time-series analyses across Great Britain.
- Designed to produce current land cover, landscape, and vegetation data, with outputs suitable for government, NGOs, and policy support.
- Implements a two-tier sampling framework and emphasizes change-detection and broad-habitat reporting.

## Data governance, standards, and provenance
- Uses coded Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) and data recording forms to ensure consistent metadata, codes, and data lineage.
- Maintains explicit mappings between CS1990 codes and CS2000 outputs to enable traceability and auditability.
- Standardisation aims to reduce observer variance; documents quality control procedures, training, and comment fields for atypical data.
- Establishes robust provenance: square-level sampling records, parcel numbers, CS1990 parcel codes, primary codes, descriptive/numerical codes, and unique/temporary codes when needed.
- Supports change tracking across years (1990–1998), including logging, re-numbering, or splitting features and documenting new vs changed features on theme maps and BAP maps.
- Plans data integration across multiple outputs (theme maps, BAP maps, ponds maps) and prepares for future baselines via plots and GPS tagging.

## Sampling framework and study design
- Core sampling of around 508–568 squares UK-wide; stratified by ITE Land Classes with country-specific adjustments.
- Time-series integrity maintained by re-surveying previously sampled squares; additional squares added to reflect new classes and country units.
- Targeted extra sampling in uplands; two-tier approach (Mappable Broad Habitats vs Plottable Broad Habitats) to address upland-lownland mapping differences.
- Aims for repeat sampling (e.g., 1998 CS2000) and detailed country/module square distributions.

## Data recording, mapping framework, and outputs
- Three core data elements: mapping, vegetation plots, and sampling.
- Mapping focuses on change in old squares and reports land-cover changes by broad habitats; upland patterns emphasized.
- Broad Habitat framework aligned with UK Biodiversity Action Plans; some rare habitats may require extrapolation beyond sample coverage.
- Upland, unenclosed landscapes use plot-based methods to supplement boundary-mapped data.
- FAB accompanies maps; complete documentation is essential even if order is not strict.

## Plotting, vegetation sampling, and field methods
- Plot types across squares (CS2000): Areal plots; X, Y plots; U plots; B (Boundary) plots; A (Arable field margins) plots; H (Hedgerow) plots; D (Hedgerow diversity) plots; S (Streamside) and W (Waterside) plots; R (Roadside) and V (Verge) plots.
- Procedures cover locating/relocating plots, GPS tagging for upland baselines, and standardized measurement methods; use of permanent markers and plates for relocation.
- Recording of species presence and cover, with nested plot progression; top 200 species list and guidance for aggregations where precise IDs are challenging.
- Bryophyte/lichen recording limited to defined lists to ensure continuity with historical datasets.
- Special attention to curtilages, built environments, and urban interfaces to avoid misclassification.

## Data recording, mapping, and boundary documentation
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) data documentation supports consistent boundary coding, ownership, physiography, hydrology, agriculture, forestry, and infrastructure attributes.
- Boundaries, hedges, walls, fences, and other linear features mapped with persistent, well-documented codes.
- Photographs and plan sketches accompany FABs to aid relocation and interpretation; photographs reference square/plot IDs and key landmarks.

## Output formats and data products
- Outputs include FAB data sheets, theme maps, BAP maps, and pond maps.
- Data structured to support national reporting, policy development, and sustainable development indicators (e.g., Biodiversity Action Plans, Rural White Paper commitments).
- Protocols for data integration with national datasets, cross-year comparability, and potential satellite-derived land-cover integration.

## Sampling procedures: soils, Calluna, and freshwater
- Soil sampling (within CS2000): in each square, five replicate soil samples collected from X-plots, sent to ITE Merlewood for analyses (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), with quick processing for certain components; standardized sampling points and protocols described.
- Calluna sampling: collect current-year growth (CYG) shoots from Calluna vulgaris within squares for foliar nitrogen analyses to assess deposition impacts.
- Freshwater sampling: coordinated with accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff who may sample concurrently with CS2000 teams.

## Permissions, access, and field constraints
- Explicit landowner/farmer consent required; refused access may lead to square abandonment or relocation.
- Landowner cooperativeness documented to inform future surveys; ownership updates and contact details continuously refined.

## Photographic documentation
- Cameras provided; photographs of vegetation plots accompany data, showing general appearance and position relative to landmarks.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, unique, and within a viewable distance; frames should balance plot coverage and landmark visibility.

## Procedures after survey
- Daily data checks to ensure completeness; transposition to new maps/forms only if essential.
- Transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations as soon as possible.

## Annex: GPS data collection and relocation
- Step-by-step guidance for GPS setup, logging stationary and moving features, file naming (custom file names combining square and plot IDs, e.g., 501X4.PSE), and data rate settings.
- Guidelines for ensuring data quality (satellite count, PDOP, obstructions) and how to handle almanac data updates.
- Instructions for relocating plots accurately and using GPS-derived coordinates for new baselines.
- Battery management, data logging controls, and equipment handling specifics.

## Key challenges for Data Stewards
- Ensuring completeness and timeliness of data; capturing full user-needs perspectives and timely data supply from landowners and field teams.
- Achieving standardisation across diverse systems, habitats, surveyors, and outputs; maintaining consistent metadata and coding schemes.
- Managing large, complex datasets (primary/secondary codes, mosaics, unique codes) with reproducibility and audit trails.
- Handling boundary changes, plot relocations, and cross-year re-numbering while preserving data lineage.
- Integrating diverse data outputs (cadastral boundaries, vegetation, hydrology, infrastructure) into coherent, interoperable datasets for policy and research use.

## Summary takeaway
- CS2000 provides a rigorous, coded data collection framework designed to produce standardized, time-series countryside data with explicit provenance, change-tracking, and multiple outputs (maps, FABs, plots).
- Effective data governance requires adherence to standard codes, robust documentation, explicit change-tracking rules, and GPS-based relocation to ensure long-term usability, comparability, and discoverability for reuse by diverse data users.
