# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview and aims
- Provides standardized procedures for CS2000 field work across Great Britain, focusing on soil, vegetation, and landscape data collection to support change detection and biodiversity indicators.
- Integrates bottom-up field plots with remote sensing and broad habitat classifications to enable robust trend analysis.
- Emphasizes time-series data, quality control, reproducibility, and metadata-rich data products.

## Vegetation and species coding references
- Contains extensive coded references for flora and bryophytes, including FORBS/WOODY SPECIES and MOSSES/LICHENS sections.
- Uses abbreviations (e.g., Athy fil, Dryo fil) that map to full taxa; includes mappings between older and updated taxonomic names (e.g., Athyrium filix-femina = Dryopteris dilatata).
- Provides cross-references and synonym mappings to facilitate consistent data entry and later analysis across survey rounds.

## Sampling framework (Section 10)
- Three sampling types in CS2000:
  - Soil sampling (field surveyors): baseline soil chemistry, soil fauna, and microbiology in 1 km squares.
  - Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen analysis as an indicator of nitrogen deposition; used to identify regions exceeding critical loads.
  - Freshwater biota sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff, coordinated with field surveys.
- Rationale and context:
  - Builds a national, spatially referenced soil dataset from the same squares as the 1978 survey to support soil sustainability indices.

## Soil sampling design and methods
- In each square, five replicate soil samples are collected per soil chemistry analyses, soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status.
- Sampling location and method:
  - Within each X-plot’s 2 x 2 m center plot, three cores are taken: one long (black pipe) and two short (white pipes) at specific positions (e.g., 15 cm N of the north corner).
  - Samples are packaged in labeled envelopes and posted to ITE Merlewood; rapid processing is emphasized for short shelf-life components.
- Sample processing:
  - Short-term samples (soil fauna, microbiology) shipped by First Class post; chemistry samples collected by regional coordinators and taken to Merlewood by car.
- Equipment and logistics:
  - Specific gear distribution to teams (cool box, pipes, knives, trowels, markers, etc.) with detailed packaging instructions to ensure traceability.

## Calluna sampling
- Within Calluna vulgaris sites, collect current year’s growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants.
- Samples are sealed in labeled bags and despatched to ITE Merlewood; guidance provided for very wet samples and post-despatch procedures.

## Freshwater sampling
- Conducted by IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 coordinators to minimize conflict with field teams; sampling times arranged to suit both parties.

## Photography (Section 11)
- Each team is issued cameras; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks.
- Reference features must be obvious, permanent, and within a frame that preserves plot context; label plots with square and plot numbers visible in photos.
- Photos should balance plot coverage and landmark visibility; avoid excessive sky in shots.

## Procedures after survey (Section 12)
- Post-fieldwork data checks:
  - Review data sheets daily to prevent omissions; if needed, data may be transposed to fresh maps only in exceptional cases.
- Logistics:
  - FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE stations promptly to ensure data integrity.

## GPS data collection (Annex)
- Step-by-step protocol for accurate GPS data collection to support plot relocation and mapping accuracy.
- Key elements:
  - Battery power checks, satellite count (minimum four), and PDOP targets (preferably below 6 for 3D fixes).
  - Distinct file naming convention for GPS data: Square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE) and feature designations for new boundaries or features (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
  - Stationary vs. moving logging modes, with explicit instructions to start and stop logging and to manage data files.
- Practical guidance:
  - Handling obstructions by elevating the GPS antenna, avoiding poor sky views, and ensuring repeatable plotting via permanent markers and georeferenced photographs.

## Data quality, accessibility, and integration
- Emphasizes standardized data collection, robust metadata, and reproducible plotting schemes.
- Seeks alignment of field plots with broader habitat maps and national biodiversity indicators.
- Prioritizes timely data transfer and documentation to ensure data are discoverable and usable for future analyses.
