# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- A Quality Assurance (QA) evaluation of the CS2000 field programme was conducted to measure consistency and reliability across major field components, acknowledging inherent variation from many recorders and surveyors.
- The QA covered a subsample of 38 out of 519 squares surveyed in 1998, with one quarter of each square re-surveyed for 234 plots across nine plot types.

## Aims

- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in CS2000 and comment on change statistics.
- Assess plot relocation efficiency and precision.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, plot location/orientation, plot type, management, and season.
- Relate CS2000 recording accuracy to CS1990 QA benchmarks and prior QA performance.
- Assess mapping accuracy (land cover, boundaries, and hedge/wall features) and changes since 1990.

## Scope and Methods

- Selection: 38 squares; one quarter re-surveyed; 234 plots across plot types (quadrats, X/Y/U plots, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, etc.).
- Plot relocation and plate recovery: attempted relocation of buried plates marking quadrats eight years on; multiple methods used (sketch maps, photos, metal detector).
- Data categories examined: species presence/absence, percent cover, landcover codes (primary, secondary, cover), landuse changes, boundary features, hedge/wall configurations.
- Annexed procedures detail site selection, plotting grid (Q1–Q9), and relocation protocol.

## Key Findings

### Plot Relocation
- Of 210 plots with full search, 86.7% were satisfactorily relocated.
- CS2000 surveyors precisely relocated 60% of the 1990 plots; about 25% relocated further; ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate recovery: assessors located 69.3% of plates; overall plot/plate recovery rate around 40–45% when considering both old and new plots.
- Y-plots (4 m) were the most difficult to relocate (23% failure).
- Overall implication: eight years on, relocation remains feasible but less precise than the initial survey; greater effort or improved marking may be needed for future cycles.

### Species Concordance (presence/absence)
- Approximately 6000 records across 210 plots; 71% of species were confirmed present by QA; ~2% non-concordances due to management/seasonal changes.
- Initial recording accuracy estimated at ~73%, with the remaining discrepancy largely due to plot mis-location.
- Across plot types, the QA generally found higher species counts in QA than in CS2000, with increases similar to earlier QA results (1991 QA over 1990: ~13.0%; 1998 QA over 1998 CS: ~13.97%).
- Rank ordering of plots by species richness largely matched between CS2000 and QA, though some shifts occurred (notably road verges and streamsides).
- Mis-match types identified include mis-identifications, overlooked species, orientation/location errors, and changes due to management/season.

### Vegetation Cover (percentage cover)
- Visual cover estimates for species >5% were replicated in QA; overall agreement across plot types showed notable concordance.
- Specific species showed significant differences in mean cover between CS2000 and QA for some grasses (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Arrhenatherum elatius) with some p-values indicating systematic differences; other species differences were not significant.
- A substantial portion of cover agreement was species-specific; broadly, cover codes between surveyors and QA were reasonably aligned, though some overestimation by surveyors occurred for certain species.

### Landcover Mapping and Boundaries
- Landcover code concordance:
  - Primary landcover codes: high concordance overall (87.5% including BAP; excluding BAP, 91.6%).
  - BAP (broad habitat) codes: lower concordance (77.4%), reflecting broader/less precise classification challenges.
  - Primary boundary codes and related boundary features showed high concordance:
    - Boundary coding: CS2000 vs QA overall concordance ~85%; boundary code concordance ~92%.
    - Hedge/wall shapes and boundary condition codes (including hedge types, stockproof nature, and wall condition) showed substantial agreement but with some coding mismatches, particularly with newer hedge codes and wall condition interpretations.
- Change in land use and boundaries:
  - Primary code changes: some discordance; several entries showed changes misrecorded or omitted.
  - Change concordance overall: 51.4% (i.e., about half of changes were concordant); 33.9% of changes noted by CS2000 were not acknowledged by QA; 14.7% changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors.
  - Summary: substantial portion of eight-year changes were difficult to verify; CS2000 data tended to miss or miscode some real changes.

### Hedge Diversity and Arable Plots
- Hedge diversity plots: total concordance around 74% at the species level with QA generally recording more species, suggesting appropriate but uneven coverage across hedge features.
- Arable plots: only five plots; concordance was very poor, with seasonality and limited familiarity with ruderal species likely contributing to high mis-match rates. Recommendation: multiple visits and season-aware sampling for arable margins.

## Data Quality Metrics (Overview)

- Plot relocation: ~60% precise relocation; ~25% approximate; ~15% inadequate; 86.7% plots satisfactorily relocated; 69.3% plate recovery by QA; overall recovery around 40–45%.
- Species concordance: ~71% initial agreement; ~2% management/seasonal changes; mean species per plot higher in QA than CS2000 (e.g., all plots: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4).
- Species coverage: partial cover agreement ~74.4% for cover codes; some species show significant differences in mean cover between CS2000 and QA.
- Landcover mapping: primary landcover concordance ~87.5% overall; BAP concordance ~77.4%; boundary features concordance high (boundary codes ~92%); hedge/wall codes less consistent.
- Change concordance: ~51.4% overall; sizable portion of changes not noted or not substantiated; indicates under-recording of real changes or misapplication of codes.
- Overall assessment: CS2000 fieldwork demonstrates solid reliability in many mapping and boundary coding tasks, with notable room for improvement in plot relocation precision, change detection rigor, and some arable/seasonal aspects.

## Practical Implications for Data Leaders

- Data provenance and governance:
  - Preserve detailed location/relocation metadata and preserve permanent markers where feasible to improve future cross-time comparisons.
  - Maintain consistent coding schemes, with clear documentation of when BAP vs unenclosed habitat codes are applied.
- Data quality assurance:
  - Implement robust QA workflows during fieldwork, emphasizing plot relocation accuracy and explicit change recording protocols.
  - Ensure seasonal context is captured for arable margins and other seasonally dynamic habitats to reduce mis-matches.
- Data integration and governance across networks:
  - Align field protocols and coding practices across partners to reduce cross-survey discrepancies and improve comparability with CS1990 benchmarks.
  - Capture and publish explicit error categories (mis-location, mis-orientation, mis-identification, overlooked species) to guide future training and process improvements.
- Actionable recommendations for future surveys:
  - Consider enhanced marking of plots, improved plate recovery strategies, or alternative permanent plot identification to boost relocation efficiency.
  - Increase sampling intensity or repeated visits for arable margins and hedges where variability is high.
  - Expand training and calibration exercises to reduce systematic differences in covers and habitat coding, particularly for grasses and hedge-related codes.

## Summary Takeaways

- The CS2000 QA exercise confirms that the CS2000 field programme is generally reliable, with strong mapping and boundary coding performance, and reasonable consistency with CS1990 QA benchmarks.
- Key improvement areas include plot relocation precision, robust capture of eight-year changes, and arable margin sampling; seasonal effects and observer bias contribute to specific discrepancies in species and cover data.
- For Data Leaders, the results underscore the importance of rigorous location metadata, standardized coding and metadata practices, and ongoing QA integration to ensure data products meet user needs and remain comparable across time and partners.
