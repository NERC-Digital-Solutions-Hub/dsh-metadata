# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose and scope
  - Assess consistency and reliability of CS2000 field work due to many recorders and potential variation.
  - QA sampled 38 of 519 squares; in each, one quarter was resurveyed, covering 234 species plots across nine plot types.
  - Investigated plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, accuracy of percentage cover estimates, direction of habitat change, comparability with CS1990, landuse mapping accuracy, and recording of changes.

- Methods and setup
  - Plot types included quadrats (200 m and smaller), road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, and hedge-related plots.
  - Location verification used buried plates, sketches, photographs, and metal detectors; assessment compared CS2000 plots with QA plots.
  - Annexed procedures detail the sampling design, data collection, and change-coding framework.

- Key QA findings

  - Plot relocation and plate recovery
    - Of 210 CS2000 plots, 86.7% were satisfactorily relocated; ~60% relocated precisely, ~25% relocated with some accuracy, ~15% inadequately relocated.
    - Plate/plot recovery by QA assessors: about 69.3% of CS2000 plates recovered; overall relocation efficiency ~60% with ~25% partial relocation and ~15% poor relocation.
    - Comparison with the CS1990 QA showed similar recovery rates eight years apart, indicating relocation is feasible over long times but requires careful searching.
  
  - Species concordance and recording accuracy
    - CS2000 field records: ~71% of species present in plots were confirmed by QA; ~2% non-concordances attributed to real changes (management or seasonal effects).
    - Overall initial recording accuracy around 73%, with differences largely due to plot relocation errors.
    - The QA period yielded longer species lists per plot (QA mean ~20.4 vs CS2000 mean ~17.9); similar magnitude of increase to prior QA; ordering of plots by richness largely matched between survey and QA.

  - Vegetation cover estimates
    - Agreement on mean percent cover between surveyors and assessors was generally good, but significant discrepancies (especially for grasses) occurred for some species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Elymus repens, Eriophorum vaginatum).
    - Seasonal effects contributed to some cover discrepancies; several cases showed over- or under-estimation relative to QA.

  - Change in vegetation and direction of change
    - DECORANA ordination axis changes showed no significant directional bias between CS2000 and QA.
    - When plots were grouped by landclass, axis positions varied by landclass but there was no consistent drift indicating bias across years.
    - Overall, 31 plots were omitted or excluded from certain ordination analyses due to sampling design; remaining data suggested random scatter rather than systematic bias.

  - Landcover mapping and coding
    - Primary land cover codes: high concordance between CS2000 and QA (about 88%); BAP (broad habitat) coding concordance about 77%; overall primary land cover agreement around 87.5%.
    - Landuse primary qualifying codes showed strong concordance overall; minor discrepancies often related to boundaries and misclassification of specific codes.
    - Boundaries and hedge/woodland features:
      - Primary boundary code concordance around 92%; boundary height and stockproof status around 83–89%.
      - Hedge shape coding (new codes 374–380) had limited success; hedge-related omissions still occurred.
    - Change coding:
      - Concordance in recording change was relatively low (overall ~51%), with ~33.9% of changes not noted by CS2000 and ~14.7% of changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors.
      - Many changes since 1990 appeared to be missed or misrecorded; the data suggest plotting data may be more reliable for detecting change than static codes alone.

  - Landuse and boundary change specifics
    - Changes in crop type, hedge type, and stockproof status were among the categories assessed; misalignments often stemmed from location/orientation errors or miscodings.
    - The QA highlighted the need for careful interpretation and documentation of boundary and landcover changes to ensure accurate longitudinal comparisons.

  - Arable plots
    - Five arable margins were analyzed; concordance was very poor, likely influenced by seasonal variation, limited familiarity with ruderal species, and identification challenges in arable weed communities.
    - Recommendation: plan multiple visits (well-spaced) for arable margin plots to improve reliability.

- Annexes and protocol notes
  - Annex A/B: detailed QA protocols, field procedures, and timing; specifics on sampling squares and plot relocation methods.
  - Annex B: dates and efficiency measures across sampled squares; provides a breakdown of efficiency by landclass and plot type.

- Implications for data stewardship and governance
  - Data quality and provenance
    - The QA demonstrates robust methodologies to quantify accuracy and biases in field data, essential for credible discovery and reuse.
    - Documentation of plot relocation success rates, species concordance, cover estimation differences, and boundary/code concordances provides important metadata for data users.

  - Data quality improvements and maintenance
    - Emphasizes the need for consistent plot marking, stable sketch maps, and standardized coding to minimize mislocation and misclassification errors.
    - Highlights seasonal effects on plant records and cover estimates; suggests incorporating seasonal timing as a metadata element.

  - Change detection and longitudinal studies
    - Low overall change concordance indicates that detecting genuine habitat change over time requires careful differentiation between real changes and coding/location errors.
    - For robust change analysis, greater emphasis should be placed on plot relocation accuracy, boundary fidelity, and consistent coding.

  - Practical recommendations for data stewards
    - Maintain detailed QA metadata for each plot: relocation success category, plate status, location accuracy, and recording methods.
    - Ensure standardized field protocols and training to minimize observer bias and misclassification, especially for grasses and arable weeds.
    - Plan for multiple visits in arable margins to capture seasonally variable flora and improve concordance.
    - When integrating CS2000 data with CS1990/QA datasets, account for identified error sources (location/orientation, cover estimation, and boundary coding) to avoid biased trend analyses.

- Conclusion
  - The Countryside Survey 2000 QA exercise confirms generally high data quality for mapping and species recording, with strong concordance in landcover coding and boundaries.
  - Notable gaps exist in change detection and some plot relocations, underscoring the need for thorough metadata, standardized protocols, and targeted improvements in field techniques to support reliable data discovery, sharing, and reuse.
