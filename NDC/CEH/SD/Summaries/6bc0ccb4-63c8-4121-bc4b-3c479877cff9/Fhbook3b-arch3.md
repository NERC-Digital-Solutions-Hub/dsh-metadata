# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Three types of sampling conducted within CS2000:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna vulgaris (foliar) sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff)

- Purpose and context:
  - Establish baseline, spatially referenced data to monitor soil quality and vegetation dynamics across GB.
  - Use the same 1 km squares as the CS1990 survey for comparability and integration with broader policy-relevant indicators.

- Section 10 – Sampling
  - 10.2 Background: national, spatially referenced soil samples from CS2000 to support soil sustainability indices; baseline data to enable standards development.
  - 10.3 Soil sampling in each square:
    - Five replicate samples per square for soil chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and soil microbiological status.
    - Samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing and storage.
  - 10.4 Sampling cores:
    - Three cores per X-plot: two long and one short, using plastic piping.
  - 10.5 Sample handling:
    - Shortest pipes for rapid processing due to shelf-life; immediate posting for two short pipes; largest pipes kept in car until collection.
  - 10.6 Equipment and distribution:
    - Specific items distributed to teams; envelopes, pipes, and labeling to accompany samples.
  - 10.7 Detailed soil sampling procedure (centre plot in each X-plot):
    - Locate and mark sampling points (north, east, west of centre) at 15 cm offsets.
    - Use long black pipe for first sample, two white short pipes for subsequent samples.
    - Capture soil, seal in labelled bags, and post/store according to protocol.
  - 10.8 Calluna sampling background:
    - Foliar nitrogen concentrations linked to nitrogen deposition; aim to identify regions with deposition above critical loads.
  - 10.9 Collect Calluna samples:
    - Collect current year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from random plants within the square.
    - Proper labeling, drying (if needed), and packaging into addressed envelopes for despatch.
  - 10.10 Despatch of Calluna samples:
    - Either despatched from the research station or posted directly to ITE Merlewood; obtain a receipt for postage.
  - 10.11 Freshwater sampling:
    - Coordinated with IFE; field surveyors may work concurrently with IFE staff; arrangements coordinated by co-ordinators.

- Section 11 – Photography
  - One camera per team; film stock provided; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and landmarks.
  - Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and identifiable for future visits.
  - Photos must include square and plot numbers on a marker board; composition should show sufficient plot area and references; avoid excessive sky.

- Section 12 – Procedures after survey
  - 12.1–12.3 Post-survey checks:
    - Review data sheets to ensure no features are omitted.
    - Avoid transcription onto new maps unless necessary; transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

- Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data
  - Step-by-step GPS protocol (Magellan unit):
    - Check power, satellite availability, and PDOP (target below 6 for good 3D fix).
    - Record stationary positions for plots; moving positions for new boundaries.
    - Create individual data files named with square and plot identifiers (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to ensure traceability.
    - Set sampling rate to 1 second; assign plot/feature names using a predefined attribute list; start/stop logging as directed.
    - Manage data files and battery charging; handle almanac updates automatically.
  - Common issues and tips:
    - Poor footing or obstructions may affect signal; use aerial extension if needed and ensure clear sky view.
    - Use the attribute reference list to quickly enter plot identifiers (e.g., D1, X4) and avoid scrolling.
  - File naming conventions:
    - Each plot/feature has a unique data file name; new features include a clear reference (e.g., 501F1.MOB) and corresponding notes on the FAB.

- Data capture, integrity, and governance
  - FABs (Field Assessment Booklets) and maps are the primary data capture tools; emphasis on complete, neat, legible entries.
  - Parcel and feature coding tied to FAB records for traceability; consistent cross-referencing with ITE datasets.
  - QA considerations: standardized procedures, clear documentation, and guidance for handling atypical categories; GPS data quality and relocation procedures documented.

- Appendix notes
  - Attribute reference lists and sheets facilitate rapid entry of plot identifiers and features.
  - Guidance on photography, GPS data management, and post-survey data handling is complemented by annexed materials and equipment lists.

- Key design principles for monitoring framework authors reflected in this handbook
  - Standardization of field methods and coding across teams and years for comparability.
  - Multi-method, spatially explicit data collection (soil, vegetation, freshwater) aligned to square-based sampling.
  - Robust data capture, metadata, and traceability through structured forms (FABs), GPS data with explicit naming, and cross-referencing with established datasets.
  - Coordination with external institutes to expand monitoring reach (e.g., ITE, IFE) and ensure integrated data flows.
  - Clear post-survey procedures to ensure data integrity and timely delivery for analysis.
