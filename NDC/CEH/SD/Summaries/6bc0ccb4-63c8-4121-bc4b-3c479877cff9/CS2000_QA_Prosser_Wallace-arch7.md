# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- Quality Assurance (QA) exercise to assess consistency and reliability of CS2000 field work across 38 of 519 squares surveyed in 1998.
- Resurvey of one quarter in each square, totaling 234 species plots across nine plot types.
- Aims to quantify recording accuracy, plot relocation efficiency, and to compare CS2000 with CS1990.

## Aims and Scope
- quantify the accuracy of field recording in CS2000 and comment on change statistics.
- examine efficiency of plot relocation.
- explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, plot location/orientation, plot type, management, and season.
- relate QA findings to the 1990 Countryside Survey.

## Methods and Scope
- Sampling: 38 squares; 234 plots recorded (9 plot types: quadrats, X/Y/U plots, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins).
- Plate and plot relocation: buried plates marked corners of quadrats; relocation attempted eight years later; comparisons with 1990 QA.
- Recording elements: landcover mapping, boundary features, hedge/stockproof boundaries, and hedge shapes (Annex A/B references).
- Metrics tracked: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, vegetation cover accuracy, landcover coding concordance, boundary coding, and change recording.

## Key Findings

Plot Relocation
- Relocation success: 86.7% of plots could be satisfactorily relocated.
- Relative performance: CS2000 surveyors exactly relocated 60%; about 25% relocated acceptably; ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate recovery: assessors located plates in 69.3% of cases; overall recovery potentially around 40–45% for exact plate/plot matches.
- Most difficult plots: 4 m Habitat (Y) plots with 23% failure.
- Compared with CS1990 QA (87.1% in 1991 QA), relocation performance was similar in overall recoverability, despite eight-year separation.

Species Concordance
- Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4 (higher in QA).
- Concordance: about 71% of CS2000 records were confirmed by QA at time of resurvey; 2% accounted for real changes due to management/season between surveys.
- Overall efficiency of recording: CS2000 QA efficiency comparable to CS1990 QA; increases in QA reflect additional species detected due to plot/location effects.
- Frequency and composition: QA often produced longer species lists; changes in richness across plot types tracked and broadly similar to previous QA patterns.

Estimates of Vegetation Cover
- Cover values for several frequent species showed differences between CS2000 and QA (notably grasses such as Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Elymus repens, and others).
- For many species, cover agreement was reasonably good, though some significant differences persisted (e.g., certain grasses). Seasonal effects likely contributed.
- Overall, cover concordance varied by species; some species showed statistically significant differences between surveyors and assessors.

Direction of Vegetation Change
- DECORANA ordination: overall axis shift between CS2000 and QA was insignificant; no consistent directional bias detected across plot types or landclasses.
- Variability in recording (location/orientation, species identification, and cover assignments) did not produce systematic bias in the direction of change.

Landcover Mapping
- Code groups: primary landcover, secondary descriptive, and cover codes (plus BAP and boundary codes).
- Primary landcover concordance: high (88%); including BAP codes reduces concordance (to 87.5% overall when BAPs included).
- BAP codes: concordance lower (77.4%), reflecting broader habitat classification challenges.
- Land-use sample points: species awarded cover at points showed moderate concordance (63%), with better agreement for common species; overall, few major systematic errors in landuse coding aside from seasonality and identification issues.
- Change in landuse codes: alignment between CS2000 and QA was imperfect; some changes were misrepresented or missed, highlighting challenges in detecting and coding habitat changes over eight years.

Recording of Change
- Overall change concurrence: 51.4%; a substantial portion of changes were not noted by CS2000 or were not substantiated by QA.
- Notable issue: many CS2000 changes appeared to reflect original miscodings or coding omissions rather than genuine transformation.
- Conclusion: changes since 1990 are difficult to verify solely from CS2000 data; QA suggests plot data may be more reliable for change evaluation, but recording changes remains a weakness.

Hedge Diversity and Other Plot Types
- Hedge diversity (H plots): total species 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
- Arable plots: only five samples; concordance very poor, with substantial seasonal and identification challenges noted; recommendation for multiple visits to arable margins if data are to be used.

Overall Mapping and Boundary Features
- Primary boundaries: strong concordance; total boundary-related concordance around 85–92% depending on code type and boundary qualifier.
- Boundary features (hedge shapes, walls): moderate concordance (67.5%), with ongoing issues in hedge shape coding and occasional misclassification of walls.

## Data Quality Implications for GIS Specialists
- Location accuracy and plot relocation are critical: eight-year plate relocation introduces notable uncertainty; many analyses will rely on approximate plot matches.
- Coding consistency matters: high concordance for primary landcover and boundaries supports robust GIS products, but BAP codes and land-use qualifiers require careful cross-walking and metadata.
- Change detection is challenging: only about half of changes observed by CS2000 were supported by QA; caution needed when using CS2000 changes for long-term trend analysis.
- Seasonal effects and plot overlap influence species lists and cover estimates; GIS analyses should account for potential seasonal biases and non-overlapping sampling.
- Data integration needs: maintain coding crosswalks (CS2000 vs QA) and include QA metadata to document when data originated from CS2000 or QA assessments.

## Recommendations for GIS Data Production and QA
- Improve permanence and traceability of plots: consider more durable markers or more frequent re-marking to enhance relocation reliability.
- Increase arable margin sampling with multiple visits to reduce seasonal and identification biases.
- Maintain and publish detailed code crosswalks: primary land cover, BAP, boundary, hedge shape, and landuse codes to support consistent GIS interpretation.
- Include QA metadata in GIS datasets: flag whether a observation/record came from CS2000 fieldwork or QA reassessment, and note potential relocation or orientation uncertainties.
- Exercise caution with change data: treat CS2000 change records as indicative, validated where QA corroborates; use plot-based change analyses as more reliable indicators of change.
- Use DECORANA/ordination insights to understand axis-score shifts in GIS-derived analyses, recognizing that lack of directional bias supports robust long-term comparisons.

## Annex Highlights (Coding and Tables)
- Primary land cover concordance: overall 87.5% when including BAP codes; 91.6% excluding BAPs.
- BAP codes concordance: 77.4%.
- Landuse primary qualifying code concordance (1990 vs 1998): around 73–81% depending on category; changes in boundaries and hedges show notable concordance but with some systematic misclassifications.
- Hedge/ boundary coding: boundary height and stockproof status show high concordance (around 83–92%), while hedge shapes coding had more ambiguity.
- Species cover at landuse sample points: overall 63% concordance; several key species showed lower agreement, reflecting identification and cover-drawing challenges.
- Change recording: overall 51.4% concordance for recorded changes; substantial under-reporting or misrepresentation of real changes noted.
