# Dataset Documentation

- Overview
  - Countryside Survey data (© NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology) provides national estimates of landscape linear feature stock for 1998, calculated using the 2007 ITE Land Classification (Scott 2007; Bunce et al. 2007).
  - Estimates are total lengths in metres for each linear feature type per 1km square per Land Class.
  - Note: there may be negative values in LC2007 due to the statistical model; treat these as zero.
- Data structure and fields
  - FID: Feature ID (autonumber)
  - Shape: Geometry
  - LC2007: ITE Land Class (numeric)
  - LC2007_COD: ITE Land Class (text code)
  - CSYEAR: Year of survey
  - LCAREA: Total area of relevant Land Class (00s ha)
  - LF_1: Hedges (metres per 1km square per land class)
  - LF_3: Wall (metres per 1km square per land class)
  - LF_4: Line of trees/shrubs/relict hedge/fence
  - LF_5: Line of trees/shrubs/relict hedge
  - LF_6: Bank/grass strip
  - LF_7: Fence
  - LFTOTAL: Total length of linear features
  - Shape_Length: Length of Land Class shape
  - Shape_Area: Area of Land Class
- Linear features defined
  - _1 Hedges: managed woody vegetation; may accompany other features
  - _3 Wall: built stone/manufactured walls; may include fences or banks/grass strips
  - _4 Line of trees/shrubs/relict hedge/fence: natural-shaped line of trees/shrubs; may include banks/grass strips
  - _5 Line of trees/shrubs/relict hedge: natural-shaped line of trees/shrubs; may include avenues
  - _6 Bank/grass strip: earth/stone-faced bank or grass strip with/without a fence
  - _7 Fence: permanent posts and wires/rails; may include accompanying grass strip, ditch, or stream
  - TOTAL: total length of all linear features
- Reporting approach
  - Six major feature types reported with a hierarchical system
  - No double counting of multi-element features
  - Hedges take precedence in reporting when found with other features; hedge lengths are not overlapped into wall or fence lengths
- Usage limitations and attribution

  - Additional methodological references detailing habitat classification and reporting frameworks
- Practical considerations for data leaders
  - Useful for assessing national-scale landscape connectivity and habitat feature stocks
  - Provides a clear, non-duplicative basis for aggregating linear features across land classes and regions
  - Metadata and methodological reports support data quality assessment, standardization, and discoverability
  - Be mindful of potential negative LC2007 values; treat as zero in analyses
  - Ensure proper attribution and consult referenced reports for deeper methodological context and data handling rules
