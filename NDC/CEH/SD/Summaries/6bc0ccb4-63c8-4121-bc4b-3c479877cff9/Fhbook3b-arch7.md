# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Provides a national, map-centric field data framework for Great Britain, combining traditional ground-truth mapping with modern GIS practices to support landscape monitoring, biodiversity indicators, and policy/research outputs.
- Emphasises repeatable, auditable data collection across 1 km squares, integrating land cover, habitat, vegetation, soil, and freshwater components.
- Uses standardized codes, parcel-based mapping, and a robust set of plot types to capture vegetation, boundaries, habitat mosaics, and changes over time.

## Sampling design and planning

- Core concept: survey across GB in 1 x 1 km squares, maintaining time-series integrity while adding new data.
- Time-series reporting: squares subdivided into national units; representation adjusted for new habitat classes.
- Upland vs. lowland strategy: distinct plotting approaches (Mappable Broad Habitats in lowland; Plottable Broad Habitats in upland) with targeted plots and upland plots added over time.
- Expansion plans: re-survey of previously visited squares plus additional squares; upland squares include new locations.
- Fieldwork logistics: multi-team deployment, typical square surveys last several days; flexible scheduling to minimise travel time and overtime; old and new squares tracked in a consistent order.

## Equipment and data capture workflow

- Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) central to data capture; comprehensive equipment lists, safety/ID procedures, and strict handling/documentation.
- Data types captured: mapping (main element), vegetation plots, sampling (soil, flora, etc.); GPS data for upland plots; ponds and aerial photo cross-checks.
- Mapping framework: 1:10,000 base maps; three-tier theme maps (physiography, agriculture/vegetation, forestry/boundaries/buildings/roads/recreation) plus a separate Broad Habitat (BAP) map.
- Aerial photography used as guidance and reconciled with ground-truth data.

## Permissions and access

- Landowner consent required for all surveys; proactive communication and documentation of refusals.
- Access rules: abandon an entire square if access is denied to all parts; survey accessible portions if partial access is granted; relocate as needed and document changes.
- Field teams carry ITE identification and landowner information; maintain up-to-date records.

## General data recording and mapping methodologies

- Core components: mapping, plot vegetation recording, and sampling (CS1990 baseline framework used for consistency).
- Mapping approaches:
  - For old squares: changes mapped using CS1990 codes.
  - For new squares: capture full stock of present features.
- Reporting by Broad Habitats: wide habitats mapped via Broad Habitat framework; montane category treated with special considerations.
- Plottable vs. Mappable Broad Habitats:
  - Mappable BAPs: detailed mapping possible (e.g., woodland types, boundaries, arable areas).
  - Plottable BAPs: upland/unenclosed areas mapped with Plottable approach; additional U plots monitor change.
- Plot-based monitoring: additional plots in uplands/peatlands and heaths to track change; expanded plot types to capture habitat variability.

## Plot types and sampling design (CS2000)

- X PLOTS: Areal Large plots (200 m2; often called “Wally” plots) with nested smaller plots; vegetation-focused; fixed layout with marked poles; relocation via metal plates.
- Y PLOTS: Small target plots (2 m x 2 m) in five land-cover types; nested structure with final cover estimates; site sketches required.
- U PLOTS: Unenclosed plots (2 m x 2 m; up to 10 per square) in Plottable Broad Habitats; randomized, habitat-area-based allocation.
- B PLOTS: Boundary plots (5 x 200 m2) at field boundaries; prioritize boundary features; relocation rules for shifting boundaries.
- A PLOTS: Arable field margin plots (100 x 1 m; up to 5 per square) along arable-adjacent boundaries.
- H PLOTS: Hedgerow plots (two 10 m x 1 m per hedgerow; expandable to H3/H4 with hedgerow persistence/change); woody species and canopy structure recorded.
- D PLOTS: Hedgerow Diversity plots (D1–D5): 30 m plots centered on hedgerows; register all woody species within canopy for baseline diversity.
- S & W PLOTS: Streamside and waterside plots (S1–S2; W1–W3): linear plots along watercourses; capture aquatic-adjacent vegetation.
- R & V PLOTS: Roadside and Verge plots (R1–R2; V1–V3): represent road-type variability; spacing and placement rules to avoid clustering.
- Plot relocation: locate original plots with metal plates/plans/photographs; if lost, bury a new plate and record precise location.
- Plot recording: standardized species lists; fixed 5% cover categories; nested plots for X plots; permanent metal plates; GPS where possible; include sketches/photos.

## Vegetation recording and data standards

- Field sheets (9.1–9.115): standardized vegetation forms with a fixed top 200 species; unlisted species recorded with Latin/common names; 5% cover categories; notes for ambiguous identifications.
- Bryophytes and lichens: restricted taxon lists with prescribed cover values.
- Species combinations: allowances for combined identifications where exact species are difficult; use registered combinations when needed.
- Nomenclature and mapping codes: primary/secondary codes; box-based coding to describe mosaics; unique CS1990 codes discouraged unless justified.
- Mapping integration with BAP/universal codes: universal codes (e.g., 555, 999) for special boundary cases; BAP mapping aligned with Montane, Calcareous, Acid, Bracken, Dwarf Shrub Heath, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Bog, Montane, Supra-littoral and Inland Rock groupings.

## Mapping and data integration

- Documentation and parcel-based integration: theme maps, BAP maps, and data forms linked via parcel numbers; changes recorded with new parcel numbers and reflected on maps.
- Change detection workflow: use CS1990 codes for old squares and new parcel numbers for new squares; ensure traceability with mosaics and cross-referenced data forms.
- Ponds and water features: ponds mapped from prior surveys; record pond presence/changes within squares.

## Montane and upland specifics

- Montane Broad Habitat: sub-arctic montane areas mapped de novo; BAP alignment not direct; special considerations for montane translation to BAP categories.
- Upland vs lowland practices: upland habitats largely Plottable Broad Habitats on the agriculture/semi-natural theme map; upland plots supplement with additional U plots to monitor change.

## Quality control, training, and data integrity

- Emphasis on observer standardization to reduce recording variation; dedicated Field Handbook training for consistency.
- Cross-module quality control procedures to maintain data integrity; validation through ground-truthing and integration with remote sensing.

## Annex: GPS data collection (Annex 1)

- Provides step-by-step procedures for GPS use, including battery power, satellite checks, stationary/moving position logging, file naming conventions (e.g., 501X4.PSE), and data logging controls.
- Guidance on PDOP and accuracy considerations; handling obstructions; almanac updates; and battery charging.
- Detailed attribute/reference sheets to expedite plotting and feature naming during fieldwork.

## Section 10 – Sampling

- Three sampling types: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling (the latter by accredited IFE staff).
- Soil sampling goals: provide baseline soil chemistry, LOI, and heavy metal data across GB squares, enabling future soil health indices.
- Sampling design: five replicate soil samples per square per X-plot center; rapid processing of certain samples (soil fauna/microbiology) to preserve integrity; logistics for sending samples to Merlewood.
- Calluna sampling: collection of current-year growth (CYG) shoots for nitrogen deposition analyses.
- Freshwater sampling: coordinated with IFE, timing aligned with survey activities.

## Section 11 – Photography

- Each vegetation plot photographed to document appearance and reference features; photographs tied to square/plot identifiers.
- Guidelines for clear, repeatable imagery: obvious, permanent reference features; avoid excessive sky; ensure legible square/plot labeling on a visible board.

## Section 12 – Procedures after survey

- Post-survey data checks: ensure no features are omitted; reproduce maps/data forms only if essential (to protect original data integrity).
- Transport of FABs and samples to ITE stations arranged promptly.

## Annex 1 – GPS data collection (detailed)

- Battery, satellites, file naming, and data logging steps for robust GPS data capture.
- Emphasis on obtaining a reliable fix (PDOP < ~6 in 3D) and handling obstructions.
- Procedures for stationary vs. moving feature logging and managing data files.

- Overall, CS2000 provides a comprehensive, field-accurate, GIS-focused framework for repeatable national-scale vegetation, habitat, and landscape change monitoring, integrating traditional field methods with modern geospatial practices and standardized data regimes.
