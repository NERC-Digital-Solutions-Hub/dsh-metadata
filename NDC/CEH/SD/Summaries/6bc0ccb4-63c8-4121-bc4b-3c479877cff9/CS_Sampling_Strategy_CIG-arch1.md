# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and approach
  - Describes the field sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Uses the ITE Land Classification as the stratification system to obtain representative, stratified samples of Great Britain’s countryside.
  - Focuses on 1 km square sampling units; aims to support national and country-level estimates of habitats and landscape features and to detect change over time.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representativeness across diverse land types.
  - ITE Land Classification originally created from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to define land classes.
  - Early sampling unit: center square of a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares classified to form strata.
  - National estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per square within each class with the total area of that class.

- Chronology of developments
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification; 1st field survey)
    - 32 land classes (using Indicator Species Analysis and environmental attributes).
    - Sampling: 8 squares per class, total 256 squares; 4 surrounding squares classified around each center square (total classified squares ~6039 km^2).
  - 1984 (2nd field survey)
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (total 384); eight previously visited squares retained.
    - Continued use of the original land classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd field survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square (all-squares approach); some squares reclassified.
    - 508 squares surveyed; added land-cover mapping via satellite data; results published in 1993.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th field survey)
    - Land classification expanded to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
    - 569 squares surveyed; national estimates still based on the revised GB-wide classification.
  - 2000 (CS2000; separate country estimates)
    - Implemented separate country-unit estimates (England with Wales; Scotland).
    - Land Classes subdivided by country units; 40 strata created; 19 additional squares added; some reallocation and aggregation to ensure representation.
    - Wales-specific adjustments introduced to improve country-based estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007; Welsh-only reporting)
    - Wales reporting formalized; added Welsh-specific class sub-divisions (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure representation; some English classes reduced to 4 squares per class.
    - England/Scotland maps updated to reflect revised classifications; Welsh sampling intensified for Wales-only results.
  - Uplands module (CS2000-CS2007)
    - Added an uplands module with 30 extra squares in upland/marginal upland areas of England and Wales to boost accuracy for upland habitats.

- Country reporting and class structure
  - Separate country estimates introduced to reflect policy needs in England, Wales, and Scotland.
  - Welsh sub-classes created to accommodate Wales-specific reporting; Isle of Man squares replaced to maintain country-focused estimates.
  - Class maps and sampling strategy updated accordingly (Figures 4–7 in the document illustrate revised classifications and sampling frameworks).

- National estimates and classification consistency
  - Acknowledges that changing the Land Classification across surveys affects the consistency of national estimates.
  - For a given survey, the latest classification is preferred for internal consistency; older classifications may be used for cross-survey comparability.
  - Table 4 highlights the differences in sample numbers per class under the original (1990) classification versus later classifications.

- Outputs and references
  - CS1990, CS2000, CS2007 reporting progressed with updated land classifications and country-specific estimates.
  - Key publications document methodological developments and the resulting habitat estimates (e.g., CS1990 main report, CS2000, CS2007 Wales reporting).

- Additional context
  - The document traces the historical development of the ITE Land Classification and its application to national ecological surveying since the late 1970s.
  - Appendix and references provide deeper methodological and historical context for researchers and analysts working with long-term ecological time series.
