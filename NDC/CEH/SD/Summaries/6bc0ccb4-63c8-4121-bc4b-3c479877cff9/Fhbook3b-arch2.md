# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Aim and context for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Produce consistent, time-series datasets to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Standardize data collection to ensure outputs (maps, reports, datasets) are comparable across years and observers.
- Create outputs suitable for broader analyses by combining field data with other datasets and enabling data reuse through accessible data management.

## What CS2000 covers and why it matters
- Re-surveys CS1990 to update land cover, landscape features, and vegetation data across Great Britain.
- Data support government and agency policy obligations (biodiversity action plans, sustainable development indicators, rural policy, etc.).
- Repeat sampling aims to detect change over time and to link ground-truth field data with remote sensing for policy-relevant indicators.

## Sampling framework and planning
- Builds on CS1990; core 508 squares expanded to 568 squares with country-unit considerations and class subdivisions.
- Six survey teams, each handling ~95 squares; typical survey duration per square around four days.
- Planning prioritizes minimal travel, consistent timing, and continuity of time-series by re-surveying older squares and matching new squares with nearby existing ones.
- Special focus on upland and enclosed landscapes; additional squares to improve upland representation.

## Field operations and logistics
- Flexible planning, travel logistics, and safety considerations; landowner permissions required; pre-survey letters and on-site checks; phased responses to access refusals.
- Equipment and safety gear provided; station coordinators manage fleet and care of gear.

## Data recording and data quality (FAB-based system)
- Core elements: mapping, vegetation plots, and sampling.
- Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) combine maps and codes; emphasis on neat, standardized entries and documentation of changes or uncertainties.
- Standard code sets for land cover, vegetation, and features; user-defined codes allowed with guidelines to minimize ad hoc coding.

## Mapping methodology and change detection
- Two main approaches:
  - Change detection in CS1990 squares (changes since 1990).
  - De novo mapping in new squares (full stock of land cover/features).
- Reporting aligns with Broad Habitats (BAP) for biodiversity objectives; some upland/montane habitats require de novo mapping.
- Two-tier approach: Mappable Broad Habitats (defined boundaries) vs Plottable Broad Habitats (less regular boundaries with plots for monitoring change).
- Lowland enclosed landscapes emphasize de novo mapping; upland/unenclosed landscapes emphasize plot-based change detection.
- Ponds may be tracked with a dedicated ponds map where appropriate.

## Plot types and sampling design
- X PLOTS (AREAL or WALLY PLOTS): 200 m² main plots; nested 4 m² inner plots for detailed composition.
- Y PLOTS (SMALL/HABITAT PLOTS): five 2 m × 2 m plots per square for baseline vegetation and change detection.
- U PLOTS (UNENCLOSED): up to 10 plots in unenclosed habitats with Plottable Broad Habitats present.
- B PLOTS (BOUNDARY PLOTS): five 200 m² plots at field boundaries for boundary vegetation.
- A PLOTS (ARABLE FIELD MARGIN PLOTS): five 100 m × 1 m plots along arable margins.
- H & D PLOTS (HEDGEROW & HEDGEROW DIVERSITY): hedgerow plots and diversity plots for woody vegetation.
- S & W PLOTS (STREAMSIDE): streams/ditches edges sampling with 5 plots (two S-type, three W-type).
- R & V PLOTS (ROADSIDE & VERGE): roadside/edge vegetation sampling with five plots.
- Plots are marked for relocation; each plot type has placement rules, sizes, and documentation requirements.

## Data capture in vegetation surveys
- Nested plots record vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens with predefined cover categories.
- Areal plots capture presence and abundance; nested plots enable detailed composition and total cover estimation.
- Unlisted species can be added; standardized species lists (approximately 200 common species) are used; combinations/aggregations allowed under rules.
- Bryophytes and lichens tracked from defined lists with guidance for mosaics and special cases.

## Technology, standards, and integration
- GPS used for upland plot relocation; relays on metal plates, field plans, and GPS when available.
- OS maps and aerial imagery integrated; API-derived conventions are guidance rather than mandatory.
- Data continuity with CS1990 maintained; new data linked to existing datasets for time-series analyses and policy indicators.
- Emphasis on observer standardization and documented Field Handbook guidance to minimize variation.

## Permissions and field ethics
- Access and permissions essential; inform and consult landowners, farmers, and agents.
- If access is denied for a square, fieldwork may be terminated or replaced; partial access requires special handling to maximize usable data.

## Annexes and additional guidelines
- Annex 1: Collecting GPS data (field relocation, especially upland plots).
- Guidelines cover boundary management, boundary types, boundary condition codes, curtilage, and mapping/coding conventions to ensure cross-year consistency.

## End goals and implications for analysts
- Produce high-quality, comparable time-series data to support:
  - Analyses of land cover and landscape change over time.
  - Monitoring of Broad Habitats and their responses to policy and management.
  - Integration with biodiversity action plans and European/National policy frameworks.
- Promote transparency, documentation of change, and cross-year comparability through standardized methods, plots, and data codes.
- Increase the value and accessibility of datasets to support robust environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

## 10. Sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater)
- Three sampling types within CS2000: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling (the latter by accredited IFE staff).
- Soil sampling provides baseline data for soil health indicators (pH, organic matter, heavy metals) supporting soil sustainability assessments.

### Background
- Soil health indices require baseline, strategically collected data; five replicate soil samples per square from the same CS1990 squares are collected and analyzed by ITE Merlewood.

### Collection and distribution
- Five soil cores collected per X-plot: three deep cores and two shallow cores; samples sent to ITE Merlewood with standardized packaging and labeling.
- Specific equipment and packaging instructions ensure traceability and proper handling.

### Sampling procedure
- Detailed steps for collecting soil samples at the center of each X-plot, including positioning, depth, and handling to preserve sample integrity.
- Protocols for packing, labeling, and posting samples to ITE Merlewood; procedures for quick processing of short-shelf-life samples.

### Calluna sampling
- Calluna foliar nitrogen sampling correlates with nitrogen deposition; samples collected from Calluna vulgaris within squares to assess nitrogen deposition impacts.

### Freshwater sampling
- Freshwater sampling conducted by IFE-accredited staff; coordination with CS2000 field teams to schedule compatible sampling times.

## Photography
- Cameras provided; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and context relative to landmarks.
- Reference features must be obvious, stable, and visible in future visits.
- Photos labeled with square/plot identifiers and positioned using a marker board; composition aims to include plot foreground with reference features.

## Procedures after survey
- Post-survey data checks to ensure no data were omitted.
- Transcription to fresh maps/maps should only be used if original data are damaged; FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE stations promptly.

## Annex: GPS data collection (collecting GPS data)
- Step-by-step guidance for battery management, satellite checks, stationary vs moving data collection, file naming (square and plot identifiers), sampling rate, feature naming, and logging controls.
- Guidance on minimizing PDOP-related errors, ensuring clear sky view, and handling GPS equipment.

## Attribute reference and reference sheets
- Provides quick-reference schemes to input plot identifiers and features during GPS data collection to streamline field data recording.
