# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Long-running field survey framework for Countryside Survey; latest in a 30-year evolution of the ITE Land Classification (ILT) used to stratify GB for ecological and land-use sampling.
  - Aims to provide representative, time-series data on habitat areas and land use to support policy, planning, and ecological assessments.

- ITE Land Classification (ILT): core data framework
  - Initially produced 32 Land Classes by grouping squares based on environmental attributes; used to stratify sampling.
  - Classes describe broad ecological variation (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to ensure representative coverage.
  - Over time, ILT evolved to support country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and upland analyses; later versions expanded to around 40–45 classes.

- Survey design and sampling framework across key years
  - CS1978 (Initial survey)
    - Basic ILT stratification with 8 sample squares per Land Class; total of 256 field squares.
    - National habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square × area of each Land Class.
  - CS1984 (Second survey)
    - Increased sampling to 12 squares per Land Class (total 384); aimed to improve national estimates.
  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd survey)
    - ILT revised to classify all 1 km squares in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - National estimates aligned with the 1990 Land Classification; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
  - CS2000 (4th survey)
    - Revisions to enable separate England & Wales and Scotland reporting; introduced country-unit versions of Land Classes (creating 40 strata).
    - Added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; additional Wales-focused sampling to improve Wales reporting; upland habitats module added to boost upland estimates.
  - CS2007 (5th survey)
    - Wales-specific reporting needs driven further changes; Welsh classes subdivided (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Added 43 Welsh squares to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class; some English classes (5e, 15e) left with 4 squares due to precision considerations.
    - Welsh-focused upland sampling adjustments continued to improve country-specific precision.
    - England-Wales and Scotland revised land-class maps used for sampling framework; Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country in relative terms.
  - Upland module
    - Additional module in CS2000 added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland ILT contexts to improve habitat estimates for uplands in England and Wales.

- Country-specific reporting and regional considerations
  - Separate country estimates implemented to deliver England & Wales vs. Scotland (and later Wales-specific outputs).
  - ILT classes subdivided by country unit; where necessary, small class representations in a country were aggregated with similar classes to maintain robust estimates.
  - Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with new English squares to preserve country-focused statistics.

- Data outputs, documentation, and dissemination
  - Tables summarize the number of squares per class and per survey year; maps illustrate the revised ILT distributions and sample locations.
  - Results published in series of countryside survey reports across years (CS1990 main report; CS2000 and CS2007 UK results; individual country-focused outputs).
  - Emphasis on provenance, year-specific classifications, and methodological changes to support traceability and time-series comparability.

- Data governance and stewardship considerations
  - Versioning and lineage of the Land Classification are critical for consistent time-series interpretation; must document changes in classification, class definitions, and country-unit adjustments.
  - Metadata should capture survey year, country-unit scope, class subdivisions (e.g., 5e vs. 5w), and any upland modules added.
  - Data products must preserve linkages between sample squares, class areas, and habitat estimates; include notes on reclassification impacts on representation and estimates.
  - Acknowledge limitations and precision changes when classes are subdivided or sample sizes vary by country (e.g., Wales having more dense sampling but English classes with reduced counts).
  - Data sharing should include access to historical classifications and accompanying methodological documentation to enable cross-year analyses.

- Challenges and considerations for data stewards
  - Ensuring temporal consistency while accommodating devolved governance needs (England, Wales, Scotland) and policy-driven reporting requirements.
  - Balancing representation across an expanding set of Land Classes with finite sampling capacity, especially for Wales and upland habitats.
  - Managing updates to the sampling framework (e.g., medium-term class redefinitions, new country-unit subdivisions) without compromising comparability with earlier surveys.
  - Providing clear guidance on how to derive national or country-specific estimates from the latest classification vs. original classifications, including implications for cross-survey comparability.
