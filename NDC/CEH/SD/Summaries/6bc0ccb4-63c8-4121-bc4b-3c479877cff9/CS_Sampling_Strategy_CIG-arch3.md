# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Demonstrates the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its use as a framework for nationwide ecological sampling and policy-relevant habitat estimation.
  - Aims to show how sampling design supports robust national, regional, and country-specific environmental estimates.

- Core concepts and rationale
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative sampling across diverse land types.
  - Use of the ITE Land Classification to stratify GB land into discrete classes (originally 32, later expanded to around 40–45 to allow country-specific reporting).
  - Requirement to translate class-level sampling into national habitat estimates (area of habitat per class times total class area).

- Evolution of the sampling framework (timeline)
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to define 32 land classes from environmental data on 1 km squares.
    - Sampled 8 squares per class (256 total) from classified squares; habitat areas estimated per class and scaled to national totals.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Sample increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (384 total); continuity with 1978 framework; national estimates updated.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd field survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; results published for CS1990 (1993).
  - 1998/2000 (Revised Land Classification; 4th field survey)
    - Introduction of a GB-wide classification capable of Scotland reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
    - CS2000 added country-unit reporting (England with Wales, and Scotland) with 40 strata; additional squares deployed to improve representation.
    - Separate country estimates module implemented; uplands module introduced to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
  - 2007 (Revised Land Classification; 5th field survey)
    - Wales-specific reporting formalized; Wales gains its own strata (Welsh sub-divisions 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing total strata to around 45.
    - Increased Welsh sampling to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class; England adjustments due to removal of Welsh squares; overall Wales-focused sampling enhancements.
    - England, Scotland, and Wales sampling maps updated to reflect revised country-specific frameworks.

- Data design and outputs
  - Sampling is organized by Land Classes to enable estimation of habitat areas and land-use features.
  - National estimates are derived by: mean habitat area per square in each Land Class × land area of that class.
  - Outputs include tabular summaries of square counts by class and country, and maps of the sampling framework and sample locations.
  - Separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) require re-classification and recalibration to maintain comparability over time.

- Wales and uplands focus
  - Wales required more granular, Wales-specific class subdivisions and dedicated sampling to provide reliable Wales-only habitat estimates.
  - An uplands module expanded CS2000 to 30 additional squares in upland/marginal upland Land Classes to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats.

- Challenges and methodological notes
  - Changing Land Class definitions affect the consistency of national estimates; trade-offs between using the latest classification for internal survey consistency vs. cross-survey comparability.
  - Balancing representation across England, Scotland, and Wales; ensuring adequate squares per class in each country.
  - Metadata, data sharing, and reproducibility considerations embedded in the framework; data continue to inform policy and environmental monitoring.

- Supporting references and outputs
  - Foundational reports documenting methodology and results:

  - Figures and tables summarize the land classifications, sampling maps, and class distributions across survey years.
