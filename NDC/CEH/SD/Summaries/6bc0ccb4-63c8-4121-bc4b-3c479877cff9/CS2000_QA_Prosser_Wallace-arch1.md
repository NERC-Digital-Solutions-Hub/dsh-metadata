# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- A quality assurance (QA) exercise assessed the CS2000 field program to measure consistency and reliability across key components: plot relocation, species records, vegetation cover, landuse mapping, change detection, and boundary features.

## Aims
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in CS2000 and comment on change statistics.
- Examine plot relocation efficiency.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, plot location/orientation, and management/seasonal effects.
- Relate recording accuracy to CS1990 CS surveys for comparison.

## Methods and Scope
- Selected 38 of 519 squares; one quarter of each square resurveyed (234 species plots across nine plot types).
- Rechecked location of plots and landcover codes; compared CS2000 field data with QA assessments.
- Assessed plot relocation (plates and plots), species concordance, vegetation cover, landcover mapping, and change recording.
- Plots included quadrats, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, and hedge diversity plots.

## Key Findings

- Plot relocation
  - 210 plots searched; 86.7% successfully relocated by assessors (28 not satisfactorily relocated).
  - CS2000 surveyors relocated 60% of 1990 plots precisely; ~25% more or less relocated; ~15% poorly relocated.
  - Y-plots (4 m Habitat Plots) had the highest relocation failure at 23%.
  - Eight-year relocation is possible as with one-year QA, but effectiveness varied by plot type.

- Species concordance and recording accuracy
  - Approximately 6,000 records across 210 plots; 71% confirmed by QA as present; ~2% due to real management/seasonal changes.
  - Initial recording accuracy around 73%, with ~5% reduction attributed to plot-location errors.
  - CS2000 mean species per plot: 17.9; QA mean: 20.4; overall agreement across all plots ~87.7% (CS2000 vs QA).
  - Across major plot types, axis scores in a DECORANA ordination showed no directional bias between CS2000 and QA; mean axis 1 scores were similar (no significant difference; p ≈ 0.847 overall).

- Vegetation cover
  - For the 30 most frequent, cover values showed substantial agreement but some significant differences for grasses and grass-like species (seasonal effects suspected for several).
  - Notable discrepancies included mis-matches among certain grasses and some over- or under-estimated covers; some differences likely due to season and search intensity.

- Changes in species frequency and composition
  - Across plot types, a continuum analysis (based on DECORANA axis 1) showed changes in axis scores with no strong directional bias; most discrepancies due to plot location/orientation or cover value differences.
  - Major sources of error were location/orientation of plots and mis-matches in cover assignment, rather than genuine systematic change.
  - Change concurrence (CS2000 vs QA) averaged ~51.4%; changes not noted by CS2000 ~33.9%; changes recorded but not substantiated by QA ~14.7%.
  - A substantial portion of changes since 1990 may have been missed; reliance on plot data for change evaluation is important.

- Landcover mapping and codes
  - Primary land cover codes: high concordance between CS2000 and QA; overall primary land cover agreement excluding BAP codes ~87.5%; concordance ~91.6% for primary codes when BAP is excluded.
  - BAP (broad habitat) codes: agreement ~77.4%, reducing overall primary land cover concordance when included.
  - Landcover change coding (1990 vs 2000) showed moderate to low concordance for changes, with substantial discrepancies between CS2000 and QA in reported changes.

- Boundary features and hedges
  - Primary boundary code concordance overall ~92.0% with 85.0% total concordance; some mis-coding, notably around mixed hedges (code 323) and occasional changes where a feature no longer existed.
  - Boundary height and stockproof status showed high concordance (boundary height ~92.8% code concordance; stockproof ~89.4%).
  - Hedge shapes and boundary descriptions had somewhat lower agreement (67.5% overall for hedge-related codes).

- Hedge diversity plots
  - Total species recorded: 124; common species 92; overall agreement ~74.2%; surveyor efficiency ~77.4%.
  - Hedge plots were occasionally treated as afterthoughts, leading to relatively higher omissions in hedge coding.

- Arable plots
  - Only five arable margin plots; concordance in species between CS2000 and QA was very low (about 30.6% agreement on species between TI and T2).
  - Seasonality and ruderal species likely contributed to high mis-match; two visits per site suggested for future arable margin work.

- Species cover at landuse sample points
  - Overall cover concordance ~74.4% for cases where both parties assigned the same species at the same location.
  - Some species (e.g., Lolium perenne) showed higher agreement; others (e.g., Poa trivialis, Anthoxanthum odoratum) showed lower agreement, influenced by seasonal changes and identification challenges.

- Changes in land-use codes
  - Change concordance in land-use strings ~51.4%; many changes not noted by CS2000 or not substantiated by QA.
  - A notable proportion of identified changes likely reflect interpretive coding issues or mis-codings rather than real landscape changes.

## Mapping and Coding Details

- Primary land cover codes
  - High overall concordance between CS2000 and QA; minor mis-matches due to specific code choices (e.g., grasses coded as different land types).
- BAP codes
  - Good concordance, but more challenge in distinguishing some habitat transitions; boundaries between BAP types were sometimes inadequately updated.
- Primary boundary codes and boundary features
  - Strong concordance for boundary presence and height; some discrepancies in hedge-type coding and boundary changes.
- Change and boundary mapping
  - Change recording showed substantial room for improvement; the QA suggested focusing on consistent, repeatable documentation of actual changes rather than inferred changes.

## Overall Conclusions

- CS2000 fieldwork showed strong reliability in plot relocation and species recording, with high cross-compare agreement to QA findings and no evident directional bias in the data.
- Landcover mapping and boundary coding were generally robust, with high concordance for primary codes and boundary features; BAP coding and some hedge-related codes showed more variability.
- Change detection between 1990 and 2000 had the lowest concordance, with many changes either missed or inconsistently recorded, highlighting a need for careful interpretation and possibly more rigorous change-logging methods.
- For certain habitat types, especially arable margins and small or complex hedge features, QA results suggest additional field visits or refined methods to improve data reliability.
- Overall, CS2000 data are largely reliable for broad habitat categorization and trend assessment, but improvements in change documentation, plot relocation verification, and arable-margin recording would enhance future surveys.
