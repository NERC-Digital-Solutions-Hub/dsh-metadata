# THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

- Overview
  - Long-running methodology for field surveys in Countryside Survey (CS) linking sampling to the ITE Land Classification.
  - Emphasizes stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage and time-series comparability.
  - Data strategy focuses on classifying every square, guiding sample allocation, and enabling national, regional, and country-specific estimates of habitat and land-use features.

- Core Concepts
  - Stratification to reduce bias and ensure representative coverage across diverse landscapes.
  - Use of the ITE Land Classification to define strata and drive sampling design.
  - Time-series approach: successive CS surveys build on earlier classifications and sampling frameworks to detect change.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and CS Sampling (by survey year)
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
    - 32 land classes; sample unit of 1 km2; 8 samples per class; total 256 squares.
    - Centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid used; four surrounding squares also classified.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total).
    - Estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification framework.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification updated to classify every 1 km square in GB (1989–1990 revision).
    - 508 squares surveyed; added land-use and habitat mapping; repeat vegetation quadrats.
    - Results published as Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification & 4th Field Survey)
    - Land Classification updated to support Scotland-only reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
    - 569 squares surveyed; results published.
  - 2000 (Developments for CS2000)
    - Framework adjustments to enable separate country reporting (England with Wales, and Scotland).
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; total strata increased to 40 or 45.
    - Additional samples added to ensure adequate representation, including upland habitats; IOM sampling modified.
  - 2007 (Developments for CS2007)
    - Wales-focused reporting prompts further Wales- and England-specific class subdivisions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Strata increased to 45; 43 Welsh additional squares allocated; minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class.
    - England retains sufficient samples in most classes; two English classes may have as few as 4 squares.
    - Welsh uplands module added (30 extra squares) for better country-wide upland estimates.
  
- Land Classification Details (key progression)
  - 32 classes originally; by 1990/1998 expanded to 40 classes.
  - 2000/2007 introduced country-unit subdivisions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to enable England & Wales vs Scotland reporting.
  - Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates; replaced by additional England samples.
  - Wales-specific refinements increased sampling in Welsh classes to improve Wales-only estimates.

- Sampling Framework and Data Side of Things
  - Sample design
    - Each class (stratum) is sampled from GB-wide maps; initial target of eight samples per class (CS1978).
    - 1978: 256 squares across 32 classes; method extended to cover surrounding areas for each center square.
    - 1984: sample size per class increased by 50% to 12 squares; integration with existing 1984 data.
    - 1990: full GB-wide classification allows all squares to be classified; 508 squares surveyed.
  - National estimates approach
    - Estimates of habitat areas derived from the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the land area of that class.
    - When classifications shift across surveys, national estimates may vary due to the classification system rather than real changes in land cover.
    - For consistency, national GB estimates typically use the latest classification framework, while older classifications are used for cross-survey comparisons when needed.
  - Country-specific reporting
    - From CS2000 onward, adaptations enable England & Wales and Scotland-specific reporting.
    - Wales receives dedicated sampling to enable Wales-only reporting; Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates.
  - Upland and additional modules
    - CS2000 upland habitat module adds 30 extra squares in upland contexts for England and Wales, improving precision for upland estimates.
  
- Outputs and Data Governance Points
  - Results are tied to the Land Classification framework; changes in classification affect comparability and national estimates across surveys.
  - References and main reports articulate how classifications map to survey results and how country-unit estimates are constructed.
  - The approach supports monitoring change over time and informs policy-relevant environmental reporting.

- Notable Figures and Tables (conceptual)
  - Table and figure references outline the progression of sample counts, strata definitions, and land-class maps across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
  - Examples include total squares surveyed per survey, class counts, and country-specific sampling rates.
  - Illustrative notes discuss the implications of classification changes on estimate consistency and interpretation.

- Practical Takeaways for Data Leaders
  - Stratal design and stratified random sampling are central to producing representative, time-series data.
  - Consistent classification frameworks are critical for comparability; when classifications update, they influence national estimates and require careful communication about changes.
  - Country-unit reporting requires explicit class subdivisions and targeted sampling to ensure precision, particularly for Wales and upland regions.
  - Additional modules (e.g., uplands) can be added to improve statistical accuracy for specific contexts.
  - Data governance needs to account for changes in classification, sample allocation, and cross-survey comparability to maintain a coherent, actionable data governance narrative.
