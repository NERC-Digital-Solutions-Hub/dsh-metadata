# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2)

- Context: The p4ges project in Madagascar investigates paying for global ecosystem services to reduce poverty, with WP4 focused on carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ). The manual documents the second step of the survey, emphasizing belowground/root biomass (BGB) and its contribution to total forest carbon, addressing its traditional underestimation and importance for carbon budgeting and REDD+ relevance.

- Aim
  - Quantify belowground/root biomass (BGB) for five IPCC pools, with special focus on BGB in CAZ.
  - Generate accurate BGB estimates at the tree level (kg.tree-1) to support development of allometric equations for stand-level (Mg.ha-1) carbon stock.
  - Compare direct measurement methods and establish field-ready procedures for root biomass assessment (stump, CR, MR, FR) and assess their implications for carbon accounting.

- Study Area
  - Humid tropical forest in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena corridor (CAZ), eastern Madagascar.
  - Area: ~370,032 ha; four zones of interest (ZOIs): Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4).
  - ZOIs chosen based on biophysical criteria (altitude, slope, soil, climate), deforestation history, and accessibility.

- Process for Selecting Target Trees
  - Focus on the closed-canopy land use type; destructive measurement requires selecting representative target trees.
  - Used inventory data (species, DBH classes, height) and allometry for AGB to identify zones/sites with representative biomass.
  - Two ZOIs retained for direct BGB measurements (ZOI3 Anjahamana and ZOI2 Andasibe) based on stand-level AGB values.
  - Site selection aimed to reflect DBH class contributions to site biomass; at least 3 sites per ZOI were chosen for BGB measurements.
  - Target trees: 54 total (two ZOIs × three sites per ZOI × three species per site × three DBH classes per species), spanning large (DBH ≥ 20 cm), medium (10 ≤ DBH < 20 cm), and small (5 ≤ DBH < 10 cm).

- Field Methods for Root Biomass Estimation
  - Two main methods used:
    - Voronoi polygon method
      - Concept: delineate root influence areas around each target tree based on relative tree sizes and neighboring trees; roots outside polygon balanced by those inside.
      - Experimental design: target tree plus up to four neighboring trees; record DBH and height; measure distances; compute polygon area via triangulation; collect and weigh root samples by category and soil horizon; separate stump.
      - Root categories collected: FR (Fine Roots), MR (Medium Roots), CR (Coarse Roots), plus CR0 (above-soil portion).
    - Pits method
      - Design: three 1 m² pits arranged at the vertices of an equilateral triangle around the target tree, 10 m from the center; roots excavated by category and depth; similar collection and weighting as Voronoi method.
      - Noted potential biases: pit method can underestimate BGB in humid tropical forests.
  - Field data management: roots washed, weighed, samples collected for lab analysis; ramification measurements (length, diameters, mean diameters, and weight) performed to improve accuracy.

- Laboratory Work
  - Oven-dried root samples: 75°C until constant weight (typical 48 hours for FR/MR; longer for CR and stump).
  - Dry weights used to calculate total tree-level root biomass; samples also used for meta-analysis and development of allometric relationships.

- Calculation of Root Biomass and Aboveground Biomass
  - Root biomass:
    - For Voronoi method: total root biomass per tree derived from sum of weights across root categories and soil horizons within the polygon area. Area calculations based on triangulated polygon geometry.
    - For pits method: similar aggregation from pit excavations; acknowledged potential underestimation in humid tropical forests.
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB):
    - Direct measurement of AGB components (trunk, leaves, branches) from target trees.
    - AGB at tree level estimated using allometric equation CHAVE et al. 2014: AGB = 0.0673 × (WSG^0.976 × DBH^2 × H)^0.976 (or equivalent form as per equation provided).
    - Stand-level AGB per site calculated by summing tree-level AGB and upscaling to per-hectare basis.

- Data Management and Outputs
  - All generated datasets from the methodology (field and lab data) archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
  - Aim to publish and share all data to underpin robust allometric models for BGB and AGB; data governance, quality, and openness emphasized through archival practice.

- Conclusions and Implications
  - The WP4 effort advances direct measurement of belowground carbon pools in a humid tropical forest, addressing a historically under-sampled component (BGB) and informing carbon stock assessments within REDD+ frameworks.
  - The work supports development of species- and site-specific allometric models for root biomass and contributes to improved carbon accounting for CAZ and similar tropical forests.
