# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2)

- Context and aim
  - The p4ges project in Madagascar seeks to influence the design and implementation of payments for ecosystem services at an international scale to alleviate poverty.
  - WP4-carbon focuses on carbon stock assessment, with particular emphasis on belowground/root biomass (BGB) within the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ) in eastern Madagascar.
  - Objectives include direct measurement of BGB on selected trees, comparison of BGB quantification methods, calculation of BGB per tree to develop allometric models for stand-level carbon, and integration with existing aboveground biomass (AGB) data.

- Study area and sampling design
  - Location: humid tropical forest in CAZ, eastern Madagascar, spanning about 370,032 hectares.
  - Zone of Interest (ZOI): Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4).
  - ZOIs were selected based on biophysical criteria (altitude, slope, climate, soil, deforestation history, access) and initial AGB density assessments.
  - Four ZOIs were evaluated; two (Anjahamana and Andasibe) were prioritized for direct BGB measurements due to biomass density and access considerations.
  - Site and target tree selection
    - Direct BGB measurements focused on closed-canopy land use across the four ZOIs.
    - Sites were chosen to reflect AGB density and the representation across DBH classes (large: DBH ≥ 20 cm; medium: 10 ≤ DBH < 20 cm; small: 5 ≤ DBH < 10 cm).
    - At least 3 sites per ZOI were selected for BGB measurements, balancing access and protected-area constraints.
    - Target trees were drawn from dominant species, selecting up to three species per site and incorporating three DBH classes, resulting in 54 target trees total for direct BGB measurement.

- Field methods for belowground biomass (BGB)
  - Two main methods used to estimate BGB around target trees:
    - Voronoï polygon method
      - Uses a simplified Voronoï partition around the target tree to allocate root space among neighboring trees.
      - Design includes recording target and neighboring trees (species, DBH, height) and distances to neighbors.
      - Calculation involves delimiting polygon boundaries and collecting root samples within defined triangles; roots are categorized as stump, coarse roots (CR, ≥10 mm), medium roots (MR, 2–10 mm), and fine roots (FR, <2 mm) across soil horizons (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm; CR0 included).
      - Root components are weighed in the field and samples taken for lab analysis.
      - Ramifications (root branches) of CR are characterized by length, diameters, and weights to improve allometric estimates.
    - Pits method
      - Excavates roots in three 1 m² pits arranged in a triangle around the target tree (center), with 10 m distance to vertices and 120° angles.
      - Roots are sorted into FR, MR, CR, weighed, and sampled for lab analysis.
      - Considered as a supplementary method and noted to potentially underestimate BGB in humid tropical forests.
  - Field data collection details
    - Target tree identification and neighbor enumeration guided by prior inventories.
    - Parameters recorded: species, DBH, height, and distances to neighboring trees.
    - In Voronoï method, the final polygon delimitation is derived from calculated fractions of neighbor influence and intersecting triangles.
    - For each triangle/area, area and geometry are used to compute the sampled volume for biomass estimation.

- Root biomass laboratory work
  - Samples dried in an oven at 75°C until constant weight (typical 48 hours for FR/MR; longer for CR and stump).
  - Oven-dried weights are used to compute total dry root biomass per target tree.
  - Root components from field measurements are weighed and combined to yield tree-level BGB.

- Aboveground biomass (AGB) data collection
  - AGB components (trunk, branches, leaves) of the target trees were measured directly in the field at slaughter.
  - This direct AGB dataset complements BGB measurements and supports development of comprehensive allometric models.

- Data processing and modeling
  - Purpose: derive root biomass at tree level and develop allometric equations for BGB and stand-level C stocks (Mg ha⁻¹).
  - AGB at tree level is estimated using a modern allometry equation (Chave et al., 2014) based on DBH and biomass-related variables, enabling upscaling to per-site and per-hectare values.
  - BGB at tree level is calculated from field measurements (Voronoï or pits) and lab-dried weights; area and geometry from Voronoï polygons inform the spatially explicit sampling.
  - The study area’s BGB data will feed into allometry models for scalable carbon stock estimation and support REDD+ monitoring in Madagascar.

- Data management and outputs
  - All datasets generated by the methodology are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
  - The project aims to publish allometric models for root biomass and aboveground biomass, contributing to improved carbon stock inventories in humid Malagasy forests.

- Key conclusions and relevance
  - The root biomass component is significant for total forest carbon and must be explicitly quantified to improve carbon stock assessments.
  - Direct BGB measurements and method comparisons (Voronoï vs. pits) provide robust data to refine allometric equations and enable reliable stand-level carbon estimates.
  - The work supports sustainable ecosystem service management and REDD+ initiatives in Madagascar.

- References and supporting context
  - The manual cites foundational studies on root biomass, allometric modeling, and root measurement methodologies, and notes that the dataset will underpin ongoing carbon stock assessments and model development.
