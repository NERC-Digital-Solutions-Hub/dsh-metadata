    - Type: Numeric
    - Unit: Numeric
  - Distance between picket
    - Information: Distance between two neighbouring pickets
    - Type: Numeric
    - Unit: Meter
  - Height of each triangle
    - Information: Height used for each triangle formed with two neighbouring pickets
    - Type: Numeric
    - Unit: (Noted as numeric; unit not consistently specified)
  - Base of each triangle
    - Information: Base length of each triangle
    - Type: Numeric
    - Unit: Meter
  - Area of each triangle
    - Information: Area of each triangle
    - Type: Numeric

- Geometry and delimitation context
  - The target tree forms a triangle with two neighbouring pickets; triangle height, base, and area are recorded to support Voronoi-based delimitation.
  - Distances to neighbouring trees and to pickets, along with DBH-based size metrics, feed spatial relationships used in map-enabled analyses.

- Usage considerations for GIS specialists
  - Data are designed to support map-based visualization of tree environments and spatial delimitation boundaries (Voronoi polygons).
  - Consistent coding of target tree in the Code field aids integration with other datasets.
  - Coordinate with data collection methods (pickets, relative distances, and neighbour information) to ensure accurate spatial representation in GIS workflows.
  - Acknowledge data origin when producing products.
