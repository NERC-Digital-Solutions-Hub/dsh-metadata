## How This Supports Environmental Monitoring
- Standardized variables enable consistent reporting of root biomass and carbon stocks across sites and subplots.
- Enables calculation and mapping of belowground carbon pools for environmental health assessments and policy performance monitoring.
- Designed for storage and upload to appropriate data portals to facilitate reuse and transparency.

## Data Quality, Reuse, and Accessibility
- Emphasizes verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation of data prior to analysis.
- Focuses on making underlying data accessible to others to enhance value and reuse of monitoring datasets.
