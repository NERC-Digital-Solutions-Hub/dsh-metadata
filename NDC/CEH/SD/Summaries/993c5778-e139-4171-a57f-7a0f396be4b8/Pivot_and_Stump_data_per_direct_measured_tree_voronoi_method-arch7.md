# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Pivot_and_Stump_data_per_direct_measured_tree_voronoi_method.csv

## Overview
- Records information on stump, pivot (taproot), and surface roots of directly measured trees.
- Pivot defined as the vertical taproot at the base of the target tree; stump is the portion between the above-ground cut point and the below-ground root delineation.
- After felling, the stump is cut and the taproot is excavated and weighed.
- Associated with the ESPA Programme and P4GES project; acknowledgement required for derived products.

## Spatial, location, and identifiers
- ZOI (Zone of Interest): Categorical information (e.g., ZOI2 Andasibe, ZOI3 Anjahamana); Unit not specified.
- Location: Name of sampling point (text string; Unit not specified).
- Site_Id: Code for the site where the target tree was collected (text string).
- Local_name: Vernacular/local name of the target tree (text string).
- Code_target_tree: Code for each target tree, linking to site, species name, and diameter class (text string).

## Measured weight variables (in grams)
- Weight_Freshtotal_Pivot: Fresh total weight of Pivot (taproot).
- Weight_Freshsample_Pivot: Fresh weight of Pivot sample.
- Weight_Drysample_Pivot: Dry weight of Pivot sample.
- Weight_Freshtotal_Stump: Fresh total weight of Stump.
- Weight_Freshsample_Stump: Fresh weight of Stump sample.
- Weight_Drysample_Stump: Dry weight of Stump sample.
- Weight_Freshtotal_CR0: Fresh total weight of coarse roots found above soil (CR0).
- Weight_Freshsample_CR0: Fresh weight of CR0 sample.
- Weight_Drysample_CR0: Dry weight of CR0 sample.
