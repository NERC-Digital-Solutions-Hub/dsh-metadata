# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Root_carbon_stock_per_direct_measured_tree_pit_method.csv Please also see Manual_2_Belowground_Root_Survey

## What this dataset contains
- Biomass and carbon stock of tree roots measured directly via a tree pit method.
- Data described by: site_ID, Subplot, Category_root, Biomasse (root biomass), Root_C_Stock (root carbon stock).
- Biomass unit: Milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1); Carbon stock unit: Mg.ha-1.
- Subplot indicates the sampling location (S1, S2, S3, S4); Category_root differentiates root type (Coarse Root CR or Medium Root MR).

## Key fields and definitions
- site_ID: P4GES WP4 site code; Information describes tracking, Variable Type is a Text String.
- Subplot: Categorical; Unit: S1/S2/S3/S4; Information specifies the subplot where the sample was collected.
- Category_root: Categorical; Unit: CR, MR; Information specifies root category (Coarse or Medium).
- Biomasse: Numeric; Information = Biomass stock of Roots.
- Root_C_Stock: Numeric; Information = Carbon stock of Roots.

## Data provenance and access

## Usage notes and considerations
- Data are designed to enable exploration and self-serve analysis of root biomass and carbon stock across sites (P4GES WP4).
- Be mindful of unit labeling inconsistencies (Biomasse described as Milligrams per hectare; check for alignment with Mg.ha-1 conventions during integration).
- Refer to the associated manual (Manual_2_Belowground_Root_Survey) for methodological details.
