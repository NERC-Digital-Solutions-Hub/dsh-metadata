# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2)

- Context and Aims
  - Project aims to quantify carbon stocks in the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ) eastern Madagascar, focusing on the belowground biomass (BGB) as a key carbon pool alongside the five IPCC pools.
  - BGB is substantial and often under-studied; this manual develops in-depth root biomass measurement (including stump, coarse, medium, and fine roots) to improve direct estimation and enable later allometric modeling for stand-level carbon stock.
  - Outputs include data collection and processing to develop allometric equations for BGB and to complement aboveground biomass (AGB) assessments; datasets are archived for reuse and REDD+ relevance.
  - Collaboration with CIRAD and ESSA-Forests; data archiving at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

- Study Area and Sampling Design
  - Location: humid tropical forest in CAZ, eastern Madagascar (370,032 ha).
  - Four Zones of Interest (ZOIs): Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4).
  - ZOI selection for BGB direct measurements: Anjahamana (ZOI3) and Andasibe (ZOI2) based on standing biomass density.
  - Target trees: focus on closed-canopy land use; 54 target trees selected across zones, sites, species, and DBH classes (large DBH ≥ 20 cm, medium 10–20 cm, small 5–10 cm) from four dominant species per site/ZOI.
  - Site selection strategy: evaluate AGB by site, identify high/medium/low ranges, and ensure representative DBH class contributions; select at least 3 sites per ZOI for BGB measurements, accounting for access and protected-area restrictions.

- Field Methods for Root Biomass
  - Target tree data collection: record species, DBH, height, and neighboring trees; measure distances to neighbors; compute target-tree influence area for biomass estimation.
  - Two primary BGB measurement methods:
    - Voronoï polygon method
      - Delimit a polygon around the target tree using neighboring trees, with root influence assumed to relate to tree size; sample roots within the polygon across soil horizons (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm) and include CR0 (roots above soil).
      - For each polygon, select one small-tree triangle and two larger-tree triangles to sample ramified roots; extract, wash, and weigh roots (FR, MR, CR) and stump separately; collect lab samples.
      - Record ramification measurements (length, diameters at start/end, mean diameter) and root weights; compute total fresh and dry weights.
    - Pits method (alternative)
      - Three pits (1 m²) around the target tree in an equilateral triangle (centered on the tree, 10 m from each vertex, 120° apart); excavate and sort roots by diameter into FR, MR, CR across three depth horizons; weigh and collect lab samples.
  - Root categorization and sampling depth: fine (FR, <2 mm), medium (MR, 2–10 mm), coarse (CR, ≥10 mm); include CR0 above soil; stump weighed separately.
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) data collection is conducted in parallel on the same target trees.

- Laboratory Works
  - Oven-dry samples at 75°C until constant weight (about 48 hours for FR/MR; longer for CR and stump).
  - Weigh dried samples to obtain dry biomass by category (FR, MR, CR, CR0, stump) per tree and per sampling method.

- Calculation of Root Biomass and AGB
  - Root biomass per tree: sum oven-dry weights across root categories; for Voronoï, use triangle areas to scale within the polygon; for pits, aggregate from sampled pits.
  - Tree-level BGB to stand-level estimates: develop allometry to extrapolate BGB per tree to site/landscape scales.
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB): direct measurements of trunk, leaves, and branches on target trees; AGB per tree calculated using direct weights and complemented by allometric equations (Chave et al., 2014) for site-level upscaling to Mg.ha⁻¹.
  - BGB data structure and modeling aim to refine allometric equations and improve carbon stock estimates for the CAZ ecosystem.

- Data Management and Outputs
  - All datasets generated from field and laboratory work are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
  - Data quality emphasis on careful separation of root categories, soil horizons, and tree-associated measurements; ongoing data processing supports publication-ready allometric models for both root and aboveground biomass.

- Conclusion and Relevance
  - The manual documents a rigorous, field- and lab-based protocol to quantify belowground biomass and carbon stocks, enabling robust allometric modeling for BGB and integration with AGB estimates.
  - Findings support ecosystem service sustainability and REDD+ initiatives in Madagascar’s CAZ, contributing to improved carbon accounting and policy-relevant insights.
