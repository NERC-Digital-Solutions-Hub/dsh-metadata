# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2)

- Purpose and scope
  - Carbon quantification in the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ), eastern Madagascar, focusing on belowground/root biomass (BGB) as a key but under-studied carbon pool among the five IPCC-defined pools.
  - Aims: direct BGB measurements on selected trees, compare BGB quantification methods, calculate tree- and stand-level BGB (kg.tree⁻¹ and Mg.ha⁻¹) to support allometric model development and carbon stock assessments for ecosystem services and REDD+ initiatives.

- Datasets and data types
  - Field data
    - Target trees: species, DBH, height, and site context; neighboring trees and distances; zones of interest (ZOIs2 and 3) used for direct BGB measurements.
    - BGB components: stump, coarse roots (CR, ≥10 mm), medium roots (MR, 2–10 mm), fine roots (FR, <2 mm); soil horizons (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm); CR0 (roots above soil).
    - Ramifications: measurements of root ramification length, diameters (beginning and end), mean diameters, and weights.
    - AGB data: direct measurement of trunk, leaves, and branches for Aboveground Biomass (AGB) components.
  - Laboratory data
    - Oven-dry weights for all root categories and stump; sample preparation and constant-weight verification.
  - Calculated data
    - AGB per tree/stand using CHAVE 2014 allometry; BGB per tree and per site; stand-level biomass per hectare (Mg.ha⁻¹); comparisons between Voronoï and pit methods.
  - Documentation
    - Glossary, abbreviations, units; table of contents; figures and maps; references.

- Data collection and methodological standards
  - Study area and design
    - CAZ humid tropical forest; four ZOIs identified, with two (ZOI2 Andasibe and ZOI3 Anjahamana) selected for BGB direct measurements based on AGB density and site representativeness.
  - Target tree selection and sampling design
    - Focus on closed canopy land use; three DBH classes (large ≥20 cm, medium 10–20 cm, small 5–10 cm); three dominant species per site; 54 target trees selected (2 ZOIs × 3 sites × 3 species × 3 DBH classes).
  - Methods for belowground biomass
    - Voronoï polygon method: delineates root influence around a target tree; roots outside polygon balanced by neighboring trees; soil depths and root categories excavated and weighed; Ramifications measured and sampled.
    - Pits method: three 1 m² pits around the target, centered on the tree, 10 m from center to vertices, to estimate roots; included but noted potential underestimation in humid tropical forests.
  - Data collection details
    - Root excavation, washing, weighing, and lab sampling per category (FR, MR, CR, CR0); root ramification measurements (length, diameters, weights).
    - AGB direct collection: weighing trunk, leaves, and branches for direct measurement.
  - Calculations and scaling
    - Allometric equations (Chave et al. 2014) used to estimate AGB for site-level planning; BGB calculated at tree level from measured/root samples; upscaling to stand-level biomass per hectare.

- Data quality, accuracy, and handling
  - Standardization and protocols
    - Consistent categorization of root types; uniform depths and measurement procedures; use of CHAVE 2014 for AGB estimation.
  - Laboratory procedures
    - Oven-drying at 75°C with repeated weighing until constant weight; typical durations vary by root category.
  - Documentation and provenance
    - Clear attribution of field teams, laboratory leadership, and collaborators; comprehensive glossary and unit definitions to support interoperability.
  - Limitations and considerations
    - BGB direct measurement is time- and cost-intensive; pits method may underestimate BGB in humid tropical contexts; study restricted by access within protected areas.

- Data storage, archiving, and access
  - All datasets generated by the methodology are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) with project-wide data management and long-term preservation.
  - Data intended to support publication of allometric models for root and aboveground biomass, and to inform carbon stock estimates for REDD+ and related ecosystem service assessments.

- Metadata, documentation, and governance
  - Rich metadata accompanying datasets (including units, definitions, and methodological context) via included glossary and abbreviations.
  - Collaborative authorship and field-lab roles documented (assistants, collaborators, field teams, laboratory responsible) to support data stewardship, auditability, and reproducibility.

- Lifecycle and updates
  - Project period: April 2014 – June 2015; update ongoing as of February 2017, reflecting ongoing data processing, model development, and publication readiness.
