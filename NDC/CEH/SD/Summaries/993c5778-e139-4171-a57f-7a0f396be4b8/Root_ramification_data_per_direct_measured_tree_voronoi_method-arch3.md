    - Variable Type: Categorical
    - Unit: L (Large) / M (Medium) / S (Small)
  - Code_target_tree
    - Information: Code assigned to each target tree (linked to site, species, diameter class)
    - Variable Type: Text String
  - Number of ramification
    - Information: Number of ramifications from the north
    - Variable Type: Numeric
  - DiH (Horizontal diameter beginning)
    - Information: Horizontal diameter at the start of each ramification
    - Variable Type: Numeric
    - Unit: Centimeter
  - DiV (Vertical diameter beginning)
    - Information: Vertical diameter at the start of each ramification
    - Variable Type: Numeric
    - Unit: Centimeter
  - DfV (Vertical diameter ending)
    - Information: Vertical diameter at the end of each ramification
    - Variable Type: Numeric
    - Unit: Centimeter
  - DfH (Horizontal diameter ending)
    - Information: Horizontal diameter at the end of each ramification
    - Variable Type: Numeric
    - Unit: Centimeter
  - DfM (Diameter ending mean)
    - Information: DfM = (DfH + DfV) / 2
    - Variable Type: Numeric
    - Unit: Centimeter
  - Total_weight
    - Information: Weight of each ramification
    - Variable Type: Numeric
    - Unit: grams (g)
  - Total_length
    - Information: Length of each ramification
    - Variable Type: Numeric
    - Unit: Centimeter
  - Orientation
    - Information: Indicates direction of each ramification
    - Variable Type: Categorical
    - Unit: N (North), S (South), E (East), W (West); Vor indicates ramification from the Voronoi triangle where roots were excavated; PV indicates taproot; NA = Not available (ramification not visible/blocked)
  
- Data scope and structure
  - Granularity: Record of every ramification for each target tree; includes both orientation categories (Voronoi-based and PV taproot context)
  - Coverage: Root architecture data captured for specified sites within the zone of interest (Andasibe and Anjahamana)

- Usage and governance notes
  - Data provenance is linked to a formal project with a DOI, enabling citation and traceability
  - Public sharing and appropriate acknowledgement are emphasized through project guidelines and institutional affiliations
  - Metadata richness (e.g., ZOI, site, local names) supports verification and potential data integration, though some fields (like NA orientation) indicate instances of incomplete visibility during measurement

- Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Enables assessment of belowground root architecture across target trees, useful for understanding root-system development and environmental interactions
  - Variables provide measurable traits (ramification counts, diameters, lengths, weights) suitable for comparative analyses and policy-relevant monitoring dashboards
  - Clear documentation of measurement context (Voronoi-based versus taproot-oriented) aids interpretation and comparability across studies or monitoring programs
