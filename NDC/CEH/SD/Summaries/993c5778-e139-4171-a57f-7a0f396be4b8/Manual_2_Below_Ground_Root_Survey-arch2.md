# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2) Period April 2014 - June 2015

## Context and Aims
- Part of the p4ges project “Can paying for global ecosystem services reduce poverty?” focusing on carbon quantification in the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ), eastern Madagascar.
- Carbon stock assessment across five IPCC pools; special emphasis on belowground/root biomass (BGB), a significant but under-studied pool.
- Objectives for WP4: conduct direct BGB measurements on selected trees, compare BGB quantification methods, derive tree- and stand-level biomass to develop allometric equations for BGB, and support carbon accounting for REDD+ and ecosystem service payments.
- Approach includes both direct measurement and development of allometric models; data archived for reuse (EIDC).

## Study Area
- Humid tropical forest in CAZ, eastern Madagascar (370,032 ha).
- Four initial zones of interest (ZOIs): Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4).
- ZOI selection based on biophysical criteria (altitude, slope, bioclimate, dry season, soil) and deforestation/access factors.
- For direct BGB measurements, two ZOIs were retained: Anjahamana (ZOI3) and Andasibe (ZOI2).

## Target Trees: Selection Process
- Focus on closed canopy forest within the selected ZOIs.
- Use existing forest inventory data to identify species, DBH classes, and heights; estimate AGB per tree using Chave et al. (2014) allometric equation.
- Sites were classified by AGB density (high/medium/low) to ensure representativeness across DBH classes.
- Selection criteria yielded 54 target trees across 2 ZOIs, 3 sites per ZOI, 3 dominant species per site, and 3 DBH classes per species (large DBH ≥ 20 cm, medium 10–20 cm, small 5–10 cm).

## Root Biomass Methodologies

### Field Methods
- Two main approaches to measure BGB around target trees:
  - Voronoï polygon method
  - Pits method
- Voronoï polygon method
  - Delimits a polygon around the target tree based on neighboring trees to approximate below-ground competition influence.
  - Field steps include selecting target and neighboring trees, recording species, DBH, height, distances, and calculating polygon area from triangle components.
  - For each polygon: collect root samples by depth (top 0–10 cm, subsoil 10–30 cm, deep 30–50 cm) and categorize roots into stump, coarse roots (CR, ≥10 mm), medium roots (MR, 2–10 mm), and fine roots (FR, <2 mm); separate roots from neighboring trees to avoid cross-contamination.
  - Ramification measurements for CRs: length, diameters at ends, and weight to improve biomass estimates.
- Pits method
  - Three 1 m² pits around the target tree (equilateral triangle, 10 m from center to each vertex, 120° angle) to excavate all roots in three depth horizons.
  - Roots sorted into FR, MR, CR, weighed, washed, and sampled for lab analyses.
  - Recognized potential underestimation in humid tropical forests and used as a comparative reference.

### Laboratory Work
- Oven-dry root samples at 75°C until constant weight (typically ~48 hours for FR/MR; longer for CR and stump).
- Dry weights converted to total root biomass per tree; data used to develop allometric relationships for stand-level BGB.

## Aboveground Biomass (AGB) Direct Measurement
- Simultaneous measurements of AGB components (trunk, branches, leaves) on target trees after destructive sampling.
- Fresh weights collected for AGB components; data used in conjunction with BGB to calibrate whole-tree biomass models.

## Calculation and Data Management
- BGB per tree calculated by integrating field-determined dry weights across root categories and sampling areas (Voronoï polygons or pits).
- Voronoï-based biomass calculations incorporate polygon area and root weights; combined with trees’ DBH to refine allometry.
- AGB at tree level estimated with allometric equations; stand-level AGB and BGB derived by upscaling across plots/sites.
- All generated datasets archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) for long-term access and reuse.

## Conclusions and Implications
- Anticipated to yield robust allometric models for root biomass and aboveground biomass in CAZ, contributing to accurate carbon stock accounting.
- Root carbon data particularly valuable given the significant but often neglected BGB share in tropical forests; supports REDD+ monitoring and poverty reduction via ecosystem services.
- Acknowledges methodological considerations: Voronoï method favored for representativeness; pits method used as a comparative check and may underestimate BGB in humid tropical forests.
