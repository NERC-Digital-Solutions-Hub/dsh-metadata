# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Root_carbon_stock_per_direct_measured_tree_pit_method.csv Please also see Manual_2_Belowground_Root_Survey.

## Overview
- Provides root biomass and carbon stock measurements.
- Associated with ESPA Programme and P4GES Project; DOI provided.
- Acknowledgement required for products derived from these data (Laboratoire des Radio Isotopes, Université d'Antananarivo).
- References the Manual_2_Belowground_Root_Survey for methodological context.

## Dataset structure and key variables
- site_ID: P4GES WP4 site code; Information = text string; Unit = none.
- Subplot: subplot where the sample was collected; Type = Categorical; Unit = S1 / S2 / S3 / S4.
- Category_root: category of root (Coarse Root CR or Medium Root MR); Type = Categorical; Unit = CR, MR.
- Biomasse: biomass stock of roots; Type = Numeric; Unit = Milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1).
- Root_C_Stock: carbon stock of roots; Type = Numeric; Unit = Mg.ha-1.

## Metadata and data governance
- Clear field definitions, data types, and units provided to support discoverability and reuse.
- DOI and project affiliations aid provenance and accountability.
- Explicit acknowledgement requirement supports data sharing ethics and attribution.

## Implications for data leaders
- Illustrates the importance of comprehensive header metadata to enable data discovery, integration, and governance across partners.
- Highlights potential unit consistency considerations (Biomasse in mg.ha-1 vs Root_C_Stock in Mg.ha-1) that should be harmonized for cross-dataset analyses.
- Demonstrates linking of field data to supporting manuals and project documentation for reproducibility.

## Recommendations for use and next steps
- Validate unit consistency across related datasets before integration.
- Ensure acknowledgement requirements are incorporated in any derived products.
- Maintain reference to DOI and underlying manuals to preserve provenance.
- Review metadata completeness periodically to support ongoing discoverability and updates.
