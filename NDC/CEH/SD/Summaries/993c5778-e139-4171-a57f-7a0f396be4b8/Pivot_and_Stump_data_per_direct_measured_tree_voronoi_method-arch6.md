# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Pivot_and_Stump_data_per_direct_measured_tree_voronoi_method.csv

- Purpose: Describes the dataset that records measurements on stump, pivot (taproot), and surface roots after tree felling, including how weights were collected and stored for downstream analysis.
- Context and provenance:
  - Related manual: Manual_2_Belowground_Root_Survey (page 9).
  - DOI and program: DOI provided; ESPA programme; Project P4GES.
  - Acknowledgement: Laboratoire des Radio Isotopes, Université d'Antananarivo must be acknowledged for derived products.
- Data content overview:
  - Targeted measurements: fresh and dry weights of pivot (taproot), stump, and coarse roots above soil (CR0); includes both total weights and sample weights.
  - Location and identification fields: Zone of Interest (ZOI) with categorical type, Location (text), Site_Id (site code), Local_name (vernacular tree name), and Code_target_tree (linking site, species, and diameter class).
  - Data categorization and units:
    - ZOI: Information (Zone of Interest), Variable Type (Categorical), Unit (not specified).
    - Location-related fields: Text strings with no unit.
    - Weight fields: Numeric, all weights in grammes (g).
- Key variables described:
  - Weight_Freshtotal_Pivot, Weight_Freshsample_Pivot, Weight_Drysample_Pivot
  - Weight_Freshtotal_Stump, Weight_Freshsample_Stump, Weight_Drysample_Stump
  - Weight_Freshtotal_CR0, Weight_Freshsample_CR0, Weight_Drysample_CR0
  - Location and identification fields: Location, Site_Id, Local_name, Code_target_tree
  - Code_target_tree links to site, species, and diameter class
- Measurements and methods:
  - Pivot (taproot) and stump weights recorded as total fresh weight and separated fresh and dry sample weights.
  - CR0 (coarse roots above soil) weights recorded similarly.
  - Stump and pivot measurements reflect post-helling processing (stump cut, taproot excavated and weighed).
- Data usage considerations for analysts (Data Support perspective):
  - Enables cross-site comparisons of belowground biomass components by root type.
  - Supports creation of dashboards or pivot tables to explore relationships between location, site, species, and root biomass.
  - Requires careful handling of varying data formats and potential patchiness when integrating with other datasets.
  - Properly cite the DOI and acknowledge the contributing laboratory when using derived products.
- Practical notes for end users:
  - Ensure consistent unit interpretation (weights in grams).
  - Use Code_target_tree to join with species and site metadata.
  - Leverage ZOI, Location, Site_Id, and Local_name to contextualize root measurements by sampling point.
