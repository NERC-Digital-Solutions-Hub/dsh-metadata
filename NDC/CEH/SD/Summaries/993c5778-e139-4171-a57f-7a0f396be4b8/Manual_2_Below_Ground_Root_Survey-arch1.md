# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2)

- Period: April 2014 - June 2015; Update: February 2017
- Context:
  - The p4ges project aims to influence payement for global ecosystem services at international scale to alleviate poverty.
  - Focused on carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ), eastern Madagascar, across five IPCC-defined pools; special attention given to belowground biomass (BGB), which can represent up to ~40% of total biomass.
  - This manual (N°2) builds on Manual N°1 to quantify belowground/root biomass (BGB) and to develop allometric relationships for accurate root and carbon estimation.
- Objectives:
  - Directly measure BGB on selected trees to obtain accurate estimates.
  - Compare and evaluate methods for BGB quantification on the same trees/sites/areas.
  - Calculate tree-level BGB (kg tree^-1) to develop allometric equations for stand-level biomass (Mg ha^-1).
  - Emphasize the root/below-ground pool to support carbon stock knowledge and REDD+ initiatives.
- Study area:
  - CAZ humid tropical forest in eastern Madagascar; area ~370,032 ha.
  - Four zones of interest (ZOIs): Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4).
  - ZOIs chosen based on biophysical criteria (altitude, slope, bioclimate, dry season, soils) and deforestation history/access.
  - For direct BGB measurements, two ZOIs were retained: Anjahamana (ZOI3) and Andasibe (ZOI2).
- Target trees selection:
  - Focus on Closed Canopy land use within the selected ZOIs.
  - Use prior forest inventory data to identify dominant species and DBH classes.
  - Tree categories: large (DBH ≥ 20 cm), medium (10 ≤ DBH < 20 cm), small (5 ≤ DBH < 10 cm).
  - Selection criteria included representation across DBH classes and site biomass contributions, along with accessibility and permitting constraints.
  - Total targets: 54 trees selected for direct BGB measurement (2 ZOIs × 3 sites × 3 species × 3 DBH classes per species).
- Field methods for BGB (two approaches):
  - Method of Voronoï polygon:
    - Concept: delineate a polygon around a target tree such that its roots are represented within that space, balancing with neighboring trees.
    - Experimental design: target tree plus up to four neighboring trees; measure DBH and height of all, distances to neighbors, and compute polygon boundaries.
    - Root sampling: for each polygon, excavate around the target within 0–50 cm soil depths (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm) and include CR0 (roots above soil); collect FR, MR, CR roots; separate stump and pivot; measure ramification details (length, diameters) and weigh roots; samples taken for lab analysis.
  - Method of pits:
    - Design: three 1 m^2 pits arranged at the vertices of an equilateral triangle around the target tree, center 10 m from vertices, 120° apart.
    - Purpose: alternative root sampling around target; root sorting into FR, MR, CR; roots washed, weighed, and samples collected for lab work.
    - Note: pit method can underestimate BGB in humid tropical forests; tested as a comparison.
- Laboratory work:
  - Samples dried in an oven at 75°C; continuous weighing until constant weight reached (typically ~48 hours for fine/medium roots; longer for coarse roots and stump).
  - Oven-dried weights used to compute total root biomass per tree and to develop allometric equations.
- Calculation of root biomass and biomass estimation:
  - For Voronoï method: use triangle areas and polygon geometry to estimate sampled area; aggregate to total root biomass per tree.
  - Dry weights are used to scale to stand-level biomass via allometric relationships (to be developed).
- Aboveground biomass (AGB) measurement:
  - AGB components (trunk, leaves, branches) measured directly on targeted trees while they were slaughtered, providing fresh weights for AGB per tree following established methods (e.g., Picard et al. 2012).
  - AGB data collected in parallel with BGB measurements to support comprehensive biomass allometry.
- Data management and outputs:
  - All datasets generated by the methodology are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
  - Objective to publish allometric models for root biomass and aboveground biomass; contribute to carbon stock knowledge and REDD+ initiatives in Madagascar.
- Conclusion and relevance:
  - Direct BGB measurements and allometry will improve understanding of carbon stocks in the CAZ, particularly the often neglected belowground pool.
  - Findings support sustainable ecosystem service management and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) efforts in the eastern Malagasy rainforest.
