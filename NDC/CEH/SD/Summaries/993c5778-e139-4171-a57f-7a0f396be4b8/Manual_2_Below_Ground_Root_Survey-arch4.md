# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2)

- Context and aim
  - p4ges project in Madagascar aims to influence global ecosystem service payments and poverty reduction through carbon assessments.
  - WP4 focuses on carbon quantification in the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ), with special attention to belowground biomass (BGB).
  - Goals include direct BGB measurements, comparing methods, and developing allometric models to estimate BGB and stand-level carbon Stocks; data archived for broader use and REDD+ relevance.

- Study area and sampling design
  - Humid tropical forest in CAZ, eastern Madagascar, covering about 370,032 ha.
  - Four zones of interest (ZOIs): Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana, Didy.
  - Two ZOIs retained for BGB direct measurements based on standing biomass estimates.
  - Target trees selected from four zones with three representative species per site; three DBH classes (large ≥20 cm, medium 10–20 cm, small 5–10 cm).
  - Total of 54 target trees selected for direct BGB measurements (2 ZOIs × 3 sites × 3 species × 3 DBH classes).

- Data collection: aboveground and belowground
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB): direct measurement of trunk, branches, and leaves for target trees.
  - Belowground biomass (BGB): distributed into four categories per tree – stump, coarse roots (CR ≥10 mm), medium roots (MR 2–10 mm), and fine roots (FR <2 mm); additional CR0 (roots above soil) considered.
  - Soil depth sampling: 0–10 cm (topsoil), 10–30 cm (subsoil), 30–50 cm (deep soil).
  - Root data collection methods:
    - Voronoi polygon method to assign root biomass to target trees; includes field delimitation, root excavation by soil horizons, and separation from neighboring trees.
    - Pit method as a comparative approach (three 1 m² pits around the target tree; found potentially underestimates BGB in humid tropics).
  - Ramifications and root measurements:
    - For CR ramification: length, diameters at start/end, and mean ending diameter; samples weighed and analyzed.
  - Laboratory processing: oven-drying at 75°C until constant weight; typical 48 hours for FR/MR, longer for CR and stump; dry weights used for biomass calculations.

- Data processing and models
  - AGB estimation at tree level using Chave et al. (2014) allometric equation (based on wood density, DBH, height) for site-level upscaling to Mg ha⁻¹.
  - BGB at tree level derived from oven-dry weights; summed across components and rooted within the respective measurement method (Voronoi or pits) to build allometric relationships for stand-level BGB.
  - Data integration to develop allometric models for root biomass and validate AGB measurements; results intended to support carbon stock estimates for CAZ and REDD+ initiatives.

- Data access, standards, and governance
  - All datasets generated (root biomass, AGB, site and tree measurements, laboratory results) archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
  - Documentation includes glossary and units (e.g., AGB in Mg ha⁻¹, root biomass in kg tree⁻¹; various DBH and height measurements).
  - The manual provides methodological detail to ensure replicability and future data discovery/usage.

- Outcomes and relevance
  - Production of direct BGB measurements for humid tropical forests in Madagascar, contributing to robust carbon stock estimates.
  - Development of allometric models for root and aboveground biomass to improve carbon accounting at stand and landscape scales.
  - Enhanced understanding of belowground carbon pools, improving ecosystem service valuation and REDD+ program sustainability in the region.
