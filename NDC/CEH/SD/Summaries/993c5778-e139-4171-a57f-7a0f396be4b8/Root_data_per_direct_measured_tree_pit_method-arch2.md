# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for: Root_data_per_direct_measured_tree_pit_method.csv

## Purpose and scope
- Describes the data header for a dataset that records information on target trees and their locations.
- Represents data collected via a direct-measured tree pit method, focusing on root and related environmental measurements.
- Aims to support standardized, transparent monitoring of environmental conditions and root-related biomass variables.

## Geographic and site metadata
- Zone of Interest (ZOI): Categorical zones such as Andasibe and Anjahamana.
- Location: Name of the sampling point location.
- Site_Id: Code identifying the site where the target tree was collected.
- Local_name: Vernacular/local name of the tree species inventoried.
- Code_target_tree: Code linking site, species name, and diameter class for each target tree.
- Diameter_class: Tree diameter category (Large - L: >20 cm; Medium - M: 10–20 cm; Small - S: <10 cm).
- Code_Pit: Pit identifier within the sampling location (P1, P2, P3).

## Sample design and targets
- Target tree information: Records pertain to individual target trees and their locations within the Zone of Interest.
- Pit-based sampling: Data include measurements taken from designated pits associated with each target tree.

## Data quality, provenance and standards
- Data are documented with comprehensive header information to enable verification, QA, and transformation.
- Data are expected to be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed from established sources.
- Outputs can be presented in standard formats (e.g., tables, maps, charts) and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Usage notes and integration
- The dataset is designed to be compatible with other environmental datasets, supporting data linkage via ZOI, location, site, and pit codes.
- Highlights the importance of enabling access to underlying data used to produce final outputs, aligning with the architype’s emphasis on data reuse and portal access.

## Reference and contact points
- DOI and project/program references provided for traceability.
- Acknowledgement requirement indicates custodianship and data provenance practices.
