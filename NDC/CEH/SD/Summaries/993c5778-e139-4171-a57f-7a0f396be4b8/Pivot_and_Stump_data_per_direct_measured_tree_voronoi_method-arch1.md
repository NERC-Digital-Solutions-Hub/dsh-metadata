# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Pivot_and_Stump_data_per_direct_measured_tree_voronoi_method.csv

## Purpose and scope
- This dataset records information on the stump, pivot (taproot), and surface roots of felled trees.
- After felling, the stump is cut and the taproot excavated and weighed.

## Data structure and key variables
- Zone of Interest (ZOI): Categorical variable indicating sampling area; examples include ZOI2: Andasibe and ZOI3: Anjahamana.
- Location: Name of the sampling point location (text).
- Site_Id: Code assigned to the site where the tree was collected (text).
- Local_name: Vernacular/local name of the target tree (text).
- Code_target_tree: Code for each target tree, linking to species name and diameter class (text).

## Measurements and units
- Weight_Freshtotal_Pivot: Fresh total weight of the pivot (grammes, numeric).
- Weight_Freshsample_Pivot: Pivot sample fresh weight (grams, numeric).
- Weight_Drysample_Pivot: Pivot sample dry weight (grams, numeric).
- Weight_Freshtotal_Stump: Fresh total weight of the stump (grams, numeric).
- Weight_Freshsample_Stump: Stump sample fresh weight (grams, numeric).
- Weight_Drysample_Stump: Stump sample dry weight (grams, numeric).
- Weight_Freshtotal_CR0: Fresh total weight of the coarse roots found above soil (CR0) (grams, numeric).
- Weight_Freshsample_CR0: CR0 sample fresh weight (grams, numeric).
- Weight_Drysample_CR0: CR0 sample dry weight (grams, numeric).

## Notes on data usage
- Code_target_tree associates each target tree with species name and diameter class.
- The dataset is linked to the ESPA Programme (P4GES) and carries a DOI; acknowledgments are required for products derived from these data.
