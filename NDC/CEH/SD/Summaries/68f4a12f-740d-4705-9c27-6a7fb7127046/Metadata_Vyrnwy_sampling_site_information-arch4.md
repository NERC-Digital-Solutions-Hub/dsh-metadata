# PRIMARY Dyfnant Forest draining in to Llyn Vyrnwy

## Overview
- A multi-feature data record for the Dyfnant Forest catchment draining into Llyn Vyrnwy, focused on hydrochemistry within plantation spruce forest soils (brown earth soils) and associated rainfall, streams, and boreholes.
- Data types include rainfall measurements, two ephemeral/stream datasets, and two boreholes, all tied to the Vyrnwy region in mid Wales.
- Temporal span for the recorded data ranges from 5-Dec-1994 to 16-Feb-2001; the primary reference documenting the hydrochemistry study was published in 2004.

## Temporal and Spatial Coverage
- Timeframe: 1994-12-05 to 2001-02-16 (for rainfall, streams, boreholes)
- Geography: Dyfnant Forest area, feeding into Llyn Vyrnwy and Afon Hirnant, mid-Wales; coordinates span Eastings ~298k–303k and latitudes ~52.7796–52.7860, longitudes ~-3.4309 to -3.5107.

## Data Source, Metadata, and Reference
- Primary reference: “Vyrnwy: streams, groundwater and rainfall” (Neal C., Reynolds B., Neal M., Williams B., 2004). Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 8, 460-484.
- Site-level metadata includes multiple geospatial identifiers (location codes, easting/northing, lat/long, altitude), land management notes, soil/vegetation types, and start/end dates.
- Reference number across records: 10.

## Data Quality, Discoverability, and Metadata Considerations
- Metadata is rich in geospatial and environmental attributes but shows some truncated or ambiguous text inPlaces (e.g., Vyrnwy2 Borehole description). Inconsistent or partial text indicates potential metadata quality issues that may require clarification for reuse.
- Data are linked to a single primary publication; explicit access details are not provided in this document, suggesting follow-up to the 2004 Hydrology and Earth System Sciences paper may be needed for data retrieval and methods.
- Clear documentation of measurement methods, intervals, and calibration would enhance interoperability for wider data integration.

## Potential Uses for Data Leaders
- Support hydrochemical and hydrological modelling of plantation forest catchments, particularly with brown earth soils.
- Assess impacts of forestry practices (e.g., clearfelling in 1997) on stream/groundwater systems and rainfall-runoff relationships.
- Inform data strategy around asset discoverability, metadata standards, and cross-site data integration within forested catchment networks.
- Enable cross-partner or cross-network collaboration by aligning datasets with similar hydrochemistry studies.

## Alignment with Data Leadership Aims and Challenges
- Data assets: well-structured geospatially-tagged data across rainfall, streams, and boreholes with consistent reference numbering, suitable for building an integrated data product.
- User needs and co-ownership: data likely serve researchers and policy colleagues studying forest catchments and water quality; potential for co-ownership through linked datasets and publications.
- Data availability and gaps: datasets appear localized and time-bounded; broader data discovery would benefit from standardized metadata and expanded data sharing across similar catchments.
- Data standards, quality, and metadata: partial textual metadata highlights the need for clearer, standardized documentation to reduce ambiguity and improve discoverability.
- Collaboration: ties to a published hydrochemical study suggest opportunities for wider community engagement and replication across similar forested systems.
