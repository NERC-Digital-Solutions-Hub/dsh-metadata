# SAMPLING

- Overview
  - The document documents sampling protocols for multiple environmental media (rainfall, cloud, stream water, groundwater, throughfall, stemflow) including collection methods, devices, flow/volume measurement, field measurements, sampling intervals, and temporal coverage (start/finish dates).

- Rainfall
  - Collection: Bulk sample
  - Collection devices: Continuously open 15 cm diameter PVC collector with anti-bird protection & coarse filter; Warren Spring pattern collector
  - Flow/volume: Tanllwyth met site ground level raingauge
  - Field measurements: Air temperature (glass thermometer and thermistor probe)
  - Sampling interval: Weekly/daily
  - Timeframe: 10 May 1983 – 18 May 1999; 25 May 1999 – continuous
  - Filtration: Lab

- Cloud
  - Collection: Bulk sample
  - Collection device: CEH (Edinburgh) pattern lidded harp-type passive collector
  - Flow/volume: Weight of sample
  - Field measurements: None
  - Sampling interval: Weekly
  - Timeframe: 25 Sep 1990 – continuous
  - Filtration: Lab

- Stream water
  - Collection: Grab samples
  - Collection device: Plastic bucket attached to plastic cord; sample taken near middle of stream
  - Flow/volume: CEH stream (flume) gauges; for streams not sampled by flumes, flow record to nearest flume
  - Field measurements: Stream temperature (glass thermometer/thermistor probe); electrical conductivity (field meters corrected to 25°C)
  - Sampling interval: Weekly/Daily
  - Timeframe: 10 May 1983 – continuous
  - Filtration: Field

- Groundwater
  - Collection: Grab samples after flushing of boreholes
  - Collection device: BGS borehole sampler
  - Flow/volume: Dip level recorder; depth relative to top of borehole cover
  - Field measurements: Groundwater temperature; electrical conductivity (field meters corrected to 25°C)
  - Sampling interval: Monthly/fortnightly/weekly
  - Timeframe: 24 Apr 1994 – 14 Feb 2001
  - Filtration: Field

- Throughfall
  - Collection: Bulk sample
  - Collection device: Trough collector
  - Flow/volume: Volume of sample
  - Field measurements: None
  - Sampling interval: Fortnightly
  - Timeframe: 6 Feb 1984 – 2 Sep 1991
  - Filtration: Lab

- Stemflow
  - Collection: Bulk sample
  - Collection device: Plastic tubing wrapped around trees and carboy collector
  - Flow/volume: Volume of sample
  - Field measurements: None
  - Sampling interval: Fortnightly
  - Timeframe: 6 Feb 1984 – 2 Sep 1991
  - Filtration: Lab

- Data governance and data quality notes
  - The records emphasize standardized metadata for each medium (method, device, measurements, intervals, and timeframes) to support data usability and traceability, with explicit start/finish dates and contiguity indicators (e.g., continuous).
