## Metadata and Variables
- Consistent metadata across datasets: location codes, coordinates (E/N and lat/long in WGS84), altitude, descriptive text, soil types, vegetation, and land management.
- Each item references the same primary dataset reference number (10).

## Temporal and Spatial Coverage
- Temporal:
  - Rainfall: 5-Dec-1994 to 16-Feb-2001
  - Streams and Boreholes: 7-Oct-1994 to 16-Feb-2001
- Spatial:
  - Dyfnant Forest area in mid Wales linking streams, groundwater, and rainfall measurements.
  - Coordinates cluster around lat ~52.78–52.79 N, lon ~ -3.43 to -3.51 W; elevations 258–350 m.
  - Features include open moorland rainfall site and forested/partly deforested stream/borehole locations.

## Primary Reference
- Vyrnwy: streams, groundwater and rainfall, Neal C., Reynolds B., Neal M., and Williams B. 2004. The hydrochemistry of plantation spruce forest catchments with brown earth soils, Vyrnwy in mid Wales. Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 8, 460-484.

## Data Use and Context
- Supports analysis of hydrochemistry in plantation spruce forest catchments with brown earth soils.
- Serves as a comprehensive, location-specific data bundle (rainfall, surface water, and borehole observations) for modeling hydrology and soil-vegetation interactions.
- Aligned with a published study (Neal et al. 2004) and suitable for building data products (dashboards, self-serve analyses) that integrate rainfall, stream, and groundwater data.
