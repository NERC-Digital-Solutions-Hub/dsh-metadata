- Data provenance and references
  - Primary reference: Vyrnwy: streams, groundwater and rainfall (reference 10)
  - Full citation: Neal C., Reynolds B., Neal M., and Williams B. 2004. The hydrochemistry of plantation spruce forest catchments with brown earth soils, Vyrnwy in mid Wales. Hydrology and Earth System Science, 8, 460-484.
  - SITES mapping: 1 = Reference number for the Vyrnwy dataset (ref. 10) linked to the publication

- Relevance for monitoring framework authors
  - Demonstrates integration of multiple environmental media (rainfall, surface water, groundwater) within a single forested catchment study
  - Uses standardized metadata fields (location codes, coordinates, altitude, soils, vegetation, land management, start/end dates) to support traceability and reproducibility
  - Provides a concrete example for designing monitoring programs that connect hydrology, soil type, vegetation, and management practices
  - Highlights the importance of linking field data to a primary scientific report for evaluation and policy-informed decision-making

- Practical implications for policy and data governance
  - Illustrates the value of linking monitoring datasets to a peer-reviewed publication to support transparency and accountability
  - Underlines the need for precise metadata to overcome potential barriers in data sharing and data quality assessment
  - Serves as a model for documenting start/end dates and land-management changes (e.g., clearfelling) that affect hydrochemistry and environmental health metrics
