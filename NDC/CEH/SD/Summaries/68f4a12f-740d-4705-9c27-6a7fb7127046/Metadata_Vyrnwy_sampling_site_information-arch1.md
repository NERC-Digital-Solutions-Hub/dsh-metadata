# PRIMARY Dyfnant Forest draining in to Llyn Vyrnwy

## Overview
- A hydrochemical study of a plantation spruce forest catchment in mid Wales (Vyrnwy area), focusing on rainfall, streams, and boreholes to understand the interaction between rainfall, groundwater, and surface water.

## Spatial and temporal scope
- Datasets cover multiple interconnected components (rainfall, streams, boreholes) within the Dyfnant Forest area feeding into Llyn Vyrnwy.
- Observation period spans 1994–2001, enabling assessment of forest management changes (e.g., clearfelling in 1997) on hydrochemistry.

## Data connections and context
- Location data include precise eastings/northings and latitude/longitude (WGS84) and altitude for each site.
- Sites are tied to plantation spruce forestry with brown earth soils, enabling investigation of how land management and soil type influence hydrochemistry.

## Relevance for analysis
- Enables analysis of hydrochemical relationships among rainfall inputs, ephemeral streams, and groundwater in a plantation-dominated catchment.
- Supports comparative analysis between disturbed (clearfelled) and control sites to assess impact of forestry practices on hydrology and chemistry.
