# SAMPLING

-Overview
  - Documents standardized sampling protocols for multiple environmental media, detailing collection methods, devices, flow/volume, field measurements, sampling intervals, start/finish dates, and filtration steps to support consistent environmental monitoring and data integration over time.

-Rainfall
  - Collection method: Bulk sample
  - Collection devices: Continuously open, 15 cm diameter PVC collector with anti-bird protection and coarse filter in funnel neck; and a Warren Spring pattern collector (alternative setup)
  - Flow/volume: Tanllwyth met site ground level raingauge
  - Field measurements: Air temperature (glass thermometer and thermistor probe)
  - Sampling interval: Weekly/daily
  - Start/Finish: 10 May 1983 – 18 May 1999; 25 May 1999 – Cont.
  - Filtration: Lab

-Cloud
  - Collection method: Bulk sample
  - Collection device: CEH (Edinburgh) pattern lidded harp-type passive collector
  - Flow/volume: Weight of sample
  - Field measurements: None
  - Sampling interval: Weekly
  - Start/Finish: 25 Sep 1990 – Cont.
  - Filtration: Lab

-Stream water
  - Collection method: Grab samples
  - Collection device: Plastic bucket attached to plastic cord; sample taken near the middle of the stream
  - Flow/volume: CEH stream (flume) gauges; for streams not sampled by flumes, flow record to nearest flume
  - Field measurements: Stream temperature (glass thermometer/thermistor) and electrical conductivity (field meters corrected to 25°C)
  - Sampling interval: Weekly/Daily
  - Start/Finish: 10 May 1983 – Cont.
  - Filtration: Field

-Groundwater
  - Collection method: Grab samples after flushing boreholes
  - Collection device: BGS borehole sampler
  - Flow/volume: Dip level recorder (depth relative to top of borehole datum)
  - Field measurements: Groundwater temperature and electrical conductivity (field meters corrected to 25°C)
  - Sampling interval: Monthly/fortnightly/weekly
  - Start/Finish: 24 Apr 1994 – 14 Feb 2001
  - Filtration: Field

-Throughfall

  - Start/Finish: 6 Feb 1984 – 2 Sep 1991
  - Filtration: Lab

-Stemflow
  - Collection method: Bulk sample
  - Collection device: Plastic tubing wrapped around trees and carboy collector
  - Flow/volume: Volume of sample

-Notes on data quality and accessibility (implied by the structure)
  - Data are captured with standardised metadata across media to enable cross-media analysis and trend assessment.
  - Filtration and processing locations (Lab vs Field) indicate provenance and quality control considerations.
  - Temporal coverage varies by media, with several series continuing beyond stated end dates, supporting long-term environmental health evaluation and policy performance monitoring.
