# LOCATION OF ANALYTICAL DATA PRE-CONCENTRATION PRIOR TO ANALYSIS TO IMPROVE

- Scope and purpose
  - Comprehensive environmental monitoring dataset intended to demonstrate environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Data originate from a network with established monitoring responsibilities, featuring standardized approaches and topic-specific expertise.

- Geographic and program context
  - Monitoring at the Plynlimon catchment area (sites such as Tanllwyth, Carreg Wen, Staylittle, Wallingford analyses, Lancaster analyses, etc.), with data linked to multiple upstream catchments and flow structures.
  - Includes riverine, rainfall, throughfall, cloud, and input ( rainfall-derived ) samples, as well as streamflow and area-weighted runoff calculations.

- Analyte coverage and data structure
  - Large, multi-element chemistries including metals and metalloids (e.g., aluminium, iron, manganese, lead, zinc, cadmium, arsenic, chromium, nickel, uranium, etc.), major ions (chloride, nitrate, sulfate, fluoride, silicate, phosphate), nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, total dissolved nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved sulfur, iodide, conductivity, pH, and other related parameters.
  - Many analytes represented with detailed metadata: determinations (DETERMINAND), units, detection limits, quality control qualifiers, pretreatment/pre-concentration steps, filtration, preservation, and analytical method.

- Analytical methods and pre-concentration
  - Predominant techniques include inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), ion chromatography (IC), automated colorimetry, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis, and various spectroscopic/colorimetric approaches.
  - Pre-concentration prior to analysis applied for several elements (e.g., evaporation of 400 mL to concentrate ~20-fold) to improve detection limits; evaporation performed in teflon vessels with infrared assistance where noted.
  - In-field filtration (0.45 μm membranes) commonly used; samples often preserved by acidification to 1% nitric acid or stored cold (typically 4°C) in dark conditions.
  - Post-collection sample handling SOPs referenced (e.g., SOP 3115b, SOP 3504) with laboratories including Wallingford, Lancaster, Staylittle, Bangor, and others.

- Data quality, QC and accreditation
  - Analytical method QC codes and data qualifier codes defined; codes indicate data quality status, method changes, interlaboratory comparability, and data handling notes.
  - Some methods accredited to ISO 17025; interlaboratory proficiency materials referenced (Aquacheck LGC, NBS SRM 1643b) to validate accuracy.
  - QC qualifiers accompany many records, including notes on instrument performance, method changes, and data suitability for use.

- Sampling design, times and data timestamps
  - Samples include grab samples (stream and borehole) and time-integrated input samples (rainfall, throughfall, stemflow, cloud water); time stamps indicate actual collection times.
  - Volume-weighted sampling times are computed for rainfall-related inputs using hourly rainfall data from Carreg Wen AWS and Tanllwyth AWS, with gaps handled via alternative sites or interval-based assumptions.
  - Year mean sampling is derived from volume-weighted sampling times to enable representative annual comparisons.
  - The dataset uses a structured approach to sampling time bases to improve temporal interpretation of precipitation, runoff and chemical concentrations.

- Flow and runoff conversions
  - Conversion between streamflow (cumecs) and area-weighted runoff (mm/15 min) is provided for specific catchments.
  - Formulas: mm/15min = cumecs × 0.9 / catchment area (km^2); cumecs = mm/15min × catchment area / 0.9.
  - Catchment areas defined for several sites, enabling area-weighted hydrochemistry analyses.

- Temporal coverage and ongoing data
  - Data spans from early 1980s through mid-2000s for numerous analytes, with many records continuing beyond 2007 (indicated as cont.). The document lists start and end dates for individual analyte records, reflecting long-term environmental monitoring.

- Practical use for analysts
  - Provides a robust, standardized metadata framework enabling time-series comparisons, regional trend analysis, and policy performance assessment.
  - Data interpretation relies on explicit handling of sampling type, pre-concentration steps, preservation, filtration, units, QC flags, and cross-lacustrine/interlaboratory calibration notes.
  - Facilitates transparency in data quality, method changes, and data processing (e.g., volume-weighted sampling, flow-to-runoff conversions) necessary for integrated environmental health assessments.
