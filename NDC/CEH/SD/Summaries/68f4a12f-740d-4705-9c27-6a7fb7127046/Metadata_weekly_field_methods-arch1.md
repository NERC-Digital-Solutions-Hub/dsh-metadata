# SAMPLING

- This document documents long-term environmental sampling across multiple media (rainfall, cloud, stream water, groundwater, throughfall, and stemflow), detailing collection methods, devices, measurements, sampling frequency, and timeframes to support data-driven analysis and modelling.

## Rainfall
- First dataset (Rainfall 1):
  - Collection method: Bulk sample
  - Collection device: Continuously open, 15 cm diameter PVC collector with anti-bird protection and coarse neck filter
  - Flow/volume reference: Tanllwyth met site ground level raingauge
  - Field measurements: Air temperature (glass thermometer and thermistor probe)
  - Sampling interval: Weekly/daily
  - Start/Finish: 10 May 1983 – 18 May 1999
  - Filtration: Lab
- Second dataset (Rainfall 2):
  - Collection method: Bulk sample
  - Collection device: Continuously open, Warren Spring pattern collector with anti-bird protection and coarse neck filter
  - Flow/volume: As above (ground level raingauge)
  - Field measurements: Air temperature
  - Sampling interval: Weekly/daily
  - Start/Finish: 25 May 1999 – ongoing
  - Filtration: Lab

## Cloud
- Collection method: Bulk sample
- Collection device: CEH (Edinburgh) pattern lidded harp-type passive collector
- Flow/volume: Weight of sample
- Field measurements: None
- Sampling interval: Weekly
- Start/Finish: 25 Sep 1990 – ongoing
- Filtration: Lab

## Stream water
- Collection method: Grab samples
- Collection device: Plastic bucket attached to plastic cord; sample taken near middle of stream
- Flow/volume: CEH stream (flume) gauges; for streams not sampled by flumes, flow record from nearest flume
- Field measurements: Stream temperature (glass thermometer/thermistor probe), electrical conductivity (field meters corrected to 25°C)
- Sampling interval: Weekly/daily
- Start/Finish: 10 May 1983 – ongoing
- Filtration: Field

## Groundwater
- Collection method: Grab samples after flushing boreholes
- Collection device: BGS borehole sampler
- Flow/volume: Dip level recorder; depth relative to top of borehole cover
- Field measurements: Groundwater temperature, electrical conductivity (field meters corrected to 25°C)
- Sampling interval: Monthly/fortnightly/weekly
- Start/Finish: 24 Apr 1994 – 14 Feb 2001
- Filtration: Field

## Throughfall
- Collection method: Bulk sample
- Collection device: Trough collector
- Flow/volume: Volume of sample
- Field measurements: None
- Sampling interval: Fortnightly
- Start/Finish: 6 Feb 1984 – 2 Sep 1991
- Filtration: Lab

## Stemflow
- Collection method: Bulk sample
- Collection device: Plastic tubing wrapped around trees and carboy collector
- Flow/volume: Volume of sample
- Field measurements: None
- Sampling interval: Fortnightly
- Start/Finish: 6 Feb 1984 – 2 Sep 1991
- Filtration: Lab

## Data scope and potential use
- Covers multiple hydrological pathways with long temporal spans, enabling cross-media comparisons and modelling of rainfall–runoff and related processes.
- Data include both field and lab processing steps, with varying sampling frequencies and clear start/finish windows, supporting trend analysis and correlations across media and time.

## Considerations for analysts
- Harmonize units and time periods when integrating media (e.g., rainfall flux vs. sample weight).
- Align data across datasets with differing start/finish dates and sampling intervals.
- Account for differences in measurement methods (field vs. lab) and collection devices when modelling.
- Note the long-running cloud and rainfall datasets offer extended temporal coverage, while some datasets (e.g., throughfall and stemflow) have shorter historical windows.
