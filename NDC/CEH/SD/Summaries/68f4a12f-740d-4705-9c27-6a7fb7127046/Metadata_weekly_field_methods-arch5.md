# SAMPLING

## Overview
- The document describes multiple environmental sampling datasets collected over several decades, covering rainfall, cloud, stream water, groundwater, throughfall, and stemflow.
- For each sample type, it lists how samples were collected, the devices used, how flow/volume was measured, any field measurements, sampling frequency, time span, filtration method, and start/finish dates.

## Data Elements by Sample Type

- Rainfall
  - COLLECTION METHOD: Bulk sample
  - COLLECTION DEVICE: Continuously open, 15 cm diameter PVC collector with anti-bird protection and coarse filter; and a Warren Spring pattern collector with anti-bird protection and coarse filter
  - FLOW/VOLUME: Tanllwyth met site ground-level raingauge
  - FIELD MEASUREMENTS: Air temperature (glass thermometer and thermistor probe)
  - SAMPLING INTERVAL: Weekly/daily
  - START/FINISH: 10 May 1983 – 18 May 1999; 25 May 1999 – Cont.

  - FIELD MEASUREMENTS: Groundwater temperature (glass thermometer/thermistor probe), electrical conductivity (field meters corrected to 25°C)
  - SAMPLING INTERVAL: Monthly/fortnightly/weekly
  - START/FINISH: 24 Apr 1994 – 14 Feb 2001
  - FILTRATION: Field

- Throughfall

  - FLOW/VOLUME: Volume of sample
  - FIELD MEASUREMENTS: None
  - SAMPLING INTERVAL: Fortnightly
  - START/FINISH: 6 Feb 1984 – 2 Sep 1991
  - FILTRATION: Lab

- Stemflow
  - COLLECTION METHOD: Bulk sample
  - COLLECTION DEVICE: Plastic tubing wrapped around trees and carboy collector
  - FLOW/VOLUME: Volume of sample
  - FIELD MEASUREMENTS: None
  - SAMPLING INTERVAL: Fortnightly
  - START/FINISH: 6 Feb 1984 – 2 Sep 1991
  - FILTRATION: Lab

## Data Quality and Metadata Considerations
- The dataset comprises diverse sample types with different collection devices and measurement approaches, requiring careful harmonization for cross-dataset analysis.
- Metadata coverage includes collection method, device details, how flow/volume is obtained, related field measurements, sampling frequency, and time range, enabling traceability.
- Filtration methods (lab vs field) indicate differing sample processing stages that should be captured in data governance and documentation.

## Data Access and Sharing
- The data are intended to be uploaded to relevant portals with cataloging of data holdings.
- Documentation should note sharing limitations, embargo risks, or proprietary constraints where applicable.

## Challenges for Data Stewards
- Managing an incomplete or evolving picture of user needs and priorities across multiple environmental datasets.
- Ensuring timely and consistent data delivery from multiple data creators.
- Aligning metadata and standards across various collection methods, devices, and formats.
- Handling large, potentially non-interoperable datasets and legacy/databases that may require bespoke solutions.

## Recommendations for Data Stewardship
- Apply standardized metadata schemas to capture all core elements consistently across sample types (collection method, device, measurement, interval, temporal span, processing steps, and filtration).
- Implement data validation and quality checks to ensure consistency in units, dates, and instrument calibration details.
- Maintain clear documentation on data provenance, processing workflows, and any updates or corrections to the datasets.
- Facilitate interoperability by aligning terminologies and formats with common data portals and repositories, and prepare versioned data releases.
- Establish update and governance workflows to manage ongoing data availability, including any embargoes or access restrictions.
