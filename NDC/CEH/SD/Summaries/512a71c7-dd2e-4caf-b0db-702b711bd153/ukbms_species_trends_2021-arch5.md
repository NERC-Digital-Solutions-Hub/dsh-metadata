# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview and governance
  - A collaborative program funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteer contributions; supports ongoing monitoring of butterfly populations across the UK since 1976.
  - Aims to provide data for understanding biodiversity trends and informing policy questions; currently monitors over 2,500 actively recorded sites annually.

- Data collection and structure
  - Three sampling frameworks:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 26 counts/year, 5 m width, weekly from April to September.
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified 1 km squares, 2–3 visits/year.
    - Targeted surveys; single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
  - All data grouped into abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Indices combined using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with site- and year-weighting to reflect sampling effort and flight period coverage.
  - Data management from field forms to online entry (UKBMS site or Transect Walker), then to a central database with regional coordinators overseeing quality.

- Quality control and governance of data
  - Multi-layer validation: automated checks at entry, regional coordinator reviews, and ongoing validation throughout the season.
  - Additional queries target:
    - Records outside known species distributions
    - Observations outside typical flight periods
    - First-time records at a site
    - Extreme or unusual abundances
  - Corrections/edits performed through queries and coordination with recorders to preserve dataset integrity.

- Data download contents and structure
  - Provides long-term and short-term trends for species with sufficient data, in a CSV format.
  - Key columns include:
    - COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME
    - NYEARS (years of series)
    - F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDETAIL (overall trend metrics and interpretation)
    - F_FULL_R (percent change over the series)
    - T20_LIN_B/SE/P, T20_TRENDDETAIL, T20_20_R (20-year metrics)
    - T10_LIN_B/SE/P, T10_TRENDDETAIL, T10_10_R (10-year metrics)
  - Trends cover from 1976 to the year indicated in the download name for each species; start years may vary due to data availability.
  - Data are delivered under an Open Government Licence (OGL) with required citation and attribution.

- Licensing, attribution, and usage guidance
  - Open Government Licence (OGL) permits free use with few conditions.
  - Requires citation of dataset and DOIs as specified in metadata; attribution must include the UKBMS contributors.
  - Instructions provided for including the attribution statement with derived information or images.

- Collaboration, support, and contact information
  - UKBMS partners offer advisory support and interpretation assistance.
  - Potential for co-authorship and intellectual input in publications resulting from UKBMS data.
