# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with volunteers contributing data.
  - Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status from a wide-scale, site-based monitoring program to understand population changes and inform biodiversity policy.
  - Scale: since 1976, monitoring across the United Kingdom with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year; data from all sampling methods are analyzed together.

- Nature of data collected and trend analysis
  - Data are used to create abundance indices (relative, not absolute) for butterfly species.
  - Indices are combined into species-level collated indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method, with a weighting adjustment that accounts for the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year.
  - The method uses counts from all methods (Pollard walks, reduced survey methods, WCBS) to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate missing data, giving more weight to observed data.

- Data collection methods (sampling framework)
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 per year), ~5 m wide, typically 45 minutes to 2 hours, targeting April–September; ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August); ~800 squares per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species.

- Quality control
  - Field recording on standard forms, online entry via UKBMS system or Transect Walker, with automated checks for data entry errors.
  - Regional transect coordinators review data for questionable records and ensure regional validity.
  - Additional automated/manual validation checks for out-of-range distributions, unusual flight periods, first-time site records, and unusual abundances; corrections made through queries and coordination with recorders.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides long- and short-term trends in collated indices for species with sufficient data; delivered as a CSV (.csv) file.
  - Trend columns include:
    - COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS (years in series)
    - F_LIN_B (annual change), F_LIN_SE (SE), F_LIN_P (P-value), F_TRENDETAIL (trend description), F_FULL_R (percent change over the series)
    - T20_LIN_B/SE/P, T20_TRENDDETAIL, T20_20_R (20-year trends and change)
    - T10_LIN_B/SE/P, T10_TRENDDETAIL, T10_10_R (10-year trends and change)
  - Start years vary by species depending on data availability; data cover from 1976 onward where possible.
