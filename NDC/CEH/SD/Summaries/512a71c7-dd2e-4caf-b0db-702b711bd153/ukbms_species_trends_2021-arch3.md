# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - A collaboration of Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Provides annual data on butterfly population status from a wide-scale, site-based monitoring program.
  - Involves volunteer contributions and has operated since 1976, with over 2500 actively recorded sites per year.
  - Data are used to understand insect population changes and answer policy questions related to biodiversity status and trends.
  - Sampling framework includes standard transects (Pollard walks), wider countryside transects (WCBS), and targeted surveys.

- Nature of data collected and trend analysis
  - Data are converted into abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Indices reflect consistent proportions of butterflies present at sites; detectability varies by species.
  - Trends are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weighting to reflect flight period coverage per site/year.
  - All counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS are used to model seasonal patterns and fill gaps, prioritizing observed data.
  - The dataset provides long-term trends and recent trends (last 20 and last 10 years) for all species with sufficient data, including slope, standard error, p-value, and descriptive trend notes.

- Quality control
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online or via bespoke software (Transect Walker).
  - Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusual counts, out-of-season records).
  - Regional transect coordinators review data; additional automated and manual validation ensures records fit known distributions and flight periods.
  - Edits and queries are resolved with coordinators or recorders to maintain dataset integrity.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides long- and short-term trend data for species with adequate data, in CSV format.
  - Columns include common and scientific names, years of series, and multiple trend metrics (linear slopes, standard errors, p-values, and trend descriptions) for both overall and recent (10/20-year) windows.
  - Trend descriptors categorize changes as rapid decline, rapid increase, or stable based on slope direction and significance.
  - Includes percentage change metrics over the full series, last 10 years, and last 20 years.

- Licence and attribution statement
  - Data are provided under an Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use with few conditions.
  - Must include the citation (with DOI) in any publications using the data.
