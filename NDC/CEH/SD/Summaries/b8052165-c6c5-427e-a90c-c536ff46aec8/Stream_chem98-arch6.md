- Notes for data users
  - Data provide a 1998 snapshot of headwater stream chemistry with spatial (1 km square) and site-level identifiers.
  - Useful for cross-dataset analyses (e.g., combining with land classification, environmental zones, or geographic metadata) and for trend or spatial pattern investigations across headwater streams.
