# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares, while all other Countryside Survey (CS) data remains publicly accessible.
- The aim is to maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- The Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality protects the integrity of the sampling strategy, the environment, and future landowner permission to survey.
- Public interest justification; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access levels and release conditions
- Approximate location (to determine whether squares fall within predefined areas) can be identified; four-digit grid references may be released under licence to indicate the 10x10 km grid, not precise locations.
- Six-digit (precise) grid references are only considered in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing precise locations.
- Spatial data within survey squares could enable locating a square and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- Licences for location data are finite, for specific projects, and data must not be retained for other purposes.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
- No data should be used to plan visits, check landowner compliance, or identify exact square locations; if in doubt, consult CEH.
- If requested, evidence of project management standards equivalent to JCOP may be required.

## Licensing and responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, decides on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with clauses reflecting policy; licences must be signed by an authorised representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under applicable Acts and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report summarising access applications and decision grounds.
- For internal partner use, CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support; external requests are dealt with case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid as negotiated.

## Implications for data leaders
- Incorporate robust access controls and licensing to protect sensitive location data while enabling legitimate use.
- Balance data utility with confidentiality to sustain future surveys and landowner goodwill.
- Establish clear governance for exceptional access decisions, pre-processing options, and annual reporting.
- Ensure metadata and awareness of data sensitivity are aligned with policy to guide users and prevent misuse.
- Coordinate with data owners and the wider data community to maintain a sustainable, trusted data ecosystem.
