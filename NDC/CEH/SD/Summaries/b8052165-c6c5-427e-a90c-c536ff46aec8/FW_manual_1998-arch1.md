Contract Report (non-refereed) Furse, M. T.; Dawson, F.H.; Henville, P.; Irons, G.P.; Gunn, R.J.M.; Winder, J. M.. 1998 Countryside Survey 2000. Module 2: survey of freshwater habitats. Field handbook v.2.0

## Overview
- Field handbook for Countryside Survey 2000 Module 2: survey of freshwater habitats.
- Documents historical context, sampling framework, field procedures, and data capture for freshwater habitat assessment.
- Modules include aquatic macro-invertebrates, River Habitat Survey (RHS), diatoms, and chironomid pupal exuviae, plus macrophyte transects.

## Aims and scope
- Provide standardized methods to collect comparable data across GB for monitoring ecological change and informing policy.
- Support identification of patterns, correlations, and potential predictions about freshwater habitat condition.

## Sampling framework and scale
- Builds on three NERC surveys (1977/78, 1984, Countryside Survey 1990) using the ITE Land Classification System.
- Sampling unit: 1 x 1 km square; repeated sampling to create time-series data.
- CS1990 involved 508 squares; CS2000 adds 30 new squares and up to 60 more sites for timeseries and country-level estimates.
- Two-tier approach to link field ground-truth data with remote sensing (satellite imagery) for land-cover mapping.
- Emphasis on standardizing field procedures to reduce observer-driven variation.

## Data collection components
- Five main elements:
  - Aquatic macro-invertebrate survey (RIVPACS-compatible)
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS; includes alder disease and chemical surveys)
  - Diatom survey
  - Chironomid pupal exuviae survey (CPET-based approach)
  - Ecofact-type macrophyte transects (up to five 10 m x 2 m transects per square)
- Fieldwork conducted by IFE surveyors with follow-on RHS and SERCON data collection by ITE teams.
- Data and metadata intended to be discoverable and usable, with detailed field forms and mapping.

## Planning, site visits, permissions
- Each 1 km square selected for survey visits; IFE coordinates with ITE to plan visits within four weeks of prior survey.
- Landowner permission required; letters sent in advance; advance contact encouraged but not always possible.
- Detailed coordination: six ITE labs, with project leaders managing square lists, access, and reporting.
- Procedures for denied access: follow-up reporting and potential square replacement.

## Equipment and field logistics
- Comprehensive equipment list (sampling nets, containers, fixatives, PPE, GPS, maps, cameras, safety gear).
- Emphasis on standard grafting of equipment, careful labelling, and cross-site compatibility.
- Standard fixative: 10% formalin solution; field storage in labelled pots and trays; chain of custody practices for transport.

## Macroinvertebrate sampling protocol
- Primary method: three minutes of pond-net sampling, targeting multiple habitats proportionally.
- Follow-up: one minute of manual search; 10% of sites include replicate samples for quality control.
- Sampling at replicate sites may alternate between surveyors to test inter- and intra-operator variability.
- Environmental data collected for the full sampling area (width, depth, substratum, flow, etc.).
- Sample handling: labels with site, date, square; multiple bags/pots as needed; fixatives added to preserve specimens.
- Procedures for preventing cross-contamination; strict labelling and storage in stacking trays.
- Processing protocols aligned with RIVPACS methodology; emphasis on comparability over taxonomic completeness.

## River Habitat Survey (RHS)
- RHS standard 500 m reach centered on macro-invertebrate sampling point where possible.
- Data collected via a structured form (with spot-checks every ~50 m) covering:
  - Background map data (altitude, slope, flow category, planform, etc.)
  - Field details (site number, GPS, dates, accreditation)
  - Predominant valley form, riffles/pools/point bars counts, and channel features
  - Banktop land-use and vegetation structure (within 5–10 m buffers)
  - Channel vegetation types and riparian conditions
  - Land-use within 50 m of river, bank profiles, trees and woody debris
  - Channel dimensions and artificial features (weirs, revetments, embankments, etc.)
  - Notable features, species observations, and alder disease status
- Integration with SERCON, allowing extended assessment of conservation value.
- Photography requirements to aid site re-location and condition assessment.

## SERCON framework and integration
- SERCON component assesses conservation value across planform, channel profile, recovery from past alterations, and naturalness of bank and riparian vegetation.
- Part of RHS data plus a separate SERCON component forms a complete river survey when used together.
- Outputs enable assessment of naturalness, recovery, and potential restoration opportunities, with emphasis on 500 m reaches and conditional 50 m RHS segments.

## Data handling, quality control, and replication
- Training and accreditation required for RHS surveyors; regular team rotation to preserve consistency.
- Quality control includes 10% replicate sampling, audits of RHS surveys, and ongoing proficiency checks.
- Emphasis on maintaining complete, legible field forms and consistent site references; data standardization for cross-site comparability.

## Safety, permissions, and field protocols
- Emphasis on health and safety across all field activities; lone worker considerations and mandatory protective equipment.
- Leptospirosis awareness, proper handling of formalin, and appropriate first-aid/eye-wash readiness.
- Permissions and landowner liaison protocols; mandatory identification and courteous conduct with landowners.
- Fieldwork on contaminated sites requires additional precautions and site-specific COSHH assessments.

## Key outcomes for data integration
- A structured, standardised data collection framework enabling temporal analyses, cross-site comparisons, and integration with satellite-derived land cover data.
- Foundation for correlations between habitat structure, biotic communities (macroinvertebrates, diatoms, chironomids), and conservation/value indices (SERCON) at national scale.
- Data products intended for policy support, environmental planning, and biodiversity management across England, Scotland, and Wales.
