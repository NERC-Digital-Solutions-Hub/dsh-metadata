# CS2007 Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey

- A comprehensive field-guidance document for Countryside Survey 2007 focusing on headwater streams and pond condition, detailing data collection, handling, and quality control to support cross-topic data exploration and product creation.

## Scope and aims

- Covers headwater stream surveys (425 CS2000 squares re-surveyed in CS2007; 500 m RHS stretches; macroinvertebrate sampling, hydromorphology, aquatic plants, and water chemistry).
- Includes pond condition assessment across squares with ponds (survey pond selection, macrophyte surveys, environmental data, water chemistry, and pond management/usage data).
- Emphasizes standardized, auditable data collection to enable cross-topic analysis and national-scale comparisons.

## Data collection framework and survey components

- Headwater survey elements (CS2007 Headwaters):
  - Macroinvertebrate community sampling (RIVPACS method) and associated environmental data (RIVPACS Sample Area Form).
  - Hydromorphological assessment (River Habitat Survey, RHS) using 2003 Environment Agency protocol, entered on-site via RAPID.
  - Aquatic plant community survey (MTR method) and water chemistry sampling (pH, conductivity in field; SRP, TON, alkalinity via on-site filtration).
  - 500 m RHS reach centered on macroinvertebrate site; 10 spot-checks with comprehensive data capture; 50 m upstream/downstream aquatic plant stretch for MTR; RHS data entered in RAPID.
  - Photographs and sketch maps for relocation and habitat characterization; detailed environmental variables (substrate, width, depth, velocity, bank features, shading, etc.).
- Pond condition survey (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey):
  - Pond mapping and boundary delineation; survey pond selection; macrophyte survey within outer pond boundary; 100 m MTR-like macrophyte assessment including submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species; shading by overhanging vegetation.
  - Water turbidity estimation, water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity), drawdown height, and pond area estimation.
  - Environmental data, inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, surrounding land use, amenity value, and pond management/grazing/waterbird/fish/amphibian observations.
  - Detailed field sheets and data capture forms (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets 1–3) plus accompanying photographs and sketches.

## Data capture tools and workflow

- On-site data entry systems:
  - RHS data: RAPID (River Habitat Survey field data entry system) on Tablet PC; 17 sections across 4 pages; built-in data validation before leaving site.
  - Aquatic plants: IRIS (aquatic plant survey data entry system) on Tablet PC; 2-page form with plant list, species covers, and physical site data; integrated sample tracking and validation.
- Macroinvertebrate sampling protocol:
  - Standardised three-minute kick-net sampling plus a mandatory one-minute manual search; proportional habitat sampling within a defined 5–15 m sampling area; avoidance of cross-contamination; fixation with 4% formaldehyde equivalent; detailed labeling and packing (Pots, bags, PVC taping, TREM transport cards).
  - Full environmental data collection within the sampling area (width, depth, substrate, habitats, shading, water chemistry).
  - Use of RIVPACS for downstream bioassessment; RIVPACS Sample Area Form to capture precise reach metrics and sampling details.
- Macrophyte survey and taxonomy:
  - MTR-based 100 m macrophyte survey (centered on macroinvertebrate sampling point) with systematic percentage-cover estimation for each species, plus overall channel cover; species enumerated and identified to species level where possible; identification guidance and sampling for difficult taxa (e.g., Ranunculus, Callitriche, Potamogeton, Charophytes) with lab confirmation when needed.
  - Specimens may be collected for identification; guidelines for pressing, preservation (pickle in alcohol), and voucher handling; detailed species lists and cover categorization (dominant to rare).
- Pond condition data capture:
  - Field mapping and boundary sketch; photographic documentation; boundary and outline delineation; pond area estimation by pacing and shape approximation; drawdown height measurements; turbidity estimation; water chemistry sampling and documentation; assessment of pollution, inflows/outflows, and surrounding land use.
  - Recording sheets cover water quality, environmental survey, pond macrophyte survey, and post-survey data checks; inclusion of TREM transport cards and monthly dispatch schedule to CEH Dorset.

## Data quality, validation, and governance

- On-site validation:
  - RAPID and IRIS include built-in checks that validate data completeness and consistency; errors are surfaced one at a time to enable immediate correction.
  - All RHS and plant surveys require validation before leaving site; “This RHS survey appears to be complete” or “This plant survey appears to be complete” confirmations.
- Training and audits:
  - Field survey teams include Environment Agency RHS accreditation; regular interchange of team members to maintain technique consistency.
  - Approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; field surveys accompanied by CEH staff when needed.
- Field survey checklist:
  - A joint completion checklist ensures all tasks are completed (photos, site maps, data sheets, etc.) before departure.
- Sample transportation and storage:
  - Macroinvertebrate samples stored in labeled pots within transport boxes, with TREM cards for hazardous materials.
  - Samples dispatched monthly in organized boxes to CEH Dorset for processing; plant specimens returned as required.
- Data integration and sharing:
  - Data collected via RAPID and IRIS feed into national data repositories; PEER-reviewed QA and cross-dataset comparability through standardized methods.

## Practical considerations and challenges

- Time and data availability:
  - The need to “understand the ask” and align data collection with varying team capabilities and data availability across topics.
- Patchy data and multi-system access:
  - Data from several systems (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR, water chemistry) across multiple formats and coordinates; standardized forms mitigate inconsistencies.
- Communication of complex results:
  - Protocols emphasize clear field documentation, relocation sketches, and photos to enable robust data reuse and cross-site comparisons.
- Rare species handling:
  - Special guidance on rare species confirmation, licensing for Schedule 8 species, and lab-based confirmation for difficult taxa.

## Outputs and products

- Data products stem from integrated field data:
  - RIVPACS-based macroinvertebrate community assessments with site environmental data.
  - RHS-derived hydromorphological indices and 500 m reach descriptions.
  - MTR macrophyte community presence and % cover for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plants.
  - Pond condition indicators including turbidity, water chemistry, pond area, inflows/outflows, land-use context, and amenity value.
- relocation and site documentation:
  - Sketch maps and photographs with marker boards; NGR coordinates captured for precise future relocation.
- Sample handling and traceability:
  - Detailed labeling and sample archiving ensure traceability back to CS square and pond/macroinvertebrate sampling site.
