# Countryside Survey 2000. Module 2: survey of freshwater habitats. Field handbook v.2.0

- Purpose of the handbook: standardise field methods for collecting comparable freshwater habitat data to support policy, biodiversity monitoring, and landscape-scale analyses.

## Data Components and Measurements

- Macro-invertebrates (RIVPACS): standardized sampling of a single 5–15 m stream area using pond-nets and manual searches; fixation in formalin; environmental data collected; full labelling and chain-of-custody procedures.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS): 500 m reach centered on the macro-invertebrate site; includes alder disease and chemical surveys; spot-checks every ~50 m; channel dimensions, bank/top vegetation, land use, and other physical features recorded.
- Diatoms and Chironomid pupal exuviae: collected near the macro-invertebrate site; diatom samples processed on-site; exuviae collected and fixed for CPET/SERCON analyses.
- Ecofact-type macrophyte survey: recording floral composition along stream transects.
- SERCON component: optional additional recording to evaluate conservation value, including planform, recovery, vegetation naturalness, and bank riparian features.
- Other outputs: photographs and site boards to aid re-location; environmental data forms detailing measurements and substratum categories.

## Sampling Design and Coverage

- CS2000 core sampling: 435 1-km squares across England, Scotland, Wales, plus Isle of Man adjustments; repeat sampling of CS1990 squares to maintain timeseries; 30 additional squares for country-unit estimates; up to 568 total planned in CS2000.
- Sampling framework within squares:
  - 1990 squares: re-surveyed where watercourses exist; macro-invertebrate site marked as M; reserve sites MRn used if M is dry.
  - New squares: primary M site plus reserve MR sites as backups; RHS and other surveys centered on M (or MR) site.
- Site visits: two-field-team coordination; alignment of planning between ITE and IFE; aim to survey the 1 km squares in a consistent sequence to maintain comparability.
- Housekeeping: use of 1:10,000 and 1:50,000 maps; precise site marking for RHS 50 m reach and macro-invertebrate sites; fixed procedures to standardize sampling effort across habitats.

## Data Collection Procedures (Quality and Documentation)

- Field forms and labeling:
  - Detailed data capture on square, land class, date, position, sampling method, and site codes (e.g., M, MR, D for diatoms, C for chironomid exuviae).
  - On reverse map, field surveyors record sampling details, environmental parameters, and exact locations.
  - Photographs with chalkboards indicating site type and sample identity for re-location.
- Sampling protocol specifics:
  - Macro-invertebrate sampling: 3 minutes of pond-net sampling plus 1 minute of manual search; replicate samples at 10% of sites; chemical and diatom samples collected upstream of invertebrate sampling when possible.
  - Environmental data: width, depth, substratum, current velocity (categorical/estimated), and percent cover of substratum types (silt, bedrock, moss, algae, etc.) across the full sampling area.
  - Substratum coding follows Wentworth scale; visual estimates calibrated against benchmarks to reduce inter-observer variability.
- Sample handling and transport:
  - Fixation in 10% formalin; careful labeling with external waterproof labels; storage in large retaining pots or stacking trays; transport in sealed containers with fixative; maintain chain-of-custody and COSHH compliance.
  - Equipment care: nets, pots, forceps, markers, and storage trays maintained and repaired as needed; damage reported promptly.
- Analytical alignment:
  - RHS and SERCON components aligned with Environment Agency manuals; RIVPACS-compatible data collection aims for comparability across sites and surveys.
  - Replicates and inter-/intra-operator checks to quantify variability; regular team swaps to standardize technique.

## Data Management, Quality Control, and Training

- Training and accreditation:
  - RHS surveyors must be accredited; RHS coordinators provide training and re-accreditation (valid three years).
  - Field teams receive training in macro-invertebrate, diatom, exuviae, and chemical sampling; periodic audits and refresher activities.
- Quality control measures:
  - Ten percent of flowing-water sites included as replicates; 7% of RHS surveys audited by senior staff.
  - Inter- and intra-operator variability assessed through replicate sampling by different surveyors.
  - Team rotation to prevent technique drift; ongoing procedural updates to preserve comparability.
- Documentation and reproducibility:
  - Clear labelling of all samples, with replicate sample designations (first, second, replicate).
  - Field and laboratory procedures documented to ensure repeatability and regulatory compliance.

## Permissions, Access, and Safety

- Permissions and land access:
  - Landowner consent sought prior to surveys; advance letters and on-site verification of access and permission requirements.
  - Clear procedures for denied access, including abandoning or adjusting sampling plans and notifying supervisors.
- Safety and lone-working:
  - Adherence to field safety guidelines, including life jackets, appropriate PPE, and lone-worker codes of practice.
  - Health considerations include leptospirosis risk awareness, gloves, barrier creams, eyewash, and first-aid readiness.
  - Safety during fieldwork emphasized in all appendices, with emergency reporting procedures and equipment checks.

## Data Products, Use, and Impact

- Data products enable self-serve exploration via dashboards and maps, support policy development, and feed biodiversity action plans.
- Relevance and use cases:
  - Supporting national and international policy frameworks (Rio Declaration, Agenda 21; Biodiversity Action Plans; Habitats Directives; CAP-related environmental schemes).
  - Providing ground-truth data to link satellite/remote-sensing data with field observations; informing habitat classification and trend analysis.
  - Longitudinal data to monitor changes in countryside habitat quality, hydromorphology, and riparian ecosystems.
- Output integration:
  - RHS and SERCON data feed conservation planning and habitat assessments; time-series data allow assessment of changes between 1990, 1998 (CS2000) and beyond.

## Notable Challenges and Considerations for Data Support

- Time spent understanding the ask and aligning outputs with user needs.
- Dealing with patchy, multi-format data across different systems and observers.
- Ensuring clear, simple communication of complex ecological information to end users.
- Promoting outputs to maximize reuse, visibility, and impact, while maintaining data provenance.
