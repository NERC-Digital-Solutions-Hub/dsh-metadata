# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim and scope
  - Maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
  - Public-interest rationale; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- When and how location data can be released
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to indicate which grid squares contain CS squares.
  - Six-digit (precise) locations: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may preprocess data to avoid needing to release precise locations; external release requires a licence and demonstration that the IP of the requester carries equal/higher confidentiality.
  - Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
  - Licensed releases must not enable visits to squares or help identify landowners; use must be strictly for approved projects.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and limit access to authorized individuals.
  - Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at licence end.
  - No third-party sharing that could compromise confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data cannot be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
  - For six-digit releases, licensees may need evidence of JCOP-equivalent project management.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but are not required to meet the higher IP confidentiality threshold of six-digit releases.
  - Licences for four-digit/grid/spatial data include a clause preventing attempts to deduce precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and processes
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; approvals signed by a senior authority.
  - If approval is denied, CEH follows Act/Regulations procedures and supports the decision.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe for internal CS-partner use; case-by-case for external requests.
  - Partners and potential data users are strongly advised to consult CEH before using data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case by case.

- Policy implications for analysts
  - Prefer licensing that permits four-digit grid releases or CEH-performed preprocessing to avoid exposing precise locations.
  - Plan data projects with CEH early to ensure compliant access and processing.
  - Understand that precise location data are tightly controlled and require exceptional justification and governance.
