# Countryside Survey 2000. Module 2: survey of freshwater habitats. Field handbook v.2.0

- Purpose andAim
  - Use standardized, time-series data to demonstrate environmental condition and monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Provide a consistent, auditable framework for freshwater habitat monitoring across GB, enabling scrutiny and comparison over time.

- Study design and scope
  - Part of Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000), Module 2: Survey of freshwater habitats.
  - Sampling framework built on CS1990 design; CS1990 sampled 508 1-km squares across the UK; CS2000 adds 30 new squares to improve country-unit estimates and remote sensing linkage.
  - Field teams will sample about 435 1-km squares for one or more components; total potential sampling covers 435 squares in CS2000.
  - Primary components:
    - Aquatic macro-invertebrate survey (RIVPACS)
    - River Habitat Survey (RHS; includes alder disease and diagnostic chemical surveys)
    - Diatom survey
    - Chironomid pupal exuviae survey (CPET/RIVPACS-compatible)
    - Ecofact-type macrophyte survey (flora along up to five 10 m × 2 m transects per square)

- Data collection and outputs
  - Data organized to support tracking of land use, landscape features, and aquatic biota, enabling outputs such as ecological health against standards and policy indicators.
  - Emphasis on ground-truthing with field procedures that couple bottom-up field data with top-down data (e.g., satellite imagery and land cover maps) to improve pattern detection.
  - Standardized data collection formats and storage practices; all field datasets to be uploaded to appropriate portals.

- Field procedures and planning
  - Field visits planned to target squares with known watercourses; follow a four-week window for site visits where possible.
  - Existing 1990 sampling squares to be re-surveyed (with two Isle of Man replacements) plus up to 30 new squares to support country estimates.
  - Site visits coordinated between Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) and Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE); six ITE lab coordinators manage field teams.
  - To ensure consistency and timeseries integrity, new surveys maintain the same order and sampling windows as 1990 where feasible.

- Data collection methods (macroinvertebrates, RHS, diatoms, CPET exuviae, macrophytes)
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
    - Standard three-minute pond-net sampling plus one minute of manual searching; replicate sampling at 10% of sites for quality control.
    - Environmental data collected concurrently for the entire 50 m reach around the sampling point; full 500 m RHS reach documented separately.
    - Sample labeling, storage, and fixative practices standardized to ensure comparability and traceability.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - 500 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site (or reserve site if M is unavailable); assesses geomorphology, flow types, banktop land-use, vegetation structure, and channel vegetation.
    - Spot-checks every ~50 m along the reach; sweep-up documentation at the end of the 500 m section.
    - Accreditation required for RHS surveyors; data collected on standardized RHS forms (Part Three) with accompanying spot-check key.
  - Diatoms and chironomid pupal exuviae
    - Diatom sampling near the macroinvertebrate point (upstream when possible); five replicate gravel grabs as a backup if needed.
    - Chironomid pupal exuviae sampling from adjacent areas; CPET methodology explained for light to high-flow conditions.
  - Ecofact macrophyte survey
    - Recording floral composition along up to five 10 m × 2 m transects within each square, including management of vegetation types and competition with other habitat features.
  - Data quality and comparability
    - 10% replicate sampling across flowing sites; inter- and intra-operator variability assessed by alternating survey teams.
    - Standardized sampling techniques derived from established protocols (e.g., Murray-Bligh et al., 1997) and Environment Agency RHS/SERCON guidance.
    - Approximately 7% RHS survey audits conducted by experienced IFE staff.

- Data handling, labeling, and storage
  - All samples labeled externally with square/land class notation, date, and sample type; internal labels and external markings must align.
  - Sample containers designed for transport and preservation (formalin fixatives used; 10% formalin as field fixative; formaldehyde-handling safety and COSHH considerations emphasized).
  - Samples stored in rigid, labelled containers or stacking trays; transport and courier considerations addressed (e.g., some couriers may not accept formalin).
  - Documentation includes field forms, environmental data sheets, site photographs, and maps (1:10,000 and 1:50,000 OS maps) showing sampling sites and land ownership.

- Equipment and safety
  - Comprehensive field equipment list (nets, bottles, fixatives, sample pots, labels, GIS/GPS tools, cameras, safety gear, PPE, etc.).
  - Safety emphasis on field operations: life jackets for water work, PPE for chemical handling, lone worker precautions, emergency communications, first-aid readiness, and COSHH compliance.
  - Formaldehyde handling protocols, transport rules, and spill response procedures included; field staff receive training in safe handling and site-specific hazards.
  - Special attention to access permissions, landowner engagement, and professional conduct during surveys.

- Permissions, access, and landowner relations
  - Pre-survey landowner notification with advance letters; sighting and verification of access on the survey day.
  - Procedures for denied access: abandon site or adjust sampling plan; replace squares where access is denied.
  - Emphasis on courteous conduct, identification, and adherence to landowner wishes at all times.

- RHS and SERCON frameworks
  - RHS provides standardized field procedures for river morphology, habitat quality, and sampling integration with SERCON (System for Evaluating Rivers for Conservation).
  - SERCON component adds an assessment of conservation value, planform changes, recovery, and naturalness of riparian vegetation and bank flora.
  - Data collected supports SERCON scoring (I-IX) and the evaluation of river stewardship, with guidance for recording impacts and special features.

- Timetable and deliverables
  - Data generated to feed national and regional environmental monitoring programs; outputs designed to inform policy obligations under international, EU, and national frameworks (e.g., Rio/Agenda 21, Biodiversity Action Plans, Habitats/Species Directives).
  - Data standardization and transparency designed to enable scrutiny and policy evaluation over time.

- End-user emphasis for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Emphasizes consistent, high-quality datasets suitable for long-term monitoring and policy evaluation.
  - Standardized methods enable comparability across years, sites, and data layers, supporting integrated environmental health assessments.
  - Clear guidance on improving dataset value by linking field data with satellite imagery and land cover maps, thus enabling broader analyses and cross-data collaborations.
  - Focus on data accessibility, quality assurance, and transparent documentation to support government, agencies, and NGOs in environmental decision-making.
