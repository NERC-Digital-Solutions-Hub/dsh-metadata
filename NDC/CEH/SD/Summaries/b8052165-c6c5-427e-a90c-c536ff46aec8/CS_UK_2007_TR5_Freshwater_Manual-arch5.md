# Headwaters

## Purpose and context
- Documentation for the Headwaters component of the Countryside Survey 2007, detailing field methods, data capture, quality control, and data flow for headwater streams and related sampling.
- Connects with broader CS2007 activities (RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling, River Habitat Survey RHS, aquatic macrophyte surveys, and water chemistry) and supports data integration across multiple datasets.

## Data collection and data capture systems
- Field data are collected using standardized digital tools to ensure consistency across sites:
  - RAPID: field data entry for River Habitat Survey (RHS) and associated hydromorphological/environmental data; 500 m RHS sections centered on macroinvertebrate sites; data validation on-site with iterative checks.
  - IRIS: field data entry for aquatic macrophyte (MTR) surveys; supports plant species lists, abundance, and physical site data; on-site validation.
  - RIVPACS Sample Area Form: dedicated form for macroinvertebrate sampling area data, water chemistry readings, substrate and habitat characterizations, and photographs.
- Data flows culminate in on-site validation and subsequent transfer to CEH Dorset for processing; samples (invertebrates and plant specimens) are couriered to CEH with strict labeling and packaging.

## Sampling and data scope
- Headwaters re-survey plan for CS2007 includes:
  - All 425 CS2000 squares: macroinvertebrate sampling, RIVPACS environmental variables, RHS hydromorphology data, water chemistry.
  - For 25 newly sampled headwater sites: additional sampling on smaller watercourses.
  - Aquatic plant surveys (MTR) within a 100 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling point.
- Methods emphasize comparability with CS1990/CS2000 and compatibility with RIVPACS and RHS protocols (2003 RHS version).

## Data standards and metadata
- Key fields and identifiers:
  - CS square numbers, pond/square identifiers, GPS/NGR coordinates (8-digit precision), sample dates, surveyors’ initials, and accreditation codes.
  - On RHS/RIVPACS data: sample area dimensions, width/depth/velocity categories, substrate type, bank/top vegetation, channel shading, and water clarity.
- Data are captured using controlled vocabularies and drop-down menus to minimize free-text errors; on-site validation ensures completeness before leaving the site.

## Quality control and assurance
- Multiple layers of QA:
  - Surveyors hold Environment Agency RHS certificates; teams trained in RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling and MTR plant surveying; periodic team rotations to maintain consistency.
  - Approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; field checklists completed collaboratively by both surveyors.
  - On-site data validation via RAPID/IRIS; data must pass all checks before leaving the site (e.g., RHS validation, plant survey validation).
- Field survey checklist ensures completion of all tasks (RHS, macroinvertebrate, aquatic plants, water quality, photography, mapping).

## Data management, storage, and transport
- Sample handling and transport:
  - Macroinvertebrate samples and plant specimens stored at CEH until shipment; standard packaging in labeled pots/bags; use of 40% formalin, PVC tape-sealed pots, and TREM transport cards for hazardous materials.
  - Shipments organized in boxes with 6–8 pots per box to CEH Dorset; notify CEH by email with box contents; plant specimens sent to Pond Conservation as needed.
- Documentation and records:
  - RIVPACS Sample Area Form records site, date, GPS, sampling method, habitat data, water chemistry readings, and photos; field sketch maps accompany macroinvertebrate sampling data for relocation.
  - Photographs required for macroinvertebrate area, RHS reach, and MTR 100 m plant survey with marker boards identifying sample areas.
- Pond and macrophyte components:
  - CS2007 Pond Condition Survey provides separate, detailed sheets for pond mapping, environmental survey, and macrophyte survey (species lists, abundance scales, substrate and shade assessments, and surrounding land use).

## Interoperability and workflow integration
- Data workflows are designed for integration across RHS, RIVPACS, and MTR components:
  - RHS/RIVPACS data in RAPID; aquatic plant data in IRIS; macroinvertebrate sampling data linked through RIVPACS forms.
  - Observed across 2003 RHS protocol updates, with data entry aligned to on-site validation to improve quality and comparability with CS2000/CS1990 datasets.
- Field data are intended to be exportable to central databases (CEH Dorset) for processing and long-term storage.

## Particular challenges and considerations
- Recognized data governance and interoperability challenges:
  - Use of multiple systems and formats (RAPID, IRIS, paper forms) requiring careful data harmonization.
  - Dependence on timely data submission to CEH Dorset; rigorous labeling and handling required to protect sample integrity.
  - Ensuring consistent interpretation of site features (habitats, substrates, shading) across teams and over time.
- The document acknowledges ongoing need to balance user needs, timely access, and standardization across large, diverse datasets.

## Outputs and datasets produced
- Datasets and outputs include:
  - Macroinvertebrate community data and RIVPACS-derived environmental variables.
  - River Habitat Survey hydromorphological data and site environmental measurements.
  - Water chemistry data (conductivity, pH, SRP, TON, alkalinity) from headwater sites.
  - Aquatic macrophyte (MTR) survey data, including species lists, abundance, and coverage estimates.
  - Macrophyte sketches, photographs, and associated location data for relocation.
  - Pond condition data (mapping, environmental characteristics, and macrophyte surveys) where applicable.

## End notes and references
- Methods and standards draw on established CS2000/CS1990 practices and Environment Agency River Habitat Survey (RHS) guidance (2003 version) and MTR framework (Holmes et al. 1999).
- Opportunities for improvement include continued data harmonization across RHS, RIVPACS, and MTR platforms and robust on-site validation to maintain data quality across CS2007 operations.
