# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Governs access to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- These elements are essential to the survey’s scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission from landowners for surveying.
- Policy aims to protect public interest; requests are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When locations may be released and at what precision
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence to help identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing by CEH to avoid release; VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may allow external release under licence if the requester demonstrates legal protection of IP at least equal to CS data.
- Spatial data from within squares (maps of habitats, etc.) could indirectly reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit references.
- Four-digit releases do not require the higher IP confidentiality level needed for six-digit releases, but still must comply with licence terms.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite and for specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- At licence end, licensees must confirm destruction of data.
- No data or derivatives should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult CEH if unsure.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or assess landowner compliance; not to identify exact square locations.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- 4-digit licence terms are similar to 6-digit, but do not require the same IP confidentiality threshold; a clause prohibits attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under relevant Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS partnership use, CEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis within reasonable timeframes; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before using CS location data to help define requirements and determine appropriate use; CEH may provide support as part of collaboration or paid services, negotiated case-by-case.
