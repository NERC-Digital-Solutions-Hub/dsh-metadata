# Headwaters

- Provides the headwaters component of Countryside Survey 2007, detailing design, methods, data capture, and quality assurance for GB headwater streams across CS squares.
- Integrates macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS), aquatic plant surveys (MTR macrophyte method), River Habitat Survey (RHS), and water chemistry within a standardized field workflow.
- Aims to survey all 425 CS2000 squares (headwater streams) and to sample a randomly selected pond within each CS2007 square containing ponds.

## Survey design and scope

- Headwater sampling framework
  - Re-survey 425 squares from CS2000; elements to re-survey per square include macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, hydromorphological and physical characteristics, and a water chemistry sample.
  - In 25 of the 425 squares, sample a new site on a smaller watercourse to replace an unsuitable CS2000 site.
  - Each headwater sampling site comprises a 500 m watercourse stretch for RHS (with RHS spot-checks and sampling alignment described).
  - Aquatic plant surveys: a randomly selected 100 m reach around the macroinvertebrate sampling area to survey plant communities and assess cover.
- Pond sampling (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey)
  - For squares containing ponds, ponds are mapped and a survey pond is selected for condition assessment (macrophytes, environmental characteristics, water chemistry) with standardized field procedures.

## Data collection components

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
  - Sample area: continuous stream-bed habitat, typically 5–15 m; aim for proportional habitat sampling; three-minute active pond-net sampling plus one minute of manual searching.
  - Net: standard 25 cm2 pond-net with 900 µm mesh; thorough net cleaning between sites.
  - Handling: retain all specimens for lab identification except fish/amphibians and clearly identified rare species; return live sizeable taxa where appropriate.
  - Lab data: samples recorded on RIVPACS Sample Area Form; environmental data captured in-field on the form.
  - Sample storage and fixation: transfer to 18" x 12" bags; add 40% formalin to reach ~4% formaldehyde; label with CS square, pond sample details.
  - Data areas: width, depth, velocity, substrate, and other habitat data collected in the field; photographs of sampling area and features for relocation.
- Water chemistry
  - Indicative chemical sample at each watercourse; field measurements of conductivity and pH (hand-held meters).
  - Filtered water samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity using disposable syringe filters; 50 ml bottles labeled with project and square information; samples sent to CEH laboratory with standard information sheets.
- RHS (River Habitat Survey) data
  - 500 m RHS section centered on the macroinvertebrate site; uses 2003 RHS protocol.
  - Data captured via RAPID (field digital data entry) with 17 sections across 4 pages; on-site validation required before leaving.
  - Spot-checks (10) plus summary vegetation and extra substrates, plus 500 m sweep-up data (land-use, channel features, etc.).
  - RAPID provides checks for empty fields and internal consistency; data is stored in an Access database with on-site validation.
- Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR)
  - 100 m reach around the macroinvertebrate site; walk/wade to record presence and percent cover of macrophytes and bryophytes on a 9-point scale; use grapnels to sample submerged plants when necessary.
  - Plant identification to species level where possible; specimens collected for lab confirmation when required, with guidelines for rare taxa and fragile taxa.
  - Data captured in IRIS (field plant data entry); 2-page form, with specimen management and lab submission guidance.
  - Macrophyte data include submerged, floating-leaved, emergent categories; species list organized by major groups; percentage cover estimates across the 100 m reach.
- Data handling and platforms
  - RHS: RAPID (River Habitat Survey) for RHS data entry; on-site validation and data export to central database.
  - Macrophytes: IRIS for plant data entry; specimen handling and lab confirmation workflows.
  - All field notes and survey notes linked to survey records; on-site photographs incorporated into data records.

## Field procedures and protocols

- Habitat sampling strategy
  - Ensure sampling area reflects modal conditions; avoid atypical features (boulders, narrows) when measuring environmental variables.
  - Record proportional habitat distribution and substrate composition across the full sampling length.
- Photographs
  - Required photos: macroinvertebrate sampling area, RHS reach, and aquatic plant survey reach; include fixed marker boards to facilitate relocation.
- Transportation and sample handling
  - Macroinvertebrate samples and plant specimens transported with appropriate fixatives; TREM transport cards accompany fixative-containing boxes; samples couriered to CEH Dorset when a sufficient quantity has accumulated.
- Pond mapping and condition survey workflow
  - Mapping in CS2000; pond boundary delineation by winter water level; survey pond selected; two surveyors working together for safety and data validation.
  - Document pond characteristics: turbidity estimate, water chemistry, drawdown height, area, sediment composition, inflows/outflows, management actions, land use around pond, and amenity value.
  - Macrophyte survey within pond boundary; abundance estimates for each species; specimen collection for difficult identifications; rare species flagged for expert confirmation or photographic verification.
  - Data capture and submission: pond field sheets, plant specimens, and water samples sent to Pond Conservation; standard packaging and labeling procedures.

## Data quality, training, and governance

- Personnel and training
  - Each surveyor holds relevant RHS/RIVPACS/MTR training certificates; regular cross-team rotation to maintain consistency.
- Quality control and audits
  - Approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; field teams may be accompanied for progress checks and QA.
- Field survey checklist
  - At end of site visit, both surveyors complete a field survey checklist to ensure all tasks completed.
- Validation and data integrity
  - On-site validation via RAPID and IRIS before leaving site; data checks ensure completeness and internal consistency; digital data storage facilitates subsequent data handling.

## Equipment and safety

- Equipment list (high-level)
  - Field safety gear, navigation tools, aerial photographs, pond nets, sample bottles, 40% formaldehyde, grapnels for macrophytes, GPS, rangefinders, clipboards, and field data entry devices (Tablet PCs) for RAPID/IRIS.
- Health and safety
  - Emphasis on standard water-safety guidelines; risk assessment for sampling sites; high-risk conditions may warrant postponement of sampling.
  - Two-person teams recommended for headwater surveys due to safety considerations.

## Data management and dissemination

- Data capture platforms
  - RHS data input via RAPID; macrophyte data via IRIS; macroinvertebrate data via RIVPACS forms.
- Data archiving and transport
  - Samples and field sheets regularly dispatched to CEH and Pond Conservation; maintain documentation for traceability, including CS square, pond code, date, and surveyor.
- Reporting and use
  - Data support national-scale assessments of headwater streams; integration across biological (RIVPACS, MTR) and physical (RHS) indicators enables analyses of hydromorphological condition, stream ecology, and macroalgal/macrophyte communities.

## Pond Condition Survey (CS2007) – condensed workflow

- Identification and mapping
  - Ponds mapped by mappers; outer pond boundary defined by winter water level; ponds recorded in a CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet.
- Survey pond selection and dual surveying
  - In each square with ponds, select one survey pond for macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry surveys.
  - Two surveyors deployed for safety; field practices aligned with standard health and safety guidelines.
- Survey steps
  - Photograph pond with square number; identify outer boundary; sketch outline and estimate pond area; measure drawdown height; estimate proportion of water present.
  - Take turbidity estimate and water chemistry samples if water is present; otherwise document limitations.
  - Macrophyte survey within pond boundary; record species presence and abundance categories; gather specimens for lab ID confirmation when needed.
  - Fill in environmental survey fields (land use around pond, inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, grazing, waterbird and fish/amphibian indicators, and amenity use).
- Lab handling and specimen transport
  - Preserved plant specimens sent to Pond Conservation; aquatic invertebrate samples fixed and prepared for CEH Dorset analysis; standardized labeling and packaging for transport.

## Challenges and considerations for analysts

- Local-scale data gaps and accessibility
  - Field data are gathered across many habitats and scales; some data may be sparse at local levels, requiring careful extrapolation and cross-walk with RHS/RIVPACS/MTR data.
- Data integration and standardization
  - Harmonizing data from multiple subsystems (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR, IRIS, RAPID) requires robust metadata and consistent coding to enable downstream analyses and modelling.
- Data quality and field variability
  - Substrate estimates, habitat proportionality, and species identifications can vary; rigorous on-site validation and specimen confirmation are essential for robust results.
- Safety and logistics
  - Field conditions, accessibility, and safety procedures influence sampling design and data completeness.
