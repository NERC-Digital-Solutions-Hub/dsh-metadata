# HEADWATERS

- Purpose: Document the Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) headwater stream and pond condition survey protocols to produce GIS-ready, harmonised spatial data across GB. Emphasises standardized field methods, on-site data capture, and data quality procedures.

## Spatial design and scope

- Headwaters: Re-survey all 425 CS2000 squares for headwater streams.
  - Sampling elements per square: macroinvertebrate community, River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology, water chemistry, and physical characteristics.
  - 500 m sampling stretch per headwater site (defines RHS and sampling area).
- Ponds: In CS2007, randomly selected ponds within 629 CS2007 squares containing ponds are surveyed.
  - Elements: aquatic plant community, physical characteristics of the waterbody, water chemistry.
  - Pond mapping: mappers identify ponds and outer pond boundary; survey pond designated for detailed assessment.
- Data capture: Field data are designed for GIS use with precise locations, standardized forms, and on-site validation.

## Data capture and digital workflow

- Field data entry systems:
  - RHS data captured in RAPID (Tablet PC-based MS Access database).
  - Aquatic plant data captured in IRIS (Tablet PC-based MS Access database).
- On-site validation:
  - Both RAPID and IRIS include built-in data checks; progress must pass validation before leaving site.
- Location and identifiers:
  - NGR coordinates recorded to high precision; CS square, site, and surveyor identifiers captured for traceability.
- Data structure and standards:
  - Data are captured via dropdowns to minimize free-text errors; standardized fields align with RHS2003 and MTR/Macroinvertebrate methodologies.
- Photographs and relocation:
  - Photographs required for macroinvertebrate sampling area, RHS reach, and MTR plant survey; marker boards included in photos to aid relocation.

## Headwater field methods (macroinvertebrates, RHS, water chemistry)

- Macroinvertebrate sampling:
  - Target: single continuous sampling area (5–15 m) with proportional habitat sampling.
  - Method: standard 25 cm2 pond-net, 900 μm mesh; three-minute kick-sweep plus optional one-minute manual search.
  - Sample treatment: retain specimens for lab ID; exclude fish/amphibians; avoid sampling during/after spates.
  - Sample handling: fill containers with minimal water; fix with 40% formalin to ~4% formaldehyde; label pots; ensure avoidance of cross-contamination.
- Environmental data (within macroinvertebrate sampling area):
  - Record width, depth at 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 of stream width; estimate surface velocity; document substratum, bed stability, substrates (four size categories), channel habitats (pool, run, riffle, slack), bank top vegetation, and channel shading.
  - All measurements captured on the RIVPACS Sample Area Form; include a sketch map for relocation.
- Water chemistry (headwaters):
  - In-situ: conductivity and pH using a handheld meter.
  - Grab sample: filtered water for SRP, TON, and alkalinity (50 ml), collected in clean bottles, filtered on-site with 0.45 μm filters; samples prepared for lab analysis and posted to CEH Lancaster.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS) data capture:
  - 500 m RHS span centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site; site data entered via RAPID.
  - Spot-checks and overall substrate/habitat attributes recorded; data validation occurs on-site.

## River Habitat Survey (RHS) data workflow and quality

- RHS data model (2003 RHS protocol):
  - 500 m reach with 10 spot-checks, plus vegetation/substrate summaries.
  - On-site data capture and validation using RAPID; the RHS manual is accessible within the RAPID interface.
- Data integrity:
  - On completion, data are validated; any missing fields or inconsistencies are flagged and corrected before submission.
- Relocation and sharing:
  - RHS field data entered in RAPID; data can be exported to central systems; alignment with 2003 RHS indices ensures comparability with earlier CS2000/CS2007 data.

## Pond condition survey (macrophytes, chemistry, environment)

- Pond identification and mapping:
  - Ponds are defined as standing water bodies from 25 m2 to 2 ha, typically holding water for at least four months.
  - Mapping performed by mappers; one pond per square selected as the “survey pond.”
- Survey workflow:
  - Take a photo of the pond with square number.
  - Identify outer boundary; sketch outline and estimate pond area; measure drawdown height; estimate proportion of pond area with water.
  - Environmental and macrophyte surveys conducted in tandem.
  - Record inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, and surrounding land use; assess amenity value (view, public access, use).
- Macrophyte survey:
  - 100 m reach; walk/wade to record submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species; rough abundance estimates per species.
  - Species identification to the extent possible in field; specimens sent to labs for confirmation as needed.
  - Rare species flagged for specialist confirmation with guidelines for sampling and preservation.
- Macrophyte data handling:
  - IRIS/MACROPHYTE workflow includes 3 forms: species lists with abundance, physical site data, and specimen handling notes.
  - Detailed field sheets capture species, abundance, and percentage cover across submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent categories.
- Water quality and chemistry in ponds (if water present):
  - Conductivity and pH measured in situ; SRP/TON/alkalinity from a filtered 50 ml sample.
  - Turbidity estimated visually; sampling procedures for filters and labeling followed for CEH submission.
- Pond environmental data:
  - Document land use around ponds, bank features, vegetation, inflows/outflows, pollution, and grazing/waterbird presence.
- Documentation and sample transport:
  - Transport to CEH Dorset with Transport Emergency Card (TREM) guidance; monthly courier schedule; ensure proper labeling and packaging of samples.

## Data quality, governance and training

- Training and certification:
  - All headwater surveyors hold Environment Agency RHS certificates; trained in RIVPACS macroinvertebrate protocols and MTR aquatic plant methods.
- Team practices:
  - Regular swapping of field teams to maintain consistency in technique.
- Audits and QA:
  - Approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; data checked for consistency and quality.
- Field-sheets and checklists:
  - Field survey checklists ensure all tasks are completed; robust labeling and courier instructions for sample transport.

## Outputs and GIS relevance

- Spatially explicit datasets:
  - Macroinvertebrate communities (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (RHS), and water chemistry data linked to precise square-level locations.
  - Pond condition datasets (macrophyte communities, pond morphology, land use around ponds) with detailed attribute tables.
- Data integration:
  - Standardized data capture enables integration into national GIS-based analyses of freshwater habitat condition, biodiversity indicators, and hydromorphological diversity.
- Reproducibility and relocation:
  - Detailed relocation aids (sketch maps, photographs, fixed reference points) ensure repeatable site revisits, essential for longitudinal GIS analyses.
