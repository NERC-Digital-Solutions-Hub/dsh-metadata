# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
  - The policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

- Current CS partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
  - Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England (NE)
  - Welsh Government (WG)
  - Scottish Government (SG)
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
  - Forestry Commission (FC)
  - Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
  - Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

- Confidentiality rationale
  - Square locations are confidential to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for maintaining scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
  - Requests managed by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Circumstances and levels of release
  - Approximate locations: four-digit grid references can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing each square.
  - Precise locations: six-digit grid references allowed only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing locations; otherwise, external release requires exceptional demonstration that related IP confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
  - Spatial data within squares could indirectly reveal square locations and is governed by the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- License terms and usage restrictions
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed and a deletion confirmation provided at licence end.
  - Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; not used to visit CS squares or check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality level required for six-digit releases; explicit prohibition on attempting to deduce square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences with appropriate clauses.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences, signed by authorised representatives.
  - If approved, CEH supports licence administration; if denied, follows FOI/EIR procedures.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications and decisions.
  - CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by the policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid as negotiated.

- Implications for monitoring framework authors
  - Balances openness and data sharing with confidentiality and landowner protections.
  - Highlights the need for controlled data licensing, pre-processing capabilities, and clear governance to enable policy-relevant analysis while safeguarding sampling integrity.
