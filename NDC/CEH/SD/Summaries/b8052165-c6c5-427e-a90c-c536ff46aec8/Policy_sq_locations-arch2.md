# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: Maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity; policy specifically covers survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for the survey’s scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality is in the public interest; requests are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

Circumstances for release and precision level
- Approximate location value: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
- Precise location needs: six-digit grid references can be provided only after CEH-preprocessing analysis to avoid direct release of locations; in very exceptional cases, external release under licence may be approved if the applicant demonstrates that their own data/IP carries equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) can indirectly reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.
- Four-digit releases have lower IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.

Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need; licences are finite and for specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the licensing period.
- No data or outputs may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; location data cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP if requested.
- Four-digit releases have licensing terms similar to six-digit releases but do not require the same high level of IP confidentiality; license terms for spatial data and four-digit references include a clause prohibiting attempts to deduce precise square locations.

Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate confidentiality clauses; approvals are signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report summarising access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal CS partnership use with pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partner organisations are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, with case-by-case negotiation.
