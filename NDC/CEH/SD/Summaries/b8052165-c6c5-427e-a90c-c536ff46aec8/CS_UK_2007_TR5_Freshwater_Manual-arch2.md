# HEADWATERS

- aim and purpose
  - Use data to demonstrate environmental condition in a consistent, time-series format for scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance.
  - Build datasets to support monitoring responsibilities with topic expertise and standardized analytical approaches.

- who this applies to
  - Professionals in organisations with fixed freshwater monitoring duties.
  - Analysts with subject-matter expertise who follow broad, standardised methods rather than diving deeply into bespoke analyses every time.

- what they do (methods and outputs)
  - Data understanding and preparation
    - Identify required data from established sources, verify, quality assure, clean, and transform.
  - Standardised analysis
    - Apply standard methods to categorize environmental health against standards and produce outputs (e.g., reports, maps, charts).
  - Data management
    - Ensure created datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.
  - Outputs
    - Reports, maps, charts that communicate environmental health and policy performance over time.

    - data entered into IRIS (plants data) with validation and specimen handling guidance
  - plant identification and specimen handling
    - identify to species where possible; representative samples taken or photographed for rare/uncertain cases
    - guidelines for problematic taxa (e.g., Ranunculus, Callitriche, Potamogeton)
  - data integration and relocation
    - RHS data linked to macroinvertebrate sites; MTR data linked to corresponding macroinvertebrate sampling area
    - plant data linked to square/pond identifiers

- pond condition survey (CS2007)
  - overview and scope
    - identify all ponds in square; map and record basic attributes
    - select one “survey pond” per square with ponds for detailed conditioning survey (macrophytes, environmental features, water chemistry)
  - field tasks and measurements
    - photograph pond with square number
    - delineate outer boundary; sketch and size estimate
    - turbidity estimation prior to disturbance; water chemistry and meter readings if water present
    - environmental survey (amenity use)
    - macrophyte survey (walk/wade 100 m, record submerged, emergent, floating vegetation; specimen collection for ID)

    - record all wetland plant species within pond boundary
    - abundance estimates (dominant, abundant, frequent, occasional, rare)
    - categorize total cover by submerged, floating-leaved, emergent and overhang
    - plant identification guidance and rare species confirmation procedures

  - emphasis on accreditation, field training, and using standard taxonomic references for identification

- challenges and opportunities for Analysts
  - challenge: increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant environmental data
  - challenge: enabling broader access to underlying data behind final outputs
  - opportunity: data standardisation across headwater and pond assessments enables cross-site and long-term monitoring analyses

- notes for analysts
  - the document provides a comprehensive framework for data collection, validation, and integration across macroinvertebrate, hydromorphological, aquatic plant, and pond condition domains
  - the standardized tools (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR, RAPID, IRIS) support robust, comparable environmental health assessments over time and space
