# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise the public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Confidentiality rationale

- Locations are confidential to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Secrecy preserves scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public-interest stance; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels

- Allowed releases:
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) under licence for approximate location context.
- More precise releases:
  - Six-digit grid references (within squares) are allowed only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances.
  - External requests must demonstrate that IP data (data/models) require equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
  - Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- Four-digit releases:
  - Use licensed terms similar to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality criteria.
  - Prohibited use to derive exact square locations or identify square locations; no planning of visits or landowner surveillance.

## Conditions of release

- Licensees must:
  - Preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Use licenses for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
  - Destroy data at the end of the licensing period and confirm destruction in writing.
  - Not release data to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
  - Not use location data to inform visits to CS squares or to check compliance of landowners.
  - Provide evidence of project management standards equivalent to JCOP if requested.
- Four-digit releases are governed by similar terms, with less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
- Users must not attempt to derive precise square locations or claim to have done so.

## Responsibilities and process

- Decision-making and licensing:
  - CEH acts on behalf of NERC to make exceptional release decisions.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licenses containing the policy terms; licenses must be signed by a senior authority from the licensee organisation.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- Oversight and reporting:
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Practical support and consultation:
  - CEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis support within a reasonable timeframe for CS partners; case-by-case for other organisations.
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Implications for data governance and stewardship

- Establishes controlled access for sensitive location data, with formal licensing, duration limits, and destruction requirements.
- Enables data sharing in a way that protects sampling integrity and landowner relations while supporting policy-relevant uses.
- Requires clear roles, auditability, and coordination among CS partners, CEH, and licensees to manage requests, approvals, and risk.
