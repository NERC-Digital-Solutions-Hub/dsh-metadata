# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Overview
  - Aim: maximise the utility of CS spatial data for public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners: CEH (Natural Environment Research Council), Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Preserve scientific integrity of sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
  - Public-interest rationale; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Release circumstances and precision levels
  - Data access can identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
  - Six-digit grid references: only in very exceptional circumstances; require demonstration that linked IP data requires equal/higher confidentiality; CEH may process instead of external release.
  - Spatial data within squares (habitats, linear features) carry similar confidentiality and may be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- Licence conditions
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite in duration; data must not be retained beyond project; must be destroyed at end of period.
  - No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise confidentiality; consult CEH if unsure.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same IP confidentiality level; must not enable precise square identification.

- Responsibilities and process
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; signed by authorized senior representatives.
  - Denials follow UK Act and Regulations procedures.
  - CEH provides an annual report on access applications and decision grounds.
  - For internal CS use, CEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; external requests handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before using CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
