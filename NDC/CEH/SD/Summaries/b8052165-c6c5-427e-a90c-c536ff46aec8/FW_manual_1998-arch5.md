# Contract Report (non-refereed)
Countryside Survey 2000. Module 2: survey of freshwater habitats. Field handbook v.2.0.

## Executive overview
- Describes CS2000 field methodology for freshwater habitats, including sampling of macroinvertebrates, River Habitat Survey (RHS), diatoms, chironomid pupal exuviae, and water chemistry.
- Covers planning, permissions, field procedures, equipment, safety, data collection, documentation, quality control, and SERCON integration.
- Supports time-series continuity with CS1990 and enables broader policy-relevant analyses and reporting.

## Data standards, metadata, and provenance
- Standardized field protocols to ensure data comparability across sites and years (CS1990 → CS2000).
- Core data streams include:
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS-compatible) with defined sampling area, timing, and labeling.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS) covering 500 m reaches with 10 spot-checks and a sweep-up; includes physical, vegetation, land-use, and channel features.
  - Diatom, chironomid pupal exuviae, and single chemical samples per site; fixed sampling proximity to macroinvertebrate site.
- Defined data codes and forms:
  - Site identifiers (M for macroinvertebrate site; MR for reserve macros; D for diatoms; C for pupal exuviae).
  - Spot-check abbreviations, substrate categories (Wentworth-scale), flow types, and bank/top features.
  - Multiple data fields per form (dates, grid references, land class/square numbers, sampler names, replicate indicators, etc).
- Documentation includes maps, landowner details, ownership, access status, and sampling plans to support data lineage and reproducibility.

## Data quality assurance and governance
- Quality control:
  - 10% of flowing-water sites undergo replicate sampling across invertebrates, environmental data, diatoms, and pupal exuviae.
  - Regular team rotations and auditor-style checks of RHS data; training and accreditation required for RHS surveyors.
  - Emphasis on complete, legible forms; thorough labeling and consistent measurement practices (e.g., width, depth, velocity, substratum, and channel features).
- Replication and comparability:
  - Replicate sampling constructed to assess inter- and intra-operator variability; replicate data flagged as first/replicate samples.
- Equipment and handling:
  - Standardized field equipment lists (nets, bottles, fixatives, storage trays) with strict labeling, sealing, and transport procedures.
  - Formalin fixation and COSHH considerations highlighted; safety measures and emergency procedures outlined.
- Data management implications:
  - Field data feed into lab analyses (RIVPACS, chemical analyses) with traceable sample IDs and storage in controlled containers/trays.
  - Clear guidance on data capture cadence and field-to-lab data flow to preserve data integrity.

## Permissions, governance, and safety
- Permissions:
  - Prior landowner permissions sought; letters sent in advance; on-site confirmation of access when surveying.
  - If access to parts of a square is denied, RHS may be abandoned or adapt survey scope; replacement squares drawn as needed.
- Safety and COSHH:
  - Health and safety guidance, lone-worker provisions, and required PPE (gloves, barrier cream, life jackets, protective clothing).
  - Training requirements, emergency procedures, and contact protocols with River Laboratory/Project Leaders.
  - Formaldehyde handling and transport requirements, including labeling, packaging, and spill/first-aid procedures.
- Field ethics and conduct:
  - Courteous engagement with landowners; priority on safety; documentation of access issues and problems.

## Data models and interoperability
- Primary data models:
  - Macroinvertebrate data (RIVPACS-compatible) with environmental context; 50 m RHS reach and 500 m RHS section linkage.
  - RHS data capturing broad habitat units, banktop land-use, vegetation structure, and channel features.
  - Diatom, pupal exuviae, and water-chemistry data linked to corresponding macroinvertebrate sampling site.
  - SERCON integration to assess river conservation value, with pathways for additional SERCON components where required.
- Standardization across years and modules:
  - Re-survey of CS1990 squares (508) plus additions (30 new squares) to maintain timeseries and country-level estimates.
  - Harmonized field procedures and data fields to enable robust cross-year analyses and policy-relevant reporting.

## Data lifecycle, storage, and documentation
- Field collection and transport:
  - Samples fixed promptly in formalin; labeling and containerization standardized; storage in secure trays/boxes; transport with appropriate safety measures.
- Archiving and discovery:
  - Data and field forms designed for integration with lab results and long-term archives; aim for discoverability via established data portals (NORA/CEH context) and alignment with NERC data-sharing practices.
- Documentation and traceability:
  - Detailed field forms with metadata (square, land class, sampling date, sampler, replicate status) to enable traceability and reproducibility of results.

## Practical recommendations for Data Stewards
- Enforce complete, machine-readable metadata for each dataset (site, square, date, sampler, sampling method, replicate status, and form version).
- Maintain a data dictionary and codebook for all field codes (M/MR/D/C, spot-check abbreviations, substrate classes, flow types, channel features, etc).
- Ensure rigorous data quality checks, including replication protocols, audits, and inter-operator calibration activities.
- Document data lineage, including sampling framework changes, mapping/coordinates, and any site-specific deviations or adaptations.
- Align data governance with NERC/NORA policies; clearly delineate data access rights, licensing, and citation requirements.
- Provide clear data versioning and update workflows to support ongoing time-series analyses and policy-relevant reports.

## Endnotes
- The handbook integrates methodologies for RHS, macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS), diatom and chironomid sampling, and chemical analyses, all within a standardized governance framework designed for large-scale, time-series ecological data.
