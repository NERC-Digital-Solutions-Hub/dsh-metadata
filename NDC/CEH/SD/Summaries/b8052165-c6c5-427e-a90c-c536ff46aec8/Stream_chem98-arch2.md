# Headwater stream water chemistry data 1998 [Countryside Survey] Data Table Descriptions

- Overview
  - Describes the STREAM_CHEMISTRY_98.csv data table for the Countryside Survey (1998).
  - Contains freshwater headwater stream water chemistry data collected in 1998.
  - Measurements include field conductivity and pH; lab analyses include soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and alkalinity from 50 ml filtered samples.
  - Data are part of the Countryside Survey dataset owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.

- Data table contents
  - Yearly and spatial identifiers:
    - YEAR: Year of survey (text)
    - SQUARE: 1 km square sampling site code (text)
    - SITE_ID: Site identifier within the 1 km square (numeric)
    - SAMPLE_DATE: Date sample taken (date)
    - SAMPLE_TYPE: Type of sample (text)
  - Chemical determinands:
    - DETERMINAND_NAME: Chemical determinand (text)
    - DETERMINAND_UNITS: Units of the determinand (text)
    - VALUE: Measured value (numeric)
  - Geographical and classification metadata:
    - LC07: Land class 2007 (text)

- Variables and fields
  - Primary data are numerical chemical values associated with each site and sampling event.
  - Includes both field measurements (conductivity, pH) and laboratory-processed measurements (SRP, alkalinity).
  - Each row correlates a determinand to its measured value at a given site/date.
