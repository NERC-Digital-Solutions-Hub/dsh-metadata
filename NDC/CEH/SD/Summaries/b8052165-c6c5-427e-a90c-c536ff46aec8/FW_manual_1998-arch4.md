# Module 2: Survey of freshwater habitats

- Overview
  - Field handbook for Countryside Survey CS2000 freshwater module; collects multiple data streams (macro-invertebrates, River Habitat Survey RHS, diatoms, chironomid pupal exuviae, and ecofact macrophytes) across 435 1km squares.
  - Data designed for compatibility with national systems (RIVPACS, SERCON) and to inform policy, habitat assessment, and conservation planning.

- Data collected and data types
  - Macro-invertebrates (RIVPACS-compatible)
    - Sampling: three-minute main pond-net collection plus one-minute manual search; 50m River Habitat Survey (RHS) reach; 10% replicate samples for quality control.
    - Environmental data captured for the entire sampling area (width, depth, substratum, velocity) and habitat cover.
    - Output includes taxa presence and abundance categories; detailed labeling and chain-of-custody for samples fixed in preservative.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - 500m reach centered on macro-invertebrate site; 10 spot-checks at ~50m intervals; record banktop land-use, vegetation structure, channel substrata, flow types, and channel features.
    - Additional SERCON component for conservation assessment; accreditation required for surveyors; data captured on RHS forms with standardized abbreviations.
  - Diatoms and chironomid pupal exuviae
    - Diatoms sampled near macro-invertebrate site (within 25m); five replicate gravel sampling if needed.
    - Pupal exuviae collected for CPET-style water quality assessment; fixed with preservative; labeled with site identifiers.
  - Water chemistry
    - On-site chemical sampling for pH, conductivity, alkalinity, phosphate, trace metals, major cations; on-site filtration; strict labeling and handling procedures.

- Data standards, interoperability, and metadata
  - Emphasis on standardization across observers; use of field forms (RHS Part Three) and appendices to ensure comparability with RIVPACS and SERCON outputs.
  - Field labeling conventions: square number format (land class/square number), date, sampler names, and replicate identifiers; separate external labels for samples; maintain traceable sample lineage through transport and storage.
  - Geospatial context: use of 1:10,000 and 1:50,000 OS maps; mid-site grid references; GPS as a supplement to site location.
  - Methodology guidance includes explicit sampling routines, environmental data recording forms, and predefined abbreviations to promote data consistency.

- Data governance, quality assurance and control
  - Training and accreditation: RHS surveyors must be accredited; ongoing training and periodic re-accreditation; field teams regularly rotated to minimize method drift.
  - Quality checks: 10% of flowing-water sites replicated; approximately 7% of RHS surveys audited by experienced staff; emphasis on inter- and intra-operator variability assessment.
  - Documentation discipline: meticulous labeling, complete field forms, and end-of-site quality control checks to avoid resurvey needs.

- Data management lifecycle and storage
  - Field collection to lab processing flow with fixed samples (formalin) and robust labeling; samples stored in designated grey stacking trays; controlled transport to River Laboratory.
  - Sample containers, fixatives, and preservatives standardized; fixative handling includes safety and COSHH considerations.
  - Data documentation includes site name, river name, sampling date, NGR, land class, and component-specific codes; photos captured for re-location and site character.

- Data usability, users, and strategic value
  - Data feed national-level assessments (RHS, SERCON, and RIVPACS) to evaluate river habitat quality, conservation status, and landscape-scale changes.
  - Timeseries design (CS1990 vs CS2000) supports trend analysis and policy-making (e.g., land-use policy, ecological assessments).
  - Integration with broader data workflows, including satellite-derived land cover, to connect ground-truthing with top-down data.

- Challenges and risk considerations
  - Ensuring data consistency across many observers and years; field safety and permissions complicate access to some squares; reliance on landowner cooperation for access.
  - Data gaps may arise from non-flowing sections, dry sampling points, or issues with sample preservation and transport.
  - Handling of hazardous materials (formalin) and field safety protocols (PPE, lone-worker considerations) are integral to data integrity and researcher safety.

- Recommendations for Data Leaders
  - Prioritize rigorous standardization and certification of field personnel; maintain robust metadata and data lineage for all sampling components.
  - Invest in interoperable data schemas that align RHS, SERCON, and RIVPACS outputs; ensure machine-readable data and clear mappings between field forms and data products.
  - Strengthen data governance around access, sharing, and archiving; implement regular quality assurance cycles, including replicate sampling and external audits.
  - Enhance discoverability and reuse by linking field data to GIS layers, historical time series, and national conservation indices; enable downstream integration with partner networks and policy teams.
  - Ensure safety and COSHH compliance are embedded in data workflows, with clear procedures for hazardous materials, incident reporting, and training.

- Key takeaways for data strategy
  - The CS2000 freshwater module generates multi-disciplinary, standardized, and policy-relevant data streams (biological, physical habitat, and chemical) designed for interoperability with national conservation frameworks.
  - Data quality is reinforced through accreditation, replication, and rigorous labeling/metadata practices, enabling reliable trend analyses and governance decisions.
  - The data architecture supports long-term data discoverability, cross-system compatibility, and integration with partner networks for broader ecological understanding and management.
