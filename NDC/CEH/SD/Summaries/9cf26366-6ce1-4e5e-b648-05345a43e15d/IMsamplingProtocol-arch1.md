# IM Protocol

- The protocol describes collecting and identifying daily macrolepidoptera (large moths) using a standard light trap, leveraging the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) network to build a long-term national database and analyze trends in populations as indicators of environmental change.
- Background references and prior RIS work (e.g., Taylor 1986; Woiwod et al.) provide the rationale and context for this methodology.

## Rationale
- Butterflies and moths are good indicators of environmental change due to their ecological traits.
- A long-running, standardized light-trap protocol supports robust trend analysis and data comparability across sites.

## Equipment
- Standard Rothamsted light trap (Williams 1948) requiring a continuous power supply.
- Light source: 200 watt, clear tungsten lamp; safety wired with an RCD.
- Collection uses a jar lined with plaster and containing ~5 ml tetrachloroethane to immobilize insects quickly.

## Location
- Trap placed to be convenient for daily emptying; near the TSS when possible, often near laboratories, houses, or farms.
- Shelter from vegetation; ideally >20 m from artificial light sources to avoid interference.

## Sampling
- Ideal: daily empties throughout the year; if not possible, samples can be accumulated (e.g., weekends).
- Specimens are posted to Rothamsted for identification unless local expertise is available.
- Data are stored in the RIS database and the ECN database; multiple traps may be used at large sites if feasible.
- Time requirement: emptying about 40 minutes per trap per week plus travel; identification time up to 15 days per site per year for very experienced identifiers.

## Appendix I: The Rothamsted Insect Survey light trap - description and daily operation
- Trap structure: stand ~1.2 m tall with a 0.6 x 0.6 m footprint; overall height ~1.5 m.
- Light: mains-powered 200 W tungsten lamp; use of a solar dial time-switch that adjusts for daylength.
- Sample collection: collecting jar dosed with tetrachloroethane; samples transferred to tissue-lined pill boxes in a ventilated area; jars re-dosed for the next night.
- Labeling: boxes marked with site name and the correct date range; if multiple boxes, indicate 1/2 for each.
- Operational notes: report any dates when the trap did not operate (lamp failure, etc.).

## Safety
- Tetrachloroethane hazards: toxic by inhalation, skin, and eye contact; requires good ventilation and PPE; proper handling and spill procedures.
- Electricity safety: disconnect power before changing bulbs; avoid exposed circuits; regular RCD testing.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Data must include four core identifiers for each sampling event:
  - Site Identification Code
  - Core Measurement Code
  - Location Code
  - Sampling Date/Time
- Data are formatted according to ECNCCU specifications and RIS data transfer documentation.
- Core measurement: invertebrates - moths (IM Protocol) includes fields such as:
  - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Date trap set, Sampling date
  - Species code, Species name, Number caught (units defined by RIS code)
  - Optional second line for genus/species count and related metadata
- Recording forms follow the Heslop (1964) coding system used by RIS.

## Recording forms and data transfer
- Operators should refer to Rothamsted Insect Survey data transfer documentation for the ECN dataset formats and metadata requirements.

## Notes
- Sampling Date is the date the catch is collected following overnight recording; any non-operational nights must be reported with the corresponding dates.
- The Heslop (1964) numbering system is the coding standard used for taxonomy and data entries.
