# IM Protocol

- Aim
  - Collect and identify daily collections of macrolepidoptera (butterflies and moths) using a standard light trap.
  - Use this group as indicators of environmental change and to analyze long-term population trends, leveraging the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) database and related national datasets.

- Rationale
  - Butterflies and moths are well known taxonomically and biologically; their larval feeding habits make them good indicators of environmental change.
  - The protocol builds on the RIS light-trap network and extensive historic data, enabling robust trend analyses.
  - It draws on established background literature and RIS methodology to ensure consistent monitoring.

- Equipment
  - Standard Rothamsted light trap (Williams 1948) requiring a continuous power supply.
  - 200 watt clear tungsten lamp; trip switch or RCD for safety.

- Location
  - Trap sited for convenient daily emptying and near the target sampling area; proximity to laboratories, houses, or farms is common.
  - Preferably sheltered by vegetation; place more than 20 m from artificial light sources when possible.

- Sampling
  - Ideally daily trapping year-round; if not possible, accumulate samples (e.g., weekends).
  - Samples posted to Rothamsted for identification unless local expertise is available.
  - Data stored in RIS database and in the ECN database; larger sites may run multiple traps if operators permit.
  - Time investment: approximately 40 minutes per trap per week for emptying; up to 15 days per site per year for identification by an experienced identifier.

- Procedure (Appendix I)
  - Routine setup and daily operation of the RIS light trap, including checking the RCD, correct time/date, lamp functionality, and safe collection of samples.
  - Collect samples in a jar dosed with approximately 5 ml of tetrachloroethane; transfer insects to tissue-lined boxes in a safe area; re-dose the jar for the next night.
  - Label samples with site name and precise date ranges; follow conventions for multi-night sampling (e.g., 14–15 June 1995; or 27/30 January 1995 for a weekend sampling and Monday collection).
  - If multiple boxes are used, mark with appropriate date and “1/2” or “2/2”.

- Safety
  - Tetrachloroethane: effective for rapid insect immobilization but toxic; precautions include avoiding inhalation and skin contact, working in well-ventilated areas, and proper spill handling.
  - Electricity: ensure power is disconnected before bulb replacement; avoid exposed circuitry; regularly test the RCD.

- Specification of results and recording conventions
  - Data collected at ECN sites follow a defined schema; core fields identify the sample in space/time:
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC) for the measurement
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date/Time (with time element for non-daily sampling)
  - Core measurement: invertebrates – moths (IM Protocol)
  - Data fields (example): Species code, Species name, Number caught (unit RIS code) and possibly multiple entries per site/date
  - Recording forms align with RIS data capture and ECN data transfer documentation; Heslop (1964) numbering system is used for coding.

- Notes
  - Sampling Date reflects the date the catch is collected after overnight recording; nights with lamp failure or non-operation should still be reported with the appropriate date.
  - Follow Heslop (1964) coding conventions for data entry and labelling.
