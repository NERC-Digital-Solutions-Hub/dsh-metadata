# IM Protocol

## Aim
- Collect and identify daily collections of macrolepidoptera (large moths) using a standard light trap.
- Leverages the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) framework and its extensive 25-year national database to support long-term analyses of population trends.
- Serves as a standardized protocol with an established data infrastructure to enable consistent data capture, storage, and subsequent analysis.

## Rationale
- Butterflies and moths are well-known taxonomically/biologically and are good indicators of environmental change.
- The protocol builds on RIS expertise and archives, ensuring continuity and comparability of data over time.
- Provides a robust background for data governance and traceability through documented methods and references.

## Method
- Sampling via a standard RIS light trap (Williams 1948) with a 200 W tungsten lamp, powered by mains electricity.
- Trap operation and daily handling are guided by a detailed Appendix I procedure.
- Data recording aligns with RIS/ECN standards to enable consistent downstream analysis.

## Time
- Sampling schedule aims for daily trap emptying throughout the year; if not possible, accumulation over weekends or other periods is acceptable.
- Daily trap-collected samples require ~40 minutes per trap per week for emptying, plus travel.
- Identification may take up to 15 days per site per year for highly experienced staff.

## Author References
- Core literature and prior work establishing methodology and long-term context (e.g., Woiwod, Taylor, Williams, Harrington, Heslop).

## Equipment
- Standard Rothamsted light trap with a 200 W clear tungsten lamp.
- Safe power supply with RCD/trip switch; lamp replaced when needed.
- Collection jar dosed with ~5 ml tetrachloroethane for rapid insect immobilization and containment.

## Location
- Trap sites should be convenient for daily emptying and near research facilities or residences when possible.
- Prefer shelter from vegetation; place >20 m from artificial light sources when feasible.

## Sampling
- Daily emptying preferred; samples mailed to Rothamsted for identification unless local expertise is available.
- For large sites, multiple traps may be used if operators are available.
- Samples are stored in RIS and ECN databases; data submission guidance exists in restricted documentation.

## Procedure
- Step-by-step operational checks (power, clock, light, sample transfer, labeling, and re-dosing) to ensure consistent daily collection.
- Clear labeling conventions to indicate site, date, and whether samples span multiple nights.
- Documentation of any nights when the trap did not operate (e.g., lamp failure) to maintain data integrity.

## Appendix I. The Rothamsted Insect Survey light trap: description and daily operation procedure
- Detailed trap construction and setup (stand height, trap dimensions, light source, power safety).
- Daily routine for sample collection, labeling, and preparation for transport.
- Specific date convention to ensure accurate temporal metadata (trap set vs sampling date).

## Safety
- Tetrachloroethane is used for rapid killing/containment but is toxic; strict handling protocols are required.
- Safety measures include working in well-ventilated areas, PPE, proper spill procedures, and avoidance of inhalation or skin contact.
- Continual review of safer alternatives as available.

## Electricity
- The trap relies on mains electricity; ensure power is disconnected before lamp replacement.
- All electrical work should be conducted with caution and, if needed, by a qualified electrician.
- Regular testing of the RCD according to manufacturer recommendations.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Core dataset fields (key identifiers) required for every sampling location:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time (date and possible time element)
- Core measurements and observations:
  - Species code, species name, number caught
  - Units coded by RIS
- Data format notes:
  - Data stored in ECN and RIS databases; ECN data transfer formats defined in restricted Data Transfer documentation
  - Use Heslop (1964) numbering system for coding conventions

## Recording forms
- Refer to Rothamsted Insect Survey data forms and ECN data transfer documentation for consistent data capture and submission.

## Notes
- Sampling dates reflect the catch date after overnight recording; non-operating nights must be reported with the correct date range.
- The Heslop (1964) coding system governs the data coding approach used in the protocol.
