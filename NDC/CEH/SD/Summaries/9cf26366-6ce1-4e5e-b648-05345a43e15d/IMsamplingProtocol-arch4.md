# IM Protocol

## Aim
- Collect and identify daily collections of macrolepidoptera (large moths) using a standard light trap.
- Leverage Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) expertise and long-term national database (25+ years) to analyze trends in populations as indicators of environmental change.

## Rationale
- Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are well-known taxonomically and biologically and, due to phytophagous larvae, serve as good environmental change indicators.
- Protocol aligns with RIS methodology to ensure consistent data quality and long-term comparability.
- Background and context provided by RIS literature and key references.

## Equipment and Location
- Equipment: Standard RIS light trap powered by mains electricity (200 W tungsten lamp); needs continuous power; safety devices (RCD/trip switch).
- Location: Near the TSS when possible; near laboratories, houses, or farms if needed; sheltered by vegetation; away from artificial light sources by >20 m when feasible.
- Sampling capacity: Ideally one trap per site daily; more traps at large sites if capable operators are available.

## Sampling and Data Management
- Sampling frequency: Ideally daily throughout the year; if not possible, accumulate samples (e.g., weekends) and post for identification.
- Identification: Samples posted to Rothamsted for identification unless local experts are available.
- Data storage: All data stored in the RIS database and the ECN database; data formats align with ECNCCU data transfer documentation.
- Data collection workflow: 
  - Daily trap emptying ~40 minutes per trap per week plus travel.
  - Taxonomic identification by experienced staff; data entry follows standardized formats (RIS codes, species names, counts).
  - For large sites, consider multiple traps.
- Data standards and coding:
  - Use Heslop (1964) coding system for specimens.
  - Core fields include: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/time, species code, species name, and number caught (RIS code).
  - Data specify the trap set date and sampling date; report any nights when the trap did not operate.

## Procedure (Appendix I: Light Trap Description and Daily Operation)
- Trap structure: ~1.2 m stand, ~1.5 m total height, 0.6 m width/depth; 200 W clear tungsten lamp; automatic dawn/dusk switching; dosing jar lined with plaster.
- Collecting jar: 5 ml tetrachloroethane per jar to immobilize insects; handle jar with lid to avoid vapour exposure.
- Daily routine steps:
  1. Check RCD status; reset if tripped; replace fuse if needed.
  2. Verify GMT time on clock; do not adjust for local time changes.
  3. Confirm lamp operation; replace bulb if necessary.
  4. Collect sample into pre-dosed jar; cap jar with lid.
  5. In a ventilated area, transfer sample to tissue-lined pill boxes; re-dose jar for next use; label with site and date.
  6. If samples span multiple nights, date accordingly (e.g., 14–15 June 1995).
- Date conventions: If using multiple boxes, annotate with appropriate dates and fractions (e.g., 1/2).
- Non-operating nights: Report dates on which the trap did not operate (e.g., lamp failure).

## Safety and Hazards
- Tetrachloroethane risks: toxic by inhalation, skin, and eye contact; precautions include working outside or in a well-ventilated area, eye protection, and careful handling.
- Electric safety: Ensure power is disconnected before bulb changes; consult electricians for exposed circuitry; regular RCD testing per manufacturer guidelines.

## Data Specifications and Recording Conventions
- Required dataset fields (ECN Site/ECNCCU data transfer context):
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time (with time element if sampling more than daily)
- Core measurement: Invertebrates – moths (IM Protocol) with accompanying fields:
  - Species code, Species name, Number caught (units = RIS code)
- Data capture notes:
  - Sampling Date is the catch date after overnight recording; report nights when the trap did not operate.
  - Follow Heslop (1964) coding for species identifiers.
- Data access and documentation:
  - Data transfer documentation and ECN dataset formats are available via restricted access Site Managers’ extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
  - Appendices contain full trap description, operation procedure, and data coding references.
