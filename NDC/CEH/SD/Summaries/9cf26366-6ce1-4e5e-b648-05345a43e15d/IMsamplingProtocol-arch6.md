# IM Protocol

## Aim and Rationale
- Collect and identify daily collections of macrolepidoptera (large moths) using a standard light trap.
- Lepidoptera as an indicator group for environmental change; relies on Rothamsted Insect Survey methodology.
- Leverages a long-term national database accumulated over ~25 years; supports trends analysis and environmental monitoring.

## Equipment
- Standard Rothamsted light trap (Williams 1948) requiring continuous mains power.
- Light source: 200-watt, clear tungsten lamp; powered by mains electricity; safety features include a trip switch or Residual Current Device (RCD).

## Location
- Site near the TSS (target sampling site) and convenient for daily emptying.
- Often near laboratories, houses, or farms to facilitate access; remote sites possible if power is available.
- Shelter with vegetation; ideally >20 m from artificial light sources.

## Sampling
- Ideal: daily trap emptying year-round; if not possible, samples can be accumulated (e.g., weekends).
- Specimens posted to Rothamsted for identification unless local expertise is available.
- Data stored in Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) database and ECN database.
- For large sites, multiple traps are desirable if feasible.
- Operational timing: emptying trap ~40 minutes per trap per week, plus travel time.
- Identification time: up to 15 days per site/year for very experienced identifiers.

## Procedure
- Follow daily RIS operational steps (Appendix I) for maintenance and sample processing.
- Key steps include: verifying RCD function, ensuring correct time clock (GMT), confirming lamp operation, collecting samples with tetrachloroethane, transferring insects to pill boxes, re-dosing jars, and labelling with site and date.
- Dates reflect trap set vs. emptied periods; multi-night runs use appropriate date ranges and box numbering (e.g., 1/2).

## Appendix I: Light trap description and daily operation
- Trap stand: ~1.2 m height; overall ~1.5 m tall; trap ~0.6 m square.
- Light: 200 W clear tungsten lamp; automatic solar dial time-switch adjusts for daylength; lamp on at dusk, off at dawn.
- Collecting jar: contains ~5 ml tetrachloroethane; insects killed rapidly and stored in labeled jars.
- Daily routine: check RCD, clock, bulb; replace bulb if needed; transfer sample to tissue-lined pill boxes; re-dose jar with tetrachloroethane; label boxes with site and date; report any lamp failures.

## Safety
- Tetrachloroethane: toxic via inhalation/skin/eyes; work outside or in a fume area; use PPE; manage spills safely.
- Electricity: disconnect power before bulb changes; ensure restricted access to exposed circuits; regular RCD testing per manufacturer guidance.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Data collection at ECN Sites follows a standardized data transfer format (ECN dataset formats) with controlled access documentation.
- Four primary identifiers required for every sample:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC; sample core)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time (including time if sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Core measurement: invertebrates – moths (IM Protocol) with fields:
  - Species code, Species name, Number caught (units RIS code)
  - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Date trap set, Sampling date
- Data release and transfer follow Heslop (1964) coding conventions; see ECNCCU data transfer documentation for exact formats.

## Recording forms
- Refer to Rothamsted Insect Survey documentation for recording forms and data entry procedures.

## Notes
- Sampling Date refers to the date after overnight recording; nights when the trap did not operate should be reported.
- Coding system follows Heslop (1964) used by the Rothamsted Insect Survey.

## Data management and usage (Data Support perspective)
- The protocol provides standardized, long-term data suitable for cross-site analyses and trend detection.
- Data are consolidated in RIS and ECN databases, enabling cross-referencing and self-serve data exploration by end-users.
- Clear data specification (site, location, core measurement, timing, species, counts) facilitates data cleaning, integration with other datasets, and reproducible analyses.
- Documentation and transfer formats (ECN dataset formats; Heslop coding) support interoperability and reuse across projects and organisations.
