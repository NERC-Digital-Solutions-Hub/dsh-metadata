# Data availability and citation

- The Environmental Change Network (ECN) is the UK’s long-term environmental monitoring and research programme, measuring air, soil, water, and a range of animals and plants across a network of sites to track environmental change. The dataset uses the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework as a basis for defining ecosystem services and identifying variables or proxies.

## Ecosystem variables and MA framework

- MA (2001–2005) provides the theoretical framework and definitions for ecosystem services used to create variables for this dataset.
- Variables cover a broad range of ecosystem services, organized into categories such as Food, Fibre, Fuel, Genetic resources, Biochemicals and pharmaceuticals, Ornamental, Air quality regulation, Climate regulation, Water regulation, Erosion, Human diseases, Biological control, Pollination, Natural hazard, Other hazard, Cultural diversity, Spiritual and religious values, Educational values, Aesthetic values, Social relations, Heritage, and Ecotourism.
- The dataset uses a single-year snapshot (commonly 2009) or annual averages to reduce temporal variability, with area-dependent variables scaled by site area.

## Site selection and boundaries

- Eleven ECN sites were selected for the dataset, balancing biogeophysical features and social boundaries (e.g., land management and land ownership) to align with human decision-making scales.
- Land ownership and management delineate the primary boundaries for data collection; ECN site boundaries sometimes align with official boundaries at some sites, while others are embedded within larger management units.
- The sites and their total areas (ha) include ALI, CAI, DRA, GLE, MOO, NOR, POR, ROT, SNO, SOU, WYT, totaling 11,262 ha. Boundary characteristics include water basins, land management, land ownership, and ECN site boundary status; several sites include forests and/or water basins.

## Data sources and variable selection

- Data sources fall into three types:
  - (i) data collected for ECN according to standard ECN protocols
  - (ii) data provided by site managers from other sources
  - (iii) expert knowledge from site managers
- A site managers’ workshop (January 2010) standardized variable selection and definitions.
- Variables are defined comprehensively; each variable has a definition, units, and a variable number (1–63). Examples include:
  - Food: meat (tonnes ha-1), vegetables/fruit/mushrooms/eggs/cereals (yes/no), number of provisioning categories
  - Fibre: wool from sheep/goats, wood, etc. (tonnes ha-1)
  - Fuel: wood for fuel, hydro output
  - Genetic resources, Biochemicals and pharmaceuticals, Ornamental
  - Environmental regulation (air quality, climate, water), erosion, disease risk, pest regulation, pollination
  - Natural and other hazards, cultural diversity, spiritual/educational/aesthetic values
  - Social relations, heritage, ecotourism, and more
- Variables are standardized to the MA framework, with per-site data labeled by site codes (ALI, CAI, DRA, GLE, MOO, NOR, POR, ROT, SNO, SOU, WYT) in the dataset.

## Data format and dataset structure

- The dataset was originally created in Excel 2007 and was converted to a comma-separated values (CSV) file for long-term storage.
- Structure includes:
  - Service type (broad category of ecosystem service)
  - Variable (definition and units)
  - Variable_ID (short name)
  - Variable_Number (1–63)
  - Per-site columns: ALI, CAI, DRA, GLE, MOO, NOR, POR, ROT, SNO, SOU, WYT
- Table 3 maps per-site data to their respective site codes, enabling cross-site comparisons.
