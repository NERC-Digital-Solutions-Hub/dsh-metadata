# Data availability and citation

- The Environmental Change Network (ECN) dataset provides ecosystem services variables collected across 11 long-term monitoring sites in the UK, using the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework to define and assess goods and services.
- Purpose and scope: To enable consistent environmental and biodiversity measurements over time and space, supporting analysis of how the natural environment is changing and its ecosystem services.

## Site selection and boundaries

- Eleven ECN sites were selected with boundaries defined primarily by land ownership and land management, aligning with ECN site boundaries at several locations and encompassing whole farms or complete water basins where relevant.
- Boundary characteristics considered biogeophysical features and social discontinuities to reflect decision-making scales; site area totals 11,262 ha across all sites.
- Site codes include ALI, CAI, DRA, GLE, MOO, NOR, POR, ROT, SNO, SOU, WYT with per-site area and boundary attributes documented.

## Variables and data structure

- A comprehensive set of ecosystem service variables was created (Table 2 definitions), including:
  - Food, Fibre, Fuel, Genetic resources, Biochemicals and pharmaceuticals, Ornamental
  - Environmental regulation variables: Air quality regulation, Climate regulation, Water regulation, Erosion
  - Human-related and social values: Human diseases, Biological control, Pollination, Natural hazards, Cultural diversity, Spiritual and religious values, Educational values, Aesthetic values, Social relations, Heritage, Ecotourism
- Variables were standardized across sites via a site managers’ workshop (January 2010) to ensure consistency in definition and units.
- Data are area-adjusted: area-dependent variables are scaled by each site’s area; data for a single year (commonly 2009) or annual averages were used to minimize temporal variability.
- Variable naming and numerical identifiers are defined (Table 2; Table 3 explains column headers and site-specific data).

## Data sources and provenance

- Data sources are threefold:
  - (i) Data collected for ECN using standard ECN protocols
  - (ii) Data obtained by site managers from additional sources
  - (iii) Expert knowledge from site managers
- The dataset integrates data across these sources to provide a consistent, multi-site record of ecosystem service variables.

## Data format, storage, and access

- Original format: Excel 2007; long-term storage format: comma-separated values (CSV).
- Metadata and variable definitions are documented (Tables 2 and 3), including:
  - Service type, Indicator variable, Variable_ID, Variable_Number, and per-site data columns (ALI, CAI, DRA, GLE, MOO, NOR, POR, ROT, SNO, SOU, WYT).
- Data availability: Published as part of UK ECN data resources; associated with the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC). The dataset is linked to the publication:
  - Dick et al. (2011) Environmetrics paper: “A comparison of ecosystem services delivered by 11 long-term monitoring sites in the UK Environmental Change Network” (DOI: 10.1002/env.1069)
  - Original data reference: Ecosystem services variables from the UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) (DOI/URL: https://doi.org/10.5285/2c5f823d-0dca-4e66b021-de3e81131979)
- The dataset and its documentation (including variable definitions and site boundaries) are available via the ECN and the ECN data centre website.

## Governance, standards, and reuse

- Grounded in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) framework for ecosystem service definitions and categorization.
- Clear provenance through multiple sources (ECN protocols, site managers, experts) and a standardized variable selection process to enable cross-site comparability.
- Use cases include comparative analyses of long-term ecosystem services across sites (as demonstrated in the 2011 Environmetrics study), supporting reporting, policy, and governance needs for data stewardship, reuse, and ongoing updates.
