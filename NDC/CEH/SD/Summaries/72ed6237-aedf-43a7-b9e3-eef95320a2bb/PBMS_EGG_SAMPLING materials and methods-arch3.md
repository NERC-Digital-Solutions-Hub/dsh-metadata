# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) material and methods for egg samples

## Overview
- PBMS monitors contaminant concentrations in addled or deserted eggs to study embryotoxins and chemical impacts on predatory birds.
- For some rare species (e.g., golden eagle, Merlin) egg monitoring provides robust data when carcass-based sampling is impractical due to low population densities.
- Eggs from licensed collectors, who visit nests during other studies, are used to generate samples for analysis.

## Sampling and sample handling
- Licensed collectors gather eggs and record date, provenance, and measurements: length, breadth, and weight of each egg and its contents.
- Processing: eggs are cracked, contents homogenized, and then archived at -20°C in glass jars; eggshells are rinsed, dried for ~4 weeks, and weighed.
- Shell thickness index is calculated as: shell weight (mg) / (length (mm) × breadth (mm)).

## Core monitoring program
- Each year, one egg from each clutch of merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle is analyzed for contaminants (PCBs: 35 congeners, total PCBs, PCB-TEQs), organochlorine insecticides (OCs), and mercury.
- Approximately 10 gannet eggs from Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig are also analyzed for the same contaminants; gannet eggs are typically collected biennially from each colony.
- Results are published in annual reports, scientific papers, and on the PBMS website.

## Data sharing, feedback, and governance
- Results and summaries are publicly accessible via the PBMS website; annual reports also disseminate findings.
- Volunteer collectors receive biometric data for each submitted sample and a summary of contaminant levels for the analyzed subset, helping maintain engagement and data quality.
- The PBMS archive supports broader research beyond core monitoring, contributing to environmental toxicology studies and monitoring methodological development.

## Archive and long-term resource
- Frozen PBMS archive contains samples dating back to 1968: approximately 17,500 tissue samples and 9,000 egg contents.
- The archive enables retrospective analyses, evaluation of exposure to chemicals across time, and exploration of nonchemical threats (e.g., illegal trade/hunting) and genetic studies (e.g., structure of golden eagle populations).

## Relevance to monitoring framework authors
- Demonstrates practical design choices to monitor contaminants in rare or hard-to-sample species using surrogate materials (eggs).
- Emphasizes standardized data collection, sample processing, archiving, and open dissemination of results.
- Highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement (licensed collectors) and transparent data governance to support ongoing monitoring and future research.
- Shows how a long-term, well-archived sample bank enhances ability to pilot new monitoring approaches and address broader environmental questions.
