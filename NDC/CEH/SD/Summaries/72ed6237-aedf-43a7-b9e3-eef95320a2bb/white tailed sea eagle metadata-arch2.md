# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme

## Aim and scope
- Provides long-term temporal trend analyses of environmental contaminant data collected from predatory bird eggs.
- Produces standardized outputs (reports, maps, charts) to support environmental health oversight and policy performance assessment.
- Data and reports are accessible via the PBMS website for external scrutiny and reuse.

## Data content and structure
- Central dataset comprises per-egg records from nest sites, including:
  - Egg number (unique identifier; year-to-year numbering may vary)
  - Year of lay
  - Location (general nest site)
  - Shell Index (egg shell thickness indicator)
  - CF (concentration factor to convert to lipid-based concentrations)
- Contaminant measurements (egg contents on a wet weight basis; liver measurements on a dry weight basis) include:
  - Organochlorines: HCB, various HCH isomers (a-, g-), p,p-DDE, p,p-DDT, HEOD, p,p-TDE
  - Total PCB and TEQ (toxic equivalencies calculated from PCB congeners per 1997 WHO factors)
  - Extensive list of individual PCB congeners (e.g., PCB 8, PCB 18, PCB 28, PCB 52, PCB 77, PCB 101, PCB 105, PCB 114, PCB 118, PCB 123, PCB 126, PCB 153, PCB 170, PCB 183, PCB 187, PCB 194, PCB 199, PCB 201, PCB 205, PCB 206, PCB 209, and many others)
- Metals and metalloids measured (egg contents on a dry weight basis for most; some elements on a liver basis) include: Al, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Zn
- Data fields include indicators for Not Analysed (NA) and None Detected (ND)
- The dataset is accompanied by a column header description, units, and notes (e.g., eggshell thickness, analytical method references)

## Output formats and access
- Outputs are available as downloadable reports from the PBMS results page.
- Data handling processes include standardised verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation prior to publication or storage in portals.

## Data quality, standardisation and metadata
- Data are generated from established PBMS data sources with standardised methodologies for contaminant measurement.
- A comprehensive data dictionary outlines column headings, descriptions, units, and data status (NA/ND).
- The documentation notes historical changes in egg numbering systems and the dual reporting bases (egg contents vs. liver) with respective units.

## Key considerations for monitoring practice
- Provides a rich, multi-contaminant view of environmental health across time, enabling temporal trend analysis and policy evaluation.
- The breadth of analytes (organochlorines, PCBs, TEQ, metals) allows cross-comparison with other datasets and ecosystem indicators.

## Challenges and opportunities
- Challenge: Increasing the value of PBMS datasets by integrating with other relevant environmental data sources (e.g., habitat, climate, prey availability) rather than treating datasets as single-use.
- Challenge: Ensuring broad access to underlying data used to generate final outputs to enable replication and extended analyses.
- Opportunity: Enhance dataset interoperability and reuse by linking PBMS data with external environmental datasets, enabling more holistic assessments of ecosystem health and policy impact.
