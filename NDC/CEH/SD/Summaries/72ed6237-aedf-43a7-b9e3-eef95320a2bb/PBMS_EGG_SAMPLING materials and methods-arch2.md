# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) material and methods for egg samples

## Aim
- Monitor contaminant concentrations in addled or deserted eggs to assess environmental health and potential embryotoxic effects.
- Enable study of chemicals’ impacts on rarer predatory birds (e.g., golden eagle, Merlin) where carcass sampling is limited.
- Use eggs to derive robust data for species at low densities.

## Sampling and Collection
- Egg collection performed by licensed individuals as part of other studies (primarily ringing); only addled or deserted eggs are submitted.
- Collectors provide date, provenance, and egg measurements.
- On receipt, each egg is measured (length, breadth, weight) and contents are recorded.

## Processing and Archiving
- Eggs cracked; contents removed, degree of development assessed, contents homogenized and archived at -20°C in glass jars.
- Eggshell rinsed, dried for ~4 weeks at ambient temperature, then weighed.
- Eggshell thickness index calculated as shell weight (mg) divided by (length × breadth in mm).

## Core Monitoring and Analyses
- Each year, a subsample of archived eggs is analyzed for contaminants.
- One egg from each clutch of merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) analyzed for:
  - PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, PCB-TEQs)
  - Organochlorine (OC) insecticides
  - Mercury
- Approximately 10 gannet eggs from Bass Rock (North Sea) and Ailsa Craig (Irish Sea) analyzed for the same contaminants; gannet eggs are typically collected biennially per colony.

## Outputs and Dissemination
- Monitoring results published in annual PBMS reports and scientific papers.
- Findings, along with a dedicated PBMS webpage, disseminated to the public and scientific community.
- Volunteer collectors receive egg biometric data and a summary of contaminant levels from the analyzed samples, reinforcing engagement and data quality.

## Archive, Resources, and Access
- PBMS frozen archive dates back to 1968, comprising ~17,500 tissue samples and ~9,000 egg contents.
- Archive serves as a resource for environmental toxicology, broader conservation research, piloting new monitoring methods, and projects addressing nonchemical threats (e.g., illegal trading/hunting, genetic structure studies).

## Data Management and Compliance
- Data are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals as part of standardized monitoring outputs.
- Egg collection and handling operate under licensing and regulatory oversight to ensure ethical and legal compliance.
