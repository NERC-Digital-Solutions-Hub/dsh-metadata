# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) material and methods for egg samples

## Overview and purpose
- PBMS monitors contaminant concentrations in addled or deserted eggs to study embryotoxic risks and to assess impacts on rarer bird species (e.g., golden eagle, Merlin) where carcass-based sampling is limited.
- Egg-based monitoring enables robust contaminant assessment for low-density species and supports broader environmental toxicology research.

## Data collection and governance
- Licensed egg collectors operate under regulatory oversight; they visit nests as part of ringing studies and submit addled or deserted eggs to PBMS.
- Collected data elements recorded on receipt include: egg length, breadth, weight, contents weight, date of collection, and provenance.
- Data collection is aligned with monitoring objectives and ensures traceability from egg to analysis.

## Sample processing and metadata
- On receipt, contents are removed; approximate developmental stage is recorded; contents are homogenized and archived at -20°C in glass jars.
- Eggshells are rinsed, dried (4 weeks at ambient temperature), and weighed.
- Shell thickness index is calculated as: shell weight (mg) / (length (mm) × breadth (mm)).
- Processing creates standardized metadata for each egg to support comparable analyses over time.

## Core monitoring program and data types
- Each year, a subsample of archived eggs is analyzed for contaminants.
- Sampling scheme: one egg from each clutch of merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) submitted annually.
- Analytes: PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, and PCB-TEQs), organochlorine insecticides, and mercury.
- Gannet eggs (from Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig) are analyzed similarly (approximately 10 g), usually biennially per colony.
- Outputs include contaminant concentration data and are used to produce annual reports, scientific papers, and a dedicated PBMS webpage.

## Feedback, reporting, and user engagement
- Volunteer collectors receive biometric data for submitted eggs and a summary of analyzed contaminant levels.
- Providing regular feedback to collectors is essential for maintaining engagement and data submission quality.

## Data archive, preservation, and future use
- PBMS maintains a frozen archive dating back to 1968, comprising ~17,500 tissue samples and ~9,000 egg contents.
- The archive serves as a valuable resource for wide-ranging environmental toxicology studies and conservation research.
- It supports:
  -Assessment of chemical exposure and effects in predatory birds.
  - piloting and refinement of new monitoring approaches.
  - research on nonchemical threats, such as illegal trading and hunting impacts.
  - studies of genetic structure (e.g., golden eagle populations) and other long-term conservation objectives.
