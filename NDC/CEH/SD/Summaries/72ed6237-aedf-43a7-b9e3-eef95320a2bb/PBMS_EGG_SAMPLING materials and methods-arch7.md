# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) material and methods for egg samples

## Overview
- PBMS monitors contaminant concentrations in addled or deserted eggs to study chemical impacts on predatory birds.
- Sampling leverages eggs from rarer species (e.g., golden eagle, Merlin) due to low carcass availability for robust liver analyses.
- Licensed egg collection is required; PBMS uses eggs submitted by collectors affiliated with other studies (mainly ringing).

## Sampling and data collection
- Collected eggs: length, breadth, weight, contents weight; date of collection; provenance.
- Processing: eggs cracked, contents removed, approximate development stage assessed, contents homogenized and archived at -20°C in glass jars.
- Shell handling: shell rinsed and dried for ~4 weeks at ambient temperature, then weighed.
- Shell thickness index: shell weight (mg) divided by (length × breadth) (mm).

## Core and target sampling design
- Core program: one egg from each clutch of merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) annually; analyzed for PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, PCB-TEQs), organochlorine (OC) insecticides, and mercury.
- Gannet sampling: ~10 gannet eggs per colony (Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig) collected biennially; same contaminants analyzed.
- Rationale: focus on rare species where egg sampling yields sufficient data for contaminant monitoring.

## Laboratory analyses and outputs
- Contaminants measured: PCBs, OC insecticides, mercury.
- Data products: results published in annual PBMS reports, scientific papers, and on the PBMS website.
- Feedback to collectors: biometric data and summaries of analyzed samples provided to volunteers to maintain engagement and data quality.

## Archive, data management, and reuse
- Frozen archive: ~17,500 tissue samples and ~9,000 egg contents dating back to 1968.
- Uses: broad environmental toxicology studies, piloting and refining new monitoring, and researching non-chemical threats (e.g., illegal trade, hunting) and genetic structure (e.g., golden eagle populations).

## Accessibility and engagement
- Public-facing outputs: annual reports, scientific publications, PBMS website (http://pbms.ceh.ac.uk) with data summaries.
- Stakeholder engagement: ongoing feedback to volunteers to sustain the monitoring network.

## GIS and data implications
- Spatial data potential: mapping sampling sites, nests, and colonies; integrating provenance data with temporal sampling windows.
- Temporal analysis: long-running archive supports trend analyses for contaminant levels.
- Data integration: correlating contaminant data with environmental and ecological layers (e.g., colony locations, migration patterns).
- Data quality considerations: reliance on opportunistic sampling and limited numbers for some species; licensing and handling standards influence data completeness and comparability.
