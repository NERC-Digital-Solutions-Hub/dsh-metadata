# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) material and methods for egg samples

## Purpose and rationale
- Monitors contaminant concentrations in addled or deserted eggs to assess exposure to embryotoxins and monitoring residues.
- Enables study of chemicals’ impacts on rarer species (e.g., golden eagle, Merlin) where collecting carcasses is insufficient for robust data.
- Eggs from licensed collectors are used to supplement limited carcass data.

## Data collection and metadata
- Licensed collectors visit nests as part of other studies (primarily ringing) and submit addled/deserted eggs.
- For each egg: record length, breadth, weight, contents weight, date of collection, and provenance.
- Processing: crack eggs, remove contents, assess approximate development, homogenize contents, and archive at -20°C in glass jars.
- Shell handling: rinse shell, dry for 4 weeks at ambient temperature, then weigh.
- Shell thickness index = shell weight (mg) / (length (mm) × breadth (mm)).

## Core monitoring and analyses
- Each year, analyze contaminants in a subsample: one egg from each clutch of merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle.
- Analytes: PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, PCB-TEQs), organochlorine insecticides (OC), and mercury.
- Gannet eggs (≈10 per year from Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig) analyzed for the same contaminants; gannet data usually collected biennially.
- Results are published in annual reports, scientific papers, and on the PBMS website.

## Outputs, feedback, and engagement
- Outputs include summaries of contaminant levels and biometric data shared with volunteer collectors to maintain engagement.
- Feedback to collectors is essential for sustaining the volunteer network and data quality.

## Archive and research resources
- Frozen archive dates back to 1968, comprising ~17,500 tissue samples and 9,000 egg contents.
- Archive supports broader environmental toxicology studies and conservation research beyond core PBMS activities.
- Facilitates piloting and refining new monitoring methods and allows projects on nonchemical threats (e.g., illegal trade, hunting) and genetic structure studies of populations.

## Access, dissemination, and data use
- Core data and archive serve as resources for researchers and policy-relevant outputs.
- Public-facing dissemination occurs via annual reports, scientific publications, and the PBMS webpage.
