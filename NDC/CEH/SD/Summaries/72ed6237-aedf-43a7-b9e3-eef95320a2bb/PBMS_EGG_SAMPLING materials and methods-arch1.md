# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) material and methods for egg samples

- Purpose and scope
  - PBMS monitors contaminant concentrations in addled or deserted eggs to study embryotoxic chemicals.
  - Focus on rarer species (e.g., golden eagle and Merlin) where collecting enough carcasses is impractical; eggs provide an alternative sampling medium.
  - Collectors licensed by regulatory bodies visit nests and send addled/deserted eggs to PBMS.

- Sampling and data collection
  - For each egg: record length, breadth, weight, date of collection, and provenance.
  - On receipt: crack egg, remove contents, assess development, homogenize contents, and archive at -20°C in glass jars.
  - Shell handling: rinse shell, dry for 4 weeks at ambient temperature, then weigh.
  - Shell thickness index calculated as shell weight (mg) divided by (length × breadth) (mm).

- Core monitoring program and analyses
  - Each year, analyze a subsample of archived egg contents.
  - For one egg per clutch from merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla):
    - Analyze PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, and PCB-TEQs), organochlorine (OC) insecticides, and mercury.
  - Gannet eggs (~10 per colony) from Bass Rock (North Sea) and Ailsa Craig (Irish Sea) analyzed for the same contaminants; gannet eggs are usually collected biennially from each colony.
  - Results are published in annual reports, scientific papers, and on the PBMS website.
  - Volunteer collectors receive Egg biometric data and a summary of contaminant levels; feedback helps maintain engagement.

- Archive and long-term resource
  - Frozen PBMS archive dates back to 1968.
  - Contains approximately 17,500 tissue samples and 9,000 egg contents.
  - Serves as a valuable resource for environmental toxicology studies and conservation research; enables piloting and refinement of new monitoring approaches.
  - Supports projects addressing nonchemical threats (e.g., illegal trading, hunting) and studies on genetic structure of populations.

- Data usefulness and accessibility
  - Long-term datasets and structured sample metadata support time-series analyses, method development, and cross-study comparisons.
  - Data are disseminated publicly via annual reports, scientific publications, and the PBMS website, with ongoing linkage to collected samples and associated metadata.
