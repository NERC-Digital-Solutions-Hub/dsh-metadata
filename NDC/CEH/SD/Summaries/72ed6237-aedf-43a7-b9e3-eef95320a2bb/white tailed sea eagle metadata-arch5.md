# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme dataset

## Overview
- Dataset generated by the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS), designed for long-term temporal trend analyses of contaminant data in predatory bird eggs.
- Aims to support understanding of contaminant trends and to provide data for trend analyses through PBMS reports.
- Reports and results are downloadable from the PBMS website (http://pbms.ceh.ac.uk/results.htm).

## Data content and structure
- Primary focus: contaminant concentrations in eggs (homogenised egg contents) and related measurements in liver when applicable.
- Key variables and measurements include:
  - Egg identifiers: Egg number (unique per egg; numbering system may be numeric or alphanumeric due to changes over years).
  - Temporal and spatial context: Year (four-digit year of egg laying), Location (general Nest Site location).
  - Egg condition metric: Shell Index (thickness indicator as described by Ratcliffe, 1970).
  - Lipid normalization factor: CF (lipid-based concentration correction; values may be Not Applicable for some records).
  - Contaminants and data types:
    - Organochlorines and related compounds: HCB, a-HCH, g-HCH, p,p-DDE, HEOD, p,p-TDE, p,p-DDT.
    - Total PCB and specific PCB congeners (e.g., PCB 8, PCB 18, PCB 28, PCB 29, PCB 31, PCB 52, PCB 77, PCB 101, PCB 105, PCB 114, PCB 118, PCB 123, PCB 126, PCB 128, PCB 138, PCB 141, PCB 149, PCB 153, PCB 156, PCB 157, PCB 163, PCB 167, PCB 169, PCB 170, PCB 171, PCB 180, PCB 183, PCB 187, PCB 189, PCB 194, PCB 199, PCB 201, PCB 205, PCB 206, PCB 209, etc.).
    - Toxic Equivalents: TEQ (based on planar and coplanar PCBs and WHO TEFs for birds, 1997 values).
    - Individual element measurements: Al, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Zn (concentrations reported as total elements in homogenised egg contents; units often per g liver on a dry weight basis for some elements and per g egg content or wet weight for others).
  - Data quality indicators:
    - NA (Not Analysed) and ND (None Detected) used to denote missing or non-detected data.
    - Some fields marked as Not Applicable or Not Analysed depending on the sample and method.
- Data organization notes:
  - Column headers include a mix of descriptive fields and concentration values across many contaminants (potentially extensive congener lists).
  - The dataset includes metadata describing column meanings, units, and data classes (e.g., Description, Units, Classes).

## Data quality and provenance
- Data generated for long-term temporal analyses; values may be absent or not analysed for certain congeners or elements.
- Some measurements are reported on different bases (wet weight vs. dry weight; liver vs. egg contents) and may require harmonization for cross-record comparisons.
- Column-level definitions (e.g., units, interpretation of NA/ND) are provided to aid consistent interpretation and reuse.

## Access, usage, and governance
- PBMS reports containing results are publicly downloadable from the PBMS results page.
- For data stewardship, the dataset supports transparent provenance (PBMS as the data producer) and clear documentation of measurement methods, units, and calculation approaches (e.g., TEQ calculations per WHO TEFs).

## Practical considerations for Data Stewards
- Data harmonization:
  - Align units and reporting bases (wet vs. dry weight; liver vs. egg content) when aggregating or comparing records.
  - Normalize lipid-adjusted concentrations using CF where needed.
- Metadata and documentation:
  - Maintain comprehensive metadata on each contaminant, measurement method, lipid correction, and TEQ calculation references.
  - Capture the history of Egg number numbering changes and ensure lineage tracing across years.
- Data quality management:
  - Track NA and ND markers to understand data completeness and potential biases.
  - Flag records requiring special handling due to non-interoperable formats or legacy data structures.
- Access and discoverability:
  - Ensure PBMS dataset remains discoverable via PBMS portals and that references to the PBMS results site are preserved.
- User guidance:
  - Provide clear explanations of units, detection limits, and the meaning of TEQ and PCB congeners for end users performing trend analyses.

## End notes
- The dataset is designed to support long-term trend analyses of contaminant burdens in predatory bird eggs, with extensive congener-level PCB data and a broad suite of organochlorine and trace element measurements, accompanied by metadata to enable robust reuse and interpretation.
