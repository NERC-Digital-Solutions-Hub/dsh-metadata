# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) material and methods for egg samples

## Overview
- PBMS monitors contaminant concentrations in addled or deserted eggs to study chemical impacts on predatory birds, including rare species like golden eagle and Merlin.
- Egg-based sampling enables robust data for scarce populations where carcass sampling is impractical.
- Licensing required for any egg collection; collectors submit eggs from nests as part of other studies (primarily ringing).

## Data Collection and Processing
- For each egg: record length, breadth, weight, contents weight, collection date, and provenance.
- Processing: crack egg, extract contents, assess approximate developmental stage, homogenize contents, and archive at -20°C in glass jars.
- Shell handling: rinse, air-dry for 4 weeks, then weigh; compute shell thickness index = shell weight (mg) / (length × breadth).
  
## Core Monitoring Program Data
- Subsample approach: each year, analyze contaminants in one egg from each clutch of merlin, golden eagle, and white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla).
- Analytes: PCBs (35 congeners, total PCBs, PCB-TEQs), organochlorine (OC) insecticides, and mercury.
- Gannet eggs: ~10 g from Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig colonies, collected biennially.
- Outputs: results published in annual reports, scientific papers, and on the PBMS website.
- Stakeholder feedback: volunteer collectors receive egg biometric data and a summary of analyzed samples to maintain engagement and data quality.

## Archive and Resource
- Frozen PBMS archive dates back to 1968, totaling ~17,500 tissue samples and ~9,000 egg contents.
- The archive is a valuable resource for environmental toxicology and conservation research, enabling:
  - assessment of chemical exposure and effects on predatory birds,
  - piloting and refining new monitoring methods,
  - projects on nonchemical threats (e.g., illegal trading, hunting) and fine-scale genetic structure studies (e.g., golden eagle populations).

## Data Management and Governance (Implications for Data Leaders)
- Structured collection of morphometric and provenance data alongside chemical analyses supports end-to-end traceability from field collection to published results.
- Long-term archiving enables retrospective analyses and cross-study reuse.
- Outputs are disseminated publicly (annual reports, scientific papers, dedicated webpage), with ongoing engagement through feedback to volunteers.
- Licensing and collaboration constraints shape data access and collection workflows, while the comprehensive archive enhances discoverability and broader community value.
