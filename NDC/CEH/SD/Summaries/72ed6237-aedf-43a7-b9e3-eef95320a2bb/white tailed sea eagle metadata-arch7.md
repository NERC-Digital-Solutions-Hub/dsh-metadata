# Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme Results

## Overview
- Data generated by the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) for long-term temporal trend analysis.
- Reports and datasets available for download from the PBMS results website: http://pbms.ceh.ac.uk/results.htm

## Data Structure and Key Fields
- The dataset is a comprehensive table describing contaminant concentrations in predatory bird eggs (and related nest-site data), with a parallel focus on liver measurements for some elements.
- Core fields include:
  - Year: Four-digit year indicating when the egg was laid.
  - Egg number: Unique identifier for each egg (numbers may be numeric or alphanumeric due to historical changes in numbering systems).
  - Location: General location of the nest site.
  - Shell Index: Indicator of eggshell thickness (as described by Ratcliffe, 1970) or marked NA if not analysed.
  - CF: Lipid concentration correction factor (or NA if not applicable).
  - Contaminant measurements: A wide range of pollutants, including:
    - HCB, a-HCH, g-HCH
    - p,p-DDE, p,p-TDE, p,p-DDT
    - HEOD
    - Total PCB (and individual PCB congeners such as PCB 8, PCB 18, PCB 28, PCB 29, PCB 31, PCB 52, PCB 77, PCB 101, PCB 105, PCB 114, PCB 118, PCB 123, PCB 126, PCB 128, PCB 138, PCB 141, PCB 149, PCB 153, PCB 156, PCB 157, PCB 163, PCB 167, PCB 169, PCB 170, PCB 171, PCB 180, PCB 183, PCB 187, PCB 189, PCB 194, PCB 199, PCB 201, PCB 205, PCB 206, PCB 209).
    - TEQ: Toxic equivalencies calculated using WHO TEFs for planar and coplanar PCBs.
    - Metals and metalloids measured in homogenised egg contents or specified for liver (e.g., Al, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Zn).
- Units and data presentation:
  - For organics: concentrations often reported per g of liver on a wet weight basis (for certain entries) or per egg contents.
  - Some fields are labelled NA (Not Analysed) or ND (None Detected).
  - A lipid correction factor (CF) is provided where applicable.

## Contaminants Covered
- Persistent organic pollutants (POPs): HCB, HCH isomers, DDE, DDT, HEOD, p,p-TDE.
- Comprehensive polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with multiple congeners and total PCB values.
- Toxic equivalency (TEQ) values derived from PCB-related TEFs.
- Trace elements and metals: Al, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Zn.
- Data includes both egg contents and, where available, corresponding liver measurements.

## Data Quality, Gaps, and Annotations
- Many entries are NA (Not Analysed) or ND (None Detected), indicating incomplete coverage across all chemicals or samples.
- Yearly and locational information may be available at broad spatial scales (general nest-site location) rather than precise coordinates.
- The dataset includes a detailed column description (Column_heading: Description, Units, etc.), reflecting a data dictionary for interpretation.
- Some fields are Not Applicable for specific rows (e.g., certain shell or chemical-specific fields).

## Spatial and Temporal Coverage
- Temporal scope spans multiple years (as indicated by the Year field) and is intended for long-term trend analysis.
- Spatial scope centers on nest sites with general location descriptors; not necessarily precise geospatial coordinates in this excerpt.

## Access and Reference
- PBMS results are publicly accessible via the PBMS website, with downloadable reports and datasets available at http://pbms.ceh.ac.uk/results.htm.

## GIS Use Recommendations and Considerations
- Suitable for map-based visualization of contaminant trends by location and year (e.g., choropleth or dot maps by nest-site location and time).
- Useful to:
  - Join contaminant data to nest-site shapefiles or general location polygons to create spatial trend maps.
  - Compare temporal trends of individual contaminants (e.g., p,p-DDE, Total PCB, TEQ) across locations.
  - Create composite risk indicators by aggregating multiple contaminants or using TEQ values.
- Important caveats:
  - Precise sampling locations may be coarse; map visuals should reflect that uncertainty.
  - Data gaps exist (NA/ND entries); account for missingness in analyses and visualizations.
  - Unit differences (liver wet weight vs. egg contents) require careful harmonization before spatial aggregation or trend analysis.
  - The dataset contains a mixture of egg and liver measurements; ensure consistent spatial joins and representations across sample types.
- Practical steps:
  - Use the Year and Location fields for temporal-spatial filtering.
  - Normalize or harmonize units and apply CF where appropriate for lipid-based comparisons.
  - Clearly annotate NA/ND statuses in maps and summaries to avoid misinterpretation.
  - Reference the PBMS results site for full methodological notes and data dictionaries when creating data products.
