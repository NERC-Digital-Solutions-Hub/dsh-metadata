# ReadMe file for Biomass_N_and_CtoN.csv

## Overview
- Field trial examining greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine patches on semi-improved upland grassland.
- Corresponds to above-ground biomass harvests collected within greenhouse gas chambers (each chamber 50 cm x 50 cm).

## Study site and design
- Location: orthic podzol at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
- Treatments (n = 4): Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial sheep urine), RealUrine (real sheep urine).
- Design: Randomised block.
- Treatments applied in spring and autumn 2016.
- Biomass cuts: four times after spring treatments; three times after autumn treatments.

## Sample processing and data quality
- Biomass stored in paper bags; dried in oven at 80 °C for 24 h.
- Samples ground in a ball mill and analysed with a TruSpec® Analyzer (Leco) against certified reference materials.
- Data visually checked for errors.

## Data headers and meaning
- Sample_date: Date samples were taken.
- Plot_no: Chamber number from which above-ground biomass samples were taken.
- Treatment: 'Control', 'ArtUrine', or 'RealUrine'.
- Season: 'Spring' or 'Autumn' corresponding to when treatments were applied.
- Biomass: Above-ground biomass in g dry weight per m2.
- Foliar_N: Nitrogen content of dried/ground biomass (%).
- Foliar_CtoN: Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of biomass samples.

## Data provenance and usage notes
- Data derive from a field trial investigating greenhouse gas emissions; biomass harvests correspond to the within-chamber samples (50 cm x 50 cm).
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Analyses were performed using standard reference materials; data were visually quality-checked.

## GIS-relevant considerations
- Data are suitable for map-based visualization by Plot_no and Treatment across Seasons (Biomass, Foliar_N, Foliar_CtoN).
- To map spatial patterns, plot-level locations or linkage to spatial plot shapefiles would be needed alongside these fields.
