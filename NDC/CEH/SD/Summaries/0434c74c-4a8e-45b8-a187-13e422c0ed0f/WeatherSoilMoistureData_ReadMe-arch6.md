# ReadMe file for WeatherSoilMoistureData.csv

## Overview
- Describes WeatherSoilMoistureData.csv containing rainfall, soil temperature at 5 cm depth, air temperature, and soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 5 cm and 10 cm depths.
- Data linked to seasonal sheep urine application studies at the experimental study site.

## Site and Data Collection Details
- Location: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales; 270 m above sea level; coordinates 53°13'N, 4°0'W.
- Weather data source: Meteorological station installed at the site (Skye Instruments Ltd., Llandrindod Wells, UK).
- Soil moisture data: Calculated % water-filled pore space from 10HS moisture probes (Decagon Devices Inc., WA, USA) calibrated according to the supplier’s instructions.

## Variables and Headers
- TimeDate: Date and time of measurements (format: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss).
- Rain_mm: Rainfall in millimeters.
- SoilTemp_5cm: Soil temperature in degrees Celsius at 5 cm depth.
- AirTemp: Air temperature in degrees Celsius.
- WFPS_5: Soil water-filled pore space at 5 cm depth (percent).
- WFPS_10: Soil water-filled pore space at 10 cm depth (percent).

## Data Coverage and Context
- Measurements cover periods relevant to seasonal sheep urine application studies.
- Data headers and units are as described above; note that some headers are spelled precisely as in the file (e.g., Rain_mm, SoilTemp_5cm).

## Usage and Attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if the data are reused or reproduced. 
- Suitable for creating data products (dashboards, pivot tables, reports) to analyze rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture dynamics at the study site.
