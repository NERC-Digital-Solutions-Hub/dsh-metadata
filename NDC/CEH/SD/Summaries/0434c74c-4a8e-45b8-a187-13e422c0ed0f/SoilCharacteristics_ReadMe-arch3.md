## Overview
- Describes soil characteristics of Orthic Podzol sampled during two seasonal field trials (spring and autumn) in 2016-2017.
- Purpose linked to monitoring greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine applied to a semi-improved pasture.
- Field location: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (53°13'N, 4°0'W); 270 m above sea level; 13% slope.
- Data include measurements from control plots within spring and autumn trials (4 replicates per season).

## Study Design and Location
- Two seasonal experiments corresponding to spring and autumn emission-factor plots.
- Four replicates sampled within each season’s control plots.
- Depths and contexts for measurements include 0-5 cm (BD_SP) and 0-10 cm (Gravmoist_SP, Gravmoist_AT, C_SP, etc.).

## Measured Variables and Headers
- Physical properties:
  - BD_SP: Bulk density (0-5 cm) for spring plot, dry soil basis.
  - BD_AT: Bulk density (0-5 cm) for autumn plot, dry soil basis.
  - Gravmoist_SP: Gravimetric moisture (0-10 cm) for spring plot.
  - Gravmoist_AT: Gravimetric moisture (0-10 cm) for autumn plot.
  - Orgmat_SP / Orgmat_AT: Organic matter (% dry soil weight).
- Chemical properties:
  - pH_SP / pH_AT: Soil pH (0-10 cm) in spring/autumn.
  - EC_SP / EC_AT: Electrical conductivity (0-10 cm) in spring/autumn.
  - C_SP / C_AT: Total carbon (% dry weight, 0-10 cm).
  - N_SP / N_AT: Total nitrogen (% dry weight, 0-10 cm).
  - CN_SP / CN_AT: Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (0-10 cm).
  - Nmin_SP / Nmin_AT: Nitrogen mineralisation rate (mg N kg-1 day-1, 0-10 cm).
- Inorganic and dissolved nutrients:
  - DOC_SP / DOC_AT: Dissolved organic carbon (mg C kg-1 soil) via 0.5 M K2SO4 extraction (dry weight basis).
  - TDN_SP / TDN_AT: Total dissolved nitrogen (mg N kg-1 soil).
  - Nitrate_SP / Nitrate_AT: Nitrate (mg NO3--N kg-1 soil).
  - Ammon_SP / Ammon_AT: Ammonium (mg NH4+-N kg-1 soil).
  - Phosph_SP / Phosph_AT: Phosphate (mg PO4--P kg-1 soil).
  - Na_SP / Na_AT, K_SP / K_AT, Ca_SP / Ca_AT: Exchangeable cations via 1 M acetic acid extract (mg kg-1 soil).
- Microbial and extractable pools:
  - DOC and TDN also informed by CHCl3 fumigation-extraction for microbial biomass C, N (CK/KEN corrections applied).
  - Total dissolved C and N, and microbial biomass C and N (via CHCl3 fumigation-extraction with  KE C/KEN corrections).

## Sampling and Replication
- Seasonal sampling with 4 replicates per seasonal plot.
- Measurements include depth-specific sampling (0-5 cm and 0-10 cm ranges) to capture surface soil properties.

## Analytical Methods and Standards
- Bulk density: core method, 100 cm3 rings, corrected for stone weight and volume.
- Moisture: oven-drying at 105 °C (24 h).
- Organic matter: loss-on-ignition (Ball, 1964).
- Total C and N: measured with TruSpec analyzer (Leco) against reference standards.
- N mineralisation: based on Waring and Bremner (1964); NH4+ by Mulvaney (1996) in 1:10 soil:solution extracts.
- Nitrate: Miranda et al. (2001) method.
- Dissolved organic C/N and microbial biomass: CHCl3 fumigation-extraction (Voroney et al., 2008) with KEC/KEN corrections.
- Phosphate and cations: Murphy and Riley (1962) for PO4--P; 1 M acetic acid extracts for Na, K, Ca; measured with flame photometer.
- QA/control: solutions analyzed against matrix-matched certified reference standards; blanks where appropriate; data visually checked for QA.

## Data Quality, Metadata, and Provenance
- Detailed header key definitions provided for all variables (e.g., BD_SP, BD_AT, Gravmoist_SP, etc.), including depth and dry-weight basis.
- Methods and references explicitly cited to support reproducibility (Ball 1964; Miranda 2001; Mulvaney 1996; Voroney 2008; Waring & Bremner 1964).
- Author attribution requirement: “Authors must be acknowledged if the data are re-used or reproduced.”

## Access, Attribution, and Use
- Acknowledgement required for data reuse; no explicit licensing terms stated beyond attribution.
- Data are context-specific (site, year, and plot design) but are described with comprehensive metadata to enable reuse and cross-site comparability.

## Relevance to Monitoring Frameworks and Policy
- Provides a comprehensive, method-standardized soil dataset relevant to environmental health monitoring and greenhouse gas research linked to agricultural inputs.
- Rich metadata and standardized measurements enable benchmarking, trend analysis, and cross-site comparisons for policy evaluation.
- Highlights governance considerations: data provenance, metadata completeness, QA, and attribution, which are important for transparent monitoring frameworks.

## Limitations and Considerations for Policy Use
- Site-specific study with limited temporal coverage (spring/autumn 2016-2017) and replication; extrapolation to broader scales should be cautious.
- Access and reuse depend on attribution, and public availability status is not specified; may affect timeliness of data use in policy settings.
- Would benefit from broader spatial coverage, longer-term sampling, and harmonized data schemas for routine monitoring.
