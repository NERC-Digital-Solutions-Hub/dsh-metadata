# CH4 emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol within a semiimproved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) in autumn, 2016.

## Overview
- Dataset of CH4 flux measurements from three treatments: Control (no urine), artificial urine (ArtUrine), and real sheep urine (Urine).
- Experimental design: randomized block layout conducted on orthic podzol within semiimproved upland grassland.
- Location and timing: Henfaes Research Station, North Wales, autumn 2016.

## Methods and instruments
- Measurement system: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system with a SRI 8610 GC.
- Sampling frequency: eight CH4 flux measurements per chamber per day (1-hour chamber closure; four gas samples per hour), with calibration after every fourth sample.
- Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H).
- Data type: quality-assessed flux data (not raw gas concentrations); subjected to quality assurance by inspecting raw files and GC chromatograms for anomalies and removing problematic data.

## Experimental design and location
- Design: randomized block experimental design with plots assigned to Control, ArtUrine, or Urine within the block structure.
- Geographical details: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales, at approximately 270 m above sea level; coordinates 53°13'N, 4°0'W.

## Data structure and content
- Data include high-frequency flux measurements; not raw concentration data.
- Data headers:
  - Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
  - Columns B to M: CH4 flux values in mg CH4-C m-2 h-1
  - Column headers encode treatment and chamber/plot numbers (e.g., Control, ArtUrine, Urine).

## Data processing and quality
- Quality assurance: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; anomalous data removed as necessary.
- Focused on delivering quality-assessed flux data suitable for analysis rather than raw gas concentrations.

## Usage notes and provenance
- Authors must be acknowledged if the data are reused or reproduced.
- Data can be used to compare CH4 flux responses across treatments and to support modelling of emission responses to urine treatments in upland grassland contexts.

## Practical implications for analysis
- Suitable for identifying correlations between urine treatments and CH4 flux changes.
- Enables comparison of artificial vs. real urine effects relative to the control.
- Provides a basis for developing predictive models of methane emissions under different urine deposition scenarios in similar ecosystems.
