# CH4 emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol within a semiimproved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) in autumn, 2016.

## Study context and design
- Measurements focus on gas fluxes from plots treated with control (no urine), artificial sheep urine, and real sheep urine.
- Location: Henfaes Research Station, North Wales; upland grassland on orthic podzol, 270 m above sea level.
- Experimental design: randomised block design.
- Emissions reported pertain to periods analyzed with an automated monitoring system; the description notes CH4 in the narrative, but data headers pertain to CO2 fluxes.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Monitoring system: automated greenhouse gas flux monitoring system; LI-COR LI-820 connected to gas chromatography (GC) analysis.
- Data cadence: eight flux measurements per chamber per day; 1-hour chamber closure with four gas samples analyzed per closure period.
- Calibration: calibration standard analysed after every fourth gas sample.
- Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (l x w x h).

## Data content and structure
- Data type: high-frequency flux data produced by the automated system; described as quality-assessed emissions data rather than raw gas concentrations.
- Data headers: Timestamp format is dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Columns: Columns B to M represent CO2 fluxes (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1).
- Metadata within headers: information on treatment (Control, ArtUrine, Urine) and chamber/plot numbers.

## Quality assurance and processing
- Quality assurance (QA): inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removal of problematic data (e.g., gas-peak interferences) as needed.
- Data processing stage: the dataset reflects QA-cleaned flux data suitable for reporting, not raw concentration data.

## Metadata, sharing and governance
- Data reuse: authors must be acknowledged if data are re-used or reproduced.
- Data openness: mentions of sharing underlying data; potential barriers include metadata completeness and access to datasets.
- Data management considerations: dataset provides structured headers and treatment/plot identifiers to support traceability and reuse.

## Notes and caveats
- Inconsistency to note: the narrative describes CH4 emissions, while the data columns describe CO2 fluxes; users should verify which gas fluxes are represented in the provided files and accompanying documentation.
