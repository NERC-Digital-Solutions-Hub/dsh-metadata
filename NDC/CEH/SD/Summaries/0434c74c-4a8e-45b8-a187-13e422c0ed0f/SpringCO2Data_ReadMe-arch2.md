# ReadMe file for SpringCO2Data.csv

- Purpose and scope
  - Document describes CO2 emissions flux data from soil under three treatments (Control, artificial urine, real urine) in a randomized block experiment.
  - Location: orthic podzol within semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W), recorded in spring 2016.
  - Objective: provide quality-assessed, standardized flux data suitable for environmental monitoring and policy-relevant analyses.

- Data collection and monitoring setup
  - Instrumentation: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system using LI-COR LI-820.
  - Measurement protocol: eight CO2 flux measurements per chamber per day; 1-hour chamber closure; four gas samples analyzed per closure.
  - Calibration: calibration standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample.
  - Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (l x w x h).

- Data content and format
  - The dataset contains quality-assessed CO2 flux data, not raw gas concentration data.
  - Timestamp format: dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
  - Flux values: columns B to M represent CO2 fluxes in mg CO2-C m-2 h-1.
  - Treatment and plot information embedded in column headers (Control, ArtUrine, Urine) and chamber/plot identifiers.

- Quality assurance and data processing
  - Data quality checks included inspection of raw data files and chromatograms for anomalies; data removed if necessary (e.g., gas peak interference).
  - Emphasizes that outputs are cleaned/quality-assured flux data ready for analysis.

- Data provenance and usage guidance
  - Authors should be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
  - Data are presented in standardized formats to support monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Encouraged to increase data value by linking with additional relevant datasets and enabling access to underlying data.

- Practical notes for analysts
  - The dataset is suitable for comparative analyses across treatments and time within the monitored environment.
  - Consider integrating with broader environmental datasets to enhance interpretation and utility for monitoring programs.
