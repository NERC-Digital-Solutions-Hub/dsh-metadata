# CH4 emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol within a semiimproved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) in autumn, 2016

- Overview
  - Dataset of methane (CH4) emissions from plots with three treatments: Control (no urine), artificial urine, and real sheep urine.
  - Study conducted on an orthic podzol within semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales, autumn 2016.
  - Experimental design: randomized block.
  - Data are high-frequency, quality-assessed flux measurements rather than raw gas concentrations.

- Data collection and methods
  - Instrumentation: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (SRI 8610 GC) supplied by Queensland University of Technology, Institute For Future Environments.
  - Flux measurement protocol: eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1 h chamber closure; 4 gas samples analyzed per 1 h period).
  - Calibration: calibration standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample.
  - Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m2; chambers 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H).
  - Data type: high-frequency flux data (not raw gas concentrations).
  - Quality assurance: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removal of anomalous data where necessary (e.g., peak interference).

- Experimental design and location
  - Treatments: Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real urine).
  - Plot design: randomised block.
  - Location details: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales; altitude 270 m above sea level; coordinates 53°13'N, 4°0'W.
  - Data collection period: autumn 2016.

- Data structure and content
  - Timestamp format: dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
  - CH4 flux columns: B to M represent CH4 fluxes in mg CH4-C m-2 h-1.
  - Column headers encode treatment and chamber/plot identifiers (e.g., Control, ArtUrine, Urine).

- Quality assurance and data processing notes
  - Only flux data that passed QA are included; not raw gas concentration data.
  - Anomalies detected via raw data files and GC chromatograms were removed as appropriate to ensure data quality.

- Data usage and attribution
  - Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
  - Data are suitable for environmental monitoring analyses to assess CH4 emissions response to urine treatments and to support long-term environmental health and policy performance evaluations.

- Data management and accessibility (analyst perspective)
  - Prepared for integration with standard environmental monitoring formats.
  - Emphasizes clear, standardized outputs (flux values with timestamped records) suitable for visualization (maps, charts) and cross-study comparability.
  - Data should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals, aligning with typical monitoring program practices.
