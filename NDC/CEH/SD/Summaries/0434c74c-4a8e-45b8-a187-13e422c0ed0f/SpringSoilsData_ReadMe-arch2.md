# ReadMe file for SpringSoilsData.csv

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes ancillary soil measurements accompanying greenhouse gas flux data from a field trial assessing emissions from sheep urine patches on a semi-improved upland grassland.
  - Data intended to support monitoring of soil chemical and moisture status over time to evaluate environmental health and treatment effects.

- Study site and context
  - Location: orthic podzol at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
  - Established: Spring 2016.
  - Experimental context: plots with control, artificial urine, and real sheep urine patches; randomised block design.

- Experimental design and sampling
  - Treatments: Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial urine), RealUrine (real sheep urine).
  - Replication: n = 4 plots per treatment (total 12 plots).
  - Sampling framework: soil samples collected from each plot (n = 3 bulked per replicate plot) at 0–10 cm depth using a 1.3 cm diameter auger.
  - Timeframe: data collected over one year following treatment application; dates provided within the data file.

- Measurements and units
  - Gravimetric soil moisture (Gravmoist): % on a dry weight basis.
  - pH: soil pH at sampling.
  - EC: electrical conductivity (µS cm-1) at sampling.
  - Nitrate: extractable nitrate (mg NO3--N kg-1 soil dry weight) via 0.5 M K2SO4 extraction.
  - Ammonium: extractable ammonium (mg NH4+-N kg-1 soil dry weight) via 0.5 M K2SO4 extraction.
  - TDN: total dissolved nitrogen (mg N kg-1 soil dry weight) via 0.5 M K2SO4 extraction.
  - DOC: dissolved organic carbon (mg C kg-1 soil dry weight) via 0.5 M K2SO4 extraction.
  - Analytical methods for nitrate and ammonium referenced (Miranda et al., 2001; Mulvaney, 1996); spectrophotometry and a Multi N/C 2100S analyser for TDN and DOC.

- Data collection and quality assurance
  - Procedures included blanks, calibration curve checks, dilution and re-analysis when needed.
  - Calibration curves were validated for precision; data were visually checked and corrected for errors.

- Data structure and headers
  - Key columns: Plot, Date, Days_after, Tmnt (treatment), Gravmoist, pH, EC, Nitrate, Ammon, TDN, DOC.
  - Plot corresponds to plot and chamber identifiers; Date indicates sampling date; Days_after represents days relative to treatment; Tmnt indicates treatment type.

- Data handling and dissemination
  - Samples refrigerated after collection and processed within 24 hours.
  - Soil moisture and chemical measurements performed using standardized methods and referenced procedures.
  - Data intended to be stored and, where appropriate, uploaded to relevant data portals.

- Location and timing details
  - Sampling occurred over a year following the 2016 treatment application at the Henfaes site; dates are included in the dataset.
