# ReadMe file for SpringCO2Data.csv

- Authors must be acknowledged if data are re-used or reproduced.
- Context: CO2 emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol within a semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) in spring, 2016. Emissions were monitored from plots based on a randomised block experimental design.
- Data collection: Automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (LI-COR LI-820) producing eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1 h chamber closure period; 4 gas samples analysed per 1 h closure period), with a calibration standard analysed after every fourth gas sample introduced into the GC.
- Chamber specs: Basal area 0.25 m2; chambers 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (l x w x h).
- Data included: Represent the quality-assessed flux data, not raw gas concentration data.
- Quality Assurance: Inspect raw data files and chromatograms for anomalies and remove if necessary (e.g., interference in gas peaks).
- Data headers: Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm. Columns B to M represent the CO2 fluxes (all in mg CO2-C m-2 h-1). Column headers provide information on the treatment and the chamber/plot numbers, where Control = Control treatment, ArtUrine = artificial urine treatment and Urine = real urine treatment.
