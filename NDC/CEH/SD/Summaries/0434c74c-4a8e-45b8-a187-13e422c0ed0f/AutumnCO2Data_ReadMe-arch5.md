## Summary for Data Stewards
- Purpose and scope: Dataset pertains to gas emissions measurements from a grassland experiment conducted autumn 2016 at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales, using control (no urine), artificial urine, and real urine treatments in a randomised block design.
- Location and timing: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W); autumn 2016.
- Measurement system: Automated greenhouse gas monitoring system with LI-COR LI-820; eight flux measurements per chamber per day with 1 hour chamber closures; four gas samples analyzed per closure; calibration standard after every fourth gas sample.
- Experimental setup: Chamber basal area 0.25 m2; chambers 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H); plots organized in a randomised block design.
- Data content and type: High-frequency flux data produced by the automated system; not raw gas concentration data. Data headers indicate Timestamp and flux columns for CO2 (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1) across treatments and chamber/plot numbers.
- Treatments: Control, ArtUrine (artificial urine), and Urine (real urine).
- Data quality and processing: Quality assurance involved inspecting raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies and removing anomalous data as needed; data represent quality-assessed flux data after QA, not raw concentrations.
- Inconsistencies and notes: Text mentions CH4 emissions, but the data columns are labeled as CO2 fluxes; please verify consistency between stated emissions (CH4) and recorded data (CO2).
- Data structure: Headers include Timestamp in dd/mm/yy hh:mm format; columns B–M contain CO2 fluxes; explicit labeling of treatment and plot/chamber identifiers.
- Authorship and reuse: Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Governance implications: Data are suitable for sharing within portals/catalogues as quality-filtered emissions data; ensure metadata captures processing steps, QA actions, and any anomalies or removals; document any embargoes or access restrictions if applicable.
- Metadata considerations for cataloging: Include location, site, coordinates, altitude, date, experimental design, chamber dimensions, measurement frequency, instrument model, calibration routine, data processing steps, units (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1), treatment codes, and timestamp format; note potential CH4/CO2 labeling discrepancy.
