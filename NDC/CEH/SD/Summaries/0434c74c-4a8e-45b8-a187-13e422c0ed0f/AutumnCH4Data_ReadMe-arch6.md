# CH4 emissions from control and urine-treated plots in semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (autumn 2016)

## Study context and location
- Emissions data collected from control (no urine), artificial urine (ArtUrine), and real urine (Urine) treatments.
- Location: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales; 270 m above sea level; coordinates 53°13'N, 4°0'W.
- Experimental design: randomized block.
- Plot/chamber geometry: chamber basal area 0.25 m²; chambers 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (l × w × h).

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Instrumentation: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system from Queensland University of Technology, Institute For Future Environments; GC model SRI 8610 (Torrance, USA).
- Data cadence: eight CH4 flux measurements per chamber per day.
  - Each measurement cycle: 1-hour chamber closure with four gas samples analyzed per closure.
  - Calibration: standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample.
- Data focus: high-frequency CH4 flux data (not raw gas concentrations).

## Data content and structure
- Data represent quality-assessed CH4 flux data, not raw concentration data.
- Time format: Timestamp = dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- CH4 flux columns: Columns B to M contain flux values in mg CH4-C m⁻² h⁻¹.
- Treatment/plot identifiers embedded in headers: Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real urine); each corresponding to specific chamber/plot numbers.

## Quality assurance and data processing
- QA processes include inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies.
- Any anomalies (e.g., gas peak interference) are removed from the dataset as necessary.

## Metadata and usage notes
- Headers provide clear linkage between time, treatment, and chamber/plot identity.
- Data are intended for analysis of CH4 flux patterns across treatments and plots, using the high-frequency measurements supplied.
- Acknowledgement requirement: authors must be acknowledged if the data are reused or reproduced.
