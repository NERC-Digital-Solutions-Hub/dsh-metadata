# UrineVol.csv

## Overview
- Dataset of individual urine event volumes from Welsh Mountain ewes (n = 6).
- Collected during urine collection trials in spring 2016 and autumn 2016.
- Used to determine a mean urine volume to parameterize greenhouse gas chambers as representative of a typical sheep urination event.

## Data and Measurements
- Volume_SP: Volume of each individual urine event (ml) from the spring 2016 trial at the middle ffridd, Henfaes research station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales; corrected for losses in the urine collection apparatus.
- Volume_AT: Volume of each individual urine event (ml) from the autumn 2016 trial at the same site; corrected for losses in the urine collection apparatus.

## Sample and Timing
- 6 Welsh Mountain ewes.
- Trials conducted in spring 2016 and autumn 2016 at Henfaes research station, North Wales.

## Use and Interpretation
- Data provide a basis for calculating a mean urine volume to apply in greenhouse gas chamber simulations for a typical urination event in sheep.

## Data Quality and Limitations
- Small sample size (n=6) and limited to a single site and two seasons.
- Volumes are corrected for collection apparatus losses; details on correction methods are specified in the dataset.

## Author and Attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are re-used or reproduced.

## Potential Analyses
- Compute mean and variability; compare spring vs autumn volumes.
- Build simple predictive estimates for urine volume in related environmental modeling or GHG studies.

## Reusability and Metadata
- Dataset includes Volume_SP and Volume_AT with explicit site and time context, aiding reproducibility and integration with related datasets.
