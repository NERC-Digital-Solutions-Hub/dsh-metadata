# Ancillary soil measurements accompanying greenhouse gas flux measurements

- Purpose and scope: Describes ancillary soil measurements collected alongside a field trial investigating greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine patches in semi-improved upland grassland; soil data accompany the greenhouse gas flux measurements.

- Field site and design: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W); orthic podzol; established autumn 2016; randomised block design with plots assigned to treatments.

- Treatments and replication: 
  - Treatments: Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial urine), RealUrine (real sheep urine).
  - Replication: Four replicate plots per treatment (n = 4 per treatment per replicate).
  - Sampling unit: Soil samples from plots near chambers used for GHG flux measurements.

- Urine application rates: 
  - Artificial urine: 1004 kg N per hectare.
  - Real sheep urine: 1112 kg N per hectare.

- Sampling details: 
  - Depth: 0–10 cm soil.
  - Sampling scheme: Time-series spanning one year after treatment; dates and frequency recorded in the data file.
  - Sample handling: Soil samples refrigerated after collection and processed within 24 hours.
  - Soil moisture: Determined by oven-drying to a constant weight (24 h at 105 °C).

- Laboratory measurements and methods: 
  - pH and EC measured on soil slurries (1:2.5 soil-to-distilled water).
  - Extraction: 0.5 M K2SO4 (1:5 soil-to-solution) for nitrate, ammonium, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
  - Nitrate determination: Miranda et al. (2001) method; analysis by spectrophotometer; calibration with matrix-matched 6-point curves.
  - Ammonium determination: Mulvaney (1996) method; analysis by spectrophotometer; calibration with matrix-matched 6-point curves.
  - TD N and DOC analysis: Multi N/C 2100S (AnalytikJena) with matrix-matched 6-point calibration.
  - QA procedures: Procedural blanks, visual inspection of calibration curves, dilution and re-analysis as needed; calibration curves checked for precision; calculations visually checked and corrected as needed.
  - Detection limits: Zero values indicate concentrations below detection limits.

- Data structure and headers: 
  - Plot: Plot and chamber identifier.
  - Date: Sampling date (dd/mm/yy).
  - Days_after: Days before/after treatment.
  - Tmnt: Treatment code (Control, ArtUrine, RealUrine).
  - Gravmoist: Gravimetric soil moisture content (% dry weight) at sampling.
  - pH: Soil pH at sampling.
  - EC: Electrical conductivity (µS cm-1) at sampling.
  - Nitrate: 0.5 M K2SO4 extractable nitrate (mg NO3--N kg-1 soil dry weight).
  - Ammon: 0.5 M K2SO4 extractable ammonium (mg NH4+-N kg-1 soil dry weight).
  - TDN: 0.5 M K2SO4 extractable total dissolved nitrogen (mg N kg-1 soil dry weight).
  - DOC: 0.5 M K2SO4 extractable total dissolved organic carbon (mg C kg-1 soil dry weight).

- Data quality and limitations: Includes notes on below-detection-limit values (reported as zero) and the need for calibration and QA procedures; data verified and corrected where necessary.
