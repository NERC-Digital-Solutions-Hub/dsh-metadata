- Overview: Field-trial dataset investigating greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine patches on semi-improved upland grassland; corresponds to above-ground biomass harvests within 50 cm x 50 cm greenhouse gas chambers.

- Location and design:
  - Site: orthic podzol, Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W)
  - Experimental design: randomised block
  - Treatments (n = 4): Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial sheep urine), RealUrine (real sheep urine)
  - Treatment timing: applied in spring and autumn 2016

- Sampling and processing:
  - Biomass cuts: four times after spring applications; three times after autumn applications
  - Sample handling: stored in paper bags, oven-dried at 80 °C for 24 h
  - Analysis: ground in a ball mill; measured with a TruSpec® Analyzer (Leco) against certified reference materials
  - Quality control: data visually checked for errors

- Data structure and headers:
  - Sample_date: date of sampling
  - Plot_no: chamber number from which biomass samples were taken
  - Treatment: Control, ArtUrine, RealUrine
  - Season: Spring or Autumn corresponding to treatment application
  - Biomass: above-ground biomass in g dry weight per m²
  - Foliar_N: nitrogen content of dried and ground biomass (%)
  - Foliar_CtoN: carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of biomass samples

- Usage notes:
  - Data derived from field trials examining urine treatment effects on biomass and elemental composition
  - Authors should be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced
  - Suitable for analyses linking biomass production and foliar N content/C:N ratios under different urine treatments within greenhouse gas chamber contexts
