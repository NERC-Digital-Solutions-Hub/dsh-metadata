# The data corresponds to CH4 emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol within a semiimproved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) in autumn, 2016.

- Overview
  - CH4 emissions data collected from plots with three treatments: Control (no urine), artificial urine (ArtUrine), and real sheep urine (Urine).
  - Study design: randomised block experiment conducted on an orthic podzol within semi-improved upland grassland.
  - Purpose aligns with environmental monitoring needs to scrutinise and evaluate policy-relevant emissions measures.

- Experimental setup
  - Site details: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales; elevation 270 m a.s.l.; coordinates 53°13'N, 4°0'W.
  - Soil/vegetation context: orthic podzol on semi-improved upland grassland.
  - Plots and chambers: chamber basal area 0.25 m2; chamber dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H).

- Treatments and design
  - Treatments applied to plots according to randomised block design.
  - Treatment labels: Control, ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real urine).

- Data collection and instruments
  - Measurement system: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system; CH4 was quantified via a gas chromatograph (SRI 8610 GC, Torrance, USA) with data processing affiliated with Queensland University of Technology, Institute For Future Environments.
  - Sampling cadence: eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1-hour chamber closure period; 4 gas samples analyzed per 1-hour closure).
  - Quality control during sampling: calibration standard analysed after every fourth gas sample; consistent calibration protocol.

- Data content and structure
  - Data type: quality-assessed CH4 flux data (not raw gas concentration data).
  - Units: flux expressed as mg CH4-C m-2 h-1.
  - Time-stamping: Timestamp format is dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
  - Data columns: Headers B to M represent CH4 fluxes; each column corresponds to a specific treatment and chamber/plot combination.
  - Metadata in headers: column headers encode treatment (Control, ArtUrine, Urine) and chamber/plot identifiers.

- Data processing and quality assurance
  - QA procedures: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms to identify and remove anomalies (e.g., gas peak interference).
  - Data represent period(s) analyzed by the automated system with high-frequency measurements; not raw gas concentration data.

- Data provenance and sharing considerations
  - Acknowledgement requirement: authors must be acknowledged if the data are re-used or reproduced.
  - Data governance: data are structured with explicit treatment and spatial identifiers; potential metadata gaps may arise if sharing beyond the provided headers.
  - Public sharing and openness: dissemination and stakeholder consultation are relevant, with emphasis on sharing underlying data appropriately.

- Implications for monitoring framework development
  - Highlights the need for clear metadata (timestamp, treatment, chamber/plot mapping) and consistent units to ensure data interoperability.
  - Demonstrates common challenges: data quality assurance, handling high-frequency datasets, and balancing data openness with data governance.
  - Illustrates practical instrumentation and QA workflows that can inform monitoring framework standards and data management requirements for policy-relevant environmental metrics.
