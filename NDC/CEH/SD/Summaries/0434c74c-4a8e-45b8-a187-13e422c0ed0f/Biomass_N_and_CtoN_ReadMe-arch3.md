# ReadMe file for Biomass_N_and_CtoN.csv

## Overview
- Field trial to investigate greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine patches deposited on a semi-improved upland grassland.
- Data correspond to above-ground biomass harvests within greenhouse gas chambers (each 50 cm x 50 cm).
- Location: orthic podzol at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
- Treatments: Control (no urine), Artificial sheep urine (ArtUrine), Real sheep urine (RealUrine).
- Experimental design: randomised block design with four treatments applied in spring and autumn of 2016.
- Biomass collection: four harvests after spring treatments; three harvests after autumn treatments.
- Sample processing: biomass stored in paper bags, dried at 80 °C for 24 h, ground, and analyzed with a TruSpec® Analyzer against certified reference materials.
- Data quality: data visually checked for errors.

## Experimental Design and Site
- Site type: upland grassland on an orthic podzol.
- Trial details: conducted in spring and autumn 2016; treatments implemented in a randomised block design.
- Treatments (n = 4) include Control, ArtUrine, and RealUrine.

## Data Collected and Headers
- Sample_date: Date samples were taken.
- Plot_no: Chamber number from which biomass samples were taken.
- Treatment: Treatment corresponding to each sample (Control, ArtUrine, RealUrine).
- Season: Season when treatments were applied (Spring, Autumn).
- Biomass: Above-ground biomass in g dry weight m-2.
- Foliar_N: Nitrogen content of dried and ground biomass (%).
- Foliar_CtoN: Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of biomass samples.

## Data Processing and Analysis
- Biomass samples dried and prepared as described; ground in a ball mill.
- Chemical analysis performed with a TruSpec® Analyzer; calibrated against certified reference materials.
- Data were visually checked for errors prior to summarisation.

## Data Governance and Usage
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Data originate from a controlled field trial; intended use includes assessment of greenhouse gas emissions related to urine patches and related biomass metrics.
- Metadata and methodological details provided to support data interpretation and reuse.
- Data handling steps (storage, drying, grinding, analysis) documented to support transparency and reproducibility.

## Considerations for Monitoring Frameworks
- Provides a clear example of linking treatments, sampling schedule, and biomass/N content metrics to environmental health questions.
- Demonstrates end-to-end data provenance, from field collection to laboratory analysis, with explicit QA steps.
- Highlights the importance of metadata completeness (treatment, date, plot, season, units) for integration into monitoring dashboards or policy evaluations.
- Note on governance: author acknowledgment required for reuse, and emphasis on data transparency and standardised processing.

## Reuse and Citations
- When reusing, acknowledge the authors as stated in the ReadMe; data are derived from a specified field trial and accompanied by detailed processing and header definitions to enable proper interpretation.
