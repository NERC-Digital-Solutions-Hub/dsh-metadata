# UrineVol.csv

- Authors must be acknowledged if data are re-used or reproduced, indicating an attribution requirement for reuse.
- Purpose: describes volumes of individual sheep urine events used to determine a mean urine volume representative for modeling greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urination.
- Dataset scope: Welsh Mountain ewes (n = 6) sampled across two trials in spring 2016 and autumn 2016.
- Collection context: trials conducted at the middle ffridd, Henfaes research station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales during spring 2016 and autumn 2016.
- Data corrections: volumes corrected for losses within the urine collection apparatus.
- Key variables:
  - Volume_SP: Volume (ml) of each individual urine event collected during spring 2016.
  - Volume_AT: Volume (ml) of each individual urine event collected during autumn 2016.
- Data format: CSV (UrineVol.csv).
- Data usage implications: the dataset is intended to inform the mean urine volume used in greenhouse gas chamber modeling to reflect a typical sheep urination event.
- Data quality and limitations:
  - Small sample size (n = 6) limits generalizability.
  - Specific flock and location; may not generalize to other breeds or settings.
  - Metadata provided focuses on collection context and corrections; additional metadata (sampling scheme, timestamps, measurement uncertainty) could enhance interoperability.
- Governance and reuse considerations:
  - Explicit attribution requirement for reuse.
  - Clear definitions of variables and corrected volumes support traceability and reproducibility, aiding data discovery and validation.
- Recommendations for data leaders:
  - Ensure discoverability by listing in data catalogs with metadata on population, timescale, and collection methods.
  - Consider linking to broader datasets or projections used for greenhouse gas modeling to contextualize the mean urine volume.
  - Document any further quality checks, uncertainties, or standardization steps to improve data interoperability across projects.
