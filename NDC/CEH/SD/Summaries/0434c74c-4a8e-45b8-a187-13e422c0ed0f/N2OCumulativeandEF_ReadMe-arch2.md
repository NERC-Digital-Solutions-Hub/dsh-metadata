# ReadMe file for N2OCumulativeandEF.csv

## Overview
- Presents annual cumulative N2O emissions and N2O-N emission factors from three treatments (Control, ArtUrine, RealUrine) applied to orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales, measured in spring and autumn 2016.
- Location: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).

## Experimental design
- Randomised block design.
- Treatments:
  - Control: no urine application
  - ArtUrine: artificial sheep urine
  - RealUrine: real sheep urine
- N application rates (kg N ha-1):
  - Spring: ArtUrine 1066; RealUrine 756
  - Autumn: ArtUrine 1004; RealUrine 1112

## Data collection and calculations
- N2O emissions were measured with chambers; cumulative emissions derived as the area under the emission curve for each chamber in each season.
- Emission factors (N2O-N_EF) calculated as a percentage of total N applied, corrected for the chamber area not covered by urine (patch application).
- Data were visually checked for errors.

## Data files and structure
- Primary dataset: N2OCumulativeandEF.csv
- Supplemental datasets for instrumentation details: SpringN2OData.csv and AutumnN2OData.csv
- Data headers:
  - Treatment: Control, ArtUrine, RealUrine
  - Chamber_no: chamber identifier
  - Season: Spring 2016 or Autumn 2016
  - Cumulative_N2O: cumulative N2O emissions (micrograms N2O-N over 1 year)
  - N2O-N_EF: emission factor (% of total N applied)

## Data quality and provenance
- Data quality assurance: visual checks for errors.
- Authorship acknowledgment required if data are reused or reproduced.

## Context for environmental monitoring
- Demonstrates standardised data collection to support assessment of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Facilitates cross-study data integration and value by enabling access to underlying data (SpringN2OData.csv and AutumnN2OData.csv provide data collection/instrumentation details).
