# ReadMe file for N2OCumulativeandEF.csv

- Purpose of the data: Annual cumulative N2O emissions and N2O-N emission factors resulting from applying control (no urine), artificial sheep urine, and real sheep urine to an orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales, during spring and autumn 2016.
- Experimental design: Randomised block design conducted at 270 m a.s.l. (53°13'N, 4°0'W).
- Treatments: Control, ArtUrine (artificial urine), RealUrine (real sheep urine).
- N application rates by season:
  - Spring: ArtUrine 1066 kg N ha-1; RealUrine 756 kg N ha-1.
  - Autumn: ArtUrine 1004 kg N ha-1; RealUrine 1112 kg N ha-1.
- Data collection and metrics:
  - Cumulative_N2O: Cumulative N2O emissions per chamber over 1 year (µg N2O-N).
  - N2O-N_EF: Emission factor as a percent of total N applied.
  - Emissions calculated from the area under the curve of each replicate chamber; EF corrected for the chamber area not receiving urine due to discrete patch application.
- Data structure:
