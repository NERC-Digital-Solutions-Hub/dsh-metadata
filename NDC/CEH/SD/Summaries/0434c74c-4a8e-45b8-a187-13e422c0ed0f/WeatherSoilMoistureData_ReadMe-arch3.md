# ReadMe file for WeatherSoilMoistureData.csv

## Overview
- Dataset records rainfall, soil temperature at 5 cm, air temperature, and soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 5 cm and 10 cm depths.
- Collected at the experimental study site for seasonal sheep urine application studies.
- Data are intended to support environmental monitoring, analysis, and decision-making related to soil moisture and weather conditions.

## Site and data sources
- Location: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales; 270 m above sea level; 53°13'N, 4°0'W.
- Weather data source: Meteorological station installed at the site (Skye Instruments Ltd., Llandrindod Wells, UK).
- Soil moisture data source: 10HS Moisture Sensor (Decagon Devices Inc., WA, USA).

## Measurements and processing
- Soil moisture calculations: WFPS values derived from sensor data, calibrated for volumetric water content according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Data processing: Measurements are combined to provide a coherent record of rainfall, soil temperature, air temperature, and soil moisture status.

## Data headers and units
- TimeDate: Date and time of measurements (dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss)
- Rain_mm: Rainfall in millimeters
- SoilTemp_5cm: Soil temperature at 5 cm depth in °C
- AirTemp: Air temperature in °C
- WFPS_5: Soil water-filled pore space at 5 cm depth in %
- WFPS_10: Soil water-filled pore space at 10 cm depth in %

## Data quality, provenance, and attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Data are collected and processed with calibration steps following manufacturer instructions to ensure accuracy and traceability.
- Clear documentation of data sources (site, instruments, and depths) supports reproducibility and governance.

## Temporal coverage
- Measurements were taken across seasonal durations associated with the sheep urine application studies (dates encompassed by the dataset correspond to the study period).
