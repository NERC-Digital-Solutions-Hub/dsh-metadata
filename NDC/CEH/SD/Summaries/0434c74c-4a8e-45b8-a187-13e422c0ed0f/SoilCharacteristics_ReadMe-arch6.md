## Overview
- Describes soil characteristics of Orthic Podzol at the Henfaes Research Station, North Wales.
- Collected during two seasonal field trials (spring and autumn) in 2016-2017 to monitor greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine applied to a semi-improved pasture.
- Experimental site details: 53°13'N, 4°0'W; ~270 m above sea level; slope 13%.
- Four replicates from control plots within both spring and autumn seasonal plots.
- Data include various soil properties measured at specified depths, with values corrected for stones where applicable.

## Data content and structure
- Measurements cover physical, chemical, and biological soil properties.
- Depths:
  - Bulk Density (BD_SP, BD_AT): 0–5 cm (g cm-3), corrected for stone weight/volume.
  - Gravimetric Moisture (Gravmoist_SP, Gravmoist_AT): 0–10 cm (% dry weight basis).
  - Organic Matter (Orgmat_SP, Orgmat_AT): % of dry soil weight.
  - pH_SP, pH_AT: soil pH (0–10 cm).
  - EC_SP, EC_AT: electrical conductivity (µS cm-1, 0–10 cm).
  - C_SP, C_AT: total carbon (% dry weight, 0–10 cm).
  - N_SP, N_AT: total nitrogen (% dry weight, 0–10 cm).
  - CN_SP, CN_AT: carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (0–10 cm).
  - Nmin_SP, Nmin_AT: nitrogen mineralisation rate (mg N kg-1 day-1, 0–10 cm).
  - DOC_SP, DOC_AT: dissolved organic carbon (mg C kg-1 soil, 0–10 cm).
  - TDN_SP, TDN_AT: total dissolved nitrogen (mg N kg-1 soil, 0–10 cm).
  - Nitrate_SP, Nitrate_AT: extractable nitrate (mg NO3--N kg-1 soil, 0–10 cm).
  - Ammon_SP, Ammon_AT: extractable ammonium (mg NH4+-N kg-1 soil, 0–10 cm).
  - Phosph_SP, Phosph_AT: extractable phosphate (mg PO4--P kg-1 soil, 0–10 cm) using 1 M acetic acid.
  - Na_SP, Na_AT: extractable sodium (mg Na kg-1 soil).
  - K_SP, K_AT: extractable potassium (mg K kg-1 soil).
  - Ca_SP, Ca_AT: extractable calcium (mg Ca kg-1 soil).
- Units and basis:
  - All results are on a dry soil weight basis where specified, with depths as noted above.
  - Values are determined using standard laboratory techniques and calibrated against certified reference materials.

## Data collection and measurement methods
- Bulk density: 100 cm3 metal rings inserted into soil; cores oven-dried at 105 °C; stones removed and density corrected.
- Gravimetric moisture: soil dried at 105 °C for 24 h.
- Organic matter: loss-on-ignition method (Ball 1964).
- pH and EC: 1:2.5 soil-to-distilled water suspensions; measurements after calibration with standard buffers.
- Total C and N: measured on oven-dried, ground soils with a TruSpec analyzer against reference standards.
- N mineralisation: follow Waring and Bremner (1964) protocol; NH4+ measured before and after anaerobic incubation (40 °C, 7 d) from 1:10 soil-to-solution extracts.
- Additional extractions: 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts for NH4+, NO3- (Miranda et al. 2001); CHCl3 fumigation-extraction for microbial biomass C and N (Voroney et al. 2008) with KEC/KEN corrections (0.35, 0.5).
- Phosphorus and cations: 1 M CH3COOH extractable PO43- and exchangeable Na, K, Ca measured; PO43- via Murphy and Riley (1962); cations via flame photometry (Sherwood 410).
- QA/assurance: all solutions analysed against matrix-matched certified references; procedural blanks where appropriate; data visually checked for quality assurance.

## Practical notes for Data Support
- The dataset provides a comprehensive soil property profile across two seasons to support analyses of soil health and its relation to greenhouse gas emission monitoring.
- Users should respect attribution requirements and note the depth/place-specific measurement conventions when integrating with other datasets.
- For data interpretation, refer to the cited methodological sources to understand potential measurement biases and correction factors.
