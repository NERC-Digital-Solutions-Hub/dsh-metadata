## Overview
- Field trial examining greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine patches on semi-improved upland grassland.
- Corresponds to above-ground biomass harvests within greenhouse gas chambers (dimensions: 50 cm x 50 cm).

## Location and Setup
- Site: orthic podzol at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales.
- Elevation: 270 m a.s.l. (53°13'N, 4°0'W).

## Experimental Design
- Treatments (n = 4): Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial sheep urine), RealUrine (real sheep urine).
- Design: randomised block.
- Applications: spring and autumn 2016.
- Biomass cuts: four times after spring applications; three times after autumn applications.

## Sampling and Processing
- Biomass samples stored in paper bags.
- Drying: oven-dried at 80 °C for 24 h.
- Grinding: samples ground in a ball mill.
- Analysis: measured with TruSpec® Analyzer (Leco Corp.) against certified standard reference materials.
- Data quality: visually checked for errors.

## Data Structure and Headers
- Sample_date: date of biomass sampling.
- Plot_no: chamber number from which biomass samples were taken.
- Treatment: Control, ArtUrine, RealUrine.
- Season: Spring or Autumn (season in which treatments were applied).
- Biomass: above-ground biomass in g dry weight per m².
- Foliar_N: nitrogen content of dried, ground biomass (%).
- Foliar_CtoN: carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of biomass samples.
