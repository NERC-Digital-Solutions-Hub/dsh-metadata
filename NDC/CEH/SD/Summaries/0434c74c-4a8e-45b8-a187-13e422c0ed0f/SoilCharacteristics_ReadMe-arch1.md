- Describes characteristics of Orthic Podzol at Henfaes Research Station (North Wales) used to monitor greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine applied to semi-improved pasture.
- Field details: 53°13'N, 4°0'W; ~270 m above sea level; 13% slope.

## Experimental design

- Two seasonal field trials conducted in 2016-2017 (spring and autumn).
- Four replicates taken from control plots within each spring and autumn experimental Plot.
- Focus on soil characteristics at the site prior to/alongside urine emission factors.

## Measurements and methods

- Bulk density (0-5 cm): measured with 100 cm3 metal rings; cores oven-dried (105 °C) and corrected for stone weight/volume.
- Gravimetric soil moisture: oven-dried (105 °C, 24 h).
- Organic matter: loss-on-ignition (Ball 1964 method).
- pH and electrical conductivity (EC): 1:2.5 soil-to-distilled water suspensions; calibrated with standard buffers.
- Total soil C and N and C:N ratio: measured on oven-dried, ground soil using TruSpec® (LECO) against reference materials.
- N mineralisation rate: following Waring & Bremner (1964); NH4+ measured pre- and post-anaerobic incubation (40 °C; 7 d) from 1:10 soil:solution extracts (1.0 M KCl,  soil-to-solution).
- Additional extractions: 0.5 M K2SO4 (1:5) for NH4+-N and NO3--N (via Miranda et al. 2001).
- CHCl3 fumigation-extraction: to determine extractable dissolved organic C, total dissolved N, microbial biomass C and N (with KEC = 0.35, KEN = 0.5).
- Final extraction: 1.0 M CH3COOH (1:5) to measure PO4--P and exchangeable cations (Na, K, Ca).
- Analyte standards and blanks: all solutions analyzed against matrix-matched certified standards; blanks where appropriate.
- Quality assurance: data visually checked for quality.
