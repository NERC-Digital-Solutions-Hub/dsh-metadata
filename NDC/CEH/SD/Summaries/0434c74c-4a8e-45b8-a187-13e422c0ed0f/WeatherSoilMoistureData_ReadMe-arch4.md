# ReadMe file for WeatherSoilMoistureData.csv

## Overview
- Data record rainfall, soil temperature at 5 cm depth, air temperature, and soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 5 cm and 10 cm depth.
- Collected at the Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
- Time period covers seasonal sheep urine application studies.

## Data provenance and collection
- Weather data gathered from a meteorological station installed at the experimental site (Skye Instruments Ltd., Llandrindod Wells, UK).
- Soil WFPS values derived from soil moisture probes (10HS Moisture Sensor, Decagon Devices Inc., WA, USA).
- Probes calibrated according to the manufacturers' instructions.

## Variables and headers (with units)
- TimeDate: date and time of measurements (format: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss)
- Rain_mm: rainfall in millimetres (mm)
- SoilTemp_5cm: soil temperature at 5 cm depth (°C)
- AirTemp: air temperature (°C)
- WFPS_5: soil water-filled pore space at 5 cm depth (%)
- WFPS_10: soil water-filled pore space at 10 cm depth (%)

## Data processing and quality
- WFPS values based on calibrated soil moisture probes; calibration performed per manufacturer guidelines to ensure accuracy.

## Usage notes
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Data reflect measurements during studies involving seasonal sheep urine applications; consider this context when interpreting temporal patterns.

## Attribution and context
- Data originate from Henfaes Research Station, with instrumentation and labelling tied to the specified equipment and site.
