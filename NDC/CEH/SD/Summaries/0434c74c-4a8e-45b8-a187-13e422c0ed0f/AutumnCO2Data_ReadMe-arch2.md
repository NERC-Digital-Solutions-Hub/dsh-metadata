CH4 emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol within a semiimproved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) in autumn, 2016

## Overview
- Study context: methane emissions measured from plots with three treatments (Control, artificial urine, real urine) on an orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland.
- Location and time: Henfaes Research Station, North Wales; autumn 2016.
- Experimental design: Randomised block design with plots monitored using automated GHG measurement.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Measurement system: Automated greenhouse gas monitoring system using LI-COR LI-820.
- Sampling cadence: Eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1-hour chamber closure; 4 gas samples analysed per closure).
- Calibration: Calibration standard analysed after every fourth gas sample entering the gas chromatograph.
- Chamber details: Base area 0.25 m²; chambers 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (L × W × H).
- Emission scope: Data describe emissions captured during the automated high-frequency period; not raw gas concentration data.

## Treatments and plot design
- Treatments: Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real sheep urine).
- Plot context: Randomised block experimental design on orthic podzol within semi-improved upland grassland.

## Data content and structure
- Data coverage: High-frequency flux data from the automated system during autumn 2016.
- Data quality: Flux data have undergone quality assurance; raw GC chromatograms and files inspected for anomalies and necessary removals.
- Data headers: Timestamp format is dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Flux columns: Columns B to M represent CO2 fluxes, all in mg CO2-C m-2 h-1.
- Coding: Treatment and chamber/plot identifiers included in headers (Control, ArtUrine, Urine).

## Data quality assurance and limitations
- QA procedures: Visual inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; anomalies removed as needed.
- Output type: Provided dataset comprises quality-assured flux data, not raw gas concentration data.
- Limitation note: Focused on CO2 flux outputs within a methane-emission study context; one seasonal snapshot (autumn 2016) within a specific location and plot configuration.
