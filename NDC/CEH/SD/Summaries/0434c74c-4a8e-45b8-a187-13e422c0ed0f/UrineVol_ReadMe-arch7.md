# UrineVol.csv

## Overview
- Displays volume of individual urine events collected from Welsh Mountain ewes (n = 6) during spring 2016 and autumn 2016 urine collection trials.
- Trials conducted at the middle ffridd, Henfaes research station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales.
- Data used to determine the mean urine volume to apply to greenhouse gas chambers to represent a typical sheep urination event.

## Data content
- Volume_SP: Volume of each individual urine event (ml) collected in spring 2016.
- Volume_AT: Volume of each individual urine event (ml) collected in autumn 2016.
- Both columns reflect values corrected for losses within the urine collection apparatus.
- Trials are tied to a specific location and time (spring and autumn 2016 at Henfaes, North Wales).

## Data fields
- Volume_SP: Spring 2016 urine event volume (ml) per event.
- Volume_AT: Autumn 2016 urine event volume (ml) per event.
- Corrections noted for apparatus-related losses.

## Data quality and provenance
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Data derived from six sheep across two seasonal trials; small sample size.
- Data have been corrected for losses in the collection apparatus, improving accuracy for per-event volumes.

## Geospatial and GIS considerations
- Data are per-event volumes and tied to a single geographic site, suitable for:
  - Mapping the distribution of urine-event volumes by season at the trial location (if time/sequence data are available).
  - Integrating with broader datasets to model or parameterize environmental inputs (e.g., methane release models) at a defined site.
- Limited spatial scope; replication or additional locations would enhance spatial analysis potential.

## Usage notes and limitations
- Intended to inform mean urine volume used in greenhouse gas chamber modeling for a representative sheep urination event.
- Small sample size and single-site context limit generalizability.
- Proper attribution required when reusing or reproducing the data.

## Provenance and attribution
- Data collected at Henfaes research station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales.
- Clear acknowledgment required for any reuse of the data.
