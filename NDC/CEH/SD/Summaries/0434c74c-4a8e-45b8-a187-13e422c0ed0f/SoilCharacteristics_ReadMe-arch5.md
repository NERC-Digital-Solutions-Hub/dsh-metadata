- Purpose and scope
  - Describes characteristics of the Orthic Podzol soil, sampled at two times (spring and autumn) during 2016–2017 field trials to monitor greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine applied to a semi-improved pasture.
  - Field site: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (53°13'N, 4°0'W), 270 m a.s.l., slope 13%.

- Experimental design
  - Four replicates from control plots within spring and autumn experimental plots.
  - Seasonal measurements corresponding to spring and autumn trials.

- Measured soil properties and measurement methods
  - Physical and chemical soil properties measured, including:
    - Bulk density (BD_SP, BD_AT) 0–5 cm; corrected for stone weight/volume.
    - Gravimetric moisture (Gravmoist_SP, Gravmoist_AT) 0–10 cm; on a dry weight basis.
    - Organic matter (Orgmat_SP, Orgmat_AT) as a percentage of dry soil weight.
    - pH (pH_SP, pH_AT) and electrical conductivity (EC_SP, EC_AT) on 1:2.5 soil-to-water suspensions.
    - Total carbon (C_SP, C_AT) and total nitrogen (N_SP, N_AT) on a dry weight basis (0–10 cm).
    - Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (CN_SP, CN_AT) (0–10 cm).
    - Nitrogen mineralisation rate (Nmin_SP, Nmin_AT) (mg N kg-1 day-1) (0–10 cm).
    - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC_SP, DOC_AT) (0.5 M K2SO4 extracts).
    - Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN_SP, TDN_AT) (0.5 M K2SO4 extracts).
    - Nitrate (Nitrate_SP, Nitrate_AT) (0.5 M K2SO4 extracts).
    - Ammonium (Ammon_SP, Ammon_AT) (0.5 M K2SO4 extracts).
    - Phosphate (Phosph_SP, Phosph_AT) (1 M acetic acid extracts).
    - Exchangeable cations: Na_SP/Na_AT, K_SP/K_AT, Ca_SP/Ca_AT (1 M acetic acid extracts).
  - Analytical methods and standards referenced, including Ball (1964) for loss-on-ignition, Mulvaney (1996) for ammonium/N forms, Murphy and Riley (1962) for phosphate, Voroney et al. (2008) for microbial biomass, Waring and Bremner (1964) for N mineralisation, and instrumentation such as TruSpec® Analyzer and flame photometer.
  - All solutions analysed against matrix-matched certified reference standards; procedural blanks used where appropriate.
  - Data checked visually for quality assurance.

- Data structure and metadata
  - Key headers with definitions:
    - BD_SP, BD_AT; Gravmoist_SP, Gravmoist_AT; Orgmat_SP, Orgmat_AT; pH_SP, pH_AT; EC_SP, EC_AT; C_SP, C_AT; N_SP, N_AT; CN_SP, CN_AT; Nmin_SP, Nmin_AT; DOC_SP, DOC_AT; TDN_SP, TDN_AT; Nitrate_SP, Nitrate_AT; Ammon_SP, Ammon_AT; Phosph_SP, Phosph_AT; Na_SP, Na_AT; K_SP, K_AT; Ca_SP, Ca_AT.
