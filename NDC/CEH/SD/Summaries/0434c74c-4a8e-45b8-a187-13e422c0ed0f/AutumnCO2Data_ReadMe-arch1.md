# CH4 emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol within a semiimproved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) in autumn, 2016

## Overview
- Dataset describes CH4 emissions measured from plots with three treatments: Control (no urine), artificial urine (ArtUrine), and real sheep urine (Urine) applied to an orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland.
- Study location and timing: Henfaes Research Station, North Wales, autumn 2016.
- Experimental design: Randomised block design.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (LI-COR LI-820) used.
- Eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1-hour chamber closure; 4 gas samples per closure).
- Calibration standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample.
- Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m²; dimensions 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (L × W × H).

## Data content and structure
- Data represent quality-assessed flux measurements (not raw gas concentrations) during the period analyzed by the automated system.
- Data headers:
  - Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
  - Columns B–M: CO2 fluxes (in mg CO2-C m⁻² h⁻¹)
- Treatment and chamber/plot identifiers are encoded in the column headers:
  - Control = control treatment
  - ArtUrine = artificial urine treatment
  - Urine = real urine treatment

## Quality assurance and processing
- Quality assurance involved inspecting raw data files and gas chromatograms for anomalies and removing problematic data (e.g., gas-peak interferences).

## Context and notes for analysis
- The dataset focuses on flux measurements derived from an automated system, emphasizing quality-checked CO2 flux data rather than raw gas concentrations.
- Although the study description centers on CH4 emissions, the available data excerpt presents CO2 flux measurements; users should align interpretations accordingly and verify whether CH4 data are available separately.
