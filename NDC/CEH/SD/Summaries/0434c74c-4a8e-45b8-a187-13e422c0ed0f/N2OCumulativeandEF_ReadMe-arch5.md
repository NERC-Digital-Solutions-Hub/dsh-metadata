# ReadMe file for N2OCumulativeandEF.csv

## Overview
- Documents annual cumulative N2O emissions and N2O-N emission factors for control (no urine), artificial sheep urine, and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
- Study conducted in spring and autumn 2016 using a randomised block design.
- Emissions calculated as area under the chamber emission curves; emission factors adjusted for the patch area not covered by urine in the chamber.

## Data collected
- Spring 2016: artificial urine N application rate 1066 kg N ha-1; real sheep urine 756 kg N ha-1.
- Autumn 2016: artificial urine N application rate 1004 kg N ha-1; real sheep urine 1112 kg N ha-1.
- Cumulative N2O emissions and corresponding emission factors (as % of urine-N applied) are reported per chamber and season.

## Data files and structure
- Primary dataset: N2OCumulativeandEF.csv
- Related datasets for context and methods: AutumnN2OData.csv and SpringN2OData.csv (data collection and instrumentation details)

## Variables and units
- Treatment: Control, ArtUrine, RealUrine
- Chamber_no: Chamber identifier
- Season: Spring 2016 or Autumn 2016
- Cumulative_N2O: Cumulative N2O emissions per chamber over 1 year (micrograms N2O-N)
- N2O-N_EF: N2O-N emission factor as a percentage of total N applied

## Calculations and methods
- Cumulative emissions derived from the area under the N2O emission curve for each replicate chamber per season.
- Emission factors calculated after correcting for the chamber area not exposed to urine due to discrete patch applications.
- Data visually checked for errors.

## Data quality and governance notes
- Metadata should confirm: patch size for urine application, chamber dimensions, and instrumentation details (linked to Spring/Autumn data files).
- Ensure proper data provenance, units, and methodological notes align with standard metadata templates.
- Authorship acknowledgment is required for data reuse or reproduction.

## Usage notes
- Authors must be acknowledged if the data are reused or reproduced.
