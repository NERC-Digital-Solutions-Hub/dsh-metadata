# ReadMe file for SpringCH4Data.csv

## Overview
- CH4 emissions data from treatments: Control (no urine), artificial urine, and real urine applied to an orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales.
- Study site and timing: spring 2016, 270 m above sea level, 53°13'N, 4°0'W.
- Experimental design: randomised block with plots.
- Data collection cadence: eight flux measurements per chamber per day; 1-hour chamber closure per measurement; four gas samples analyzed per closure; calibration after every fourth sample.

## Data Collection and Design
- Measurement system: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system; SRI 8610 GC used for analysis.
- Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (L × W × H).
- Data produced: quality-assessed CH4 flux data (not raw gas concentrations).

## Measurements and QA
- Quality assurance: review of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removal of data where issues are detected (e.g., gas peak interference).
- Calibration: standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample.
- Data headers: Timestamp format is dd/mm/yy hh:mm; Columns B–M contain CH4 fluxes in mg CH4-C m-2 h-1; headers indicate treatment (Control, ArtUrine, Urine) and chamber/plot identifiers.

## Data Structure and Metadata
- Flux units: mg CH4-C m-2 h-1.
- Columns B–M encode treatment and chamber/plot numbers.
- Data provenance includes site location, elevation (270 m a.s.l.), and precise coordinates; collected in spring 2016.
- Data are the processed, quality-assessed flux values, not the raw gas concentrations.

## Data Usage and Attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Location and Timing
- Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (53°13'N, 4°0'W; 270 m a.s.l.).
- Spring 2016 data collection period.

## Data Governance and Availability
- Data can be shared with attribution; underlying raw data are not provided in this readme; guidance emphasizes data provenance and processing steps from raw measurements to flux data.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- Illustrates robust monitoring practices: randomised block design, standardized flux measurement cadence, explicit QA procedures, and transparent metadata.
- Supports monitoring of methane flux responses to livestock urine treatments, informing environmental policy and mitigation assessments.
- Highlights governance considerations for monitoring datasets: traceability from raw measurements to processed outputs, explicit data quality checks, and attribution requirements.
