# UrineVol.csv

## Aim and Use
- Documented volumes of individual urine events from Welsh Mountain ewes (n = 6) collected during spring 2016 and autumn 2016.
- Data used to determine the mean urine volume to apply in greenhouse gas chamber modelling, representing a typical sheep urination event.

## Collection Context
- Trials conducted at middle ffridd, Henfaes research station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales.
- Timeframe: spring 2016 and autumn 2016.

## Data Structure and Key Fields
- Volume_SP: Volume of each individual sheep urine event (ml) collected in spring 2016; values corrected for loss within the urine collection apparatus.
- Volume_AT: Volume of each individual sheep urine event (ml) collected in autumn 2016; values corrected for loss within the urine collection apparatus.

## Metadata and Attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Data Quality, Standardisation, and Management
- Corrected for apparatus loss, indicating calibration/quality assurance steps.
- Sample size is small (n = 6), which may impact representativeness and generalisation.

## Data Access and Reuse Considerations
- Datasets are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
- Potential for combining with other data to increase value and for enabling access to underlying data used to generate final outputs.
