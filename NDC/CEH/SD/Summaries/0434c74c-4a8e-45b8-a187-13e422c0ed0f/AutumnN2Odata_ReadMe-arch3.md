# N2O emissions from control, artificial urine, and real urine treatments in upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales (Autumn 2016)

## Overview
- Provides quality-assessed N2O emission data from an experimental grassland site using three treatments: Control, artificial urine, and real urine.
- Data purpose: support monitoring, evaluation, and informing future environmental policy and decision-making.

## Experimental design and site
- Location: orthic podzol within semi-improved upland grassland, Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales; 270 m above sea level; 53°13'N, 4°0'W.
- Experimental design: randomised block.
- Treatments: Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real sheep urine).
- Core measurements taken on plots arranged for high-frequency monitoring, with supporting monthly manual measurements.

## Data collection and measurement methods
- Automated gas monitoring: eight N2O flux measurements per chamber per day; 1-hour chamber closure; four gas samples per closure; calibration standard after every fourth sample.
- Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m²; chambers 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm.
- Manual measurements: monthly flux measurements from smaller chambers (40 cm × 20 cm × 20 cm); analyzed with Perkin Elmer 580 GC and Turbo Matrix 110 auto sampler.
- Calibration: four gas standards spanning measured concentration ranges (BOC gases, Liverpool).
- Data scope: includes high-frequency automated data and subsequent monthly manual data; data structure reflects two collection phases.
- Data output: flux data (not raw gas concentrations); units are micrograms N2O-N m⁻² h⁻¹.

## Data processing and quality assurance
- Quality assurance: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; anomalies removed as needed (e.g., gas peak interference).
- Handling of detection limits: manual data fluxes below detection limits set to zero.
- Data headers: Date_Time (dd/mm/yy hh:mm); columns B–M contain N2O fluxes with treatments and chamber/plot identifiers (Control, ArtUrine, Urine).

## Data structure and metadata
- Data present as structured flux measurements with clear treatment labels and chamber/plot identifiers.
- High-frequency automated measurements paired with lower-frequency manual measurements, with explicit indication of two data collection phases.

## Data governance, sharing, and provenance
- Photographs of data governance aren’t provided; however, reuse requires acknowledgment of authors.
- Data are intended to be shared, but sharing can be impeded by metadata gaps or restrictions around open data from original sources.
- Data management aims: ensure quality, transparency, and accessibility, with clear metadata and documentation of data origins, processing steps, and QA procedures.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks (archetype considerations)
- Demonstrates a structured approach to selecting meaningful environmental health measures (N2O flux) across treatments to inform policy decisions.
- Highlights importance of high-frequency data integration with periodic manual measurements for robust monitoring.
- Emphasizes data governance steps: documentation, data sharing, metadata quality, and public availability considerations.
- Illustrates challenges common to monitoring frameworks: data availability, metadata completeness, data siloing, and barriers to sharing; underscores need for standardized data formats and transparent QA.

## Key challenges and considerations for implementation
- Data availability and access delays can hinder timely decision-making.
- Silos within/between organisations can impede data integration.
- Public sharing requirements may limit use of some data sources.
- Inadequate metadata and format-related transformation effort can hinder data usability.
- Establishing and maintaining data governance processes to ensure up-to-date, standardized, and accessible datasets.
