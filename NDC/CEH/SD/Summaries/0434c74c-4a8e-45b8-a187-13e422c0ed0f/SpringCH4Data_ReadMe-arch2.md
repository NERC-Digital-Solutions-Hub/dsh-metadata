# ReadMe file for SpringCH4Data.csv

## Overview
- CH4 emissions data collected from control (no urine), artificial urine, and real sheep urine treatments.
- Experimental setup: orthic podzol within a semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales; spring 2016.
- Design: randomised block experiment with plots assigned to one of three treatments.

## Location and Experimental Design
- Site: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
- Soil/land cover: orthic podzol on semi-improved upland grassland.
- Experimental design: randomised block.

## Measurement System and Data Collection
- Instrumentation: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (affiliated with Queensland University of Technology, Institute for Future Environments) using an SRI 8610 GC.
- Flux measurements: eight CH4 flux measurements per chamber per day.
  - Each measurement involves 1 hour chamber closure and four gas samples analyzed per closure.
  - Calibration standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample.
- Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (l x w x h).

## Data Content and Quality
- Data represent quality-assessed CH4 flux data (not raw gas concentration data).
- Quality assurance: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; anomalous data removed as necessary (e.g., due to gas peak interference).

## Data Headers and Treatments
- Timestamp format: dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Data columns: Columns B to M contain CH4 fluxes in mg CH4-C m-2 h-1.
- Metadata in headers: treatment type and chamber/plot numbers.
  - Treatments: Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real urine).

## Provenance, Use, and Access
- Authorship: authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Data scope: spring 2016 measurements from the Henfaes site.
- Reuse considerations: data are prepared for standardised analyses and potential combination with other datasets; underlying data should remain accessible where possible, and should be uploaded to appropriate portals.
