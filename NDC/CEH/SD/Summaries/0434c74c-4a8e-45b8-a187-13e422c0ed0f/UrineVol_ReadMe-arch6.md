# UrineVol.csv

## Overview
- Dataset of individual urine event volumes from Welsh Mountain ewes (n = 6).
- Collected during spring 2016 and autumn 2016 urine trials.
- Purpose: base the mean urine volume to apply to greenhouse gas chambers, representing a typical sheep urination event.

## Data collection context
- Location: middle ffridd, Henfaes research station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales.
- Trials: spring 2016 and autumn 2016.
- Per-event data allow estimation of typical volume across seasons.

## Key variables
- Volume_SP: Volume (ml) of each individual urine event in spring 2016; values corrected for loss within the urine collection apparatus.
- Volume_AT: Volume (ml) of each individual urine event in autumn 2016; values corrected for loss within the urine collection apparatus.

## Data quality and provenance
- Values corrected for apparatus losses to improve accuracy.
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Usage and applications
- Enables calculation of mean urine volume for modelling greenhouse gas chamber inputs.
- Supports a self-serve approach to understanding typical urination event volumes across seasons.

## Notes
- Data are per-event measurements (not aggregated), suitable for deriving summary statistics or distribution analyses.
