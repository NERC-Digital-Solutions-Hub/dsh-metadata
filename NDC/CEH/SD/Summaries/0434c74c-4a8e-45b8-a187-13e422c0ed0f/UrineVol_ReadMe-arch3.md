# UrineVol.csv

- Purpose: Dataset of individual urine event volumes used to determine a mean urine volume for application in greenhouse gas chamber experiments, ensuring the simulated urination event is representative for grazing sheep.

- Study and location details:
  - Subjects: Welsh Mountain ewes (n = 6)
  - Trials: Spring 2016 and Autumn 2016 urine collection
  - Location: Middle Ffridd, Henfaes research station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales

- Data content:
  - Volume_SP: Volume (ml) of each individual urine event collected in Spring 2016
  - Volume_AT: Volume (ml) of each individual urine event collected in Autumn 2016
  - Both variables are corrected for urine collection apparatus losses

- Data provenance and authorship:
  - Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced

- Data quality and processing:
  - Volumes are corrected for losses within the collection apparatus
  - Units are milliliters (ml)
  - Metadata describes the corrections and collection context

- Application and use:
  - Used to basis the mean urine volume for calibrating greenhouse gas chambers to reflect a typical sheep urination event

- Re-use considerations:
  - Ensure proper attribution of authors
  - Consider the limited sample size (n = 6 animals) and context (specific location and trials) when generalizing findings
