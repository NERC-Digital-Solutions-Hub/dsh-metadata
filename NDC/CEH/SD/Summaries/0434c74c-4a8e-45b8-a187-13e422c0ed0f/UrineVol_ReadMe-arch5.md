# UrineVol.csv

## Overview
- Dataset capturing volumes of individual urine events from Welsh Mountain ewes (n = 6).
- Data collected during urine collection trials in spring 2016 and autumn 2016.
- Location: middle ffridd, Henfaes research station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales.
- Purpose: to derive the mean urine volume to apply to greenhouse gas chambers, representing a typical sheep urination event.
- File format: CSV; data points represent individual urine events; volumes measured in millilitres (ml).

## Dataset structure and key variables
- Volume_SP: Volume of each individual sheep urine event (ml) collected in spring 2016; values corrected for losses within the urine collection apparatus.
- Volume_AT: Volume of each individual sheep urine event (ml) collected in autumn 2016; values corrected for losses within the urine collection apparatus.

## Provenance and authorship
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are re-used or reproduced.

## Data collection context
- Trials conducted at Henfaes research station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales.
- Spring 2016 and autumn 2016 collection periods.
- Data used to establish a representative urine volume for modeling in greenhouse gas chamber studies.

## Governance, reuse, and limitations
- Authorship acknowledgment required for any reuse or reproduction.
- Data corrections applied to account for losses in the collection apparatus.
- Limitations to consider: small sample size (n = 6), single geographic location, and two collection periods (may limit generalizability).

## Stewardship recommendations
- Ensure metadata is complete and standardized (title, description, variables, units, location, collection periods, processing steps).
- Document data lineage, including how Volume_SP and Volume_AT were corrected for apparatus losses.
- Include clear guidance on authorship acknowledgement in any reuse.
- Maintain and publish updates if new collection data become available.
- Ensure dataset is discoverable in relevant data portals and linked to related datasets or studies (e.g., greenhouse gas modeling contexts).
