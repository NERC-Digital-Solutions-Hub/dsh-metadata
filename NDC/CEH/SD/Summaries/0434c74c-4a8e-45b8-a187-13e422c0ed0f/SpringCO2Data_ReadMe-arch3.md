# ReadMe file for SpringCO2Data.csv

- Purpose: Documentation for a CO2 emissions dataset collected from an experimental field trial comparing control, artificial urine, and real urine treatments on an orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales, during spring 2016. The study used a randomised block experimental design to assess treatment effects on CO2 fluxes.

- Data provenance and authorship:
  - Data come from automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (LI-COR LI-820) operated by Queensland University of Technology.
  - Authors must be acknowledged if the data are reused or reproduced.

- Experimental context and site details:
  - Location: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
  - Soil/management: orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland.
  - Experimental design: randomised block.
  - Chamber specifications: 0.25 m2 basal area; chambers 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H).

- Data collection and instrumentation:
  - Monitoring system: automated GHG monitoring system.
  - Measurements: eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1 h chamber closure; 4 gas samples analyzed per 1 h closure).
  - Calibration: calibration standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample into the gas chromatograph.
  - Output type: quality-assessed flux data (not raw gas concentrations).

- Data quality and processing:
  - QA procedures: inspection of raw data files and chromatograms for anomalies; removal of anomalies when necessary (e.g., gas peak interference).
  - Representation: data represent QA-processed flux values for CO2.

- Data structure and content:
  - Timestamp format: dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
  - Data columns: Columns B to M contain CO2 fluxes (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1).
  - Metadata in headers: treatment type (Control, ArtUrine, Urine) and chamber/plot identifiers.

- Usage notes and limitations:
  - Data are quality-assessed flux values, not raw concentration data.
  - For reuse, appropriate acknowledgment required.
  - Data may require understanding of the treatment design (Control, artificial urine, real urine) and chamber/block layout for proper interpretation.
