# ReadMe file for SpringCH4Data.csv

## Overview
- CH4 emissions data measured under three treatments: Control (no urine), artificial urine (ArtUrine), and real sheep urine (Urine).
- Collected from an orthic podzol within a semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales.

## Study site and timing
- Location: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
- Environment: semi-improved upland grassland; orthic podzol.
- Time: Spring 2016.

## Experimental design
- Randomised block experimental design.
- Chambers used for flux measurements.

## Measurements and instrumentation
- Instrumentation: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (Queensland University of Technology, Institute for Future Environments) with a SRI 8610 GC.
- Sampling protocol: eight flux measurements per chamber per day; 1-hour chamber closure; four gas samples analyzed per 1-hour closure.
- Calibration: calibration standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample.

## Chambers and data scope
- Chamber basal area: 0.25 m2.
- Chamber dimensions: 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H).
- Data provided: quality-assessed CH4 flux data (not raw gas concentrations).

## Data quality and QA
- QA procedures included inspecting raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies.
- Anomalies removed as necessary (e.g., interference in gas peaks).

## Data structure and metadata
- Timestamp format: dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- CH4 flux columns: Columns B to M represent CH4 fluxes (mg CH4-C m-2 h-1).
- Column headers encode treatment and chamber/plot numbers:
  - Control = control treatment
  - ArtUrine = artificial urine treatment
  - Urine = real urine treatment
