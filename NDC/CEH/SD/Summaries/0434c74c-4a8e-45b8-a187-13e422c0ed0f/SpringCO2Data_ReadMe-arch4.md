# ReadMe file for SpringCO2Data.csv

## Overview
- Dataset describes CO2 emissions measured from soil under three treatments: Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial urine), and Urine (real urine).
- Experimental site: orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland, Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W), spring 2016.
- Experimental design: randomised block.
- Data represent quality-assessed flux measurements, not raw gas concentrations.

## Experimental Design and Location
- Location and timing: Henfaes Research Station, North Wales, spring 2016.
- Soil and vegetation context: orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland.
- Design: randomised block experiment.
- Chamber area: 0.25 m2 per chamber; chamber dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (l x w x h).
- Treatments: Control, ArtUrine, Urine.

## Instrumentation and Measurement Protocol
- Gas flux monitoring system: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (LI-COR LI-820) operated with data from a LI-COR gas chromatograph (GC).
- Sampling cadence: eight flux measurements per chamber per day.
- Chamber closure: 1 hour per measurement (1 h closure period).
- Gas sampling: four gas samples analyzed per 1-hour closure period.
- Calibration: calibration standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample into GC.

## Data Content and Structure
- Data type: quality-assessed CO2 flux data (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1); not raw gas concentration data.
- Headers: Timestamp format is dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Columns: Columns B to M contain CO2 flux values (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1).
- Treatment/plot metadata embedded in headers: labels include Control, ArtUrine, and Urine alongside chamber/plot identifiers.

## Data Quality Assurance and Processing
- QA steps: inspection of raw data files and chromatograms for anomalies; removal of anomalies as necessary (e.g., gas peak interference).
- Data provenance emphasis: data provided are the flux measurements after quality checks.

## Metadata and Documentation Notes
- Data provenance and treatment definitions are described to support correct interpretation and re-use.
- Proper acknowledgment required: Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Usage Considerations and Licensing
- Data are suitable for analyzing the effect of urine treatments on soil CO2 flux within the specified experimental design.
- As per the ReadMe, authorship acknowledgment is required for reuse; no explicit licensing details provided beyond acknowledgment requirement.
- Users should reference the data source and ensure alignment with the randomised block design when conducting analyses.
