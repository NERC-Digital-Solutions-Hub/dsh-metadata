# CH4 emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol within a semiimproved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) in autumn, 2016.

## Overview
- Dataset describing methane emissions from plots receiving control, artificial urine, and real urine treatments.
- Collected in autumn 2016 at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales (upland grassland on orthic podzol).

## Experimental design
- Randomised block experimental design.
- Treatments: Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real sheep urine).
- Plots designed to assess effects of urine treatments on gas fluxes.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (GHG) operated at the site.
- Instrumentation: LI-COR LI-820 connected to GHG system.
- Flux measurements: eight measurements per chamber per day during 1-hour closure periods; 4 gas samples analysed per closure.
- Calibration: calibration standard analysed after every fourth gas sample.

## Chamber and sampling details
- Chamber basal area: 0.25 m².
- Chamber dimensions: 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (L × W × H).
- Location and timing: autumn 2016, upland grassland at ~270 m a.s.l.

## Data content and headers
- Data represent quality-assessed flux data (not raw gas concentration data).
- Data focus: emissions derived from the automated system during high-frequency sampling.
- Data headers:
  - Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
  - Columns B to M: CO2 fluxes (mg CO2-C m⁻² h⁻¹)
  - Treatments indicated in headers: Control (Control), ArtUrine (artificial urine treatment), Urine (real urine treatment)

## Quality assurance and data processing
- Quality assurance: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; inappropriate data removed (e.g., gas peak interferences).
- Data quality emphasis: emission flux data filtered for anomalies rather than retaining raw concentrations.

## Data usage notes and caveats for Data Support
- Outputs provided are flux data with CO2 units; if used for CH4 analyses, ensure appropriate conversion or labeling as CH4-related context may vary.
- Data are high-frequency flux measurements; users should account for potential temporal autocorrelation in analyses.
- Data available as processed flux values, not raw concentration data; supplemental QA details are important for re-use.

## Practical guidance for data users
- Confirm treatment mapping in headers to accurately align flux data with the respective control, artificial urine, and real urine plots.
- Use provided timestamps to aggregate fluxes (e.g., daily or hourly analyses) while considering the 1-hour chamber closures.
- Leverage quality assurance notes to filter out any suspicious periods or anomalous chromatograms before interpretation.
