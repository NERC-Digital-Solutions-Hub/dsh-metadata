# N2O emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol within a semiimproved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) in autumn, 2016

## Overview
- Dataset description: N2O emissions measured from plots with three treatments (Control, artificial urine, real urine) in a randomised block experimental design.
- Study site and period: orthic podzol soil, semi-improved upland grassland, Henfaes Research Station, North Wales; autumn 2016.
- Data purpose: provide quality-assessed greenhouse gas flux measurements for environmental monitoring and policy-relevant analysis.

## Experimental design and data collection
- Design: randomised block with distinct treatments (Control, ArtUrine, Urine).
- Flux measurement regimes:
  - Automated high-frequency measurements: eight flux measurements per chamber per day, using 1-hour chamber closures and four gas samples per closure.
  - Manual monthly measurements: from smaller chambers (40 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm) after the automated period.
- Chamber dimensions:
  - Automated system chambers: base area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H).
  - Manual system chambers: 40 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm (L x W x H).
- Data period coverage: high-frequency automated time-series data followed by monthly manual flux data.

## Measurement instruments and procedures
- Automated flux data:
  - Instrument: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (QUT, Australia) with a SRI 8610 GC.
  - Output: eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1-hour closure; four gas samples per closure).
  - Calibration: standard calibration after every fourth sampled gas.
- Manual flux data:
  - Instrument: Perkin Elmer 580 Gas Chromatograph with Turbo Matrix 110 auto-sampler.
  - Calibrations: four gas standards spanning measured concentration ranges (BOC gases, Liverpool).
- Data type:
  - Processed flux data (not raw gas concentrations); represents quality-assessed flux values.

## Data structure and quality assurance
- Data headers:
  - Date_Time: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
  - Columns B to M: N2O fluxes (in micrograms N2O-N m-2 h-1)
  - Treatments encoded in headers: Control, ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real urine)
- Quality assurance:
  - Inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms to identify and remove anomalies.
  - Flux values below detection limits in manual samples replaced with zero.
- Data provenance:
  - Authors must be acknowledged if data are re-used or reproduced.

## Data integration and accessibility considerations
- Outputs are standardized, facilitating cross-dataset comparisons and time-series analyses for environmental monitoring.
- The dataset provides both high-frequency automated flux data and lower-frequency manual measurements, enabling cross-validation and method comparisons.
- To align with monitoring objectives, underlying data sources and processing steps are explicitly documented (quality checks, detection-limit handling), supporting reproducibility and potential data sharing via appropriate portals.
