# N2O emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial and real sheep urine applied to an orthic podzol within a semiimproved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) in autumn, 2016

- Overview
  - Dataset of N2O emissions from three treatments: Control, artificial urine (ArtUrine), and real urine (Urine) applied to orthic podzol in semiimproved upland grassland.
  - Experimental design: randomised block.
  - Location and time details provided for provenance and context.

- Data collection and measurement regimes
  - High-frequency measurements (automated system)
    - Eight flux measurements per chamber per day.
    - 1-hour chamber closure period; four gas samples analysed per closure.
    - Calibration standard analysed after every fourth gas sample.
    - Chamber size: 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm; basal area 0.25 m2.
  - Low-frequency measurements (manual)
    - Monthly flux measurements from smaller chambers.
    - Chamber size: 40 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm.
    - Analyzed with a Perkin Elmer 580 GC and Turbo Matrix 110 autosampler.
    - Calibrated with four gas standards (BOC gases, Liverpool).

- Data content and structure
  - Data represent quality-assessed N2O flux data, not raw gas concentrations.
  - Headers: Date_Time formatted as dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
  - Columns B to M contain N2O fluxes (micrograms N2O-N m-2 h-1).
  - Treatment and chamber/plot identifiers encoded in column headers (Control, ArtUrine, Urine).

- Quality assurance and data processing
  - QA steps include inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; anomalies removed as needed (e.g., peak interference).
  - For manual measurements, fluxes below detection limit replaced with zero.

- Data provenance and usage notes
  - Data originate from an automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (QUT) and a manual GC system (Perkin Elmer).
  - Authors must be acknowledged when data are reused or reproduced.
  - Outputs reflect processed, publishable flux data intended to enable downstream analysis and interpretation; users may need to align high-frequency and monthly data streams if combining across regimes.
