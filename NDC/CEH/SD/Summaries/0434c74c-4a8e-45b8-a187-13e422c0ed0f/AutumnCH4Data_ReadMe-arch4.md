# CH4 emissions measured from control (no urine), artificial urine, and real urine applied to orthic podzol within semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (autumn 2016)

## Study context
- Location: semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
- Timeframe: autumn 2016.
- Experimental setup: randomised block design assessing emissions under three treatments.

## Treatments and experimental design
- Treatments: Control (no urine), ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real sheep urine).
- Plot structure: chamber-based measurements with defined plot/chamber numbering; treatments linked to specific chambers/plots.
- Purpose: quantify CH4 flux differences due to urine addition types.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Instrumentation: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system with a SRI 8610 GC.
- Measurement cadence: eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1-hour chamber closure; four gas samples analyzed per closure).
- Calibration: standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample.
- Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m²; dimensions 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (L × W × H).

## Data content and format
- Data type: quality-assessed CH4 flux data (not raw gas concentration data).
- Period: high-frequency data captured during the automated measurement period.
- Timestamp format: dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Data columns: Columns B to M contain CH4 flux values (mg CH4-C m⁻² h⁻¹).
- Headers encode treatment and chamber/plot identifiers; treatment codes include Control, ArtUrine, and Urine.

## Data quality, provenance, and curation
- Data quality: underwent QA by inspecting raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; anomalous records removed as needed (e.g., peak interference).
- Provenance: authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Metadata and usage notes
- Data represent processed CH4 flux measurements rather than raw gas concentrations.
- Location and sampling details (coordinates, altitude, date, experimental design) support context and reuse considerations.
- Clear treatment labeling and structured headers facilitate data discoverability and integration with related datasets.
