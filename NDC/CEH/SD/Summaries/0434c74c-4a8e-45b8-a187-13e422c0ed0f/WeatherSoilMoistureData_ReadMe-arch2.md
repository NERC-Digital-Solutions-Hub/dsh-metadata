# ReadMe file for WeatherSoilMoistureData.csv

- Purpose: Provide weather and soil moisture data from the experimental study site for environmental monitoring and analysis, covering seasonal sheep urine application studies.
- Variables included:
  - Rain_mm: rainfall in millimetres
  - SoilTemp_5cm: soil temperature in °C at 5 cm depth
  - AirTemp: air temperature in °C
  - WFPS_5: soil water-filled pore space (%-volume) at 5 cm depth
  - WFPS_10: soil water-filled pore space (%-volume) at 10 cm depth
  - TimeDate: date and time of measurements (format dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss)

## Data collection and sources

- Meteorological data collected from a station installed at the site by Skye Instruments Ltd. (Llandrindod Wells, UK).
- Soil moisture (WFPS) calculated from 10HS Moisture Sensor probes (Decagon Devices Inc., USA) and calibrated according to manufacturer instructions.

## Location and site details

- Site: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales
- Elevation: 270 m above sea level
- Coordinates: 53°13'N, 4°0'W

## Data processing and quality

- Data are derived from sensor measurements; soil moisture values are calculated from calibrated probes.
- Data authorship should be acknowledged if the data are reused or reproduced.

## Usage, attribution, and accessibility

- Data intended to support monitoring and analysis of environmental conditions and policy-relevant environmental health over time.
- When reusing, acknowledge the original authors as specified in the dataset documentation.
- Formats and headers are standardized for integration with other environmental datasets, facilitating cross-dataset analysis and wider accessibility.
