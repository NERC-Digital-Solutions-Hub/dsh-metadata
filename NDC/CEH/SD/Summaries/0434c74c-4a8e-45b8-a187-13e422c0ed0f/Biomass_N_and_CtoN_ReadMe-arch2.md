# ReadMe file for Biomass_N_and_CtoN.csv

- Aim
  - Documents the above-ground biomass harvests from a field trial investigating greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine patches applied to semi-improved upland grassland, with biomass data collected from within greenhouse gas chambers (dimensions: 50 cm × 50 cm).

- Location and experimental design
  - Field trial established on an orthic podzol at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
  - Treatments (n = 4): Control (no urine), Artificial sheep urine (ArtUrine), Real sheep urine (RealUrine).
  - Design: randomised block design.
  - Treatments applied in spring and autumn 2016.

- Sampling and biomass processing
  - Biomass cuts: four times following spring applications, three times following autumn applications.
  - Storage: biomass samples stored in paper bags.
  - Drying: oven-dried at 80 °C for 24 hours.
  - Grinding and analysis: ground in a ball mill and analysed with a TruSpec® Analyzer (Leco) against certified standard reference materials.
  - Quality control: data visually checked for errors.

- Data structure and variables
  - Data headers:
    - Sample_date: date samples were taken.
    - Plot_no: chamber number from which biomass samples were taken.
    - Treatment: Control, ArtUrine, RealUrine.
    - Season: Spring or Autumn (season of treatment application).
    - Biomass: above-ground biomass (g dry weight m-2).
    - Foliar_N: nitrogen content of dried, ground biomass (%).
    - Foliar_CtoN: carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of biomass samples.
  - Notes: Biomass represents above-ground dry weight; Foliar_N indicates N content; Foliar_CtoN provides C:N ratio.

- Data use, provenance, and QA
  - Data authors must be acknowledged if reused or reproduced.
  - Data provenance, quality assurance, and cleaning steps are documented (sample preparation, measurement, and validation processes described above).
  - Dataset is suitable for analysis of environmental processes related to nitrogen and carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions, with standardized metadata and measurement methods.
