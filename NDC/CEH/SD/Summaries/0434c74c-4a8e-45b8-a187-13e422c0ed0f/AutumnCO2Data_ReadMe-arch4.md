## Overview
- Dataset describes CH4 emissions measured from control (no urine), artificial urine-treated, and real urine-treated plots on orthic podzol in semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales, autumn 2016.
- Study design: randomized block.
- Data collected with an automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (LI-COR LI-820) producing high-frequency flux measurements.

## Experimental setup and data collection
- Location details: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m above sea level; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
- Instrumentation: automated GHG monitoring system; calibration with a standard after every fourth gas sample analyzed by GC.
- Sampling regime: eight flux measurements per chamber per day; 1-hour chamber closure with four gas samples per closure.
- Chamber dimensions: 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm; basal area 0.25 m2.
- Treatments: Control, ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real urine); plots organized in a randomized block design.
- Data period: emissions data analyzed by the automated system (high-frequency).

## Data content and format
- What is included: quality-assessed flux data (not raw gas concentration data).
- Data period: high-frequency measurements within the study timeframe.
- Data headers: Timestamp formatted as dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Flux data columns: Columns B to M represent CO2 fluxes (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1).
- Metadata in headers: information on treatment and chamber/plot numbers (e.g., Control, ArtUrine, Urine).

## Quality assurance and data processing
- QA procedures: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removal of problematic data (e.g., gas peak interferences).
- Data are the result of quality-assessed processing rather than raw gas concentrations, with explicit labeling of treatment, chamber, and plot.

## Provenance and metadata
- Attribution: authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Provenance details provided: exact study location, date, experimental design, instrumentation, and processing steps to support reproducibility, discoverability, and appropriate use.

## Implications for data leadership and reuse
- Emphasizes robust provenance, clear metadata, and explicit QA to enable reuse across networks.
- Demonstrates alignment of data structure with experimental design (randomized block) to facilitate downstream analysis.
- Highlights the importance of documenting measurement frequency, units, and instrument settings for interpretability and discoverability.
- Underlines attribution requirements to ensure proper credit in shared analyses.
