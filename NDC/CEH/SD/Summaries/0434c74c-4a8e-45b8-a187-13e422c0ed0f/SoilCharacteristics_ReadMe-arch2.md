## Context and purpose
- Describes soil characteristics of the Orthic Podzol at a field site used to monitor greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine applied to semi-improved pasture.
- Based on two seasonal field trials (spring and autumn) conducted during 2016–2017.
- Field location: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (53°13'N, 4°0'W), 270 m above sea level, slope 13%.
- Four replicates were taken from the control plots within each spring and autumn experimental plot.

## Site and trial design
- Soil samples collected from the site at two seasonal timepoints (spring and autumn).
- Control plots used for comparison within each season's experimental setup.
- Data describe soil characteristics at 0–5 cm or 0–10 cm depths, as specified for each measurement.

## Measurements and analytical methods
- Bulk density (BD_SP and BD_AT): 0–5 cm, corrected for stone weight/volume; expressed on a dry weight basis.
- Gravimetric soil moisture (Gravmoist_SP and Gravmoist_AT): 0–10 cm, expressed on a dry weight basis.
- Organic matter (Orgmat_SP and Orgmat_AT): % of dry soil weight.
- pH_SP and pH_AT: soil pH (0–10 cm) in 1:2.5 soil-to-distilled water suspensions.
- Electrical conductivity (EC_SP and EC_AT): µS cm-1 (0–10 cm).
- Total carbon (C_SP and C_AT) and total nitrogen (N_SP and N_AT): on a dry weight basis, 0–10 cm, using a TruSpec analyzer after oven-drying.
- Carbon to nitrogen ratio (CN_SP and CN_AT): on 0–10 cm samples.
- Nitrogen mineralisation rate (Nmin_SP and Nmin_AT): mg N kg⁻¹ day⁻¹, 0–10 cm.
- Dissolved organic carbon (DOC_SP and DOC_AT) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN_SP and TDN_AT): 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts (dry weight basis).
- Nitrate (Nitrate_SP and Nitrate_AT) and ammonium (Ammon_SP and Ammon_AT): 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts (dry weight basis).
- Phosphate (Phosph_SP and Phosph_AT): 1 M acetic acid extractable PO4³⁻ (dry weight basis).
- Exchangeable cations (Na_SP/Na_AT, K_SP/K_AT, Ca_SP/Ca_AT): 1 M acetic acid extractable cations (dry weight basis).
- Additional methods:
  - NH4+ measured by Mulvaney method; before and after anaerobic incubation (40 °C, 7 d).
  - CHCl3 fumigation-extraction for microbial biomass C and N using 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts (with KEC = 0.35, KEN = 0.5).
  - PO4 and cations measured after extraction; phosphate via Murphy and Riley; cations with a flame photometer.
  - Instruments: TruSpec® Analyzer (C and N), Multi N/C 2100S (organics/biomass), Sherwood flame photometer (for cations).
- All solutions analysed against matrix-matched certified reference standards; procedural blanks included; data QA performed.

## Data quality and standards
- Data quality assurance included visual checks and alignment with reference standards.
- All measurements were calibrated against certified standards and reported with clear provenance to ensure comparability over time.

## Data headers and variables
- The dataset uses two seasonal prefixes per variable: SP (spring) and AT (autumn).
- Example headers include: BD_SP, BD_AT, Gravmoist_SP, Gravmoist_AT, Orgmat_SP, Orgmat_AT, pH_SP, pH_AT, EC_SP, EC_AT, C_SP, C_AT, N_SP, N_AT, CN_SP, CN_AT, Nmin_SP, Nmin_AT, DOC_SP, DOC_AT, TDN_SP, TDN_AT, Nitrate_SP, Nitrate_AT, Ammon_SP, Ammon_AT, Phosph_SP, Phosph_AT, Na_SP, Na_AT, K_SP, K_AT, Ca_SP, Ca_AT.
- Describes the meaning, depth, units, and how each value is expressed (e.g., dry soil weight basis) and any corrections applied.
