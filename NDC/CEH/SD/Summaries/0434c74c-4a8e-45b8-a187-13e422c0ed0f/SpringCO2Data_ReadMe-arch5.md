# ReadMe file for SpringCO2Data.csv

## Overview
- Dataset documents CO2 emissions measured from control (no urine) artificial urine, and real urine treatments applied to an orthic podzol within semi-improved upland grassland at Henfaes Research Station, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W) during spring 2016.
- Experimental design: randomised block.
- Data represent quality-assessed flux measurements from an automated monitoring system, not raw gas concentration data.

## Experimental setup
- Location and context: Henfaes Research Station, North Wales; spring 2016.
- Treatments: Control, ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real urine).
- Plot/chamber details: Chamber basal area 0.25 m2; chambers 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (l x w x h).
- Data collection: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (LI-COR LI-820) with eight flux measurements per chamber per day.

## Data collection and processing
- Instrumentation: LI-COR LI-820 instrument; calibration standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample in the GC.
- Sampling cadence: 1-hour chamber closure period; 4 gas samples analyzed per closure period.
- Data included: quality-assessed CO2 flux data (not raw gas concentrations).
- Quality assurance: inspect raw data files and chromatograms for anomalies and remove data if necessary (e.g., gas peak interference).

## Data structure and content
- Timestamp format: dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Flux data: Columns B to M represent CO2 fluxes in mg CO2-C m-2 h-1.
- Column headers encode treatment and chamber/plot numbers (e.g., Control, ArtUrine, Urine).

## Data governance, usage, and attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Emphasizes data provenance, QA steps, and that the dataset reflects validated flux values rather than raw measurements.
- Clear guidance on how treatments are labeled and how to interpret the chamber-level data for reuse.
