# Ancillary soil measurements from a field trial investigating greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine patches deposited to a semi-improved upland grassland

## Overview
- Dataset of ancillary soil measurements collected alongside greenhouse gas flux measurements from a field trial on sheep urine patches.
- Purpose: support analysis of environmental health and policy performance through standardized, time-series soil chemistry data.

## Location, Trial Design, and Timeline
- Field trial established autumn 2016 on an orthic podzol at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (270 m a.s.l.; 53°13'N, 4°0'W).
- Semi-improved upland grassland.
- Design: randomised block with four replicates per treatment (n = 4 per treatment).

## Treatments
- Control: no urine application.
- ArtUrine: artificial urine application.
- RealUrine: real sheep urine application.
- Urine application rates: artificial urine 1004 kg N ha-1; real sheep urine 1112 kg N ha-1.

## Sampling and Depth
- Soil depth: 0–10 cm.
- Sampling method: bulked samples (n = 3) per replicate plot; 4 replicate plots per treatment.
- Timeframe: one-year time-series following treatment application.

## Sample Handling and Analysis
- Samples refrigerated after collection; processed within 24 hours.
- Soil moisture: gravimetric method (drying in oven at 105 °C for 24 h).
- pH and EC: measured on 1:2.5 soil-to-distilled water slurries with standard electrodes; calibrated with certified buffers.
- Extracts: 0.5 M K2SO4 (1:5 soil-to-solution) for nitrate, ammonium, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
- Nitrate analysis: spectrophotometric method (Miranda et al., 2001); ammonium: Mulvaney (1996); calibration with matrix-matched 6-point curves.
- TDN and DOC: measured with Multi N/C 2100S (AnalytikJena) using matrix-matched 6-point calibration.
- Data QA: procedural blanks, calibration curve checks, re-analysis as needed, manual error checking and correction.

## Data Header and Variables
- Plot: plot and chamber identifier.
- Date: sampling date (dd/mm/yy).
- Days_after: days before/after treatment application.
- Tmnt: treatment (Control, ArtUrine, RealUrine).
- Gravmoist: gravimetric soil moisture (% on a dry weight basis).
- pH: soil pH at sampling.
- EC: soil electrical conductivity (µS cm-1).
- Nitrate: 0.5 M K2SO4 extractable nitrate (mg NO3--N kg-1 soil dry weight).
- Ammon: 0.5 M K2SO4 extractable ammonium (mg NH4+-N kg-1 soil dry weight).
- TDN: 0.5 M K2SO4 extractable total dissolved nitrogen (mg N kg-1 soil dry weight).
- DOC: 0.5 M K2SO4 extractable total dissolved organic carbon (mg C kg-1 soil dry weight).

## Data Quality and Documentation
- Values of zero indicate concentrations below detection limits.
- Measurement methods and references provided for traceability:
  - Miranda, K.M., Epsey, M.G. and Wink, D.A. (2001) for nitrate/nitrite detection.
  - Mulvaney, R.L. (1996) for inorganic nitrogen forms.

## Reuse and Provenance
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are re-used or reproduced.
- Data derived from a controlled field trial with clear provenance, standardized methods, and QA procedures.
- Metadata includes location, depth, sampling timing, treatment details, and analytical methods to enable reproducibility and integration with other datasets.

## Potential Uses for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Monitor soil chemical status over time under different urine treatments.
- Compare nitrate, ammonium, TDN, and DOC dynamics in relation to greenhouse gas flux measurements.
- Integrate with broader environmental datasets to assess nitrogen cycling and soil health indicators.
- Support standardized reporting and reporting against environmental standards or policy performance over time.
