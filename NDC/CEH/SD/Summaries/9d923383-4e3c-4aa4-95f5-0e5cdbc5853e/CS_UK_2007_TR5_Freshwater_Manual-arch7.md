# Headwaters

- A national field survey component (Countryside Survey 2007) re-surveying 425 CS2000 headwater squares in GB to assess freshwater biodiversity and habitats.
- Key data types collected in headwaters:
  - Macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS)
  - Aquatic plant community
  - Hydromorphological and physical characteristics (River Habitat Survey, RHS)
  - Water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity)
- Sampling design:
  - Headwater site length fixed at 500 m for RHS; aquatic plant survey includes a 100 m reach centered on macroinvertebrate sampling.
  - In 25 of the 425 squares, 500 m sites replaced with new smaller headwater sites to ensure sampling concentrates on headwaters.
  - All 425 CS2000 squares re-surveyed; identical rho between CS2000 and CS2007 data streams for comparability.
- Data capture and field workflow:
  - On-site sampling, measurement, and data recording using standardized forms and on-site digital systems.
  - Photographs required of sampling areas, macroinvertebrate areas, RHS reaches, and MTR plant sections; marker boards used for relocation.
- Systems and data formats:
  - RHS data captured in RAPID (field digital data entry system on Tablet PC) with 17 sections across 4 pages; on-site validation and data checks before leaving site.
  - Macroinvertebrate data captured on RIVPACS Sample Area Form (site, GPS, sampling method, width/depth, substrate, environmental variables, water chemistry, etc.).
  - Aquatic plant data captured with IRIS (Mean Trophic Rank framework) for 100 m macrophyte survey; species lists, abundance categories, and physical site data on two-page form; on-site validation.
- Data quality and governance:
  - Field teams trained and certified; regular data auditing (approx. 7% of headwater sites); cross-team rotation to maintain consistency; on-site validation to minimize entry errors.
  - RHS protocol aligned to Environment Agency 2003 version for comparability with 1997 and 2003 RHS frameworks.
- Transport and sample handling:
  - Macroinvertebrate and plant samples stored in labeled pots/bags; CEH Dorset processing; transport with Transport Emergency Card (TREM) for fixatives; shipments typically in boxes with 6–8 pots per box; strict labeling and batch tracking.
  - Documentation and field sheets stapled and filed; samples and field maps stored and dispatched monthly as part of quality control.
- Spatial and GIS relevance:
  - Data are georeferenced (NGR coordinates and square identifiers) and linked to 500 m RHS reaches and 100 m macrophyte survey sections, enabling map-based visualization of habitat types, hydromorphology, and biodiversity patterns across GB.
  - Mappers and site relocation features (sketch maps, permanent landmarks) support repeatability and spatial alignment of future surveys.

# Pond Condition and Macrophyte Survey (CS2007)

- Overview: Integrated pond condition assessments within CS2007 for ponds identified in mapped squares; a survey pond is selected per square containing ponds. Mapping is conducted by mappers, with a pond condition assessment following.
- Pond mapping and surveying workflow:
  - Identify ponds within the square; define outer boundary at winter water level; map and sketch pond, estimate area, draw scale, record GPS.
  - Photograph pond with square number visible; record inflows/outflows and surrounding land use; assess turbidity prior to disturbance if water is present.
  - Record pond environmental data, macrophyte survey results, and basic water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP/TON/alkalinity).
  - Submit Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets to Pond Conservation with plant specimens as needed.
- Field sheets and forms:
  - CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheet 1 – Water quality (turbidity, pH, conductivity, SRP/TON/Alk) and water availability.
  - CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheet 2 – Environmental survey (Transects, boundary, sketch, drawdown height, water area, sediment depths, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, land use, grazing, waterbirds, fish, amphibians, amenity usage).
  - CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheet 3 – Macrophyte survey (detailed species list within pond boundary; abundance categories; submerged, floating-leaved, emergent plants; overhang).
- Macrophyte survey (MTR-based protocol):
  - A 100 m survey length is walked/waded to record presence and percent cover of macrophyte species on a 9-point scale; categories for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plants; shading and habitat context recorded.
  - Sampling requires systematic coverage of habitats within the pond boundary; grapnels may be used for submerged plants where wading is impractical.
  - Species identification targeted to species level where feasible; rare species require confirmation and possible sample submission to experts; provision for plant samples and identification keys.
  - Percentage cover estimates are spatially explicit (whole pond area considered; per-species cover is interpreted as a proportion of the pond area).
- Data recording and identification:
  - Data are entered into pond-specific sheets and labelling of specimens for ID confirmation; recommended sample submission for difficult taxa (Callitriche, Potamogeton, Ranunculus, Charophytes) with guidance on how to preserve or press specimens.
  - For plants not identifiable in the field, sampling and submission back to Pond Conservation or experts is advised; caution with rare species and legal protections.
- Ponds on square boundaries:
  - If a pond lies on square boundaries, the entire pond is surveyed; the fieldwork covers the pond area outside the square as needed for a complete condition assessment.
- Safety and field logistics:
  - Pond surveys emphasize safety around water bodies (depths, slippery banks, mats of emergent vegetation, liabilities).
  - Two surveyors minimum per pond to minimize risk; risk assessment and safety protocols followed for pond work.
- GIS and data integration implications:
  - Pond mapping data (outer boundary, area, inflows/outflows, land use around pond) supplements headwater datasets for spatial analysis.
  - Macrophyte data (species lists and cover by habitat type) enable habitat mapping and trophic/biogeochemical associations at the pond scale.
  - Transport and labeling data ensure traceability to specific CS squares and pond IDs for GIS linking and temporal comparisons.

# Data Capture Systems and Data Quality (Across Headwaters and Ponds)

- RHS (River Habitat Survey) data entry:
  - RAPID: Tablet PC-based data capture for RHS 500 m reaches; Page 1 (survey details), Page 2 (spot-checks), Page 3 (500 m sweep-up), Page 4 (dimensions and influences); validation checks ensure completeness before leaving site.
  - On-site data validation runs sequential checks and prompts for missing or inconsistent data; data tied to CS square, date, surveyor, and accreditation codes.
- Macroinvertebrate data capture:
  - RIVPACS Sample Area Form records sampling area, width, depth, velocity, substrate, habitat types, and water chemistry; field-based data capture supports later bioassessment analyses.
  - Sample area and environmental measurements are collected within a defined 500 m RHS reach and documented for reproducibility and cross-site comparability.
- Aquatic plant data capture:
  - IRIS: Two-page plant survey data entry; 100 m macrophyte survey with species added as found; abundance categories assigned; specimens collected for uncertain identifications; plant samples labeled with square and pond IDs to link to field data.
- Data quality controls:
  - Training and accreditation for RHS, macroinvertebrate, and MTR plant survey techniques; regular audits of headwater sites; field crew rotation to maintain consistency; saturation checks via on-site validation and post-survey QA.
- Logistics and data flow:
  - Samples transported to CEH Dorset with TREM labeling; field sheets paired with samples and submitted monthly; digital data captured on-site and exported for central analyses.
- GIS integration considerations:
  - All data are spatially anchored with NGR coordinates, square IDs, and survey extents (500 m RHS reaches; 100 m MTR segments; pond boundaries); photos and relocation aids support spatial re-identification for repeat surveys.
  - Data schemas (RIVPACS, RHS in RAPID, IRIS plant data) are designed to feed GIS-based visualizations of habitat diversity, hydromorphology, and macrophyte distribution across CS2007.

# Practical Notes for GIS Specialists

- Data layers you can expect:
  - Hydromorphology: RHS-derived indicators (500 m reaches, spot-checks, river channel structure, shading, habitat types).
  - Biological layers: Macroinvertebrate community metrics (RIVPACS), macrophyte cover and species composition (MTR/IRIS), water chemistry snapshots.
  - Pond layers: Pond boundaries, drawdown, turbidity, sediment composition, pollution cues, inflows/outflows, land-use context, and macrophyte inventory.
  - Spatial referencing: GPS NGRs, square identifiers, pond square allocations, relocation features, and 50–100 m survey window definitions around macroinvertebrate sampling points.
- Data interoperability:
  - Alignment with RHS 2003 protocol ensures comparability with prior CS datasets; ensure consistent coding in RAPID/IRIS to enable longitudinal GIS analyses.
  - Use standard species lists and taxonomic conventions for macrophytes; capture uncertainty and note rare species for follow-up confirmation.
- Output readiness:
  - Expect structured field data ready for ingestion into GIS for habitat mapping, biodiversity indicators, and landscape-level analyses across GB.
  - Photos and sketch maps facilitate site relocations over time and can be attached to GIS feature attributes.
