# Headwater stream water chemistry data 2007 [Countryside Survey] Data Table Descriptions

## Overview
- Describes the headwater stream water chemistry data table from the 2007 Countryside Survey.
- Contains chemical analyses from stream waters sampled at headwater sites across Great Britain.
- Key field measurements: conductivity and pH (field), and chemical determinations including soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total oxidisable nitrogen (TON), and alkalinity from 50 ml filtered samples.

## Data structure and variables
- CS_SURVEY: Year of Survey (text)
- SQUARE: 1 km square sampling site code (text)
- SITE_ID: Stream site identifier (numeric)
- SAMPLE_DATE: Date sample taken (date)
- DETERMINAND_NAME: Chemical determinand (text)
- DETERMINAND_UNITS: Units of chemical determinand (text)
- VALUE: Value of chemical determinand (numeric)
- LC07: Land class 2007 (text)
- LC07_NUM: Land class 2007 (numeric code)
- EZ_DESC_07: Environmental zone (text)
- COUNTY07: County (England & Wales) or Council (Scotland) in which the 1 km square is located (text)
- COUNTRY: England (Eng), Scotland (Sco) or Wales (Wal) (text)

## Measurements and processing notes
- Field measurements: Conductivity and pH.
- Laboratory/chemical measurements: SRP, TON, and alkalinity derived from 50 ml filtered samples.
- Data types: Mixed (text and numeric) with specific fields for site, date, determinand, units, and values.
- Additional classification references available: LC07 (land class) and EZ_DESC_07 (environmental zone).

## Data use and integration
- Data can be used to analyze headwater stream chemistry patterns and relate them to land classification and environmental zones.
- Suitable for integration with other Countryside Survey data (e.g., environmental, geographic, or temporal analyses) to enable trend analyses or cross-tabulations.
