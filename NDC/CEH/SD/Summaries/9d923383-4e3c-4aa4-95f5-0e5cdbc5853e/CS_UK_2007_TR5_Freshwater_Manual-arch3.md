# Headwaters

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) headwater component, re-surveying 425 CS2000 headwater squares and integrating a new, focused headwater stream sampling approach.
  - Aims to deliver standardized, comparable environmental health measures across GB by linking macroinvertebrate communities, hydromorphology, aquatic plants, and water chemistry.
  - Includes integration with pond condition assessment within the same CS2007 framework, highlighting cross-cutting field methods and data management.

- Sampling design and elements
  - Headwater sampling is conducted within 500 m stretches of watercourse in each square, with a nested layout to capture macroinvertebrates, hydromorphology, and water chemistry.
  - Elements to be re-surveyed in each of the 425 CS2000 squares:
    - Macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS method)
    - Environmental variables (RIVPACS RHS data)
    - Hydromorphological status (River Habitat Survey, RHS)
    - Physical characteristics of the watercourse
    - Water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity)
  - In 2007, 25 CS2007 squares with ponds will sample a randomly selected pond for macrophyte community, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - All 425 headwater squares include 500 m of watercourse sampling; 25 new headwater sites will replace CS2000 sites on longer headswater streams to focus on headwater reach length.

- Data capture and governance
  - Field data are recorded using RHS/RIVPACS data collection tools (RAPID for RHS, IRIS for macrophytes) to minimize transcription errors and enable on-site validation.
  - On-site data validation is mandatory; RAPID/IRIS provide built-in checks and prompts to ensure completeness before leaving site.
  - Photographs and sketch maps are used to facilitate site relocation in future surveys.
  - Metadata collection and data sharing are emphasized; underlying data are publicly shared where appropriate; data governance processes are implemented.

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS protocol)
  - Primary objective: maximize taxa collected from a single continuous sampling area (5–15 m, depending on stream width) using a standard 25 cm2 pond-net with 900 µm mesh.
  - Sampling approach: three-minute kick-sweep main sample plus one-minute manual search; sampling area should represent habitat proportionally and avoid mixing disparate habitats.
  - Sample handling: retain all specimens for laboratory identification; avoid preserving fish, amphibians, and certain rare taxa in the field; large or dangerous taxa may be returned to water with notes.
  - Sample fixing and storage: transfer to labeled 18" x 12" bags, add 40% formalin to achieve approximately 4% formaldehyde strength, store in labeled pots; use multiple bags if needed; care to avoid cross-contamination between sites.
  - Environmental data (RIVPACS Sample Area Form) accompanies macroinvertebrate samples and records site details, width, depth, velocity, substrate, and habitat types across the full sampling width and length.

- Water chemistry and field measurements
  - Indicative chemical sample collected downstream of the macroinvertebrate sampling area; field measurements include conductivity and pH (on-site with calibrated Hanna Combi meter) and laboratory analysis for SRP, TON, and alkalinity from filtered samples.
  - Filtration is performed on-site using disposable 0.45 µm syringe filters; detailed bottle labeling and sample handling procedures are provided to ensure correct lab assignment.

- Habitat and sampling data collection (RIVPACS RHS and on-site entries)
  - RHS protocol (2003 Environment Agency version) is implemented; data are captured in the RAPID system on a Tablet PC to validate on-site data and reduce transcription errors.
  - The RHS section covers 500 m around the macroinvertebrate sampling site and includes spot-checks, physical attributes, bank/topography, channel features, vegetation, and substrate data.
  - Data input uses drop-down menus to minimize free-text errors; validation routines ensure completeness and internal consistency before submission.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS) and data management
  - The RHS field approach records hydromorphological diversity and condition, plus a separate RAM (RAPID) system captures data in four pages with 17 sections, including spot-checks, physical attributes, land-use, and channel features.
  - On completion, a final validation confirms data completeness; data are exported to CEH or related repositories.

- Aquatic plant survey (MTR) and IRIS
  - An aquatic macrophyte survey (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR) records macrophyte presence and percent cover over a 100 m reach, centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site, with up to 9 cover categories and a 9-point percent cover scale.
  - Field techniques include wading, grappling for submerged plants, and careful attention to small patches (<25 cm2) to avoid under-recording.
  - Specimens that cannot be confidently identified in the field are collected or photographed for laboratory confirmation; a prescribed list of taxa is used to guide identifications.
  - The IRIS data entry system records species, abundance, and physical site data; specimens that require identification are labeled and preserved (pressed or picked) and sent to experts when necessary.
  - A plant fieldbook provides a structured taxonomy list and guidance on rare or difficult taxa; the system supports sampling notes and specimen labeling to link to the corresponding CS square and site.

- Macrophyte sampling and identification details
  - Species are identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level; rare or problematic taxa (e.g., Ranunculus sections) require vouchers or laboratory confirmation; some taxa may be recorded as sp. when identification is uncertain in-field.
  - A large list of plant taxa (aquatic macrophytes) is used as the standard reference for field identification and laboratory confirmation.
  - Rare species confirmation is handled with care and may require licensing or expert confirmation; digital photographs can be used where appropriate for rare taxa.

- Pond condition survey (CS2007)
  - Before pond condition assessment, mappers identify all ponds in the square; a survey pond is selected to conduct macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry surveys.
  - Two surveyors conduct pond surveys, with emphasis on safety due to working in water and near bank edges; mapping and boundary delineation are essential.
  - Procedures include photographing the pond, identifying outer boundary (winter water level), boundary sketching, drawing, and estimating pond area; recording drawdown height, proportion of water present, depth measurements, and sediment composition.
  - Water quality measurements include turbidity estimation, pH and conductivity readings, and filtering for SRP, TON, and alkalinity as for headwaters; sampling excludes inflows if possible.
  - Macrophyte survey in ponds records all wetland species within the pond boundary, with abundance estimates and a 100 m2 equivalent approach for cover estimates; grapnels and wading are used to sample submerged plants; detached material and surface mats are handled carefully to minimize habitat disturbance.
  - Plant identification is to species level where possible, with comprehensive guidance for challenging groups; specimens may be sent for laboratory confirmation when necessary.
  - Descriptions of pond management, grazing, waterbird and fish/amphibian presence, surrounding land use, and amenity value (views and public access) are recorded to contextualize indicators of ecological health.
  - Documentation includes a Macrophyte Survey recording sheet, with abundance categories, cover percentages for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plants, and overhanging tree vegetation.
  - The pond condition workflow also includes instructions for sampling and transporting macroinvertebrate and plant specimens to CEH, including transport emergency cards and monthly dispatch schedules.

- Data handling, quality control, and governance
  - Data are stored and managed using standardized field data systems (RAPID for RHS, IRIS for aquatic plants) to ensure data integrity and traceability to the CS square and pond.
  - Quality control measures include certification of field surveyors, regular team rotations, audits of headwater sites, and on-site data validation to minimize errors.
  - Field checklists ensure that all tasks are completed before leaving a site; documentation supports reproducibility and future relocation of sites.

- Transport, storage, and dissemination
  - In-field sample handling and transport protocols (including TREM cards for hazardous fixatives) guide safe transit to CEH laboratories.
  - Samples and field sheets are dispatched monthly or as batches reach a threshold, with clear guidance on packaging, labeling, and submission to CEH Dorset or Pond Conservation as appropriate.
  - Data and reports are prepared for dissemination to partner organizations and are used to inform environmental policy and future monitoring decisions.

- References and guiding sources
  - The methodology draws on established River Habitat Survey (RHS, Environment Agency 2003), RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling, Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) macrophyte survey methods, and the IRIS and RAPID data-entry systems for field data capture.
