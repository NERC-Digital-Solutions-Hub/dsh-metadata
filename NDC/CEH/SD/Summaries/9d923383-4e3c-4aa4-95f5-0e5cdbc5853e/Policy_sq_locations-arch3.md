# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: Maximise the usefulness of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data for public-interest outcomes while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity; this policy specifically governs survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares. All other CS data remain publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Natural England (NE), Welsh Government (WG), Scottish Government (SG), Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), Forestry Commission (FC), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).

Why locations are confidential:
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, both essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permissions.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

Circumstances for location release and precision:
- General access: allows users to identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, or Environmental Zone) without revealing precise locations.
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km cells): can be released under licence for approximate location identification.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations): released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may pre-process analysis to avoid direct release; external release requires demonstration that IP/confidential data in the external work is equally or more protected than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (habitat maps, linear features): could enable square identification; released under the same exceptional-terms as six-digit references.
- Licences for four-digit releases are similar but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria; specific use restrictions apply as described below.

Specific conditions of release:
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm data destruction and continued confidentiality.
- No third-party release that could compromise square locations; if in doubt, consult CEH.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to monitor landowners’ compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases are less stringent than six-digit releases but still prohibit attempts to deduce precise locations.

Responsibilities and governance:
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, with licences signed by authorized representatives.
- If a release request is denied, CEH supports the decision under the applicable Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS partnership needs, CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before committing to data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be direct or via collaboration or payment arrangements, negotiated case-by-case.
