# Headwater stream water chemistry data 2007 [Countryside Survey] Data Table Descriptions

## Purpose and scope
- Provides headwater stream water chemistry data from the 2007 Countryside Survey.
- Data are organized in the STREAM_CHEMISTRY_2007.csv table to enable standardized environmental monitoring and temporal comparisons.

## Data structure and fields
- Table name: STREAM_CHEMISTRY_2007.csv
- Measurements include:
  - Conductivity and pH: field measurements
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total oxidisable nitrogen (TON), and alkalinity: determined from 50 ml filtered samples
- Key columns and descriptions:
  - CS_SURVEY: Year of Survey (text)
  - SQUARE: 1 km square sampling site code (text)
  - SITE_ID: Stream site identifier (numeric)
  - SAMPLE_DATE: Date sample taken (date)
  - DETERMINAND_NAME: Chemical determinand (text)
  - DETERMINAND_UNITS: Units of chemical determinand (text)
  - VALUE: Value of chemical determinand (numeric)
  - LC07: Land class 2007 (text)
  - LC07_NUM: Land class 2007 (numeric code)
  - EZ_DESC_07: Environmental zone (text)
  - COUNTY07: County or equivalent (text)
  - COUNTRY: England, Scotland, or Wales (text)

## Measurements and methods
- Data collected as standardized measurements across headwater sites.
- Field measurements: conductivity and pH.
- Laboratory-derived values: SRP, TON, and alkalinity from filtered 50 ml samples.
- Land classification and environmental zoning linked to established classifications (ITE Land Classification GB 2007; environmental zones).
