# Headwater stream water chemistry data 2007 [Countryside Survey] Data Table Descriptions

## Overview
- Describes the Headwater stream - water chemistry data collected in 2007 as part of the Countryside Survey.
- Chemical analyses include field measurements (conductivity and pH) and filtered samples for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total oxidisable nitrogen (TON), and alkalinity.

## Data content and methods
- Data type: Text table describing measurement data, with 50 ml filtered samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity; field measurements for conductivity and pH.
- Sampling context: Headwater streams sampled in 2007.
