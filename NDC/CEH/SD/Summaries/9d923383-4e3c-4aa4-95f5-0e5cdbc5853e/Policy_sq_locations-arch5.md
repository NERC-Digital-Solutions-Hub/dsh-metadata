# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and continued landowner permission for future surveys.
- Confidentiality is considered in the public interest; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access circumstances and location precision

- Allowed use: Determine whether CS squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references: Release allowed under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square; supports limited location disclosure.
- Six-digit grid references: Only in very exceptional circumstances; must be justified legally that external data/assets require equal/higher confidentiality than CS data; external release requires licensing through CEH.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps): Treated as potentially enabling square identification; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- Four-digit releases: Licence terms similar to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria; still restricted by purpose and use conditions.

## Specific licence conditions

- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- Post-project destruction: licensees must confirm in writing that data has remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have a less stringent IP requirement than six-digit releases and include a clause preventing attempts to deduce precise square locations from the data.

## Roles, responsibilities, and governance

- Decision-maker: CEH, acting for NERC, determines exceptional releases; issues hard-copy licences (four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data) with appropriate clauses.
- Denials: If approval is denied, CEH follows the UK Act and Regulations procedures.
- Oversight and reporting: CEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- Practical support: CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing analysis for CS partners within moderate demand; requests from other organizations handled case-by-case.
- Consultation: Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to work with data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or fee-based, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for data stewards

- Implement confidentiality controls for location data, including secure storage, access controls, and license tracking.
- Manage licensing periods, renewal needs, and post-project destruction confirmations.
- Establish procedures for handling exceptional six-digit and spatial data requests, including legal justification and IP-protection considerations.
- Maintain documentation and annual reporting obligations through CEH, and coordinate with CS partners on access needs and potential pre-processing support.
- Encourage early consultation with CEH to define requirements and appropriate use of CS location data.
