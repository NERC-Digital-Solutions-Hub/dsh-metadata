# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

- Partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - The Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Rationale for confidentiality
  - Confidential locations help preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Access and release conditions
  - Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square for approximate location needs.
  - Six-digit grid references: released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must demonstrate that external IP/data are equally or more confidential.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps): released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
  - If possible, pre-processing analysis by CEH to avoid releasing precise locations; otherwise exceptional access may be granted.

- Licensing terms
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed after the licensing period.
  - No release to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
  - A clause prevents licensees from using the data to deduce exact square locations.

- Responsibilities and process
  - CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - Denials follow the Act and Regulations procedures; CEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - For internal CS partner use, CEH should provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or negotiated as needed.
