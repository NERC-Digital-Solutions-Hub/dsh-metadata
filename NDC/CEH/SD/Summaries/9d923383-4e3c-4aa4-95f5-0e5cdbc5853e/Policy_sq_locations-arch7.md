# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Purpose: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserve sampling-site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protect future surveying capability, environmental integrity, and permission from landowners.
- Confidentiality supports reliable policy-relevant environmental information.

## When and how locations may be released
- Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: released only under very exceptional circumstances; external requests must demonstrate that the IP/data to be used with CS data has equal or higher confidentiality protection and cannot be released to CEH.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps): could be used to identify a square and will be released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- In all cases, the release is governed by licences and strict conditions.

## Specific conditions of release
- Confidentiality must be preserved; data stored securely; access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite-term and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- At licence end, organisations must confirm destruction of data.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Location data cannot be used to plan or plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees may need to show evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP-confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; four-digit releases cannot be used to try to pinpoint exact square locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences; sign-off must be by a senior authorised official.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may assist with defining requirements or providing support, either collaboratively or for payment (negotiated case-by-case).

## Practical implications for GIS work
- Use aggregated or pre-processed data when possible to avoid compromising confidential locations.
- For projects requiring precise locations, prepare for a licensing process and potential exceptional-access criteria.
- Coordinate with CEH early to understand licensing timelines, data handling requirements, and post-project destruction obligations.
