# HEADWATERS

- Purpose and scope
  - Countryside Survey 2007 activities for headwater streams and ponds in Great Britain.
  - Collect standardized data on macroinvertebrates (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey, RHS), aquatic plants (macrophytes) and pond condition (mapping, water quality, environmental context).
  - Use field digital data entry systems (RAPID for RHS, IRIS for aquatic plants) to improve data quality and on-site validation; data flows to CEH bases and Pond Conservation.

- Datasets and data streams
  - Headwaters macroinvertebrate data (RIVPACS) plus RIVPACS environmental variables, stream width/depth/velocity, substrate, altitude.
  - RHS hydromorphological data captured via RAPID in the field.
  - Aquatic plant data (macrophytes) captured via IRIS (mean trophic rank, MTR-based).
  - Water chemistry data (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity) collected at headwater sites.
  - Pond condition data: pond mapping, environmental survey, macrophyte survey, water chemistry; includes boundary delineation, drawdown, turbidity, sediment and pond base, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, and surrounding land use.
  - Photographs and relocation aids to support future site re-location.

- Data collection methods (headwaters)
  - 425 squares re-surveyed; headwater sampling includes 500 m macroscale reach; 25 new headwater sites chosen within squares.
  - In each square: macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS) plus RHS environmental data and plant surveys.
  - At 25 squares with ponds: a randomly selected pond is surveyed for macrophytes, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Photographs required for macroinvertebrate areas, RHS reach, and MTR plant survey.

- Data collection methods (pond condition)
  - Mapping of ponds within the square; identify the survey pond after mapping.
  - Condition survey steps: photo, outer boundary, sketch, area estimation, drawdown height, water presence, sediment and pond base, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, pond management, surrounding land use, amenity value.
  - Macrophyte survey within outer pond boundary (100 m length for plants) with identification to species where possible; abundance estimates by cover; collection of specimens for lab ID when needed; handling of rare species and preservation/packing of specimens.
  - Water quality sampling in ponds (conductivity, pH, SRP/TON/alkalinity) with on-site filtration and standardized bottle labeling; turbidity estimation.

- Data standards, metadata and validation
  - Consistent use of forms and data-entry screens (RIVPACS Sample Area Form; RHS field forms; MTR/IRIS; IRIS plant form; pond condition sheets).
  - On-site validation via RAPID and IRIS before leaving site; automatic data checks to ensure completeness and internal consistency.
  - Use of drop-downs and standardized codes to minimize free-text errors; -9 treated as missing until completed.
  - Calibration and operation guidance for equipment (e.g., Hanna pH/conductivity meter; two-point pH calibration; site-specific measurement instructions).
  - Comprehensive field notes, GPS coordinates (NGR), date, square/pond identifiers, surveyor names, and sample times captured for traceability.

- Sample handling, storage and transport
  - Macroinvertebrate and plant specimens packed in labeled containers with fixative (40% formalin/4% formaldehyde equivalent) and appropriate preservation methods; separate packaging for transport safety.
  - Transport boxes labeled with Transport Emergency Card (TREM) and CEH/Joseph contact details; shipment to CEH Dorset as soon as feasible (6–8 pots per box, upright transport).
  - All samples catalogued and stored at CEH base until shipment; monthly courier to processing lab; plant specimens sent for ID confirmation with appropriate labeling.
  - Documentation and chain-of-custody maintained with transporter details and project identifiers.

- Equipment and field logistics
  - Detailed equipment lists for headwaters and pond surveys, including safety gear, nets, maps, grapnels, meters, sample bottles, labels, clipboards, and digital devices.
  - Safety checks and risk assessments emphasized for field sampling, especially in headwaters and pond environments.

- Data governance and quality assurance
  - Teams trained and certified in RHS, macroinvertebrate (RIVPACS-compatible) methods and MTR plant survey.
  - Regular team rotation to maintain consistency; approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff.
  - Field survey check-lists to ensure completion of all tasks before departure.
  - Data captured via tablet-based systems (RAPID for RHS; IRIS for macrophytes) to reduce transcription errors and enable on-site validation.

- End-to-end workflow (summary)
  - Pre-field mapping and pond identification; establish survey pond where applicable.
  - Conduct headwater RHS, macroinvertebrate sampling, aquatic plant survey, and water chemistry measurements in a coordinated sequence; record data in RAPID and IRIS.
  - For ponds, perform boundary mapping, 100 m macrophyte survey, environmental data, and water chemistry; collect and preserve plant specimens as needed.
  - Validate data in the field; collect and label samples for transport; complete and staple field sheets; dispatch to CEH Pond Conservation and Dorset lab for processing.
  - Archive and share data through Pond Conservation pathways; ensure data discoverability and traceability for future re-surveys.

- Key governance implications for data stewards
  - Manage multi-system data workflows (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR) with standardized metadata fields and cross-referencing between forms.
  - Enforce consistent data quality controls, on-site validation, and regular audits to ensure comparability across GB headwaters and ponds.
  - Maintain rigorous sample labeling, storage, and transport records; ensure timely submission and archiving of physical samples and digital data.
  - Monitor and document data lineage, including sampling methods, equipment used, calibration records, and any deviations from standard protocols.
  - Provide clear data sharing pathways to Pond Conservation and CEH labs; ensure provenance, reproducibility, and re-use potential of datasets.

Note: The document also contains extensive, step-by-step methodologies, forms, and supported guidance (e.g., sampling techniques for kick-net macroinvertebrates, MTR macrophyte surveying protocols, pond condition metrics, photodocumentation standards, and data-entry screen designs) intended to standardize data collection and facilitate high-quality, comparable datasets for national freshwater surveys.
