# Countryside Survey 2007 Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey Handbook

- Provides the data collection, handling, and quality control framework for CS2007 headwater stream and pond condition assessments, including macroinvertebrate sampling, river habitat survey (RHS), aquatic macrophyte surveys, and water chemistry.
- Aims to enable consistent, sharable data products andself-serve exploration by end users.

## Study design and scope

- Headwaters: re-survey 425 squares from CS2000 for headwater streams, collecting macroinvertebrate community data (RIVPACS), hydromorphological data (River Habitat Survey), aquatic plant community data (MTR), physical characteristics, and a water chemistry snapshot (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity).
- Ponds: identify all ponds in each square, nominate a survey pond per square, and conduct pond macrophyte surveys, environmental characteristics, and water chemistry where water is present.
- Pond and headwater data are intended to be compatible with national freshwater survey frameworks and linked across data products.

## Data collection framework and data models

- Multi-layer data collection: macroinvertebrates (RIVPACS), RHS hydromorphology, macrophytes (MTR), and water chemistry. All data are designed for integration across sites and time.
- Standardized data entry forms and digital data capture tools to minimize transcription errors and improve data quality.
- Clear definitions of sample areas, survey extents, and measurement points to ensure comparability across sites and years.

## Field data capture and systems

- Data entry systems:
  - RAPID: River Habitat Survey field digital data entry for RHS data (MS Access on Tablet PC). Handles 500 m RHS surveys centered on macroinvertebrate sampling sites with on-site validation.
  - IRIS: Aquatic plant survey data entry (MTR-based) for macrophyte data (MS Access on Tablet PC). Supports species lists, abundance coding, and specimen management.
  - RIVPACS Sample Area Form: Paper/form-based environmental and sampling data for macroinvertebrate sites.
- Validation and quality checks:
  - On-site data validation in RAPID and IRIS (checks for missing fields and inconsistencies; prompts corrective action).
  - Field survey checklist ensures completion of all tasks before leaving a site.
  - Approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff for QA.

## Sampling design and procedures

- Headwater sampling:
  - 500 m sampling stretch per site; aquatic plant survey within a 100 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling point.
  - 10 spot-checks along the RHS stretch for habitat and environmental data, plus a 50 m upstream and 50 m downstream focus for plant surveys.
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling via standard three-minute kick-net method plus one minute of manual search; retain representative taxa for lab ID, with exceptions for fish, amphibians, and certain rare species.
  - Water chemistry: one indicative sample downstream of the macroinvertebrate area; field measurements for conductivity and pH; filtered samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity.
- Pond sampling:
  - Pond mapping to identify pond boundaries, area, drawdown, sediment/water depths, and pollution indicators.
  - Macrophyte survey within pond boundary; abundance recorded as cover categories; specimens collected for lab confirmation when needed.
  - Environmental survey including land use around pond, inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, and amenity use.

## Data collection instruments and outputs

- RIVPACS: macroinvertebrate sampling area form captures site details, sampling method, width/depth, substrate, habitat types, water chemistry, and photographs.
- RHS (River Habitat Survey): field data captured via RAPID; 17 sections across 4 pages, including spot-checks and overall site attributes; on-site validation required.
- MTR macrophyte survey: 100 m reach; species presence and percent cover, coded by categories; specimen handling guidelines and lab confirmation procedures.
- IRIS: aquatic plant data entry for 100 m MTR survey; species list, abundance, and physical site data; on-site validation and specimen handling guidance.
- Pond condition sheets: include pond boundary, water turbidity, drawdown, water chemistry, sediment/bottom characteristics, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, pond management, livestock/waterbird/fish/amphibian evidence, surrounding land use, amenity value, and macrophyte survey results.

## Data quality, labeling, and sample transport

- Thorough labeling required for all macroinvertebrate and plant samples (including square/pond IDs, date, surveyor, and sample type).
- Samples transported to CEH Dorset in specified containers; use Transport Emergency Card (TREM) for hazardous materials (e.g., formaldehyde in fixatives).
- Regular dispatch cadence: send 6–8 macroinvertebrate pots per box; label and ship to CEH Dorset; plant vouchers posted to Pond Conservation as needed.
- Documentation and forms:
  - Pond Mapping Recording Sheets for pond boundary, area, and perimeters.
  - Field survey checklists for both RHS/macros and pond components.
  - Sample information sheets and lab requisitions to ensure correct laboratory analyses.

## Analytical methods and taxonomic standards

- Macrophytes:
  - Identification to species level where possible; use standard taxonomic references; representative samples for confirmation when necessary (notably Ranunculus and some Potamogeton taxa).
  - Abundance estimates and total cover for submerged, floating, and emergent vegetation; shade over pond area quantified.
  - Special attention to rare or legally protected species; guidance provided for collection and confirmation with minimal disturbance.
- Macroinvertebrates:
  - Standard RIVPACS-based approach; 3-minute kick sample plus 1-minute manual search; comprehensive habitat sampling proportional to area coverage.
  - Habitat variables recorded across the full sampling area (width, depth, substrate, vegetation, etc.) for RIVPACS environmental data.
  - Photographs to support relocation and site description.
- Hydromorphology:
  - RHS indices updated to the 2003 Environment Agency protocol; data entered and validated in RAPID for consistency and comparability with earlier CS iterations.

## Pond survey specifics

- Ponds defined as standing water bodies between 25 m2 and 2 ha, usually holding water for at least four months.
- Mapping and surveying steps include boundary identification, sketch maps, area estimation, drawdown height, and assessment of inflows/outflows and pollution cues.
- Macrophyte survey focuses on all wetland plants within the pond boundary; depth- and habitat-specific search strategies using grapnels in deeper areas.
- Plant identification and voucher handling with specific recommendations for difficult groups (Callitriche, Potamogeton, Ranunculus, Charophytes).
- Environmental and amenity data collected to support broader landscape context (surrounding land use, open access, and use by water birds or humans).

## Accessibility, training, and governance

- Training and accreditation required for RHS, macroinvertebrate sampling, and MTR plant surveys (Environment Agency and CEH-led).
- Data standards aligned with national methods (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR) to ensure cross-year comparability and data-sharing readiness.
- Final field data validated on-site; all sections stapled and filed with appropriate samples before dispatch.

## End-to-end workflow and delivery

- Field data collection in the square, with on-site calibration, sample collection, and data entry into RAPID/IRIS.
- On-site validation and completion checks prior to departure.
- Samples and forms dispatched to CEH Dorset for processing; plant specimens sent to Pond Conservation; digital outputs stored and shared per project protocols.
- Documentation includes contact details for data processing and QA contacts, ensuring traceability and accountability.
