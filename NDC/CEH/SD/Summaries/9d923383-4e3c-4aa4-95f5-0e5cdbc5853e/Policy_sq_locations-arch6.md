# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- The policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- All other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.

## CS Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys’ scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permission.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released (and precision levels)
- Release can show whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references (precise) require pre-processing analysis by CEH if possible; otherwise exceptional external release may be granted.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could identify square locations; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- In VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, location information may be provided externally under licence if the requesting organisation proves IP/data confidentiality is at least as strict as CS data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration and for specific projects; data must not be retained for unrelated responsibilities.
- End-of-licence: must confirm data was secure and destroyed.
- No data or images should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check compliance by landowners.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of JCOP-aligned project management standards.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit ones but do not require the same IP confidentiality level.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licences require signing by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH must provide an annual report on access applications and decisions.
- For practical processing needs, CEH aims to support reasonable pre-processing timeframes; case-by-case basis for non-CS-partner requests.
- Partner organisations are encouraged to consult CEH before using data; CEH involvement can be collaborative or paid and is negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for users
- Consult CEH before committing to CS location data use.
- CEH involvement in your project may vary; collaboration or support can be arranged as appropriate.
