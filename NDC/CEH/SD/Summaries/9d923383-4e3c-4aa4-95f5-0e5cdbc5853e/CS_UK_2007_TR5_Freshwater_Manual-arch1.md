# Countryside Survey 2007 Headwaters

- A national GB freshwater survey component focusing on headwater streams and ponds, designed to detect correlations, report findings, and inform practical decisions through standardized data collection.
- Re-survey of CS2000 headwater squares (425 squares) in CS2007 to sample macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey, RHS), physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
- In CS2007, ponds are surveyed in randomly selected squares containing ponds (629 CS2007 squares with ponds), with pond macrophyte and environmental data collected in a designated survey pond.

## Scope, design and sampling framework

- Headwaters module:
  - Every CS2000 headwater square (425) will be re-surveyed in CS2007.
  - Elements per headwater square: macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS), aquatic plant community, hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey), physical habitat characteristics, and water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity).
  - Headwater sampling area: a 500 m length of watercourse per site; 100 m aquatic plant (MTR) survey length centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site.
  - 25 of the 425 headwater squares will sample a new site on a smaller watercourse to improve headwater coverage.
- Pond module:
  - All ponds within each square mapped; one pond per square selected as the survey pond for macrophyte, environmental characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Pond definition: standing water 25 m2 to 2 ha, typically containing water for at least four months of the year.
  - Fieldwork involves pond mapping, boundary identification, area estimation, drawdown, sediment/water depth, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, land-use context, and amenity assessments.

## Data capture and management

- Field data capture systems:
  - RHS data entered on site via RAPID (Tablet PC-based; MS Access) to reduce transcription errors and enable on-site validation.
  - Aquatic plant data entered via IRIS (Tablet PC-based; MS Access) to standardize plant cover data and specimen handling.
  - Macroinvertebrate environmental data recorded on RIVPACS Sample Area forms.
- Data quality and governance:
  - On-site validation with iterative “Check Data” processes to identify and correct missing or inconsistent fields.
  - Approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH with repeat sampling to ensure consistency.
  - Data and field notes are designed to be discoverable, with careful metadata and standardized forms.
- Sample handling and transport:
  - Macroinvertebrate samples fixed in 40% formaldehyde to achieve ~4% formaldehyde liquor; samples stored in labeled pots/bags and shipped to CEH Dorset (6–8 pots per box) with TREM cards for transport safety.
  - Plant specimens for identification posted or couriered to Pond Conservation; pressed specimens, alcohol-preserved specimens, and documentation carefully labeled to link to the CS square/pond.

## Headwater sampling protocols

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS-compatible):
  - Sample area: single continuous stretch 5–15 m long, proportional habitat sampling, 3 minutes of active pond-netting plus 1 minute of manual searching.
  - Net: standard pond-net (25 cm2) with 900 μm mesh; maintain cleanliness between samples; remove material to prevent net clogging.
  - Manual search: two parts totaling 1 minute; search on water surface first, then organisms attached to submerged substrates; ensure thorough search even if fruitless.
  - Habitat coverage: sample proportionally by habitat type; avoid combining disparate habitats into one extended sample.
  - Post-sampling: transfer to labeled sample containers; fix with 40% formalin to reach ~4% formaldehyde; label with CS square, pond/invert code, date.
  - Data recording: use RIVPACS Sample Area Form to capture site coordinates, method, time, width, depth, velocity, substratum, and habitat proportions; take photographs with marker boards for relocation.
- Water chemistry sampling:
  - In-field indicator measurements: conductivity and pH using Hanna Combi meter.
  - SRP, TON, and alkalinity: filtered water samples collected in 50 mL bottles after on-site filtration through 0.45 μm syringe filters; labeling and shipping to CEH for analysis.
  - Sampling procedure: collect downstream end of macroinvertebrate area, rinse bottles, filter water carefully, label with square, date, and square/pond info, and ship in padded envelopes.
- Environmental data collection (RIVPACS Sample Area Form):
  - Measurements to capture at a representative point within the sampling area: width, depth (at ¼, ½, ¾), surface velocity (category-based), substratum composition, bedrock/rocks, and percentages for other habitats (moss, filamentous algae, higher plants, etc.).
  - Substratum and habitat assessments cover the entire sample area width; bed stability categories (solid, stable, unstable, soft/sinking) and substrate size classes (bedrock, boulders, pebbles, sand, silt/clay, peat, artificial).
  - Sketch map to aid relocation, including channel form, banks, landmarks, distances, grid north, and surrounding land use.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS) and data entry:
  - RHS has moved to 2003 Environment Agency protocol; field data captured via RAPID to ensure standardized, validated RHS entries.
  - 500 m RHS section centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site; flexibility rules if sampling cannot be centered on the macroinvertebrate site.

## Aquatic plant survey (MTR) and data capture

- Macrophyte survey (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR) method:
  - A 100 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate site is walked/waded; record presence and percent cover for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent macrophytes; use a 9-point cover scale.
  - Sampling approaches depend on accessibility: wade through channels where safe; grapnel to retrieve submerged plants where wading is impractical; record patchy occurrences and rare species carefully.
  - Identification and specimen handling:
    - Aim for species-level identification; use field guides and lab confirmation for difficult taxa (e.g., Ranunculus, Callitriche, Potamogeton, charophytes).
    - Collect representative samples for lab confirmation when field identification is uncertain; preserve pressed samples or store in alcohol for voucher verification.
  - Specimen handling for laboratories:
    - Detailed guidance on pressing, labeling, and shipping specimens to Pond Conservation or labs; avoid damage to rare species.
- IRIS data entry for plants:
  - Species added to a list with associated cover percentage; if no plants are recorded in the 100 m stretch, select “NO SPECIES ENTERED” and still fill Page 2 physical data.
  - Specimens that cannot be identified on-site are labeled and sent for lab confirmation; IRIS supports indeterminate entries and specimen labeling conventions.
- Macrophyte identification and rare species:
  - Taxonomic list provided; emphasis on accuracy for rare species; special handling and potential expert confirmation required.

## Pond condition survey (mapping, environment, and macrophytes)

- Pre-survey mapping and pond identification:
  - Ponds mapped in each square; a single survey pond is identified for comprehensive macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry surveys.
  - Boundary and outline drawn; outer boundary defined by the winter water level; sketch and scale bar created; boundary and boundary-associated features documented.
- Pond condition survey steps:
  - Photos: take a photo of the pond with the square number visible; photograph the entire pond area when possible.
  - Boundaries and area: identify and sketch boundary; estimate pond area via pace-based measurements and shape approximation; determine drawdown height (difference between maximum winter water level and current water level).
  - Water turbidity and chemistry: estimate turbidity visually; collect water chemistry samples (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity) with filtered water as described for headwaters.
  - Sediment and pond base: estimate sediment and pond base composition (organic matter, ooze, gravel/sand, rock, peat, etc.); record depth measurements at transect points if possible.
  - Inflows/outflows: document inflows/outflows; measure flow rates where possible.
  - Pollution and land use: record presence of pollution and surrounding land use in two distance zones (0–5 m and 0–100 m).
  - Pond management and livestock/waterfowl use: document management actions, grazing indicators, waterbird use, fish presence, and amphibians if observed.
  - Surrounding land use: estimate land-use categories within two distance zones; capture general habitat types and potential influences.
  - Amenity value: assess visibility from roads/footpaths and public access; record evidence of amenity use.
- Macrophyte survey in ponds:
  - Record all macrophyte species within the pond boundary; estimate abundance (dominant, abundant, frequent, occasional, rare) and total cover for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species.
  - Taxonomic references and sample submission guidelines provided; rare or legally protected species flagged for careful handling and potential lab confirmation.
  - Lab confirmation for particularly difficult taxa; specimen submission guidelines included.

## Field survey checklists, QA, and logistics

- Field survey check-list:
  - A structured checklist ensures completion of RHS, macroinvertebrate sampling, aquatic plant surveying, and related tasks at each headwater site.
- Transport and sample handling:
  - Transport containers and safety measures (TREM cards) used for macroinvertebrate samples.
  - Samples sent to CEH Dorset in batches (6–8 pots per box); plant specimens sent to Pond Conservation; proper labeling and traceability required.
- Training and quality control:
  - All field staff hold recognized RHS/RIVPACS/MIR/plant surveying qualifications.
  - Regular team rotations to standardize methods; field audits conducted by CEH staff; on-site validation of data to ensure quality.
