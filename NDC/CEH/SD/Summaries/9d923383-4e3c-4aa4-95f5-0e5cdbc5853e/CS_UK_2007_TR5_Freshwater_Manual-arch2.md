# Headwaters

- Purpose and scope
  - National freshwater monitoring component of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Re-survey of 425 squares from CS2000 to assess headwater streams
  - In each surveyed square, headwater stream elements are tracked: macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, hydromorphological characteristics (River Habitat Survey, RHS), physical characteristics, and water chemistry
  - In squares containing ponds (629 CS2007 squares), a randomly selected pond is surveyed for aquatic plants, physical characteristics, and water chemistry

- Sampling design and data types
  - Headwaters: 500 m stream reach for RHS and macroinvertebrates; 100 m aquatic plant survey stretch centered on macroinvertebrate and water-chemistry sampling
  - Ponds: 100 m macrophyte survey length around pond, plus pond boundary and environmental data
  - Data capture via field-specific digital systems (RAPID for RHS, IRIS for aquatic plants)

- Data collection workflow
  - Two-person freshwater survey teams (A and B) with defined task sequencing
  - On-site data capture using standardized forms and tablets; data validated on-site
  - Equipment and safety procedures standardized; field notes and photographs required for relocation and verification

- Methods and procedures (highlights)
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling
    - Standard three-minute kick-sweep method plus mandatory one-minute manual search
    - Use 25 cm2 pond-net with 900 µm mesh; sample areas chosen to cover major habitats proportionally
    - Avoid over-sampling deep or inaccessible sections; preserve sample integrity; fix and label specimens for lab analysis
    - On-site data recording: macroinvertebrate sample area, width, depth, velocity, substrate, habitat types, and water chemistry readings
  - Water chemistry sampling
    - Conductivity and pH measured in the field (Hanna Combi meter)
    - SRP, TON, and alkalinity analyzed from filtered water samples (on-site filtration with disposable syringe filters; 50 ml bottles)
    - Detailed bottle labeling and chain-of-custody procedures standard
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - 500 m reaches centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site
    - RHS data entered into RAPID; site spot-checks recorded; immediate on-site validation
  - Aquatic plant survey (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR)
    - 100 m macrophyte survey length; presence and percent cover of submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plants recorded on a 9-point scale
    - Systematic wading and grapnel use to sample submerged plants; specimen collection for lab confirmation when needed
    - Species identified to the extent possible; rare or problematic taxa flagged for lab confirmation
  - Data handling and integration
    - RHS data captured and stored via RAPID; plant data via IRIS
    - On-site data checks ensure data completeness before leaving the site
    - Samples and field sheets sent to CEH Dorset (macroinvertebrates) and Pond Conservation (plants)

- Quality control, training, and safety
  - All field teams hold Environment Agency RHS/RIVPACS training and accreditation
  - Regular role rotation to maintain consistency across teams
  - Approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff
  - Field surveys conducted under standard safety protocols; two-person teams; transport and hazard management (TREM cards)

- Outcomes and data flows
  - On-site data capture reduces transcription errors; validated datasets feed into national analyses of habitat condition and ecological status
  - Data and samples routed to CEH Dorset and Pond Conservation for processing and archiving
  - Outputs support monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time

- Supporting elements
  - Photographs and sketch maps accompany sampling to aid relocation and future site identification
  - Documentation and references underpin standardized RHS and MTR methodologies
  - Reference systems (RAPID and IRIS) are used to ensure data quality and interoperability

- Context and timeline
  - Builds on CS1990 and CS2000 approaches; progresses to CS2007 with updated RHS protocol (2003 EA version)
  - Headwaters component designed to be nationally comparable across GB

- Key considerations for analysts
  - Consistent application of sampling area definitions and habitat proportionality across sites
  - Rigorous on-site data validation to minimize post-field data cleaning
  - Integration of macroinvertebrate, hydromorphology, and macrophyte data to assess river health and trophic status
