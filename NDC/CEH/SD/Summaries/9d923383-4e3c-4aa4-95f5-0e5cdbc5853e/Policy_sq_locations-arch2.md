# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Current CS partners listed (see below).

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Preserve scientific integrity of sampling strategy, environmental protection, and ability to secure future survey access.
- Confidentiality supports ongoing ability to inform environmental policy.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Circumstances and precision of release
- Allowed releases: approximate identification within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) using four-digit grid references.
- Six-digit grid references: only if absolutely essential; CEH to perform pre-processing to avoid release where possible.
- Very exceptional cases: potential external release of location information under licence, with stringent confidentiality considerations; the external IP or data must have equal/higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data inside survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry confidentiality risk similar to location data and are released only under the same exceptional conditions.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences granted for finite periods; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation that location data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No sharing of data or derived information to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases: similar licensing terms but do not require the same high-level IP confidentiality as six-digit releases; a clause prevents attempts to derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by an authorized senior representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under relevant Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal CS partner use (pre-processing) within reasonable timeframes; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be direct or advisory, with negotiation on collaboration or payment as needed.

## Implications for analysts monitoring the environment
- Data access is controlled to protect sampling integrity while enabling policy-relevant monitoring.
- Opportunities to use aggregated (four-digit) location data under licences; six-digit data require justification and CEH processing.
- Pre-processing by CEH may facilitate data usage without exposing precise locations.
- Annual reporting and case-by-case consideration ensure transparency and accountability in data sharing.
- Emphasizes balancing data utility for environmental monitoring with robust safeguards for landowner cooperation and survey continuity.
