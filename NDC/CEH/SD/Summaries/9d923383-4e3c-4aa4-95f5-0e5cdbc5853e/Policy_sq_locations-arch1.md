Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- All other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Current CS Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- The Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Maintain scientific integrity of sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under FOIA 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Allowance to identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class or Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external user must demonstrate that their independent data/IP confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data from within survey squares could indirectly reveal square locations; released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality; secure storage; access limited to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed at licence end.
- No data or images should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit but with lower IP confidentiality requirements; licenses prohibit attempts to derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities and processes
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Licences must be signed by a senior official of the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI/Regulations processes to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report summarising location-data applications and decision grounds.
- Internal pre-processing support: CEH aims to assist CS partners within reasonable timeframes; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before using any data covered by the policy; CEH may assist as a scientific lead or define requirements; collaboration or payment arrangements may apply.
