Groundwater chemistry of the Troodos ophiolite, Cyprus: Sampling, chemical analysis and thermodynamic treatment

- Purpose and scope
  - Assess groundwater chemistry in the Troodos ophiolite to understand carbon dioxide saturation and mineral solubility reactions.
  - Focus on dissolved carbon dioxide (EpCO2) and mineral saturation indices to infer processes controlling groundwater composition.

- Study area and context
  - Location: Troodos ophiolite region of Cyprus, including Kyrenia Range (northern), Troodos Massif (center/south), and Mesaoria Plain (east-west extending plain).
  - Climate and terrain: typical Mediterranean climate; variation in rainfall and temperature with altitude; diverse geology across ranges and plain.
  - Water samples collected from major waters in the area to represent the hydrogeochemical regime.

- Sampling design and field procedures
  - 21 sampling sites within the Troodos ophiolite selected to represent major waters (streams, springs, boreholes).
  - Sampling carried out in mid-May 1985 with field coordination from the Geological Survey of Cyprus.
  - In-field handling: samples filtered through 0.45 μm membranes; pH measured electrochemically in the field with minimal atmospheric CO2 interaction.
  - Immediate analyses: alkalinity determined by acidimetric titration to pH ~4; reduced sulfur measured with an ion-selective electrode; rapid processing to minimize CO2 exchange and degassing.

- Laboratory analyses (UK-based)
  - Major anions, bromide, and total iodine (as iodide/iodate) by colorimetric methods.
  - Major cations, trace metals, and boron by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).
  - Sample preservation: metals stored in 1% v/v nitric acid; anions stored in clean glass bottles with high-purity water; some samples preserved for specific analyses in appropriate acids.
  - Data handling: CO2-related calculations (dissolved CO2, saturation conditions) performed afterReturn to the UK.

- Thermodynamic and speciation treatment
  - Dissolved CO2 approach (EpCO2): EpCO2 = dissolved CO2 in sample divided by dissolved CO2 in pure water in equilibrium with atmosphere at the same T and P; EpCO2 values interpreted as fractions of saturation (0.1, 1, 10 correspond to 0.1x, 1x, 10x atmospheric saturation).
  - Carbonate system and saturation calculations: ATK/PHREEQC thermodynamic model (Parkhurst, 1995) used to compute saturation indices for relevant minerals (e.g., calcium carbonate) and to evaluate the potential controls on Ca2+ and related species.
  - Saturation index (SICaCO3): SICaCO3 = log10({Ca2+}*{CO3^2-}) – log10(KCaCO3); 0 = saturation, +1 = tenfold supersaturation, -1 = tenfold undersaturation.
  - Other minerals: similar SI calculations applied for compounds such as Mg(OH)2 (brucite) using activity products; emphasis on using activities (not just concentrations) due to temperature, pressure, ionic strength effects.
  - Handling data below detection limits: when determinant values fall below the lowest quotable value, saturation indices are estimated using half of the lowest quotable value; italics in tables denote such cases and are explained in headings.

- Key methodological notes and references
  - Employed established methods for pH, alkalinity, and trace constituents; strict sample handling to minimize atmospheric interaction and degassing.
  - PHREEQC used for thermodynamic calculations, with explicit attention to temperature, pressure, and ionic strength.
  - Cited methodological foundations: Neal et al. (1988, 1992, 1998a) for bicarbonate and CO2 concepts; Pantazis (1978) for regional hydrogeology; Parkhurst (1995) for PHREEQC usage.

- Data presentation and interpretation
  - Results organized in tabular form (with below-detection data indicated in italics where applicable).
  - Tables accompany detailed methodological explanations and notes on how SI values were derived when data were at detection limits.
  - Emphasizes interpretation of CO2 saturation and mineral solubility relationships to understand groundwater evolution in the Troodos environment.

- Implications for monitoring and environmental health frameworks
  - Demonstrates a structured approach to selecting and measuring key groundwater health indicators (pH, alkalinity, CO2, major ions, trace metals, boron) and interpreting them via thermodynamic modeling.
  - Shows how to assess carbonate buffering, CO2 sources/inputs, and mineral precipitation/dissolution pathways, informing decisions on monitoring priorities and data quality requirements.
  - Highlights the importance of robust data handling (filtration, field measurements, sample preservation) and the use of standardized analytical and modeling tools to enable comparability and reproducibility.
  - While data governance details are not the focus, the document underscores the need for careful metadata, transparent methodologies, and clear communication of uncertainties, particularly when dealing with values near detection limits.
