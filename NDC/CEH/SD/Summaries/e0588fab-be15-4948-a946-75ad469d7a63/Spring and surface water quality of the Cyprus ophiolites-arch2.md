# Sampling, chemical analysis and thermodynamic treatment of waters from the Troodos ophiolite, Cyprus

## Overview and study area
- Cyprus location and geography: three main regions—Kyrenia Range (north), Troodos Massif (central/south-east), and Mesaoria Plain (east-west); diverse geology and soil types.
- Climate and hydrology: typical Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters; rainfall varies by region (Kyrenia ~500 mm, Troodos higher elevations up to ~1000 mm, Mesaoria ~350 mm); altitude-related temperature and snow in high Troodos.
- Population and land use: low population density outside major towns; agriculture (potatoes, grapes, citrus, olives) and expanding light industry; mining in Troodos (copper, asbestos, iron pyrite, chromite) in decline.
- Soils and terrain: peaty, shallow soils in mountains; stony soils on slopes; coniferous forests in higher areas.

## Study design and sampling
- Sampling scope: 21 sites within the Troodos ophiolite area selected to represent major watersheds, as previously identified by the Geological Survey of Cyprus.
- Sampling timing: mid-May 1985.
- Field assistance and coordination: conducted with local Geological Survey input.

## Laboratory analyses and sample handling
- Field procedures: samples filtered through 0.45 μm membranes; in-field pH measurement with minimal atmospheric contact to reduce CO2 exchange.
- Immediate analyses: alkalinity determined acidimetrically to pH ~4.0; reduced sulfur measured with an ion-selective electrode.
- Sample preservation and storage: samples returned to the UK for further analysis; cation, trace metal, and boron analyses by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES); major anions, bromide, and total iodine measured by colorimetric methods.
- Sample preparation: strict cleaning and preservation protocols (acid-washed bottles, nitric acid preservation for metals) to maintain sample integrity.

## Thermodynamic treatment and data analysis
- Dissolved carbon dioxide (EpCO2): calculated to assess CO2 saturation relative to atmospheric equilibrium, using pH, calcium, and alkalinity data; EpCO2 indicates degrees of saturation (0.1, 1, 10 represent tenth saturation, equilibrium, and tenfold saturation, respectively).
- Mineral saturation and controls: evaluated via saturation indices (SI) to assess solubility controls, using activity-based expressions (e.g., SI for calcium carbonate, SICaCO3 = log10({Ca2+}*{CO3^2-}) - log10(KCaCO3)).
- Example and methodology: calcium carbonate solubility and brucite (Mg(OH)2) saturation used to illustrate the approach; indices computed with temperature, pressure, and ionic strength considerations.
- Modelling tool: PHREEQC thermodynamic model (Parkhurst 1995) employed to calculate saturation indices.
- Handling data below detection limits: when determinands fall below the lowest quotable value, half the lowest quotable value is used for comparison; italics in tables indicate such cases; lowest quotable value defined as twice the detection limit (noting that for Al and Mg, upper bounds may apply due to equation structure).

## Outputs and reporting
- Results presented in tabular form (tables not included here), detailing dissolved species, CO2 saturation, and mineral saturation indices to interpret solubility controls in Troodos waters.
- Emphasis on standardised data collection, quality assurance, and data processing to enable future environmental monitoring and interpretation of groundwater chemistry in the region.
