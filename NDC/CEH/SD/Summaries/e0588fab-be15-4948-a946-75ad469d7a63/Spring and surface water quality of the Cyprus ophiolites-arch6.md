# Sampling, chemical analysis and thermodynamic treatment

- Location and context
  - Cyprus in the north-eastern Mediterranean; major geological regions include the Kyrenia Range (north/east coast), Troodos Massif (central/southeast), and the Mesaoria Plain (eastern-western). Troodos hosts ultrabasic ophiolite geology; climate is typical Mediterranean (hot, dry summers; cool, wet winters) with substantial variation by altitude.
  - Population density is low outside main towns; land use includes cultivation (potatoes, grapes, citrus, olives) and growing light industry; mining (copper, asbestos, iron pyrite, chromite) is declining. Soils are shallow, stony on slopes, with peat in mountains.

- Sampling design and field procedures
  - 21 sites within the Troodos ophiolite were sampled in mid-May 1985 to characterize major waters, following guidance from the Geological Survey of Cyprus.
  - Field methods: samples filtered through 0.45 μm membranes; pH measured in the field with a combination electrode while minimizing atmospheric CO2 contact; rapid handling for alkalinity (acidimetric titration to pH ~4) and reduced sulfur (ion-selective electrode) to limit CO2 exchange and degassing.
  - Sample handling: samples returned to the UK for extensive chemical analyses; containers prepared to minimize contamination and preserve integrity.

- Laboratory analyses and data handling
  - Analytical suite conducted in the UK using colorimetric methods for major anions, bromide, and total iodine; major cations, trace metals, and boron analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).
  - Sample preservation: metals stored in bottles acidified with 1% v/v HNO3; anions stored in glass bottles cleaned for high-purity water; dissolved CO2 and related species treated with care to avoid atmospheric exchange.
  - Quality considerations: analyses guided by methods from Neal et al. and Parkhurst; data tables include notes where detection limits affect interpretation (lowest quotable values) and use substitutions (e.g., values set at half the lowest quotable value) when necessary; italics indicate cases where the lowest quotable value is an issue.

- Thermodynamic treatment and data products
  - Dissolved carbon dioxide (EpCO2): EpCO2 calculated using pH, alkalinity, and carbonate system speciation to compare dissolved CO2 with atmospheric equilibrium; EpCO2 values expressed as fractions or multiples of atmospheric saturation (0.1, 1, 10 correspond to tenth, saturation, and tenfold saturation).
  - Mineral saturation indices: evaluated using saturation indices (SIs) to assess potential mineral solubility controls (e.g., calcite for CaCO3). SI = log10(activity product) – log10(K) for the relevant mineral; zero indicates saturation, +1 indicates tenfold supersaturation, -1 indicates tenfold undersaturation.
  - Specific examples: CaCO3 saturation index SICaCO3 uses the activity product {Ca2+}*{CO3^2-}; brucite saturation involves magnesium and hydroxide activities with the appropriate K for Mg(OH)2.
  - Computational approach: PHREEQC thermodynamic model (Parkhurst, 1995) used to compute saturation indices; in cases where data were below detection limits, half of the lowest quotable value was used to approximate indices; such cases are noted in tables (italics).
  - Data presentation: results organized in tabular form (and described in accompanying sections); some determinations have detection-limit caveats, particularly aluminium and magnesium, which affect upper-bound interpretations of saturation.
