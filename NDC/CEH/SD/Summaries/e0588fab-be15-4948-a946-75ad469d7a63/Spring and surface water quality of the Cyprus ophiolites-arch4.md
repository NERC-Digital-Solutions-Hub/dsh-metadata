# Location

- Cyprus overview: located in the north-eastern Mediterranean, near Turkey, Syria, and Egypt; island dimensions about 100 km by 230 km.

- Topography and geology: three regions
  - Kyrenia Range: northern/northeastern coastal range, up to ~910 m, limestone with flysch deposits.
  - Troodos Massif: large eastern/southern area, up to ~1940 m at Mount Olympus, full ophiolite sequence forming a dome-like structure; ultrabasic core exposed centrally; surrounding foothills are chalks (Cretaceous to Miocene).
  - Mesaoria Plain: east-west plain with sediments from Pliocene to recent; elevation <300 m.

- Climate and environment: typical Mediterranean climate; hot, dry summers; cool, wet winters; rainfall varies by region (Kyrenia ~500 mm, Troodos up to ~1000 mm at high altitudes, Mesaoria ~350 mm); snow possible on Troodos peaks.

- Population and land use: low population density outside towns and Nicosia; ~17% of land under cultivation; mining of copper, asbestos, iron pyrite, chromite in Troodos in decline; soils are peaty, shallow, and stony in mountainous areas; forestry with pine, cypress, cedar in higher areas.

- Sampling, chemical analysis and thermodynamic treatment (method summary)
  - Field sampling: 21 sites within the Troodos ophiolite area sampled in mid-May 1985; sites chosen with Geological Survey of Cyprus; samples filtered in the field through 0.45 μm membranes; pH measured on-site with a combination electrode minimizing atmospheric CO2 contact.
  - In-field and rapid processing: alkalinity determined by acidimetric titration to pH ~4.0; reduced sulfur measured with an ion-selective electrode; rapid analyses for alkalinity and sulfide to minimize CO2 exchange and contamination.
  - Sample handling: samples returned to the UK for further analysis; metals preserved with 1% v/v nitric acid; anions preserved in high-purity water-cleaned glass bottles; cations, trace metals, boron analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).
  - Analytical methods (UK): colorimetric determinations for major anions, bromide, and total iodine; ICP-OES for major cations, trace metals, boron; strict cleaning/preparation protocols for containers and reagents to avoid contamination; documentation of storage and preservation procedures.
  - Data interpretation and thermodynamics: dissolved CO2 (EpCO2) assessed using pH, alkalinity, and calcium data to derive bicarbonate, carbonate, calcium-carbonate, and calcium-bicarbonate species; EpCO2 defined as the ratio of dissolved CO2 in sample to CO2 in pure water in equilibrium with the atmosphere at the same temperature/pressure; EpCO2 values interpreted as sub-saturation (0.1), saturation (1), or supra-saturation (10).
  - Mineral saturation and modeling: saturation indices calculated to assess solubility controls (e.g., calcium carbonate); SICaCO3 defined as log10 activity product minus log10 KCaCO3; zero indicates saturation; positive/negative values indicate oversaturation/undersaturation; brucite (Mg(OH)2) saturation index calculated with a specified activity formulation for Mg2+ and OH-; all calculations performed with the PHREEQC thermodynamic model.
  - Handling of data below detection: in cases where determinands fall below the lowest quotable value, saturation indices computed with half of the lowest quotable value; italics and table headings explain such cases; lowest quotable value defined as twice the detection limit; note that for aluminum and magnesium, these are upper bounds on saturation estimates.
  - References and methodology: analysis and interpretation rely on Neal (1988, 1992, 1998a), Pantazis (1978), Parkhurst (1995), and related works; PHREEQC (Parkhurst, 1995) used for speciation and saturation calculations.

- Data presentation and reproducibility
  - Data are organized in tabular form (details provided in later sections of the document).
  - Methodology emphasizes reproducibility through explicit sampling procedures, preservation protocols, and transparent thermodynamic calculations (EpCO2 and saturation indices) using established literature and the PHREEQC model.

- Overall purpose
  - To document field sampling, laboratory analyses, and thermodynamic calculations used to evaluate groundwater chemistry, CO2 dynamics, and mineral saturation in the Troodos ophiolite region of Cyprus.
