# Background, Experiment Design and Analytical Methods

- Purpose and scope
  - Summary of a dataset used in Harper et al. (2018) to study carbon cycle implications of land-use change for Paris climate targets.
  - Combines JULES land surface modeling (v4.8) with a multi-layer soil carbon model and the IMOGEN climate–carbon cycle emulator.
  - Uses 6 simulation sets representing combinations of temperature pathways and land-use scenarios to explore BECCS and forest regrowth/conservation effects.
- Modeling framework
  - JULES (global land surface model) run in an inverted IMOGEN configuration to emulate climate–carbon outcomes.
  - IMOGEN uses pattern scaling to reflect 34 CMIP5 GCMs; prescribed temperature pathways drive simulations.
- Experimental design (six simulation configurations, 12 runs)
  - Temperature pathways:
    - 2deg: stabilisation at 2°C by 2100
    - 1p5deg: stabilisation at 1.5°C by 2100
    - 2deg_1p5CO2: 2°C climate with CO2 from the 1.5°C scenario to isolate climate vs CO2 effects
  - Land-use scenarios:
    - IM19: IMAGE SSP2-SPA0-RCP1.9
    - IM26: IMAGE SSP2-SPA2-RCP2.6
  - Resulting directory structure for outputs:
    - 1p5deg_IM19, 1p5deg_IM26, 2deg_IM19, 2deg_IM26, 2deg_IM19_1p5CO2, 2deg_IM26_1p5CO2
- Data products and time coverage
  - Outputs cover 2000–2099; earlier years (1850–1999) are stored in linked datasets.
  - Variables span carbon stocks, soil carbon, vegetation dynamics, BECCS pools, crop fractions, NPP, and water/energy cycle components.
- Linked datasets and access
  - CMIP5 GCM outputs used to drive JULES-IMOGEN (linked via EIDC DOIs).
  - Historical period data (1850–2000) available from linked dataset.
  - File naming conventions:
    - BL_CEN_<centre>_MOD_<model>_<scenario>.CarbonStocks.2000-2099.nc
    - BL_CEN_<centre>_MOD_<model>_<scenario>.WaterCycle.2000-2099.nc
  - Scenario identifiers in file names correspond to the three temperature pathways ('2deg', '1p5deg', '2deg_IM19/IM26' with optional _1p5CO2).
- Variables and data structure
  - CarbonStocks group includes:
    - cv: gridbox total vegetation carbon (kg m-2)
    - cs_gb: gridbox total soil carbon (kg m-2)
    - frac: fractional cover of each surface type (1)
    - npp: net primary productivity (kg m-2 s-1) per PFT
    - harvest: harvest on crop tiles (kg m-2 s-1)
    - ccs_gb: BECCS pool carbon (kg m-2)
    - Frac_agr, Frac_biocrop, Frac_past: fractional area of crops, bioenergy crops, pasture
    - wood_products: wood product carbon pools
    - co2_ppmv: CO2 concentration (ppmv)
  - WaterCycle group includes:
    - t_soil: soil temperature by layer (K)
    - smcl: soil moisture by layer (kg m-2)
    - Swet_tot: soil moisture fraction
    - Fqw_gb: surface moisture flux (kg m-2 s-1)
    - Ftl_gb: sensible heat flux (W m-2)
    - fwetl: wetland fraction
    - runoff: surface runoff (kg m-2 s-1)
    - zw: depth to water table (m)
- Spatial structure and weighting
  - Each grid box consists of 17 tiles (13 plant functional types + 4 non-vegetated tiles).
  - NPP and other grid-box totals require weighting by frac to account for within-gridbox composition.
- Ancillary files and model setup
  - Ancillary files needed to run rose suites for JULES-IMOGEN (grid info, ordering, boundary conditions, CO2 concentrations, non-CO2 radiative forcing, land cover, initial conditions).
  - Key ancillary items include:
    - grid_info.nc, imogen_order.dat, points.all.dat
    - SSP2.6_IMAGE_concs_co2.txt and related CO2/CH4/N2O files
    - Land-cover files for IM1.9 and IM2.6 scenarios
    - Initial condition files for each GCM and temperature scenario
- File access and documentation
  - NetCDF files are self-describing and readable with standard tools (R, Python, NCO, etc.).
  - Directory structure organized by land-use and CO2 experiment; Appendix lists the climate modeling centers and GCM names used (CMIP5-based).
  - Data and related publications provide context and methodology (Harper et al. 2018; Comyn-Platt et al. 2018; IMOGEN and JULES references).
- Practical notes for GIS use
  - Use time, latitude, longitude dimensions to create temporal GIS layers for 2000–2099.
  - For grid-box totals (e.g., NPP, carbon stocks), apply weighting by frac to obtain accurate map-level sums.
  - The dataset enables map-based visualization of:
    - Vegetation and soil carbon stocks
    - BECCS carbon pools
    - Land-cover fractions (crops, bioenergy crops, pasture)
    - NPP dynamics by PFT
    - Water-cycle and energy-budget components (soil temperature/moisture, fluxes, runoff)
- Reproducibility and references
  - Described dataset underpins publications by Harper et al. (2018) and related works (e.g., Comyn-Platt et al., 2018).
