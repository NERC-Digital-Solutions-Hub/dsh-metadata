# Radionuclide transfer to milk: Data compilation, transfer coefficients, and sources

- Context
  - A database was created to handle and process information drawn from diverse sources (books, journals, conference proceedings, institutional reports, and databases).
  - Entries were individually reviewed, revised, and supplemented with additional data from English and Russian literature (notably Fesenko et al., 2007).
- Data processing and quality
  - Data were quality assured, cleaned, and transformed before inclusion in the database.
  - When data were sufficient, transfer table values were provided for each element, including:
    - Number of data points
    - Geometric mean (GM)
    - Geometric standard deviation (GSD)
    - Arithmetic mean
    - Standard deviation
  - For radionuclides with limited data (single value), only the arithmetic mean value is reported.
- Transfer metrics and units
  - Cow milk transfer coefficient (Fm) is defined as the ratio of element concentration in cow milk to element daily intake; reported as GM_DL-1 with units days per litre.
  - Cow milk concentration ratio (CR) is the equilibrium ratio of element concentration in milk to concentration in feed; GM and GSD reported (units not applicable).
  - Goat milk transfer coefficient (Fm) and concentration ratio (CR) are defined similarly to cow milk metrics.
  - For both cow and goat milk, the number of data points (N) is reported (where available).
- Elements and radionuclides covered
  - Elements listed with explanations: Ag, Am, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cs, Fe, I, Mn, Na, P, Pb, Pu, Ru, Se, Sr, U, Y, Zn, Zr.
- Data fields and terminology
  - Cow_milk_Fm_GM_DL-1: Geometric mean of cow milk transfer coefficient (Fm) for each element; units DL-1 (days per litre).
  - Cow_milk_Fm_GSD_DL-1: Geometric standard deviation for Cow_milk_Fm_GM_DL-1.
  - Cow_milk_CR_GM: Geometric mean of cow milk concentration ratio (CR).
  - Cow_milk_CR_GSD: Geometric standard deviation of CR.
  - Cow_milk_N: Number of cow milk data points per element.
  - Goat_milk_Fm_GM_DL-1, Goat_milk_Fm_GSD_DL-1: Analogous metrics for goat milk.
  - Goat_milk_CR_GM, Goat_milk_CR_GSD: Ratios and spread for goat milk.
  - Goat_milk_N: Number of goat milk data points per element.

- Purpose and outputs
  - Standardised data outputs (tables, figures, and charts) to support monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Ensures datasets are stored and accessible via appropriate portals for broad use.
- Challenges and goals for analysts
  - Increase the value of monitoring datasets by combining them with other relevant data (avoiding single-use datasets).
  - Improve accessibility of underlying data used to produce final outputs, enabling broader scrutiny and reuse.
