# Radionuclide transfer to milk: data compilation and transfer tables

- Purpose and scope
  - Compilation of information from books, journals, conference proceedings, institutional reports, and international/national databases to study radionuclide transfer to milk.
  - Creation of a database to handle and process data from diverse sources, with entries reviewed and revised as needed and supplemented by new source data.

- Data collection and sources
  - English-language literature searches plus a major review of relevant Russian-language documents (Fesenko et al., 2007), with findings published as peer-reviewed papers.
  - Data gathered to support transferable metrics for milk (cow and goat) and to document data provenance.

- Data handling and quality
  - Where data are sufficient, the database provides: number of data points, geometric mean (GM), geometric standard deviation (GSD), arithmetic mean, and standard deviation.
  - For radionuclides with limited documentation and a single value, only the value appears in the arithmetic mean column.

- Milk transfer metrics and units
  - Cow milk transfer coefficient (Fm): GM_DL-1, calculated as element concentration in milk divided by element daily intake; units are days per litre (DL-1).
  - Cow milk transfer coefficient standard deviation (F m_GSD_DL-1): GM SD in the same units.
  - Cow milk concentration ratio (CR): GM and GSD representing the equilibrium ratio of element concentration in milk to that in feed; GM and GSD units are not applicable.
  - Data quantity indicator: Cow_milk_N (number of cow milk data for each element).
  - Goat milk equivalents: Goat_milk_Fm_GM_DL-1, Goat_milk_Fm_GSD_DL-1, Goat_milk_CR_GM, Goat_milk_CR_GSD, Goat_milk_N.
  - Elements covered (examples): Ag, Am, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cs, Fe, I, Mn, Na, P, Pb, Pu, Ru, Se, Sr, U, Y, Zn, Zr.
  - Note: All listed elements have explanations and are reported as either transfer coefficients (Fm) or concentration ratios (CR); units are not applicable for CR.

- Data coverage and structure
  - Data are organized by milk type (cow and goat) with corresponding Fm and CR metrics, enabling cross-species comparison and assessment of data gaps.
  - Includes explicit naming conventions for entries (e.g., Cow_milk_Fm_GM_DL-1, Cow_milk_CR_GM) to support discoverability and reuse.
