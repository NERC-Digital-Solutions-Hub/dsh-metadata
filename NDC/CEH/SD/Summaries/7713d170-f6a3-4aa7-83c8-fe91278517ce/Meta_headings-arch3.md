# Transfer to Milk of Radionuclides in Cattle and Goats

- Purpose and scope
  - Compiles environmental health data to support monitoring framework work: assessing radionuclide transfer to milk for policy scrutiny and decision-making.
  - Focuses on transfer to cow and goat milk, enabling evaluation of exposure pathways through dairy products.

- Information sources and data compilation
  - Reviewed books, journals, conference proceedings, institutional reports, and international/national databases.
  - Created a dedicated database to handle and process data from multiple sources; entries reviewed and revised as needed and supplemented with new data.
  - Major inclusion of Russian-language studies via a Russian-language review (Fesenko et al., 2007) alongside English-language literature.
  - Data and metadata are curated to enable traceability and quality assessment.

- Data outputs and metrics
  - When data are sufficient: provide number of data points, geometric mean (GM), geometric standard deviation (GSD), arithmetic mean (AM), and standard deviation (SD) in transfer tables.
  - For less well-documented radionuclides with a single value: report only the arithmetic mean.
  - Key metrics and datasets
    - Cow_milk_Fm_GM_DL-1: geometric mean of cow milk transfer coefficient (Fm) in days per litre.
    - Cow_milk_Fm_GSD_DL-1: geometric standard deviation for Cow Fm.
    - Cow_milk_CR_GM: geometric mean of cow milk concentration ratio (CR) (milk/feed).
    - Cow_milk_CR_GSD: geometric SD for Cow CR.
    - Cow_milk_N: number of cow milk data points for each element.
    - Goat_milk_Fm_GM_DL-1, Goat_milk_Fm_GSD_DL-1: analogous goat milk Fm metrics.
    - Goat_milk_CR_GM, Goat_milk_CR_GSD: analogous goat milk CR metrics.
    - Goat_milk_N: number of goat milk data points.
  - Elements included (examples): Ag, Am, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cs, Fe, I, Mn, Na, P, Pb, Pu, Ru, Se, Sr, U, Y, Zn, Zr.
  - Units: Fm units are days per litre (DL-1); CR and other metrics are reported as dimensionless or not applicable where appropriate.

- Relevance for monitoring and policy
  - Establishes standardized transfer coefficients and concentration ratios to support risk assessment, regulatory benchmarks, and monitoring designs for dairy products.
  - Enables cross-species comparisons (cow vs goat) and evaluation of data quality through metadata (N, GM, GSD, etc.).
  - Provides a basis for model calibration, data governance considerations, and transparency in the data used for environmental health decisions.

- Practical considerations for implementation
  - Data gaps and variability across radionuclides; some datasets may have limited metadata or single-value entries.
  - Importance of data sharing considerations and metadata completeness to improve usability in monitoring frameworks.
