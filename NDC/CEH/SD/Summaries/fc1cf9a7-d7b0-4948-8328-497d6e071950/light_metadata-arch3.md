# Light penetration for determination of the euphotic zone in Durleigh Reservoir, 2018

## Overview
- Dataset describing light penetration measurements used to determine the euphotic zone in Durleigh Reservoir during 2018.
- Data collected to support environmental health monitoring and understanding of primary production in the reservoir.

## Data collection and methods
- Instrumentation: HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light 8K Loggers.
- Depths (measurement locations): 0.5 m, 1.5 m, 2.5 m in the water column.
- Temporal resolution: measurements every 10 minutes.
- Light units: lum/ft^2; temperatures reported in oF.
- Date-time format: mm/dd/yyyy HH:MM:SS.
- Deployment period: 30 May 2018 to 5 Oct 2018.
- Location coordinates: latitude 51.1210, longitude -3.0403.
- File naming convention: files include the depth, e.g., '0.5mPENDANT.csv' for the 0.5 m pendant.
- Data collection conducted by: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.

## Data attributes and metadata
- Depth-specific light intensity data with corresponding temperature readings.
- Descriptive metadata included in filenames and within the dataset for provenance.
- Data format and units clearly specified to facilitate reuse and integration with other monitoring efforts.

## Data management and governance
- Dataset authorship and citation provided (Slavin and Wain, 2018).
- Emphasizes the importance of data quality, provenance, and clear metadata to enable verification and reuse.
- Public sharing of underlying data may be a consideration or barrier, aligning with common governance concerns in monitoring frameworks.
