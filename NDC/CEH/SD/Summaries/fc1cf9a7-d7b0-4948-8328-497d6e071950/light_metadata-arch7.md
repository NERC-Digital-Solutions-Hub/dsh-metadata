# Light penetration for determination of the euphotic zone in Durleigh Reservoir, 2018

- Overview: Metadata file documenting light penetration measurements to determine the euphotic zone in Durleigh Reservoir for 2018.
- Data collection method: Light intensity through the water column measured with HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light 8K Loggers.
- Depths (measurement locations): 0.5 m, 1.5 m, and 2.5 m below the water surface.
- Location: Latitude 51.1210, Longitude -3.0403.
- File naming convention: Data files named to indicate depth, e.g. '0.5mPENDANT.csv' for the pendant at 0.5 m depth.
- Variables and units:
  - Light intensity: lum/ft^2.
  - Temperature: °F (Fahrenheit).
  - Date-time format: mm/dd/yyyy HH:MM:SS.
- Temporal coverage: Measurements taken at 10-minute intervals between 30/05/2018 and 05/10/2018.
- Personnel: Pendants deployed by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
- Authors and citation: Slavin, E.I., and Wain, D.J. (2018). Please cite as Slavin and Wain (2018). Note: text also shows "Salvin" as a variant spelling in the citation line.
- Intended GIS use: Can be used to model light attenuation with depth, assist in deriving euphotic depth, and integrate with other spatial data (e.g., bathymetry, water quality) for GIS analyses of Durleigh Reservoir.
- provenance: Data accompanying a study to determine the euphotic zone; supports map-based data products and analysis for decision-making.
