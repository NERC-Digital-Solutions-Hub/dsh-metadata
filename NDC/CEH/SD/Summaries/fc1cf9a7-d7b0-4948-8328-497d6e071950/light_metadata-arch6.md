# Light penetration for determination of the euphotic zone in Durleigh Reservoir, 2018

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset records light penetration through the Durleigh Reservoir water column to determine the euphotic zone.
  - Measurements intended to quantify light intensity at multiple depths to assess penetration.

- Instruments and variables
  - Light intensity measured with HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light 8K Loggers.
  - Temperature readings also recorded (reported in Fahrenheit).
  - Depths sampled: 0.5 m, 1.5 m, and 2.5 m.
  - Light units: lum/ft^2; temperature units: °F.

- Location and deployment
  - Deployment site coordinates: latitude 51.1210, longitude -3.0403.
  - Pendants deployed by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
  - Deployment period: 30 May 2018 to 5 October 2018.

- Data structure and format
  - Data files are organized by depth, with filenames including depth (e.g., '0.5mPENDANT.csv').
  - Time format: mm/dd/yyyy HH:MM:SS.
  - Measurements recorded at 10-minute intervals.
