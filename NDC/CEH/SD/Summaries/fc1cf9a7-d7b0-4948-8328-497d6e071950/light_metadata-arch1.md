# Light penetration for determination of the euphotic zone in Durleigh Reservoir, 2018

## Overview
- Dataset documenting light penetration through Durleigh Reservoir water column in 2018.
- Light intensity measured with HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light 8K Loggers to aid determination of the euphotic zone.
- Deployment included three depth positions (0.5 m, 1.5 m, 2.5 m) at the given location.

## Data collection details
- Equipment: HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light 8K Loggers (also records temperature).
- Depths and file naming: measurements stored in files named by depth (e.g., 0.5mPENDANT.csv).
- Deployment team: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
- Timeframe: 30 May 2018 to 5 October 2018.
- Location: latitude 51.1210, longitude -3.0403.
- Sampling interval: every 10 minutes.

## Variables and units
- Light intensity: measured in lum/ft².
- Temperature: reported in degrees Fahrenheit (°F).
- Date/time format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS.
- Data organization: separate CSV files corresponding to each depth.

## Data structure and usage notes
- Depth-specific files: 0.5mPENDANT.csv, 1.5mPENDANT.csv, 2.5mPENDANT.csv.
- Metadata includes authors and citation guidance.
- Primary purpose: determine the euphotic zone depth from light penetration data.

## Temporal and spatial coverage
- Temporal coverage: 30 May 2018 to 5 October 2018.
- Spatial focus: Durleigh Reservoir at the specified coordinates.

## Potential analyses and applications
- Calculate euphotic depth by analyzing light intensity with depth and time.
- Examine diurnal and seasonal patterns in light penetration.
- Combine light data with temperature readings for ancillary environmental analyses.
- Use as a reproducible dataset for cross-site comparisons of photic zone characteristics.
