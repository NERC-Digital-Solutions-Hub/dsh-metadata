# Light penetration for determination of the euphotic zone in Durleigh Reservoir, 2018

## Overview
- This dataset documents light penetration measurements used to determine the euphotic zone in Durleigh Reservoir during 2018.
- Measurements were collected at multiple depths to profile light availability in the water column.

## Methods and instrumentation
- Instrumentation: HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light 8K Loggers.
- Depths sampled: 0.5 m, 1.5 m, and 2.5 m.
- Location: latitude 51.1210, longitude -3.0403.
- Deployment period: 30 May 2018 to 5 October 2018.
- Measurement cadence: every 10 minutes.
- File naming convention: filenames include the pendant depth, e.g., "0.5mPENDANT.csv".

## Data format and units
- Light intensity unit: lum/ft².
- Temperature unit: Fahrenheit (oF).
- Timestamp format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS.
- Data records include depth-specific files (e.g., 0.5mPENDANT.csv).

## Data provenance and authorship
- Authors: Emily I. Slavin and Danielle J. Wain.
- Publication/year citation: Slavin and Wain (2018). Light penetration for determination of the euphotic zone in Durleigh Reservoir, 2018.

## Outputs and intended use
- Purpose: support determination of the euphotic zone by analyzing light penetration profiles across depths.
- Typical outputs: datasets suitable for generating light profiles, enabling assessment of environmental light conditions.
- Outputs are intended to be presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Relevance to monitoring and data management
- Aligns with environmental monitoring aims to verify data quality, standardize outputs, and support policy/performance scrutiny over time.
- Encourages linking this dataset with other relevant environmental data to enhance value beyond single-use applications.
- Emphasizes accessibility of underlying data to support broader analysis and reuse.
