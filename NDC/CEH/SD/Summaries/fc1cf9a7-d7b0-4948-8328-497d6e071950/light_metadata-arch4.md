# Light penetration for determination of the euphotic zone in Durleigh Reservoir, 2018

## Overview
- Study goal: Determine the euphotic zone by measuring light penetration in Durleigh Reservoir during 2018.
- Instrumentation: HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light 8K Loggers.
- Deployment depths: 0.5 m, 1.5 m, and 2.5 m in the water column.
- Location: Durleigh Reservoir; coordinates lat 51.1210, lon -3.0403.
- Temporal coverage: 30 May 2018 to 5 Oct 2018.
- Sampling cadence: Every 10 minutes.
- File naming convention: Filenames include depth, e.g., '0.5mPENDANT.csv'.

## Data collection details
- Measures recorded: Light intensity (units: lum/ft²) and temperatures (units: °F).
- Date-time format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS.
- Deployers: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
- Authors: Slavin, E.I.; Wain, D.J.
- Dataset citation: Slavin and Wain (2018); shown as Slavin and Wain (2018) with a naming variant in the metadata (Salvin vs Slavin).

## Data structure and formats
- Data files are CSVs with light intensity and temperature readings at 10-minute intervals.
- Depth information is inferred from filename (e.g., 0.5mPENDANT.csv).

## Provenance and authorship
- Deployment personnel: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
- Primary authors: Slavin, E.I.; Wain, D.J.
- Citation guidance: Provided as Slavin and Wain (2018); metadata also lists Salvin, E.I., Wain, D.J. (potential inconsistency to resolve).

## Usage and reuse considerations
- Applicable for estimating the euphotic zone by correlating light penetration with depth-stratified measurements.
- Useful for cross-referencing with other optical or water-quality datasets to assess light climate in Durleigh Reservoir.
- Metadata includes units, depth-derived filename cues, and timestamp format to aid discovery and interoperability.

## Metadata and data quality considerations
- Clear depth tagging via filenames enhances discoverability and organization.
- Units specified (light in lum/ft²; temperature in °F) support consistent interpretation.
- Potential metadata note: ensure consistent author/citation entry across systems (Slavin vs Salvin).
- Guidance needed on data availability location, update cadence beyond the study period, and any data quality flags.

## Access and discoverability (context for data leaders)
- The dataset is described with explicit metadata fields (depth, location, time frame, cadence, units, filename convention).
- For better discoverability, store in a central data catalog with standardized metadata (including DOI or persistent identifier) and unify contributor names for citation stability.
