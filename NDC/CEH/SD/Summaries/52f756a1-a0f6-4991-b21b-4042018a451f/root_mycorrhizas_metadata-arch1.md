# AFEX Experiment

- Site: AFEX project area at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Climate: mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75%–92% across seasons.

- Experimental design: full factorial nutrient addition experiment with eight treatments and four replicates per treatment.
  - Treatments: control; N; P; cations (Ca, Mg, K); N+P; N+cations; N+P+cations.
  - Layout: 4 independent blocks with at least 250 m spacing; 32 plots total; plots sized 50 m × 50 m; measurements focused on a central 30 m × 30 m area per plot.

- Nutrient application rates (per year): N = 125 kg ha⁻¹ (as urea); P = 50 kg ha⁻¹ (as triple superphosphate); Ca = 50 kg ha⁻¹; Mg = 20 kg ha⁻¹ (as dolomitic limestone); K = 50 kg ha⁻¹ (as potassium chloride).

- Root sampling and measurement timeline:
  - In each plot (n=32), five ingrowth cores (12 cm diameter, 30 cm deep) with 2 cm plastic mesh bags were installed in August 2017 within the central 30 × 30 m area.
  - Cores were collected every three months; five cores per plot were homogenised by plot and soil depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; total N=64).
  - Fine roots produced in the interval November 2017–February 2018 were used; extraction occurred in 60-minute periods and extrapolated to 180 minutes using a Michaelis-Menten asymptotic curve to estimate total root biomass sampled (Metcalfe et al., 2007).

- Root subsampling and mycorrhizal colonisation:
  - Focused on fine roots in the 0–10 cm depth; mycorrhizal colonisation assessed from root tips (<1 mm) extracted from subsamples.
  - Cleared and stained using tropical-adapted protocols: clearing with 2.5% KOH, autoclaving ~120°C, bleaching with H2O2, acidifying with 2% HCl, and staining with Trypan Blue (0.05%).
  - Root fragments (10 per slide) examined under 40× magnification to determine the percentage of root length colonised by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (total colonisation).

- Data management and spreadsheet details:
  - Key fields include Block (1–4), Plot (1–8 per block), TRT (treatment description), and several AM colonisation metrics:
    - no_am: percentage of root length not colonised by AM
    - hyphae: percentage colonised by AM hyphae
    - hyphae_arbuscule: percentage with hyphae and arbuscules
    - hyphae_vesicle: percentage with hyphae and vesicles
    - hyphae_arb_ves: percentage with hyphae, arbuscules, and vesicles
    - total_col: total percentage of root length colonised by AM structures
