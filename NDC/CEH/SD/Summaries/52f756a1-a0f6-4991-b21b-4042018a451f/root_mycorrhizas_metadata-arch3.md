# AFEX Experiment at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA)

## Purpose and Context
- A full factorial nutrient addition experiment conducted to evaluate how different nutrients and their combinations influence below-ground processes in a tropical forest.
- Located in the AFEX project area, BDFFP/INPA, about 80 km north of Manaus, Brazil; characterized by mean temp ~26°C and mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm.
- Sampling focuses on root dynamics and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonisation as indicators of environmental health and nutrient limitation.

## Experimental Design
- Treatments: eight nutrient regimes including control, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), cations (K, Mg, Ca), and their combinations (N+P, N+cations, P+cations, N+P+cations).
- Replication: 4 independent blocks with 4 replicates per treatment (total 32 plots).
- Plot layout: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central 30 m × 30 m area used for main measurements; plots located with at least 250 m between blocks.
- Nutrient application: surface applications three times per year using dry granules.
  - Rates: 125 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ N (as urea), 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ P (as triple superphosphate), 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ Ca, 20 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ Mg (as dolomitic limestone), 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ K (as potassium chloride).

## Measurement and Sampling
- Root ingrowth cores
  - In each plot (n=32), five 12 cm-diameter, 30 cm-deep root-free ingrowth cores installed in August 2017 within the central 30 × 30 m area.
  - Cores collected every three months; homogenised by plot and soil depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; N=64).
  - Focused on fine roots produced between November 2017 and February 2018 (middle of the wet season).
  - Root biomass estimated by extrapolating 60 minutes of sampling using a Michaelis-Menten asymptotic curve to project 180 minutes of sampling (Metcalfe et al., 2007).

- Root subsampling and mycorrhizal assessment
  - Fine roots in the 0–10 cm depth subsampled for AM colonisation, targeting absorptive fine roots (<1 mm diameter).
  - AM colonisation quantified on root tips after cleaning, clearing, staining (Trypan Blue) and mounting.
  - Protocol adaptations for tropical roots include specific clearing, autoclaving, bleaching, acidification, and staining steps (Brundrett et al. 1984; Wurzburger & Wright 2015; McGonigle et al. 1990).
  - Colonisation measured as the percentage of root length with AM structures; data captured for various colonisation components (hyphae, arbuscules, vesicles).

## Data Management and Metadata
- Spreadsheet schema records:
  - Block, Plot, TRT (treatment), and descriptive fields for experimental design.
  - Measurements for no_am (non-colonised root length), hyphae, hyphae_arbuscule, hyphae_vesicle, hyphae_arb_ves, and total_col (overall colonisation).
  - Each variable includes a description clarifying what is measured (e.g., percentage of root length colonised by specific AM structures).
- Clear labeling supports traceability from block to plot to treatment, enabling reproducible monitoring and analysis.

## Timeline and Procedures
- Installation: August 2017 for ingrowth cores.
- Sampling: November 2017–February 2018 (wet season period) for root biomass and mycorrhizal assessment.
- Processing: 60-minute standardized root sampling, with extrapolation to 180 minutes for biomass estimates; microscopy-based assessment for colonisation.

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates integration of ecological indicators (root biomass, AM colonisation) into a structured monitoring design with clear treatments and replication.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Robust metadata and standardized data schemas for traceability and reuse.
  - Transparent, repeatable measurement protocols (sampling intervals, root depth, and staining methods).
  - Data quality considerations, including explicit measurement definitions and documentation of analytical methods (e.g., Michaelis-Menten extrapolation for biomass).
- Illustrates potential governance and operational considerations for monitoring programs:
  - Data sharing and openness via well-documented datasets (e.g., metadata completeness, dataset provenance).
  - The need for consistent data management practices across plots, treatments, and time points to enable clear reporting and decision-making.
- Addresses typical challenges relevant to monitoring frameworks:
  - Ensuring adequate metadata and standardization to verify data meet requirements.
  - Handling data transformation needs due to measurement techniques and intervals.
  - Communicating complex ecological findings clearly, through structured outputs (e.g., dashboards or reports) aligned with governance processes.
