# AFEX Experiment at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/ INPA)

## Location and climate context
- Conducted at the AFEX project area within the BDFFP (INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil (02°25'S, 59°43'W).
- Climate: mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75%–92% across seasons.

## Experimental design
- Full factorial nutrient addition with eight treatments: Control; N; P; Cations (Ca, Mg, K); N+P; N+Cations; N+P+Cations.
- 4 replicate plots per treatment (total 32 plots) arranged in 4 independent blocks with at least 250 m between blocks.
- Each plot 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m.
- Nutrients applied three times per year with the following rates:
  - N: 125 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as urea)
  - P: 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as triple superphosphate)
  - Ca: 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹
  - Mg: 20 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as dolomitic limestone)
  - K: 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (as potassium chloride)

## Field methods: root sampling
- In each plot (n=32), install five 12 cm diameter, 30 cm deep ingrowth cores (in 2 cm plastic mesh bags) in the central 30 m × 30 m area starting August 2017.
- Collect cores every three months; homogenize five core replicates by plot and soil depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; N=64).
- Use fine roots produced in the interval Nov 2017–Feb 2018 (wet season) for analysis.
- Root biomass extrapolation: after 60 minutes of sampling, apply Michaelis–Menten asymptotic curve to estimate biomass for a 180-minute sampling period (Metcalfe et al., 2007).

## Field methods: mycorrhizal colonisation
- Focus on fine roots in the 0–10 cm depth.
- Subsamples cleaned, cleared, and stained following tropical-root protocols (Brundrett et al. 1984; Wurzburger & Wright 2015).
- Clearing: 2.5% KOH; autoclave ~120°C for ~10 min; bleaching with H2O2 ~30 min.
- Acidify in 2% HCl for 30 min; stain with Trypan Blue 0.05% for 30 min; mount 1 cm root fragments for 40x microscopy.
- Quantify the percentage of root length colonised by AM fungi (mycorrhizal structures).

## Data and metadata management
- Spreadsheet fields include:
  - Block (1–4), Plot (1–8 within each block), TRT (treatment description).
  - Root colonisation metrics: no_am; hyphae; hyphae_arbuscule; hyphae_vesicle; hyphae_arb_ves; total_col.
- Documentation links plot/block descriptions with treatment details; enables tracking of replication and depth-specific measurements.

## References (methodology context)
- Key methodological sources for root and AM fungal assessment, including:
  - Metcalfe et al. 2007 (ingrowth core sampling and extrapolation)
  - Brundrett et al. 1984; McGonigle et al. 1990; McCormack et al. 2015; Wurzburger & Wright 2015

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized, repeatable measurements of below-ground responses to nutrient additions in a tropical forest setting.
- Data are structured for cross-comparison across treatments, plots, depths, and time points, supporting long-term environmental health assessments and policy-relevant analyses.
- Data management approach emphasizes quality assurance, clear metadata, and readiness for sharing and portal deposition.

## Practical challenges and data-use considerations
- Opportunity to enhance dataset value by integrating with additional environmental variables (e.g., soil chemistry, above-ground productivity) to enable broader ecosystem insight.
- Emphasis on making underlying data accessible to inform external stakeholders and comparative studies.
