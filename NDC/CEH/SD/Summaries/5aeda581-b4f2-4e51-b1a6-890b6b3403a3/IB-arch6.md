# IB Protocol

## Aim and Rationale
- Monitor the abundance of butterflies using transect methods aligned with the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS).
- Leverages ~15 years of prior sampling for comparison and context.
- Builds on established links between butterfly populations, vegetation abundance/quality, and climate to support ecological understanding and monitoring.

## Method and Location
- A fixed transect route is established at each site and followed consistently; routes may follow existing paths or boundaries and should be representative of the ECN site.
- Transect length typically 1–2 km and should be walkable in 30–90 minutes; divided into up to 15 sections to capture different habitats or management regimes.
- Changes in habitat or management near the transect are recorded to aid result interpretation.
- Recording occurs weekly from 1 April to 29 September, 10:45–15:45 BST (weather permitting; temperature guidelines apply).
- Transects should be conducted by someone with good knowledge of British butterfly fauna; multiple recorders can be useful during peak activity.

## Data Collection Details
- Data collected: number of butterflies seen flying within or passing through a 5 m wide, 5 m high, 5 m in front of the observer box; recorded by species for each transect section.
- For each transect, record start time, temperature at end, percentage sunshine, and wind speed at end (BST, 24-h clock; wind speed in Beaufort scale; precision notes included).
- Temperature thresholds: recording possible if temperature is at least 13–17°C with 60% sunshine; at higher temperatures, recording is allowed in any conditions provided it is not raining; northern upland sites may have a max of 15°C.
- Optional: more than one recorder to share workload during peak periods.

## Data Structure and Formats
- Core dataset identifiers (must be included in all datasets):
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time
- Core measurement: invertebrates – butterflies (IB Protocol); data submitted to ECNCCU; documentation available via restricted extranet.
- Weekly data variables (for each transect recording):
  - Recording date/time, start time
  - Temperature at end, percentage sunshine (with units)
  - Wind speed at end
- For each transect section:
  - Transect section number
  - Species code and name
  - Number seen
  - Habitat description (numeric code 1–15)
  - BMS code and common name
  - Habitat description and counts may include precision details as per BMS conventions
- Data formats and transfer: refer to accompanying Data Transfer documentation available on the restricted access Site Managers' extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

## Recording Conventions and Tools
- Use standard BMS coding; habitat should be described per the BMS handbook to aid interpretation.
- It is useful to note plant species likely important as butterfly food sources or nectar sources (e.g., nettles, violets, thistles, teasels) to contextualize results, though the aim is not precise plant abundance quantification.
- Recording forms: a standard BMS recording form is available from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS) via the Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood.

## Notes on Data Use
- Habitat and plant notes are intended to support interpretation of butterfly data rather than to provide quantitative plant metrics.
- Existing long-term data facilitate comparisons and analysis of trends and climate relationships.

## Time Investment
- Each transect requires approximately 0.5–1.5 hours, depending on transect length; total monitoring spans 26 weeks per year.
