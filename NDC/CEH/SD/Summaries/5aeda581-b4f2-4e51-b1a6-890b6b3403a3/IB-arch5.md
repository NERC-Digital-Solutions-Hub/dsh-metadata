# IB Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor the abundance of butterflies using transect methods from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS).
- Build on the national scheme already in operation, providing a 15-year background for comparison with ECN data.
- Enable assessment of changes in butterfly distribution, phenology, and potential relationships with climate.

## Rationale
- Butterflies are easy to identify and respond rapidly to vegetation changes.
- Existing data show meaningful trends and climate relationships, offering a strong baseline for ECN analyses.

## Location
- A fixed transect route is established at each site to be representative of the ECN site and to align with different management regimes.
- Routes are often along existing paths/ boundaries and may be marked to ensure consistency across visits.
- Typical transect length: 1–2 km; can be walked in 30–90 minutes.
- Transect divided into up to 15 sections, each with distinct vegetation/structure/management; section lengths recorded with habitat details and notable food plants.
- Nearby management operations are recorded; changes tracked to aid result interpretation.

## Method

- Recording of transects occurs weekly from 1 April to 29 September, between 10:45 and 15:45 BST (adjustments allowed with weather, e.g., non-rainy days if conditions meet criteria).
- At northern/uphill sites, an upper temperature limit of 15°C is used.
- More than one recorder may be employed to increase coverage during peak butterfly activity.
- Observers should have good knowledge of British butterfly fauna.

- Counting protocol:
  - Transect walked at a steady pace.
  - Butterflies seen flying within or passing through a defined box: 5 m wide, 5 m high, and 5 m in front of the observer (per section) are recorded by species.
  - Start time, temperature, and percentage sunshine recorded; wind speed noted at the end of each transect.
  - Percentage sunshine logged section-by-section as the transect progresses.

## Time
- Each transect typically requires 0.5–1.5 hours.
- Conducted over 26 weeks each year (1 April – 29 September).

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Data are to be submitted to ECNCCU with formats defined in the accompanying Data Transfer documentation (restricted access via Site Managers’ extranet).
- Four core identifiers for every sample/recording occasion:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time
- Core measurement: invertebrates – butterflies (IB Protocol), ECNCCU 2001.

- Weekly recording variables for each transect:
  - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Recording date, Start time, Temperature at end, Percentage sunshine, Wind speed at end, with specified units and precision.

- For each transect section:
  - Transect section number, Species code, Species name, Number seen, Habitat description (numeric code 1–15), BMS code, common name, count, BMS method, and related metadata (with precision where applicable).

- Habitat observations:
  - Short qualitative descriptions of habitat and the most abundant plant species, focusing on butterfly food plants and common nectar sources.

- Recording forms:
  - Standard BMS recording form is used and available from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS), Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood.

- Notes:
  - Coding system should align with BMS standards.
  - Habitat descriptions should be concise and contextual, emphasizing plants relevant to butterfly ecology rather than exhaustive plant inventories.

## Recording forms (access)
- Standard BMS recording forms are available from the BMS organization (ITE Monks Wood, contact details provided in the protocol).

## Notes
- Emphasizes adherence to BMS coding and habitat description conventions to ensure data interoperability and interpretability.
