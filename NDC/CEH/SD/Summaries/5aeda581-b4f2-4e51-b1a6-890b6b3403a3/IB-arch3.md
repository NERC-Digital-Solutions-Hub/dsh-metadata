# IB Protocol

- Aim
  - Monitor butterfly abundance using the transect methods of the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS).
  - Leverage the established national BMS (ITE and JNCC) to provide a strong historical background for comparison with ECN data.
  - Build on long-term data to detect changes in distribution, phenology, and potential climate relationships.

- Rationale
  - Butterflies respond rapidly to changes in vegetation abundance and quality.
  - The ECN protocol mirrors the national scheme to enable comparison with approximately 15 years of prior sampling.
  - Existing analyses have linked butterfly population metrics to climate variables, supporting the value of standardized monitoring.

- Method
  - A fixed transect route is established at each site, chosen to be representative of the ECN site and to cover different management regimes.
  - Routes are typically 1–2 km, walked at a comfortable, even pace, and divided into up to 15 sections used as sampling strata.
  - Within each transect, observers record the number of butterflies seen flying within or passing through a 5 m × 5 m × 5 m box per section, by species.
  - Recording occurs weekly from 1 April to 29 September, during 10:45–15:45 BST (with weather-based exceptions for temperature and sunshine).
  - Recording may be conducted by more than one recorder for peak season coverage.
  - Observers require good knowledge of British butterfly fauna.

- Time
  - Each transect: ~0.5–1.5 hours.
  - Sampling window: 26 weeks annually (1 April–29 September).

- Location and data collection standards
  - The transect route, sectioning, and habitat context are documented, including management operations in the vicinity to aid interpretation.
  - Start time, end-of-recording temperature, percentage sunshine, and wind speed are recorded at the end of each transect.
  - Section-level data include species code, species name, count, habitat description, and a habitat code (1–15) per section.
  - Data are collected using standard BMS recording forms.

- Data specification and metadata
  - Core dataset fields required for every ECN site recording:
    - Site Identification Code (unique ECN Site Code)
    - Core Measurement Code (unique per ECN core measurement)
    - Location Code (replicate sampling locations per core measurement)
    - Sampling Date/Time (with time element if applicable)
  - Core measurement: invertebrates – butterflies (IB Protocol), ECNCCU 2001
  - Weekly variables (1 April–29 September): start time, temperature at end of recording, percentage sunshine, wind speed at end of recording; recording precision specified.
  - For each transect section: transect section number, species code, species name, number seen, habitat description (numeric code 1–15), BMS code, common name, count, BMS method.
  - For each transect section: habitat description with precision (1) as needed.
  - Data transfer and dataset formats are documented in accompanying ECN data transfer documentation; restricted access via Site Managers’ extranet (ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access).

- Recording forms and standards
  - A standard BMS recording form is provided by the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS), managed from the Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood.
  - Coding follows BMS standards.
  - Habitat descriptions are concise, prioritizing general habitat type and key butterfly food plants or nectar sources; not a full quantitative plant survey.

- Notes and interpretation guidance
  - Habitat should be described to aid result interpretation; emphasis on plant species that influence butterfly presence (e.g., nectar sources, larval food plants).
  - The aim is to support interpretation of results rather than to quantify plant abundance precisely.
  - The protocol emphasizes comparability with the national scheme and consistency across ECN sites.
