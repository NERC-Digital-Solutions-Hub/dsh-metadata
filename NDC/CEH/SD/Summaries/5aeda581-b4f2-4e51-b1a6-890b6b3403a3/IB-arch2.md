# IB Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor butterfly abundance using the transect methods of the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme.
- Leverage long-term background data (∼15 years) to compare ECN data and assess changes in distribution, phenology, and climate relationships.

## Rationale
- Butterflies are easy to identify and respond quickly to vegetation changes.
- Historical data show meaningful links between butterfly populations, climate, and habitat management.

## Method
- Use fixed transects at each site, representative of ECN sites; routes often follow existing paths and management regimes.
- Transect length: typically 1–2 km; walk at a comfortable, even pace for 30–90 minutes.
- Divide transect into up to 15 sections with differing habitat/management; record habitat features and key butterfly food plants.
- Record butterflies seen within a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m imaginary box per section; collect start time and site conditions.

## Time
- Recording occurs weekly from 1 April to 29 September.
- Recording window typically 10:45–15:45 BST; weather constraints apply (temperature thresholds: 13–17°C when sun is ≥60%, otherwise recording not in rain; northern uplands upper limit 15°C).
- More than one recorder may be used during peak activity to improve coverage.

## Location and transect setup
- Based on Hall (1981); fixed route to ensure comparability across sampling occasions.
- Route marked if needed; ensures consistent sampling across years.
- Document transect length, section boundaries, habitat types, and presence of butterfly food plants; note nearby management operations.

## Recording procedure
- For each transect section, record: transect section number, species code/name, number seen, habitat description (or numeric code), BMS code, and method.
- For the transect as a whole: record start time, end temperature, percent sunshine, wind speed (Beaufort scale) with precision.
- Section-by-section sunshine should be recorded as the transect progresses.
- If multiple recorders are used, duplicate data entry helps during peak periods.

## Data parameters and formats
- Core data identifiers for each sampling occasion: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Recording Date/Time.
- For each transect: start time, temperature, sunshine, wind speed, and recording details.
- For each transect section: species code, species name, count, habitat description (with standard codes).
- Data transfer formats are defined in ECNCCU documentation (restricted extranet); contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Variables must be recorded weekly (April 1 – September 29) with consistent coding and timing.
- Habitat descriptions should be concise and focus on plants that are important for butterflies (food plants and nectar sources); the aim is interpretive context rather than precise plant quantification.

## Recording forms
- Standard Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS) recording forms are used and available from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood.

## Notes
- Coding should follow BMS standards.
- Habitat descriptions should be concise and contextual to assist interpretation without exhaustive plant quantification.
