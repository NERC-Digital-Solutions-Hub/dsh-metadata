# IB Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor butterfly abundance using transect methods from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS).
- Leverage ECN protocol aligned with the national BMS; ~15 years of existing data for comparisons.
- Build on prior findings linking butterfly populations to climate and habitat changes.

## Rationale
- Butterflies are easy to identify and respond quickly to vegetation changes.
- Uses an established, long-running scheme (ITE and JNCC) to provide a strong background dataset.
- Prior analyses show relationships between population size, phenology, and climate.

## Method
- Fixed transect route at each site, following Hall (1981); representative of the ECN site; marked if needed to ensure consistency.
- Transect length typically 1–2 km, walked at a comfortable pace in 30–90 minutes.
- Divided into up to 15 sections with different vegetation/management to serve as sampling strata.
- Weekly recording from 1 April to 29 September, 10:45–15:45 BST (with temperature thresholds guiding conditions; northern upland sites max 15°C).
- Transect counted by observing butterflies within a 5 m (width) × 5 m (height) × 5 m ( front) box in front of the observer, recorded by species for each section.
- Start time, temperature, percentage sunshine, and wind speed recorded at the end of each transect.
- More than one recorder can be used to cover peaks or absence; observers should have good knowledge of British butterfly fauna.
- Recording forms and standard BMS conventions are to be used.

## Location
- A fixed transect route at each ECN site, designed to be representative and consistent across sampling.
- Routes follow existing paths or boundaries and include areas under different management regimes.
- If needed, routes should be marked to ensure consistency across all sampling occasions.

## Recording conventions and timing
- Core variables must be recorded weekly:
  - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Recording date/time, Start time, End temperature, Percentage sunshine, Wind speed.
- For transect sections:
  - Transect section number, Species code, Species name, Number seen, Habitat description (numeric code 1–15), BMS code, Common name, Count, BMS method.
  - Habitat description precision: 1 (for standardized coding).
- Core dataset framing: core measurement is “invertebrates - butterflies” (ECNCCU 2001).

## Time and effort
- 0.5–1.5 hours per transect per week (across 26 weeks per year).

## Data standards and accessibility
- Data submitted to ECNCCU; refer to Data Transfer documentation for dataset formats (restricted access Site Managers' extranet).
- First four key parameters uniquely identify a sample: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
- ECN Site codes and replication locations are managed locally; data may be uploaded to portals with comprehensive metadata.

## Recording forms
- Standard BMS recording form available from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS), with contact: Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, Biological Records Centre, ITE Monks Wood, Abbots Ripton, Huntingdon, Cambs.

## Notes
- Coding should follow standard BMS conventions.
- Habitat descriptions should be brief and informed by BMS handbook; note useful plant species (but not quantified abundances) to aid interpretation, focusing on butterfly food plants and nectar sources.
