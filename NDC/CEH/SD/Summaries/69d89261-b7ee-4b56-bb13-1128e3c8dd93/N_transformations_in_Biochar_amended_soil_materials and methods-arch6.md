# Chemical analysis of nitrogen transformations in Biochar amended soil - materials and methods

## Aim
- Describe field and laboratory procedures used to assess how biochar influences nitrogen transformations and N2O emissions, including isotopic tracing (15N) to quantify N transformations.

## Field site and biochar
- Field near Lincoln, Lincolnshire with a three-year wheat–oilseed rape rotation; 140 kg N ha-1 yr-1 applied as NH4+ and NO3-.
- Soil: sandy loam (57% sand, 32% silt, 10% clay; bulk density 1.39 g cm-3).
- Biochar: hardwood-derived, slow-pyrolysis (180°C then 400°C for 24 h); C 72.3%, N 0.71%, pH 9.25, moisture 3.1%; low extractable inorganic N.

## Experimental design
- Two main experiments:
  1) Effects of biochar on N2O emissions from soils with different aeration status (four-treatment factorial: with/without biochar; wetted vs un-wetted; 5 replicates; 1.6 kg soil cores; biochar at ~3% soil dry weight).
  2) Biochar effects on soil N transformations using 15N pool dilution (four-treatment factorial; biochar at 2% soil dry weight; optimum conditions for N2O emissions achieved by adjusting water-filled pore space to 90%).

## Treatments and sample preparation
- Experiment 1: vegetable soil cores (7 cm depth) incubated at 16°C in dark; water regimes created by GMC adjustments (un-wetted at 23% GMC; wetted increased to 28% GMC during four wetting events).
- Experiment 2: soils incubated at 16°C in the dark; excess 15NH4+NO3 or NH4+15NO3 applied to achieve 90% WFPS; samples incubated and destructively sampled at multiple time points.

## Measurements and data collected
- Soil properties: extractable NH4+ and NO3- (KCl extraction), total C and N, gravimetric moisture content, pH, particle density, and WFPS.
- Gas measurements: N2O concentrations in headspace over time; fluxes calculated from the initial 0–60 min increase; linearity checked (r^2 ≥ 0.8).
- Isotopic analyses: 15NH4+/15NO3- distribution; organic 15N as microbial biomass proxy; 15N2O and N2 in headspace analyzed by IRMS; inorganic and organic 15N concentrations measured via standardized disk digestion methods.

## Analytical methods
- Inorganic N (NH4+, NO3-): 5 g soil with 0.8 M KCl; colorimetric analysis (Seal AQ2).
- Total C and N: CN analyzer (LECO).
- pH, moisture, density, and WFPS: standard soil methods.
- Headspace N2O: GC with calibration against certified standards; fluxes from slope of ppm increase.
- Isotopes:
  - Inorganic 15N: acidified disk method; combustion with CN analyzer and IRMS.
  - Organic 15N: analyzed as microbial biomass proxy.
  - 15N2O and 15N2: headspace injections into IRMS after gas preparation and purification steps.

## Data quality and processing
- N2O fluxes based on linear increase (0–60 min); exclude vials with non-linear increases (r^2 < 0.8).
- Multiple replicates per treatment; standardized calibration against certified standards for isotopes and gas measurements.

## Data outputs and potential products
- Quantified N2O emissions under different biochar and moisture conditions.
- Tracked N transformations via 15N pool dilution, including inorganic and organic N pools.
- Datasets suitable for modelling N fluxes, comparing biochar effects, and informing data products that enable self-serve analysis of N dynamics in amended soils.
