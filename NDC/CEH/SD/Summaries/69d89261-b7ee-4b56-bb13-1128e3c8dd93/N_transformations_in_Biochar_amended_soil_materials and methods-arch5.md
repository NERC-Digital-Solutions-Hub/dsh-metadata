# Chemical analysis of nitrogen transformations in Biochar amended soil - materials and methods

## Study site and biochar materials
- Field site near Lincoln, Lincolnshire; arable rotation (three years wheat followed by one year oilseed rape).
- Nitrogen application: total of 140 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as NH4+ and NO3-, split into three applications.
- Soil: sandy loam (57% sand, 32% silt, 10% clay); bulk density 1.39 g cm-3.
- Biochar: slow-pyrolysis batch process; hardwood thinnings (ash, oak, cherry) as feedstock; produced at 180°C then 400°C for 24 h.
- Biochar properties: total C 72.3%, total N 0.71%, low extractable inorganic N, pH 9.25, gravimetric moisture content 3.1%.

## Experimental design: N2O emissions from soil with differing aeration
- Setup: twenty soil cores (150–180 mm depth, ~1.6 kg dry weight) arranged in a four-treatment factorial.
- Treatments: (a) with vs without biochar; (b) un-wetted vs wetted to create different GMC regimes.
- Replicates: 5 per treatment.
- Biochar amendment: <2 mm fraction mixed at ~3% soil dry weight (~22 t ha-1) into half the cores.
- Incubation: after a seven-day equilibration to minimize CO2 flush, cores kept at 16°C in the dark.
- Water status: un-wetted cores at 23% GMC; wetted cores increased to 28% GMC at wetting events on days 17, 46, 67, and 116.
- Headspace sampling: days 4, 17, 31, 46, 67, 116, 120 for un-wetted; additional 12, 24, 48 hours after wetting for wetted cores.
- Gas sampling: 10 mL from headspace (0.9 L total) at 0, 20, 40, 60 minutes; analyzed for N2O by GC.
- Post-incubation analyses (day 120): soil pH, extractable NH4+/NO3-, total C and N; cores stored at 4°C and sampled to 7 cm depth.

## Experimental design: 15N pool dilution and biochar effects on N transformations
- Setup: four-treatment factorial to investigate biochar effects on N transformations under optimal conditions for N2O emissions.
- Biochar addition: 2% soil dry weight (<2 mm).
- Incubation: 100 g dry soil per container (80× H×D cm container) at 16°C in the dark for seven days to allow CO2 flush.
- N labeling: solutions of 15NH4+NO3 or NH4+15NO3 applied to achieve 90% water-filled pore space (WFPS) and 110 kg N ha-1 after enrichment (10 at% 15N).
- Time points and sampling: five destructive sampling points (30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6 days) with four replicates per treatment for total C and N, soil pH, GMC, BD, extractable NH4+/NO3-, 15NH4+/15NO3, organic-N and organic15N.
- Headspace sampling: at seven time points after 15N addition (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 days) for N2O analysis (gas-tight enclosure; 60 min sampling with 10 mL extracts).

## Analyses of soil properties
- Inorganic N (NH4+/NO3-): determined from 5 g soil with 50 mL 0.8 M KCl; discrete colorimetric procedures using a Seal AQ2 analyser.
- Total C and N: dry combustion (CN analyzer, LECO).
- Physical/moisture parameters: gravimetric moisture content, particle density, and water-filled pore space (WFPS) following standard methods.

## Headspace nitrogen analyses
- N2O: gas concentrations measured by GC; calibrated with certified standards; flux calculated from linear increase in ppm over 0–60 minutes after enclosure.
- Data quality: last sample excluded if gas concentration increase did not fit linear trend (R^2 < 0.8).

## Isotopic analyses
- Inorganic 15N (15NH4+ and 15NO3-): acidified filter disk method; analyzed by CN analyzer coupled to Isotope Ratio Mass-Spectrometer (IRMS).
- Organic 15N: analyzed as a proxy for microbial biomass.
- 15N2O: 80 mL headspace injected into 60 mL serum bottles; δ15N derived via trace gas precursor to IRMS.
- 15N2: headspace samples injected into N2 prep unit; CO2 removed; N2 analyzed by IRMS after purification.

## References and standard methods
- Methods and models referenced for N flux calculations, CO2 and N2O exchanges, soil analyses, and 15N tracing, including specific standard and methodological papers (e.g., 15N diffusion methods, isotope analysis protocols, and standard soil analysis protocols).

## Data and metadata considerations for data stewards
- Data types produced:
  - Time-series for N2O concentrations and fluxes (per treatment, replicate, and time point).
  - Isotopic compositions for inorganic and organic N pools (15N data for NH4+, NO3-, NH4+NO3-, and organic N; 15N2O and 15N2).
  - Soil properties across time (pH, GMC, BD, extractable NH4+/NO3-, total C and N).
- Key metadata to capture:
  - Site details, field management history, soil properties (texture, BD, initial GMC), and biochar characteristics.
  - Experimental design factors: presence/absence of biochar, aeration status (wetted/un-wetted), WFPS targets, sampling days, depths, replication.
  - Analytical methods and instrumentation settings (GC calibration, IRMS setup, CN analyzer, KCl extraction procedure) and QA thresholds (R^2 cutoff for linear flux calculation).
- Data governance implications:
  - Ensure standardization and interoperability by aligning with referenced standard methods.
  - Document provenance, including preparation steps (biochar addition, soil sieving, incubation conditions) and processing workflows.
  - Consider data sharing formats and repositories suitable for large, multi-parameter datasets (time series, isotopic data, and soil chemistry) to facilitate reuse by data users and other researchers.
