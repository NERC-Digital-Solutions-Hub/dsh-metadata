# Chemical analysis of nitrogen transformations in Biochar amended soil - materials and methods.

- Field site and biochar description
  - Field near Lincoln, Lincolnshire; arable rotation: 3 years wheat followed by 1 year oilseed rape; total N input 140 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as NH4+/NO3.
  - Soil: sandy loam (57% sand, 32% silt, 10% clay); bulk density 1.39 g cm-3.
  - Biochar: slow-pyrolysis from hardwood thinnings (ash, oak, cherry); produced by heating to 180°C then 400°C for 24 h.
  - Biochar properties: C 72.3%, N 0.71%, low extractable inorganic N (<1.0–1.3 mg N kg-1 NH4+/NO3), pH 9.25, gravimetric moisture content 3.1%.

- Effects of biochar on N2O emissions from soil of differing aeration status (experimental design)
  - Four-treatment factorial: un-amended vs biochar-amended; un-wetted vs wetted with deionised water (five replicates per treatment; n=20 cores).
  - Biochar addition: 3% soil dry weight (<2 mm biochar; ~22 t ha-1).
  - Incubation: cores mixed to 7 cm depth; after equilibration, stored at 16°C in the dark.
  - Moisture regimes: un-wetted at ~23% GMC; wetted to ~28% GMC by four wetting events on days 17, 46, 67, 116 (based on field GMC data 2009–2010).
  - Sampling: headspace gas collected on days 4, 17, 31, 46, 67, 116, 120 for un-wetted cores; additional samples for wetted cores at 12, 24, 48 h after wetting.
  - Gas analysis: N2O concentration by GC; fluxes calculated from linear increase (0–60 min) in enclosed headspace; linearity checked (r^2 ≥ 0.8).

- Biochar effects on soil N transformations (15N pool dilution experiment)
  - Four-treatment factorial with 15N pool dilution; aim to investigate biochar effects on N transformations under optimum N2O emission conditions (90% WFPS).
  - Soil preparation: soil from field, sieved to <4 mm; biochar (<2 mm) added at 2% soil dry weight.
  - Incubation setup: 100 g dry soil per container (n=4 replicates per treatment), 1 cm depth, stored at 16°C in dark for 7 days to allow CO2 flush.
  - 15N labeling: solutions of 100.0 ± 0.1 mg N kg-1 in water with 15NH4+NO3 and NH4+15NO3 to achieve 90% WFPS and 110 kg N ha-1 enrichment.
  - Sampling: destructive sampling at five time points for soil properties and isotopes; headspace gas sampling at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 days with 10 mL gas samples for N2O analysis.
  - Measurements: total C and N, pH, GMC, BD, extractable NH4+/NO3-, 15NH4+/15NO3-, organic-15N; N2O isotopic composition analyses.

- Analysis of soil properties
  - Inorganic N extraction: 5 g soil with 50 mL 0.8 M KCl (6%) for NH4+ and NO3-; measured on a Seal AQ2 analyzer using discrete colorimetric procedures.
  - Total C and N: dried ground soil analyzed with CN analyzer (LECO).
  - Moisture and physical properties: gravimetric moisture content; particle density; water-filled pore space (WFPS) by standard methods.
  - References to standard methods cited for method legitimacy.

- Headspace N2O analysis
  - Gas samples analyzed for N2O by gas chromatography (GC) with calibration against certified standards.
  - Flux calculation: based on linear increase in ppm from 0 to 60 min; QC by linearity (r^2 criterion).

- Analysis of N isotopic composition
  - Extractable inorganic-15N (15NH4+ and 15NO3-) analyzed via acidified disk method; organic-15N analyzed as a microbial biomass proxy.
  - Inorganic 15N and organics: combusted in CN analyzer/IRMS setup for isotope ratios.
  - 15N2O analysis: headspace 80 mL injected into 60 mL serum bottles; δ15N determined via trace gas precursor method connected to IRMS.
  - 15N2 analysis: headspace 20 mL injected into N2 preparation line (CO2 removed, N2 purified) and analyzed by IRMS.

- Data quality and references
  - Use of replicates and standardized analytical protocols; calibration against certified standards; multiple methodological references cited for isotopic and gas analyses.

- Key data considerations for data management (relevant to Data Leaders)
  - Detailed experimental design with clear treatments, replication, and time points to enable reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
  - Comprehensive suite of measured variables: N species pools (NH4+, NO3-, organic-N, 15N-labeled pools), N2O flux and isotopic composition, total C and N, pH, GMC, BD, and WFPS.
  - Explicit quality control criteria (e.g., r^2 ≥ 0.8 for gas flux linearity) and standardized sampling protocols.
  - Metadata-rich context: site description, soil type, biochar properties, application rates, moisture regimes, and storage conditions for samples.
