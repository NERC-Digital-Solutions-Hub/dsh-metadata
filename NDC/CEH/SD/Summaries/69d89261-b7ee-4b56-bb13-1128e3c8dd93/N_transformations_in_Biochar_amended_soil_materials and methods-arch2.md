# Chemical analysis of nitrogen transformations in Biochar amended soil - materials and methods

- Field site: Near Lincoln, Lincolnshire; arable rotation (three years wheat, one year oilseed rape); total N aplicación 140 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as NH4+ and NO3-; sandy loam soil (57% sand, 32% silt, 10% clay; bulk density 1.39 g cm-3).
- Biochar characteristics: Slow-pyrolysis hardwood biochar (ash, oak, cherry; Bodfari Charcoal, UK); produced by heating to 180°C then 400°C for 24 h; total C 72.3%, total N 0.71%, low extractable inorganic-N (<1.0–1.3 mg N kg-1 NH4+/NO3-), pH 9.25, gravimetric moisture content 3.1%.

- Study 1: Effects of biochar on N2O emissions from soils with different aeration
  - Design: Four-treatment factorial; treatments as unamended or biochar-amended; un-wetted (23% GMC) or wetted (28% GMC) with deionised water; 5 replicates per treatment.
  - Biochar application: 3% soil dry weight (<2 mm biochar) mixed into soil.
  - Procedure: After a seven-day equilibration to account for potential CO2 flush, 22 cores incubated at 16°C in the dark; headspace gas sampling at multiple times (days 4, 17, 31, 46, 67, 116, 120; additional 12, 24, 48 h after wetting for wetted treatments).
  - Measurements: N2O concentrations by gas chromatography; headspace closure to form airtight seal; flux calculated from 0–60 min increase in ppm with linear fit (r2 threshold >0.8).
  - End-point analyses (day 120): Soil pH, extractable NH4+ and NO3-, total C and N; cores fractioned to 7 cm for homogenization and analysis.

- Study 2: Biochar effects on soil N transformations using 15N pool dilution
  - Design: Four-treatment factorial; biochar amendment at 2% soil dry weight; 90% water-filled pore space (WFPS) to optimize N2O production; 100 g dry soil per container (80 containers total).
  - Isotopic labeling: 15N-enriched NH4NO3 and NH4NO3-15N solutions added to achieve 110 kg N ha-1 with 10 atom% 15N enrichment.
  - Procedure: 7-day pre-incubation at 16°C in the dark; samples incubated in sealed containers; destructive sampling at 4, 6 days and multiple earlier time points for 15N distribution; gas sampling at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 6 days for N2O analysis.
  - Measurements: Total C and N, soil pH, GMC, bulk density (BD), extractable NH4+, NO3-, 15N-labeled inorganic pools, organic-N and organic15N concentrations.

- Analytical methods
  - Inorganic N analysis: Extractable NH4+ and NO3- by extracting 5 g soil with 50 mL 0.8 M KCl; colorimetric analysis using a Seal AQ2 analyzer (detailing standard procedures).
  - Total C and N: Dry combustion using a CN analyzer (LECO).
  - Physical properties: Gravimetric moisture content, soil pH (soil:H2O, 1:2.5 w/v), particle density, and water-filled pore space (WFPS) per standard methods.
  - N2O and CO2 analyses: Headspace N2O concentrations measured by gas chromatography (GC) with calibration against certified standards; fluxes calculated from concentration increases; linearity checked (r2 ≥ 0.8).
  - Isotopic analysis
    - Inorganic 15N: Analyzed via acidified disk method; isotopic composition determined by combustion with an elemental analyser coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS).
    - Organic 15N: Analyzed as a proxy for microbial biomass via combustion and IRMS.
    - 15N2O: 80 mL headspace samples injected into evacuated vials; δ15N values derived using a gas precursor coupled to IRMS.
    - 15N2: Headspace sampling followed by gas preparation (perchlorate trap to remove water, cryogenic CO2 removal, copper reduction) and IRMS measurement.
  - Quality and calibration: Analyses calibrated against certified standards; isotopic analyses followed established methods (references provided).
