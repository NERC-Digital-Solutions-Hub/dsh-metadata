# Chemical analysis of nitrogen transformations in Biochar amended soil - materials and methods.

- Field site and biochar description
  - Field site near Lincoln, Lincolnshire with a three-year wheat and one-year oilseed rape rotation.
  - Total N fertiliser: 140 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as NH4+ NO3−.
  - Soil: sandy loam (57% sand, 32% silt, 10% clay), bulk density 1.39 g cm-3.
  - Biochar: slow-pyrolysis, staged heating to 180 °C then 400 °C for 24 h; hardwood feedstock (ash, oak, cherry).
  - Biochar properties: C 72.3%, N 0.71%, low extractable inorganic-N, pH 9.25, gravimetric moisture content 3.1%.

- Effects of biochar on N2O emissions from soil of differing aeration status
  - Design: four-treatment factorial with 20 soil cores; treatments = with/without biochar × un-wetted vs wetted (n=5 per treatment).
  - Biochar amendment: 3% soil dry weight (<2 mm, ~22 t ha-1).
  - Incubation: after a 7-day equilibration, cores kept at 16 °C in the dark; un-wetted cores at 23% GMC; wetted cores raised to 28% GMC at 0, 17, 46, 67, 116, and 120 days (four wetting events).
  - N2O sampling: headspace gas samples taken at multiple time points (days 4, 17, 31, 46, 67, 116, 120; additional 12, 24, 48 h after wetting for wetted cores).
  - Analysis: 10 ml sample from headspace injected into evacuated vials; N2O concentrations measured by GC.
  - Flux calculation: from linear increase (ppm) between 0 and 60 minutes after enclosure; linearity requirement r^2 ≥ 0.8.

- Biochar effects on soil N transformations (15N pool dilution approach)
  - Design: four-treatment factorial with two 15N labeling schemes (15NH4+NO3 or NH4+15NO3) and 90% WFPS; 100 g dry soil per container (n=4 per treatment per time point).
  - Biochar amendment: 2% soil dry weight (<2 mm).
  - Incubation: soils stored at 16 °C in the dark for 7 days to allow CO2 flush.
  - 15N labeling: added to achieve 10 atom% 15N enrichment (~110 kg N ha-1); incubation in sealed containers.
  - Sampling: destructively at 5 time points for total C and N, soil pH, GMC, BD, extractable NH4+, 15NH4+, NO3−, 15NO3−, organic-N and organic15N.
  - Isotopic analysis: headspace samples for N2O and 15N analyses; multiple time points (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 days) with four replicates per treatment.
  - Additional 15N analyses: δ15N for inorganic-N via acidified disk method; organic15N as microbial biomass proxy.
  - Instrumentation: CHN/CN analyzer for C and N; Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) for 15N and 15N2O/15N2; GC-based N2O measurements.

- Analysis of soil properties
  - Inorganic N extraction: 5 g soil with 50 ml 0.8 M KCl; NH4+ and NO3− quantified by colorimetric methods (SEAL AQ2 or equivalent).
  - Total C and N: dried ground soil analyzed by CN analyzer (LECO or equivalent).
  - Physical properties: gravimetric moisture content, soil pH (in H2O, 1:2.5 w:v), particle density, and water-filled pore space (WFPS) using standard methods.

- Headspace N2O and isotopic analyses
  - N2O quantification: GC with calibration against certified standards; flux derived from linear increase in ppm over 0–60 minutes.
  - Quality control: samples retained if linearity criterion met (r^2 ≥ 0.8).
  - Isotopic analyses:
    - Inorganic-N isotopes: acidified disk method; combustion and IRMS (Isoprime) for δ15N.
    - Organic-N: analyzed as microbial biomass proxy.
    - 15N2O: 80 ml headspace injected into a 60 ml bottle; δ15N derived via Isoprime IRMS after appropriate headspace handling.
    - 15N2: 20 ml headspace injected into vials; CO2 removed, N2 purified and analyzed by IRMS.

- Notes on data integrity and methodology
  - Calibrations performed with certified standards; gas analyses standardized against established procedures.
  - Use of multiple replicates and time points to capture dynamic N transformations and N2O emissions.
  - Explicit documentation of data handling steps (e.g., linear flux calculation, retention criteria for samples).

- Key outputs and relevance for monitoring
  - Quantified N2O emissions and their dependence on biochar presence and soil aeration/wetting status.
  - Quantitative insights into how biochar alters N transformations in arable soils via 15N tracing.
  - Comprehensive datasets on soil inorganic and organic N pools, C and N content, moisture, pH, and physical properties under biochar amendments.
  - Isotopic data enabling partitioning of N fluxes into microbial and mineralization pathways, informing monitoring frameworks on nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas emissions.
