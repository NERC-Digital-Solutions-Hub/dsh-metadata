# Chemical analysis of nitrogen transformations in Biochar amended soil - materials and methods.

- Objective
  - Investigate how biochar amendment affects nitrogen transformations and N2O emissions in arable soil.
  - Use two factorial experiments to trace N dynamics and quantify N transformations with isotopic labeling.

- Biochar and field site description
  - Location: field site near Lincoln, Lincolnshire.
  - Cropping history: arable rotation of three years wheat followed by one year oilseed rape.
  - Fertilization: total 140 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as NH4+ and NO3-, split into three applications.
  - Soil type: sandy loam (57% sand, 32% silt, 10% clay); bulk density 1.39 g cm-3.
  - Biochar characteristics: slow-pyrolysis hardwood biochar (ash, oak, cherry; Bodfari Charcoal, UK).
    - Feedstock: hardwood thinnings.
    - Composition: C 72.3%, N 0.71%, low extractable inorganic N (<1.0–1.3 mg N kg-1 for NH4+ and NO3-).
    - Properties: pH 9.25, gravimetric moisture content 3.1%.

- Experiment 1: Effects of biochar on N2O emissions from soil of differing aeration status
  - Design: four-treatment factorial; soils unamended or amended with biochar and un-wetted or wetted with deionised water; 5 replicates per treatment.
  - Biochar rate: 3% soil dry weight (approximately 22 t ha-1).
  - Procedure:
    - After a seven-day equilibration to allow CO2 flush to subside, cores were placed at 16 °C in the dark.
    - Water regimes: un-wetted cores at 23% GMC; wetted cores raised to 28% GMC at the start of four wetting events on days 17, 46, 67, and 116 (based on field GMC data).
    - Sampling schedule: headspace gas samples from un-wetted cores on days 4, 17, 31, 46, 67, 116, and 120; additional samples from wetted cores at 12, 24, and 48 hours after each wetting event.
    - Core preparation: 1.6 kg soil (dried weight) per core; cores enclosed in PVC, headspace sampled to measure N2O.
  - Measurements:
    - N2O concentrations analyzed by gas chromatography.
    - Fluxes calculated from the linear increase in headspace N2O concentration (0–60 minutes).
    - Post-incubation soil analyses: pH, extractable NH4+ and NO3-, total C and N.

- Experiment 2: Biochar effects on soil N transformations using 15N pool dilution
  - Design: four-treatment factorial; soils amended or un-amended with biochar and enriched with 15N-labeled N; adjusted to 90% water-filled pore space (WFPS).
  - Biochar rate: 2% soil dry weight.
  - Preparation: field soil collected January 2012, sieved to <4 mm, stored at 4 °C; after initial setup, 100 g dry soil aliquots placed into 80 containers (approximately 1.7 L each) at 1 cm depth; dark storage at 16 °C for seven days to allow CO2 flush.
  - Isotopic labeling: Solutions of 100.0 ± 0.1 mg N kg-1 in 15N-labeled NH4+NO3 or NH4+15NO3 (90% 15N enrichment) applied to achieve ~110 kg N ha-1 with 15N enrichment.
  - Incubation: containers sealed; samples destructively collected at multiple time points after labeling (C, N, pH, GMC, BD, extractable NH4+, 15NH4+, NO3-, 15NO3-, organic-N, organic-15N).
  - N2O measurements: headspace gas samples taken at seven time points after 15N addition; samples analyzed for N2O concentration and 15N composition.
  - Time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 6 days after 15N addition (eight points listed; methodological note indicates multiple sampling for gas analyses).

- Analytical methods (soil properties)
  - Extractable inorganic N (NH4+, NO3-): 5 g soil with 50 mL 0.8 M KCl; analyzed via discrete colorimetric procedures on a Seal AQ2.
  - Total C and N: dried, ground soil analyzed with a CN analyzer (LECO).
  - Gravimetric moisture content, pH (soil: H2O, 1:2.5 w/v), particle density, and WFPS: standard methods.

- Headspace N2O analysis
  - Gas chromatography with calibration against certified standards.
  - N2O flux calculation from ppm increase in headspace from 0 to 60 minutes.
  - Quality control: the final sample from a core used only if the gas concentration increased linearly (R2 ≥ 0.8).

- Analysis of N isotopic composition
  - Inorganic 15N (15NH4+, 15NO3-): acidified disk method; disks combusted in CN analyzer coupled to isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS).
  - Organic 15N: analyzed as a proxy for microbial biomass.
  - 15N2O: headspace samples (80 mL) injected into evacuated bottles; δ15N values derived via trace gas precursor and IRMS.
  - 15N2: headspace samples prepared for N2 analysis; CO2 removed cryogenically; N2 purified and introduced to IRMS.
