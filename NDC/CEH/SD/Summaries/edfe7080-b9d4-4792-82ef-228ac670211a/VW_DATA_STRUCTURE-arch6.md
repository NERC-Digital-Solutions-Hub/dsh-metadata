# UK Environmental Change Network (http://www.ecn.ac.uk) Vegetation: Woodland (VW)

- Overview: Data on woodland vegetation collected by ECN to understand causes and consequences of environmental change; protocols and metadata designed to enable reuse and cross-site comparisons.
- Origin, ownership, and attribution: 
  - Originator: ECN Data Centre, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology
  - Owners: UK government-sponsored ECN programme with a consortium of partner organizations
  - Acknowledgement: Please acknowledge ECN data and reference the protocol; consider sharing a reprint of publications citing ECN data
- Protocol and sampling design:
  - Nested plot design: coarse-grain vegetation survey with a nested 10m x 10m plot surrounding a 2m x 2m central plot; includes measurements of seedlings, diameter at breast height (dbh), tree height, and dominance
  - Sampling frequency: repeated approximately every nine years; dbh measured every three years
  - Site context: woodland sites with associated coarse-grain vegetation protocol; quality information accompanies data
  - Access: ECN Data Centre or Environmental Information Platform
- Site codes, geography, and date range:
  - T08: Wytham (1993–2012)
  - T09: Alice Holt (1994–2011)
- Data structure and storage:
  - Core storage: Oracle database with two site-specific tables per site
    - D1VW_xxx (vegetation data)
    - D2VW_xxx (plots and related data)
  - Core fields: SITECODE, SYEAR, PLOTPID, CELLID, TREEID, STEMID, TREE_SPEC, FIELDNAME, VALUE
  - Metadata references: M_DESC, M_REFFIELD, and core metadata documentation
- Variables and field definitions (highlights):
  - Core fields across tables: SITECODE, SYEAR, PLOTPID, CELLID, TREEID, STEMID, TREE_SPEC, FIELDNAME, VALUE
  - Field themes (FIELDNAME): A, C, DIAMETER, HEIGHT, SEEDLING, NUM_STEMS, Q1–Q8 (data quality codes)
  - Value handling: linked to predefined field names with associated quality codes
- Field names and species codes:
  - Standardized field names; extensive species code mappings link numeric codes to Latin names and external taxonomic concepts
  - Coverage includes trees, shrubs, herbs, lichens, mosses, and more; cross-database concept references (e.g., Latin names, taxonomy resources)
- Data quality, metadata, and usage notes:
  - Use accompanying quality information (Q1–Q8) when interpreting VALUE
  - Protocols, site details, and species mappings documented to support reproducibility and integration
- Access, attribution, and citation guidelines:
  - Data accessible via the ECN Data Centre; acknowledge ECN data in publications
  - Cite the ECN protocol and data origin; consider sending a reprint to ECN
  - Additional data platforms: Environmental Information Platform may host ECN data alongside other datasets
- Practical takeaways for data support and data products:
  - Structure: Two site-specific tables per site (D1VW_xxx and D2VW_xxx) in Oracle; design dashboards around SITECODE, SYEAR, PLOTPID, TREE_SPEC, and FIELDNAME–VALUE
  - Data integration: Join across site tables using SITECODE, SYEAR, and PLOTPID; rich species codes enable cross-referencing with external taxonomies
  - Quality management: Always consult quality codes and accompanying metadata for valid analyses and visuals
  - Data usage: Acknowledge ECN data; share outputs back to ECN to demonstrate dataset value
- Data details: Quality codes (ECN standard)
  - ECN site managers assign quality codes from a standardized list; 999 indicates an unusual event (see accompanying quality text)
  - Examples of codes cover data loss, sampling issues, equipment problems, environmental disturbances, and other factors affecting data quality
- Species codes (illustrative)
  - Extensive mappings between numeric species codes and Latin names; examples include various Salix, Sorbus, Salix cinerea oleifolia, Sambucus nigra, Vaccinium species, and many others
  - Mappings also include synonyms and cross-references to Vas_ and other internal taxonomic identifiers
  - Indicates a comprehensive taxonomy crosswalk to support data integration and external comparisons
