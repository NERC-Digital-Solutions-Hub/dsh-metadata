# UK Environmental Change Network (http://www.ecn.ac.uk) Vegetation: Woodland (VW)

- Purpose and audience
  - Long-term vegetation data for woodland plots intended for GIS-based map visualisations and spatial analyses of environmental change.
- Data origin, ownership, and use requirements
  - Originator: ECN Data Centre, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
  - Owners: UK ECN programme; acknowledge in use and provide one reprint of any publication citing the data.
- Protocol and data collection
  - Coarse-grain plots: 2m x 2m with a centered 10m x 10m subplot for trees/shrubs, including seedlings and DBH.
  - Measurements: trees, shrubs, seedlings, DBH, height, dominance; repeated every nine years; DBH every three years.
  - Data integration: linked to ECN core protocols and other ECN datasets; quality metadata provided for robust GIS use.
- Data structure and schema
  - Storage: two Oracle tables per site (D1VW_xxx for core/site-level data; D2VW_xxx for plot-level data).
  - Core fields (site-level example): SITECODE, SYEAR, PLOTPID, CELLID, TREEID, STEMID, TREE_SPEC, FIELDNAME, VALUE.
  - Plot-level fields: PLOTPID, DOMDATE, DBHDATE, SEEDDATE; encoding via predefined codes and lookup tables.
  - Metadata: core metadata tables exist; full schema details in ECN metadata documentation.
- Site codes and locations
  - T08: Wytham – 51°46'52.86"N, 1°20'9.81"W; data range 1993–2012.
  - T09: Alice Holt – 51°9'16.46"N, 0°51'47.58"W; data range 1994–2011.
- Field names and data encoding
  - Vegetation attributes captured with codes (e.g., A, E, I, S, U, H, HEIGHT, DIAMETER, NUM_STEMS, SEEDLING) plus quality indicators (Q1–Q8) and quality code 999 for unusual events.
  - Species and field codes are linked to lookup tables (including extensive mappings for taxonomic synonyms) to support consistent GIS symbolisation and queries.
- Data access, usage notes, and attribution
  - Protocol and metadata documented; use quality metadata when applying data.
  - Acknowledgement requested; supply ECN with one reprint of publications citing the data.
  - Designed for GIS analyses and map-based products enabling spatial exploration of woodland vegetation across sites and years.
- GIS readiness and usage considerations
  - Data are map-ready at plot and tree levels; can be joined to generate fine-scale vegetation maps and temporal change analyses.
  - Two-site Oracle schema (D1VW_xxx and D2VW_xxx) supports scalable GIS workflows; coordinate and site metadata enable cross-site comparisons and integration with other layers.
  - Quality metadata and site-level metadata should be consulted to ensure reliable representation and interpretation.
- Limitations and considerations for GIS practitioners
  - Data dispersed across multiple sites and tables; variation in resolutions and standards; substantial cleaning/transformation may be required for harmonised GIS outputs.
  - Emphasis on rigorous field protocols and quality metadata; integrate quality codes and site metadata in map products.

- Species codes: mapping and synonym resolution
  - The provided text contains extensive mappings between species codes and authoritative taxonomic names (e.g., Salix cinerea ssp oleifolia, Salix repens, Sambucus nigra, etc.), including multiple synonyms and cross-references to ensure consistent GIS interpretation across datasets.
- Quality Codes: guidance for data quality
  - A comprehensive list of ECN quality codes (100–999) with detailed descriptions (e.g., data lost, sample issues, weather or field conditions impacts, laboratory/measurement notes).
  - Code 999 indicates an unusual event requiring accompanying quality text.
