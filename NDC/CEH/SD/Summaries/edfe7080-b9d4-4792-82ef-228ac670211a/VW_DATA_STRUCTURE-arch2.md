# UK Environmental Change Network (http://www.ecn.ac.uk) Vegetation: Woodland (VW)

- The VW dataset includes a comprehensive species codes crosswalk that maps numeric codes to taxonomic names, with accompanying common names and database identifiers (e.g., BRC concepts) and synonyms.
- The mapping is extensive and designed to underpin accurate species-level attribution across multiple vegetation layers, including canopy, sub-canopy, seedlings, and ground flora.
- Examples illustrate the complexity of taxonomic names and their aliases, showing how a single code can correspond to multiple accepted names or synonyms (e.g., Salix cinerea ssp oleifolia(c) linked to various Salix and related taxa).
- The crosswalk supports data integration and consistency across ECN vegetation protocols, enabling standardized analyses across canopy and understorey components.
- Quality and metadata context:
  - The ECN uses standardized quality codes to describe data reliability and collection circumstances (e.g., codes 100–513, with 999 for unusual events).
  - Quality codes are assigned by site managers and correspond to specific conditions such as data loss, sampling issues, debris, weather effects, or other disturbances.
  - Quality information accompanies the dataset to guide correct interpretation and analysis.
- Purpose for analysts:
  - Ensures consistent species identification and naming conventions across long-term monitoring.
  - Facilitates cross-protocol and multi-dataset analyses by providing a stable taxonomic framework and accompanying quality metadata.
