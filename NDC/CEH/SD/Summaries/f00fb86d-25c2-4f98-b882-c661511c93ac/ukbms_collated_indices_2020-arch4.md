# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Key purpose and governance
- Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Provides annual data on butterfly population status from a nationwide, site-based monitoring program.
- Supports understanding biodiversity trends and informs policy questions.
- Represents a long-running effort (since 1976) with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.
- Data are shared to support broader data initiatives and collaboration.

## Data collection methods
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects at sites chosen by recorders; 2–4 km long; 45 minutes to 2 hours; 26 counts per year (weekly April–September) in a 5 m band; ~2,000 sites sampled annually.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares; two parallel transects per square; 2–3 visits per year (minimum 2 in July/August); sampling farmland and common habitats; ~800 squares sampled annually.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species during their flight period.

## Nature of data and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Indices reflect a constant proportion observed at a site; detectability varies by species.
- Collated species indices produced with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) plus weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year/site.
- All counts across different methods integrate to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps; observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

## Quality control and data validation
- Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators validate records; ongoing checks throughout the season.
- Further automated/manual validation includes cross-checks against known distributions, flight periods, first-time site records, and unusual abundances; corrections or queries resolved with coordinators.

## Data download: contents and format
- Annual collated indices for species with sufficient data, 1976–2020 (some early years lack indices for certain species).
- File format: CSV.
- Key columns:
  - SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME
  - YEAR
  - NO. SITES (sites contributing to the index)
  - COLLATED INDEX (log10 of the Collated Index, scaled so the long-term mean equals 2)
  - YEAR RANK (relative performance year for the species)
  - TIME PERIOD
  - COUNTRY (regional index data source)
