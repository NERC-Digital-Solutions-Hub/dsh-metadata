# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- The UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Volunteers contribute data; annual data tracks butterfly population status across the UK.
- Sampling framework includes Pollard walks (wide-scale transects), stratified-random WCBS transects, and targeted surveys.
- The scheme has monitored butterfly abundance since 1976 with data from over 2,500 active sites annually.
- All sampling methods are analyzed together to understand trends and inform biodiversity policy questions.

## Data collection components
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks):
  - Fixed-route transects (2–4 km) with weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year) in a 5 m wide band.
  - Typically 45 minutes to two hours per walk; almost 2,000 sites sampled yearly.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS):
  - Stratified-random 1 km squares; two parallel transects per square; 2–3 visits/year (minimum two in July/August; spring visits encouraged).
  - About 800 squares sampled annually.
- Targeted surveys:
  - Single-species transects and alternative methods focused on specific species.
  - Timed counts and egg/larval web counts for focal species.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Site indices are weighted to reflect a constant proportional presence; some species are harder to detect than others.
- Collated indices for each species are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a 2016 modification weighting site data by the proportion of the flight period surveyed that year.
- All seasonal counts (Pollard walks, reduced methods, WCBS) are integrated to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps; observed data are weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

## Quality control
- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Automatic checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators validate records; ongoing checks throughout the season.
- Additional automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range distributions, unusual first-time records, and abnormal abundances.
- Corrections are applied through queries and coordination with recorders/coordinators.

## Details of this data download
- Provides annual collated indices of abundance for species with sufficient data from 1976–2020 (early years may be missing for some species).
- Data format: comma-separated values (.csv).
- Columns include: SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (log10), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
- COLLATED INDEX is log10-transformed and scaled so the series average equals 2, enabling relative comparisons over time.

## Licence and attribution statement
- Data released under Open Government Licence (OGL) with few conditions.
