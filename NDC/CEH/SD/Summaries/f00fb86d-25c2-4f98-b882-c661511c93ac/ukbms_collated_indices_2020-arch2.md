# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## What it is and who runs it
- Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Volunteer-based data collection with annual population-status data across the UK.
- Since 1976, monitoring a broad network (currently over 2,500 active sites per year).
- All sampling methods are analyzed together to support understanding of insect population trends and biodiversity policy questions.
- UKBMS data and outputs are available via the scheme’s website and associated resources.

## Data collection framework
- Three sampling components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts (ideally 26 counts/year) across multiple habitat sections.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year; sampling common habitats (e.g., farmland).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species.
- Data capture involves field forms, online entry, and storage in a central database.

## Data types and trend analysis
- Outputs are abundance indices: relative measures of population size based on counts within transect sections/sites.
- Site indices feed into species-level collated indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a site-year weighting that reflects the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed.
- The seasonal pattern is estimated from all counts (Pollard walks, WCBS, and reduced surveys) to extrapolate gaps; observed data are weighted to dominate final indices.

## Quality control and data validation
- Field data recorded on standard forms and uploaded via UKBMS or Transect Walker; automated checks flag data-entry issues.
- Regional transect coordinators validate records; validation continues throughout the season.
- Additional automated/manual checks screen for: records outside known distribution, out-of-season records, first-time site records, extreme or anomalous counts.
- Corrections and edits are made in the main UKBMS dataset after coordination and queries.

## Data download details
- Provides annual collated indices of abundance for species with sufficient data from 1976–2020.
- Data delivered as a CSV file with columns:
  - SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (log10, scaled so the series average equals 2), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
- Some early years may lack collated indices due to insufficient data.

## Licence, attribution and reuse
- Data provided under Open Government Licence (OGL).
- Must cite the dataset with the DOI in any reports/publications describing analyses using the data.
- Attribution statement: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.

## Collaboration and contact
- UKBMS Partners offer guidance on dataset details and interpretation; opportunities for co-authorship and intellectual input.
