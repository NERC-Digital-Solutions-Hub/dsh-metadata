# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- A collaborative program organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with contributions from volunteers.
- In operation since 1976, providing annual population status data for butterflies across the UK.
- More than 2,500 sites actively recorded each year; data from all sampling methods are analyzed together.
- A key resource for understanding insect population changes and informing biodiversity policy.

## Data collection framework

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide belt, 26 counts per year (April–September), weekly; around 2,000 sites sampled annually.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares; two parallel 1 km transects with 10 sections; 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August), sampling ~800 squares annually.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods such as timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species.
- All components contribute to a unified UKBMS dataset used to monitor butterfly abundance.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- Use abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present; detectability varies by species.
- Collated indices per species/year are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with site-level weighting based on the proportion of the species flight period observed that year.
- All seasonal counts (Pollard walks, WCBS, and reduced surveys) are used to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps; observed data are given more weight than extrapolated data.

## Quality control

- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data site or Transect Walker.
- Automatic checks flag unusual counts or records outside known flight periods; regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
- Further automated and manual validation checks for: distribution range (against BNMs and UKBMS data), flight period timing, first records at a site, extreme or inconsistent abundances.
- Data corrections are made through queries and coordinated edits to the main UKBMS dataset.

## Data download details

- Dataset covers 1976–2020 with annual collated indices for species with sufficient data.
- Provided as a CSV with columns:
  - SPECIES CODE (unique species number)
  - SPECIES (scientific name)
  - COMMON NAME
  - YEAR
  - NO. SITES (sites contributing to the index)
  - COLLATED INDEX (log10 CI; scaled so the series average is 2)
  - YEAR RANK (1 = best year for that species)
  - TIME PERIOD (data period used for the index)
  - COUNTRY (region of the data)
- Some earlier years may not have collated indices due to insufficient data.
- Open Government Licence (OGL) applies; attribution and citation requirements must be followed.
