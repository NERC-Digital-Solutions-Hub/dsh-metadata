# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Governance and purpose
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - It relies on volunteers and aims to provide annual data on butterfly population status to inform policy questions related to biodiversity status and trends.

- Sampling framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects at sites chosen by recorders, monitored weekly up to 26 times per year; ~2000 sites sampled annually.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1km squares with two parallel transects, 2-3 visits per year (plus spring visits encouraged); ~800 squares sampled annually.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or habitats.
  - Data from all sampling methods are analyzed together to assess status and trends.

- Data and trend analysis
  - Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population counts.
  - Collated indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a weighting adjustment that accounts for the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site/year.
  - The method uses all counts in a season to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate to gaps, giving greater influence to observed (rather than extrapolated) data.

- Quality control
  - Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker software.
  - Automated checks flag potential data entry errors; regional transect coordinators validate records throughout the season.
  - Further automated and manual validation checks assess records for out-of-range distributions, unusual flight periods, first-time site records, and anomalous abundances; necessary edits are made to the main dataset through coordinated queries.

- Data download details
  - The download provides annual collated indices of abundance for species with sufficient data from 1976–2020 (earlier years may be incomplete).
  - Delivered as a CSV with columns: SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (Log 10 Collated Index), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
  - Collated indices are scaled so the average across the series equals 2, enabling relative comparisons over time.
  - References used for species names and nomenclature are provided within the metadata.

- Licence and attribution
  - Data are provided under an Open Government Licence (OGL).
  - Citations (including the DOI) must be included in any reports/publications using the data.
  - An attribution statement must accompany any information or images derived from the data, crediting UKBMS partners.

- Collaboration and contact
  - UKBMS partners offer advisory support and interpretation of outputs.
  - Opportunities for co-authorship and intellectual input are available for publications or presentations resulting from UKBMS data.
