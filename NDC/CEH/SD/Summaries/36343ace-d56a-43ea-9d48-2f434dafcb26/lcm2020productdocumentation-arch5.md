# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020 1.0, Date = 10/09/2021. 1.0, Updates = First version

## Purpose and scope
- User guide for the UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020 (LCM2020).
- Product consists of six geospatial datasets across Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
- Aims to enable informed use by describing data production, validation, and data accuracy; supports data discovery and proper data governance for large-scale datasets.

## Data products included
- 10m Classified Pixel datasets: classified pixels from Classification Scenes with a Rand Forest classifier; first band = most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class; second band = classification probability.
- Land Parcel datasets: generated by intersecting 10m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to produce parcel-level attributes.
- 25m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets: rasterised parcel-level outputs (per Land Parcel Framework) carrying per-parcel attributes (mode, conf, purity).
- 8-bit Raster Products: raster outputs corresponding to Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI), with related metadata (extent, CRS, bands).
- Seasonal Composite Images and Context Rasters: inputs used for classification; Seasonal Composite Images derived from Sentinel-2; Context Rasters provide terrain, proximity, and land-cover context to reduce spectral confusion.
- Classification Scenes: 100x100 km tiles (GB) or single NI scene used to train and classify 46/43-band inputs; scenes are overlapped to ensure robust training distributions.

## Data production workflow and methods
- Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images (winter, spring, summer, autumn) combined with 10 Context Rasters to form Classification Scenes.
- Bootstrap Training: fully automatic training method using historic LCM data (LCM2017–2019) to sample training observations, reducing the need for new field data.
- Random Forest classifier: trained with balanced sampling across classes; 10,000 samples per class from labelled bags; outputs 10m Classified Pixel product.
- Processing architecture: bespoke software integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL; fully open-source components.
- Spatial tiling and regional approach: GB classified using 100x100 km tiles; NI uses a single Classification Scene for year-specific classification due to smaller area.
- Temporal strategy: annual map production to maximize temporal consistency and change detection; historic maps feed Bootstrap Training to adapt to new imagery.

## Data framework and geography
- UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework: fixed parcel geometries with a minimum area ~0.5 ha (MMU); parcels are designed to represent discrete land units (fields, parks, etc.) and support change detection over time.
- Coordinate reference systems: GB parcels in EPSG:27700 (OSGB36); NI parcels in EPSG:29903 (TM75 Irish Grid).
- GID and identifiers: a note that parcel identifiers (gid) do not match LCM2015 due to reordering and indexing changes; users comparing with LCM2015 by parcel ID should expect non-direct correspondence.
- Data accuracy and validation: Appendix 4 provides a formal validation matrix; overall accuracy is 79.2% at full thematic detail (based on 34,715 validation points).

## Validation and quality assessment
- Validation dataset: 34,715 points across GB countryside survey data (2019/2020), open-source forest inventory data, IACS data, and bespoke validation points.
- Validation outcome: overall accuracy 79.2% (Appendix 4); producer and user accuracies reported by class in the detailed matrices.
- Validation note: LCM2020 validation is aligned with Landsat/Sentinel-based outputs and parcel-level references; classification errors are expected to be largely random and mitigated over time with the time-series series.

## Class definitions and harmonisation with BAP
- UKCEH Land Cover Classes: 21 classes derived from Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats; not a strict one-to-one mapping with BAP Broad Habitats.
- Appendices 1 and 2 outline relationships and nuances between UKCEH classes and BAP Broad Habitats; UK BAP terms are italicised when explicitly used.
- Appendix 1/2 provides guidance on interpreting overlaps and potential spectral confusion between similar habitat types; several notes on typical misclassifications and context-based improvements (e.g., spectral confusion between arable and improved grassland, peatland-related vegetation, etc.).

## Data relationships and visualization
- Appendix 3 provides a recommended color recipe for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes (RGB values per class).
- Appendix 4 includes the full correspondence matrices (class-by-class confusion) between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and UK BAP Broad Habitats, including user and producer accuracies.
- Appendix 5 lists the official dataset names and citations for each of the six UKCEH LCM2020 datasets (GB and Northern Ireland variants).

## Data accessibility, governance, and usage guidance
- Dataset descriptions and extents are explicitly defined; the 10m pixel datasets preserve detailed landscape features not generalised by the Land Parcel Framework to support high-resolution analyses.
- Users should be aware that formal validation was conducted against the Land Parcel dataset, not the 10m Classified Pixels, so interpretation of accuracy in the pixel layer should consider this distinction.
- The UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework’s MMU and parcel-based approach facilitate robust change detection but may complicate cross-map comparisons when parcel identifiers differ across map versions.
- The document emphasizes continuous methodological improvement; annual production aims to separate random errors from real-world change, enabling reliable long-term monitoring.

## Key cautions for data stewards
- Be mindful of potential data gaps due to cloud cover in Seasonal Composite Images; the classification scenes were designed to tolerate partial spectral information.
- Recognize spectral confusion among classes (e.g., arable vs improved grassland, peatland-related classes) and rely on Context Rasters and parcel-level attributes to bolster discrimination.
- Note the differences in data structure and IDs between LCM2020 and earlier maps (LCM2015) when performing longitudinal comparisons; mapping by spatial overlap may be more reliable than by direct gid matching.
- Annual updates will adjust classifications; maintain versioning and document method changes to ensure reproducibility and auditability.

## Summary of significance for data governance
- LCM2020 provides a comprehensive, regularly updated, parcel-aware land cover dataset suite with clear provenance, validation, and documentation to support data discovery, governance, and reuse.
- The combination of high-resolution 10m pixels, parcel-level attributes, and 25m rasterized land parcels enables both detailed local analyses and scalable national assessments.
- Clear metadata, classifier methodology (Bootstrap Training, Random Forest), and validation metrics support quality assurance, traceability, and responsible data sharing within organisations managing large, multi-user dataset ecosystems.
