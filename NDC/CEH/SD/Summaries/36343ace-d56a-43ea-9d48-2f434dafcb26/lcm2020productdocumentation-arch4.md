# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020

- Purpose and scope
  - LCM2020 is the eighth UK land cover map produced by UK CEH, designed for annual production with continuous improvements.
  - Product comprises six datasets across GB and Northern Ireland: for each region, a 10m Classified Pixels dataset, a Land Parcel dataset, and a 25m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset.

- Data production and pipeline
  - Land cover is mapped into 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (linked to Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats but not identical).
  - Classification uses Classification Scenes formed from Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images plus 10 Context Raster layers.
  - Bootstrap Training (automatic training data) combined with a Random Forest classifier to produce the 10m Classified Pixels.
  - 25m Rasterised Land Parcels are generated by intersecting the 10m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.

- Seasonal data and Classification Scenes
  - Sentinel-2 seasonal composites (winter, spring, summer, autumn) provide spectral information; nine bands used (bands 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11,12) with some gaps due to cloud.
  - For GB: 100x100 km tiles yield 36-band Seasonal Composite Images, combined with 46-band Context Rasters to create overlapping Classification Scenes (74 scenes total across GB).
  - For Northern Ireland: a single 43-band Classification Scene per year (36-band Sentinel-2 plus NI Context Rasters).
  - Classification Scenes are trained and classified independently; overlaps are resolved by a manual precedence step.

- Context rasters (spectral disambiguation)
  - GB 10m Context Rasters include: height, aspect, slope; distances to buildings, roads, sea, freshwater; foreshore and tidal masks; woodland mask.
  - NI 10m Context Rasters include: height, aspect, slope; urban mask; distance to coast, freshwater, road.
  - Context layers help distinguish spectrally similar classes (e.g., rocks, urban surfaces, coastal vs inland).

- Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Parcellation framework built to generalise national cartography; minimum parcel size ~0.5 ha (MMU).
  - Parcels are used to aggregate 10m pixels for a cleaner product and for change detection; gid identifiers differ from LCM2015, complicating direct parcel-id comparisons.

- Bootstrap Training and Random Forest methodology
  - Bootstrap Training uses historic LCMs (2017–2019) as training data; parcels with >99% purity across three years are included.
  - Training data: ~941,027 GB parcels; ~214,833 NI parcels.
  - Random Forest classifier trained with 10,000 samples per class (with replacement) to balance class representation.
  - Output: 10m Classified Pixels (two-band: class ID and confidence/probability).

- 25m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Rasterised per-parcel outputs at 25m resolution with three bands: dominant class (_mode), mean confidence (_conf), and parcel purity (_purity).

- Dataset details and formats
  - GB datasets use British National Grid (EPSG: 27700); Northern Ireland datasets use Irish Grid (EPSG: 29903).
  - 10m Pixel datasets are un-generalised to preserve fine-scale features; 25m rasters align with the Land Parcel Framework.
  - Appendix 5 provides the official dataset names and metadata for all six datasets.

- Validation and accuracy
  - Validation against GB countryside survey data (2019/2020), National Forest Inventory, IACS, and bespoke LCM validation points (total 34,715 points).
  - Overall accuracy: 79.2% (full thematic detail) across the product (Appendix 4).

- Product validation and limitations
  - No manual regional corrections are performed to enable annual updates; problems are noted for future methodological improvements.
  - Annual time-series help distinguish real change from random classification noise (random errors expected to flicker over time).

- Relationship to biodiversity classifications
  - The 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are aligned with but not identical to UK BAP Broad Habitats.
  - Appendices explain the mapping nuances, color standards for display, and considerations when relating land cover classes to BAP Broad Habitats.

- Practical notes for data leaders
  - The data system is designed to support continual improvement, temporal change detection, and cross-regional comparability.
  - The combination of high-detail 10m pixels and fixed 0.5 ha MMU land parcels enables both detailed analysis and robust time-series comparisons.
  - Rigorous validation provides a clear performance benchmark, with attention to potential class confusion clarified in the appendices.
