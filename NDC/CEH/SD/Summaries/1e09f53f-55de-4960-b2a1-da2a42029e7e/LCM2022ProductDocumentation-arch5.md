# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2022

## Aim and scope
- Annual UK land cover map (LCM2022) produced by UKCEH to monitor state and change of the UK countryside.
- 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes based on Biodiversity Broad Habitats (BAP) alignments, derived from Sentinel-2 seasonal imagery with context layers.
- Product supports monitoring, change detection, and decision-making; formal validation reports overall accuracy.

## Product suite and dataset descriptions
- Seven geospatial datasets plus a 1 km summary raster product:
  - 10 m Classified Pixels (GB and Northern Ireland): per-pixel land cover class with a second band for classification confidence; preserves 10 m detail (no generalisation to land parcel framework).
  - Land Parcel Product (GB and NI): vectors generated by intersecting 10 m pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework; parcel-level attributes including density, mode, confidence, and overlap metrics.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel Product (GB and NI): rasterised per parcel with three bands: dominant land cover (mode), mean confidence, and parcel purity.
  - 1 km Summary Raster Product (GB and NI): dominant class and percentage cover for each 1 km pixel (both 21-class and 10-class aggregations); slight rounding may affect sums near 100%.
- Geographic scope: Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI); 10 m and 25 m products have GB and NI variants; 1 km summaries cover GB and NI combined.
- Coordinate systems: GB = British National Grid (EPSG: 27700); NI = Irish Grid TM75 (EPSG: 29903).

## Data production and methodology
- Classification approach:
  - Bootstrap Training: automatic training set derived from historic LCMs (LCM2019–LCM2021) for classifier training; selects high-probability pixels consistently classified across years to train the model.
  - Random Forest classifier: balanced sampling (10,000 samples per bootstrap bag) to avoid dominance by common classes.
  - Classification Scenes: GB uses 32 tiles (~100 x 100 km) to manage regional phenology; NI uses a single 49-band Classification Scene.
- Input data layers:
  - Seasonal Composite Images: Sentinel-2 based four-season composites (January–March, April–June, July–September, October–December) with 10 spectral bands (plus some high-level details); occasional cloud gaps do not prevent full UK coverage.
  - Context Rasters: 10 GB rasters (height, aspect, slope, distances to buildings/roads/tidal water/freshwater, foreshore mask, woodland mask, saltmarsh mask); 9 NI rasters (similar plus urban mask and distance to coast/roads).
- The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework:
  - Parcel MMU ≈ 0.5 ha; parcels derived from generalized national cartography and designed to capture discrete land units; parcels help reduce classification noise and enable change detection.
  - GID identifiers may not align with LCM2015 due to updates in storage indices.
- Validation and quality:
  - Validation dataset: 33,107 reference points across 21 classes; overall accuracy reported at 86.1%.
  - Product validation against 25 m rasterised parcels; some issues noted for vector parcels (small polygons missing) with negligible impact on 1 km products.

## Data governance, quality, and updates
- Data governance: datasets released with DOIs; intended for discovery, sharing, and reuse; text notes ongoing methodological evolution to improve accuracy and temporal consistency.
- Update cycle: annual production; improvements may be applied across the full catalog when warranted to maximize comparability and support change detection.
- Known issues:
  - Some polygons missing from vector land parcel products, creating nodata areas in corresponding 25 m rasters; effect on 1 km products is negligible; 10 m pixels datasets are unaffected.
- Citations and provenance:
  - Each dataset has DOIs; referenced sources include Marston et al. (2024a–g) and Marston et al. (2023) for LCM2021 overview.

## Access, usage, and citation
- Data products are issued with DOIs and should be cited accordingly; specific DOIs and references are provided for:
  - 10 m Classified Pixels (GB and NI)
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels (GB and NI)
  - Land Parcel (vector) datasets
  - 1 km Summary Rasters
- Overview documentation and production methodology references available (e.g., Marston et al., 2023; Marston et al., 2024a–g).
- Disclaimer: minor methodological differences across recent annual maps mean some observed changes may reflect method changes as well as real land-cover change.

## Display and metadata guidance
- Appendix notes include:
  - Relationship mappings between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats (for consistent interpretation and legacy compatibility).
  - Recommended colour recipes for displaying land cover classes (including color-blind friendly options) and accompanying QGIS symbology files.
  - Detailed class descriptions and notes on common spectral confusion (e.g., between arable, improved grassland, neutral grassland, and various vegetation classes) to support interpretation and metadata quality.

## Practical notes for data stewards
- Ensure proper metadata enrichment with:
  - Dataset-level DOIs and references, region (GB/NI), resolution, bands, and accuracy metrics.
  - Clear notes about classification methodology (Bootstrap Training, RF), input layers (Seasonal Composite Images, Context Rasters), and the Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - Explicit statements about known issues (e.g., vector parcel gaps) and their impact on downstream products.
- Maintain data governance alignment by:
  - Tracking updates and versioning for annual releases.
  - Providing guidance on appropriate usage in time-series analyses to distinguish real change from methodological shifts.
  - Supplying display palettes and tools (e.g., lcm_raster.qml, lcm_raster_cb_friendly.qml) to support consistent visualization and accessibility.
