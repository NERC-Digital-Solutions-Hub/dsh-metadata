# Experimental design/sampling regime

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) collects data from over 2,000 sites per year across the UK, using standardized methods to estimate butterfly abundance.
- Main sampling approaches:
  - All-species transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km, 26 weekly counts Apr–Sep, 5 m wide recording band; routes fixed to enable year-to-year comparability; weather- and time-window constraints (10:45–15:45; suitable butterfly activity).
  - Single-species transects: follow all-species methodology but recorded only for focal species during select weeks.
  - Timed counts and egg/larval web counts: species counts over fixed periods/areas or counts of eggs/larval webs in suitable habitat.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): reduced-effort sampling along two parallel 1-km transects within randomly selected 1-km squares; 2–4 visits per year (min 2 visits in Jul/Aug), spring visits encouraged.
- Data collection in the field uses standard forms; online entry via UKBMS MyData or Transect Walker software; regional transect coordinators consolidate data for their region.

- Data governance and ownership:
  - Each transect is managed by a regional coordinator responsible for data from their sites; data are uploaded to a centralized Oracle database.
  - Data quality checks are integrated at multiple stages (field-level validations, regional checks, and automated/manual validation post-entry).

- Data accessibility and standards:
  - Species and site data are standardized using accepted taxonomic references (SCI_NAME from Fauna Europaea; common names per Emmet & Heath).
  - The workflow supports ongoing data access for analysis and reporting, with documented processes for updating and incorporating new data.

- Practical constraints and sampling windows:
  - Sampling occurs during periods suitable for butterfly activity (weather conditions such as low wind, adequate temperature, and daylight).
  - Temporal scope and site coverage influence the completeness and comparability of indices and trends over time.

- Relation to data strategy and collaboration:
  - The design supports long-term, consistent data series across sites, enabling collaboration across regions and with the wider data community.
  - Fixed transects and standardized timing facilitate monitoring consistency, while WCBS expands coverage into wider countryside habitats.

- Data gaps and planning considerations for data leaders:
  - Data gaps arise from uneven site participation across years, leading to missing values that require statistical imputation and modeling.
  - The design acknowledges variations in detectability across species, habitats, and years, informing prioritization of data collection and methodological refinements.
