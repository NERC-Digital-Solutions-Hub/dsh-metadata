# Soil temperature profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Study of soil temperature profiles measured during summer in 2013 and 2014.
- Measurements taken at the same locations where soil cores were extracted.
- Focus on temperatures from 0 to 20 cm, with deeper measurements at various sites.
- Sites cover a range of forested and peatland environments in subarctic Canada (13 sites total).

## Site codes and descriptions
- FFU — FireFox Unburnt. An unburnt black spruce forest
- BLF — BlackFox. A black spruce forest
- WHF — WhiteFox. A white spruce forest
- TPP — Teslin Peatland Plateau. A peatland plateau near Teslin
- TW — Teslin Wetland. A thawed peatland plateau
- MCU — Mosquito Creek Unburnt. An unburnt black spruce forest
- MCB — Mosquito Creek Burnt. A burnt black spruce forest
- WTP — White Truck Plateau. A peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- WTM — White Truck Moss. A recently thawed peatland plateau dominated by moss vegetation
- WTS — White Truck Sedge. A recently thawed peatland plateau dominated by sedge and moss vegetation
- WTW — White Truck Wetland. A potentially older collapse feature (thawed peatland plateau)
- BCB — Boundary Creek Birch. A birch forest
- BCS — Boundary Creek Spruce. A black spruce forest

## Measurement methods by depth and site
- 0–20 cm: Measured with a conventional electronic thermometer inserted directly into the soil.
- Deeper temperatures (variable by site):
  - For FFU, BLF, WHF, TPP, TW, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS:
    - Use a plastic tube sealed at the bottom, inserted into the hole left after soil core sampling.
    - Replenish the hole with the same soil.
    - Fill the tube with antifreeze and cap the top.
    - Insert a cable with a thermistor into the tube; allow equilibration, then record resistance at depth.
    - Convert resistance to temperature (0°C corresponds to 7355 ohms).
    - Thermistors calibrated in ice bath to account for drift.
  - For WTM, WTS, WTW:
    - Deeper temperatures monitored with a Rototherm probe.
    - Probe: 1.3 m stainless steel tube; sensing tip is a platinum resistor (100 Ω at 0°C; 4-wire, Class B, IEC 751).
    - Measurements made with a hand-held digital thermometer.
    - Probe specifications: tolerance ±0.3°C.

## Data handling and calibration
- Resistance values converted to Celsius using established calibration.
- Drift and accuracy addressed via ice-bath calibration of thermistors.
- Data collection designed to maintain soil contact and representative profiles across depths.

## General notes for analysts
- Measurements standardized across multiple sites to enable comparability.
- Method selection depends on site type and depth, with clear procedures for tube-based deep measurements or Rototherm probe deployment.
- Spatial and temporal context (multiple sites, two summers) supports environmental monitoring and trend analysis over time.
