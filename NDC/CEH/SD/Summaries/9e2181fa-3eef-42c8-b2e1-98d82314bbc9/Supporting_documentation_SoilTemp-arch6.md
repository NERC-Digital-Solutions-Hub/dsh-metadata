# Soil temperature profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Objective: Report soil temperature profiles measured in summer 2013 and 2014 at the same locations where soil cores were extracted, covering multiple site types across subarctic Canada.

- Sites (codes and habitats):
  - FFU - FireFox Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
  - BLF - BlackFox: black spruce forest
  - WHF - WhiteFox: white spruce forest
  - TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin
  - TW - Teslin Wetland: thawed peatland plateau
  - MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
  - MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: burnt black spruce forest
  - WTP - White Truck Plateau: peatland plateau near Yellowknife
  - WTM - White Truck Moss: thawed peatland plateau with moss vegetation
  - WTS - White Truck Sedge: thawed peatland plateau with sedge/moss
  - WTW - White Truck Wetland: older thaw feature (thawed peatland plateau)
  - BCB - Boundary Creek Birch: birch forest
  - BCS - Boundary Creek Spruce: black spruce forest

- Depth and data types:
  - 0–20 cm: soil temperatures measured with a conventional electronic thermometer inserted into the soil.
  - Deeper temperatures: measured using two distinct approaches depending on site.

- Deep temperature measurement methods:
  - For FFU, BLF, WHF, TPP, TW, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS:
    - Insert a sealed-bottom plastic tube into the hole left after soil coring; fill with the same soil and antifreeze; cap top.
    - Remove cap and insert a thermistor-equipped cable; place thermistor at various depths and allow equilibration.
    - Convert thermistor resistance to temperature; zero Celsius corresponds to 7355 ohms.
    - Thermistor drift calibration established by placing them in an ice bath prior to use.
    - Equipment: thermistor connected to a hand‑held multimeter (Fluke 289).
  - For WTM, WTS, WTW:
    - Use a Rototherm probe: 1.3 m stainless steel tube with a 7 mm sensing tip and a platinum resistor (100 Ω at 0°C, 4-wire, Class B, IEC 751).
    - Temperature readings taken via a hand-held digital thermometer.

- Calibration and data processing:
  - Resistance-to-Celsius conversions performed for thermistors; calibration drift characterized with ice-bath measurements for each thermistor.
  - Deeper-temperature methods differ by site, enabling continuous profile construction at depth ranges beyond 0–20 cm.

- Data collection period:
  - Summer seasons of 2013 and 2014.

- Equipment and specifications (summary):
  - 0–20 cm: conventional electronic thermometer.
  - Deeper soils (majority of sites): plastic-tube method with thermistor and Fluke 289 multimeter; antifreeze-filled tube; ice-bath calibration.
  - Deeper soils (WTM, WTS, WTW): Rototherm stainless-steel probe with platinum resistor; handheld digital thermometer.
  - Calibration: ice-bath drift measurements performed for each thermistor to ensure accurate resistance-to-temperature conversion.
