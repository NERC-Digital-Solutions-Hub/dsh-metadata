# Soil temperature profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Temperature profiles measured during summer 2013 and 2014 at the same locations where soil cores were extracted.
- Depths: 0–20 cm using a conventional electronic thermometer; deeper temperatures monitored with site-specific methods.

## Sites and Codes
- FFU – FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
- BLF – BlackFox (black spruce forest)
- WHF – WhiteFox (white spruce forest)
- TPP – Teslin Peatland Plateau (peatland plateau near Teslin)
- TW – Teslin Wetland (thawed peatland plateau)
- MCU – Mosquito Creek Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
- MCB – Mosquito Creek Burnt (burnt black spruce forest)
- WTP – White Truck Plateau (peatland near Yellowknife)
- WTM – White Truck Moss (thawed peatland plateau dominated by moss)
- WTS – White Truck Sedge (thawed peatland plateau with sedge and moss)
- WTW – White Truck Wetland (older collapse feature, thawed peatland plateau)
- BCB – Boundary Creek Birch (birch forest)
- BCS – Boundary Creek Spruce (black spruce forest)

## Measurement Methods

- 0–20 cm depth
  - Measured with a conventional electronic thermometer inserted into the soil.

- Deeper soil temperatures (two approaches):
  - Method A (sites FFU, BLF, WHF, TPP, TW, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS)
    - Plastic tube sealed at the bottom inserted into the hole from soil coring.
    - Hole replenished with the same soil; tube filled with antifreeze and capped at the top.
    - Thermistor attached to a cable is lowered into the tube; equilibrates to a constant resistance before recording.
    - Resistance readings converted to °C.
    - 0 °C corresponds to 7355 ohms; drift calibrated using ice bath data (pre-recorded).
    - Measured with a Fluke 289 multimeter.
  - Method B (sites WTM, WTS, WTW)
    - Rototherm probe: 1.3 m stainless steel tube, 11 mm outer diameter, 7 mm inner diameter, with a 300 mm wide T-handle for insertion/removal.
    - Sensing tip contains a platinum resistor (100 Ω at 0 °C; 4-wire; Class B; IEC 751).
    - Temperature read via a hand-held digital thermometer.

## Data Processing and Calibration
- Temperature values from resistance readings are converted to Celsius using established calibration.
- Calibration reference: 0 °C corresponds to 7355 Ω; drift characterized via ice-bath calibration.
- Equilibration assumed when resistance readings stabilized.
- 4-wire measurement used for accuracy (Rototherm method).

## Temporal and Instrumentation Notes
- Data collected in summers 2013 and 2014.
- Two distinct deep-temperature monitoring systems used, depending on site, which has implications for data harmonization and cross-site comparability.
- Documentation includes instrument specifics (Fluke 289 for tube method; Rototherm/platinum resistor for Rototherm method) and probe geometries.
