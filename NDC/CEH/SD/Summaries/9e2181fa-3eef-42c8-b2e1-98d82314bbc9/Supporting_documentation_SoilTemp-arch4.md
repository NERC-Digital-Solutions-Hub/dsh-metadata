# Soil temperature profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Summer measurements in 2013 and 2014 at the same locations where soil cores were extracted
- Site codes and vegetation/types:
  - FFU - FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
  - BLF - BlackFox (black spruce forest)
  - WHF - WhiteFox (white spruce forest)
  - TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau (peatland plateau near Teslin)
  - TW - Teslin Wetland (thawed peatland plateau)
  - MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
  - MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt (burnt black spruce forest)
  - WTP - White Truck Plateau (peatland plateau near Yellowknife)
  - WTM - White Truck Moss (recently thawed peatland plateau dominated by moss)
  - WTS - White Truck Sedge (recently thawed peatland plateau dominated by sedge and moss)
  - WTW - White Truck Wetland (potentially older collapse feature, thawed peatland plateau)
  - BCB - Boundary Creek Birch (birch forest)
  - BCS - Boundary Creek Spruce (black spruce forest)

- Depths and data collection
  - 0–20 cm: measured with a conventional electronic soil thermometer inserted directly into the soil
  - Deeper temperatures (beyond 20 cm) used two approaches depending on site:
    - For FFU, BLF, WHF, TPP, TW, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS:
      - Plastic tube sealed at the bottom inserted into the hole left after soil coring
      - Hole refilled with the same soil
      - Tube filled with antifreeze; capped at the top
      - Thermistor lowered into the tube; equilibrated to a constant resistance
      - Resistance read with a multimeter (Fluke 289); converted to °C
      - Zero °C corresponds to 7355 ohms; drift of this relation recorded in an ice bath for calibration
    - For WTM, WTS, WTW:
      - Rototherm probe used (1.3 m stainless steel tube; 11 mm outer, 7 mm inner diameter)
      - Sensing tip 7 mm, sharpened to a point; contains a platinum resistor (100 Ω at 0°C, 4-wire, Class B, IEC 751)
      - Measured with a handheld digital thermometer
      - Manufacturer-stated tolerance for the sensor: ±0.3 °C

- Data handling and calibration
  - Temperature values are reported in degrees Celsius
  - Deeper-temperature methods rely on established calibration procedures (ice bath drift) to ensure accuracy
  - Different deep-measurement technologies across sites highlight the importance of method metadata for data comparability

- Data quality and considerations for data strategy
  - Method variation by site may affect cross-site comparability of deeper temperature profiles
  - Availability of calibration details (ice bath drift) supports traceability and uncertainty assessment
  - Documentation of equipment, installation procedure, and sensing depths helps enable reproducibility and future data integration across networks or partners
