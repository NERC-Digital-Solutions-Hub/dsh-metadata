# Soil temperature profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Soil temperature profiles measured during the summers of 2013 and 2014 at the same locations where soil cores were extracted.
- Sites cover a range of forest types and peatland plateaus, identified by coded labels (e.g., FFU, BLF, WHF, TPP, TW, etc.).

## Sites (Site Codes and Descriptions)
- FFU: FireFox Unburnt — an unburnt black spruce forest
- BLF: BlackFox — a black spruce forest
- WHF: WhiteFox — a white spruce forest
- TPP: Teslin Peatland Plateau — a peatland plateau near Teslin
- TW: Teslin Wetland — a thawed peatland plateau
- MCU: Mosquito Creek Unburnt — an unburnt black spruce forest
- MCB: Mosquito Creek Burnt — a burnt black spruce forest
- WTP: White Truck Plateau — a peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- WTM: White Truck Moss — a recently thawed peatland plateau dominated by moss
- WTS: White Truck Sedge — a recently thawed peatland plateau with sedge and moss
- WTW: White Truck Wetland — a potentially older thaw feature (thawed peatland plateau)
- BCB: Boundary Creek Birch — a birch forest
- BCS: Boundary Creek Spruce — a black spruce forest

## Measurement Methods
- 0–20 cm depth: temperature measured with a conventional electronic thermometer inserted in the soil.
- Deeper temperatures (beyond 20 cm): measured using two approaches depending on site.
  - For FFU, BLF, WHF, TPP, TW, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS:
    - A plastic tube sealed at the bottom is inserted into the hole left after soil core sampling; the hole is replenished with the same soil.
    - The tube is filled with antifreeze and capped at the top.
    - A cable with a thermistor is lowered into the tube; at each depth, the thermistor equilibrates and resistance is recorded with a multimeter (Fluke 289).
    - Resistance values are converted to degrees Celsius.
    - Zero degrees Celsius corresponds to 7355 ohms; drift of this relation was previously recorded for each thermistor using an ice bath.
  - For WTM, WTS, WTW:
    - A Rototherm probe is used: 1.3 m stainless steel tube (11 mm outer, 7 mm inner), with a 300 mm wide T-handle.
    - Sensing tip is 7 mm, containing a platinum resistor (100 Ω at 0°C, 4-wire, Class B, IEC 751; tolerance ±0.3°C).
    - Temperatures are measured by connecting the probe to a handheld digital thermometer.

## Data Processing and Calibration
- Temperature readings are derived by converting electrical resistance to temperature (via established calibration curves).
- Calibration and drift checks are conducted (e.g., ice bath verification for thermistors) to ensure accuracy.

## Timeline and Sampling Details
- Measurements conducted during summers of 2013 and 2014.
- Sites correspond to locations where soil cores were previously collected, enabling paired core and temperature profile data.
