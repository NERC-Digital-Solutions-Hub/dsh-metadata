# Grassland arthropod trait and associated environmental data collected in arable reversion sites in southern England, 2014

- A 2014 study sampling arthropods across a chronosequence of 52 arable grassland restoration sites plus five target National Nature Reserve grassland communities in southern England, primarily on calcareous soils, to evaluate restoration outcomes and associated environmental factors.
- Study context and aims:
  - Sites reflect restoration under schemes such as the South Downs ESA, South Wessex Downs ESA, Countryside Stewardship, and Higher Level agri-environment schemes.
  - Aims to quantify arthropod communities across multiple trophic groups (detritivores, herbivores, predators, pollinators) and link them to environmental variation, plant communities, and landscape context.
- Study design and variables:
  - Restoration age range: 1–30 years; habitat quality and management (cutting, grazing) vary; surrounding landscape context varies.
  - Target communities: five pristine grassland reserves for reference comparisons.
  - Environmental packages captured: sward structure, floral similarity, plant cover, and broader landscape metrics.
- Arthropod sampling and identification:
  - Methods: pollinator transects (2 × 100 m), suction sampling (Vortis), and five pitfall traps per site, conducted in 2014.
  - Taxa targeted: bees (Apoidea), ants (Formicidae), butterflies, hoverflies (Syrphidae), beetles (selected families), plant/leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha), true bugs (Heteroptera), spiders, woodlice, millipedes.
  - Sampling cadence: transects in July–August (three visits, weather permitting); suction sampling and pitfall traps in June–July (two visits for suction, four weeks of pitfall sampling).
  - Data handling: species identified to species level where possible; juveniles excluded; data aggregated into presence/absence matrices due to differing resolutions of sampling methods.
  - Diversity metrics: Chao1 richness estimates for overall arthropods and by functional groups (detritivores, herbivores, pollinators, predators); Jaccard similarity to target grassland communities.
- Functional trait data:
  - Traits for identified species derived from literature to characterize ecological roles: 
    - Grassland specialist (habitat association)
    - Low dispersal mobility
    - Body mass (dry weight, mg)
    - Trophic group (detritivore, herbivore — with monophagous/oligophagous/polyphagous distinctions, predator, pollinator)
  - Trait data enable linking species roles to restoration outcomes and habitat features.
- Plant community and habitat structure measurements:
  - Plant surveys: ten 1 × 1 m quadrats per site to quantify vascular plant species cover; conducted June–July 2014 (pre-cut).
  - Sward structure: average height measured with a drop disk method (sward height as a structural descriptor).
- Landscape and historical context:
  - Landscape metrics derived from the 2015 UK Land Cover Map (LCM 25 m resolution).
  - Proximity index: average area of species-rich grassland patches within 1000 m, adjusted for edge distance; higher values indicate more connected grassland surroundings.
  - Historical change: percentage change in species-rich grassland cover within a 2 km radius between 1930 land-use data and 2015 (to assess extinction debt effects).
- Data products and file structure:
  - Site and species data files capturing presence/absence and abundance across different sampling methods:
    - Species_x_sites.csv (presence/absence per site)
    - Species_x_sites_combined.csv (abundance summed across sampling methods)
    - Species_x_sites_pitfall.csv (pitfall trap data)
    - Species_x_sites_suction.csv (suction sampling data)
    - Species_x_sites_transect.csv (transect presence/absence)
    - Species_x_sites_plants.csv (plant cover per site)
  - Trait and environment files:
    - Species_x_trait.csv (species traits and higher taxonomic groupings)
    - Site_x_environment.csv (site-level environmental and landscape variables, including coordinates, age, area, sward structure, proximity metrics, historic management, and diversity indices)
  - Derived metrics:
    - All.chao1, det.chao1, herb.chao1, pred.chao1, Poll.chao1 (Chao1 richness estimates by group)
    - J.plant, Jaccards_invert, and related plant-arthropod community similarity measures
- Applicability for monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation:
  - Provides a multi-taxon, trait-informed dataset linking restoration age, management, plant community structure, and landscape context to arthropod community composition and diversity.
  - Supports assessment of agri-environment scheme effectiveness and restoration monitoring by tracking biodiversity responses and functional roles over time.
  - The dataset emphasizes contemporaneous data governance considerations (metadata, openness, and clear data provenance) and the need to publicize underlying data while balancing privacy and data quality.
- Key challenges and limitations:
  - Broad taxonomic scope requires multiple sampling approaches; no single method captures all groups comprehensively.
  - Some taxa (bees and hoverflies) were identified by transect observations at a generic level, with juveniles excluded, which may affect fine-scale resolution.
  - Differences in data resolution across methods necessitated binary presence/absence presentation for certain analyses.
  - Access to comprehensive metadata and data sharing can be a barrier in practical governance, underscoring the importance of robust data management for monitoring frameworks.
