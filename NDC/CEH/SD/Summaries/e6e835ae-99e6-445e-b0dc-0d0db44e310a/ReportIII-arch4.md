# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide context for detailed studies across multiple groups; baseline data survey from 1998 described in Report II.
- 1999–2001 period covered with monitoring across automatic weather data, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition.
- 2001 management impacted by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change of site officer; core site activities (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued per the 2001 Site Management Plan.

## What was measured and how
- Measurements and dates summarized to align with cross-project comparisons:
  - Automatic Weather Station data (headline measures).
  - Above-ground biomass (biomass harvested at five summer cuts per year; plots sub-divided for detailed sampling).
  - Soil pH (upper 5 cm, measured in 1998 baseline and October 2001).
  - Botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001; cross-year comparability with 2000 data).
- Data handling and analysis:
  - Normalization of biomass to a reference plot (C1) to compare across years and accounting for methodological changes (e.g., shift from manual cutting to mechanical cutting in 2001).
  - ANOVA (split-plot) and PCA used to assess treatment effects and species composition shifts.
  - Data collection schedules and site activity tracked (Tables 1–3); extensive appendix with species codes and figures.

## Key results by variable

### Weather (2001)
- 2001 rainfall near long-term average (839–845 mm range depending on table); total radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than previous year.

### Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy: nitrogen and/or lime additions enhanced biomass relative to controls; most biomass in plots with both nitrogen and lime.
- 2001 biomass substantially higher than 1999–2000, likely due to staff changes and switch to mechanical shears.
- Biomass analysis shows significant treatment effects; interaction between treatment and year; no significant block effects.

### Soil pH
- Liming raised soil pH significantly; by Oct 2001, limed plots averaged pH ~6.19, and N&L plots ~6.38.
- Nitrogen application alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed no significant pH change since 1998 baseline.

### Botanical composition
- 2001 Point Quadrat surveys yielded 58% more hits than 2000, indicating increasing sward density, possibly from kept grazing stock removal in 1998.
- Species-level changes by treatment:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001 (most abundant across 2000); Festuca spp. increased across all treatments.
  - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) showed more Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
- Diversity: unimproved treatments showed 24 species; improved plots (N and/or Lime) had 18 species, suggesting potential decline in diversity with fertility/liming.
- PCA indicates clear separation between improved vs unimproved plots; biomass correlates positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; higher biomass associates with reduced relative presence of certain grasses and bryophytes.
- Nitrogen and/or lime treatments correlated with increased litter, reflecting faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site heterogeneity
- Spatial heterogeneity observed:
  - Columns E and F (slope right side) more acidic; underlying heterogeneity across the site affects pH readings in N and/or Lime plots.
  - Biomass variation: higher biomass generally central on site; outlying plots show lower biomass across most treatments.
- Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences among blocks.

## Data management and methodological notes
- Data management and analysis coordinated via MLURI and the Soil Biodiversity Programme; weather data downloaded regularly and transmitted to the data manager.
- Data capture schedule (Table 1) and site activity (Table 2) documented; substantial measurement effort across multiple years and sub-plots.
- Method changes acknowledged and addressed by normalizing biomass to C1; consistent Point Analysis protocols maintained across July 2000 and 2001 for comparability.
- Acknowledgements credit personnel changes and site staff support; FMD-related access restrictions were managed under an agreed protocol.

## Implications for data strategy and governance (Data Leaders perspective)
- Importance of explicit data provenance and metadata:
  - Document changes in measurement methods (manual vs mechanical cutting) and their impact on data comparability.
  - Maintain calibration notes and normalization methods (e.g., biomass normalization to C1) for cross-year analyses.
- Managing site heterogeneity:
  - Capture spatial variability (column-level pH, biomass distribution) to inform robust statistical models and interpretation.
  - Include spatial indicators (plot columns, blocks) in data schemas to account for heterogeneity in analyses.
- Data quality and consistency:
  - Ensure consistent survey protocols (Point Quadrat) across years with inter-surveyor comparisons and quality checks.
  - Keep detailed records of site access restrictions and management plan adherence to contextualize data gaps or delays.
- Data governance and accessibility:
  - Centralize data collection, storage, and metadata (weather, biomass, soil pH, botanicals) in a unified data management system.
  - Use standard analysis tools (Genstat, PCA, ANOVA) and provide reproducible scripts or workflows to facilitate cross-project integration.
- Lessons for data strategy:
  - Anticipate and document potential confounders (staff changes, equipment changes, external events like FMD) and their effects on data trends.
  - Integrate qualitative management events with quantitative data to provide a fuller interpretation framework for data leaders and stakeholders.
