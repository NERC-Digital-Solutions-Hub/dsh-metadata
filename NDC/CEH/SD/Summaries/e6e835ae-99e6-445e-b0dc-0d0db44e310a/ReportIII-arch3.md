# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Purpose and Context
- Large field experiment at Sourhope as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for linking with detailed studies, enabling year-to-year comparisons and data interoperability.
- Monitoring includes automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition; measurement dates and methods detailed for cross-year comparisons.

## Management and Site Context
- 2001 management disruptions due to Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May 2001) and a change of site Officer in Charge.
- Despite disruptions, key activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued per 2001 Site Management Plan.
- A shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001 likely influenced biomass estimates.

## Monitoring Measures and Methods
- Measures monitored:
  - Automatic Weather Station data (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground biomass across treatments (Control 1 and 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide) with five mowing events per year; data normalized to C1 for cross-year comparison.
  - Soil pH in the upper 5 cm, assessing lime and nitrogen effects.
  - Botanical composition via July 2001 Point Quadrat surveys (species abundance; 24 species in unimproved vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots).
- Analyses and protocols:
  - ANOVA (split-plot) on biomass with log transformations; PCA applied to botanical data.
  - Inter-surveyor consistency checked (no significant differences between surveyors in 2001).
  - Data collection included multiple sub-plots and blocks across plots to explore treatment effects and heterogeneity.
- Data management and integrity:
  - Weather data routed to a Data Manager; protocols for sampling and metadata were used to ensure comparability across years, with explicit notes on changes in personnel and measurement approach.

## Key Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline measures generally unremarkable: rainfall near the long-term average after a very wet year; radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than in previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Clear hierarchy among treatments maintained across the sampling period; peak biomass in July/August each year.
- 2001 saw a substantial increase in biomass estimates relative to 1999–2000, likely due to personnel changes and the switch to mechanical cutting.
- After normalizing to C1, nitrogen and lime showed the strongest positive effects on biomass.
- ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; interaction between treatment and year; no significant block differences.
- Biomass increases correlated with the relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; other species (e.g., Agrostis capillaris) declined with increasing biomass.
- Improved plots exhibited greater litter and faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition raised surface soil pH to about 6.19 (limed plots) and 6.38 (N&L plots); nitrogen alone also increased pH, though to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed little change since baseline (1998).

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- 2001 point-quadrat results showed a notable rise in total hits (58% higher than 2000), implying changes in density rather than species identity alone.
- Species shifts aligned with fertility: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis more frequent in fertilized plots; Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments.
- Diversity reduced in the most fertilized/improved plots (24 species in unimproved vs 18 in N&L), suggesting possible early signs of diversity loss with fertility enhancement.
- PCA separated improved plots (N and/or Lime) from unimproved ones; key species associations consistent with enhanced productivity and flowering/felow turnover.
- Biomass is positively correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; inversely correlated with Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and litter-associated taxa as biomass increases.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in Surface Soil pH and Plant Community
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F historically more acidic; in 2001, N and/or Lime plots in these columns showed comparatively lower pH, indicating underlying spatial pattern affecting treatment responses.

### 3.2 Variation in Vegetation Biomass
- Biomass values varied across plots with central plots tending to have higher biomass; some outliers with very low biomass identified across treatments.
- Positive correlation observed between surface soil pH and biomass, though no significant differences between blocks.

## Conclusions for Monitoring Frameworks (Implications)
- Fertility management (nitrogen and lime) significantly boosts above-ground biomass and shifts plant communities toward more productive grasses, with associated changes in species composition and increased litter turnover.
- Soil chemistry (pH) responds predictably to liming; combined N+L treatments yield the strongest pH increases.
- Site heterogeneity and spatial context strongly influence responses; central plots and certain columns show higher biomass, while some columns exhibit persistent acidity affecting outcomes.
- Data integrity considerations for monitoring:
  - Year-to-year comparability can be confounded by management changes and staff transitions; standardizing methods and documenting protocol deviations are essential.
  - Large changes in measurement conditions (e.g., mowing method) can affect biomass estimates and should be accounted for in analyses.
  - Metadata, consistent measurement intervals, and transparent reporting of access restrictions (e.g., FMD) are critical for robust monitoring and policy-relevant interpretation.
