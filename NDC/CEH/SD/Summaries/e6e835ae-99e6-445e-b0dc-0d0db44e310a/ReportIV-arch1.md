# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme Summary

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders) focusing on above-ground productivity, plant diversity, and species composition in relation to management treatments.
- Core site management since 1999: regular mowing to ~6 cm, protection from grazing, and five prescribed treatments applied to plots (Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide; plus Control plots). Insecticide applied as Dursban 4 OPA after mowing.
- Research design: Rigg Foot site with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots, randomized treatments, and a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system for data collection.

Introduction and aims
- Objective: understand links between soil biodiversity, above-ground plant communities, and ecosystem processes.
- Baseline plant community: Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland (NVC U4d) prior to treatment.
- Anticipated effects: fertilisation increases productivity in fertilised plots; unfertilised plots may lose nutrients via cuttings; potential shifts in functional plant traits and diversity.

Methods (incorporating site activity)
- Treatments
  - Control 1, Control 2 (no treatments)
  - Nitrogen (NH4NO3), Lime (CaCO3), Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA)
- Data collection (since 1999)
  - On-site Automatic Weather Station for climate data
  - Above-ground biomass: 0.5 m2 samples per sub-plot before each mow; dried and weighed
  - Baseline and repeat botanical surveys using 0.5 m2 points and 100-hole grid (point analysis)
  - Bryophyte and vascular plant identification; soil pH and moisture measurements
  - Additional small-scale surveys and biomass sampling across years
- Activity notes
  - Phase I projects largely complete by 2002; Phase II fieldwork with label pulses (e.g., 13CO2) conducted; site visits affected by foot-and-mouth restrictions in 2001.

Key results

3.1 Automatic weather station
- 2002: lower rainfall in April and September; wetter February, July, and late-year months; winter 2001/02 milder than prior years.

3.2 Above-ground biomass estimates
- 2002: biomass productivity decreased across several treatments compared with 2001, but the long-term trend shows increasing biomass from 1999 baseline.
- Nitrogen and Lime treatments strongly boost productivity; plots with both N and Lime most productive.
- Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1 in 2002.
- Block effects along the slope: Block 5 showed a 16% decline in biomass vs 30% in Block 1 in 2002, illustrating spatial heterogeneity.
- Cumulative biomass from 1999–2002 shows the continued dominance of fertilised plots in productivity, though overall reductions occurred in 2002 relative to 2001.

3.3 Interaction of soil pH, moisture, and productivity
- Lime significantly raises soil pH toward ~7.0 in upper soil layers; nitrogen also raises pH but to a lesser extent; controls and insecticide plots remain near baseline.
- Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (higher pH associated with drier conditions in treated plots).
- Overall positive relationship between soil pH and biomass when pooling all plots; within nitrogen- or lime-only plots, this relation weakens; in plots with both nitrogen and lime, the relationship can become negative, suggesting non-linear dynamics with multiple interacting factors.

3.4 Point Analysis survey
- 2002 survey shows shifts in species encounters:
  - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) dominated by Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; these grasses represented a large share of hits in fertilised plots.
  - Unimproved plots (Control and Insecticide) retained higher relative hits of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increased across the site, especially in unimproved plots (19.92% bryophyte hits in 2002 vs 10.82% in 2001; up from 6.48% in 2000).
- Insect herbivory and diversity:
  - Shannon Diversity Index increased over time in many treatments but declined in the nitrogen & lime (N&L) plots by 2002 (about 15% drop since baseline).
- Functional group shifts (CSR framework)
  - Stress-tolerators (S) expanded in unimproved plots (and modestly in N-only and Lime-only plots).
  - Competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and SR/CSR groups increased notably in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating shifts toward more productive, faster-growing species under improved soil conditions.
  - SR/CSR groups declined in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
- Statistical highlights (2000–2002)
  - Significant treatment effects on point analysis composition and diversity emerged after 2000, with stronger effects by 2001–2002.
  - Group-level analyses show clear treatment differences in the frequency of bryophytes and vascular plants.

Discussion (synthesis by management effect)

4.1 Mowing effect
- Major decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis (~40% since 2000) across treatments, suggesting a site-level response not solely tied to any single treatment.
- Festuca rubra expands notably in fertilised plots.
- Stress-tolerant species increase broadly; disturbance reduction (due to fencing and mowing) likely facilitates moss expansion, particularly under regular mowing with sward height ~6 cm.
- Bryophyte proliferation is linked to sward structure and reduced grazing; mollifying disturbance may underlie observed patterns.

4.2 Fertilisation effect
- Sustained productivity boost since 1999 with nitrogen and/or lime; the most productive plots are those with both N and Lime.
- Soil pH near 7 in limed plots; potential moisture stress may accompany high pH and high productivity, possibly causing chlorosis in some cases.
- Combined N+L fosters C-S-R (competitive) expansions, while high pH and reduced moisture shift communities toward more stress-tolerant and competitive-stress combinations.
- Nutrient-rich conditions appear to favor species capable of rapid growth; the role of lime (pH elevation) is particularly influential for plant functional dynamics.

4.3 Insecticide effect
- Insect herbivory appears to interact with plant diversity, but causal links are uncertain due to complex plant-insect interactions and treatment specifics.
- Some evidence suggests that reduced herbivory may benefit certain palatable species, contributing to local increases in diversity under some conditions, though results are not uniform across years or plots.
- Caution is advised in attributing diversity changes directly to insecticide alone.

4.4 Trampling effect
- First-year sampling in C2 plots (2002) coincided with intensive activities (including labelled 13CO2 pulses), likely suppressing vegetation growth and contributing to observed productivity declines in those plots.

Overall conclusions
- Fertilisation (N and Lime) consistently increases above-ground productivity, with the strongest response when both are applied; however, high pH and moisture dynamics may introduce stress in some plots.
- Mowing and grazing exclusion shift community composition toward stress-tolerant and moss-dominated communities, reduce the relative abundance of some common grass species, and promote mosses.
- Insecticide application may influence diversity via herbivore-mediated interactions, but more evidence is needed to establish causality.
- Plant functional-group composition (CSR framework) shifts toward competitive-stress-ruderal types under fertilised conditions, while unimproved plots tend toward stress-tolerant species; trampling in certain plots can transiently suppress productivity.
- The study underscores the complexity of linking above-ground plant responses to soil biodiversity treatments and highlights the importance of considering multiple interacting factors (nutrients, pH, moisture, disturbance, and herbivory) when predicting ecosystem responses.
