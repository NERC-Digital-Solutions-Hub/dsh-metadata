# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Documents the Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Programme at Sourhope, focusing on long-term, multi-disciplinary data collection at a field site.
- Aims to establish baseline soil-plant-microbe data and support participation in national/international networks (ECN, Micronet).
- Data streams include climate context, geology/soils, land use, vegetation surveys, soil chemistry and profile analyses, and experimental treatments across a structured field design.

## Data architecture and provenance
- Site structure: Block-based field layout with main plots and subplots, enabling multiple projects to run concurrently and support whole-site analyses.
- Horizons and terminology: Soil profiles described with standard horizon labels (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) across blocks; horizon descriptions include color, texture, structure, roots, and boundary types.
- Identification and archiving: Samples labeled with MLURI barcodes; main/archived samples stored at CEH Merlewood for long-term preservation; data linked to block, plot, and subplot metadata.
- Networks and affiliations: Data collected within the Environmental Change Network (ECN) and SERAD Micronet frameworks; outputs referenced to project reports and external resources (Twinspan/Association analyses).

## Data types and measurements
- Soil profile data (Blocks 4 and 5): 
  - Chemical: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg; moisture loss; Loss on Ignition; pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Physical/diagnostic: Soil texture descriptions, horizon depths, structure types, mottling, root presence, stone content.
  - Depths: 0–1 cm through deep horizons (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with detailed values by horizon.
- Auger samples (Block 4 and Block 5): 
  - Wt (mg) per horizon; %N, %C, C:N; Ca, Na, K, Mg; moisture loss; LOI; pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2); horizon-specific values.
  - Specific auger cores labeled (e.g., 4A–4F, 5A–5F) with per-sample chemistry.
- Vegetation surveys:
  - Method: 50 x 50 cm point quadrats within randomly selected subplots per main plot; 25 points per quadrat; presence/absence with potential abundance inference.
  - Output: Species lists per plot/subplot; indicators of community associations; edge vs interior patterns; species totals by subplot/plot.
- ECOTRON plots:
  - Soil analysis and vegetation survey data for the ECOTRON PLOT, including single-point soil metrics and per-subplot species data.
- Site details (Blocks 4 and 5):
  - Site coordinates, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material, and major soil subgroups (e.g., Brown forest soils with gleying).

## Data collection methods and structure
- Sampling design:
  - Detailed horizon-based soil profiling and auger sampling (0–30 cm) in W-patterns, with block-level soil pits to describe profile context.
  - Regular vegetation surveys using quadrats across subplots to capture spatial patterns and associations.
- Data handling:
  - Immediate analyses of soil samples with archived samples stored at -80°C for long-term preservation.
  - Data tables present mean or horizon-specific values by block/plot, with cross-block comparisons enabled by harmonized labeling.
- Data integration:
  - Data structured hierarchically: Blocks → main plots → subplots → treatments; plot-level and subplot-level treatments mapped to vegetation and soil data.
  - Horizon labeling and terminology standardized to facilitate cross-block longitudinal analyses.

## Metadata, standards, and stewardship
- Metadata richness:
  - Horizon descriptions, depths, sampling depths, lab methods, and sample IDs documented for traceability.
  - Archiving and provenance trails link MLURI barcodes to CEH Merlewood storage and to external data resources.
- Data access and reuse:
  - Outputs referenced to internal Appendices and external resources (Twinspan.doc, Association.xls) with online project outputs (e.g., project website).
  - Data intended for reuse in ecological modeling, biodiversity assessments, and long-term soil-vegetation dynamics research.
- Data governance:
  - Clear architecture and provenance enable discoverability and cross-site comparisons within larger networks.

## Data quality, limitations, and challenges
- Data gaps and incompleteness:
  - Some horizons and samples have missing fields (e.g., Na values not recorded in certain horizons; blanks in vegetation data for establishment year).
  - Block-level anomalies noted (e.g., unusual nutrient profiles) requiring cautious interpretation.
- Sampling coverage:
  - Vegetation data in establishment year covers only a subset of subplots; results are indicative rather than fully comprehensive.
- Temporal and management influences:
  - Historical grazing removal and management practices may affect vegetation dynamics and soil-vegetation relationships, complicating longitudinal interpretation.

## Implications for Data Leaders and governance lessons
- End-to-end data lifecycle:
  - The handbook exemplifies planning, experimental design, data collection, curation, archiving, and secondary analyses in a multi-disciplinary field program.
- Cross-domain data integration:
  - Successful fusion of vegetation, soil chemistry, and soil profiling demonstrates the value of harmonized data schemas and cross-domain metadata for holistic analyses.
- Metadata quality and reusability:
  - Rich horizon-level data, plot-level treatments, and robust archiving improve discoverability and enable cross-site comparisons within interoperable networks.
- Transparency and quality assurance:
  - Documentation of data gaps and anomalies enhances trust and supports cautious interpretation in reporting.
- Networked data value:
  - Embedding site data within ECN and Micronet networks amplifies trend analysis, benchmarking, and policy-relevant insights.
