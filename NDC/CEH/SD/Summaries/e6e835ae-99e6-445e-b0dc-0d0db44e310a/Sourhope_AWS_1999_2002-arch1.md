# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

## Overview
- Established in 1999, centered on an intensive field experiment at Sourhope, the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute farm (now James Hutton Institute) in the Scottish Borders (grid NT8545019630).
- Primary aims: understand the biodiversity of soil biota and the functional roles of soil organisms in key ecological processes.
- Funded 24 research projects addressing soil structure, soil processes (carbon and nitrogen cycles), and the roles of micro-fauna and flora (Bacteria, Nematoda, Protozoa, Fungi), microarthropods (Collembola, Acari), invertebrate root feeders (Tipulid, Bidionid, Scarabaeoid larvae), meso-fauna (e.g., Enchytraeidae) and macro-fauna (e.g., Megalopoda/Mollusca/Coleoptera).

## Meteorological and Environmental Data Collected
- Regular temperature, rainfall, and other weather data collected Feb 1999–Sep 2002 from an on-site Automatic Weather Station (AWS) on the experimental plots.
- Data downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Dataset: CHA_Sourhope_AWS_1999_2002.csv containing hourly summaries from 5-second samplings with fields including:
  - EXPERIMENT_ID, AWS_DATE, AWS_TIME
  - RAINFALL (mm), WIND_SPEED (ms^-1), WIND_DIRECTION (degrees)
  - AIR_TEMP (°C)
  - SOIL_TEMP_2CM, SOIL_TEMP_MINUS_2CM, SOIL_TEMP_MINUS_5CM, SOIL_TEMP_MINUS_10CM, SOIL_TEMP_MINUS_30CM (soil temperatures at various depths, in °C)
  - SOIL_MOISTURE (m^3 m^-3)

## Data Format and Metadata
- Data stored as a comma-separated values (CSV) file with clearly described column definitions and units.
- The on-site AWS provides high-resolution temporal data on air and soil conditions relevant to soil biota analyses.

## Data Quality Assurance and Limitations
- Quality control steps include numeric range checks, data formatting checks, and logical integrity checks to ensure data quality.
- The NERC program does not guarantee data accuracy or fitness for a user’s particular purpose.
- No liability is accepted for loss, damage, or other occurrences arising from use of these data.

## Contextual Weather Notes (2002)
- 2002 year featured: low rainfall in April and September, with wetter periods in February, July, and the last three months of the year, resulting in higher overall annual rainfall compared with some prior records.
- Winter 2001/02 was unusually mild, with an average Dec–Feb air temperature of 3.88°C compared with 2.28°C and 2.86°C in 2000/01 and 1999/2000, respectively.

## Access, Usage, and Documentation
- Data are managed by CEH and documented with metadata, enabling potential discovery and reuse.
- While datasets are structured and documented, users should apply appropriate quality checks and consider the stated limitations and non-liability clause when interpreting results.
