# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Location and purpose: Intensive field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme to provide a context for linking broader data sets and enable cross-year comparisons.
- Monitoring framework: Broad, standardized monitoring prescribed at the outset, with measurements aligned to a baseline (1998) and designed to facilitate inter-group data comparisons.
- Data and management: Data from established sources; verification, QA, cleaning, and transformation prior to analysis; datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.
- Key events in 2001: Government restrictions during Foot and Mouth Disease (Feb–May) limited site visits; management shift (Officer in Charge changed in May 2001) but core site activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass sampling, vegetation cutting, Point Analysis) largely continued per the 2001 Site Management Plan, with one biocide application missed.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline data: rainfall near long-term average (839 mm in 2001; 2000 was wetter). 
- Radiation: ~3473 MJ m-2; average temperatures slightly lower than prior years; soil moisture content modestly higher than earlier years.
- Overall: 2001 conditions generally unremarkable after a very wet prior year.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Treatment hierarchy maintained across years; peak biomass consistently in July–August.
- 2001 biomass higher than previous years, attributed to staff changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Normalisation: biomass data re-based to C1 in each year to compare treatment effects.
- Statistical findings: ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass shows significant differences between improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime added) vs unimproved plots, significant year-by-treatment interaction, but no significant block effects.
- Key treatment effect: nitrogen and/or lime most strongly promoted biomass, with combined nitrogen plus lime showing the strongest enhancement.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Liming effect: upper 5 cm soil pH increased to ~6.19 in limed plots and ~6.38 in nitrogen-and-lime plots by Oct 2001.
- Nitrogen alone: raised soil pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots: no significant change since the 1998 baseline.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- Method consistency: July 2001 Point Analysis survey conducted with good inter-surveyor consistency; no significant difference between surveyors.
- Density changes: total hits in 2001 58% higher than 2000, suggesting denser sward, possibly due to reduced grazing since 1998.
- Species shifts by treatment (2001 vs 2000):
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments (only remaining most abundant in Control 1 and Limed plots).
  - Festuca spp. (ovina and rubra) increased in all treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen ( Festuca ovina) and Nitrogen + Lime ( Festuca rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots favored species associated with enhanced pasture quality (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and dominance of perennial grasses; unfertilized/unimproved plots retained species typical of less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
- Diversity: unimproved plots contained 24 species, while the Nitrogen & Lime plots contained 18, suggesting potential diversity loss with higher fertility.
- Multivariate pattern: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) shows clear separation between nitrogen and/or lime plots and control/biocide plots; unimproved plots tend toward a more uniform, bryophyte- and Nardus-dominated assemblage.
- Biomass association: higher biomass correlates with increased frequencies of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while abundances of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis decline as biomass rises.
- Litter turnover: greater litter presence in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity detected: columns E and F (right-hand slope) show comparatively more acidic plots, especially among nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots.
- Underlying spatial pattern: despite sampling design, there is evidence of inherent site-wide heterogeneity affecting pH measures and community composition.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Biomass distribution: several outlier plots with low biomass across treatments; higher biomass generally found in central plots (e.g., certain Nitrogen and Lime plots, Biocide plots, Control plots).
- pH-biomass relationship: strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences in biomass between blocks.

## Data Handling and Acknowledgements
- Data collection schedule: detailed measurement dates and methods (e.g., mowing regimes, 0.5 m2 quadrats, Point Analysis framework) with multiple subplots per plot and cross-referencing projects.
- Weather data handling: Automatic Weather Station continually downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
- Data integrity: cross-check for inter-surveyor consistency; no significant bias detected between surveyors.
- Acknowledgements: appreciation extended to field staff, Sarah Buckland, MLURI Sourhope farm team, and project collaborators.

## Key Takeaways for Environmental Monitoring and Analysis
- Standardized long-term monitoring enables robust detection of treatment effects on biomass production, soil chemistry (pH), and plant community composition across years.
- Fertility management (nitrogen and lime) reliably enhances above-ground productivity and shifts vegetation composition toward species typical of improved pastures, while potentially reducing certain biodiversity metrics (e.g., species count in highly fertilized plots).
- Soil pH improvements from liming correlate with increased biomass and altered species assemblages; site heterogeneity must be accounted for in analyses and interpretation.
- Data quality checks (e.g., inter-surveyor comparisons) and clear data management practices are essential for cross-year comparisons and integration with broader environmental monitoring programs.
