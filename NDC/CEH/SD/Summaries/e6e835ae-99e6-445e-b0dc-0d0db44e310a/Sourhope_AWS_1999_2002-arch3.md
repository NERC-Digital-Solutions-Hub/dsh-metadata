# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

## Background
- Initiated in 1999 and centered on an intensive field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) to study soil biodiversity and the functional roles of soil organisms.
- 24 research projects funded to investigate soil structure, soil processes (e.g., carbon and nitrogen cycles), and the roles of micro-, meso-, and macro-fauna and flora in soil ecology.
- Weather context for 2002 noted: low rainfall in April and September, wet periods in February, July, and the last three months; overall higher than average rainfall for the year; Winter 2001/02 was unusually mild.

## Meteorological data collection
- Regular weather data (temperature, rainfall, and other metrics) collected Feb 1999–Sep 2002 from an on-site Automatic Weather Station (AWS) on the experimental plots.
- Data downloaded regularly and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Data format: hourly summaries from 5-second samplings.

## Dataset description
- File name: CHA_Sourhope_AWS_1999_2002.csv.
- Key columns:
  - EXPERIMENT_ID, Description = 'AWS' (denotes AWS data)
  - AWS_DATE (Date)
  - AWS_TIME (Time)
  - RAINFALL (mm)
  - WIND_SPEED (m/s)
  - WIND_DIRECTION (0-360 degrees)
  - AIR_TEMP (°C)
  - SOIL_TEMP_2CM (°C)
  - SOIL_TEMP_MINUS_2CM (°C)
  - SOIL_TEMP_MINUS_5CM (°C)
  - SOIL_TEMP_MINUS_10CM (°C)
  - SOIL_TEMP_MINUS_30CM (°C)
  - SOIL_MOISTURE (m3/m3)
- The data include soil temperature at multiple depths and soil moisture along with standard meteorological measurements.

## Data quality and governance
- Quality control steps included numeric range checks, formatting checks, and logical integrity checks.
- NERC does not guarantee the accuracy of data or its fitness for any particular use; no liability for losses or damages arising from use of these data.
- Data management practices emphasize quality assurance, data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and clear presentation of findings; underlying data should be shared appropriately within governance frameworks.

## Notes on data context and use
- The dataset provides a detailed, high-resolution meteorological and soil condition record aligned with the soil biodiversity studies.
- Observations of climate variability (e.g., 2002 rainfall patterns and winter 2001/02 temperatures) provide context for interpreting soil biota and process measurements within the programme.
