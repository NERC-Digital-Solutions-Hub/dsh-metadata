# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Documents soil biodiversity field data from Sourhope, focusing on Block 4, Block 5, and Ecotron plots.
- Combines detailed soil profiles, horizon-by-horizon chemistry, auger samples, and vegetation surveys.
- Supports long-term environmental and vegetation analyses, with data linked to MLURI/CEH repositories and site appendices.

## Data content by block

### Block 4
- Soil profile description (depths and horizons)
  - LF (0–1 cm): fibrous, moist, no mineral grains, smooth boundary
  - FH (1–4 cm): fibrous, moist, fine roots, smooth boundary
  - H (4–8 cm): black colour, amorphous, moist, weak blocky structure
  - Ah (8–29 cm): dark reddish brown, sandy silt loam, friable, many fine roots
  - Abg (29–40 cm): pinkish grey with mottling, coarse sandy silt loam
  - B sg (40–61 cm): brown with mottles, sandy silt loam
  - C gx (61–95 cm): reddish brown to brown, sandy clay loam, massive to platy structure
- Soil analysis by horizon (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx)
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio
  - Exchangeable bases: Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g)
  - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI)
  - pH H2O and pH CaCl2
- Auger samples (4A–4F)
  - Wt (mg) and parallel soil properties as above (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH)
- Vegetation survey (Block 4, subplots 4A–4F)
  - Presence/abundance tallies for species (e.g., Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Pe, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc)
  - Totals per subplot and per plot, with some edge vs interior patterns noted

  - Soil drainage: Imperfect; Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying
  - Rock type: undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite
- Soil profile
  - LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm),
    BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm)
  - Descriptions include colour, structure, roots, and stone content
- Soil analysis by horizon
  - Measured: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg
  - %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2
- Auger samples (5A–5F)
  - Wt (mg) and chemical properties as above (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH)
- Vegetation survey (Block 5, subplots 5A–5F)
  - Species tallies per subplot; totals by plot
  - Patterns of species presence and potential edge effects captured

## ECOTRON PLOT
- Soil analysis
  - Wt (mg): 6.089
  - %N: 0.59; %C: 8.22; C:N: 13.83
  - Ca: 2.76; Na: 0.15; K: 0.62; Mg: 1.70
  - %Moisture loss: 4.79; %LOI: 17.42
  - pH H2O: 4.79; pH CaCl2: 3.82
- Vegetation survey
  - Subplots with species tallies; overall species counts and distribution across ECOTRON subplot units

## Data structure and accessibility
- Provenance and identifiers
  - Data collected under Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Programme; MLURI/CEH repositories used for storage
  - Barcodes (MLURI) associated with each horizon/core sample and auger sample
- Data organization
  - Hierarchical by Block (4, 5) and Ecotron, with detailed horizon-level chemistry per profile and per auger
  - Vegetation data captured per subplot within each plot
- Appendices and related materials
  - Appendix entries provide block-level data, profiles, and detailed soil/vegetation datasets
  - Associated documents and Twinspan/NVC analyses referenced for community interpretation

## Data quality and limitations
- Baseline sampling constraints
  - Early surveys sampled roughly one-third of subplots per main plot; results are indicative rather than exhaustive
- Spatial heterogeneity
- Occurrence of anomalous values in some blocks/horizons requiring careful interpretation during aggregation

## Applications and data products
- Potential products
  - Soil health dashboards by horizon and block (pH, %N, %C, C:N, LOI, moisture loss, exchangeable cations)
  - Vegetation dashboards showing dominant species by plot, block, and subplot; indicator species mapping
  - NVC alignment visuals and Twinspan-derived community groupings across blocks
- Data integration opportunities
  - Linking vegetation inventories with soil profiles and treatment metadata
  - Long-term data stewardship considerations (rich metadata, consistent coding, archival storage)

## Appendices and supplemental materials
- Detailed block-level data blocks (Block 4 and Block 5) including soil profiles, horizon descriptions, chemical analyses, auger data, and vegetation tallies
- ECOTRON plot data and site context
- Data documentation and analysis outputs (e.g., Twinspan/NVC mappings) referenced for deeper exploration
