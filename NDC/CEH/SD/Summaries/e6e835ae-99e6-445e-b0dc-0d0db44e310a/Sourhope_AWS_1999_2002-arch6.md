# Background

- The NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (established 1999) focused on intensive study of a large field experiment at the Sourhope farm (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, now James Hutton Institute) to monitor changes in aboveground biomass production, species composition, and diversity.
- Aims included understanding soil biota diversity and the functional roles of soil organisms in key ecological processes; 24 projects funded to study soil structure, soil processes (carbon and nitrogen cycles), and the roles of micro-, meso-, and macro-fauna in soil ecosystems.

- Meteorological data collection
  - Regular temperature, rainfall, and other weather data were collected from an on-site Automatic Weather Station (AWS) from February 1999 to September 2002.
  - Data were downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
  - Data are hourly summaries derived from 5-second samplings.
