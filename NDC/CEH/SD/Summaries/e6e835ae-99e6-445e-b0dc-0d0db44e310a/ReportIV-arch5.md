# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Report

- Four years since the start of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders).
- Primary aims: understand soil biodiversity and its functional roles, and monitor above-ground plant productivity, composition, and diversity in relation to management practices.
- Site and scope: Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope with five replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; multiple plots per block allocated to sixteen Phase I projects and eight Phase II projects.

## Study Design and Treatments

- Layout: 5 blocks; each block has 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells used for data collection and cross-group use.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide (formerly Biocide).
- Management actions:
  - Site-wide mowing: monthly May–September to ~6 cm.
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) applied after mowing on Insecticide plots.
  - Spring fertilization with Nitrogen and/or Lime on designated plots.
- Data collection cadence and scope: started in 1998–1999 with ongoing data collection through 2002, including a baseline vegetation survey in 1998.

## Data Collected and Methods

- Weather and climate:
  - On-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999; records precipitation, radiation, air and soil temperatures.
- Above-ground productivity:
  - Sampling from randomly chosen 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots S, T, U, V; clipping dried and weighed to estimate biomass.
- Botanical surveys:
  - Baseline (July 1998) and annual point analysis surveys (July/August 2000, 2001, 2002) using a 0.5 m2 cell with a 100-hole grid and 25-pin drop to record species at soil surface.
  - Bryophyte identification to species level in 2002; appendix lists full bryophyte and vascular plant species.
- Soil measurements:
  - pH (approx. 5 cm depth) measured regularly since 1998; 2002 measurements in plot centers and in cells used for point analysis.
  - Soil moisture content measured in 2002 with theta probe in point-analysis cells.
- Additional small-scale surveys and biomass sampling by various projects; total site soil sampling by 2002 reached 11,621 samples.
- Data management and project activity:
  - Phase I fieldwork largely completed by 2002; Phase II activities in 2002 involved advanced fieldwork including labelled CO2 pulses and trace gas measurements.

## Key Findings and Trends (2002 Focus)

- Biomass productivity:
  - Clear long-term increase across treatments since 1999, with nitrogen and/or lime plots showing the strongest productivity.
  - 2002 biomass generally lower than 2001 for many treatments; greatest productivity remains in plots with both nitrogen and lime.
  - A slope-related pattern: Block 1 (lower) showed larger declines in biomass than Block 5 (higher), indicating spatial effects on productivity.
- Fertilization and pH:
  - Lime markedly increased soil pH to near 7.0 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen had a smaller positive effect on pH.
  - Positive relationship between soil pH and biomass overall, but treatment-specific nuances: positive correlation in most plots, but a weaker or negative trend when both nitrogen and lime were applied.
  - Higher pH and reduced soil moisture in fertilized plots may have contributed to stress during dry periods.
- Plant community composition and diversity:
  - Dominant grasses continue to be Agrostis spp. with a noted shift away from Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis in 2002, possibly due to mowing and disturbance regimes.
  - Festuca rubra expanded notably in fertilized plots; Festuca ovina decreased; Poa pratensis increased in fertilized plots.
  - Bryophytes (mosses) expanded across the site, increasing their share of hits, especially in unimproved plots; rhytidiadelphus squarrosus became more common but decreased in N&L plots.
  - Point-analysis diversity (Shannon index) showed increases in many treatments since 1998, but a 15% overall decline in the N&L plots by 2002 relative to baseline.
- Functional groups (CSR framework, Grime):
  - Stress-tolerant (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderal (SR/CSR) groups accounted for most plant hits (69–95% range per plot).
  - By 2002, treatment differences emerged:
    - N&L plots: CSR and SR/CSR groups expanded, indicating a shift toward more growth-promoting, high-nutrient-tecnhologies.
    - Unimproved plots: S species benefited most, reflecting stress tolerance under lower fertility and higher disturbance regime (absence of grazing, regular mowing).
  - The insecticide treatment appeared to influence the balance of functional groups indirectly via changes in herbivory and plant community structure, though direct causal links require further evidence.
- Insecticide and trampling effects:
  - Insecticide effects on diversity were observed in trends consistent with some literature, but a direct causal link remains cautious.
  - C2 plots (introduced in 2002) experienced notable trampling effects during 13CO2 pulse activities, contributing to reduced productivity in 2002.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Implications

- Multi-project data environment:
  - Data generated across 16 Phase I projects and 8 Phase II projects; diverse data types and formats require harmonized metadata and data dictionaries.
  - Treatments and plot-level metadata are extensive (block, plot, treatment, sub-plot, cell coordinates) and must be consistently documented for cross-project analyses.
- Documentation and metadata needs:
  - Clear, machine-readable metadata describing treatments, application dates, rates, mowing regime, and data collection protocols.
  - Ontology alignment for plant functional types (e.g., CSR categories) to enable standardized cross-year analyses.
- Data quality and gaps:
  - 2002 weather data gaps due to a station outage; some dates replaced with data from Konza, requiring clear data provenance notes.
  - Missing data in certain years/plots noted in appendices; appropriate flags and imputation notes should accompany datasets.
- Data sharing and discoverability:
  - The Soil Biodiversity programme maintains project-level data and species lists; ensure datasets and metadata are accessible via the programme’s website and appropriate data repositories.
  - Documentation of data lineage (which project collected which data, processing steps for biomass, point analysis, and diversity indices) is essential for reuse and reproducibility.
- Data volumes and archiving:
  - Large dataset with over 11,000 soil samples and extensive above-ground biomass and biodiversity records; robust data archival and versioning practices are necessary.

## Practical Takeaways for Data Stewards

- Ensure a consistent, richly documented data model across all plots, treatments, and years (blocks, plots, sub-plots, cells, species, functional groups, bryophytes).
- Maintain comprehensive metadata for all data types (biomass, point analysis, bryophyte identifications, soil pH, moisture, weather).
- Use standardized vocabularies and functional-type classifications (CSR framework) to enable cross-year comparisons.
- Record and flag data gaps, outages, and substitutions (e.g., weather data in 2002) with clear provenance notes.
- Facilitate data sharing by providing accessible data portals, downloadable datasets, and accompanying data dictionaries and appendices (species lists, treatment summaries).
- Plan for future data integration by aligning with the programme’s ongoing outputs (e.g., Soil Biodiversity website) and ensuring compatibility with external meta-analysis needs.
