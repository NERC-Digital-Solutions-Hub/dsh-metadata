# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, within the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Focused on monitoring a broad set of variables to contextualise more detailed studies: automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical (vegetation) composition.
- Experimental design involved multiple treatments (Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide) across sub-plots, with data collection across 1999–2001.
- Data presentation follows Report II style to aid cross-year comparisons and linkages with other datasets.

## Data and Methods
- Site management affected by two 2001 events:
  - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited site access from February to May 2001.
  - Change of the site Officer in Charge in May 2001.
- Measurements and schedule:
  - Automatic Weather Station: hourly/headline measures of key weather variables (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground biomass: five 0.5 m2 harvests per plot each summer (1999–2001); biomass sums over the season and is later analyzed (ln-transformed) for statistical tests.
  - Soil pH: upper 5 cm soil sampled and pH measured (baseline 1998; follow-up 2001).
  - Botanical composition: July 2001 Point Quadrat surveys (100 cells per frame; about 50% coverage per surveyor); species hits recorded and later analyzed via PCA and relative abundance.
- Data quality notes:
  - Inter-surveyor consistency tested in 2001 with no significant difference between two surveyors.
  - A shift from manual mowing to mechanical cutting in 2001 likely contributed to increased biomass estimates.
  - Mowing timing and protocols were documented; most management activities except one biocide application proceeded in 2001.

## Key Findings

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 rainfall near long-term average (notably after a very wet previous year).
- Total annual radiation largely unchanged; average temperatures slightly lower than in prior years.
- Average soil moisture content modestly higher in 2001 versus earlier years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass production persisted across the sampling period; peak biomass typically in July/August.
- 2001 biomass higher than previous years, likely due to a combination of staff changes and the switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Normalising by C1 within each year revealed:
  - Nitrogen and Lime (and their combination) markedly promote biomass compared with unimproved plots.
  - ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. unimproved plots, plus a significant inter-year interaction; no significant block effects.
- Implications: nitrogen and lime inputs boost productivity; biomass measurements in 2001 were influenced by changes in harvesting method.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime application continued to raise soil pH, reaching an average around 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots by Oct 2001.
- Nitrogen alone also increased soil pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (Aug 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 survey quality: no significant surveyor-based differences; the total number of species hits in 2001 rose by about 58% relative to 2000, suggesting greater sward density (potentially from earlier grazing stock removal in 1998).
- Treatment effects on species composition:
  - Agrostis capillaris most abundant across 2000 but declined across 2001 in all treatments; remained dominant only in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. (ovina and rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen-only and Nitrogen+Lime plots.
  - Improved plots (especially those with Nitrogen and/or Lime) showed higher abundances of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, with Poa pratensis frequently co-occurring with Festuca rubra.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more apparent in fertilised plots; those associated with less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
  - 24 species observed in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime, suggesting potential early declines in diversity with strong fertility enhancement.
- Multivariate analyses:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Unimproved plots tended to cluster with bryophytes and less fertile-associated species; improved plots showed more frequent presence of Festuca rubra and related species.
  - Correlations showed that higher above-ground biomass was associated with increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while greater litter and bryophyte presence tracked lower biomass plots.
- Additional observations:
  - The frequency of litter increased in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity across the site observed; columns E and F appeared more acidic and/or had more C1/Biocide-dominated plots, suggesting an underlying spatial pattern in soil acidity and vegetation response.
- This heterogeneity is possibly exaggerated by treatment distributions (more unimproved plots in those columns).

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Biomass values show outliers with some plots having notably low biomass across treatments, while central plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen+Lime 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, reinforcing the link between soil fertility and productivity.
- No significant difference in biomass between blocks (statistical test indicates non-significance).

## Implications for Data Use and Products
- Longitudinal, plot-level data enabling cross-year comparisons and treatment effect analyses (e.g., biomass, soil pH, and vegetation composition).
- Normalization against a reference plot (C1) provides a consistent means to compare year-to-year treatment effects despite changes in mowing methods.
- Species-level data (point quadrat hits) coupled with biomass metrics supports analyses of community dynamics in response to fertility and liming.
- PCA and biomass–species abundance relationships offer foundations for building predictive models of how fertility regimes shift sward structure.
- Site heterogeneity highlights the importance of spatial structure in data analyses and the need to account for column/plot location in models.

## Limitations and Notes
- 2001 field operations changes (staff, mowing method) likely influenced biomass measurements; interpretation should account for this methodological shift.
- FMD-related access restrictions temporarily reduced on-site activities, but management plans allowed resumption under veterinary protocols.
- Diversity trends observed (fewer species in more fertilised plots) may reflect early-stage changes; longer monitoring would clarify persistence.
