# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive field study at Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders.
  - Baseline context described in the Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998); aims to monitor a broad context for linking with detailed studies.
  - 2001 site management affected by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions (Feb–May 2001) and a change of Officer in Charge in May 2001.
  - Management activities on site continued with a defined 2001 Site Management Plan; one biocide application was missed in May 2001 but other applications completed.

- Results

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather generally unremarkable.
    - Rainfall near long-term average; total around 839 mm (vs 845 mm in 1999 and 1209 mm in 2000).
    - Radiation similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly cooler; soil moisture higher than in prior year.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak biomass in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to changes in personnel and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Biomass analyses normalised against C1 to compare treatment effects; nitrogen and lime (especially N+L) most effective at boosting biomass.
    - ANOVA results (log-transformed biomass): significant differences between improved (N and/or L added) vs non-improved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant differences between blocks.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime continues to raise soil pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots ~6.19; Nitrogen & Lime plots ~6.38.
    - Nitrogen alone also increases pH, but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots show no significant change since baseline (August 1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Analysis survey replicated with no significant surveyor bias; total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000, indicating greater sward density (likely from removal of grazing stock in 1998).
    - Treatment differences in dominant species observed:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; remained most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
      - Festuca species (F. ovina, F. rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in fertilised plots (notably F. rubra in N&L plots and F. ovina in N plots).
      - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
    - Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential early declines in diversity with higher fertility.
    - Multivariate analysis (PCA) indicates clear separation of improved plots (N and/or L) from unimproved (Control and Biocide); higher frequency of Festuca rubra in limed plots observed.
    - Relative abundance shifts: positive association of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis with higher biomass; decline of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with increasing biomass.
    - Increased litter observed in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, suggesting faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

- Site Heterogeneity

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity across the site noted; columns E and F (right-hand slope) tended to be more acidic, partly due to plot composition (more Controls or Biocide plots there).

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Outlying plots with low biomass across treatments identified (e.g., several Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Biocide plots).
    - Higher biomass generally found in centrally located plots (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant differences in biomass between blocks (block effects not significant).

- Additional notes
  - The 2001 survey and related analyses (Tables, Figures) emphasize how N and/or Lime treatments shift community composition toward more productive grasses and grasses associated with improved pastures, while reducing diversity in highly fertilised plots.
  - The relationship between soil chemistry (pH) and biomass is reinforced, with liming and nitrogen both elevating pH and biomass, albeit to different extents.
