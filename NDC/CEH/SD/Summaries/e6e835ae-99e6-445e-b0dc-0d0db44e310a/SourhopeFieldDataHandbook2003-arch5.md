# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview of the documented material in this section
- Presents soil profiles, soil chemical analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys for BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 at the Sourhope site, including ECOTRON plot data.
- Includes site details, horizon descriptions, laboratory measurements, and per-plot and per-horizon data tables, with associated archival identifiers and sampling metadata.

## BLOCK 4: SOIL PROFILE AND ANALYSES
- Soil profile description (depths and horizons)
  - LF: 0–1 cm
  - FH: 1–4 cm
  - H: 4–8 cm
  - Ah: 8–29 cm
  - Abg: 29–40 cm
  - B sg: 40–61 cm
  - C gx: 61–95 cm
  - Descriptions emphasize fibrous roots, moist conditions, mineral absence in upper horizons, and progressively more structured horizons with varying colour and texture.
- Soil analysis (per horizon)
  - Horizons listed: FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx/C gx (BLOCK 4); includes wt (mg), %N, %C, C:N, Ca (meq/100 g), Na (meq/100 g), K (meq/100 g), Mg (meq/100 g), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Notable patterns: relatively low pH (~4.0–5.0) across horizons, high LOI in surface horizons, and varying Ca/Mg/K across horizons with common igneous stone content.
  - MLURI barcodes linked to horizon samples (e.g., FH 603951, H 603952, Ah 603953, AB 603954, Bs 603955, Cx 603956).

  - Data indicate notable differences among sub-samples, with relatively consistent carbon content and variability in exchangeable cations.
- Vegetation survey (BLOCK 4)
  - Plot 4A and 4B–4F records show species presence/absence counts by subplot, with totals indicating community composition per plot.
  - Data include presence of indicator species and overall species totals per plot, illustrating vegetation structure within the block.

- BLOCK 5: VEGETATION SURVEY
  - Subplots within plots (e.g., 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F) show per-subplot species counts and totals
  - Summaries indicate composition by plot and subplot, highlighting community structure and potential indicator species across the block

- ECOTRON PLOT: VEGETATION SURVEY
  - Subplots A, B, C, D, E, F with species counts per subplot and overall totals
  - Data provide baseline plant community composition for long-term ecotron monitoring and cross-site comparisons

## Metadata, Archiving, and Data Governance
- Archival identifiers
  - Horizon-level samples in BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 carry MLURI barcodes (e.g., 603951–603963 for BLOCK 4 horizons; 603957–603963 for BLOCK 5 horizons; 603930 for ECOTRON soil analysis)
  - Auger samples and analyses linked to dedicated analysis codes (e.g., ANALYSIS OF AUGER SAMPLES.5A–5F)
- Data structure and units
  - Horizons are labeled with standard codes (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and depth ranges
  - Chemical values typically presented as wt, %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca/Na/K/Mg in meq/100 g, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), and pH(CaCl2)
- Data completeness and caveats
  - Some plots/horizons have missing or incomplete data; variability exists within horizons and blocks due to natural heterogeneity and sampling coverage
  - Partial vegetation sampling in some plots; some horizons show limited or no root data
- Governance implications for data stewards
  - Ensure consistent horizon coding and per-plot identifiers; maintain master dictionaries for abbreviations and species codes
  - Standardize units across blocks and document sampling methods, dates, and laboratory procedures
  - Preserve archived soil samples and metadata with traceable identifiers; provide access through a central repository and link to related files (e.g., Twinspan/Association datasets)
  - Annotate data gaps and anomalies clearly, and implement versioning to support longitudinal analyses and cross-site comparisons

## Key takeaways for data stewardship
- The Sourhope dataset provides a multi-horizon, multi-plot record of soil chemistry and vegetation across BLOCK 4, BLOCK 5, and ECOTRON plots, suitable for long-term ecological and comparative analyses.
- Rigorous metadata, stable data schemas, and comprehensive archiving are essential to enable discovery, reuse, and cross-site synthesis, especially given incomplete sampling and horizon-specific variability.
- Clear documentation of horizons, sampling dates, lab methods, and provenance is critical to maximize data reuse and integration with ECN Micronet and related datasets.
