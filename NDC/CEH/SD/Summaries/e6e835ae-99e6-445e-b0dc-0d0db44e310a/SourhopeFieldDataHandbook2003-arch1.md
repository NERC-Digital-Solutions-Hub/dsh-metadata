# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- The Sourhope field site integrates long-term environmental monitoring with plot-level experiments to study soil–plant interactions in upland grasslands.
- Data presented cover detailed soil profiles, horizon descriptions, and associated vegetation surveys for blocks 4 and 5, plus ECOTRON plots, with explicit analytical measurements (N, C, LOI, pH, cations, moisture loss, etc.) across horizons and auger samples.
- Appendix-style data organization supports cross-block comparisons and future meta-analyses.

## Data structure and collection methods
- For each block and horizon, measurements include:
  - Weight of samples (mg), %N, %C, C:N ratio
  - Exchangeable cations (Ca, Na, K, Mg in meq/100g)
  - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition
  - pH in water and in CaCl2
  - Horizon designations (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with depth ranges
- Auger sampling provides discrete 0–30 cm profiles per plot, with soil cores bulked to form a plot sample; samples archived for long-term storage.
- Vegetation surveys accompany soil analyses, documenting plot-level species presence/absence and totals.

## BLOCK 4: SOIL PROFILE AND ANALYSIS
- Profile sequence (depths in cm): LF 0–1; FH 1–4; H 4–8; Ah 8–29; Abg 29–40; B sg 40–61; C gx 61–95.
- Key horizon characteristics:
  - LF and FH: mostly fibrous organic-rich at surface, moist.
  - Ah: dark reddish-brown, sandy silt loam, friable with abundant fine roots; presence of igneous stones.
  - Abg to Cx: transition to brown to reddish-brown colors with varying stone content; structured to platy/blocky horizons; increasing solidity with depth.
- Selected soil-chemistry highlights (BLOCK 4):
  - pH(H2O) ranges approximately from 4.76 to 5.02 across horizons; pH CaCl2 generally around 3.9–4.1 in augmented measurements.
  - %N ranges from about 0.02 to 2.14 across horizons; %C from ~6 to 38% (highest in FH, decreasing with depth).
  - C:N ratios span roughly 12–20, decreasing with deeper horizons.
  - Ca varies by horizon, from about 0.34 to 10.05 meq/100g; Mg from ~0.26 to 4.48 meq/100g; K around 0.07–3.41 meq/100g; Na generally low.
  - %Moisture loss and %LOI show high organic content in upper horizons (LOI as high as ~73% in FH) and progressively lower values with depth; moisture loss follows a similar downward trend.
- BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES:
  - %N ~0.56–0.58% (shallow horizons) to ~0.57–0.58% in some deeper horizons.
  - %C ~7.0–8.0% in upper horizons, down to ~0.12–0.27% in deepest horizons.
  - C:N ratios ~12.6–14.3 across samples.
  - Ca, Mg, K, Na values show horizon-dependent variation; pH(H2O) ~4.5–4.9; pH CaCl2 ~3.5–4.1.
  - %LOI values range from ~4–18% across auger samples, with notable LOI hotspots in organic-rich horizons.
- Observations for BLOCK 4:
  - Acidic surface horizons with high organic content and substantial horizon-to-horizon variability.
  - Block-to-block anomalies in certain indicators, with depth-related increases in pH and variable exchangeable cation patterns.
  - Data suitable for multivariate analyses linking soil chemistry, organic content, moisture, and pH with horizon position and block differences.

## BLOCK 5: SITE DETAILS, PROFILE, AND ANALYSES
- SITE DETAILS (BLOCK 5):
  - Grid NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; soil drainage: Imperfect; major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
- BLOCK 5 SOIL PROFILE (0–100 cm):
  - LF 0–1; FH 1–5; H 5–7; Ah 7–25; AB 25–35; Bg 35–49; BCg 49–70; Cg 70–100.
  - Horizon features reflect a progressive illuviation and mottling, with abundant igneous stones and a well-developed BCg horizon in which clay translocation and mottling are evident.

- BLOCK 5 AUGER SAMPLES:
  - Range of measurements across horizons shows similar patterns to Block 4 but with block-specific values (e.g., Ca 0.35–5.08; Mg 0.58–3.50; %Moisture loss 2.79–9.43; %LOI 4.12–17.96; pH H2O ~4.45–4.95; pH CaCl2 ~3.53–4.14).
  - Cumulative data indicate cumulative accumulation of organic matter in upper horizons with variable nutrient concentrations down the profile.
- BLOCK 5 VEGETATION SURVEY:
  - Subplots across plots 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F show varying totals of species across plots, reflecting heterogeneity in plant communities linked to soil depth and horizon chemistry.
  - Dominant grasses and upland indicators appear across plots, with patterns suggesting slope- and horizon-dependent vegetation assemblages.
- ECOTRON PLOT DATA (RIGG FOOT):
  - Soils: Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76; Mg 1.7; moisture loss 4.79; LOI 17.42; pH H2O 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82.
  - Vegetation survey indicates a comparable community composition to field plots, enabling networked comparisons with ECN/Micronet data.
- Data availability and use:
  - Appendices provide block-level soil and vegetation data, horizon descriptions, and full tables for cross-block comparisons.
  - The data support multivariate analyses (PCA, regression) to relate soil chemical properties, organic matter, moisture, pH, and horizon depth with vegetation structure and management treatments.

## Key takeaways for data analysts
- The Sourhope site offers a rich, multi-layered dataset linking soil chemistry, organic matter, moisture dynamics, and pH across clearly defined horizons and blocks, with explicit vegetation context.
- Block 4 and Block 5 data show consistent depth-dependent patterns: acidic surface horizons with high organic content transitioning to more mineral horizons, with horizon-specific nutrient and cation dynamics.
- Data are organized for robust cross-block analyses and integration with ECOTRON/Micronet networks, enabling exploration of how lime, nitrogen, grazing-like perturbations, and extended monitoring influence soil properties and plant communities.
- The combination of profile descriptions, auger samples, and associated vegetation surveys provides a strong foundation for correlations, predictive modeling, and interpretation of soil–vegetation interactions in upland grasslands.
