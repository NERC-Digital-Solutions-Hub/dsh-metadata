# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary (2002)

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope field site (Macaulay Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders).
- Focused on above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and diversity in response to experimental treatments.
- Treatments include mowing (site-wide), nitrogen and/or lime fertilisation, and insecticide application (Dursban 4).
- Data and monitoring spanning weather, biomass harvests, point quadrat analyses, soil pH and moisture, and various small-scale botanical surveys; total site data since 1998, with 11,621 soil samples collected by 2002.
- Site management and activity limited by external events (e.g., 2001 foot-and-mouth restrictions; 2002 weather station outage affecting a portion of data).

## Methods and Data

- Study design: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks; each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; random treatment allocation.
- Management tasks (since 1999): monthly mowing to ~6 cm; insecticide application after mowing on insecticide plots; nitrogen and/or lime applied in spring to designated plots.
- Data collection:
  - Automatic Weather Station for regular climate data.
  - Above-ground biomass: random 0.5 m2 cell in sub-plots; samples oven-dried and weighed; data collected since 1999.
  - Baseline and annual botanical surveys: 0.5 m2 point quadrats with 25-point baseline (1998) and yearly 100-point frames (2000–2002) to record species at grid intersections.
  - Soil sampling: pH measurements since 1998; soil moisture (theta probe in 2002) and other soil properties.
  - Additional small-scale botanical surveys and biomass sampling, with detailed appendices (treatment maps, species lists, and data per plot).
- Analytical approaches: split-plot ANOVA, PCA, correlation analyses, and examination of functional plant groups (CSR framework).

## Key Findings by Management Theme

- Mowing effect
  - Dominant shift: Festuca spp. increases, Agrostis spp. declines (Agrostis more mowing-intolerant).
  - Stress-tolerant species expand in unfertilised plots; bryophytes expand under regular mowing with a ~6 cm sward height.
  - Overall diversity effects mixed; mosses increase across the site, more pronounced in less fertilised plots.

- Fertilisation effect
  - Productivity: sustained increases in biomass with nitrogen and/or lime; the strongest gains when both N and lime are applied.
  - Soil chemistry: lime raises mean soil pH toward ~7.0; nitrogen has smaller pH impact; high lime rates can be associated with reduced soil moisture and plant stress (chlorosis in some areas).
  - Functional groups: a shift from stress-tolerators (S) toward more competitive (C) species in fertilised plots; C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups become dominant in N+L treatments; unimproved plots retain more stress-tolerant flora.
  - Biodiversity: Shannon diversity index shows declines in 2002 for nitrogen+lime plots relative to other treatments, while other treatments show stability or increases.

- Insecticide effect
  - Diversity: Shannon index highest in insecticide plots, suggesting possible links to reduced herbivory and greater provision for a broader set of species.
  - Mechanisms: potential release of palatable species from herbivore pressure; however, definitive causal links require cautious interpretation due to indirect effects.

- Trampling effect
  - C2 plots (expanded trampling during 13CO2 pulses) showed notable reductions in productivity, indicating trampling as a negative biomass driver in those plots.

## Comparative and Pattern-based Insights

- 2002 biomass: overall biomass across most treatments fell relative to 2001, though long-term trend since 1999 shows rising biomass relative to the starting point.
- Fertilisation and slope effects: higher productivity often observed in lower slope positions; block-level (slope) effects indicate spatial heterogeneity in productivity responses.
- Interactions among pH, moisture, and productivity: lime-induced pH increases strongly; higher pH correlates with higher productivity overall, but single-factor effects vary by treatment; moisture and pH show a negative relationship, influencing plant responses under certain treatments.
- Point Analysis and functional groups: PCA separates improved (fertilised, lime-treated) from unimproved plots; bryophyte abundance increases in unimproved plots; Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis become characteristic of fertilised plots; Agrostis spp. decline with mowing and other factors.
- Functional-group dynamics (CSR framework): through 2000–2002, shifts toward C- and SR-related strategies in improved plots; stress-tolerant groups predominate in unimproved plots.

## Data Quality, Access, and Monitoring Implications

- Data richness: long-running, standardised data streams across biomass, botanical surveys, soil chemistry, and microhabitat parameters; extensive appendices detailing site activities, species lists, and treatment maps.
- Monitoring value: the study provides a robust, long-term dataset to evaluate how management actions influence ecosystem function (productivity) and structure (diversity and functional traits) in grassland–bryophyte systems.
- Accessibility: data and methodological details are documented in extensive appendices; dataset potentially shareable through the Soil Biodiversity Programme portal and CEH contacts.
- Missing data note: 2002 weather data gaps due to a station outage; sub-periods were supplemented with data from nearby stations.

## Opportunities and Challenges for Environmental Data Use

- Challenges
  - Increasing the value of datasets by coupling with other relevant data streams (e.g., broader land-use, climate models) to enable cross-site and cross-study analyses.
  - Facilitating access to underlying data to enable independent verification, re-analysis, and broader policy-relevant insights.

- Opportunities for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Use standardized, multi-year datasets to assess policy performance and ecosystem health trajectories.
  - Integrate above-ground vegetation data with soil chemistry, moisture, and microhabitat information to model functional responses to management.
  - Leverage the CSR-based functional classification and PCA results to compare functional shifts across treatments and with other grassland systems.
