REPORT III
RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Context and scope
- Large-field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Purpose: provide a broad context for detailed studies, enable cross-year comparisons, and document monitoring methodology, management, and outcomes.
- Baseline data and monitoring procedures described to support linking with user datasets and comparisons across years.

## Data collected and measurement methods
- Automatic Weather Station: headline measures collected on site (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture) and dataset transmitted to CEH Data Manager.
- Above-ground biomass: regular summer harvests across plots (May–Sep) with mowing and clipping methods; biomass sums across five cuts per year; normalization against a reference plot (C1) for year-to-year comparability.
- Soil pH: measurements at upper 5 cm; soil pH tracked over time, with liming and nitrogen treatments affecting acidity.
- Botanical composition: Point Analysis surveys (July 2001) with 5 cm grid cells and 0.5 m2 sampling within subplots; species hits recorded; supplementary detailed species list and abundance data.
- Experimental design and timelines: plots in a Nutrient and Lime (N&L), Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Biocide (B), and Control variants; two control plots (Control 1 and Control 2); measurements conducted across 1998–2001 with annual summaries; Field activity schedules and data collection counts documented.
- Data quality and personnel notes: 2001 saw a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears, contributing to increased biomass measurements; an Officer in Charge change occurred; FMD restrictions limited site access in early 2001 but management plan largely followed.

## Key results by measurement type

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture content modestly higher than prior years.
- Weather data context supports interpretation of biomass and phenology shifts across treatments.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments, with peak production in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass higher than in 1999–2000, likely due to personnel changes and a switch to mechanical cutting.
- When normalized to C1, nitrogen and/or lime additions show the strongest positive effects on biomass.
- ANOVA supports significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots and a significant Year × Treatment interaction; no significant block effects detected.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime additions continued to raise surface pH (0–5 cm): about 6.19 in limed plots, 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots by Oct 2001.
- Nitrogen alone also increased pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots remained near baseline pH since Aug 1998.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 point quadrat survey: 2001 sampling yielded 58% more hits than 2000, suggesting increased sward density (potentially from reduced grazing since 1998).
- Treatment differences in frequently encountered species emerged:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001, remaining dominant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments; more prevalent in N and Biocide (F. ovina) and N&L (F. rubra) plots.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were most apparent in fertilized plots (especially N and L combinations).
  - Species linked to less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) were more common in unimproved plots.
- Diversity: unimproved plots supported 24 species; N&L plots had 18 species, suggesting potential local declines in diversity with intensified management.
- Multivariate analysis (PCA) indicates clear separation of improved vs unimproved plots; biomass correlates positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while certain bryophytes and grasses decline as biomass increases.
- Increased litter in N and/or lime plots indicates faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
- Spatial heterogeneity exists across the site, with columns E and F tending to be more acidic (linked to higher proportion of control/biocide plots in those areas).
- Biomass distribution shows higher values in centrally located plots; some outliers with low biomass align with edge/collinearity effects.
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, while block effects are not statistically significant.

## Operational context and governance considerations
- Management disruptions in 2001 due to Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions affected site access (visitor ban Feb–May 2001) but were incorporated via a protocol-based resumption of sampling.
- A change of site management (Officer in Charge) occurred in May 2001.
- Data provenance notes: weather data centrally collected and distributed; main data streams include biomass, soil pH, and botanical surveys, with supplementary annual activity and measurement schedules (Tables 1–6 and Appendix 1 referenced in the report).

## Data governance and stewardship implications
- Data continuity and comparability: documented change from manual to mechanical cutting in 2001 requires explicit annotation to preserve cross-year comparability; normalization to a reference plot (C1) is essential for biomass time-series analyses.
- Metadata and provenance: dataset should include treatment identifiers, plot/subplot structure (blocks, S/T/U/V subplots), measurement dates, and any methodological deviations (e.g., FMD-related access limitations, personnel changes).
- Spatial context: site heterogeneity and column-level pH variability highlight the need to store geospatial cues or plot coordinates (columns, block, and orientation) to support spatial analyses and bias assessment.
- Data quality indicators: language in the report suggests ANOVA and PCA were used to assess treatment effects and species composition; ensure statistical metadata, transformation steps (e.g., ln-transform of biomass), and significance thresholds are captured in datasets.
- Accessibility and archival: routine transfer of weather data to CEH Data Manager; ensure all primary datasets (biomass, soil pH, botanical hits, weather) are archived with clear versioning, data sources, and links to published figures/tig tables for traceability.

## Summary for use
- The Sourhope 1999–2001 dataset provides multi-faceted measurements (biomass, pH, plant species composition, weather) across a factorial treatment design (Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime, Biocide) with two controls and replicated blocks.
- 2001 saw notable increases in biomass linked to method changes and continued fertilizer/pH manipulation; soil pH rose with liming, affecting plant community dynamics and litter turnover.
- Spatial heterogeneity within the site influences biomass and species patterns; data users should incorporate site position and pH context when modeling treatment effects.
- For data stewards, clear documentation of methodological changes, normalization approaches, and spatial metadata will maximize cross-year comparability and long-term reusability of these data.
