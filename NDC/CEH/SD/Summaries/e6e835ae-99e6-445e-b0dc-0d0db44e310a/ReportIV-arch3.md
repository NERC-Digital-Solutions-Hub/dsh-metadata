# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site — Summary of 2002 Findings

## Introduction and Aims
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) focusing on above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity, and their links to soil processes.
- Site management removed grazing in 1998; implemented five summer mowing cuts to 6 cm; experimental treatments include nitrogen and/or lime fertilisation and insecticide application.
- Primary aim: understand how management actions affect plant communities (functional groups and diversity) and productivity to inform monitoring and decision-making.

## Study Design and Treatments
- Experimental setup: 5 replicate blocks on downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; data are allocated to different research groups using a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system.
- Treatments at plot level:
  - Control 1: no treatment
  - Control 2: no treatment
  - Nitrogen
  - Lime
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA; referred to as Biocide in earlier years)
- Management practices: monthly mowing (May–Sept) to ~6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime as per schedule.
- Data collection and monitoring:
  - On-site Automatic Weather Station for climate data (rainfall, radiation, temperature)
  - Above-ground biomass: monthly clipping within 0.5 m2 cells, dried and weighed
  - Baseline vegetation assessment in 1998; annual point analysis surveys (0.5 m2 cells with 100-hole grid; 25 points touched per sampling cell)
  - Soil pH (0–5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe in July/August 2002)
  - Additional small-scale surveys and biomass sampling in select plots
  - Data management and analysis: ANOVA (split-plot), PCA, correlation analyses; long-term comparisons (1999–2002)

## Key Findings

### Biomass Productivity and Climate Context
- Biomass production followed a clear treatment hierarchy: highest in plots with both nitrogen and lime; lower in unfertilised controls; 2002 biomass generally fell relative to 2001 across several treatments.
- Fertilised plots (especially N&L) maintained stronger productivity trends; Control 2 plots consistently less productive.
- 2002 featured lower rainfall in April and September, with wetter periods in February, July, and late year; temperatures were relatively mild in winter 2001/02.

### Soil Chemistry and Productivity Relationships
- Lime increased soil pH sharply (to near 7 in upper soil layers) with nitrogen also raising pH modestly; controls and insecticide plots remained close to their 1998 baselines.
- Strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH observed (r ≈ -0.68); improved plots tended to be drier.
- Overall, higher soil pH correlated with greater above-ground biomass across treatments; however, within the nitrogen-and-lime (N&L) plots, the positive relationship weakened and may become negative, suggesting moisture limitation/other constraints at high pH under certain conditions.
- The greatest biomass response occurred in N&L plots, indicating synergistic benefits of combined nutrient and pH modification on productivity.

### Plant Community Dynamics and Diversity
- Treatment-driven shifts in species composition:
  - Improved (fertilised) plots showed higher relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, with these grasses accounting for a larger share of hits in point analyses.
  - Unimproved plots (Control and Insecticide) retained higher relative abundance of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Mowing effects (site-level disturbance) linked to:
  - Decline of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis by 40% since 2000, across all treatments, suggesting a site-level response to mowing rather than specific treatments.
  - Expansion of Festuca rubra in fertile plots; bryophyte expansion (mosses) across the site, likely aided by consistent sward height around 6 cm and reduced grazing.
- Bryophytes:
  - Bryophyte hits increased from 6.5–10.8% (2000–2001) to 19.9% (2002) of total hits, particularly in unimproved plots.
  - Bryophyte diversity and biomass rose overall, with some reductions in bryophyte hits in N&L plots.
- Functional group ecology (CSR framework):
  - Dominant functional groups across surveys: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderal (SR/CSR).
  - By 2002, N&L plots showed a shift toward C-S-R dominance, reflecting greater growth capacity under improved soils; unimproved plots favored S-dominance (stress-tolerators).
  - SR/C-S-R groups generally reduced in lime-improved and insecticide-treated plots, consistent with changing disturbance and fertility regimes.
- Litter and diversity metrics:
  - Shannon Diversity Indices remained without baseline differences but diverged over time; 2002 indices showed significant treatment effects, with N&L plots showing a notable 15% decline relative to baseline, while several other treatments exhibited increases (notably insecticide-treated plots).

### Insecticide and Trampling Considerations
- Insecticide (Dursban) effects on diversity are complex and not conclusively causal from this study; observed patterns align with theoretical expectations that removal of herbivory can favor certain palatable species, but broader, direct linkages require cautious interpretation.
- Trampling effect: In 2002, C2 plots experienced a sharp productivity decline, likely due to trampling during heavy activity linked to 13CO2 pulse experiments, highlighting a confounding management factor when interpreting treatment effects.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- Long-term, multi-factor monitoring is essential to disentangle treatment effects from site-level disturbance, grazing history, and weather variability.
- Functional-group analysis (CSR framework) provides insight into ecosystem responses to fertility, pH shifts, and disturbance, offering a more nuanced signal than species richness alone.
- Data richness (biomass, species hits, bryophyte dynamics, litter, soil chemistry, moisture) supports more robust causal inference but also demands careful data governance, metadata completeness, and transparent data sharing.
- Site-level management interactions (mowing regime, trampling during research activities) can substantially influence outcomes and should be explicitly modeled or controlled in monitoring designs.
- Data quality and continuity: weather station reliability (noted 2002 data gaps) underscores the need for robust instrumentation, data validation, and contingency data sources to maintain longitudinal integrity.

## Data and Monitoring Considerations (Governance and Quality)

- The project generates extensive multi-year datasets (biomass, point analysis hits, species lists, bryophyte records, soil chemistry, moisture, weather data) and appendices document detailed measurements.
- Common monitoring challenges highlighted by the Programme context:
  - Data gaps and access to high-quality metadata
  - Siloed data across research groups; need for integrated governance and shared standards
  - Public sharing of underlying data vs. data ownership and openness
  - Data transformation and normalization requirements for cross-plot comparisons
  - Communication of complex, multi-dimensional findings to stakeholders
  - Establishing and maintaining data governance to keep datasets up to date and usable

## Summary of Endpoints and Takeaways for Monitoring Practice
- Fertilisation (N and/or lime) reliably raises productivity, with combined N+L delivering the strongest biomass response, while potentially increasing soil pH toward neutral-to-alkaline levels that may interact with moisture stress.
- Regular mowing without grazing appears to favor stress-tolerant and bryophyte-rich communities, while reducing the relative abundance of some competitive grasses in unfertilised/fertilised mixes.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are not definitively causal in this study but warrant careful consideration of herbivory dynamics and associated plant responses in monitoring frameworks.
- Bryophyte expansion and shifts in dominant grasses (Festuca/Agrostis) are important indicators of disturbance, fertility, and moisture regimes; these should be tracked as part of routine biodiversity monitoring.
- Trampling and other operational factors can confound treatment effects and should be documented and accounted for in data interpretation.
