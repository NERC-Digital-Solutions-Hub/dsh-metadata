# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview of the Presented Data (Blocks 4 and 5; Ecotron plot)

- The document provides detailed soil profiles, chemical analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys for Blocks 4 and 5 at Rigg Foot, Sourhope, plus an Ecotron plot, as part of long-term monitoring in Sourhope.
- Data are organized around horizon-level descriptions, laboratory measurements (nutrients, carbon, moisture, pH, etc.), and plot-level vegetation inventories, enabling cross-horizon and cross-plot comparisons.
- The information is designed to support site- and block-scale interpretation of soil–vegetation interactions and to inform monitoring and data governance for environmental health indicators.

## BLOCK 4: SOIL PROFILE, ANALYSES AND VEGETATION

- Soil profile and horizons
  - Profile begins at LF (0–1 cm) progressing through FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), to C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Horizon descriptions emphasize fibrous to semi-fibrous textures, abundant fine roots, and mineral stone content in deeper horizons; color/texture changes indicate organic-rich surface and progressively more mineral subhorizons.
  - Boundary types include sharp smooth and sharp wavy boundaries between horizons.

- Soil chemistry and physical properties (Block 4, detailed values)
  - %N ranges across horizons from ~0.42 to 2.14; %C ranges from ~6 to 38; C:N ratios from ~12 to ~20, reflecting increasing carbon in upper horizons and lower in deeper horizons.
  - Cation chemistry (meq/100 g): Ca dominates in several horizons (e.g., FH 10.05; H 7.08; Ah 0.92; AB 0.36; Bs 0.59; Cx 0.34); Mg and K present in smaller amounts (Mg ~3.35–4.48 across some horizons; K ~0.12–3.41 depending on horizon).
  - pH values: pH(H2O) generally around 4.7–5.0; pH(CaCl2) around 3.6–4.2, indicating acidic to strongly acidic conditions.
  - Moisture and organic matter: %Moisture loss ranges 4–11% across horizons; LOI (loss on ignition) highest in surface horizons (elevated organic matter content in FH/H/A horizon zones, with notably high LOI in some horizons, e.g., 63–73% in specific sites).
  - Auger samples (4A–4F) show elevated %C (roughly 7–8%), moderate %N (~0.5–0.6%), C:N ~12–14, and Ca/Mg/K levels indicating soils with limited nutrient status but with appreciable base cations, especially Ca.

- Vegetation survey (Block 4, PLOTS 4A–4F)
  - Subplots (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Pe, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc) show widespread species presence with totals per plot indicating diverse plant communities.
  - Dominant signals include a mix of grasses and forbs; patterns suggest four main associations with some edge plots exhibiting distinct assemblages (e.g., presence of D. flexuosa and Molinea caerulea in some blocks).

- Data governance and storage (Block 4)
  - Data and samples are managed within MLURI; some data are publicly shared to support openness, while metadata gaps can constrain reuse.
  - Horizon descriptions and standardized sampling support cross-block comparability and longitudinal interpretation.

## BLOCK 5: SOIL PROFILE, ANALYSES AND VEGETATION

- Soil profile and horizons
  - Profile sequence: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Horizon characteristics emphasize fibrous to semi-fibrous surface materials, laminated color changes (reddish brown, grey mottling in AB/Bg horizons), and abundant igneous stones (andesite) in deeper horizons.
  - Soil structure ranges from angular blocky to subangular blocky; clear smooth boundaries between several horizons.

- Soil chemistry and physical properties (Block 5, detailed values)
  - %N values range ~0.65–2.17 across horizons; %C ranges ~9–34% in surface horizons, decreasing with depth; C:N ratios generally ~10–17.
  - Base cations: Ca ranges roughly 0.35–11.91 meq/100 g across horizons, Na often very low or undetectable in deeper horizons, K typically ~0.58–3.3 meq/100 g, Mg ~0.58–5.92 meq/100 g, indicating nutrient-rich to moderately enriched substrates depending on horizon.
  - Moisture loss and LOI: %Moisture loss and %LOI are higher in surface horizons (e.g., Ah and AB horizons) with LOI values significantly contributing to organic matter interpretation.
  - pH (H2O): Generally acidic to moderately acidic in surface horizons (approx. 4.4–5.2); pH CaCl2 values around 3.5–4.0, reflecting acidity with depth.
  - Auger samples (5A–5F): display similar ranges for %N (~0.53–0.62), %C (~7.0–9.0%), C:N ~11–14, Ca ~1.0–5.1 meq/100 g, Mg ~1.5–3.5 meq/100 g, K ~0.58–0.83 meq/100 g, moisture loss ~4.5–5.2%, LOI ~14–17%.

- Vegetation survey (Block 5, PLOTS 5A–5F)
  - Subplots show detailed counts per Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, etc., with Totals per plot indicating species richness and community structure.
  - The data illustrate multiple subplots and species totals per plot, reflecting diverse upland grassland communities across Block 5.

- Data governance and storage (Block 5)
  - As with Block 4, data are collected and stored within the Sourhope data framework; the dataset includes horizon-level descriptions, plot-level vegetation inventories, and auger analyses to support long-term monitoring and cross-site synthesis.

## Data Use and Monitoring Framework Relevance

- The Block 4, Block 5, and Ecotron data illustrate a comprehensive approach to environmental health monitoring at the field scale:
  - Horizon-based soil profiling paired with chemical and physical analyses enables tracking of soil health indicators over time.
  - Multi-block designs and detailed horizon descriptions facilitate cross-site comparability and understanding of spatial variability.
  - Integration of vegetation surveys with soil data supports interpretation of biotic responses to edaphic conditions and donor-level drivers.
- Practical challenges highlighted for monitoring framework authors:
  - Data gaps and variable metadata quality can hinder data reuse and cross-site synthesis.
  - Data access and governance issues can impede timely sharing of underlying datasets.
  - Silos within and between organisations can limit integration; standardized data schemas and consistent governance are needed to improve interoperability.
- Appendices and data accessibility:
  - The dataset includes extensive horizon descriptions, plot-level soil and vegetation data, and ECOTRON measurements, supporting replication, longitudinal monitoring, and data-driven decision-making.
