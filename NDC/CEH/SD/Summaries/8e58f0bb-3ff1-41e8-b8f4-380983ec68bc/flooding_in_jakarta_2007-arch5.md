# Files

## Overview
- Three data files covering rainfall, river inflows, and flood depth for the Jakarta metropolitan area during Jan-Feb 2007.
- Data types include raw measurements, model outputs, and a georeferenced flood depth raster.

## Datasets

- Jakarta-rainfall-jan-feb2007.csv
  - Hourly rainfall (mm/hr) from 8 raingauges in Jakarta metropolitan area.
  - Locations with coordinates (e.g., Depok, Pondok, Curug, Tg.Priuk, Jakarta_BMKG, Halim, Cengkareng, Dermaga).
  - Time period: 2007-01-20 00:00 to 2007-02-08 23:00.
  - Data structure: CSV with a column per raingauge; single header line.
  - Quality: Hourly and daily totals checked for inconsistencies and spurious values.
  - Usage note: Jakarta_BMKG rainfall used to disaggregate daily rainfall at other locations.

- Jakarta-riverInflows-jan-feb-2007.csv
  - Hourly modeled river discharge (m3/s) at 7 discharge points feeding into Jakarta.
  - Locations: Cisande, Ciliwung, Kalibekasi1–5; with geographic coordinates.
  - Time period: 2007-01-20 00:00 to 2007-02-08 23:00.
  - Data structure: CSV with a column per discharge point; single header line.
  - Quality: Output from calibrated Shetran hydrological model.
  - Experimental design: City-scale model output for 30m grid resolution over the Jakarta area (model runs noted for specific catchments).
  - Calibration: Cisande (Batubela 2003, daily); Ciliwung (Katulampa, 2002–2005, 2007–2008, hourly); Kalibekasi uses same parameters as Ciliwung.

- Jakarta-Jan-Feb2007_max_water_depth.tiff
  - Georeferenced raster of maximum modeled water depth (meters) on a 30m grid.
  - Model: CityCAT hydrodynamic model for Jakarta.
  - DEM and networks: AW3D30 DEM for elevations; OpenStreetMap river network embedded in DEM; no buildings included.
  - Inflows: Rainfall and lateral inflows sourced from the other files in this dataset.
  - Calibration/validation: Model outputs compared against measured numbers of displaced people and flood-related damage.
  - Metadata: Raster grid with depth values; linked to rainfall and inflow inputs for interpretation.

## Data collection and provenance

- Rainfall data
  - Collected hourly from eight raingauges; includes geographic coordinates.
  - Calibration/QA applied to hourly and daily totals.

- River inflows
  - Generated by the Shetran hydrological model.
  - Calibrated for specific periods and catchments; hourly outputs for multiple catchments flowing into Jakarta.

- Water depth
  - Generated by CityCAT hydrodynamic model using a 30m grid.
  - Depth values validated against observed displacement and damage data.

## Data structure and formats

- CSV files
  - One column per location (rainfall or discharge point); a single header line.
- TIFF file
  - Georeferenced 30m resolution raster representing maximum water depth.

## Quality control and provenance

- Rainfall: checks for inconsistencies and spurious values at hourly and daily scales.
- River inflows: model output from a calibrated hydrological model; calibration details provided.
- Water depth: model validation against observed flood impacts; uses standardized input datasets and DEM.

## Experimental design and sampling

- Rainfall
  - Standard hourly measurements across eight gauges.
  - Daily totals derived and used to disaggregate other location rainfall via Jakarta_BMKG data.

- River inflows
  - Modeled inflows for Cisande, Ciliwung, and Kalibekasi catchments feeding Jakarta.
  - Calibration across multiple periods and catchments; hourly discharge outputs.

- Water depth
  - CityCAT model run at 30m grid resolution over Jakarta.
  - DEM and river network sourced from open data; buildings not included.
  - Rainfall and lateral inflows linked to inflow/outflow simulations.
  - Validation against displacement and damage data.

## Limitations and considerations for data stewards

- Multi-source data with different scales and formats requiring harmonization (rainfall in mm/hr, discharge in m3/s, depth in meters).
- Some model-based outputs rely on calibration from limited historical periods; results depend on model assumptions.
- Buildings are not included in the depth model, which may affect interpretations for urban flood impacts.
- Metadata should clearly document time coverage, coordinate references, data sources, and model parameters to enable reuse and discovery.

## Access, stewardship, and maintenance

- Data items are provided as discrete files (two CSVs and one TIFF) with explicit temporal and spatial scopes.
- For long-term stewardship, ensure:
  - Harmonized metadata across datasets (units, time zones, coordinate systems).
  - Documentation of model assumptions, calibration periods, and validation data.
  - Clear provenance linking rainfall, inflows, and depth outputs for end users.
