# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- The UKBMS is a collaborative, funded program by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- It relies on volunteers to collect annual data on butterfly population status via a large-scale, site-based monitoring network.
- Since 1976, monitoring has grown to over 2,500 active sites per year and provides data to understand insect population changes and biodiversity policy questions.

## Sampling framework and data collection
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, 26 counts per year from April to September; around 2,000 sites sampled annually.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km square locations with two parallel 1 km transects; 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August); ~800 squares per year.
- Targeted surveys: Single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species.
- All sampling methods are analyzed together to produce comprehensive UKBMS insights.

## Nature of data and trend analysis
- Data are used to create abundance indices (relative, not absolute) reflecting the proportion of butterflies observed at a site, which varies by species detectability.
- Indices for each species are combined using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with an adjustment: site-year data are weighted by the proportion of the species flight period observed that year for that site.
- The approach uses all counts within a season (Pollard walks, reduced surveys, WCBS) to model the seasonal pattern and extrapolate gaps, with heavier weight given to observed data.

## Quality control
- Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Built-in automatic checks flag potential errors (e.g., abnormally high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators review records; ongoing validation throughout the season.
- Further automated and manual validation checks assess distribution ranges, flight periods, first-time site records, and unusual abundances; discrepancies are discussed with coordinators/recorders and corrected in the master dataset.

## Details of this data download
- Provides long- and short-term trends in collated indices for species with sufficient data; delivered as a CSV file.
- Long-term trends span from 1976 to the latest year available; some species start later due to data limits.
