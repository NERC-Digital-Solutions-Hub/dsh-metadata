# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- What it is: A collaborative, funded program organized by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. It provides annual data on butterfly population status from a large-scale, site-based monitoring network, with over 2,500 actively recorded sites yearly.
- Purpose and impact: The UKBMS dataset supports understanding trends in butterfly populations and informs biodiversity and policy questions. Data have been collected since 1976.
- How data are structured: Data come from three sampling components that are analyzed together:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 26 counts/year, ~2000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, 2–3 visits/year, ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval counts, and other methods focused on particular species.

- Key sources and references: Pollard & Yates (1993) and Dennis et al. (2016) underpin methodologies for transects and the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) used to combine site data.

- Data outputs: Indices are abundance-based (relative measures) rather than absolute counts; site indices are combined into species-level collated indices using GAI with weighting by seasonal survey coverage. Counts across all methods are used to model seasonal patterns and fill gaps.

- Data access and use: This data download provides long- and short-term trends for all species with sufficient data, in a CSV format. It includes both historical and recent trend information and accommodates varying start years due to data sufficiency.

- Data governance and quality: Data are collected on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, and uploaded to a central database. Automated checks and regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation, with further automated and manual validation to catch out-of-range records, unusual abundances, early/late flight periods, distribution issues, and data-entry errors.

- Collaboration and support: UKBMS partners offer advisory support and opportunities for co-authorship; for collaboration or interpretation of outputs, contact is available.
