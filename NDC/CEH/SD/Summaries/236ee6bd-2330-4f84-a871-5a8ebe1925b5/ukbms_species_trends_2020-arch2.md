# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and organization
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - It relies on volunteers and aims to track butterfly population status to inform biodiversity policy and environmental health over time.

- Data collection framework
  - Sampling includes:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): 2–4 km routes, weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year), ~2000 sites.
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits/year (plus July/August focus).
    - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
  - Since 1976, the scheme covers the UK with over 2500 actively recorded sites yearly.
  - All data types are analyzed together to assess trends.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Indices are combined via the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016) with a site-year weighting that reflects the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed.
  - Seasonal patterns are estimated using all counts to extrapolate gaps, ensuring observed data dominate final indices.

- Quality control
  - Data flow: field forms → online entry (UKBMS MyData or Transect Walker) → database.
  - Automated and manual validation checks (e.g., improbable counts, species outside flight period, distribution range checks).
  - Regional transect coordinators perform ongoing review; corrections are made through queries and coordinated edits.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides long- and short-term trends for species with sufficient data, in CSV format.
  - Key outputs include:
    - Long-term trends from 1976 onward, where data permit.
    - Recent trends over 20 and 10-year windows (slopes, standard errors, P-values, trend descriptors, and percentage changes).
  - Columns include species names (common and scientific), trend metrics, and descriptive trend details.

- Licence and attribution
  - Data are provided under the Open Government Licence (OGL).
  - Must cite the dataset (including DOI) in publications and include the attribution: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.

- Offer of collaboration and contact details
  - UKBMS partners can advise on data interpretation and offer co-authorship or input for publications and presentations.
