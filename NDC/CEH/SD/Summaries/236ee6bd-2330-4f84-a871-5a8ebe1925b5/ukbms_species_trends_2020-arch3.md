# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with contributions from volunteers.
- It has monitored butterfly population changes across the UK since 1976 and currently engages over 2,500 active recording sites each year.
- Purpose: to provide annual data on butterfly population status and trends to inform policy questions related to biodiversity.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- Data are collected as abundance indices (relative measures of population size, not absolute counts) from multiple sampling methods.
- Sampling framework includes:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes, 2–4 km, 26 counts/year from April to September.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, 2–3 visits/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts, or alternative methods focusing on specific species.
- Indices are combined into species-level collated indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weighting by the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed each year and site.
- The method uses all counts in a season to estimate the annual seasonal pattern and extrapolate to account for recording gaps, giving more weight to observed data than extrapolated data.

## Quality control

- Data are collected on standard forms and entered online (UKBMS MyData) or via Transect Walker before being uploaded to a central database.
- Automatic checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods); coordinators review and may adjust data.
- Regional transect coordinators validate entries; ongoing checks throughout the season.
- Additional validation includes queries for records outside known distribution ranges, out-of-season records, first-time site records, and unusual abundances, with corrections made as needed.
