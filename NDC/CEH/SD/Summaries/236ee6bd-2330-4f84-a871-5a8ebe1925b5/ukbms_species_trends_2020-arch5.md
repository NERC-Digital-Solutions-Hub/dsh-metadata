# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview and governance
- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- It relies on volunteers and has monitored butterfly abundance across the UK since 1976, with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.
- Data support and stewardship are aimed at informing policy questions related to biodiversity status and trends.

## Data collection and sampling framework
- Three main components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) across ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with parallel 1-km transects, 2–3 visits per year across ~800 squares.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts.
- Data collection spans April–September under suitable weather; all methods are analyzed together to assess population status and trends.

## Data processing and trend analysis
- Data are expressed as abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of true abundance; some species are more detectable than others.
- Collated species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with a weighting adjustment based on the proportion of flight period surveyed at each site/year.
- All seasonal counts are used to model yearly patterns and extrapolate gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

## Quality control and validation
- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online (UKBMS data entry site) or via Transect Walker before upload to a central database.
- Automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators review data; additional automated and manual validation checks are applied, including distribution, flight period, first-time site records, extreme counts, and inter-year consistency.
- Corrections are made through data queries and edits to the UKBMS dataset as needed.

## Details of this data download
- Provides long- and short-term trends in collated indices for species with sufficient data; delivered as a CSV file.
- Long-term trends span from 1976 to the year indicated in the download name; some species have later start years due to data limitations.
- Columns include: COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS, F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDETAIL, F_FULL_R, T20_LIN_B, T20_LIN_SE, T20_LIN_P, T20_TRENDDETAIL, T20_20_R, T10_LIN_B, T10_LIN_SE, T10_LIN_P, T10_TRENDDETAIL, T10_10_R.
- Descriptions define the trend direction, statistical significance, and percentage changes over defined time windows (overall, last 20, and last 10 years).
