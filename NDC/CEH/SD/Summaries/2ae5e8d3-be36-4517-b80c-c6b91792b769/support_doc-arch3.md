# Limits to adaptation: Causes and consequences for ecology and ecosystem function . Brunner, F.S., Reynolds, A., Price, S., White, N., Sadler, D.E., Wilson, I.W., Atkinson, D.A., Paterson, S., and Plaistow, S.J. (2022)

## Overview
- A large-scale mesocosm experiment (42 mesocosms, 3000 L each) at Ness Botanical Gardens, UK, studying how genetic diversity and intrinsic plasticity in Daphnia magna interact with repeated heatwaves to affect ecosystem function.
- Seven treatments manipulated combinations of population genetic diversity, phenotypic plasticity, and heatwave exposure to reveal impacts on ecological and evolutionary outcomes.
- Data collection was comprehensive and multi-layered, spanning environmental conditions, phenotypic evolution, community composition, and genetic frequencies, to link environmental drivers with biological responses.

## Experimental design and scope
- Experiments designed to “tease apart” effects of:
  - Genetic diversity within Daphnia magna populations
  - Intrinsic plasticity (phenotypic flexibility) of clones
  - Frequency and intensity of heatwave exposure
- Layout and treatments implemented within the 42 mesocosms; heatwaves programmed to emulate a historical profile (July 2006) plus +2°C.
- Part of a broader NERC project (NE/N016017/1).

## Data collection regimes

### Data set 1 — Hourly temperature
- Temperature tracked at 5-minute intervals across all 42 mesocosms.
- Real-time data transmission to a virtual server; two summer heatwaves induced in 2017 and 2018 (except six control mesocosms with high-diversity populations).
- Data span July 2017 to September 2019.

### Data set 2 — Environmental parameters
- Biweekly to biweekly sampling of environmental attributes, including:
  - Chlorophyll, oxygen saturation, pH, conductivity
  - Dissolved nutrients (phosphates, nitrates, ammonium)
  - Light transmission and turbidity
  - Biological cover indicators (algae crust). 
  - D. magna presence/absence
  - Physical/chemical water column properties
- Treatment, block, and other contextual metadata captured (e.g., sampling week, mesocosm identity).

### Data set 3 — Phenotypic evolution
- Five timepoints for common garden experiments (Sept 2017; Mar 2018; Jun 2018; Aug 2018; Oct 2018).
- Sampling: 6 adult D. magna per mesocosm, reared under standardized laboratory conditions.
- Measured nine life-history traits (e.g., age/size at maturity, juvenile/adult growth, clutch metrics) and heat tolerance (CTmax).
- Data describe heritable life-history responses across heatwave exposure and treatment levels.

### Data set 4 — Community data
- Zooplankton community sampled at 8 timepoints.
- Depth-integrated water samples collected, filtered, preserved, and later identified/counting performed under microscopy.
- Taxonomic resolution up to the lowest feasible level; includes counts for Daphnia species and other zooplankton groups, enabling community composition analyses.

### Data set 5 — Clone frequency changes
- Genotyping of Daphnia magna from selected treatments at 8 timepoints.
- Treatments include high diversity (T1–T2 control and heatwave), mid diversity (T3), low diversity (T5), and maladapted Danish clones (T7).
- Genotyping implemented with microsatellite markers (4 loci for some treatments; 15 loci for others) using multiplex PCR and capillary electrophoresis.
- Resulting data provide clone frequencies (proportions) across time and treatments; average genotypes per mesocosm reported.

## Data quality, structure, and governance
- Quality control: All data checked and verified; processed for subsequent analysis.
- Data structure: CSV format with clearly defined columns per dataset (e.g., time, mesocosm, treatment, block, replicate, variables).
- Metadata emphasis: Datasets include extensive descriptors for treatments, blocks, sampling times, and measured variables to support reproducibility and cross-study integration.
- Data provenance: Datasets generated by the study team as part of the NERC grant; detailed methodological notes accompany each dataset (sampling methods, measurement instruments, and processing steps).

## Data availability and accessibility
- The five datasets are organized for download and include file names and sizes (e.g., temp_hourly_Jul17_Sept19.csv; ecosystems.bothyrs.csv; MA1to6data.csv; fullComm_CS0added.csv; Clone_proportions.csv).
- Data are described as available to download, with explicit documentation of variables and timeframes.
- The study provides methodological detail to enable reuse in monitoring and policy evaluation contexts, including treatment mapping and timepoints.

## Key monitoring-relevant aspects
- Multilevel measurement framework: environmental drivers (temperature, water chemistry, light), biological responses (phenotypic evolution, community composition), and genetic dynamics (clone frequencies).
- Temporal resolution spans short-term (hourly temperature) to long-term (multi-year phenotypic and genetic data) with multiple heatwave events.
- Standardized experimental controls and common-garden conditions to disentangle genetic vs. environmental effects.
- Comprehensive metadata and dataset documentation to support transparent data governance, reuse, and comparative monitoring across studies.
- Explicit data sharing and openness aligned with research governance, enabling policy-relevant monitoring analyses.
