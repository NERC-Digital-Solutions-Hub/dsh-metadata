# Limits to adaptation: Causes and consequences for ecology and ecosystem function . Brunner, F.S., Reynolds, A., Price, S., White, N., Sadler, D.E., Wilson, I.W., Atkinson, D.A., Paterson, S., and Plaistow, S.J. (2022)

## Experimental design
- Large-scale mesocosm experiment to disentangle effects of genetic diversity and intrinsic plasticity of Daphnia magna clones on ecosystems exposed to repeated heatwaves.
- 42 mesocosms of 3000 L each located at Ness Botanical Gardens, UK.
- 7 treatments manipulating genetic diversity, plasticity, and heatwave exposure.
- Heatwave regime: two summer heatwaves implemented (2017 and 2018); heatwaves mimic the 2006 profile plus 2°C; most mesocosms subjected to heatwaves, with 6 high-diversity control mesocosms as exceptions.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Datasets collected on temperature change (hourly), Daphnia phenotypic changes (every 3 months), Daphnia clone frequency changes (every 3 months), environmental parameters (every 2 weeks), and community composition (every 3 months).
- Data collected over approximately 2017–2019 as part of NERC Highlight grant NE/N016017/1.
- Five datasets available to download as CSV files:
  1) Hourly temperature data from 42 mesocosms (July 2017 – Sept 2019)
  2) Environmental parameter data (July 2017 – June 2019)
  3) Phenotypic evolution data (2-year period)
  4) Community data (2-year period)
  5) Clone frequency changes over 2 years in selected mesocosms
- Standard laboratory "common garden" conditions used for phenotypic assays to control environmental effects.

## Data sets
- Data set 1 – Hourly temperature: 5-minute interval measurements from 42 mesocosms; temperature sensors at 50 cm depth; two summer heatwaves applied to most mesocosms.
- Data set 2 – Environmental parameters: variables such as chlorophyll, oxygen saturation, pH, conductivity, nutrients (Dissolved P/N), light transmission, and presence/absence of D. magna, among others.
- Data set 3 – Phenotypic evolution: assayed life-history traits at five timepoints (Sept 2017; Mar 2018; Jun 2018; Aug 2018; Oct 2018) with six individuals per mesocosm reared in standard conditions; measured traits include age at maturity, size at maturity, juvenile and adult growth, clutch sizes, heat tolerance (CT max), and related life-history metrics.
- Data set 4 – Community data: zooplankton community composition at eight timepoints; depth-integrated water samples processed and counted for multiple taxa (e.g., Daphnia species, other microcrustaceans, and invertebrates).
- Data set 5 – Clone frequency changes: genotyping of D. magna clones at eight timepoints; high- and low-plasticity and maladapted clones; microsatellite markers used for clone identification; data include timepoint, clone identity, and mean proportions across mesocosms.
- Data collection aimed to quantify how genetic diversity, plasticity, and heatwaves influence ecological and evolutionary trajectories.

## Data structure
- Data are provided as comma-separated values (CSV) files.
- Each dataset includes fields such as Date/Time, Meso/Tank, Treatment block, replicate information, and dataset-specific variables (e.g., temperature readings, environmental metrics, life-history traits, community counts, and clone frequencies).
- Data set 1–5 collectively cover temporal resolution from hourly measurements to multi-timepoint phenotypic and genetic data.

## Quality Control
- All data have been checked, verified, and processed for analysis to ensure reliability for downstream analyses.

## Data architecture and methods (key details)
- Temperature data: 5-minute interval readings from sun-protected sensors at 50 cm depth; real-time data transmission to a virtual server.
- Environmental data: a broad suite of water quality and ecological metrics, collected biweekly.
- Phenotypic data: standardized common garden conditions to compare heritable traits across treatments and timepoints.
- Community data: systematic sampling and taxonomic identification for zooplankton composition.
- Genotyping: multiple microsatellite markers; PCR-based genotyping; high-throughput scoring to determine clone frequencies.
