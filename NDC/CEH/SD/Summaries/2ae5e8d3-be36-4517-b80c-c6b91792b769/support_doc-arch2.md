# Limits to adaptation: Causes and consequences for ecology and ecosystem function

- Overview
  - Large-scale mesocosm experiment to disentangle the effects of genetic diversity and intrinsic plasticity of Daphnia magna on ecosystems exposed to repeated heatwaves.
  - Location: 42 x 3000 L mesocosms at Ness Botanical Gardens, UK.
  - Experimental design includes seven treatments manipulating genetic diversity, phenotypic plasticity, and heatwave exposure to assess ecological consequences and limits to adaptation.
- Experimental Design
  - Treatments mapped within each mesocosm; comparisons across diversity, plasticity, and heatwave exposure.
  - Heatwaves: two summers (2017 and 2018) with profiles mimicking a historical event plus 2°C increase; applied to most mesocosms except certain high-diversity controls.
  - Data collection regime:
    - Temperature: hourly measurements across all mesocosms.
    - Daphnia phenotype: every 3 months (five timepoints across the study).
    - Clone frequencies: every 3 months.
    - Environmental parameters: every 2 weeks.
    - Community composition: every 3 months.
  - Funding/credit: NERC Highlight grant NE/N016017/1; data generated by the study team.
- Datasets Available (five data sets)
  - Data set 1 – Hourly temperature
    - 42 mesocosms, July 2017 – September 2019; 5-minute interval data; sun-protected sensors at 50 cm depth; real-time data via remote server.
    - Includes two induced summer heatwaves and control conditions.
  - Data set 2 – Environmental parameters
    - Variables include chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen (saturation and mg/L), pH, conductivity, nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, ammonium, total phosphorus/nitrogen), light transmission (water surface and below), and presence of D. magna.
    - Also records treatment, block, sampling dates, and other contextual metadata.
  - Data set 3 – Phenotypic evolution
    - Five timepoints; common-garden rearing of six adult D. magna per mesocosm; nine life-history traits (e.g., age at maturity, growth rates, clutch data, CT max).
    - Monitor changes in heritable life-history traits and heat tolerance across treatments and heatwaves.
  - Data set 4 – Community data
    - Zooplankton community composition from eight sampling sessions; counts by taxa (e.g., Daphnia spp., other crustaceans, rotifers, copepods, etc.).
    - Depth-integrated sampling with standardized processing and counting protocols.
  - Data set 5 – Clone frequency changes
    - Genotyping of D. magna clones at multiple timepoints (six high-plasticity, six low-plasticity, and maladapted Danish clones; plus additional 43-clone controls).
    - Microsatellite markers used to estimate clone proportions within mesocosms; data include timepoint, clone identity, and population-level proportions.
- Data Quality and Structure
  - All datasets quality-checked, verified, and processed for analysis.
  - Data provided as CSV with clearly described columns and metadata for each dataset.
  - Detailed methodological descriptions available for each data type (instrumentation, sampling, laboratory analyses, and analysis pipelines).
- Relevance for Environmental Monitoring and Analysis
  - Demonstrates integration of high-frequency physical data with ecological, phenotypic, and genetic endpoints to assess ecosystem resilience under climate stress.
  - Enables examination of how genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity modulate ecosystem function and responses to repeated heat stress.
  - Provides standardized, multi-dimensional datasets suitable for cross-study comparisons, meta-analyses, and policy-relevant environmental health assessments.
