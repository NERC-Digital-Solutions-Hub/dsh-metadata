# Limits to adaptation: Causes and consequences for ecology and ecosystem function

- A large-scale mesocosm experiment (42 3000L mesocosms) in Ness Botanical Gardens (UK) to investigate how genetic diversity and intrinsic plasticity in Daphnia magna influence ecosystem responses to repeated heatwaves.
- Design features:
  - 7 treatments manipulating genetic diversity, plasticity, and heatwave exposure (with controls and varying clonal origins, including maladapted Danish clones).
  - Mesocosm layout organized in blocks; treatments include high/low/mixed plasticity and different heatwave regimes.
  - Two summer heatwaves implemented to mimic real heat events, plus a control condition without heatwaves for comparison.
- Data collected over about two years, with multiple data streams to capture thermal environment, biology, and community responses.

## Experimental design details

- Treatments examine interactions between:
  - Genetic diversity (clone composition)
  - Phenotypic plasticity (high, low, mixed)
  - Heatwave exposure (frequency/intensity)
- Clones sourced from Brown Moss and other populations; some treatments include maladapted Danish clones.
- Experiments run in a controlled mesocosm system with real-time temperature manipulation and monitoring.

## Datasets and what they contain

- Data Set 1 – Hourly temperature
  - 42 mesocosms; July 2017 – September 2019
  - 5-minute interval temperature data; two defined heatwaves each year for all mesocosms except selected heatwave controls
  - Data file: temp_hourly_Jul17_Sept19.csv (10.8 MB)

- Data Set 2 – Environmental parameters
  - Biogeochemical and physical water quality metrics (chlorophyll, oxygen, pH, conductivity, nutrients, light, etc.)
  - Includes presence/absence of D. magna and treatment identifiers
  - Data file: ecosystems.bothyrs.csv (164 KB)

- Data Set 3 – Phenotypic evolution
  - Life-history traits and heat tolerance (CT max) measured at five timepoints under common garden conditions
  - Variables: age and size at maturity, juvenile and adult growth, offspring counts and sizes, heat tolerance metrics, etc.
  - Data file: MA1to6data.csv (169 KB)

- Data Set 4 – Community data
  - Zooplankton community composition sampled at eight timepoints
  - Depth-integrated sampling, counts by taxa (e.g., Daphnia species, other zooplankton, and invertebrates)
  - Data file: fullComm_CS0added.csv (58 KB)

- Data Set 5 – Clone frequency changes
  - Genotyping of D. magna across multiple timepoints to track clonal composition
  - Two clonal sets (six clones each for some treatments; up to 43 clones in others)
  - Microsatellite markers used; proportions of each clone recorded per mesocosm and timepoint
  - Data file: Clone_proportions.csv (31 KB)

- Data quality control
  - All datasets were checked, verified, and processed for analysis.

## Data structure and metadata

- Data are provided as CSV files with clearly defined columns per dataset (e.g., time, mesocosm, treatment, clone identity, measurements, and derived variables).
- Field and lab methods are described for each dataset (sampling intervals, measurement techniques, lab rearing conditions for phenotypic assays, and PCR/genotyping protocols for clone frequencies).

## Access and references

- File-level details provided for data availability (file names, timeframes, sample sizes, and measurement types).
- References for background and context:

  - Plaistow & Collin (2014) Phenotypic integration plasticity in Daphnia magna

## How this data can be used

- Analyze how heatwave exposure interacts with genetic diversity and plasticity to shape ecosystem-level outcomes (e.g., primary production proxies, community structure, and trophic interactions).
- Examine phenotypic evolution across time under repeated thermal stress using life-history traits and heat-tolerance data.
- Link environmental parameters with community composition and Daphnia clonal turnover to understand drivers of ecosystem resilience or vulnerability.
- Develop predictive models of adaptation limits by integrating temperature histories, phenotypic data, and community/clone dynamics.
- Facilitate cross-dataset analyses by combining temperature records, environmental chemistry, phenotypic data, community surveys, and genotype frequency data.
