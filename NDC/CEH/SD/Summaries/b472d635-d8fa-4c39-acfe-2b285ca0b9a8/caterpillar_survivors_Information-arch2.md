# Experimental design/collection method

- Objective and scope
  - Measure host specificity of Maculinea rebeli caterpillars by comparing the proportion adopted into Myrmica nests with the proportion that survive to adulthood or pupation.
  - Data come from one population in southeastern Poland near Przemyśl, collected across four years: 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005.

- Methods and data collection
  - Adoption estimate (larvae to nests)
    - Baiting for ants beneath stratified random samples of gentians.
    - Counting the number of eggs on each plant to estimate larval adoption.
  - Adult estimates (survival to adulthood)
    - Recording eclosing Maculinea rebeli along stratified transects across sites.
    - Identifying the nest after confirming it contained an empty pupal case.
  - Nest sampling considerations
    - Nests were sampled randomly and are distinct within years.
    - No systematic effort to prevent sampling the same nest in subsequent years; colonies can vacate and move, making it unlikely but uncertain whether the same ants were observed across years.

- Datasets and file structure
  - sabuleti.csv
    - Data from Myrmica sabuleti nests.
    - Columns: Observation (measurement sequence), Year (data collection year), Frequency (number of Maculinea rebeli found in M. sabuleti nests).
  - scabrinodis.csv
    - Data from Myrmica scabrinodis nests.
    - Columns: Observation, Year, Frequency (number of Maculinea rebeli found in M. scabrinodis nests).

- Data quality, scope, and potential biases
  - Uses standardized sampling (stratified sampling, transects) to enable temporal comparisons.
  - The lack of marks on nests across years introduces uncertainty about whether the same colonies/ants were observed year to year.
  - Adoption estimates rely on plant-based baiting and egg counts, while adult estimates rely on eclosing individuals and nest confirmation, which may have differing detection biases.

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and analysis
  - Provides structured, time-series data on host-parasite interactions (butterfly–ant system) suitable for trend analysis across years and ant species.
  - Data are organized for straightforward aggregation and visualization (counts by nest species and year) and can be uploaded to environmental data portals.
  - Potential to integrate with broader environmental datasets to contextualize host specificity relative to habitat quality, climate, or nest composition.
