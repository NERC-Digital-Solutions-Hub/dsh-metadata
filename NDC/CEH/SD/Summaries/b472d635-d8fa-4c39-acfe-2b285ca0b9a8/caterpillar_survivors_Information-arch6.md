# Experimental design/collection method

- Overview
  - Purpose: Assess host specificity of Maculinea rebeli by comparing the proportion of caterpillars adopted into different Myrmica nests with the proportion that survived to adulthood or pupation.
  - Setting: One population sampled over four years (2001, 2003, 2004, 2005) near Przemyśl, southeast Poland.
  - Adoption measure: Proportion of larvae adopted estimated via baiting for ants beneath stratified random samples of gentians and counting eggs on each plant.
  - Adult estimate: Data are adult estimates of Maculinea rebeli obtained by recording eclosing individuals along stratified transects and identifying the nest after confirming an empty pupal case.

- Data collection methods
  - Adoption: Stratified random sampling of gentians; bait ants and count eggs to estimate larval adoption.
  - Adults: Stratified transects across sites; record eclosing Maculinea rebeli and verify nest status with empty pupal case.

- Data fields and structure
  - Common fields across datasets:
    - Observation (number)
    - Year
    - Frequency (count of Maculinea rebeli)

- Sampling design notes and limitations
  - Nests sampled randomly and are distinct within each year.
  - No measures to prevent sampling the same nest in multiple years; colonies relocate, so same ants are unlikely but not verifiably excluded.
  - Cross-year comparability may be affected by nest turnover and potential repeated measures.

- Data quality considerations
  - Data are adult counts derived from eclosing individuals and nest verification, subject to colony movement and potential re-use across years.
  - Interpretation should account for possible non-independence due to nest relocation and year-to-year dynamics.

- Potential uses for data
  - Analyze host specificity by comparing nest species (sab uleti vs scabrinodis) and year.
  - Assess adoption versus adult survival patterns.
  - Explore spatial/temporal trends in Maculinea rebeli within the studied population.
