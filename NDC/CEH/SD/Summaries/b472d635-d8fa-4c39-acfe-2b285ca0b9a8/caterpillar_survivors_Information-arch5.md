# Experimental design/collection method

- Location and timeframe: Single population near Przemyśl, south-eastern Poland; data collected across four years (2001, 2003, 2004, 2005).
- Study focus: Proportion of caterpillars adopted into Myrmica nests vs survival to adulthood/pupation; adult estimates of Maculinea rebeli.
- Data collection methods:
  - Adoption proxy: Baiting for ants beneath stratified random samples of gentians; count eggs on each plant to estimate larval/adoption proportions.
  - Adult estimates: Record eclosing Maculinea rebeli along stratified transects; identify the nest after confirming it contains an empty pupal case.
- Sampling notes and caveats:
  - Nests were sampled randomly and are distinct within years.
  - No active measures to prevent sampling the same nest in subsequent years; colonies vacate and relocate, so same ants are unlikely but not provably excluded.
  - This introduces potential non-independence across years and possible repeated sampling of the same biological units.
