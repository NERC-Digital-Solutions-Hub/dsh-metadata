# Experimental design/collection method

- Objective: measure host (Myrcica) specificity of Maculinea rebeli by comparing the proportion adopted into nests with the proportion that survived to adulthood or pupation.
- Study location and duration: one population near Przemyśl, southeast Poland; data collected over four years (2001, 2003, 2004, 2005).
- Adoption measurement: proportion of larvae adopted estimated by baiting for ants beneath stratified random samples of gentians; eggs counted on each plant to estimate adoption rates.
- Adult estimates: Maculinea rebeli adults recorded by eclosing individuals along stratified transects; nest identified after confirming an empty pupal case.
- Sampling notes: nests were sampled randomly and are distinct within years; no active measures to prevent re-sampling the same nest in later years, and nests may relocate, so same ants may not be present across years. However, certainty of re-sampling the same ants cannot be guaranteed.
- Data files and structure:
  - sabuleti.csv: data from Myrmica sabuleti nests; columns include Observation (number), Year, Frequency (number of Maculinea rebeli found in nests).
  - scabrinodis.csv: data from Myrmica scabrinodis nests; columns include Observation (number), Year, Frequency (number of Maculinea rebeli found in nests).
