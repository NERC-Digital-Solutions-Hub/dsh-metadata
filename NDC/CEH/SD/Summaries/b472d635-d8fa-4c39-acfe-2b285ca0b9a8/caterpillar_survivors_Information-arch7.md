# Experimental design/collection method

- Purpose and approach
  - Investigates host specificity of Maculinea rebeli by comparing the proportion of caterpillars adopted into different Myrmica nests with the proportion that survived to adulthood or pupation.
  - Data comprise adult estimates of M. rebeli obtained by recording eclosing individuals along stratified transects and identifying nests after confirming empty pupal cases.
- Study scope and timing
  - One population studied near Przemyśl, southeast Poland.
  - Data collected over four years: 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005.
- Adoption assessment method
  - Proportion of larvae adopted estimated by baiting for ants beneath stratified random samples of gentians and by counting the number of eggs on each plant.
- Data sampling notes and limitations
  - Nests were sampled randomly and are distinct within years.
  - No active measures to prevent sampling the same nest in subsequent years; nests may vacate and move.
  - It cannot be guaranteed that the same ants were observed across years, though this is unlikely.
