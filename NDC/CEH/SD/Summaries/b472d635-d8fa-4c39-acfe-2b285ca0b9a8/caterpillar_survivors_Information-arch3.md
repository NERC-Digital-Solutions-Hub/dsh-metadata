# Experimental design/collection method

- Objective
  - Measure host specificity by comparing the proportion of caterpillars adopted into different Myrmica nests with the proportion that survive to adulthood or pupation.

- Study context
  - Data collected from one population over four years: 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005.
  - Location: near Przemyśl, south-east Poland.

- Data collection methods
  - Adoption measure: estimated the proportion of larvae adopted by ants by baiting for ants beneath stratified random samples of gentians and by counting the number of eggs on each plant.
  - Adult emergence measure: obtained as adult estimates of Maculinea rebeli by recording eclosing individuals along stratified transects across sites, and identifying the nest after confirming an empty pupal case.

- Sampling design and notes
  - Nests were sampled randomly and are distinct within each year.
  - There were no active measures to prevent resampling the same nest in subsequent years.
  - Colonies vacate nest sites and move, making it unlikely that identical ants were observed across years; however, certainty of re-sampling the same individuals cannot be ruled out.

- Data files and structure
  - sabuleti.csv: Data from Maculinea rebeli nests in Myrmica sabuleti.
  - scabrinodis.csv: Data from Maculinea rebeli nests in Myrmica scabrinodis.
  - Common structure in both files:
    - Observation: Observation number.
    - Year: Year of data collection.
    - Frequency: Number of Maculinea rebeli found in the corresponding nests.

- Data interpretation considerations
  - Counts reflect adult emergence (eclosing individuals) counted along transects and/or nest presence after pupation checks.
  - Yearly and nest-level variation should be considered when evaluating host specificity and trends over time.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a longitudinal, nest-based monitoring approach to assess host-parasite (butterfly-ant) interactions.
  - Highlights data challenges relevant to monitoring: potential non-independence across years, need for clear nest identification, and reliance on counts that may be influenced by nest mobility and sampling scope.
