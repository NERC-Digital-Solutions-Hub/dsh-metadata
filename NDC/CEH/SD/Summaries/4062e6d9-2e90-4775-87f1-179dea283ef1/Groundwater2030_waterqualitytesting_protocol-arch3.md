# Sample collection and fieldwork

- An approximately 500 ml water sample was collected from each well using a stainless steel sampling cup rinsed several times in well water, then transferred to sterile plastic bottles on ice and kept in the dark; all samples processed within seven hours. The microbiology sample was taken before any physico-chemical tests to avoid cross-contamination.

## Field measurements

- pH measured with a Hanna Instruments HI-98128 Pocket pHep5, energy of measurement includes a digital thermometer for water temperature; the thermometer was not calibrated.
- Depth to water below ground level (bgl) measured at an accessible point with a dipper probe; readings used to calculate water depth by subtracting the depth-to-water from the plinth-adjusted depth; probe lowered to water surface until alarm sounded, then to the bottom of the well.
- Conductivity measured with a COND3110 handheld meter, calibrated with appropriate standard solutions; calibration steps followed.
- Turbidity measured with a Hanna Instruments HI 93703 Portable Turbidity Meter; the sample cell rinsed between samples, then rinsed three times with the sample before reading.

## Laboratory instrumentation and analytical methods

- Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) quantified using the membrane filtration method with MLSB medium; 100 ml of sample (or suitable dilution) filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane, incubated at 44 ± 0.5 °C for 20 ± 2 hours; colonies counted and standardized to 100 ml; no additional confirmation tests performed.
- Elevated nitrate and chloride often associated with contamination; nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, fluoride, and chloride concentrations measured using a Palintest photometer model 7100 with dedicated reagents per manufacturer’s instructions.

## Calibration steps and values

- Incubator temperature checked and adjusted before each sampling campaign; checked every two days during the campaign using a liquid thermometer (the thermometer used for incubator calibration had not itself been calibrated against a reference thermometer).
- pH meter calibrated every morning using fresh standard buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0; standard solutions traceable to NIST.
- Conductivity meter calibrated before each campaign with a 1413 µS standard solution; checked every morning; recalibrated if readings varied from the standard.
- Turbidity meter calibrated each morning against a formazin standard provided by the meter’s manufacturer.

## Quality control

- Analytical quality control was limited by available facilities; sample blanks were run for each analytical method including microbiological tests.
- When possible (depending on kit capacity), duplicate analyses were performed on the first and last sample of a batch to assess repeatability.
- Throughout each sampling campaign, the same analyst performed the tests to reduce variation.
