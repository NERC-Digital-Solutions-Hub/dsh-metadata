# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Aim and context
- Follow-up study to the 2002–2004 baseline to assess groundwater quality, sanitary risk, and usage patterns in Kisumu, Kenya.
- Expand sampling to additional neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and include boreholes; describe groundwater use through owner and neighbour customer interviews.
- Collaborate across multiple institutions to inform sustainable groundwater safety in peri-urban settings.

## Collaborators and funding
- Coordinating institution: University of Southampton; partners: VIRED International, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology (JOOUST, Kenya), University of Surrey.
- Funded by Natural Environment Research Council / Department for International Development (NERC/DFID).

## Study design and components
- Two main components:
  - Repeat sanitary risk inspections of wells and water quality testing.
  - Questionnaires with well owners and with customers who buy groundwater.
- Design builds on the 2002–04 protocol, with additional neighbourhoods and expanded sampling.

## Sampling, participants, and locations
- Sampling frame extended from 51 wells (2002–04) to 73 wells across Kisumu, including Manyatta, Migosi, and newly added areas (Nyalenda, Bandani); boreholes included.
- Source selection: random point in each neighbourhood to identify the closest groundwater source; boreholes selected from groundwater abstraction licence records.
- Participants: adults (18+) who are well owners or groundwater consumers; 137 groundwater customers interviewed; some participants are reincluded from the earlier study while others are new due to changes in ownership.

## Data collection, instruments, and analyses
- Tools archived for use in this study:
  - Pro-forma survey for groundwater sources.
  - Owner interview questionnaire.
  - Customer interview questionnaire (for those buying groundwater).
- Procedures at each site:
  - Obtain informed consent; record GPS location; take a photo; measure depth where feasible.
  - Conduct a sanitary risk assessment (on-site observation of hazards at the well head and surroundings).
  - Take two water samples: one for on-site electro-conductivity and one for laboratory analysis.
  - Transport samples in a cooler for laboratory processing.
  - Laboratory analysis at VIRED International and University of Surrey for microbiological indicators (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
- Additional data collection:
  - JOOUST-led interviews with well owners about abstraction, usage, alternative water sources, and access to assets/services (using DHS-like modules and poverty indicators adapted from prior instruments).

## Procedures and timeline
- September 2013: Start-up stakeholder workshop with well owners and community groups.
- December 2013: Sample selection; questionnaires translated into Luo and Kiswahili.
- January 2014: JOOUST students trained in informed consent and administering instruments.
- February–March 2014: Fieldwork to locate wells, obtain consent, conduct sanitary risk inspections, collect water samples; owner and customer interviews conducted.
- April 2015 (version 3 of protocol): Documentation of procedures and ongoing refinements.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop to share findings with stakeholders.

## Ethics, engagement, and dissemination
- Commitment to stakeholder engagement through initial and final workshops.
- Informed consent obtained from well owners; customers recruited through owners and through customers at wells.
- Findings processed by collaborating institutions and disseminated to local communities and partners to support groundwater safety decisions.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a longitudinal, multi-component monitoring approach combining:
  - Repeated sanitary risk assessments with microbiological and chemical water testing.
  - Direct engagement with both sources of groundwater and end-users (customers).
  - Use of standardized instruments and translations to enable comparability over time.
- Emphasizes capacity building and local collaboration (JOOUST training; community workshops).
- Provides a data-rich protocol that aligns with governance and transparency goals, including documentation of data collection tools and procedures for potential replication or adaptation in similar peri-urban settings.
