# Sample collection and laboratory methodologies for groundwater quality assessment

## Overview
- Approximately 500 ml water samples collected from each well using rinsed stainless steel cups; samples stored on ice in the dark and processed within seven hours.
- Microbiology sample collected before physico-chemical tests to prevent cross-contamination.

## Field measurements and handling
- In situ pH measured with a calibrated Hanna HI-98128 pH tester; integrated digital thermometer used for water temperature (thermometer not separately calibrated).
- Depth to water below ground level (bgl) measured at each well using a dipper probe and calibrated tape; adjustments made for plinth height; water depth calculated as difference between surface and bottom readings.
- Conductivity measured with a COND3110 handheld meter; calibrated with standard solutions.
- Turbidity measured with a Hanna HI 93703 turbidity meter; sample cell rinsed between samples.

## Laboratory instrumentation and methods
- Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) determined by membrane filtration using MLSB medium; 100 ml (or appropriate dilution) filtered, incubated at 44 ± 0.5°C for 20 ± 2 hours; colonies counted (cream to yellow, >1 mm) and standardized to 100 ml; no further confirmation tests performed.
- Nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, fluoride, and chloride concentrations measured using a Palintest photometer model 7100 with dedicated reagents per manufacturer instructions.

## Calibration steps and values
- Incubator temperature checked and adjusted before each sampling campaign; checked every two days with a liquid thermometer (thermometer itself not previously calibrated against a reference).
- pH meter calibrated each morning with buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0; standards traceable to NIST.
- Conductivity meter calibrated before each campaign with a 1413 µS standard; checked daily and recalibrated if readings varied.
- Turbidity meter calibrated daily against a formazin standard.

## Quality control and data handling
- Analytical blanks run for each method; where possible (DelAgua kit max 16 samples), duplicate analyses conducted on first and last samples to assess repeatability.
- Tests performed by the same analyst within a single sampling campaign to reduce intra-campaign variability.

## Implications for GIS data products
- Data collected at multiple wells with time-stamped field measurements and laboratory results (pH, temperature, depth to water, conductivity, turbidity, TTC, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, fluoride, chloride).
- Requires georeferenced well locations, event dates (baseline and follow-up), and consistent units/definitions for comparable map-based visualization.
- Calibration and QA details should be included in metadata to support data quality assessments and lineage in GIS analyses.
- Potential data challenges include incomplete datasets, varying data resolutions, and the need to standardize across campaigns for reliable spatial-temporal analysis.
