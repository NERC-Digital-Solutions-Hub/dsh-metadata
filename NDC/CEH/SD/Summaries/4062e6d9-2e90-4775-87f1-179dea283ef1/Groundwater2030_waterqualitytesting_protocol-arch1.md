# Sample collection and fieldwork

- Approximately 500 ml water samples were collected from each well using a rinsed stainless steel sampling cup and transferred into sterile plastic bottles on ice, stored in the dark, and processed within seven hours. The microbiology sample was taken before physico-chemical tests to prevent cross-contamination.
- Field measurements:
  - pH measured with a Hanna HI-98128 pH tester calibrated with standard solutions; integrated thermometer provided water temperature readings but the thermometer itself was not calibrated.
  - Depth to water below ground level (bgl) measured at each well using a dipper probe and calibrated tape; readings adjusted for plinth height; depth to water calculated from the difference between surface and bottom measurements.
  - Conductivity measured with a COND3110 handheld meter calibrated with standard solutions.
  - Turbidity measured with a Hanna HI 93703 turbidity meter; sample cell rinsed between samples and with the sample before reading.
- Laboratory instrumentation and analytical methods:
  - Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) quantified by membrane filtration using MLSB medium; 100 ml (or appropriate dilution) filtered, incubated at 44 ± 0.5 °C for 20 ± 2 hours; colonies counted and standardised to 100 ml; no further confirmation tests conducted.
  - Nitrate, sulphate, phosphate, fluoride, and chloride concentrations measured with a Palintest photometer model 7100 using dedicated reagents.
- Calibration steps and values:
  - Incubator temperature checked and adjusted before each sampling campaign and rechecked every two days; the incubator thermometer used for calibration had not been calibrated against a reference thermometer.
  - pH meter calibrated each morning with buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0; standards traceable to NIST.
  - Conductivity meter calibrated before each campaign with a 1413 µS standard; checked daily and recalibrated if readings varied.
  - Turbidity meter calibrated each morning against a formazin standard.
- Quality control:
  - Analytical quality control was challenging due to facility limitations; sample blanks included for each method, including microbiological tests.
  - Duplicate analyses were performed for the maximum batch size (up to 16 samples) to assess repeatability.
  - Throughout each campaign, the same analyst conducted the tests to reduce variation.
