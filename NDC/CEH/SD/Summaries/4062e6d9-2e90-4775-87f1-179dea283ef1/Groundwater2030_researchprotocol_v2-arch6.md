# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- A follow-up study to the 2002–2004 groundwater quality and well integrity survey in Kisumu, Kenya, with two components: repeat sanitary risk inspection and water quality testing, plus questionnaire interviews with well owners and customers.
- Expands sampling to additional Kisumu neighborhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and includes boreholes; aims to describe patterns of groundwater use and changes since 2004.

## Aim and scope
- Assess current groundwater safety and the factors influencing risk in peri-urban Kisumu.
- Compare with baseline data from 2002–2004 to identify changes in contamination and well conditions.
- Gather complementary data on water use, ownership, and customer behavior to inform policy and practice.

## Methodology
- Two components:
  - Repeat sanitary risk inspection (well head and surroundings) and water quality testing.
  - Questionnaire interviews with well owners and, where groundwater is sold, with neighboring customers who purchase the water.
- Sampling extended beyond original wells to include more neighborhoods; random location sampling for most sources; boreholes selected from licensing records.

## Materials and instruments
- Pro-forma for surveying groundwater sources.
- Questionnaires:
  - Well owner questionnaire (demographics, water use, handling, assets, services).
  - Well customer questionnaire (use, handling, other water sources, assets, and food-related indicators).
- Instruments for data capture and processing:
  - Handheld GPS for precise location.
  - Digital photography of sources.
  - Depth measurement where feasible.
  - On-site electro-conductivity measurement; laboratory tests for thermotolerant coliforms and chemical contaminants.
- Ethical materials:
  - Participant information sheets and consent forms.

## Sampling and participants
- Sampling frame: 51 sources from the 2002–2004 study, expanded to 73 sources in total.
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners and adults (18+) who consume groundwater.
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed from households purchasing well water.
- Inclusion criteria: adults 18+, resident in selected neighborhoods, owner or consumer of groundwater.

## Procedure and field workflow
- 2013 September: Stakeholder workshop to raise awareness and share objectives.
- 2013 December–2014 January: Questionnaire translation (Luo and Kiswahili); training of JOOUST students in informed consent and administration.
- February–March 2014:
  - Field teams re-visited sources from 2002–2004 to confirm owner identity, obtain consent, and locate wells.
  - If consent given, collect GPS coordinates, take photos, and record depth where possible.
  - Conduct sanitary risk inspections and collect two water samples per source (one for on-site EC, one for lab analysis).
  - Lab processing of microbiological (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants at VIRED International and University of Surrey.
  - JOOUST-led interviews with owners about abstraction, water use, and assets/services; interviews with neighboring customers about water use, other sources, and assets.
- 2014 July: Final dissemination workshop organized by VIRED International.

## Data management and integration
- Data types collected:
  - Location data (GPS), source identification and imagery, depth measurements, sanitary risk observations.
  - Water quality results (electro-conductivity on-site; lab results for bacteria and chemicals).
  - Owner and customer questionnaire responses (demographics, water use patterns, asset access, and poverty indicators).
- Data linkage:
  - Linking wells to owners and, where applicable, to customers who purchase water.
- Data handling emphasizes consistency across repeated visits and integration of field observations with lab results.

## Ethics, consent, and dissemination
- Informed consent obtained from well owners; if owner declines or source is non-functional, the team moves to a neighboring source.
- Questionnaires translated and back-translated to ensure understanding.
- Findings disseminated through stakeholder and community workshops, including final dissemination session in July 2014.

## Context and references
- Builds on Wright et al. (2013) spatial analysis of pit latrine density and groundwater contamination.
- Incorporates tools from microfinance poverty assessment (Zeller et al., 2003) and Kenyan DHS-style asset questions for consistency with national surveys.
