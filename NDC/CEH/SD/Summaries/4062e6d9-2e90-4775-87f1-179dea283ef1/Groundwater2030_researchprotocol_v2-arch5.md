# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Overview
- A two-component follow-up groundwater study in Kisumu, Kenya, building on a 2002-2004 baseline.
- Collaborative project involving University of Southampton (coordinating), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), and University of Surrey; funded by the Natural Environment Research Council / Department for International Development.
- Aims to assess groundwater safety and usage, inform governance, and support sustainable management in peri-urban areas.

## Data collected and instruments
- Sanitary risk inspections: observational checklists at well heads and surroundings.
- Water quality testing: laboratory analyses of microbiological indicators (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants; on-site electro-conductivity measurements.
- Questionnaire data: 
  - Well owner questionnaire (ownership, abstraction, handling, alternatives, assets/services, food poverty indicators).
  - Well customer questionnaire (water use, handling, other water sources, assets/services).
- Geospatial and other data: GPS coordinates, photographs of wells, depth measurements (where feasible).
- Archival materials: pro-forma survey sheet and both owner and customer questionnaires archived with the protocol.

## Sampling and participants
- Expanded sampling from 51 sources (2002-04) to 73 groundwater sources, including additional neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes.
- Participants: adults (18+) either owning groundwater sources or purchasing groundwater; 137 groundwater customers interviewed in total.
- Sampling method: re-survey of wells from the earlier study with random selection within neighbourhoods; boreholes selected via groundwater abstraction licence records.

## Procedures and timeline
- 13 Sep 2013: Start-up stakeholder workshop with local associations and community groups.
- Dec 2013: Sample selection; translation of instruments to Luo and Kiswahili.
- Jan 2014: JOOUST students trained in consent and questionnaire administration.
- Feb–Mar 2014: Fieldwork to collect owner and customer data; GPS, photos, depth, sanitary risk assessments; water samples sent to VIRED/Surry labs for analyses.
- Feb–Mar 2014: Concurrent interviewing of well owners and, where applicable, customers; inclusion of asset/service questions and food poverty indicators.
- Apr 28, 2015 (Version 3): Protocol revision and documentation.
- Jul 2014: Final dissemination workshop to share findings with stakeholders.

## Data governance, ethics, and consent
- Informed consent obtained from well owners; participant information sheets provided (translated, back-translated).
- If a well no longer existed or owner declined, replacement with a neighboring source was sought.
- Location privacy safeguarded via consent; data collection includes identifiable site information (GPS, photos) for research purposes.
- Data collection aligns with earlier study to enable temporal comparison (2004 vs. 2014/2015).

## Data management and archiving
- Measurement tools and questionnaires are archived alongside the protocol for reproducibility.
- Data collection structured to capture provenance and changes since 2004 (e.g., sanitary risk changes, depth, usage patterns).
- Laboratory analyses conducted collaboratively by VIRED and University of Surrey; samples transported under controlled conditions.

## Data quality, interoperability, and limitations
- No formal power calculations; sample size predetermined by the previous baseline study with supplementary neighbourhoods as a pilot.
- Fieldwork encountered issues such as wells not existing or ownership changes; substitutions were implemented.
- Use of standardized instruments (pro-forma and validated questionnaires) to improve comparability across sites and time.
- Documentation supports comparability with the 2002-04 study and future analyses, though explicit data repository or machine-readable metadata standards are not specified in the protocol.

## Dissemination and potential data-sharing pathways
- Final workshop in July 2014 to disseminate findings to the well owners’ association and community groups.
- Data collected (locations, ownership, usage, quality metrics) are suitable for integration into groundwater safety governance discussions and future datasets, pending formal data-sharing arrangements and metadata curation.
