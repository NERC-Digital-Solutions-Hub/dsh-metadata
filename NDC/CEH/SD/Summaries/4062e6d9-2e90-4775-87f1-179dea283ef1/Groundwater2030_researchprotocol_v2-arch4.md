# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Overview
- Follow-up study to 2002–2004 groundwater quality and well structure survey in Kisumu, Kenya.
- Aims to reassess sanitary risk, water quality, and patterns of groundwater use; expand sampling to additional neighborhoods; include consumer perspectives.

## Study Design and Aims
- Collaboration among University of Southampton (coordinating), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), and University of Surrey; funded by NERC/DFID.
- Two-component study: repeat sanitary risk inspection and water quality testing on previously studied wells; add owner and customer questionnaires to describe groundwater use and handling.
- Expanded sampling to include new neighborhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes; build on the earlier sampling frame from the baseline study.

## Data Collected and Instruments
- Types of data:
  - Spatial: GPS locations of wells; photos of groundwater sources.
  - Field observations: sanitary risk assessments (well head and surroundings).
  - Water quality: on-site electro-conductivity measurement; laboratory tests for microbiological indicators (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
  - Questionnaires: well owner interviews; well customer interviews (if water is sold to neighbors); translated into Luo and Kiswahili; adapted assets/services and food poverty modules.
- Tools archived:
  - Pro-forma survey form for groundwater sources.
  - Owner questionnaire.
  - Customer questionnaire.

## Sampling and Participants
- Wells: 73 groundwater sources tested (extension from 51 in the earlier study; includes boreholes).
- Neighborhoods: Manyatta, Migosi (original); expanded to Nyalenda and Bandani.
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners (adults 18+).
  - Groundwater customers (adults 18+ who purchase water from wells), with replacements if participation declined.
- Sampling approach:
  - Random point method to select groundwater sources within neighborhoods; boreholes chosen from groundwater abstraction license records.
  - Some wells no longer exist or functional; nearest neighboring source selected in those cases.
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed in total.

## Procedures and Timeline
- 13 Sep 2013: Start-up stakeholder workshop with local groups.
- Dec 2013: Sample selection; translation of questionnaires.
- Jan 2014: JOOUST students trained in consent and questionnaire administration.
- Feb–Mar 2014: Fieldwork at wells; identification of owners; consent process; GPS tagging; photos; depth measurement where feasible; sanitary risk inspection; water samples collected for on-site EC and lab analysis.
- Feb–Mar 2014: JOOUST-led interviews of well owners and neighboring customers; asset/services questions; food poverty module included.
- 28 Apr 2015: Version 3 of protocol.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop.

## Data Quality, Analysis, and Governance
- Standardized methods: sanitary risk checklists; laboratory analyses conducted by VIRED International and University of Surrey.
- Data provenance: linkage to 2002–2004 baseline via maps; assessment of changes since prior study.
- Sample size rationale: no formal power calculations; follow-up study with pilot intent; estimated >0.9 power for detecting a 0.5 log change in faecal coliforms under assumptions similar to baseline.
- Data management: archiving of measurement tools and questionnaires; geospatial and observational data integrated with questionnaire data.

## Ethics, Consent, and Dissemination
- Informed consent obtained from well owners; information sheets provided and explained; translation/back-translation to local languages to support understanding.
- Dissemination through stakeholder workshops and final dissemination events with local communities.

## Data Management and Access
- Data collected across multiple sites and institutions; emphasis on data integration (GPS, observations, lab results, and survey responses).
- Materials and datasets prepared for archiving and potential sharing within the research consortium.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates longitudinal, multi-source data integration (environmental measurements, geospatial data, and social surveys) across institutions.
- Highlights governance considerations: consent, language translation, data provenance, and ethical dissemination.
- Shows handling of data gaps and changes over time (ownership changes, wells no longer functioning) with a plan to treat as pilot expansion.
- Underlines the value of linking data collection to policy-relevant outcomes through community engagement and stakeholder workshops.
