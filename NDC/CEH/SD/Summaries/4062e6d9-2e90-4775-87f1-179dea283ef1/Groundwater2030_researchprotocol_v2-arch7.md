# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Overview
- Follow-up, multi-institutional protocol in Kisumu, Kenya, building on a 2002-04 baseline study to assess groundwater safety.
- Two-part study: repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing, plus interviews with well owners and some neighboring customers who buy groundwater.
- Expanded sampling to additional neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes; aim to map and analyse spatial patterns of groundwater use and contamination risk.

## Geospatial data and GIS-relevant methods
- Groundwater sources identified and located using GPS; exact coordinates recorded at each site.
- High-resolution data collection includes site photographs and, when possible, depth measurements.
- Use of maps from previous studies to re-identify sources and track changes over a decade (2004–2014).
- random-point sampling in each neighbourhood to select sources; boreholes chosen from groundwater abstraction licence records.
- Spatial analysis potential: track sanitary risk hazards by location, overlay with water quality results, and assess exposure patterns among owners and customers.

## Sampling and participants
- Sources: 73 groundwater sources tested (increase from 51 in the earlier study); includes boreholes.
- Participants: 18+ year-old groundwater source owners (and, where applicable, customers who purchase water).
- Customer interviews: 137 sampled customers from households purchasing well water.
- Inclusion criteria: residency in chosen Kisumu neighbourhoods (Manyatta, Migosi, plus newer sites) and either ownership or consumption of groundwater.

## Data collection instruments
- Groundwater source survey pro-forma.
- Well owner questionnaire (ownership, usage, assets/services access, and related factors).
- Well customer questionnaire (water usage, handling, and access to services/poverty indicators).
- Additional instruments adapted from DHS and other Kenyan surveys (assets, food poverty measures).

## Procedures and workflow
- 2013 stakeholder workshop to align objectives with local groups.
- December 2013: sample selection; questionnaires translated into Luo and Kiswahili.
- January 2014: JOOUST students trained in consent and instrument administration.
- Feb–Mar 2014: fieldwork for site identification, consent, GPS mapping, photography, depth measurement, and sanitary risk assessment.
- Water sampling: two samples per source—one for on-site electro-conductivity, one for laboratory analysis of microbiological and chemical contaminants.
- February–March: JOOUST-led interviews with well owners and identified customers; additional questions on water use, other water sources, and asset/services access.
- 2014–2015: dissemination via final workshops; ongoing data archiving.

## Data products and outputs (GIS-ready)
- Geolocated dataset of groundwater sources with:
  - Source identity, coordinates, depth, and photos.
  - Sanitary risk assessment results.
  - On-site EC measures and laboratory results for thermotolerant coliforms and chemical contaminants.
  - Owner and customer questionnaire responses (water use, handling, consumption patterns, assets/services access).
- Temporal comparison dataset to assess changes since 2004 baseline.
- Potential GIS outputs: risk maps, supply networks, and spatial patterns of groundwater use and contamination hotspots.

## Collaboration, ethics, and dissemination
- Multinational team: University of Southampton (coordination), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), University of Surrey.
- Informed consent obtained from all participants; stakeholder engagement through workshops.
- Outputs include published references and dissemination via workshops and partner networks.
