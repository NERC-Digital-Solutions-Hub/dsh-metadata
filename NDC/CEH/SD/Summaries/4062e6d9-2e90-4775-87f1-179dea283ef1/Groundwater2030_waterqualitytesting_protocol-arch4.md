# Sample collection and fieldwork

- Sampling protocol: Approximately 500 ml water collected from each well using a stainless steel sampling cup rinsed several times in well water; samples transferred to sterile bottles, stored on ice in the dark, and processed within seven hours; microbiology samples collected before any physico-chemical tests to avoid cross-contamination.
- In-field measurements:
  - pH measured with a Hanna Instruments HI-98128 Pocket pHep5, using standard buffers; integrated digital thermometer used to measure water temperature (thermometer not calibrated).
  - Depth to water below ground level (bgl) measured at an accessible dipper point, adjusting for plinth height; depth to water calculated as the difference between surface and bottom readings.
  - Conductivity measured with a COND3110 handheld meter calibrated with standard solutions.
  - Turbidity measured with a Hanna HI 93703 Portable Turbidity Meter; sample cell rinsed with distilled water between samples and then with the sample three times before reading.
- Laboratory instrumentation and analytical methods:
  - Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) quantified by membrane filtration using MLSB medium; 100 ml (or appropriate dilution) filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane, incubated at 44 ± 0.5°C for 20 ± 2 hours; colonies counted and standardised to 100 ml; no further confirmation tests performed.
  - Nitrate, sulphate, phosphate, fluoride, and chloride concentrations measured with a Palintest photometer model 7100 using dedicated reagents per manufacturer instructions.
- Calibration steps and values:
  - Incubator temperature checked and adjusted before each campaign and checked every two days during the campaign; incubator thermometer not calibrated against a reference thermometer.
  - pH meter calibrated daily with standard buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0; standard solutions traceable to N.I.S.T.
  - Conductivity meter calibrated before each campaign with a 1413 µS standard; checked daily for consistency; recalibrated if readings varied.
  - Turbidity meter calibrated daily against a formazin standard.
- Quality control:
  - Analytical quality control limited by laboratory facilities; blanks run for each method, including microbiological tests.
  - When possible (within a DelAgua kit's 16-sample capacity), duplicate analyses performed on the first and last samples to assess repeatability.
  - All tests conducted by the same analyst during a campaign to reduce variability.
- Key data considerations for data leaders:
  - Clear documentation of sample volumes, units, and standard references (e.g., N.I.S.T. traceability for pH buffers; specific instrument models) to support data provenance and reproducibility.
  - Identification of calibration limitations (e.g., incubator thermometer not calibrated) and QC constraints (limited duplicate testing, limited confirmatory tests) to inform data quality assessments and gap analysis.
