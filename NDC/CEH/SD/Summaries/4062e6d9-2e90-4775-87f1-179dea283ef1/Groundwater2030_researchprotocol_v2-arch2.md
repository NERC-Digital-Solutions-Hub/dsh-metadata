# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Aim
- Conduct a follow-up survey in Kisumu, Kenya to assess groundwater safety in peri-urban areas (Manyatta and Migosi; expanded to Nyalenda and Bandani; include boreholes).
- Replicate and extend the 2002-2004 baseline study to evaluate changes in water quality and wellhead sanitary risk, and to describe patterns of groundwater use through owner and consumer interviews.

## Study Design and Collaboration
- Two-component study:
  - Repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing on wells from the earlier study.
  - Questionnaires with well owners and with groundwater customers (including neighbours who purchase well water) to describe usage and handling.
- Collaborating institutions: University of Southampton (coordinating), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), University of Surrey.
- Funder: Natural Environment Research Council / Department for International Development.

## Methodology and Data Collection
- Data sources and measurements:
  - Sanitary risk inspection checklists at each well site.
  - Water quality testing for microbiological indicator bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
  - On-site measurements: electro-conductivity; depth via tape.
  - GPS location and photographic documentation.
- Sampling and scope:
  - Total of 73 groundwater sources tested (expanded from 51 in the earlier study; includes additional neighbourhoods and boreholes).
  - Sampling frame: wells revisited from 2002-04; new neighbourhoods selected by random points; boreholes chosen from Water Resources Management Authority license records.
  - Power calculations were not used to determine sample size (pilot/follow-up nature; rough power suggests >0.9 power to detect a 0.5 log change in faecal coliforms, assuming baseline conditions).
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners and groundwater customers; adults (18+); inclusion criteria include residence in selected neighbourhoods and involvement with a groundwater source (owner or consumer).
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed in total.

## Instruments and Materials
- Archived measurement tools and forms:
  - Pro-forma for surveying a groundwater source.
  - Owner interview questionnaire.
  - Customer interview questionnaire (for those buying well water).

## Procedures and Timeline
- 2013 Sept: Start-up stakeholders workshop with community groups and well owners.
- 2013 Dec: Sample selection; questionnaires translated to Luo and Kiswahili.
- 2014 Jan: JOOUST trained in informed consent and questionnaire administration.
- 2014 Feb–Mar:
  - Field teams mapped to sites used in 2002-04; identified well owners; obtained informed consent.
  - If owner declined or site unavailable, replaced with nearest neighboring source.
  - Collected GPS data, site photos, depth measurements, and performed sanitary risk assessments.
  - Collected two water samples per source: one for on-site conductivity measurement, one for laboratory analysis back at VIRED/UCS.
  - Owner and, where applicable, neighboring customers interviewed to capture water use, handling, alternative water sources, assets/services, and food poverty indicators.
- 2014 Jul: Final dissemination workshop organized by VIRED International.

## Data Management and Accessibility
- Data and materials (forms, questionnaires, maps) archived alongside the protocol.
- Revisitability and longitudinal potential highlighted through comparisons with 2002-04 baseline data and updated site conditions.

## Ethics and Consent
- Informed consent obtained from all participating well owners; if participation declined, alternative nearby sites were approached.
- Customer participation also obtained consent; replacement participants sought if a customer declined.

## Context and References
- Builds on 2002-2004 baseline study by VIRED International and University of Surrey (and Wright et al. for spatial analyses).
- Related tools and frameworks include methods for poverty assessment and asset/service indicators used in Kenyan surveys.
