# Sample collection and fieldwork

- Sample collection: ~500 ml water from each well using a rinsed stainless steel sampling cup; transferred to sterile bottles, stored on ice, in the dark; processed within seven hours; microbiology sample collected before physico-chemical tests to avoid cross-contamination.
- Field measurements:
  - pH measured with a Hanna HI-98128 Pocket pHep5 (calibrated with standard solutions); integrated thermometer used to measure water temperature; the thermometer was not calibrated.
  - Depth to water below ground level (bgl) measured at an accessible point with a dipper probe; readings adjusted for plinth depth; depth of water calculated from surface and bottom readings.
  - Conductivity measured with a COND3110 handheld meter, calibrated with standard solutions.
  - Turbidity measured with a Hanna HI 93703 turbidity meter; sample cell rinsed with distilled water between samples and three times with the sample.
- Laboratory instrumentation and analytical methods:
  - Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) isolated and quantified by membrane filtration using MLSB medium; 100 ml (or appropriate dilution) filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane; membranes placed on MLSB pads, pre-incubated, then incubated at 44 ± 0.5 °C for 20 ± 2 hours; colonies counted and standardised to 100 ml; no further confirmation tests.
  - Nitrate, sulphate, phosphate, fluoride and chloride concentrations measured using a Palintest photometer (model 7100) with dedicated reagents per manufacturer instructions (as elevated nitrate/chloride often indicate faecal contamination).
- Calibration steps and values:
  - Incubator temperature checked and adjusted before each sampling, then checked every two days during campaigns; the thermometer used for incubator calibration had not been calibrated against a reference thermometer.
  - pH meter calibrated every morning with fresh standard buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0; standards traceable to NIST.
  - Conductivity meter calibrated before each campaign with a 1413 µS standard; checked each morning for consistency; recalibrated if readings varied.
  - Turbidity meter calibrated each morning against a formazin standard supplied by the meter manufacturer.
- Quality control:
  - Analytical quality control was challenging due to lab facilities; blanks run for each method, including microbiology; when possible (DelAgua kit max 16 samples), duplicate analyses were performed on the first and last sample to assess repeatability; all tests conducted by the same analyst during a campaign to reduce variation.
