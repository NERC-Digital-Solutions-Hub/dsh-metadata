# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Aim
- Conduct a follow-up to the 2002–2004 water quality and well integrity study in Kisumu, Kenya.
- Repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing of prior wells.
- Interview well owners to describe groundwater use patterns, and interview customers who purchase well water to understand usage at the demand end.
- Extend sampling to additional Kisumu neighbourhoods and boreholes to capture broader peri-urban groundwater dynamics.

## Methodology
- Collaborative study led by University of Southampton (coordinating), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), and University of Surrey.
- Two components: (1) repeat sanitary risk inspection and water quality testing; (2) questionnaire interviews with well owners and with neighboring customers who buy water.
- Expanded sampling to include Nyalenda and Bandani neighbourhoods and boreholes, following the same protocol as the baseline study.

## Materials
- Pro-forma survey for groundwater sources.
- Questionnaires for: (a) well owners, (b) groundwater customers.
- Additional instruments aligned with Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey and poverty measurement tools (Zeller et al., 2003).

## Sampling
- No formal power calculations; sample size driven by the prior baseline study with pilot elements for expansion.
- Sampling frame: revisit wells tested in 2002–2004; add new neighbourhoods (Manyatta, Migosi, plus Nyalenda and Bandani) and boreholes.
- Random-point method to select wells within neighbourhoods; boreholes selected from Water Resource Management Authority licence records.
- Total wells tested: 73 (expanded from 51 in the earlier study).
- Participants: adults (18+) including well owners and groundwater consumers; 137 well customers interviewed.

## Participants
- Groundwater source owners and consumers residing in Kisumu’s peri-urban neighbourhoods.
- Inclusion: age 18+, resident in chosen neighbourhoods, owner or consumer of a groundwater source.
- Some participants overlapped with the 2002–2004 study; others newly recruited due to ownership changes.

## Procedure
- 13 September 2013: Stakeholder workshop with well owners’ associations and community groups.
- December 2013: Sample selection; translation of questionnaires to Luo and Kiswahili.
- January 2014: JOOUST students trained in informed consent and questionnaire administration.
- February–March 2014: Field teams re-visited 2002–2004 wells; identified owners, obtained consent, recorded GPS locations, took photos, and measured well depth where feasible.
- Sanitary risk inspection conducted at each site; basic remediation advice given for fixable hazards (e.g., missing covers).
- Water samples: two collected per well—one for on-site electro-conductivity, one for laboratory analysis.
- Laboratory analyses (VIRED International and University of Surrey): microbiological indicator bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
- January–March 2014: JOOUST-led interviews with well owners and, where water was sold to neighbours, with customers; included questions on water abstraction rates, usage, other water sources, and asset/services access.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop organized by VIRED International.

## Data and instruments
- Owner and customer questionnaires to capture usage patterns, water handling, and asset/service access.
- Geospatial data and site observations (GPS, photos, depth where possible) to support spatial analyses and change detection relative to 2002–2004 data.
- Lab results for microbiological and chemical water quality indicators.
- Poverty and household asset questions integrated to contextualize water use.

## Ethics and transparency
- Informed consent obtained from all participants; translation and back-translation of instruments to ensure comprehension.
- Training provided to local researchers to ensure standardized data collection and ethical conduct.

## Timeline and dissemination
- Data collection and analysis framed as a longitudinal extension of the prior study (2002–2004).
- Findings intended for dissemination in workshops with local communities and stakeholders (final workshop in July 2014).
