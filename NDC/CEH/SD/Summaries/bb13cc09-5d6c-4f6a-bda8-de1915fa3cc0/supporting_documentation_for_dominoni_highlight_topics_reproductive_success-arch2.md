# Nestbox Monitoring of Blue Tits and Great Tits along an Urban–Non-Urban Gradient in Scotland (2014–2022)

## Overview
- Long-term field monitoring of bird breeding along a 35 km urban–non-urban gradient in Scotland (Glasgow city centre to Loch Lomond National Park).
- Annual monitoring from 2014 to 2022, using nestboxes at multiple sites to track breeding success and phenology.

## Study Design and Gradient
- Gradient extremes: Glasgow city centre and Loch Lomond National Park.
- Sites monitored per year: between 5 and 20.
- Nestboxes deployed at each site: 5 to 161 boxes, approximately 50 metres apart.
- Target species: primarily blue tits and great tits; other species appear in the metadata as well.

## Nestbox Deployment and Field Procedures
- Nestbox specifications: Woodcrete nestboxes (26 cm height × 17 cm width × 18 cm depth; entrance hole 32 mm).
- Monitoring schedule: weekly checks during the breeding season (April–June).
- Breeding data collection process:
  - First egg date observed or back-calculated if found during laying but before incubation.
  - Clutch size recorded as the maximum observed during incubation.
  - Incubation begins after clutch is complete; nestboxes checked 14 days after incubation commenced and then every other day until chicks are observed.
  - Chicks ringed 13 days after hatching with unique metal rings.
  - Final check conducted at least 20 days after hatching; dead chicks recorded and subtracted from the count of chicks alive at day 13 to determine fledging success.
- Data scale: each row represents an individual breeding event; columns capture event-specific details.

## Data and Metadata
- Data structure: rows = individual breeding events; columns = details of each event.
- Metadata fields (examples):
  - ID (unique record number), DATA_ENTRY_ID (data entry initials), YEAR, NESTBOX_NUMBER, SITE, OCCUPIED (0/1), REPLACEMENT_CLUTCH, SPECIES (5-letter BTO codes), FIRST_EGG_DATE, LAYING_COMPLETE, CLUTCH_SIZE, CLUTCH_COMPLETE, EXPECTED_HATCH, OBSERVED_HATCH, HATCH_DEVIATION, MALE_CAUGHT, FEMALE_CAUGHT, HATCHLINGS, UNHATCHED_EGGS, FLEDGLINGS, SUCCESS, MALE_RING, FEMALE_RING, NOTES.
- Site options include multiple named locations (e.g., Balmaha, Scone, Sallochy, Cashel, Dawsholm, Drymen variants, Kelvingrove Park, etc.).
- Species codes (Table 1) include principal species:
  - BLUTI: blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus)
  - GRETI: great tit (Parus major)
  - HOUSP: house sparrow (Passer domesticus)
  - NUTHA: nuthatch (Sitta europaea)
  - PIEFL: pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca)
  - TRESP: tree sparrow (Passer montanus)

## Quality Control and Data Management
- Quality control: year-end data checks and upload to a central database.
- Data management practice: structured data storage with standardized fields to ensure consistency and traceability across years and sites.

## Outputs and Data Use
- Data are prepared in standardized formats suitable for environmental health assessments and policy performance over time.
- Outputs typically include clear formats such as reports, maps, and charts, enabling visualization of breeding success, phenology, and occupancy across the gradient.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals, enabling broader access and reuse of underlying data.

## Relevance to Environmental Monitoring Aims
- Demonstrates environmental health and policy performance through long-term, standardized breeding data.
- Provides a framework for integrating bird breeding datasets into broader environmental monitoring efforts.
- Supports data interoperability by using explicit metadata and standardized species codes and measurement protocols.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Analysts
- Challenges:
  - Maximizing the value of the breeding dataset by integrating with additional environmental or socio-ecological data.
  - Ensuring broad access to underlying data while maintaining data quality and documentation.
- Opportunities:
  - Aligning with standardised analytical approaches to compare across sites and years.
  - Enhancing outputs with spatial mapping and trend analyses to inform urban planning and conservation policies.
