# Plynlimon hydrochemistry dataset documentation

- Time period and sampling frequency: March 2019 to March 2023; samples collected every four weeks.
- Related metadata and methods files:
  - Sampling methods and field measurements: Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv
  - Sample sites: Plynlimon_site_information.csv
  - Instrumentation, units, and analytical methods: Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Data structure and metadata:
  - Full data structure details and variable descriptions are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv
  - Where possible, determinant descriptions use the CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus (CAST)
  - CAST vocabulary link: https://vocabs.ceh.ac.uk/cast/en/
- Value reporting and limits:
  - Values below the limit of detection (LOD) are reported as halfway between 0 and the LOD
  - LOD values may change over time for some chemicals, resulting in multiple rows per chemical for different subperiods
- Quality control and laboratory procedures:
  - pH, conductivity, and alkalinity analysed at CEH Bangor laboratories
  - CEH Bangor participates in the LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing scheme
  - All other chemical analyses conducted at CEH Lancaster (UKAS-accredited ISO 17025:2005 for many analyses)
  - Data checks include identification of missing values, which may arise from insufficient samples, instrument failures, field errors, or restricted sampling (e.g., Covid-related access restrictions in 2020)
- Data cleaning and consistency improvements:
  - Corrected inconsistent SO4-S naming (SO4 vs SO4-S)
  - Removed gross errors in several variables, notably chlorine (Cl)
  - Standardized units for bromide (mg/L vs µg/L)
  - Corrected swapped pH values for Afon Cyff/Gwy since August 2022
- Interpretation aids and notes:
  - Rainfall measurements for Carregwen rain (C) chemistry are recorded from a rain gauge near the Hafren (B) sample site, not at the Carregwen gauge site (AJ) to maintain consistency with previously published Plynlimon hydrochemistry data
- Data accessibility and governance:
  - Data are uploaded to relevant portals and catalogued as part of the dataset holdings
  - Documentation supports reuse, including cross-references to site information, methods, and column descriptions
- Practical considerations for data stewardship:
  - Be aware of potential multiple-LOD entries for certain chemicals
  - Ensure alignment of units and naming conventions across datasets
  - Track any future updates to LOD values and metadata fields to maintain consistency over time
