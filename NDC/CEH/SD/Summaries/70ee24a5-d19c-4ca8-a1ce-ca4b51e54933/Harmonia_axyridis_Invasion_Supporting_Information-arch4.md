# Harmonia axyridis invasion: UK distribution data 2004-2016

- Overview
  - Dataset of Harlequin ladybird (Harmonia axyridis) sightings in the UK from 2004–2016 (three records in 2003).
  - Primary sources: online recording via Harlequin Ladybird Survey, UK Ladybird Survey, and iRecord Ladybird app; plus inputs from coleopterists and data calls to local record centres and natural history societies.
  - Records include abundance, life stage (adult, larva, pupa, and occasionally eggs) and colour form (conspicua, spectabilis, succinea) when available.
- Data management and standardization
  - Data collated and stored in an Oracle database; records are not altered beyond standardized export for the dataset.
  - Quality control checks applied (see Quality control section) to ensure validity before export.
- Data content and variables
  - Each record represents a sighting of one or more individuals; abundance and life stage/colour form may be partial.
  - Location data provided as:
    - Grid references (OSGB for Britain, OSI for Ireland, truncated MGRS for Channel Islands) and as latitude/longitude (WGS84).
    - Grid references at full precision, plus 1km and 10km grid squares with corresponding lat/long.
  - Temporal data:
    - Start and end dates (usually the same date when full date is available); if only month/year or year are provided, intervals span the entire month or year.
  - Spatial metadata:
    - Precision of grid reference; vice county code (British and Irish vice counties); 1km and 10km grid centroids provided as needed.
  - Other fields:
    - Abundance (text; may be a single value, range, or qualitative like “a couple”).
    - Form_abundance, Form (colour form), Stage_abundance, Stage.
    - RECORDER field (recorder ID standardized as surname plus initials; one ID may refer to multiple individuals; a person may have multiple IDs).
- Data structure details
  - Key columns include STARTDATE, ENDDATE, GRIDREF, PRECISION, VC (Watsonian vice county), LATITUDE/LONGITUDE (and 1km/10km variants), GR_1KM/LATITUDE_1KM/LONGITUDE_1KM, GR_10KM/LATITUDE_10KM/LONGITUDE_10KM, ABUNDANCE, FORM_ABUNDANCE, FORM, STAGE_ABUNDANCE, STAGE, RECORDER.
- Quality control
  - Validation checks: grid references must map to land; dates must be valid (no future dates).
  - Records are verified by Coccinellidae experts, via photo/specimen verification or by reliance on known expert recorder.
- Recording bias and limitations
  - Potential spatial bias toward urban areas due to citizen-science nature.
  - Temporal bias with spikes during periods of intensive media activity around the Ladybird Survey.
- Access and implications for data leaders
  - Organized for discoverability and re-use within an Oracle-based system; export provides standardized values for analysis.
  - Useful for tracking invasion dynamics, identifying data gaps (e.g., records lacking abundance or life stage), and informing data governance, metadata standards, and cross-source coordination.
  - Highlights need to account for recorder ambiguity and variable data completeness when integrating with other datasets.
