# Additional notes and changes to the plot location and sampling information in Marrs et. al . 1986

- Purpose of notes
  - Provide precise relocation and repeatable ordering details for sampling locations to support accurate future measurement and re-analysis.

- Knock Fell (Agrostis-Festuca Grassland, D31)
  - Plots: Exclosure and grazed plot
  - Transects: 3 m spacing; 3 m between frames along each transect; pin frame location straddles the transect line.
  - Exclosure: Not a perfect square; the plot inside is. Transects marked with wooden stakes; start at south end; stakes located 2 m outside first frame position; proximity to fences specified (e.g., 1 m from south fence; various distances to West/East/North fences).
  - Grazed plot: Located south of the enclosure; split into two sections (Frames 1–6 and Frames 7–10); Transects 9 and 10 not recorded due to route of the Pennine Way and trampling; marker posts replaced with Permablocks (2 m outside ends of sections).
  - Specific marker notes: For Grazed Transect 1 and Transect 8, details provided for Permablocks relative to frames 6 and 10, and frame positions; includes distances and magnetic bearings for relocation.

- Hard Hill (Festuca Grassland, D40)
  - Plots: Exclosure and grazed plot
  - Marker changes: Grazed plot marker posts replaced with Permablock markers; northwest marker distance from exclosure post given; markers are 27 m apart north–south, and 27 m apart west–east between corresponding ends.
  - Frame layout: Transects numbered east to west; frames 1–10 run north to south; pins straddle transect lines.
  - Relocation aids: Note on locating permablocks with a metal detector when vegetation covers markers.

- Little Dun Fell (Festuca Grassland, D42)
  - Within exclosure: Original fence line preserved; measurements from fence line; transect ends marked with posts 2 m outside frame positions; frame positions every 3 m; total length 31 m.
  - Grazed plot: Located south of exclosure; marker posts replaced with Permablocks at different positions than in exclosure; transects run south to north in this plot; 2 m outside of frame 1 position and 2 m outside of frame 10 position; distance between transect blocks ~27 m.
  - Direction: General bearing Mag 332° for the sampling direction.

- Silverband (Eriophoretum, D34)
  - Plots: Exclosure and grazed plots; both have 5 transects and 10 frame positions per transect (total 500 pin positions).
  - Exclosure: Posts 2 m outside frame 1 and 1 m outside frame 10; start/end coordinates relative to fences provided.
  - Grazed plot: Stakes driven into peat; grazed stakes placed differently from exclosure; transects run SE to NW; 2 m outside frame 1 and 10; end-to-end distance between corresponding ends noted; marker posts may be located by metal detector if obscured.

- Troutbeck Head (Eriophoretum, D30)
  - Plots: Exclosure and grazed plot; each has 5 transects with 10 frame positions (total 500 pins).
  - Orientation: Exclosure roughly rectangular and slightly downhill West–East; grazed plot offset by 2–3 m to the North and West; frames straddle transect lines.
  - Exclosure: Start of transect 1 near West fence; end of transect 10 2 m outside frame 10.
  - Grazed: Transects West–East with two-meter gaps between transects; frame positions offset similarly from marker posts; perspective maintained for relocation.

- Bog Hill (Calluna-Eriophoretum, D26)
  - Plots: Exclosure and grazed plot; 7 transects; paired 1 m × 1 m quadrats A and B on each side of transect; transects 9 m long; 126 quadrats total; 400 pin positions recorded in each survey (5 frame positions per quadrat, with two randomly allocated pin locations per position; 10 pins per quadrat).
  - Quadrats: 40 quadrats repeatedly resurveyed in each block; recording scheme specifies which quadrats (A/B) and which transects/locations are sampled.
  - Frame positions: Five set frame positions per quadrat, with two pins per frame position.

- Cottage Hill (J1, Juncus Squarrosus Grassland, D20)
  - Plots: Exclosure and grazed plot; each with 10 transects and 10 frame positions (1000 pin positions total).
  - Orientation: Exclosure oriented SE to NW; ungrazed plot adjacent to the enclosure along the NE slope; transects run in the same frame spacing as the enclosure.
  - Frame and frame locations: Frames start 1 m from marker posts and then at 2 m intervals; the pin frame location straddles the transect line.

- River Tees (N1, Nardus Stricta Grassland, D33)
  - Plots: Exclosure and grazed plot; each with 10 transects and 10 frame positions (1000 pin positions total).
  - Exclosure: End of each transect marked by posts running North–South; frame 10 furthest from the river; first frame position 0.5 m from North post; subsequent frames every 1.5 m.
  - Grazed plot: Divided into three sections; transects run East–West with three sections oriented progressively further from the exclosure; numbering runs from East to West adjacent to the river upstream; marker posts at ends of transects maintain 2 m gaps between ends.

- Moss Burn (Johnny's Flush, D44)
  - Plots: Exclosure and grazed plot; 10 transects; 6 frame positions; 5 points per frame per quadrat (total 300 pin positions).
  - Layout: Recording plots arranged as 1 m × 1 m quadrats A to J along the long axis (East to West) and 1 to 6 along the short axis (upslope).
  - Frame placement: Across the quadrat at 45 cm from the base; pins recorded at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 with replicates 1–5.
  - Fence notes: Grazed plot lies 2 m upslope of fence line; marker corners still defined; trap notes on open fence lines retained.

- General data management notes across sites
  - Emphasis on exact relocation through described mark placements (posts, Permablocks, bearings) and clear frame/transact orientation to ensure repeatability.
  - Some transects and marker positions were altered due to external factors (e.g., Pennine Way routing) or vegetation overgrowth; these changes are explicitly documented to preserve interpretability of longitudinal data.
  - Where markers are obscured, guidance is provided for locating markers (e.g., metal detectors for Permablocks).
  - Across plots, frame locations typically straddle transects; frame numbering directions vary by plot, with explicit notes on orientation to avoid misalignment in future analyses.
  - Total pin positions per site are provided to aid reproducibility and datasets’ dimensionality checks (e.g., 500, 1000, 300 pin positions).
