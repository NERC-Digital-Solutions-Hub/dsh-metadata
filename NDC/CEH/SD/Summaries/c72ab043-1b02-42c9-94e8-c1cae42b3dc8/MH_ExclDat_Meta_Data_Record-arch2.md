# Long-term vegetation response to removal of sheep grazing at Moor House National Nature Reserve

## Purpose and Context
- Evaluates the impact of removing sheep grazing on vegetation across upland Britain using long-standing monitoring plots.
- Nine grazing exclosures (1953–1972) have an adjacent grazed plot for each to isolate effects of grazing removal from other influences.
- Sites span elevations 550–830 m and include diverse vegetation types: Nardus grassland, Agrostis-Festuca grassland, Festuca grassland, Calluna–Eriophorum bog, Eriophorum bog, eroding bog, and base-rich flush.
- The study’s design supports comparisons over time to infer grazing effects while accounting for non-grazing drivers.

## Study Design and Sites
- Lineage consists of nine plot pairs: each pair has one exclosure and one adjacent grazed plot.
- Detailed site information provided for each pair, including:
  - Location coordinates
  - Altitude
  - Year established (ranging from 1953 to 1972)
  - Vegetation type
  - Number of recording occasions (Times recorded: between 4 and 9 per plot)
- Example sites include Knock Fell, Hard Hill Ridge, Little Dun Fell, Silverband, Troutbeck Head, Bog Hill, Cottage Hill, River Tees, and Moss Burn.

## Methods and Data
- Monitoring conducted at irregular intervals throughout the experimental period.
- Data collection using the pin frame method; plot sizes vary, resulting in different numbers of quadrats per plot.
- The nine exclosures and adjacent grazed plots are designed to capture vegetation change due to grazing removal, while neighboring plots help control for other temporal factors.
- Management and monitoring history:
  - Exclosures established and maintained by Natural England (and predecessor bodies)
  - Monitoring since 1982 conducted by the Environmental Change Network (ECN) via the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH)

## Outputs and Documentation
- Primary outputs are long-term vegetation change assessments across upland habitats, facilitating interpretation of grazing removal effects.
- Supporting documentation includes detailed plot-level recording histories (varying quadrat counts and sizes) for transparency and reproducibility.

## Related Literature
- A broad set of related papers spanning 1960s–2018, covering vegetation surveys, grazing effects on soils and vegetation, and rewilding implications. Examples include:

## Data Access and Use
- Aims to increase data value by integrating these monitoring datasets with other relevant data sources.
- Emphasizes making underlying data behind final outputs accessible to others.
- Datasets are stored and managed through established environmental monitoring programs (NE/ECN/UKCEH) to support transparency and reuse.
