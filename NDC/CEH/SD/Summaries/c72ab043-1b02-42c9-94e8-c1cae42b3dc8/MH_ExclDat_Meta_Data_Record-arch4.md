# Abstract

- Long-standing vegetation monitoring at Moor House National Nature Reserve (North Pennines) to assess the impact of removing sheep grazing on upland vegetation.
- Nine grazing exclosures established between 1953 and 1972, each paired with an adjacent grazed plot observed in the same way and on the same schedule as the exclosure plot.
- This paired design allows changes due to grazing removal to be distinguished from other influences on vegetation.

## Study design and scope

- Purpose: Determine effects of sheep-grazing removal on a range of vegetation communities typical of upland Britain.
- Pair structure: each exclosure plot has a nearby grazed plot; both are monitored identically to separate grazing effects from other factors.
- Elevation range: 550–830 meters above sea level.
- Vegetation types represented: Nardus grassland, Agrostis-Festuca grassland, Festuca grassland, Calluna-Eriophorum blanket bog, Eriophorum bog, eroding bog, and base-rich flush.

## Sites, plots, and timing

- Nine plot pairs located across Moor House Reserve, with specific site details (location, altitude, vegetation type) provided for each.
- Establishment years of exclosures span 1953–1967; plots have varying numbers of recording events (between 4 and 9 times per plot).
- Monitoring has occurred at irregular intervals; plot sizes differ, leading to different numbers of quadrats per plot.
- Monitoring method: pin frame technique; detailed per-plot information and quadrat counts are available in the supporting documentation.
- Lineage: a structured record of each plot’s location, altitude, establishment year, vegetation type, and recording frequency.

## Data governance and stewardship

- Maintained by Natural England (NE) and predecessor bodies; since 1982 monitored by the Environmental Change Network (ECN) through the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH).
- The dataset is supported by extensive literature, including multiple related papers on vegetation responses, soil chemistry, and rewilding implications.
