# Abstract:

- Purpose: Long-standing monitoring plots at Moor House National Nature Reserve (North Pennines) to determine the impact of removing sheep grazing on various upland vegetation communities.
- Experimental design: Nine grazing exclosures (paired with adjacent grazed plots) established between 1953 and 1972 to separate grazing removal effects from other influences on vegetation.
- Rationale: Adjacent grazed plots run in parallel to exclosures to account for changes not due to grazing removal.
- Study area and vegetation: Exclosures located at elevations between 550 m and 830 m; vegetation types include Nardus grassland, Agrostis-Festuca grassland, Festuca grassland, Calluna-Eriophorum blanket bog, Eriophorum bog, eroding bog, and base-rich flush.
- Oversight and monitoring: Plots set up and maintained by Natural England (and predecessors); since 1982 monitored by the Environmental Change Network (ECN) through the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH).
- Data collection and provenance: Monitoring conducted via the pin frame method at irregular intervals; plot sizes vary, leading to different numbers of quadrats recorded; detailed plot-specific data are provided in supporting documentation.
- Related research: Cited several historical and contemporary studies on vegetation, soils, and grazing effects at Moor House (list of papers provided).
- Lineage and plot details: Each of the nine plots has explicit location, altitude, vegetation type, establishment year, and the number of times recordings have occurred (ranging from 4 to 9 times per plot). Plots include Knock Fell, Hard Hill Ridge, Little Dun Fell, Silverband, Troutbeck Head, Bog Hill, Cottage Hill, River Tees, and Moss Burn.
- Data accessibility: Additional methodological and supporting information available in accompanying documentation.
