# Long-term vegetation monitoring data for the Moor House, exclosure and grazing plots, 1953-2016

## Overview
- Long-running study at Moor House National Nature Reserve investigating effects of removing sheep grazing on upland vegetation.
- Nine plots with paired exclosure (fenced) and grazed (unfenced) areas; permanent fences mark exclosures.
- Data collected irregularly from 1955 to 2016 to track vegetation changes over time.

## Experimental design
- Each plot contains paired areas: fenced exclosure and adjacent unfenced, permanently marked and open to grazing.
- Fences maintained; grazed plots allow free-ranging sheep.
- Study inception in 1953 with subsequent plot additions; nine total plots.

## Sampling and data collection methods
- Vegetation recorded with a 1 m pin frame containing 10 pins spaced at 10 cm.
- Pins dropped through frame to soil surface; species touches counted within height strata.
- Four height strata for vascular plants: >30 cm (1), 20–30 cm (2), 10–20 cm (3), 0–10 cm (4). Strata code 99 = unstratified.
- Bryophytes, lichens, and non-plant features (rock, litter, bare soil, peat, open water, etc.) recorded as unstratified (99); touches counted as 1 if present.
- Data include absolute counts (number of pin touches per species per strata) and presence/absence data (unstratified) for certain groups.
- Method and sampling point numbers vary by plot and year (e.g., some years have reduced points, bryophyte recording changes, etc.).

## Fieldwork and instrumentation
- Permanent fences indicate exclosure plots; smaller markers mark grazed plot extents.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Site, Plot (enclosed or grazed), Year (1955–2016), Transect (1–10 or 1A–7B), Quadrat (1–10 or site-specific), Frame (Bog Hill only), Pin (position along frame).
- Strata (1–4; 99 for unstratified) and Score (number of pin touches for vascular plants; 1 for all non-vascular data and unstratified vascular data).
- Species number: VESPAN code; Species name updated to current nomenclature where applicable.

## Data structure and metadata
- Nine sites: Knock Fell, Trout Beck Head, Hard Hill, River Tees, Silver Band, Cottage Hill, Little Dun Fell, Moss Burn, Bog Hill.
- Data dimensions include plot type (enclosed vs grazed), year, transect, quadrat, frame (where applicable), and pin-level observations.
- Species identifications tied to ECN database codes; early surveys updated to current nomenclature.

## Quality control
- Each survey conducted by experienced botanical surveyors in pairs, using identical methods and equipment.

## Miscellaneous supporting documents and notes
- Key references: Marrs et al. (1986) guide to recording methods; Adamson & Kahl (2001) vegetation changes in Moor House exclosure plots.
- Additional documents: ECN database references; project website (www.ecn.ac.uk).
- Detailed per-site, per-year notes covering sampling dates, stratification status, number of points, bryophyte recording, and any data substitutions or losses (e.g., 1976 enclosed transect 1 data lost; Moss Burn 2016 note about opening the enclosed plot to grazing).

## Data coverage and caveats
- Years and methods vary by site; substantial heterogeneity in sampling intensity and stratification across time.
- Not all years have bryophyte recording or stratified data; some sites show partial data (e.g., Bog Hill frame usage, transect changes).
- Some data gaps and losses are noted (e.g., certain years with missing transects or data losses; 2016 note for Moss Burn about changed grazing status).
- Species nomenclature linked to ECN; older records may require reconciliation with current taxonomic standards.

## How to use and interpret
- Suitable for long-term trend analysis of vegetation responses to grazing exclusion across multiple upland vegetation types.
- Data can support cross-site comparisons of vascular plant height distributions and bryophyte/lichen presence patterns.
- Users should account for year-by-year methodological changes, missing data, and site-specific recording practices when aggregating or comparing across years or plots.
- Potential data products include time-series dashboards of vegetation height structure, presence/absence trends for bryophytes and lichens, and exclosure vs grazed comparisons.
