# Plot layout at Little Dun Fell

- Overview
  - This document presents the layout and sampling framework for environmental monitoring plots across multiple sites, to support consistent data collection, analysis, and visualization of environmental health over time.
  - It covers plot designs for different habitats and experimental setups, with emphasis on standardised layouts and transect/quadrat schemes.

- Site and plot layouts
  - Little Dun Fell: plot layout described (overall sampling framework for the site).
  - Troutbeckhead: plot layout described (supporting consistent sampling across the site).
  - Hill: layout of the Hill study (not to scale), including an east-of-hill tree enclosure edge bog; details on the bog and enclosure contexts.
  - Juncus squarrosus grassland (Jl): layout of the experimental plots; subdivision into a grid structure for sampling.
  - Hill grazed enclosed plots: description notes forty quadrats chosen randomly within the enclosure.
  - Enclosures and markers: presence of marker posts and enclosure boundaries to inform plot positioning.
  - Plot and quadrat grid: the 10 × 6 plots are identified by corner posts and gridded into quadrats; sampling follows this grid layout across the depicted areas.

- Sampling design and procedures
  - Quadrats: random selection of quadrats within specific plots (e.g., 40 quadrats in Hill grazed enclosed plots).
  - Transects: for certain habitats (e.g., Jl grassland), layouts include subdivision into 10 transects, each with 10 frame positions for point quadrat studies.
  - Grid-based sampling: plots are organized in a defined grid (10 × 6) to standardize spatial coverage and comparability across sites.

- Data handling and outputs
  - Data are intended to be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed using standardised methods.
  - Outputs are presented in clear formats such as reports, maps, and charts to support environmental health assessment and policy performance evaluation.
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to the appropriate portals to enable ongoing access and reuse.

- Key challenges and aims for analysts
  - Increasing the value of monitoring datasets by integrating them with other relevant data sources (moving beyond single-use applications).
  - Enabling others to access the underlying data used to generate final outputs, supporting transparency and broader analysis.
