# Long-term vegetation monitoring data for the Moor House, exclosure and grazing plots, 1953-2016

## Overview
- Long-running study at Moor House National Nature Reserve examining effects of removing sheep grazing on upland vegetation across nine plots.
- Experimental design includes paired fenced (exclosure) and unfenced (grazed) plots to compare grazing effects.
- Data span from 1953 to 2016 with irregular survey intervals and varying plot layouts.

## Experimental design and study scope
- Nine plots established with permanent fences marking exclosures and adjacent grazed plots available for free-ranging grazing.
- Plot sizes and shapes differ between vegetation types, requiring bespoke survey approaches.
- Purpose is to track vegetation change over time under contrasting grazing regimes and to understand long-term ecological responses.

## Sampling, field methods, and data captured
- Sampling tool: 1 m long pin frame with 10 pins spaced at 10 cm intervals, straddling a quadrat above vegetation.
- For each pin, vegetation touches are counted within four height strata:
  - 1 = >30 cm
  - 2 = 20–30 cm
  - 3 = 10–20 cm
  - 4 = 0–10 cm
  - 99 = unstratified (no height data)
- Recording rules:
  - For vascular plants: touches recorded within strata (1–13 touches per species per frame).
  - For non-vascular plants (bryophytes/lichens) and ground features (litter, bare soil, rock, etc.): unstratified (99) with a single touch (1) if present.
- Data types:
  - Absolute counts (touches) per species per strata (only vascular plants).
  - Presence/absence data for non-vascular plants and unstratified vascular data.
- Data collection notes:
  - Uneven sampling cadence and occasional methodological differences across years.
  - Some years involve reduced sampling points, bryophyte recording variations, or unstratified recording of certain taxa.
- Data structure details:
  - Fields include Site, Plot (enclosed/grazed), Year, Transect, Quadrat, Frame (where used), Pin, Strata, Score (number of touches or presence/absence baseline), Species number (ECN VESPAN code), Species name (updated to current nomenclature).
- Notable data collection elements:
  - Some sites have frame-position specifics (e.g., Bog Hill), while others have fixed frame locations.
  - Transects and quadrats are numbered, with occasional site-specific naming conventions (e.g., Bog Hill, Cottage Hill).

## Data structure and metadata
- Site-level list: Knock Fell, Trout Beck Head, Hard Hill, River Tees, Silver Band, Cottage Hill, Little Dun Fell, Moss Burn, Bog Hill.
- Plot status: enclosed (exclosure) or grazed.
- Temporal coverage: 1953–2016 (survey years vary by site).
- Data granularity:
  - Frame-level pin data across transects and quadrats.
  - Stratified (height-based) data for vascular plants; unstratified data for bryophytes, lichens, and ground substrates.
- Species information:
  - Species number (VESPAN code) linked to an updated species name.

## Quality control and provenance
- Each survey conducted by experienced botanical surveyors working in pairs.
- Consistent recording methods and equipment within surveys.
- Supporting documents and references:
  - Marrs, Rawes, Robinson, & Poppitt (1986): guide to recording methods and database.

## Data updates, limitations, and site-specific notes
- Moss Burn: 1972 data notes differences in pin positions and the inclusion of bryophytes; 2016 note indicates enclosed plot opened to grazing after 2013 to protect Saxifraga hirculus.
- Cottage Hill: multiple years with changes in frame usage, stratification, and data completeness; certain years include random quadrat selections or data losses (e.g., 1976 enclosed transect 1 data lost; 1981 enclosed data limitations).
- River Tees: longitudinal data with variations in stratified vs unstratified recording and some years with bryophyte recording inconsistencies.
- Bog Hill: data span 1971–2016 with consistent grazing/grazed vs enclosed treatments but with changes in point counts and stratification over time.
- Little Dun Fell: extensive year-to-year changes in stratification and frame configuration; notes indicate several transects stratified/unstratified depending on year.
- Knock Fell, Hard Hill, Trout Beck Head: long-running records with typical variations in year-by-year methodology and data points.
- Across sites, there are occasional notes about missing transects, frame positions, or data losses that affect comparability across years.

## Governance, stewardship considerations
- The dataset is a rich, long-term resource for detecting vegetation change under grazing vs exclosure treatments, but heterogeneity in methods over time necessitates careful metadata curation.
- Key stewardship needs:
  - Maintain detailed methodological metadata (year, site, transect, frame usage, stratification scheme, data completeness).
  - Preserve legacy coding (Strata, Score, Species number) while embracing updated nomenclature and taxonomic updates.
  - Document known data gaps, losses, and site-specific deviations to inform users of limitations and avoid misinterpretation.
  - Ensure clear data update procedures and versioning as methods or nomenclature evolve.
  - Facilitate data discovery through portal/catalogue indexing and cross-referencing with ECN metadata standards.

## Access and supporting materials
- Primary dataset: long-term pin-frame vegetation data (1953–2016) from Moor House exclosure and grazed plots.
- Supporting materials and references:
  - recording methods and database guide (Marrs et al. 1986)
  - vegetation change reports (Adamson & Kahl 2001)
  - ECN database and related resources (www.ecn.ac.uk)
- Documentation of data structure, site-specific notes, and historical survey practices is essential for accurate interpretation and reuse.
