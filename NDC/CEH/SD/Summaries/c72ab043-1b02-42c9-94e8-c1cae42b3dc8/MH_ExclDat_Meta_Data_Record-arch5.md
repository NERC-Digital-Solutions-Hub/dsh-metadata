# Moor House National Nature Reserve long-term vegetation monitoring plots: effects of removing sheep grazing

## Overview
- Long-standing monitoring to determine the impact of removing sheep grazing on upland vegetation.
- Nine grazing exclosures established between 1953 and 1972, each with an adjacent grazed plot monitored in parallel to control for non-grazing influences.
- Exclosures span vegetation types including Nardus-Festuca grassland, Festuca grasslands, Calluna-Eriophorum blanket bog, Eriophorum bog, eroding bog, and base-rich flush.
- Since 1982, monitoring has been conducted by the Environmental Change Network (ECN) through the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH), with Natural England (and predecessors) as primary custodians.

## Data lineage and provenance
- The experiment comprises nine plot pairs (one exclosure, one grazed plot) across Moor House Reserve, with detailed plot-level metadata.
- Monitoring history and recording frequency are provided for each plot (times recorded per plot ranging from 4 to 9).
- Lineage details include specific plot names, locations, altitudes, establishment years, vegetation types, and recording counts.

## Location, design, and measurement
- Plot locations and elevations:
  - Knock Fell, 750 m; Agrostis-Festuca grassland; established 1955; times recorded: 9
  - Hard Hill Ridge, 690 m; Festuca grassland; established 1954; times recorded: 7
  - Little Dun Fell, 830 m; Festuca grassland; established 1954; times recorded: 8
  - Silverband, 690 m; Eriophorum bog; established 1966; times recorded: 7
  - Troutbeck Head, 690 m; Eriophorum bog; established 1966; times recorded: 7
  - Bog Hill, 550 m; Calluna-Eriophorum bog; established 1953; times recorded: 4
  - Cottage Hill, 550 m; Juncus squarrosus grassland; established 1967; times recorded: 8
  - River Tees, 550 m; Nardus stricta grassland; established 1967; times recorded: 8
  - Moss Burn, 640 m; Calcareous flush; established 1972; times recorded: 5
- Monitoring method: pin frame measurements conducted at irregular intervals; plot sizes vary, resulting in different numbers of quadrats recorded.
- Data collection emphasizes parallel grazing vs exclosure design to isolate effects of grazing removal.

## Data governance and stewardship
- Custodians: Natural England and predecessor bodies; Environmental Change Network (ECN) via UKCEH since 1982.
- Supporting documentation is available, and related publications are cited for context and provenance.
- The dataset comprises long-term observational data with detailed provenance, enabling future reuse and re-analysis.

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations
- Irregular recording intervals and varying plot sizes may affect comparability across plots and time.
- Older datasets may require bespoke handling or harmonization due to non-uniform methods and formats.
- Metadata quality relies on the comprehensiveness of the supporting documentation referenced.

## Usage context and related materials
- The data are used to assess the effects of removing sheep grazing on multiple upland vegetation types, with exclosure and grazed plots providing a natural control.
- Related papers spanning from 1960s to 2018 offer context on vegetation responses, soil chemistry, and ecosystem impacts of grazing removal.

## Recommendations for stewardship and future reuse
- Preserve and document all provenance details: plot-level coordinates, altitudes, vegetation types, establishment years, and recording histories.
- Maintain the pin frame measurement methodology records and ensure clear metadata about plot sizes and sampling effort.
- Facilitate access to supporting documentation and related publications to aid interpretation and re-analysis.
- Consider harmonizing metadata standards across plots to improve cross-plot comparability for future analyses.
