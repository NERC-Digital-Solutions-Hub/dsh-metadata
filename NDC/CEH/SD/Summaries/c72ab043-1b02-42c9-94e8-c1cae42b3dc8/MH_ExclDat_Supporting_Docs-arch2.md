# Long-term vegetation monitoring data for the Moor House, exclosure and grazing plots, 1953-2016

## Aim and scope
- Long-term dataset documenting the effect of eliminating sheep grazing on upland vegetation at Moor House National Nature Reserve.
- Nine plots established from 1953 onward, each with paired enclosed (exclosure) and grazed areas.
- Data collected irregularly over decades to enable assessment of vegetation change and policy/management impacts.

## Experimental design
- Nine plots comprising paired areas: fenced exclosures adjacent to grazed, permanently marked, open plots.
- Permanent fences maintained; adjacent plots remain accessible to free-ranging sheep.
- Plot layout and transect orientation varied between sites and over time.

## Data collection methods
- Sampling via a 1-meter pin frame with 10 pins spaced every 10 cm, set on supporting rods to span a quadrat.
- For each vascular plant species, number of touches in each height strata is recorded; bryophytes, lichens, and ground substrates are recorded as unstratified presence/absence data.
- Height strata (for vascular plants only): >30 cm; 20–30 cm; 10–20 cm; 0–10 cm. Unstratified coded as 99.
- Data collected in two main formats: absolute counts (touches in strata) and presence/absence (for non-vascular plants and substrates).
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced botanists in pairs; equipment and methods kept consistent within survey periods where possible, but some years show methodological variations.

## Data structure and terminology
- Data fields include:
  - Site (e.g., Knock Fell, Trout Beck Head, Hard Hill, River Tees, Silver Band, Cottage Hill, Little Dun Fell, Moss Burn, Bog Hill)
  - Plot (enclosed or grazed)
  - Year (1955–2016)
  - Transect (1–10; Bog Hill uses 1A–7A and 1B–7B)
  - Quadrat (1–10; Bog Hill 1–9, Moss Burn 1–6)
  - Frame (used only at Bog Hill; positions 1–5)
  - Pin (position along the frame)
  - Strata (1–4 for vascular plants; 99 for unstratified)
  - Score (number of pin touches per species; 1–13 for vascular; 1 for non-vascular)
  - Species number (VESPAN code)
  - Species name (updated to current nomenclature)
- Two recording methods used: absolute counts by strata or presence/absence without stratification (depending on date and plot).

## Species data and provenance
- Vascular plant data recorded with stratified counts (where applicable) and unstratified counts; bryophytes/lichens and ground substrates recorded as unstratified presence/absence.
- Species codes correspond to the Environmental Change Network (ECN) database (VESPAN numbers); species names updated over time.

## Site overview and recording timeline
- Sites include: Knock Fell, Trout Beck Head, Hard Hill, River Tees, Silver Band, Cottage Hill, Little Dun Fell, Moss Burn, Bog Hill.
- Recording years span from mid-1950s to 2016, with varying sampling intensity and methods.
- Some sites include frame-based data (Bog Hill only); other sites use fixed transect locations without a frame.

## Data quality control and variability
- Each survey conducted by experienced botanists, using standardized methods within periods.
- There are notable inconsistencies across years and sites:
  - Irregular sampling intervals and varying data density.
  - Differences in whether bryophytes were recorded, stratified vs unstratified approaches, and numbers of sampling points.
  - Some years show reduced or altered sampling (e.g., 1970 stratified vs unstratified transects; 1973 data with random quadrat selection; 1976 data loss for enclosed transect 1; 1981 lack of enclosed-frame data).
- Per-site notes indicate ongoing methodological evolution and occasional data gaps or losses, with specific examples:
  - Moss Burn: enclosed plot opened to grazing after 2013 (no ungrazed plot thereafter).
  - Cottage Hill: various years show changes in frame counts, stratification, and bryophyte recording; some data losses noted (e.g., 1976 enclosed transect 1 data lost; 1981 enclosed data gaps).
  - River Tees and other sites exhibit similar year-to-year variations and occasional incomplete data.

## Notable caveats for data users
- Data reflect a mix of methods and sampling intensities across decades; direct comparisons over time require careful harmonization for site- and year-specific differences.
- Several years include partial data, frame-based notes, and historic nomenclature updates; users should consult metadata and supporting documents for site-specific caveats and data provenance.
- The primary aim remains to assess vegetation response to grazing exclusion, with long-term trends interpreted in light of the evolving methodology and occasional data gaps.
