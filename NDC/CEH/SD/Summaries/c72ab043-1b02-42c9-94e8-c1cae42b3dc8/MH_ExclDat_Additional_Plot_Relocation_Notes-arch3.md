# Additional notes and changes to the plot location and sampling information in Marrs et. al . 1986

## Purpose
- Provides updated notes on plot location and sampling information to enable accurate relocation and repeatable ordering across surveys.

## Site-by-site sampling layout and relocation details

- Knock Fell (Agrostis-Festuca Grassland, D31)
  - Exclosure and grazed plots: transects 3 m apart; frames 3 m apart; pin frame location straddles transect line.
  - Exclosure: plot inside is approximately square; transects marked with wooden stakes; start/end positions described relative to fences.
  - Grazed plot: located south of exclosure; split into two sections (Frames 1–6; Frames 7–10); 9 and 10 not recorded due to Pennine Way routing and trampling.
  - Marker updates: marker posts replaced with Permablock markers; two blocks noted 2 m outside certain transects (see notes for Transtect 1 and 8).

- Hard Hill (Festuca Grassland, D40)
  - Marker posts initially used; grazed markers have been replaced with Permablock markers.
  - Exclosure and grazed plots: transects numbered east to west; frames 1–10 run north to south; frames are 1 m from marker lines and 3 m apart along transects; transects 2–10 described with precise distances to fences.
  - Endpoints: exclosure posts 2 m outside frame 1 and 1 m outside frame 10.

- Little Dun Fell (Festuca Grassland, D42)
  - Within exclosure: measurements from existing fence line; transects run north–south with posts at ends 2 m outside frame positions; frames at 3 m intervals (total length 31 m).
  - Grazed plot: orientation differs (frames run south to north); permablocks used 2 m outside transect ends; distance between front locations and start/end markers detailed (27 m between blocks).

- Silverband (Eriophoretum, D34)
  - Both plots: 5 transects each with 10 frame positions (500 pin positions total); markers differ between exclosure and grazed.
  - Exclosure: posts 2 m outside frame 1; 1 m outside frame 10; start/end positions relative to fences given.
  - Grazed: transect 5 marker post located 10.5 m SW of exclosure SW post; transects run SE to NW with 2 m gaps between start/end markers and frames; 22 m separation noted for transect 5 start relative to end of transect.

- Troutbeck Head (Eriophoretum, D30)
  - Both plots: 5 transects with 10 frame positions each (500 pin positions total); frames straddle transect lines.
  - Exclosure: transects 1 on north side; ends located near fence, with frames 1 m from markers and 3 m outside at ends; 2 m gaps between transects and 2 m between frames.
  - Grazed: same frame setup; ends marked with posts 1 m outside frame positions; transects run West to East; 2 m gaps between frames.

- Bog Hill (Calluna-Eriophoretum, D26)
  - 7 transects with paired 1 m × 1 m quadrats A and B on each side; 9 m quadrats long; 126 potential quadrats; 40 quadrats repeatedly resurveyed.
  - Recording area is larger than the recording plots; corner posts denote plots; transects spaced at 2 m; quadrats located at 1 m intervals from North to South.
  - Within each survey: same 40 quadrats are recorded; frame across quadrat with 5 frame positions (two randomly allocated) and two randomly allocated pin locations per frame position (total 400 pin positions).

- Cottage Hill (J1, Juncus Squarrosus Grassland, D20)
  - 10 transects × 10 frame positions (1000 pin positions total); frames recorded across all 10 points.
  - Orientation: SE to NW; transects 1 m apart; frames start 1 m from marker post and then at 2 m intervals.
  - Ungrazed plot adjacent to enclosure; relative start/end positions given to aid relocation; transect/frame orientation as above.

- River Tees (N1, Nardus Stricta Grassland, D33)
  - 10 transects × 10 frame positions (1000 pin positions total) for both plots.
  - Exclosure: end posts marked N–S; first frame position 0.5 m from North marker post; subsequent frames every 1.5 m.
  - Grazed: divided into three sections; transects run East to West (1–3, 4–6, 7–10); sections arranged from near to far exclosure with specific spacing and orientation described.
  - Frame locations straddle transect lines in both plots.

- Moss Burn (Johnny's Flush, D44)
  - 10 transects × 6 frame positions; 5 pin positions per frame; total 300 pin positions.
  - Plot layout: fenced exclosure with grazed plot 2 m upslope; plots arranged in a 1 m × 1 m quadrat grid labelled A–J along long axis (east–west) and 1–6 along short axis (upslope).
  - Frame placement: across quadrat at 45 cm from base; pins recorded at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (replicates 1–5).

## Marker conventions and frame setup
- Common approach across sites: frame location straddles the transect line; frames are positioned at fixed distances from marker posts or fence lines.
- Marker types: traditional wooden stakes in some plots; Permablock markers increasingly used to replace posts, with documented offsets (typically 2 m outside frame ends) for relocation.
- Orientation notes: transect and frame numbering may vary by site (e.g., Little Dun Fell frames run south to north in grazed plots versus north to south in exclosures); frame spacing generally 3 m or consistent with plot design; start/end offsets relative to fences or posts are explicitly provided.

## Notable changes and considerations for data use
- Some transects were shortened or not recorded in grazed plots due to nearby routes or trampling (e.g., Knock Fell Transects 9–10; Pennine Way impact).
- Marker updates (e.g., to Permablocks) require referencing alternate marker locations for relocation.
- In several sites, distances from exclosure boundary, fence lines, or corner posts are essential for accurate re-location of sampling points in follow-up surveys.
- Where orientation differs between exclosure and grazed plots, ensure correct frame-to-transect alignment during data collection and data fusion.

## Data interpretation implications for monitoring frameworks
- Precise relocation metadata is provided to support reproducibility and comparability across survey waves.
- The documentation highlights the need for robust metadata, including marker type, positional offsets, and transect/frame orientation, to overcome potential replication barriers.
- The structured detailing across multiple sites exemplifies how consistent spatial design and clear change logs facilitate ongoing environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
