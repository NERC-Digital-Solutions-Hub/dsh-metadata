# Moor House National Nature Reserve exclosures: long-term vegetation monitoring of removal of sheep grazing

- Purpose and design
  - Nine grazing exclosures (paired with adjacent grazed plots) established between 1953 and 1972 to assess the impact of removing sheep grazing on upland vegetation.
  - Adjacent grazed plots monitored simultaneously to account for vegetation changes driven by factors other than grazing removal.
  - Exclosures span elevations from 550 m to 830 m above sea level and cover diverse vegetation types representative of upland Britain.

- Monitoring history and management
  - Monitoring historically conducted by Natural England (and its predecessor bodies); since 1982, monitored by the Environmental Change Network (ECN) via the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH).

- Data collection and measurement
  - Monitoring conducted at irregular intervals using the pin frame method.
  - Plot sizes vary between sites, resulting in different numbers of quadrats recorded.
  - Detailed plot dimensions and the exact number of quadrats per plot are provided in the supporting documentation.

- Analytical potential
  - The paired exclosure–grazed design enables attribution of vegetation changes to grazing removal while controlling for non-grazing influences.
  - Long-term data across multiple vegetation types and altitudes support analyses of species composition shifts, productivity, and soil-vegetation interactions over time.
  - Data can be used to compare responses across sites with differing establishment years and environmental contexts.

- Related literature and context
  - Numerous related studies on vegetation changes, soil chemistry, and ecosystem impacts of grazing/removal, including works by Eddy et al., Marrs et al., and Rawes & Welch, spanning 1960s–2010s.
  - Indicates a broader research focus on upland vegetation responses to changes in grazing management and potential rewilding implications.

- Data access and provenance
  - Data originate from Moor House National Nature Reserve and are maintained by Natural England and UKCEH via ECN.
  - Supporting documentation includes site-specific details (location, altitude, year enclosed, vegetation type, recording frequency, and plot specifics), facilitating reproducibility and integration with other datasets.
