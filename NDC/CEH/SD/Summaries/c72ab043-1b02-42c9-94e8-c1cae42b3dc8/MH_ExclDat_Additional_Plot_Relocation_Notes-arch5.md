# Additional notes and changes to the plot location and sampling information in Marrs et. al . 1986.

## Overview
- Provides updated notes to enable accurate relocation and repeatable ordering of sampling locations across multiple plots.
- Documents plot-specific details on transects, frame positions, marker types, orientations, and distances from fixed features.
- Notes changes since earlier surveys (e.g., marker replacements, transect reductions due to trampling, and alignment with surrounding features).

## Data governance implications for Data Stewards
- Metadata should capture: plot name, plot type (exclosure vs grazed), number of transects, frame spacing, frame positions, total pin positions, and orientation.
- Location data relies on relative references (fences, corner posts, marker lines, and bearings) rather than precise GPS coordinates; store descriptive locators, distances, and bearing angles (e.g., Mag bearing) to ensure reproducibility.
- Document any changes since previous surveys (e.g., transect reductions, marker replacements) and the rationale (e.g., Pennine Way routing, vegetation cover).
- Track marker types and positions (wooden stakes, Permablock markers; 2m outside frame ends; 1m outside endpoints) to support future relocation and data linking.
- Include notes on data quality and accessibility (e.g., markers detectable by metal detector, markers obscured by vegetation).

## Site-specific sampling locations and changes

- Knock Fell (Agrostis-Festuca Grassland, D31)
  - Exclosure and grazed plots each with transects 3 m apart; frames 3 m apart along each transect.
  - Exclosure is not a perfect square; plot within is.
  - Grazed plot located south of the enclosure; transects 1–8 recorded (9 and 10 affected by trampling).
  - Marker posts replaced by Permablock markers; markers located 2 m outside frame ends.
  - Specific stake positions and distances to fences are provided for transects and ends.

- Hard Hill (Festuca Grassland, D40)
  - Exclosure and grazed plots; marker posts on grazed plot replaced with Permablocks.
  - North-west marker for grazed plot located a defined distance from the exclosure’s south-west post; transects run north–south; frames placed at 1 m from marker lines with 3 m between frames.
  - Marker visibility may require a metal detector to locate buried Permablocks.

- Little Dun Fell (Festuca Grassland, D42)
  - Measurements from existing exclosure fence; transects run north–south within the exclosure; grazed plot oriented differently with frame numbers running south to north.
  - Marker posts located 2 m outside frame ends; 3 m frame intervals; detailed distances to fences provided.
  - Grazed transect starts marked relative to exclosure positions.

- Silverband (Eriophoretum, D34)
  - Both plots: 5 transects × 10 frame positions (500 pin positions total).
  - Exclosure and grazed plots use stakes; grazed stakes driven into peat (vs. wooden stakes in exclosure); marker strategy includes two marker types (stakes vs Permablocks) with specific start/end distances.
  - Transects oriented roughly South–North; frame straddles transect line; detailed start distances from exclosure corners provided.

- Troutbeck Head (Eriophoretum, D30)
  - Both plots: 5 transects × 10 frame positions (500 pin positions total).
  - Orientation: exclosure is slightly downhill West–East; grazed plot offset by ~2–3 m to the West/North.
  - Start/end marker positions relative to fences provided; frame locations straddle the transect line.

- Bog Hill (Calluna-Eriophoretum, D26)
  - 7 transects with 1 m × 1 m quadrats A and B on each side of transect (total 126 quadrats; 400 pin positions).
  - Recording protocol: within each survey, same 40 quadrats per block; 5 set frame positions per quadrat with two random pin locations per frame (10 pins per quadrat).
  - Quadrats and frame positions are enumerated; overall layout includes wide plot area with consistent transect spacing (2 m between transects and quadrats aligned East–West).

- Cottage Hill (J1, Juncus Squarrosus Grassland, D20)
  - 10 transects × 10 frame positions (1000 pin positions total).
  - Orientation: SE to NW; transects 1 m apart; frames start 1 m from marker posts, then at 2 m intervals.
  - Ungrazed plot adjacent to enclosure with consistent spacing and alignment; frames straddle transect line.

- River Tees (N1, Nardus Stricta Grassland, D33)
  - 10 transects × 10 frame positions (1000 pin positions total) for both plots.
  - Enclosed plot uses fixed end posts; in grazed plot, three sections with transects numbered E to W; frame positions start close to exclosure and run westward, with sections offset progressively eastward to westward alignment.
  - Frame positions straddle transect lines and maintain consistent 1–1.5 m spacing within sections.

- Moss Burn (Johnny's Flush, D44)
  - 10 transects × 6 frame positions (300 pin positions total).
  - Plot layout: 1 m × 1 m quadrats labeled A–J along the long axis (east to west) and 1–6 across the short axis (upslope).
  - Recording uses a 45 cm offset of the frame from quadrat base; pins recorded at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (replicates 1–5).
  - Fence line details and quadrat arrangement provide exact relocation cues; grazed plot located 2 m upslope of fenced plot.

## Data quality, reproducibility, and storage considerations
- Ensure consistent labeling of plots, transects, frames, and quadrats across datasets.
- Capture marker type changes (wooden posts to Permablocks) and their exact positions relative to frames for future relocation.
- Preserve orientation conventions (e.g., transects numbered east–west or north–south as specified) and note any reversals (e.g., Little Dun Fell frame numbering running south to north in grazed plot).
- Document any field changes (e.g., sections not recorded due to access constraints) and rationale (e.g., routing of surrounding paths).
- Where GPS coordinates are not provided, maintain comprehensive descriptive locators, distances to fixed features, and bearing references to support precise relocation.

## End notes
- The document emphasizes repeatable ordering and relocation accuracy for multi-site, multi-plot data, with explicit guidance on transect/frame layouts, marker conventions, and distance measurements to fixed field features.
