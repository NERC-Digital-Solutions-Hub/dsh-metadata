# Long-term vegetation monitoring data for the Moor House, exclosure and grazing plots, 1953-2016

## Overview
- Long-term dataset from Moor House National Nature Reserve examining the effect of sheep grazing by comparing fenced exclosures with adjacent grazed plots.
- Nine plots across multiple sites; permanent fences mark exclosures; unfenced plots are subject to free-ranging grazing.
- Data collected at irregular intervals from 1953 onward, spanning 1955–2016 in various sites and transects.

## Experimental design
- Aim: Investigate the effect of eliminating sheep grazing on upland vegetation types.
- Paired design within each plot: enclosed (exclosure) vs grazed area adjacent to it.
- Fences are permanent; grazed plots are open to sheep.
- Plot sizes and sampling regimes vary by vegetation type and site; transect orientation and frame location differ between sites.
- Data include both vascular and non-vascular plants, with adjustments in methodology over time.

## Sampling and data collection methods
- Data collected with a 1 m pin frame containing 10 pins spaced every 10 cm; pins drop through vegetation to soil surface.
- Height strata recorded for vascular plants: >30 cm (1), 20–30 cm (2), 10–20 cm (3), 0–10 cm (4). Unstratified (99) used when height is not recorded.
- For non-vascular plants (bryophytes), lichens, and ground substrates (litter, bare soil, rock, etc.): unstratified presence/absence (score 1) only.
- For vascular plants: two recording modes across years/plots
  - Absolute counts: number of pin touches per species per strata (1–13 touches).
  - Presence/absence per strata: used in some years/plots.
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced botanical surveyors in pairs with consistent methods and equipment.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Data fields include: Site, Plot, Year, Transect, Quadrat, Frame (Bog Hill only), Pin, Strata, Score, Species number (ECN VESPAN code), Species name.
- Strata codes: 1 (>30 cm), 2 (20–30 cm), 3 (10–20 cm), 4 (0–10 cm), 99 (unstratified).
- Score: number of pin touches for vascular plant in each strata; bryophytes/lichens and non-vascular data use presence/absence (score = 1).

## Data structure and site details
- Sites: Knock Fell, Trout Beck Head, Hard Hill, River Tees, Silver Band, Cottage Hill, Little Dun Fell, Moss Burn, Bog Hill.
- For each site, data include: whether the plot is enclosed or grazed, year of survey, and per-year sampling configuration (points per treatment, stratified vs unstratified, bryophyte recording).
- Frame usage is site-specific (e.g., Bog Hill uses frames 1–5; others use fixed frame locations).
- Data recorded in multiple formats with variations in sampling intensity and methodology over time.

## Data recording schemes by site (highlights)
- Knocks Fell, Hard Hill, Little Dun Fell, Trout Beck Head, River Tees, Moss Burn, Cottage Hill, Bog Hill, Silverband: numerous years with both grazed and enclosed treatments; point counts and stratification vary by year and site.
- Moss Burn (1972 onward): data include 10 pin positions in 1972 with 30 quadrats; note that 2016 data indicate the enclosed plot was opened to grazing after 2013 to protect Saxifraga hirculus, so there is no ungrazed plot currently.
- Cottage Hill: extensive 1967–2016 data with changes in transect numbers, frame usage, and bryophyte recording; some years with data gaps or methodological changes.
- River Tees and Bog Hill: long-running records with varying numbers of points per treatment and stratification across years; some years include random quadrat selections or partial data.
- Specific anomalies and notes: occasional data losses (e.g., 1976 enclosed transect 1 data lost), random quadrat selections (e.g., 1973 data at Cottage Hill), and years with unstratified vs stratified recording swaps.

## Quality control and data management
- Each survey conducted by experienced botanists in pairs, using consistent methods and equipment.
- Data provenance and metadata maintained to ensure discoverability and usability (datasets may be uploaded to portals with metadata).

## Notable data issues and gaps (considerations for analysis)
- Irregular sampling intervals and varying sampling intensity across sites and years.
- Methodological changes over time (stratified vs unstratified, presence/absence vs counts; vascular vs non-vascular recording).
- Site-specific anomalies: frame usage differences, transect changes, data losses, and occasional missing treatments (e.g., some years with no bryophyte recording).
- Moss Burn note: removal of ungrazed plot after 2013 affects long-term grazing vs exclosure comparisons for Saxifraga hirculus.
- Administrative and boundary details: frames and transects differ by site, requiring careful alignment of data for cross-site analyses.

## Potential uses
- Analyze long-term effects of grazing vs exclosure on vegetation structure by height strata, species presence/absence, and overall plant community composition.
- Model temporal trends in vascular plant height distributions and bryophyte/lichen occurrences across sites.
- Assess data quality, gaps, and harmonization needs for meta-analyses across Moor House plots.
