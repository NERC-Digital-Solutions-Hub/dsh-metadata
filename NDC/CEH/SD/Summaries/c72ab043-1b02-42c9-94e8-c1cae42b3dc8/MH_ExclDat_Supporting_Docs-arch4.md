# Long-term vegetation monitoring data for the Moor House, exclosure and grazing plots, 1953-2016.

## Overview
- Long-running study at Moor House National Nature Reserve comparing vegetated exclosures (grazed vs enclosed) across nine plots and multiple sites from 1953 to 2016.
- Uses paired fenced (exclosure) and unfenced (grazed) transects to assess effects of sheep grazing on upland vegetation.
- Data are collected with a standardized pin-frame method, recording vegetation height strata and plant touches, plus presence/absence for non-vascular organisms and ground features.
- The dataset supports analysis of long-term vegetation change, grazing impacts, and habitat responses across diverse upland vegetation types.

## Experimental design
- Nine plots established in 1953 (additional plots added later) to study the effect of eliminating sheep grazing on typical upland vegetation types.
- Each plot comprises paired areas: a fenced, exclosed block and a nearby unfenced area open to grazing.
- Permanent fences mark exclosures; unfenced plots are actively grazed by sheep.
- Plot layouts and transect/frame configurations vary between sites and over time.
- Recording methods and sampling points have evolved; some years used different numbers of sampling points or stratification approaches.

## Sampling and data collection methods
- Data collected at irregular intervals from 1953 to 2016.
- Pin-frame methodology:
  - 1 m frame with 10 pins spaced at 10 cm intervals (positions 1–10; some sites have frame numbers differing, e.g., Bog Hill frame 1–5).
  - Pins drop through frame to soil surface; vegetation touches counted per pin.
  - Four height strata for vascular plants: >30 cm, 20–30 cm, 10–20 cm, 0–10 cm.
  - 99 denotes unstratified (used for non-vascular plants like bryophytes/lichens and ground substrates).
  - For non-vascular plants and ground features: presence/absence recorded (score = 1 if present); for vascular plants, a score is the number of touches within each strata (1–13 touches typical).
- Data recorded include:
  - Strata (1–4 for vascular plants; 99 for unstratified)
  - Score (number of pin touches or presence/absence)
  - Species number (VESPAN code)
  - Species name (updated to current nomenclature)
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced botanists in pairs using consistent equipment and methods.

## Data structure and key variables
- Site: Knock Fell, Trout Beck Head, Hard Hill, River Tees, Silverband, Cottage Hill, Little Dun Fell, Moss Burn, Bog Hill.
- Plot: enclosed (exclosure) or grazed.
- Year: survey year (1955–2016, with gaps and irregular intervals).
- Transect: numbered sequences (1–10; Bog Hill uses 1A–7A and 1B–7B in some years).
- Quadrat: quadrat number along the transect (varies by site; e.g., Bog Hill 1–9, Moss Burn 1–6).
- Frame: frame position (used at Bog Hill; other sites have fixed frames).
- Pin: pin position along frame (1–10, corresponding to height strata).
- Strata: height category (1 >30 cm, 2 20–30 cm, 3 10–20 cm, 4 0–10 cm; 99 unstratified).
- Score: number of pin touches for vascular plants (1–13); 1 for non-vascular and unstratified ground substrates.
- Species number: VESPAN code (environmental change database identifier).
- Species name: current nomenclature for recorded species.
- Additional notes capture methodological variations, frame usage, and site-specific quirks.

## Temporal coverage and site-level details
- Knock Fell: recording from 1956 onward with variations over years; some years have 1,000 points per treatment; bryophytes recorded; stratified/unstratified mix over time.
- Hard Hill: data from mid-1950s to 2015; multiple years show both grazed and enclosed treatments; comprehensive stratified/unstratified data.
- Little Dun Fell: data across 1955–2016 with both grazed and enclosed transects; mixed stratification and bryophyte recording across years.
- Silverband: records from 1966–2015; typically 500 points per treatment; bryophytes recorded; stratified/unstratified data varies by year.
- Trout Beck Head: 1966–2014, with later years including Bryant presence data; stratified and unstratified points reported.
- Bog Hill: data from 1971–2016; notes on frame usage (frame positions), stratification, and data losses (e.g., 1976 enclosed transect 1 data lost; 1973 random quadrat sampling); bryophytes recorded.
- Cottage Hill: extensive series from 1967–2016; complex sampling patterns with varying points per treatment and occasional data gaps; bryophytes frequently recorded.
- River Tees: data from 1967 onward; multiple years with grazed/enclosed treatments; bryophytes presence recorded; some years show unstratified data or mixed stratification.
- Moss Burn: records from 1972–2016; detailed notes on pin positions (10 pins in 1972, 5 pins otherwise), bryophyte data, and a 2016 note about enclosure opening to grazing to protect Saxifraga hirculus; some years include random quadrats and data losses.

## Quality control and documentation
- Surveys conducted by experienced botanical surveyors in pairs, applying uniform recording protocols.
- Documentation links include:
  - Marrs, Rawes, Robinson, & Poppitt (1986): guide to recording methods and database.
  - Adamson & Kahl (2001): vegetation changes within Moor House exclosures (CEH project C00162).
  - ECN (Environmental Change Network) references and website.
- Data structure and metadata are designed to support long-term trend analysis, cross-site comparisons, and replication.

## Notable anomalies, gaps, and caveats
- Sampling variations: differing numbers of points per treatment across years and sites; frame usage and transect numbering differ by site.
- Data gaps and losses:
  - 1976 enclosed transect 1 data lost (Cottage Hill).
  - 1981 enclosed frame data missing; grazed-only alternate transects data missing (Cottage Hill).
  - 1973 data random selection noted for Cottage Hill; 1976 data loss and 1981 data gaps across several sites.
  - Moss Burn 2016: enclosed plot opened to grazing after 2013 to protect Saxifraga hirculus; no ungrazed plot after that.
- Some years include bryophyte presence as recorded, others do not; bryophyte data inclusion varies by site/year.
- Frame-specific notes (e.g., Bog Hill frame positions; some years use non-standard frame schemes).
- Mixed use of stratified vs unstratified data across years, requiring careful harmonization for cross-year analysis.

## Implications for data leadership and usage
- Rich, long-term, multi-site vegetation dataset suitable for grazing impact analysis, succession studies, and climate-related vegetation change within upland ecosystems.
- Useful for validating data completeness, understanding methodological evolution, and planning future data collection with standardized metadata to minimize cross-site inconsistencies.
- Requires careful handling of site- and year-level methodological differences, frame usage, and known data gaps when aggregating or performing meta-analyses.
