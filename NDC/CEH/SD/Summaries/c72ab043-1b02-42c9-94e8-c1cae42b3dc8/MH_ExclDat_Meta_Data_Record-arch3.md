Abstract: At Moor House National Nature Reserve in the North Pennines long standing monitoring plots exist which are being used to determine the impact of the removal of sheep grazing from a range of vegetation communities typical of upland Britain.

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring aimed at assessing effects of removing sheep grazing on upland vegetation.
- Nine grazing exclosures (1953–1972) paired with adjacent grazed plots to control for non-grazing influences.
- Exclosures span vegetation types from upland grasslands to blanket bogs; monitoring designed to separate grazing impacts from other factors.

## Study Design and Monitoring Framework
- Paired plot design: each exclosure has a neighboring grazed plot monitored identically to isolate grazing removal effects.
- Timeframe and consistency: plots established mid-20th century with ongoing monitoring through established networks.
- Governance and stewardship: monitoring originally by Natural England and predecessors; since 1982 monitored by the Environmental Change Network (ECN) via the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH).

## Data Collection and Monitoring Details
- Method: pin frame monitoring across plots of varying sizes, resulting in different numbers of quadrats per plot.
- Temporal coverage: irregular intervals throughout the experimental period.
- Supporting documentation: detailed plot sizes and quadrat counts are provided in accompanying materials.

## Data Access and Related Work
- Data lineage and background research linked to Moor House NNR include numerous long-term vegetation and soil studies (cited papers spanning 1960s–2010s) documenting the effects of grazing and its removal.
- Ongoing governance and data stewardship are centered on NE/ predecessor bodies and ECN via UKCEH, underscoring commitment to data integrity and continuity.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates a robust long-term monitoring framework using paired control and treatment plots to attribute vegetation changes to grazing removal.
- Highlights the importance of consistent methodology (pin frame) and clear documentation of site metadata (location, altitude, vegetation type, establishment date, recording frequency).
- Illustrates data continuity across agencies and the role of centralized networks (ECN/UKCEH) in sustaining environmental monitoring efforts.
