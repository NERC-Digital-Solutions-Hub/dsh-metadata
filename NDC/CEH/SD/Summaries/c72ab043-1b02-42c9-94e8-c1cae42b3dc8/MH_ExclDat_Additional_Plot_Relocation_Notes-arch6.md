# Additional notes and changes to the plot location and sampling information in Marrs et. al . 1986.

- Purpose of the notes
  - Provide relocation accuracy and repeatable ordering for sampling locations across multiple sites.
  - Document latest survey updates to plot layouts, marker systems, and transect/frame configurations to support data reuse and comparability.

- General methodological notes across sites
  - Transects are typically arranged with fixed spacing (commonly 3 meters apart) and frames positioned along each transect (often 1 meter from marker lines and at 3-meter frame intervals).
  - The pin frame location generally straddles the transect line.
  - Marker systems have been updated in several plots (e.g., switch from wooden marker posts to Permablock markers); where markers are obscured, metal detectors are recommended for location.
  - Exclosures and grazed plots are described separately, enabling direct comparison of enclosed vs. grazed conditions.
  - Some plots have undergone orientation or positional changes to accommodate path routes (e.g., Pennine Way) or to reduce trampling impact, with notes on which transects were retained or abandoned.

- Knock Fell (Agrostis-Festuca Grassland, D31)
  - Exclosure plots: 3 m between transects; frames 3 m apart along each transect; pin frame location straddles transect line; exclosure shape not a perfect square but the inner plot is.
  - Grazed plot: located south of exclosure; divided into frames 1–6 and 7–10; transects 1–8 recorded (9 and 10 affected by trampling); marker posts replaced with Permablock markers (2 m outside transect ends).
  - Specific positions described for transect starts/ends relative to fences and corner posts.

- Hard Hill (Festuca Grassland, D40)
  - Within exclosure: transects north–south with end/start markers approximately 3 m apart; marker posts 3 m apart at ends; grazed plot marker posts replaced by Permablocks.
  - Distances between north-west markers and other exclosure markers specified; transects numbered east to west; frames numbered 1–10 from north to south.
  - Differences noted in marker positioning (Permablocks vs posts) and orientation between exclosure and grazed plots; markers for grazed plot can be located with a metal detector if obscured.

- Little Dun Fell (Festuca Grassland, D42)
  - Within exclosure: fence line visible; transect ends marked by posts 2 m outside frame positions; frames run north to south (frame 1 near start marker; 10 near end marker); slight slope across transects.
  - Grazed plot: positioned south of the exclosure; marker posts replaced with Permablocks at positions offset from the exclosure; transects run south to north in grazed plot (frame numbers east/west orientation differs from exclosure).
  - Distances provided from fence lines and end markers; transect spacing 3 m.

- Silverband (Eriophoretum, D34)
  - Both plots: 5 transects each with 10 frame positions; 500 pin positions total.
  - Exclosure: posts 2 m outside frame 1 and 1 m outside frame 10; start/end distances from fences specified.
  - Grazed plot: ends/markers described relative to exclosure; transects run SE to NW; marker positions offset from original exclosure posts; all frame positions still recorded.

- Troutbeck Head (Eriophoretum, D30)
  - Both plots: 5 transects × 10 frame positions; 500 pin positions total.
  - Exclosure: transects run north–south with end markers near fences; gaps between transects and frames specified.
  - Grazed plot: transects run west–east; marker posts offset from exclosure positions; frame positions 1 m from posts; 2 m gaps between frames.

- Bog Hill (Calluna-Eriophoretum, D26)
  - Both plots: 7 transects with paired 1 m × 1 m quadrats (A and B) on each side of transect; quadrats 9 m long with 10 points per quadrat; 400 pin positions per survey.
  - Plot extent: fenced area larger than recording plot; recording plots parallel to nearby plantation; corner posts 16 m apart (west–east) and 11 m apart (north–south) along fence.
  - Quadrats and sampling plan: 126 potential quadrats (7 transects × 2 sides × 9 positions); 40 quadrats consistently recorded per survey; frame positions 1–5 across quadrats, with two randomly allocated pin locations at each frame position (total 10 pins per quadrat).

- Cottage Hill (J1, Juncus Squarrosus Grassland, D20)
  - Both plots: 10 transects × 10 frame positions; all 10 frame points recorded (1000 pin positions total).
  - Orientation: plots oriented SE to NW; frames run SE to NW with 1 m between transects and 1 m offset from marker posts; frames start 1 m from marker posts and then at 2 m intervals.
  - Ungrazed plot adjacent to enclosure along slope; corresponding positional relationships with enclosure described (distances between corresponding transects/posts).

- River Tees (N1, Nardus Stricta Grassland, D33)
  - Both plots: 10 transects × 10 frame positions; 1000 pin positions total.
  - Exclosure: end markers run north–south; first frame 0.5 m from North marker, subsequent frames every 1.5 m.
  - Grazed plot: divided into three sections; transects run east–west with numbering from east to west; each section’s relative positions to exclosure described (section starts/ends offset by tens of meters); pin frame location straddles transect line.

- Moss Burn (Johnny's Flush, D44)
  - Both plots: 10 transects × 6 frame positions; 5 frame positions recorded per quadrat, yielding 300 pin positions.
  - Plot layout: exclosure fence remains; grazed plot located 2 m upslope; recording plots divided into 1 m × 1 m quadrats labeled A to J along long axis; quadrats A–J across short axis; pin frame placed across quadrat at 45 cm from base; pins at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 correspond to replicates 1–5.

- Data recording and placement notes across sites
  - The frame locations and transect spacing are consistently designed to support relocation and matching across surveys.
  - Marker replacement (posts to Permablocks) is a recurring update to improve durability and visibility; locating markers may require metal detectors where vegetation occludes markers.
  - In several plots, transects or sections were shortened or reoriented to reduce trampling or due to path routing (e.g., Pennine Way influence).
  - Detailed spatial relationships to fences, corners, posts, and exclosure boundaries are provided to enable precise re-construction of plotting schemes for future data collection.

- Overall data-support implications
  - These notes provide essential scaffolding to reproduce sampling locations and verification of data provenance across surveys.
  - They enable accurate relocation of plots, consistent frame/transect sampling, and repeatable ordering of sampling points for comparability over time.
