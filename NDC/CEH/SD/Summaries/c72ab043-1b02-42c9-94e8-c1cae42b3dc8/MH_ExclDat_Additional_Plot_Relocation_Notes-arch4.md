# Additional notes and changes to the plot location and sampling information in Marrs et. al . 1986

## Overview
- Provides detailed, site-specific notes to enable accurate relocation and repeatable ordering of sampling locations across multiple plots.
- Documents changes since earlier diagrams, updating plot locations, marker types, and transect/frame configurations to ensure data provenance and reproducibility.
- Distinguishes between exclosure and grazed plots, with varying numbers of transects, frames, and sampling points per site.
- Notes where recording was reduced (e.g., transects 9 and 10 not recorded at Grazed Transects due to trampling from nearby routes).

## Site-specific sampling layouts
- Knock Fell (Agrostis-Festuca Grassland, D31)
  - Exclosure: 3 m spacing between transects and frames; transects marked with stakes; exclosure not a perfect square but a defined plot inside it.
  - Grazed plot: south of enclosure, split into two sections (Frames 1–6, 7–10); some lines off-line; 8 Permablock markers used; transects 1–8 recorded due to trampling.
- Hard Hill (Festuca Grassland, D40)
  - Within exclosure: short end posts mark transects (north–south) with ~3 m spacing; Permablocks replace marker posts on grazed plot.
  - Documentation includes precise distances from enclosure corners to transect starts/ends; markers located relative to fences.
- Little Dun Fell (Festuca Grassland, D42)
  - Within exclosure: fence line as reference; transects 2 m outside frame ends; frame numbers run north to south in exclosure.
  - Grazed plot: marker posts replaced with Permablocks in a different position; transects run south to north; markers 2 m outside frame positions; distance between transects ~3 m.
- Silverband (Eriophoretum, D34)
  - Both plots: 5 transects per plot with 10 frame positions; exclosure and grazed posts aligned but grazed markers driven into peat; frame crosses transects.
  - Exclosure: start/end posts near fences; precise distances from fences provided.
  - Grazed: marker posts offset from exclosure posts; transects run SE–NW; 2 m offset between transects and marker posts.
- Troutbeck Head (Eriophoretum, D30)
  - Both plots: 5 transects, 10 frame positions; 500 pin positions total; exclosure and grazed layouts oriented similarly with defined relationships to fences and upslope/downslopes.
  - Grazed: transects West–East with defined gaps and 2 m frame-to-marker spacing noted.
- Bog Hill (Calluna-Eriophoretum, D26)
  - Both plots: 7 transects with paired 1 m × 1 m quadrats (A and B) beside transects; 126 potential quadrats; 40 quadrats resurveyed per survey.
  - Recording uses a grid of 400 pin positions (10 pins per quadrat across 5 frame positions); consistent selection of 40 quadrats across surveys.
- Cottage Hill (J1, Juncus Squarrosus Grassland, D20)
  - Both plots: 10 transects, 10 frame positions each; 1000 pin positions total; transects run SE to NW with 1 m spacing and frames starting 1 m from marker posts.
  - Ungrazed plot adjacent to enclosure; same frame spacing/orientation as the enclosed plot.
- River Tees (N1, Nardus Stricta Grassland, D33)
  - Both plots: 10 transects, 10 frame positions; 1000 pin positions; end posts mark transect ends; frame positions increment at 1.5 m intervals from the North marker.
  - Ungrazed plot divided into three sections (transsects 1–3, 4–6, 7–10) with sections oriented east–west; transects numbered East to West near the river.
- Moss Burn (Johnny’s Flush, D44)
  - Both plots: 10 transects with 6 frame positions; 300 pin positions (5 pins per quadrat across replicates); plots arranged as 1 m × 1 m quadrats labeled A–J (along long axis) and 1–6 (short axis).
  - Recording uses fixed quadrat layout with 10 pins per quadrat; grazed plot located 2 m upslope of fence line; fence lines and plots remain bounded but markers may be buried under vegetation.

## Common data collection principles
- Exclosure and grazed plots are recorded in parallel where possible to enable comparative analyses.
- Transects are systematically spaced (commonly 2–3 m or 3 m) with frames positioned along transects at regular intervals (commonly 3 m), and frame positions straddle transect lines.
- Marker systems include wooden stakes, Permablock markers, and occasionally the need for metal detectors when markers are obscured.
- Frame numbering and orientation vary by site (e.g., some sites frame numbers run N–S, others S–N); orientation and numbering are explicitly described per site to maintain consistency.
- Precise relative positioning is provided with respect to fences, corner posts, and other fixed features to enable relocation and repeatability.

## Data quality, challenges, and notes
- Some transects were not recorded in certain plots due to external disruptions (e.g., Pennine Way route near Grazed plots).
- Marker visibility can change over time; markers may be buried or replaced (Permablocks introduced as replacements).
- At some sites, frame directions differ between exclosure and grazed plots (e.g., Little Dun Fell), necessitating careful metadata to preserve orientation.
- Documentation emphasizes the ability to locate markers with metal detectors when markers are not visible.

## Data governance and management implications for Data Leaders
- Establish and enforce standardized metadata templates that capture:
  - Site name, grid/D-number, plot type (exclosure vs grazed), transect count, frame positions, spacing, and orientation.
  - Marker type and exact locations relative to fixed features; notes on marker replacement or relocation.
  - Recording scheme details (frames straddling transects, distances to fences/posts, azimuth/orientation).
  - Any disruptions, missing transects, or changes since prior surveys.
- Ensure data provenance and versioning to track changes in plot locations, marker systems, and recording schemes across surveys.
- Maintain clear, centralized documentation linking site-level protocols to a master data dictionary to support cross-site comparability and reproducibility.
- Promote data discoverability by standardizing site codes, plot labels, and cross-referencing to Marrs et al. 1986 for historical context.
- Align data collection practices with wider community standards to support cross-site synthesis and data sharing.
