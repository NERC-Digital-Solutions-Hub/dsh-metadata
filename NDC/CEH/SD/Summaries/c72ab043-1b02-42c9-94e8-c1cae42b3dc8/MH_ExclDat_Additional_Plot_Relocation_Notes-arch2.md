# Additional notes and changes to the plot location and sampling information in Marrs et. al . 1986

- Purpose: Provide details to enable accurate relocation and repeatable ordering of sampling locations across surveys, including marker updates, transect/frame layouts, and orientation for multiple sites.

## Knock Fell (Agrostis-Festuca Grassland, D31)
- Exclosure: transects 3 m apart; frames 3 m apart along each transect; pin frame location straddles the transect line. Exclosure plot is a rectangle within a non-rectangular overall area; transects marked with wooden stakes.
- Grazed plot: located south of the enclosure; split into two sections (Frames 1–6 and Frames 7–10); some off-line alignment with the enclosure; transects 9–10 no longer recorded due to trampling from the Pennine Way; marker posts replaced with Permablock markers placed 2 m from transect ends.
- Notable relocation details: distances from fences and corners given for multiple transects; some specific stake positions relative to fences provided to aid reestablishment.

## Hard Hill (Festuca Grassland, D40)
- Marker updates: grazed plot marker posts replaced with Permablocks; some reference distances between markers (27 m apart) and their relation to exclosure posts.
- Layout: transects run north–south; frames 1 m from marker lines and then at 3 m intervals; exclosure and grazed plots similarly structured but with updated marker placements.

## Little Dun Fell (Festuca Grassland, D42)
- Within exclosure: measurements anchored to existing fence line; transects run north–south; frames at 3 m intervals with ends 1–2 m outside markers.
- Grazed plot: located south of exclosure; frame markers repositioned as Permablocks; transects numbered south to north (opposite orientation to exclosure); start/end marker distances provided to enable relocation.
- Marker strategy: Permablocks used where visible; translation of frame numbering between plots documented.

## Silverband (Eriophoretum, D34)
- Both plots: 5 transects, 10 frame positions; 500 pin positions total (all frame points recorded).
- Exclosure vs grazed: posts 2 m outside frame 1 and 1 m outside frame 10; orientation and marker placement noted; grazed stakes driven into peat for stability.
- Relocation cues: detailed start/end post distances from fences and orientation of transects (east–west for exclosure; SE–NW for grazed) to aid repeatable positioning.

## Troutbeck Head (Eriophoretum, D30)
- Both plots: 5 transects, 10 frame positions; 500 pin positions; frames straddle transect lines.
- Orientation: exclosure rectangle slightly downhill West–East; grazed plot offset by ~2–3 m and parallel to the exclosure.
- Relocation cues: start/end transect positions relative to fences and neighboring plots documented.

## Bog Hill (Calluna-Eriophoretum, D26)
- Structure: 7 transects with paired 1 m x 1 m quadrats (A/B on either side); transects 9 m long; 40 quadrats repeatedly resurveyed; 400 pin positions recorded (5 frame positions per quadrat, with two randomly allocated pins per frame position).
- Quadrats recorded: lists indicate which quadrats (A/B) in each transect section were surveyed; same 40 quadrats reused each survey for consistency.
- Relocation context: exact quadrat and frame-position mapping provided to ensure consistent resampling.

## Cottage Hill (J1, Juncus Squarrosus Grassland, D20)
- Plot layout: 10 transects with 10 frame positions each; 1000 pin positions total.
- Orientation: plot runs SE (downslope) to NW (upslope); transects 1 m apart; frames start 1 m from marker posts and spaced at 2 m intervals.
- Relocation cues: frame positions straddle transect lines; orientation and spacing documented for repeat surveys.

## River Tees (N1, Nardus Stricta Grassland, D33)
- Layout: 10 transects, 10 frame positions per transect; 1000 pin positions.
- Exclosure vs grazed: end posts mark transects in the enclosed plot; frames start 0.5 m from North marker posts and proceed at 1.5 m intervals.
- Sectioned ungrazed plot: transects grouped into three sections (1–3, 4–6, 7–10) running east–west with transects numbered west-to-east; detailed section coordinates provided for relocation.
- Relocation cues: cross-plot alignment and end-marker positions documented to preserve ordering across surveys.

## Moss Burn (Johnny's Flush, D44)
- Layout: 10 transects with 6 frame positions; 300 pin positions (10 pins per quadrat across 6 frames).
- Plot configuration: fenced exclosure with an adjacent grazed plot located 2 m upslope; plots divided into 1 m x 1 m quadrats A–J along the long axis (east–west) and 1–6 across the short axis (upslope).
- Frame placement: pin frame across each quadrat at 45 cm; pins recorded at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (replicates 1–5).
- Relocation cues: fixed quadrat layout and frame positions mapped for consistent resampling despite enclosure opening.

- General notes across sites:
  - Many plots use a standardized approach to transect spacing (commonly 3 m) and frame spacing (often 3 m or 2–3 m increments) with the pin frame location straddling the transect line.
  - Marker reliability and visibility are addressed by replacing some wooden posts with Permablock markers and noting that some markers can be located with a metal detector when vegetation obscures them.
  - Where routes or trampling (e.g., Pennine Way) affect data collection, transects may be reduced or not recorded, and relocation notes specify which transects were affected.
  - Detailed positional references (distances from fences, corners, exclosure boundaries, and between markers) are provided to support precise re-establishment of sampling points in follow-up surveys.
