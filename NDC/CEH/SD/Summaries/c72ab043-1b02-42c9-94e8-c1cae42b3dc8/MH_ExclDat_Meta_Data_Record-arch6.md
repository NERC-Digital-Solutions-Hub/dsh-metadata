# Moor House National Nature Reserve grazing exclosures long-term vegetation monitoring

## Overview
- Long-standing monitoring at Moor House NNR to assess the impact of removing sheep grazing on upland vegetation.
- Nine grazing exclosures (1953–1972) with adjacent grazed plots, monitored to separate grazing effects from other environmental changes.
- Exclosures span multiple vegetation types and elevations; ongoing monitoring since 1982 by the Environmental Change Network (ECN) via the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH).
- Data and findings referenced in a body of related ecological literature; outputs supported by supporting documentation.

## Study design and sites
- Structure: nine pairs of plots (one exclosure, one grazed) across Moor House Reserve.
- Vegetation types represented: Nardus grassland, Agrostis-Festuca grassland, Festuca grassland, Calluna-Eriophorum bog, Eriophorum bog, eroding bog, and base-rich flush.
- Elevations: 550–830 m above sea level.
- Purpose: isolate effects of grazing removal from other factors influencing vegetation.

## Data collection methods
- Monitoring method: pin frame.
- Interval: irregular over the experimental period.
- Plot sizes vary; numbers of quadrats per plot differ (details in supporting documentation).
- Lineage and site metadata collected to support data integration and analysis.

## Data quality, availability, and documentation
- Data collection and lineage are maintained by NE and predecessors, with ECN/UKCEH oversight since 1982.
- Supporting documentation provides detailed quadrat counts and plot size information; irregular sampling requires careful data handling and metadata integration.
- Related literature (1960s–2018) provides context and baseline for interpreting long-term vegetation changes.
