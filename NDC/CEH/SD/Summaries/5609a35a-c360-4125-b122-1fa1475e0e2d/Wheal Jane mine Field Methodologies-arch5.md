# Field methodologies Wheal Jane

- What and where
  - River Carnon sampled just downstream of the Wheal Jane mine discharge.
  - Sampling performed as a grab sample using a polythene bucket attached to a nylon cord.

- Sample processing and laboratory
  - Samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
  - Unfiltered samples used for pH and alkalinity determinations.

- Sample containers and preservation
  - To minimise CO2-induced degassing effects on pH, samples intended for pH/alkalinity were stored in filled glass bottles.
  - Subsamples filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose nitrate membranes before storage for metal analysis.

- Acidification and storage
  - Metal-analysis samples acidified to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
  - For anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium), samples stored without acidification.

- Container preparation and storage conditions
  - Polypropylene bottles used for storage; bottles cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and rinsed with distilled water prior to use.
  - All samples stored at 4 °C in the dark.

- Data and quality considerations (for governance and reproducibility)
  - Important metadata to capture: sampling method, location, date/time, sample type (unfiltered vs filtered), filtration step, acidification details, container type, cleaning procedure, storage conditions (temperature, light exposure), and laboratory processing steps.
  - Documentation should note potential degassing effects on pH readings and which analyses used unfiltered versus acidified samples.
  - Clear chain of custody and data lineage (field sampling → Wallingford Laboratories processing) to ensure traceability.
