# Field methodologies Wheal Jane

- Context and aim
  - River Carnon sampled just downstream of the main Wheal Jane mine discharge to assess water quality.
  - Sampling performed as field methodology with subsequent laboratory processing.

- Sampling method
  - Grab samples collected using a polythene bucket attached to a nylon cord.
  - Samples delivered to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
  - Unfiltered samples used for pH and alkalinity measurements.
  - pH readings protected from degassing by using filled glass bottles to minimise CO2 changes.

- Processing and filtration
  - Subsamples filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose nitrate membranes.
  - Subsamples prepared for metal analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
  - For anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium), samples stored without acidification.

- Preservation and storage
  - Glass bottles used for pH/alkalinity; filled to minimise degassing.
  - Polypropylene bottles cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and rinsed with distilled water.
  - All samples stored at 4°C in the dark prior to analysis.

- Containers and cleaning
  - Cleanliness and material: glass for some analyses; polypropylene bottles for storage after cleaning.
  - Cleaning procedure specified: 10% HCl wash followed by distilled water rinse.

- Data quality and integrity considerations
  - Acidification performed only for metal preservation; other analyses stored without acidification.
  - Filtration prior to metal analysis to separate particulate matter.
  - Temperature (4°C) and darkness maintained to preserve sample integrity.
  - Methods described to minimize degassing and preserve pH accuracy.

- Implications for data provenance and reproducibility
  - Clear documentation of sample handling, preservation, and storage conditions supports data traceability.
  - Distinct preservation protocols for metals versus anions/nutrients aid comparability across analyses.
