# Field methodologies Wheal Jane

- Context: River Carnon sampled just downstream of the main Wheal Jane mine discharge.
- Sampling method: grab sampling using a polythene bucket attached to a nylon cord.
- Transport: samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
- pH and alkalinity: unfiltered samples used; stored in filled glass bottles to minimise CO2 degassing that would affect pH readings.
- Sub-sampling: subsamples filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose nitrate membranes.
- Metal analysis prep: samples stored prior to metal analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
- Anions and nutrients: stored without acidification.
- Containers and cleaning: polypropylene bottles cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and subsequently rinsed with distilled water.
- Storage conditions: samples stored at 4°C in the dark.
