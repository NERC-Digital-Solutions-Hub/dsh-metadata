# The water quality of the River Carnon, west Cornwall, November 1992 to March 1994: the impacts of Wheal Jane discharges

## Overview
- Daily monitoring of the River Carnon downstream of the Wheal Jane mine discharge to assess the environmental impact.
- Study situates the mining context in west Cornwall and investigates how mine drainage affects river water quality over time.

## Location, mining context and study design
- Wheal Jane mine is near the Carnmenalis granite, with a Devonian slate geology and epithermal to hypothermal mineralization.
- Mining reached 468 m depth by 1982; major ore (Sn, Zn, Cu, Ag) mined until closure in 1991.
- The study builds on prior work describing the initial contamination and subsequent monitoring downstream of the discharge.

## Sampling and analytical methodologies
- In-field pH measurement; water samples filtered through 0.45-μm filters; samples stored in acid-washed bottles and acidified to 1% v/v with nitric acid to preserve trace metals.
- Trace elements analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES).
- Quality assurance: inclusion of mixed QC standards, weekly checks against USGS SRM 1643c references, cross-checks between new and old calibration standards, and internal CEH Wallingford QC standards.
- The laboratory participates in UK/international interlaboratory comparisons and maintains a rigorous QA system.

## Hydrology and data handling
- No stable gauging structure for River Carnon; a gauge board provided rough stage measurements early on.
- Stage data initially unreliable; comparison with high-quality flow data from the adjacent River Fal showed curvilinear stage–flow relationships and poor reliability in the early period.
- Linear regression of flow on Fal data versus Carnon stage indicated:
  - R² = 0.274 for the full dataset (N = 423)
  - R² = 0.821 after excluding the first four months (N = 324)
- Consequence: River Fal flow data were used as a proxy for River Carnon flow in analyses because:
  - Fal flow better represents the full data record,
  - Carnon stage readings were grainy and less precise,
  - a more reliable, hydrogeochemically sensible relationship existed between Fal flow and Carnon water quality.
- The Fal catchment is larger, so Fal flows are not directly comparable in magnitude but are used to illustrate determinant concentration changes with flow.

## Data interpretation and limitations
- Interrelationships between Fal flow and Carnon water quality were more uniform than those using Carnon stage, supporting the use of Fal flows to interpret concentration changes related to discharge.
- Early data are acknowledged as unreliable due to stage measurement limitations; later data provide a more robust basis for assessing the impact of discharge on water quality.
