# The water quality of the River Carnon, west Cornwall, November 1992 to March 1994: the impacts of Wheal Jane discharges

## Overview
- Daily monitoring of River Carnon downstream of Wheal Jane mine to assess chemical impacts from mine discharges.
- Focus on pH in the field, filtration and storage of samples, and trace element analysis with stringent quality control.
- Hydrological context considered using River Fal flow as a surrogate due to unreliable stage measurements early in the study.

## Location and Study Context
- Wheal Jane mine in west Cornwall, near the Carnmenalis granite; mining history and metal production (Sn, Zn, Cu, Ag) with closure in 1991.
- Prior work referenced for initial contamination and subsequent studies on the site.

## Field Sampling and Sample Handling
- In-field pH measurements; water samples filtered through 0.45-μm filters.
- Samples stored in acid-washed polypropylene bottles and acidified to 1% v/v with concentrated nitric acid to prevent deterioration.

## Laboratory Analysis and QA
- Trace elements measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES).
- Quality controls: mixed standards cross-checked weekly against USGS SRM 1643c; batch-to-batch cross-checks; internal CEH Wallingford standards included with each batch.
- Participation in UK/international interlaboratory comparisons; rigorous QA system maintained.

## Hydrology and Data Handling
- No dedicated flow gauging structure; stage readings initially unreliable due to crude stage board installation improvements after ~4 months.
- Regression analysis of River Fal flow vs Carnon stage showed poor fit early (R² ≈ 0.274) improving after stage data stabilization (R² ≈ 0.821 for later data).
- River Fal flow data used as a general representation of river flow and its relation to water quality, because:
  - It better represents the full data record.
  - Stage readings were less precise and grainier.
  - There was a consistent hydrogeochemical relationship between Fal stage and Carnon data in the more reliable period.
  - Fal flows are not directly comparable in magnitude but illustrate changes in determinant concentrations with flow.
- Result: River Fal flows were used to interpret changes in water quality determinants as a function of flow, recognizing catchment differences (Fal larger and higher flow values).

## Data Provenance and Documentation
- Clear documentation of data collection, sample handling, and QA processes.
- Notes on revisions to measurement practices (stage-to-flow relationship) and justification for using surrogate hydrological data.
- Emphasis on transparent methodology to support reproducibility and data reuse.

## Key Findings Relevant to Data Stewardship
- The study demonstrates the importance of robust metadata around hydrological measurements, calibration periods, and data substitutions (e.g., using Fal flow data).
- Highlights challenges in data timeliness and interoperability when multiple measurement approaches and reference systems are used.
- Illustrates how QA protocols and interlaboratory comparisons underpin trust in analytical results for environmental monitoring.

## Challenges and Considerations for Data Governance
- Incomplete or evolving understanding of user needs and data usage contexts.
- Timely collection and standardization of data from diverse systems and formats.
- Ensuring metadata completeness for samples, QA protocols, and event-specific conditions (e.g., early-stage data unreliability).
- Managing larger or legacy datasets and ensuring interoperability across sites or surrogate datasets.
