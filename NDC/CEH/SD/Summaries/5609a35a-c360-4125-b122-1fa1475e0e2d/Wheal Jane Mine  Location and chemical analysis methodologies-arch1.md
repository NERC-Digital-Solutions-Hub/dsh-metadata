# The water quality of the River Carnon, west Cornwall, November 1992 to March 1994: the impacts of Wheal Jane discharges

## Overview
- Daily monitoring of River Carnon downstream of the Wheal Jane mine to assess the impacts of mine discharges.
- Geological and mining context: Wheal Jane lies near the Carnmenalis granite; historic mining for Sn, Zn, Cu, Ag; mine closed in 1991.
- Focus on trace elements in water collected, stored, and analyzed with rigorous quality control.

## Location, sampling, and analytical methodology
- Field pH measurement; water samples filtered through 0.45-μm filters; samples stored in acid-washed bottles.
- Samples acidified to 1% v/v with concentrated nitric acid to prevent deterioration (e.g., sorption, precipitation) before laboratory analysis.
- Trace elements determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES).
- QA procedures: use of mixed quality control standards cross-checked weekly against USGS SRM 1643c references; batch-to-batch calibration checked; CEH Wallingford standards included; participation in UK/international interlaboratory comparisons; rigorous overall QA system.

## Hydrology and data handling
- No built-in gauging structure for precise flow measurements; a gauge board provided only crude stage readings early in the study.
- Stage vs. flow: early data were unreliable; linear regression of flow (Fal) vs. stage (Carnon) showed R^2 of 0.274 for full data and 0.821 after excluding initial 4 months.
- Decision to use River Fal flow data rather than Carnon stage data for the analysis due to:
  - Fal flow data being more representative of the full record.
  - Stage readings being grainy and less precise (stage range ~14 cm); flow data provided more reliable and consistent readings.
  - A strong, more reliable hydrological relationship when stage data were accurate; distinct patterns between early (unreliable) and later (reliable) stages.
  - The Fal catchment is larger; thus Fal flows are used in a general sense to illustrate changes in determinant concentrations with flow.
- Implication: River Fal flows are used to illustrate trends in water quality as a function of flow; Carnon stage data showed less uniform hydrogeochemical patterns.

## Data interpretation and what was considered
- Uniform interrelationships between River Fal flows and water-quality data supported using Fal flows as a surrogate for understanding how concentrations change with flow.
- Less uniform patterns when using early Carnon stage data, underscoring the importance of data quality and representative hydrological proxies in interpreting contaminant trends.
