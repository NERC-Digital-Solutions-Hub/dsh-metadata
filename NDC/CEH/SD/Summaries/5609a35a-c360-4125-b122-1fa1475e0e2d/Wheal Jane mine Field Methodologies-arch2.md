# Field methodologies Wheal Jane

- Sampling location and method: River Carnon sampled just downstream of the main Wheal Jane mine discharge using grab sampling with a polythene bucket attached to a nylon cord; samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
- pH and alkalinity handling: Unfiltered samples used for pH and alkalinity determination; samples kept in filled glass bottles prior to analysis to minimise carbon dioxide changes (degassing) that would affect pH readings.
- Subsampling and filtration: Subsamples filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose nitrate membranes; samples stored prior to metal analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
- Anions and nutrients handling: For anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium), samples stored without acidification.
- Storage containers and cleaning: Polypropylene bottles used for storage; bottles cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and subsequently rinsed with distilled water.
- Storage conditions: Samples stored at 4°C in the dark.
