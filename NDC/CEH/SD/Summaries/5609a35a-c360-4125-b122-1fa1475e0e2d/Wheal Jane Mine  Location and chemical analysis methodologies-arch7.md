# The water quality of the River Carnon, west Cornwall, November 1992 to March 1994: the impacts of Wheal Jane discharges

- Study scope and location
  - Daily monitoring of the River Carnon downstream of the Wheal Jane mine discharge in west Cornwall (7 km northeast of the Carnmenalis granite outcrop).
  - Mine details: Devonian slate host rocks; epithermal to hypothermal mineralization; mined for Sn, Zn, Cu, Ag; depth up to 468 m; operation ceased in 1991.
  - Contextual references to prior work on initial contamination and remediation.

- Sampling and chemical analysis methods
  - In-field pH measurements.
  - Water samples filtered through 0.45-μm polycarbonate filters; stored in acid-washed bottles.
  - Samples acidified to 1% v/v with concentrated nitric acid to prevent deterioration before laboratory analysis.
  - Trace elements measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES).
  - Quality control: mixed QC standards included; weekly checks against USGS SRM 1643c references; calibration batches cross-checked; in-house QC standards included with each sample batch; complete remake of standards if significant discrepancies occurred.
  - Laboratory QA: CEH Wallingford participates in UK and international interlaboratory comparison exercises; rigorous QA system maintained.

- Hydrology and flow data
  - No dedicated gauging structure on River Carnon; a gauge board provided stage estimates early in the study, later refined.
  - Stage readings compared to high-quality flow data from the nearby River Fal to establish a relationship; initial stage data were unreliable due to early-stage measurement issues.
  - Linear regression of flow on the River Fal versus Carnon stage (with log transformation to address curvature) yielded:
    - R^2 = 0.274 (N = 423) for the full dataset.
    - R^2 = 0.821 (N = 324) after excluding the first four months.
  - Decision to use River Fal flow data as a surrogate for Carnon flow because:
    - Fal flow better represents the full data record.
    - Carnon stage readings were grainier and less precise (maximum stage range ~14 cm, read to nearest cm).
    - The hydrological dynamics of Fal were considered proportionally representative for Carnon flows.
    - Comparisons show uniform, hydrogeochemically sensible interrelationships between Fal flows and Carnon water quality, whereas Carnon stage data produced less uniform patterns.
  - Note: Fal catchment is larger, so Fal flows are higher; used in a general sense to illustrate concentration changes with flow rather than exact Carnon-specific flow values.

- Data integration and GIS implications
  - Data are drawn from multiple sources (in-field measurements, lab analyses, proxy hydrological data), illustrating common GIS and data management challenges:
    - Aligning data at different resolutions (stage vs. flow, discrete sampling vs. continuous flow proxies).
    - Data gaps and initial unreliable measurements requiring careful quality assessment.
    - The need to document provenance and QA for reproducible spatial analyses and map-based presentation of water quality versus flow.

- Key conclusions and relevance for GIS work
  - The study demonstrates how to combine field measurements, laboratory analysis, and hydrological proxies to assess contaminant-related water quality downstream of an industrial discharge.
  - Highlights the importance of robust QA/QC and the use of external references for trace element analyses.
  - Shows the value of using a larger, more reliable hydrological proxy (River Fal flow) to interpret contaminant concentrations over time and to mitigate limitations in local flow measurements.
  - Provides a methodological blueprint for spatially contextualizing water quality data with respect to discharge points, flow regimes, and data provenance.
