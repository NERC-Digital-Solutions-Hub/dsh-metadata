# Field methodologies Wheal Jane

## Purpose and context
- Describes sampling of the River Carnon just downstream of the Wheal Jane mine discharge to assess water quality and prepare samples for subsequent chemical analyses.

## Sampling method
- Grab samples collected with a polythene bucket attached to a nylon cord.
- Sampling location downstream of the mine discharge, with samples sent to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.

## Sample handling and storage before analysis
- Unfiltered samples used for pH and alkalinity determinations.
- Glass bottles filled to minimize carbon dioxide exchange (degassing) that would affect pH readings.
- Subsamples filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose nitrate membranes.
- Metal analysis samples acidified to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
- For anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium), samples stored without acidification.
- Storage containers: polypropylene bottles; bottles cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and rinsed with distilled water.
- Storage conditions: 4 °C in the dark.

## Analytical preparations and data quality considerations
- Filtration and acidification steps prepared specific subsets of samples for targeted analyses (metals vs. anions/nutrients).
- Measures to minimize CO2 degassing and preserve sample integrity, ensuring more reliable pH and metal measurements.
- Clear separation of preservation methods for different analyte groups to maintain data quality.

## Implications for data use and reproducibility
- Detailed methodology supports data comparability across samples and potential data reuse in dashboards or reports.
- Documentation of storage and treatment (acidification, filtration, temperature, and light exposure) is essential for accurate interpretation and replication of analyses.
