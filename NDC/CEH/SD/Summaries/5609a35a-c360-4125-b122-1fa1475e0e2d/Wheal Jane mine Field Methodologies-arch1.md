# Field methodologies Wheal Jane

## Sampling location and method
- River Carnon sampled just downstream of the main Wheal Jane mine discharge.
- Field method: grab sampling using a polythene bucket attached to a nylon cord.

## Sample handling and processing
- Samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
- Unfiltered samples used for pH and alkalinity determination.
- Subsamples filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose nitrate membranes.

## Preservation and storage
- Glass bottles used for samples kept prior to analysis to minimize carbon dioxide degassing that could affect pH readings.
- For metal analysis:
  - Subsamples stored after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
- For anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium):
  - Stored without acidification.

## Containers and cleaning
- Polypropylene bottles used for storage.
- Bottles cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and subsequently rinsed with distilled water.

## Storage conditions
- Samples stored at 4°C in the dark.
