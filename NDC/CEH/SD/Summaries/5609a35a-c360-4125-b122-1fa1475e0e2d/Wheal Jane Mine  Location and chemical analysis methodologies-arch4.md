# The water quality of the River Carnon, west Cornwall, November 1992 to March 1994: the impacts of Wheal Jane discharges

## Summary
- Presents a daily monitoring study of River Carnon downstream of the Wheal Jane mine discharge in west Cornwall, focusing on water quality and hydrology.
- Describes site geology, mining history, and the rationale for monitoring the Carnon River to assess mine drainage impacts.
- Details sampling and analytical methods, including field pH measurement, filtration, sample preservation, and trace element analysis via ICPOES with rigorous QA/QC.
- Highlights data challenges in hydrology due to lack of a proper gauging structure and unreliable stage measurements early in the program.
- Explains the decision to use River Fal flow data as a surrogate for River Carnon flow to support interpretation of concentration vs. flow relationships, while noting limitations due to catchment size differences.
- Emphasizes the need for representative hydrological data to correctly interpret chemical determinants and to ensure hydrogeochemical, interpretive consistency.

## Data collection and analytical methods
- Location: Wheal Jane mine near Carnmenalis granite; monitoring downstream of mine discharge.
- Sampling and in-field measurements:
  - pH measured on-site.
  - Water samples collected after filtration through 0.45-μm filters.
  - Samples stored in acid-washed bottles and acidified to 1% v/v with ARISTAR nitric acid to prevent sorption and precipitation pre-analysis.
- Laboratory analysis:
  - Trace elements determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES).
  - Quality control: mixed standards included in analyses; standards checked weekly against USGS SRM 1643c; batch-to-batch cross-checks; internal CEH Wallingford QA standards included with every sample batch.
  - Laboratory participates in UK/international interlaboratory comparisons; maintains rigorous QA system.
- Flow and stage data:
  - No dedicated gauging structure; a stage board installed early in monitoring, later treated as unreliable.
  - Initial stage readings found to be curvilinearly related to flow; limited precision with small stage changes (up to 14 cm range).
  - Linear regression of flow (Fal River) vs stage (logged data to account for nonlinearity) showed significant improvement after the initial four months.
  
## Hydrology and data reliability
- Relationship between stage (Carnon) and flow (Fal) is curvilinear and unstable in early data; early data had poor reliability.
- Reasons for using River Fal flow data:
  - Fal flow data more representative of the overall data record.
  - Carnon stage readings were noisy and less precise, making flow estimates more reliable from Fal.
  - Strong hydrogeochemical consistency between Carnon and Fal patterns when stage data were unreliable; less consistent relationships when relying on early Carnon stage data.
- Cautions:
  - Fal catchment is larger; flows are not directly equivalent to Carnon flows, so Fal data are used in a general sense to illustrate how determinant concentrations vary with flow, not as exact Carnon equivalents.

## Data management and interpretation
- Ensuring data quality and comparability is central due to reliance on surrogate hydrological data and rigorous QA/QC practices for chemical analyses.
- The study emphasizes careful consideration of data limitations (poor initial stage data, use of surrogate flow) when interpreting the relationship between contaminants and hydrological conditions.
- Cross-site comparability and methodological transparency (sampling, preservation, QA, and data substitution decisions) support robust interpretation of mine-related impact on water quality.
