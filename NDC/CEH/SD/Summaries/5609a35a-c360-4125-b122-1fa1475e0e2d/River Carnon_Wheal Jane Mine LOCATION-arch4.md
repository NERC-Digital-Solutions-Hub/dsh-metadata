# River Carnon

## Key data points
- Start date: 1992-09-15
- End date: 1994-11-04
- Grid reference: SW772426
- Numerous other fields are empty or filled with placeholders (many " = . " entries)

## Data quality and metadata
- Heavy presence of missing values and placeholder data across the record
- Repeated blocks with no filled attributes, indicating inconsistent or incomplete data
- No clear data schema, standards, or metadata definitions evident
- Metadata clarity and field definitions are unclear, making interpretation difficult

## Data discovery and access
- Verifying content, format, and provenance is challenging due to dispersed and incomplete fields
- Lack of consistent metadata hinders discoverability and reuse
- No explicit data lineage or source documentation provided

## Implications for data strategy (Data Leaders)
- Demonstrates a need for end-to-end data governance: defined schema, consistent metadata, and data quality controls
- Highlights importance of co-ownership and collaboration with stakeholders to validate and enrich data products
- Current dataset has limited utility for decision-making without completion and validation of attributes

## Recommendations for next steps
- Establish a core data schema for River Carnon data (e.g., start_date, end_date, grid_ref, location, attributes)
- Populate missing fields and standardize formats and units
- Create and publish a comprehensive metadata dictionary and data lineage
- Implement data quality checks and flag incomplete or inconsistent records
- Improve discoverability by adding descriptive metadata and indexing geospatial attributes
- Engage stakeholders to confirm user needs and required attributes; plan data enrichment if needed
- Consider integrating with additional data sources to provide a fuller, more actionable record
