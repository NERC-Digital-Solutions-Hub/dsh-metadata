# Field methodologies Wheal Jane

## Overview
- River Carnon sampled just downstream of the Wheal Jane mine discharge.
- Purpose: obtain water quality data for analysis and mapping.

## Sampling method
- Grab samples collected using a polythene bucket attached to a nylon cord.
- Samples taken downstream of the mine discharge.

## Laboratory processing and pH/alkalinity handling
- Samples sent to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
- Unfiltered samples used for pH and alkalinity determinations.
- To minimize CO2 degassing and pH changes, samples were stored in filled glass bottles prior to analysis.

## Subsampling and metals
- Subsamples filtered through 0.45 µm cellulose nitrate membranes.
- Samples stored prior to metal analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.

## Anions and nutrients
- For anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium), samples stored without acidification.

## Storage containers and cleaning
- Polypropylene bottles used for storage.
- Bottles cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and rinsed with distilled water.

## Storage conditions
- Samples stored at 4°C in the dark.

## GIS and data quality implications
- Spatial context: downstream location relative to mine discharge is important for mapping gradients.
- Provenance and metadata: explicit handling steps improve traceability in GIS datasets.
- Analyte-specific preservation: metals require acidification; anions/nutrients do not—affects data comparability and units.
- Filtration: 0.45 µm filtration defines measured fractions; consider differentiating filtered vs. unfiltered data in maps.
- Storage conditions: low temperature and dark storage enhance sample integrity; important for data reliability in GIS records.
- Metadata needs: capture container type, preservatives, filtration, acidification, storage temperature, and storage duration for accurate GIS documentation.
