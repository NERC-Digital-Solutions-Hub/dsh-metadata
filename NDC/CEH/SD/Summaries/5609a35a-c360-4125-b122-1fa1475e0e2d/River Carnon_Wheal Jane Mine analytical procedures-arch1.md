## Overview
- This document is a comprehensive metadata/dictionary block for dissolved chemical species analyzed in samples collected between 1992 and 1994, primarily at Wallingford (UK).
- It catalogs multiple analytes and their associated metadata, including units, detection/reporting limits, time window, laboratory, preservation, filtration, and analytical methods.

## Analyte coverage and structure
- Analytes documented include: Al, B, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cs, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Nd, Ni, Pr, Rb, Pb, Si, Sr, Th, U, Y, Zn, and more.
- For each analyte, the record provides:
  - Units (e.g., µg/l, mg/l, pH)
  - Lower quantification/detection limits (LQDC)
  - QUOTE TO (reporting limit)
  - START and END dates of the measurement window
  - Lab (e.g., Wallingford)
  - Method quality control and Data qualifier
  - Filtration details
  - Preservation method
  - Analytical METHOD (e.g., ICP-OES, ICP-MS, or colorimetric)
  - Placeholder values (often = .) indicating missing measurements or template structure
- Many analyte sections share the same start/end window, though some entries show variations or multiple similar blocks.

## Methods and instrumentation
- Predominant techniques:
  - Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) using an Elmer 3300 DV (for many elements)
  - Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for certain elements (e.g., Th, U, Nd, Pr)
  - Colorimetric methods used for some species (e.g., Si)
- Filtration performed in the field with 47 mm 0.45 µm membranes; samples preserved by acidification (typically 1% HNO3) and stored cold.

## Sample handling and preservation
- Field filtration prior to laboratory analysis; rain can affect field handling (noted in some entries).
- Preservation generally involves acidification to 1% with high-purity nitric acid; storage conditions often include cooling, with references to CO2-degassing considerations for certain measurements.
- Temperature-keeping and light protection mentioned in some sections, varying by analyte.

## Data quality and gaps
- Many fields contain placeholder "." or missing values for concentrations, indicating:
  - A metadata/template scaffold
  - Incomplete data extraction from the source
- Data qualifiers and method QC fields are frequently blank, highlighting potential gaps in data completeness and quality indicators.
- The document is part of a larger set that includes additional analytes with similar metadata structures.

## Temporal and provenance details
- Primary measurement window: START = 15-Sep-92 to END = 04-Nov-94.
- Lab responsible for analyses: Wallingford (UK) for dissolved species such as Al and Sr; other sections (e.g., conductivity, temperature) reference Field or Wallingford as applicable.
- The metadata emphasizes traceability: units, LQDC, QUOTE TO, dates, lab, and method details are specified to support reproducibility.

## Practical considerations for analysts
- Expect numerous missing values; verify which analytes have actual measurements in a given subset.
- Use the provided units, LQDC, and QUOTE TO to interpret reporting limits and detection capabilities.
- Note consistent filtration and preservation methods across analytes to ensure comparability.
- Consider the laboratory and method context (Wallingford; ICP-OES vs ICP-MS vs colorimetric) when comparing results across elements.
- Track data sources and provenance (start/end dates, lab, method) to ensure reproducibility.

## Endnotes and scope
- The document continues with additional analytes (e.g., Pr, Rb, Pb, Si, Nd, Ni, Cu, Na, etc.) in similar metadata structures, but many measurements are left as placeholders, suggesting a metadata/template or incomplete data extraction for those items.
- Overall, this serves as a detailed metadata dictionary for dissolved species in a 1992–1994 Wallingford dataset, with substantial missing data that users must validate before analysis.
