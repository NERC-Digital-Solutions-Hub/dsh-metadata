# The water quality of the River Carnon, west Cornwall, November 1992 to March 1994: the impacts of Wheal Jane discharges

## Overview
- Daily monitoring of the River Carnon downstream of the Wheal Jane mine discharges from November 1992 to March 1994.
- Objective: assess the impacts of mine drainage on river water quality, including trace elements measured by advanced instrumentation.
- Data collection integrated field measurements, laboratory analyses, and cross-referenced hydrological data to interpret flows and chemical determinants.

## Methods: Sampling, Analysis, and Quality Assurance
- Field measurements: pH measured on site; water samples filtered through 0.45-μm polycarbonate filters; samples stored in acid-washed bottles.
- Preservation: samples acidified to 1% v/v with ARISTAR-grade nitric acid to prevent sorption or precipitation of trace metals before lab analysis.
- Laboratory analysis: trace elements determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES).
- Quality control: incorporation of mixed quality control standards, weekly checks against USGS SRM 1643c references, cross-checks between old and new calibration standards, and inclusion of CEH Wallingford QA standards with each sample batch.
- Interlaboratory benchmarking: CEH Wallingford participates in UK and international interlaboratory comparisons; rigorous QA systems maintained.

## Hydrology and Data Handling
- Hydrological setup: no dedicated gauging structure for River Carnon; a gauge board provided stage estimations early in the study, with subsequent reliability issues.
- Stage vs. flow: initial stage readings were crude and unreliable; flow data from the nearby River Fal used as a surrogate for Carnon flow in analyses.
- Rationale for using Fal flow data:
  - Fal flow data represent the broader, more complete dataset.
  - Carnon stage readings were less precise and more grainy; reliable stage–flow relationships only emerged after the initial period.
  - The hydrological relationship between Carnon stage and Fal flow appeared consistent once the unreliable early data were excluded.
  - Comparisons showed uniform hydrogeochemical interrelationships when using Fal flows with Carnon water quality data; stage data exhibited more irregular patterns.
- Scale considerations: the Fal catchment is much larger, so Fal flows are higher; used only in a general sense to illustrate how determinant concentrations change with flow.

## Data Analysis and Interpretation
- Hydrological relationship assessment: linear regression of flow on the River Fal (logged data to address curvilinearity) against Carnon stage data.
  - Full dataset: R² = 0.274 (N = 423).
  - Excluding initial 4 months: R² = 0.821 (N = 324).
- Implications:
  - Early data are unreliable for flow-based interpretation; later data provide a more robust link between flow and water-quality determinants.
  - Using Fal flow data allows general interpretation of how trace elements and other determinants change with flow, in a hydrogeochemically sensible framework.

## Outputs and Implications for Data Use
- Generated time-series data on trace elements and other water-quality determinants with thorough QA.
- Enabled assessment of the environmental impact of Wheal Jane discharges on River Carnon water quality.
- Demonstrates a data-centric approach to managing incomplete or patchy hydrological data by:
  - qualifying data sources and their limitations.
  - validating proxies (Fal flow) for hydrological analyses.
  - documenting data transformation steps (e.g., log-transformations for regression) to handle non-linear relationships.
