# The water quality of the River Carnon, west Cornwall, November 1992 to March 1994: the impacts of Wheal Jane discharges

## Aim and context
- Daily monitoring of the River Carnon downstream of the Wheal Jane mine to assess water quality and the impacts of mine discharges, with emphasis on trace metals and hydrogeochemical relationships.

## Study site and sampling design
- Location: River Carnon downstream of Wheal Jane mine in west Cornwall; mining history and contamination context cited from prior work.
- Sampling and field protocol: pH measured in the field; water samples filtered through 0.45-μm filters; samples stored in acidwashed bottles and acidified to 1% v/v nitric acid to prevent metal sorption and precipitation during storage and transport.
- Laboratory analysis: Trace elements determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES); routine mixed QC standards included.
- Quality control: Standards cross-checked weekly against USGS SRM 1643c references; calibration standards cross-checked with previous batches; if discrepancies arose, new standards were prepared. The laboratory participates in UK/international interlaboratory comparison exercises and maintains a rigorous QA system.

## Hydrology and data handling
- Lack of a proper gauging structure: No direct flow gauge for the Carnon; a stage board was installed initially, but early stage readings were unreliable.
- Relationship between stage and flow: Evaluated by comparing Carnon stage with high-quality flow data from the adjacent River Fal; linear regression of flow on Fal stage (with log transformation) showed:
  - R^2 = 0.274 for the full dataset (N=423)
  - R^2 = 0.821 after excluding the first 4 months (N=324)
- Decision on data use: River Fal flow data were used instead of Carnon stage data because:
  - Fal flow better represents the full data record;
  - Carnon stage readings were less precise (grainier data; only to the nearest centimeter);
  - a more reliable Carnon flow signal could be inferred from Fal data due to hydrogeochemical consistency between the two rivers.
- Implication: Flow-driven analysis of metal concentrations relied on Fal flows as a surrogate for Carnon hydrology; Carnon stage data showed less consistent pattern, highlighting limitations of surrogate metrics and data quality in hydrological interpretation.

## Data processing and interpretation
- Use of flow to interpret concentrations: The study examines determinant concentrations as functions of flow, using Fal flow as a general proxy for Carnon hydrology.
- Observed patterns: The interrelationships between Fal flows and Carnon water quality data are hydrogeochemically sensible and more uniform than those observed when using Carnon stage data.
- Caution on generalization: The Fal catchment is larger than Carnon, so Fal flows are used in a general sense to illustrate changes rather than to provide a direct, site-for-site flow comparison.

## Data governance, sharing, and limitations (relevance to monitoring frameworks)
- Data quality and provenance: Explicit, rigorous QA/QC protocols for sampling and chemical analysis; standardized storage and handling procedures to minimize alteration of sample composition.
- Metadata and data availability: While the study emphasizes QA and method transparency, it does not detail public data sharing practices for underlying datasets.
- Key limitations for monitoring frameworks:
  - Initial unreliable stage measurements; need for robust hydrological measurement infrastructure.
  - Dependence on surrogate hydrological data when direct, high-quality measurements are unavailable or problematic.
  - Differences in catchment size between surrogate (Fal) and target (Carnon) rivers, requiring careful interpretation and avoided overgeneralization.
  - Importance of clear criteria for when and how to substitute proxy data in long-term monitoring programs.

## Key takeaways for monitoring frameworks
- Implement rigorous QA/QC and traceable calibration standards (including interlaboratory comparisons) to ensure data integrity.
- When direct hydrological measurements are lacking or unreliable, justify and document the use of proxy or surrogate flow data, including assessments of representativeness and limitations.
- Document data handling decisions clearly (e.g., filtration, storage, acidification, and data transformation) to enable reproducibility and transparent governance.
- Recognize the value of validating proxies against multiple lines of evidence to ensure hydrogeochemical relationships remain credible.
- Anticipate data gaps and early-phase measurement issues; establish criteria for excluding unreliable portions of time series to preserve analysis quality.
