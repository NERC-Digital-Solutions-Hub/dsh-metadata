# Dissolved Si, Dissolved Sr, Dissolved Th, Dissolved U, Dissolved Y, Dissolved Zn, Electrical conductivity, Temperature, Time, Date

- Overview of the dataset
  - Multi-element dissolved chemistry data for water samples, including dissolved silicon (Si), strontium (Sr), thorium (Th), uranium (U), yttrium (Y), zinc (Zn), and related parameters such as electrical conductivity, temperature, time, and date.
  - Measurements primarily by ICP-OES (e.g., PerkinElmer 3300 DV) with ICP-MS (VG PlasmaQuad PQ1) for select elements (Ce, Nd, La, Pr, etc.) and field/lab handling details.
  - Field filtration (47 mm, 0.45 µm membrane) in field except during rain; preservation by acidification to 1% HNO3; samples stored under specific conditions.
  - Timeframe spans various elements with START/END dates (e.g., 15-Sep-92 to 04-Nov-94 for several dissolved metals) and extended data for electrical conductivity and temperature up to 2009.
- Data structure and metadata
  - Each element has a structured set of metadata fields:
    - UNITS (e.g., µg/l for trace metals; mg/l for some major ions)
    - LQDC (lower quantitation or detection limit)
    - QUOTE TO (quantitative/qualitative reporting threshold)
    - START and END dates
    - LAB (Wallingford)
    - METHOD (instrumentation and technique)
    - Filtration and Preservation method
    - Data qualifier and Method quality control
    -  QA/QC fields (often unpopulated or "."), indicating variable reporting of quality checks
  - Data values themselves frequently appear as blanks or placeholders (e.g., " = ."), signaling incomplete reporting for many elements.
- Methods and quality control
  - Analytical approaches include:
    - ICP-OES for a broad suite of elements using a common instrument
    - ICP-MS for selected elements (Ce, Nd, La, Pr, etc.)
  - Sample handling specifics:
    - Field filtration prior to lab analysis
    - Preservation via 1% HNO3
    - Storage conditions noted for some samples
  - QA/QC fields exist but are frequently not populated, limiting immediate assessment of data reliability.
- Practical implications for Data Leaders
  - Data completeness and standardization:
    - Metadata gaps and inconsistent element-specific fields underscore the need for standardized data dictionaries and uniform reporting conventions.
    - Complex, element-specific metadata (units, detection limits, QA/QC flags) highlight the value of a shared metadata schema.
  - Discoverability and governance:
    - Provenance is clear (Wallingford lab, field protocol), but full data discoverability is hindered by incomplete value reporting and inconsistent field population.
    - Stronger coordination across laboratories and partner networks would improve metadata completeness, harmonize units, and reduce duplication.
  - Data quality and usability:
    - Rich methodological details exist, but missing QA/QC indicators complicate reliability assessment.
    - Co-ownership and collaboration could improve metadata completeness, harmonize standards, and support network-wide reuse.
  - Data product implications:
    - The dataset demonstrates multi-element dissolved chemistry reporting with explicit filtration/preservation protocols and time-series coverage, useful for constructing comparable data products once standards are harmonized.
- Actionable recommendations
  - Develop and enforce a standardized data dictionary for multi-element dissolved chemistry (units, detection limits, QA/QC flags, filtration, preservation, instrumentation).
  - Create a centralized data repository with mandatory, complete metadata for all reported elements to improve discoverability and interoperability.
  - Implement consistent QA/QC reporting across all elements (populate Method quality control and Data qualifier fields).
  - Promote co-ownership of data products by engaging policy colleagues and partner networks to align data formats, update metadata, and share best practices.
