# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 is available in multiple formats to suit different user needs, with UK coverage.
- Two main data streams: vector (most detailed) and raster (summaries).

## Data Formats and Content
- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: polygons for land-cover parcels with attributes describing land cover and metadata on derivation.
  - Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 ha.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: UK.
- Raster data
  - Five raster products total.
  - A 25 x 25 m raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
  - Supply format: GeoTiff.
  - Coverage: UK.
- Further information available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation (Tables 1–3).

## Metadata and Documentation
- Detailed metadata for both vector and raster formats provided in the dataset documentation.
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets.

## Access, Use, and Sharing
- Vector data available as ESRI Shapefile; raster data available as GeoTiff.
- Four 1 km rasters are freely available.
- Documentation provides guidance on attributes, classification, and metadata to enable proper use and interoperability.

## Governance Considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure metadata completeness and alignment with user needs (mapping between classes and Broad Habitat.
- Maintain data availability and update processes, and manage format interoperability between vector and raster products.
- Verify provenance and derivation metadata to support data reuse and trust.
- Direct users to the Dataset Documentation for detailed attributes, class mappings, and raster metadata.
