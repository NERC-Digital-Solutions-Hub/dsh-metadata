# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview
- LCM2007 is provided in both vector and raster formats to accommodate different user needs and workflows.
- Aimed at enabling diverse analyses and data products for exploration and decision-making.

## Formats and Details

- Vector data (most detailed)
  - Representation: polygons for land parcels
  - Attributes: describe land cover
  - Metadata: describes how information was derived
  - Minimum Mapable Unit: 0.5 ha
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile
  - Coverage: UK

- Raster data
  - Five raster products
  - 25 x 25 m raster: most likely Broad Habitat per pixel
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarising the 25 m raster
  - Metadata: detailed in the LCM2007 Dataset Documentation
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes
  - Supply format: GeoTiff

  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets

## How to Use (Data Support Perspective)

- Choose format based on analysis needs:
  - Vector for precise, parcel-level analyses (0.5 ha unit)
  - Raster for scalable habitat classifications and broad overviews
- Leverage provided attributes and class definitions to interpret results
- Consult the dataset documentation tables to understand metadata and class schemes
- Access formats UK-wide; ensure compatibility with ESRI Shapefile and GeoTiff
- Use 25 m raster for detailed habitat mapping; use 1 km rasters for broader summaries
- Refer to documentation when communicating outputs or integrating with other data products
