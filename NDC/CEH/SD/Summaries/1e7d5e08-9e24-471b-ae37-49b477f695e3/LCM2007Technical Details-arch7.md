# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides land cover information in both vector and raster formats to suit different user needs.
- Coverage is UK-wide.
- Designed to support map-based data visualisations and GIS analyses.

## Formats

### Vector data
- Most detailed product: polygons represent land parcels.
- Attributes describe land cover; metadata explains data derivation.
- Minimum mapping unit (MNU): 0.5 hectares.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.

### Raster data
- Five raster products total.
- 25 x 25 m raster: assigns the most likely Broad Habitat to each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters: summarize the 25 m raster data.
- Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
- Supply format: GeoTIFF.

## Coverage and Scales
- Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).
- Detail levels available to support both fine-scale and broad-scale analyses.

## Documentation and Metadata
- Detailed metadata and classifications described in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Key tables available:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets

## How GIS Specialists Can Use LCM2007
- Use vector data for parcel-level land-cover detail and rich attribute information.
- Use raster data for broad habitat mapping and easier integration with other raster layers.
- Combine formats to suit analysis needs, ensuring alignment of resolutions and classifications.
- Refer to the Dataset Documentation for precise attribute definitions, class mappings, and metadata.
