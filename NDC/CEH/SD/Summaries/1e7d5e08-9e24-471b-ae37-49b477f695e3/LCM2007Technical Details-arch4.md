# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview
- Provides UK land cover information in vector and raster formats designed to meet diverse user needs.

## Data formats and scales
- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: polygons represent land parcels with land cover attributes and metadata on how derived.
  - Minimum Mapable Unit for land cover parcels: 0.5 ha.
  - Supply Format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: UK.
- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total.
  - 25 x 25 m raster gives the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
  - Supply Format: GeoTIFF.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
  - Coverage: UK.

## Metadata and documentation
- Detailed metadata and attribute/class information are available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation, including:
  - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes for LCM2007.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

## Access and governance
- Further information and specifics are provided in the dataset documentation, detailing data access, use, and interpretation.

## Considerations for Data Leaders
- Determine suitability by use case and required granularity:
  - Vector for detailed parcel-level analysis (0.5 ha minimum unit).
  - Raster for broad habitat mapping and scalable analyses (25 m detail or coarser 1 km summaries).
- Prioritize data discoverability and governance through complete metadata and documentation.
- Assess data integration needs with other datasets and identify any gaps or updates.
- Align data products with user needs (policy colleagues, researchers, partners) and consider co-ownership of data products when appropriate.
