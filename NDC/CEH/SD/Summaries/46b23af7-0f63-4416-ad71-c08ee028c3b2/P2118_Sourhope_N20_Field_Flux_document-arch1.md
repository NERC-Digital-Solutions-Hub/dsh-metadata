- Background and aims
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (established 1999) focused on linking soil biodiversity with key ecological processes, using the Sourhope field site in the Scottish Borders.
  - 24 projects studied soil structure, carbon and nitrogen cycles, and the roles of microfauna and flora from bacteria to macro-fauna to understand biodiversity and functional roles.

- Field methods and design
  - Static chamber measurements of nitrous oxide (N2O) flux to assess how land management affects nitrogen cycling by nitrifiers and denitrifiers.
  - Experimental treatments: Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Nitrogen + Lime.
  - Plot and sampling design: randomised block treatment allocations across sub-plots (S, T, U, V) with chambers placed in general sampling areas that avoided furrows due to moisture differences; random numbers determined chamber placement order.
  - Chamber construction and operation: 40 cm diameter polypropylene tubes (20 cm long) with PVC flanges, silicone seals, gas sampling tubes, and gas-tight lids; data collected as gas samples at defined intervals.
  - Chamber placement considerations included soil moisture differences between ridges and furrows; chambers assigned to ridges to ensure consistency.

- Methods of analysis and instrumentation
  - N2O measured from samples in Tedlar bags or 10 ml syringes using gas chromatography (GC).
  - GC setup: Chrompak CP 9000 with Poropak Q column and electron capture detector (ECD); oven at 30°C, ECD at 350°C; carrier gas and flow controls configured to achieve ~2.87 min retention time for N2O.
  - Calibration: gas standards (typically 1 ppm N2O in 80% N2 and 20% air) used at start and end of sequences to correct drift and convert millivolts to ppm.
  - Sample handling: backflushing and pre-column treatment to minimize interferences (e.g., H2O).

- Key results
  - Liming increased gross nitrification rates relative to controls (approx. 1.6 μg N d-1) and increased the ratio of nitric (NO) to nitrous oxide (N2O) flux.
  - Addition of nitrogen raised both NO and N2O flux across treatments.
  - However, gross nitrification rates declined under all nitrogen-containing treatments relative to control, lime, and nitrite treatments.
