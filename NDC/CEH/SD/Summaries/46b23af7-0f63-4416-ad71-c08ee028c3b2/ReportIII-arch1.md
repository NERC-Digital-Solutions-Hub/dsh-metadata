# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The Sourhope field experiment is part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute’s Sourhope Farm. A baseline data survey from 1998 provides site context, with measurements documented to enable cross-year comparisons.
- Purpose and approach
  - Provide a broad context for participating groups and facilitate year-to-year comparisons.
  - Present measurement schedules and data to help link with other studies, including monitoring of weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition.
  - Data management includes tracking sources and making datasets discoverable with metadata.
- 2001 notable management events
  - Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions limited site access Feb–May; work proceeded under an agreed timetable with oversight by the site Officer in Charge.
  - First biocide application in May was missed; four subsequent biocide applications completed.
  - Change of site officer in May 2001.

Results

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 headline weather data were broadly unremarkable after a very wet prior year.
  - Rainfall near the long-term annual average; radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture content somewhat higher than in previous years.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - A consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments, with peak biomass in July or August.
  - 2001 biomass was substantially higher than in earlier years, likely due to changes in personnel and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass was normalised against the C1 treatment to compare treatment effects year-on-year.
  - Separate analyses (ln-transformed biomass) show:
    - Significant differences between fertilised/improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) vs unimproved plots.
    - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
    - No significant differences between blocks.

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Lime addition continues to raise topsoil pH (0–5 cm): October 2001 averages were 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime (N&L) plots.
  - Nitrogen alone also raises pH, but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots show no significant pH change since baseline (August 1998).

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - July 2001 Point Analysis followed the same protocol as 2000; surveyors’ results showed no significant differences between surveyors.
  - Total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000, suggesting increased sward density, possibly due to the absence of grazing since 1998.
  - Treatment effects on species composition:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments; Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments and were most frequent in fertilised plots.
    - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) showed more Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, and related species; unimproved plots remained more associated with species like Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
    - Species richness: unimproved treatments supported 24 species; Nitrogen & Lime plots had 18 species, suggesting reduced diversity with higher fertility.
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicated clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Biomass correlations with species abundance:
    - Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundances positively correlated with biomass.
    - Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass increased.
  - Litter frequency increased in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

Site Heterogeneity

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Spatial heterogeneity detected: columns E and F (right-hand slope) contained more acidic plots.
  - Some evidence that the acidic trend is linked to a higher proportion of Control or Biocide plots in these columns, and there is an underlying spatial pattern of lower pH in N and/or Lime plots within these areas.

- 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
  - Several outlier plots with low biomass exist across treatments; central site plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., notable examples include certain Nitrogen, Lime, Biocide, and Control plots).
  - There is a strong positive relationship between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No significant difference in biomass between blocks, indicating limited block-level effects on yield within the design.
