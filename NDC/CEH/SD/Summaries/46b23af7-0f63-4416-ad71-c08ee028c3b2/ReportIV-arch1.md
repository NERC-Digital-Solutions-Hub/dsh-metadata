# Soil Biodiversity Site, Sourhope: Annual Report 2002

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, studying above- and below-ground interactions at the Sourhope field site.
  - Focus on above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and diversity; exploring how mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide treatments drive botanical changes and functional community structure.

- Experimental design and site management
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
  - Treatments randomised at plot level; site-wide mowing to ~6 cm each May–Sept; insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) applied to insecticide plots after mowing; nitrogen and/or lime applied to designated plots.
  - Treatments include: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (biocide) plots.

- Data collection and activity
  - On-site Automatic Weather Station for regular climate data.
  - Above-ground biomass: 0.5 m^2 sampling cells within sub-plots prior to each mowing; samples dried and weighed (since 1999).
  - Baseline vegetation survey in 1998; annual point analyses (1998–2002) using a 100-hole frame to record species hits; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
  - Soil measurements: soil pH (5 cm depth) regularly; soil moisture measured in 2002; additional vegetation surveys and small-scale botanical surveys conducted 2000–2002.
  - Appendices provide detailed site activity, species lists, and data formats.

- Key results: biomass, pH, moisture, and diversity
  - Biomass trends
    - 2002 biomass production fell relative to 2001 across several treatments, but the long-term trajectory since 1999 shows overall biomass increases across treatments.
    - Nitrogen and Lime together (N+L) produced the largest biomass; Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1 in recent years.
    - A negative slope pattern with elevation: lower blocks (on the slope) showed greater declines than lower blocks; overall trend shows higher productivity in more fertile plots.
  - Fertilisation and soil chemical changes
    - Lime additions caused a highly significant rise in soil pH, approaching pH ~7 in the upper soil profile for limed plots; nitrogen also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Strong negative correlation between soil moisture and soil pH (r ≈ -0.68); higher pH plots tended to have lower moisture.
    - A positive link between higher soil pH and above-ground biomass across treatments; when analyzed within treatments, the pH–biomass relationship varied (positive in some, weaker or negative when both N and Lime were applied).
  - Plant community composition and functional groups
    - Two grass species common to improved pastures (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) dominated 2002 hits in N and/or Lime plots (about 54% in N&L, 30% in Lime, 25% in Nitrogen), but remained low in Control and Insecticide plots.
    - Agrostis spp. (A. capillaris and A. vinealis) declined markedly (over 40% since 2000) across most treatments, suggesting mowing and other site factors rather than a single treatment effect.
    - Bryophytes expanded across the site, particularly Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, contributing up to ~20% of hits in 2002, especially in unimproved plots.
    - Point analyses and PCA show clear separation between improved and unimproved plots; bryophyte and dicot increases in unimproved plots accompany declines in certain monocots.
  - Diversity and ecological strategy shifts
    - Shannon diversity index: 2002 shows treatment-related differences; baseline diversity differences emerged in 2000 and became more pronounced in 2001–2002.
    - By 2002, nitrogen-and-lime plots show a decline in Shannon diversity relative to baseline (about 15%), while other treatments show increases (up to 29% in some insecticide plots).
    - Three major functional groups (stress tolerators S; competitive-stress-ruderal CSR; and SR/CSR) consistently dominate, with SR/CSR and CSR groups highly responsive to treatments.
    - In 2002, CSR and SR/CSR groups expanded notably in N+L plots, while unimproved plots favored stress-tolerant species; lime and/or nitrogen reduced the relative abundance of some bryophytes and ruderal species.
  - Other observations
    - Bryophyte abundance increased over time across treatments, with the largest increases in unimproved plots; mosses and liverworts contributed to changes in overall vegetation structure.
    - Insecticide effects on diversity are mixed and not conclusively causal; potential indirect effects via herbivore suppression may benefit certain palatable plant species, but evidence remains circumstantial.
    - Trampling in the C2 plots (first-year introduction) likely contributed to reduced productivity, particularly during intense 13CO2 pulse activities.

- Discussion: interpretation of treatment effects
  - Mowing effect
    - Consistent reduction of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across treatments suggests mowing selects against these species, possibly due to uniform cutting compared with heterogeneous grazing.
    - Festuca rubra expands with mowing, especially in fertilised plots; bryophyte expansion linked to maintained sward height and lack of grazing.
    - Disturbance reduction (absence of grazing) appears to favor stress-tolerant species; overall, mowing influences functional group balance and moss proliferation.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Nitrogen and lime improve productivity, with greatest gains when both are applied together; signs of productivity peaking in some high-N/L plots as soil pH approaches 7 and soil moisture declines.
    - High lime-induced pH shifts favor competitive, high-growth species; potential moisture stress may offset gains in some conditions.
    - The C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) group expands under N+L, while stress-tolerant (S) species prosper in unimproved plots.
  - Insecticide effect
    - Herbivore suppression could indirectly increase diversity by enabling more palatable species to persist, but definitive causal links require further data.
    - Effects align with broader insect-plant interaction literature; context-dependent outcomes suggest cautious interpretation.
  - Trampling effect
    - The 2002 C2 plots, subjected to intensive sampling and 13CO2 pulsing, show reduced biomass likely due to trampling effects rather than treatment per se.

- Implications and future directions
  - Disturbance regime (grazing exclusion) and nutrient status are major drivers of plant productivity and community composition at Sourhope.
  - Nutrient enrichment can boost productivity but may reduce diversity unless managed to maintain a balance with disturbance and moisture constraints.
  - Understanding CSR-based functional shifts helps predict how communities respond to management changes.
  - Continued multi-year data collection and integration across plots will be essential to confirm trends and refine predictive models.
