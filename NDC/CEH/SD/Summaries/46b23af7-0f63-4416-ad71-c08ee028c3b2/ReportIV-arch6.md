# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Four years into the Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders) focusing on how above-ground productivity, species composition and diversity respond to management treatments.
- Main drivers of botanical change identified: mowing regime, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and soil insecticide application; trampling effects also noted in a specific subplot.
- Broad aim: understand links between soil biodiversity research and above-ground plant communities, with data collected to reveal productivity, diversity and functional composition shifts.

## Study design and data collection (Data Support perspective)

- Site and treatments
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope: 5 blocks, 6 main plots per block, treated and randomized; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
  - Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (formerly Biocide).
  - Site-level task: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept) with herbicide/insecticide applications following mowing in insecticide plots.
- data collection and time frame
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (from Feb 1999 onward).
  - Above-ground biomass: yearly 0.5 m^2 cell samples, harvested after each mow, dried and weighed (1999–2002).
  - Baseline vegetation survey: July 1998 using 0.5 m^2 quadrats; follow-up point analysis sweeps in July/August 2000, 2001, 2002 using 100-hole grid over a 0.5 m^2 cell within S, T, U, V sub-plots; 25-point records per observation.
  - Additional plant surveys: bryophyte identification; laminae and litter assessments; occasional small-scale vascular plant and bryophyte surveys; detailed Appendix 3 species lists.
  - Soil measures: soil pH at 5 cm depth (since 1998, March 2002 and July/August 2002 in study cells); soil moisture via theta probe (August 2002 for point analysis cells).
  - Data scale and scope: total site soil samples to August 2002 ~11,621; multiple appendices document site activity, weather, biomass, and species data.
- Data analyses and outputs
  - Descriptive and inferential analyses including split-plot ANOVA (treatment, year, and interactions), Pearson correlations, and polynomial fits for pH–biomass relationships.
  - Multivariate analyses: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of point analysis data; treatment-wise ranking of species hits; functional group categorisation using CSR framework (stress-tolerators,竞争 c-s-r, and SR/c-s-r).
  - Appendices provide comprehensive outputs: biomass by plot (Appendix 6), biomass ranking (Appendix 7), species hit abundances (Appendix 8), and full species lists (Appendix 3).

## Key findings (by management factor)

- Mowing effect
  - Broad decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis (>40% since 2000) across all treatments, suggesting a site-level response (possible mowing homogenization, climate, or biotic changes).
  - Festuca rubra expands, particularly in more fertile (N and/or lime) plots.
  - Widespread expansion of bryophytes (mosses) linked to consistent mowing height (~6 cm) and possibly lack of grazing; moss expansion dampened somewhat by higher vascular productivity in fertile plots.
  - Functional shift: stress-tolerant (S) species gain in unimproved plots; competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and SR/CSR groups increase in fertilised plots; disturbance reduction appears to benefit stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated groups.
- Fertilisation effect (nitrogen and/or lime)
  - Sustained biomass productivity gain in fertilised plots; largest gains in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.
  - signs of possible productivity peak in highly fertilised plots, potentially linked to soil pH approaching ~7.0 and reduced soil moisture.
  - Lime raises soil pH significantly (to near 7 in upper soils); higher pH correlates with greater biomass in many plots, but the pH–biomass relationship varies by treatment (positive overall, but less pronounced or negative when both N and lime are applied).
  - Higher pH and lower moisture in fertilised plots associated with chlorosis symptoms in some areas.
  - Functional composition shifts: C-S-R species dominate more in N+L plots, while stress-tolerant species are favored in unimproved plots.
- Insecticide effect (Dursban 4 OPA)
  - Shannon diversity index highest in insecticide-treated plots, suggesting insect suppression may support more diverse plant communities, possibly via reduced herbivory and improved palatable plant establishment.
  - The article cautions that causality between insect control and diversity is not definitive without more direct herbivory data; findings align with literature showing complex plant–insect interactions.
- Trampling effect
  - In 2002, the C2 plots (first year of 13CO2 pulse experiments) show marked productivity reductions likely due to trampling during intensive experimental activity rather than treatment effects alone.
- Biodiversity and community structure (Point Analysis and diversity indices)
  - Point Analysis shows shifts in the abundance of common pasture-associated grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) in fertilised plots; unimproved plots show increased bryophyte frequency.
  - Shannon Diversity Index: 2002 shows a 15% decline in N&L plots relative to baseline, while other treatments show increases (up to 29% in some insecticide plots).
  - Bryophytes (especially Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increase across treatments, with the greatest proportional rise in unimproved plots; vascular bryophyte dynamics show species-level shifts linked to fertilisation and lime.
  - Functional group analysis (CSR framework): clear treatment-related differences by 2000–2002; N+L plots favor C-S-R and SR/CSR groups; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerators; SR/CSR is notably reduced in lime and insecticide plots.
- Biomass productivity trajectory
  - Long-term increase in biomass across treatments since 1999, but 2002 shows declines relative to 2001 in most treatments; greater productivity in N and/or lime plots persists.
  - Block geometry (slope) impacts productivity, with lower slope end showing greater relative gains in some years, indicating micro-topographic effects on productivity.

## Data quality, limitations and caveats

- Data gaps and reliability
  - 2002 weather station malfunction caused missing data during July–November; Konza station data substituted for the missing period to complete the records.
  - The C2 (trampling) subplot data collection began in 2002; first-time measurements may impact direct year-to-year comparisons.
  - Some outputs rely on 2002 point analysis, which included bryophyte identifications to species level for the first time, adding resolution and potential re-interpretation of past bryophyte trends.
- Cautions on attribution
  - Insecticide effects are self-contained within a complex ecological context; causality between reduced herbivory and diversity requires cautious interpretation.
  - Fertilisation and liming effects interact with soil moisture and pH; the magnitude and direction of biomass response may shift with changing moisture regimes.

## Implications and potential next steps (for data use and decision support)

- Data-informed management implications
  - Mowing, grazing exclusion, and nutrient additions drive plant community shifts; management should balance productivity with desired biodiversity outcomes.
  - Fertiliser strategies (especially N+L) yield the strongest biomass gains but may lead to reduced diversity over time; monitoring of moisture and pH is crucial to avoid stress symptoms and unintended ecological shifts.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity warrant further targeted studies linking herbivory pressure with plant community responses.
  - Trampling events during sampling campaigns can confound productivity measurements; ongoing trial designs should separate treatment effects from incidental disturbances.
- Data use recommendations
  - Maintain and expand standardized data collection (biomass, pH, moisture, species hits) across years to better model treatment interactions.
  - Use CSR and related functional classifications to interpret species turnover and to predict future community trajectories under varying disturbance and nutrient regimes.
  - Leverage PCA and diversity indices to track convergence or divergence of plots over time, informing adaptive management and data-driven policy decisions.
