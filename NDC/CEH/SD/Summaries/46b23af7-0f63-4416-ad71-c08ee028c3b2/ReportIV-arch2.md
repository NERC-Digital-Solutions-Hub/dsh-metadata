# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders), focusing on aboveground productivity, plant species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) within a large field experiment.
- Site management includes five treatments (Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide, and Control) across a block design, with mowing at ~6 cm, annual fertiliser applications, and insecticide application on designated plots. In 1999–2002, grazing was excluded by fencing; a trampling/13CO2 pulse component affected some plots in 2002.
- Data collected since 1999 encompass: automatic weather data, aboveground biomass by 0.5 m2 samples, periodic baseline and follow-up botanical surveys using point analysis, soil pH measurements, soil moisture, bryophyte and vascular plant inventories, and a detailed treatment map (Appendices).

## Treatments and Data Collection

- Site layout: Rigg Foot Experimental Site with 5 replicate blocks, each containing 6 main plots subdivided into sub-plots; 0.5 m2 sampling cells used for community surveys.
- Management tasks each year: universal mowing (~6 cm); insecticide application (Dursban 4 OPA) to designated plots; spring fertilisation with Nitrogen and/or Lime; a nitrogen-and-lime combination treatment.
- Data streams: weather station data; biomass harvests during May–Sept; 0.5 m2 point analyses in 2000–2002; soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture measurements; bryophyte and vascular plant inventories; 13CO2 pulse experiments in select years; extensive appendices documenting species lists and biomass.

## Key Findings

- Biomass and productivity
  - Overall biomass productivity rose across treatments from 1999 to 2002, but 2002 saw declines relative to 2001 in several treatments, with the steepest drops in the Control 2 plots.
  - Nitrogen and Lime together (N&L) produced the strongest productivity gains; lime or nitrogen alone yielded smaller increases; unfertilised plots showed the least productivity.
  - A clear slope effect: Block 1 (lower on slope) and Block 5 (upper) showed different magnitudes of biomass change, indicating spatial variation in productivity.

- Plant community composition and diversity
  - Mowing effects: Festuca rubra increased in more fertile plots, often at the expense of Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.; Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis declined, suggesting mowing selects for sward types more tolerant of cut regrowth.
  - Fertilisation effects: nutrient-rich plots shifted toward more competitive grass species (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and away from some unimproved pasture species; unimproved plots retained higher bryophyte dominance and dicot presence in relative terms.
  - Bryophyte expansion: Bryophytes, notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, increased across treatments, contributing to a higher bryophyte share of hits (and biomass in unimproved plots).
  - Insecticide effects: Shannon diversity (plant diversity) tended to be highest in insecticide-treated plots, suggesting reduced herbivory may help maintain diversity, though causal links remain interpretive.
  - Trampling effects: The C2 plots (with trampling associated with 13CO2 pulses) showed notable productivity reductions, indicating short-term disturbance can suppress growth.

- Functional group dynamics (CSR framework)
  - Unfertilised/unimproved plots favored stress-tolerant (S) species; fertilised plots (especially N&L) promoted competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) assemblages; lime and/or insecticide plots showed reduced SR/CSR representation.
  - Across years (2000–2002), CSR-based shifts became statistically detectable, with C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups increasingly prominent in fertilised plots, while stress-tolerant groups remained more influential in unimproved plots.

- Species-level and community structure changes
  - Point analysis indicated two pasture grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more abundant in fertilised plots, whereas unimproved plots remained dominated by Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Mosses and bryophytes increased notably in 2002, altering ground cover and biomass partitioning.
  - PCA of point analysis data separated improved vs unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots clustering together and some nitrogen-treated plots aligning with limed plots.

- Soil chemistry, moisture, and productivity linkages
  - Lime addition raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen had a smaller positive effect on pH.
  - A strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH was observed (higher pH associated with lower moisture), and a positive link between higher pH and biomass across treatments when all plots are considered collectively (though this relationship varied by treatment).
  - When examined within treatments, the pH–biomass relationship weakened or reversed in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime, suggesting a nonlinear, treatment-dependent interaction.

- Diversity and community metrics over time
  - Shannon diversity indices declined in Nitrogen & Lime plots by 2002 relative to other treatments, while other treatments showed relatively smaller increases or stability.
  - Bryophyte hits increased across years, particularly in unimproved plots; vascular plant hits showed shifts toward species associated with higher fertility in fertilised plots.

## Implications for Monitoring and Policy

- Management-driven ecological shifts are detectable in a standardized monitoring framework across multiple years, linking aboveground productivity, species composition, and functional traits to land-use practices (mowing, fertilisation, insecticides) and soil conditions.
- The CSR-based interpretation highlights how environmental stress, nutrients, and disturbance modulate plant functional groups, informing predictions of long-term biodiversity and productivity under different grassland management regimes.
- Data richness (biomass time series, point analyses, bryophyte tracking, soil chemistry, and weather) supports integrated environmental health assessment and policy evaluation over time.
- Ongoing monitoring is essential to discern long-term trajectories, particularly regarding nutrient saturation, soil pH elevation, bryophyte expansion, and potential diversity changes under sustained management.
