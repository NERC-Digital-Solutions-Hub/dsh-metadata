# SUMMARY

- Four-year overview of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition and diversity under five plot-level treatments and a site-level mowing regime.
- Treatments and design: 5 replicate blocks in downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots with randomized treatments, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; zero-grazing since 1998 with mowing to 6 cm; treatments include Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Insecticide (formerly Biocide) applied after mowing.
- Data collection and types (since 1998-2002):
  - Above-ground biomass: yearly 5 cut measurements per plot, dried and weighed; data summarized per plot and year.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline and annual 0.5 m2 point analyses (grid of 100 holes; 25 points touched by pin) to capture species presence and abundance; bryophytes identified to species in 2002; detailed Appendix 3 species lists.
  - Soil data: soil pH measurements at ~5 cm; soil moisture at corners of point-analysis cells (theta probe, 2002); regular soil sampling total counts and pH history.
  - Weather: on-site Automatic Weather Station data (rainfall, radiation, temperatures) since 1999; some missing data in 2002 due to equipment issues.
  - Site activity: documentation of mowing dates, treatment application dates and rates (Appendix 2); Field activity by multiple research groups, including 13CO2 pulses in Phase II plots (2002).
- Key findings (2002 data and cross-year trend):
  - Biomass productivity generally increased across treatments from 1999 to 2002, with the largest gains where both nitrogen and lime were applied; 2002 saw a drop in absolute biomass relative to 2001 across most treatments, with variable block effects (down-slope gradient influenced productivity).
  - Fertilization (N and/or lime) consistently raises productivity; lime raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in treated plots; nitrogen alone also raised pH modestly; combined N+L had strong biomass response but potentially reduced soil moisture and chlorosis in some plants.
  - Plant functional shifts: In fertilized plots (N and/or lime), competitive-type (C-S-R) species increased; stress-tolerant (S) species expanded in unimproved plots; SR/C-S-R taxa declined with lime and/or insecticide, indicating shifts in community strategy under altered disturbance and fertility.
  - Mowing effects: Reduced Agrostis spp. and promoted Festuca rubra in fertilized plots; overall moss expansion observed across the site, especially in plots with lower disturbance or higher sward height due to mowing and absence of grazing.
  - Insecticide treatment: Possible linkage between reduced herbivory and higher diversity indices, though causality is not definitively established from the data; data suggest a potential positive effect on certain palatable species under relatively infertile conditions.
  - Trampling effect: 2002 C2 plots (new sampling) showed reduced productivity likely due to trampling during 13CO2 pulse activities.
- Data products and accessibility:
  - Time-series data per plot-year for biomass (Appendix 6), cumulative biomass (Appendix 6), rank abundance and species hits per plot (Appendix 7 and Appendix 8), and species lists (Appendix 3).
  - Appendix 2 provides detailed treatment definitions, application rates, and dates.
  - Full site data available via Soil Biodiversity website and Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) contacts.

- Implications for data stewardship:
  - Longitudinal, multi-layered dataset with complex treatments and repeated measures; requires careful metadata, provenance, and versioning to support reuse and cross-year analyses.
  - Data harmonization needed across years (e.g., Biocide to Insecticide nomenclature) and across measurement types (biomass, species hits, bryophyte counts, soil chemistry, moisture, weather).
  - Notable data quality challenges include partial-year surveys (Control 2 missing in 2000-2001), weather-station data gaps in 2002, and occasional changes in measurement protocols; documentation is essential for reproducibility and audit trails.
  - Data access: primary metadata and primary results are detailed within the document and appendices; additional data and protocols available through the Soil Biodiversity website and CEH.
