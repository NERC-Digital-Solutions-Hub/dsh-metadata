# The influence of land-use management practices on species and functional biodiversity of nitrite oxidising bacteria and nitrification and denitrification processes

## Overview
- NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (1999) aimed to understand soil biodiversity and the functional roles of soil organisms in key ecological processes.
- 24 projects studied soil structure, carbon and nitrogen cycles, micro- and macro-fauna, to relate biodiversity to functional processes.

## Data collection and experimental design
- Focus on static chamber measurements of nitrous oxide (N2O) flux to assess nitrogen cycling under different land-management treatments.
- Treatments: Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Nitrogen & Lime; randomized block design with sampling areas S, T, U, V and sub-plots.
- Chambers placed on ridges (not in furrows) due to soil moisture differences; randomization determined by lowest available general sampling area for each replicate.
- Field period: May 2000 – Nov 2001; measurements conducted by CEH, Edinburgh.

## Chamber construction and deployment
- Chambers: 40 cm diameter, 20 cm length polypropylene tubes with PVC flanges and silicone seals.
- Gas sampling tube inserted ~15 cm; three-way PTFE valve used for sampling.
- Lids sealed to create gas-tight volume; lid volumes recorded and tracked.

## Gas analysis and measurement protocol
- N2O quantified from samples in Tedlar bags or 10 ml syringes using gas chromatography.
- GC system: Chrompak CP 9000 with Poropak Q column and electron capture detector (ECD); oven at 30°C, ECD at 350°C.
- Gas flow controlled (5 ml/min) with backflushing and pre-column cleanup to minimize water interference.
- Calibration standards (1 ppm N2O in N2/air mix) used at start and end of runs to convert signals to ppm.

## Experimental findings (key results)
- Liming increased gross nitrification rates compared with controls (approx. 1.6 μg N d⁻¹) and raised the nitric-to-nitrous oxide flux ratio.
- Nitrogen additions increased both nitric and nitrous oxide flux; however, gross nitrification rates in all N treatments declined relative to control and lime/nitrite treatments.
