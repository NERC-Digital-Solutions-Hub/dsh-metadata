# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- Comprehensive soil and vegetation data for Block 4 at Sourhope, including a detailed soil profile, chemical analyses, auger samples, vegetation surveys, and an ecotron plot dataset.
- Demonstrates standardised, multi-parameter environmental monitoring at a site level, with explicit horizon descriptions, laboratory measurements, and metadata.

## Soil profile and horizons (Block 4)

- Profile description and horizons (depths in cm):
  - LF (0–1): Fibrous, moist, no mineral grains; smooth boundary.
  - FH (1–4): Semi-fibrous, moist; abundant very fine roots; sharp boundary.
  - H (4–8): Black matrix colour; amorphous; weak blocky structure; roots present.
  - Ah (8–29): Dark reddish brown; sandy silt loam; friable; abundant roots; mineral stones present; boundary to AB.
  - Abg (29–40): Pinkish grey with mottles; coarse sandy silt loam; mixed mottling; stones present; boundary to Bsg.
  - B sg (40–61): Brown; sandy silt loam; mottles; blocky structure; stones present.
  - C gx (61–95): Reddish brown to brown; sandy clay loam; mottles; massive to platy structure; abundant small igneous stones.
  - (Further horizons beyond 95 cm described in a consistent mineral profile framework.)
- Lithology and drainage context:
  - Profiles show an inheritance from igneous parent material with abundant igneous stones in subsoil horizons.
  - Transition from upper horizons with loamy textures to deeper horizons with more pronounced mottling and reduced conditions.

## Soil chemistry and physical/chemical properties (Block 4)

- Selected horizon data (representative values, per horizon):
  - N and C: %N values range around 0.4–2.1; %C values high in surface horizons (e.g., FH ~38% at Block 4); C:N ratios reflect increasing organic content in upper horizons.
  - C:N ratio: General trend from ~12–20 across horizons, with higher values in finer, organic-rich horizons.
  - Exchangeable cations: Ca typically highest in near-surface horizons; Mg and K present at lower to moderate levels; Na generally low or below detection in several horizons.
  - Moisture and organic content: %Moisture loss (loss-on-ignition related) elevated in surface horizons (e.g., LOI values >60% in some surface samples) indicating substantial organic matter; pH values show acidity:
    - pH(H2O) typically around 4.5–5.0 in surface horizons, slightly higher in some deeper horizons.
    - pH(CaCl2) generally in the 3.5–4.5 range, reflecting acidic conditions.
  - Other metrics: %Moisture loss and LOI indicate high organic matter content in upper horizons; Ca, Mg, K, and other cations show horizon-dependent variation linked to drainage and parent material.
- Interpretation highlights:
  - Acidic, organic-rich upper horizons with considerable LOI and high organic carbon near the surface.
  - Cation chemistry shows calcium dominance in many upper horizons, with variation across blocks tied to microtopography and drainage differences.
  - Soil properties exhibit block- and horizon-level heterogeneity consistent with microrelief, drainage patterns, and parent material.

## Auger samples (Block 4)

- Auger sampling depths: 0–30 cm (LF to Ah/Abg transitions) and additional horizon-specific samples (A table of A–F cores).
- Key observed metrics per sample:
  - %N: typically around 0.4–2.0 across horizons.
  - %C: wide range, with surface samples showing higher values in organic-rich horizons.
  - C:N ratios: generally in the mid-to-high range, reflecting organic matter content and decomposition stage.
  - Ca, K, Mg, Na: Ca often highest among cations in surface horizons; other cations show horizon- and block-dependent variation.
  - %Moisture loss and LOI: elevated in surface horizons, indicating organic matter content; LOI values commonly in the tens of percent for near-surface horizons.
  - pH: acidic across horizons, with pH(H2O) around 4.5–5.0 and pH(CaCl2) around 3.8–4.5 in several horizons.
- Data structure:
  - Individual auger samples are barcoded and labeled (e.g., 4A–4F) with corresponding chemical and physical measurements, enabling horizon-level comparisons and site-wide aggregation.

## Vegetation survey (Block 4)

- Plot-level vegetation inventories (plots 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F) with species counts by subplot.
- Dominant and indicator species:
  - Dominant grasses include Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta.
  - Indicator species and edge/Interior patterns observed, with some species more prevalent on edges or moister blocks.
- Data format:
  - Species totals per subplot/plot, enabling assessment of community composition and habitat associations within Block 4.
  - Assemblage patterns reflect a grass-dominated meadow/grassland community with variability across blocks and microhabitats.

## Ecotron plot (Block 4)

- ECOTRON PLOT: soil analysis and vegetation survey for a controlled experimental area.
- Soil analyses (ECOTRON PLOT):
  - Wt around 6.1 mg; %N ~0.59; %C ~8.22; C:N ~13.83; Ca ~2.76 meq/100g; Mg ~1.7 meq/100g; pH(H2O) ~4.79; pH CaCl2 ~3.82.
- Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT):
  - Subplots A–F with counts for various species and overall species totals; data enable comparisons between managed/ecotron conditions and surrounding field conditions.

## Block 5 context and data (Block 5)

- Site details (Block 5):
  - Grid reference NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5 degrees; imperfect drainage.
  - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material includes undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
- Soil profile (Block 5):
  - Multiple horizons (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with detailed descriptions and boundary types.
  - Horizon-by-horizon data include %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH CaCl2.
- Auger samples (Block 5):
  - Auger cores 5A–5F with horizon-level measurements for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH.
- Vegetation survey (Block 5):
  - Subplots within plots 5A and 5B–5F with species totals and tallied counts for A, B, C, D, E, F subplots.
- Data structure and intent:
  - Similar to Block 4, Block 5 provides complementary site data for cross-block comparisons, enabling landscape-scale monitoring across multiple soil and vegetation regimes.

## Data management, provenance and governance (implied across the document)

- Data provenance:
  - Barcoded soil samples, horizon-specific analyses, and plot-level vegetation surveys create traceable records for each sample and plot.
- Metadata and archiving:
  - Detailed horizon descriptions, soil chemistry, and vegetation data are archived with horizon-level metadata, enabling reproducibility and longitudinal comparisons.
- Data sharing and openness:
  - The data appear to be part of a structured field dataset designed for integration into longer-term monitoring networks (e.g., ECN) and comparability across blocks.
- Governance implications for monitoring frameworks:
  - Demonstrates the need for standardized metadata, consistent horizon description, and transparent data lineage to support policy evaluation and decision-making.
  - Highlights the value of integrating site-scale datasets with larger monitoring networks and ensuring traceability through barcodes and structured data formats.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation

- The document exemplifies a long-term, integrated monitoring approach combining soil profiles, soil chemistry, and vegetation surveys at fine spatial resolution.
- It illustrates practical data governance challenges and solutions, including:
  - Data provenance and metadata completeness for verifying data quality and suitability for decision-making.
  - Handling heterogeneity across blocks and ensuring consistent data collection and horizon descriptions.
  - Balancing openness with field realities, while enabling public sharing of underlying data where appropriate.
- The connection to external monitoring networks (ECN) demonstrates how site-scale datasets can be coordinated with broader environmental change research to inform policy and management decisions.
