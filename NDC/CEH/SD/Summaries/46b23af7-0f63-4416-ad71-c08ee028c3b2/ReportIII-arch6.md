# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context
  - Large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to provide broad monitoring context for detailed studies; baseline data from 1998; findings organized to facilitate cross-year comparisons and links to other data.
  - Measurements and dates summarized in Table 1; site management impacted by two 2001 events: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May 2001) and a change of Officer in Charge.

- Key measurement program and management notes
  - Automatic Weather Station data collected on site; regularly fed to data manager.
  - Main summer measurements included five above-ground biomass harvests per year; biomass dried and weighed; data transformed for analysis.
  - Botanical composition tracked via Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) with cross-checks between surveyors.
  - 2001 field period affected by FMD restrictions but field activities largely resumed under veterinary and site protocols; first biocide application in May 2001 was missed, others completed.
  - A shift in personnel and a switch from manual to mechanical cutting in 2001 likely influenced biomass estimates.

- 2. Results
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to previous years; slightly cooler average temperatures; higher soil moisture than 1999–2000.
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear treatment hierarchy: nitrogen (N) and/or lime (L) additions increased biomass relative to unimproved plots.
    - Peak biomass consistently in July/August each year; 2001 biomass higher overall than 1999–2000, likely due to personnel change and switch to mechanical cutting.
    - Normalised to C1 to compare treatment effects; ANOVA shows significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant Year × Treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
    - When comparing along years, biomass responses indicate lasting positive effects of N and/or L, with greatest response in plots receiving both N and L.
  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime application raised surface pH (0–5 cm) to about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in N&L plots by Oct 2001.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent; control plots showed little change since baseline (Aug 1998).
  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 survey showed 58% more total species “hits” than 2000 across all treatments, suggesting increased sward density (possibly from past grazing removal in 1998).
    - Treatment differences in most frequent species: Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001; Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased and were most common in fertilised plots (especially N & L); Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra common in improved plots.
    - Species richness: unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) had 24 species, while N/L plots had 18, suggesting potential slight decline in diversity with strongest fertility improvements.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots tended to include more bryophytes and acid-tolerant species (e.g., Agrostis vinealis, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
    - Biomass correlations: higher biomass associated with increases in Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; relative abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass increased.
    - Litter accumulation and turnover increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

- 3. Site heterogeneity
  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity noted: columns E and F tended to be more acidic; this pattern may be amplified by higher proportions of unimproved or biocide-treated plots in those columns.
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
    - Biomass tended to be lower in outlying plots and higher in more centrally located plots; strong positive correlation observed between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant differences in biomass among blocks, supporting the treatment-driven pattern across the site.

- Data interpretation and implications for data use
  - The dataset provides robust, multi-year context for assessing how N and lime management influence biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community composition under field conditions.
  - Strong evidence that N and/or lime enhance productivity and shift species composition toward more productive grasses (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis), with associated increases in litter turnover and biomass correlations.
  - Spatial heterogeneity should be considered in analyses; pH and biomass show clear spatial patterns across the site.
  - Data quality is supported by cross-surveyor agreement in the botanical surveys and documented management events; 2001 disruptions are acknowledged and described.

- Data products and references for users
  - Measurements and results are presented in structured formats (Sections 2.1–2.4; 3; Appendices), with Tables 4–6 and Figures 1–9 detailing biomass, pH, species composition, ANOVA results, and PCA outcomes.
  - Key species and habitat indicators are listed (e.g., Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum, bryophytes).
  - Appendix 1 provides annualised above-ground biomass per plot.
