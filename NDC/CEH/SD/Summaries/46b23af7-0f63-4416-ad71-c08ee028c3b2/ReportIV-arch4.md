# SUMMARY

- Overview
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders), focused on linking soil biodiversity with above-ground plant productivity and diversity, through a large, fenced field experiment.
  - The site includes five replicate blocks with multiple plot- and sub-plot treatments to study mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and lime), and insecticide effects, alongside a broader aim to understand management-driven changes in both plant communities and soil biota.

- Experimental design and data assets
  - Location and structure: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells used for data collection.
  - Treatments: five plot-level factors (Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime) and an Insecticide treatment; site-level mowing to ~6 cm; insecticide is Dursban 4 OPA; fertilisation applied in spring; lime applied annually.
  - Data types and collection cadence:
    - Above-ground biomass: regular harvests (May–Sept) using 0.5 m^2 samples; biomass dried and weighed; data collected since 1999 with five cuts per summer.
    - Weather data: on-site Automatic Weather Station since February 1999; includes rainfall, radiation, temperatures.
    - Soil and pH: soil pH measured at ~5 cm depth in center of plots annually; soil moisture measured in 2002 in point-analysis cells.
    - Vegetation surveys: baseline survey in 1998; subsequent point analysis surveys in 2000, 2001, 2002 using a 100-hole grid per 0.5 m^2 cell; bryophytes identified to finer taxonomic level in 2002.
    - Additional surveys: micro-scale vegetation cover, biomass sorting, and disturbance-related plots were conducted under various project activities.
    - Total data collected: 11,621 soil samples up to 2002; multiple project-specific datasets and appendices detailing species lists and treatment summaries.
  - Data access and documentation: detailed project information available on the Soil Biodiversity website; contact CEH for further data; site activity summaries and appendices provide extensive metadata (Appendices 1–8).

- Key findings by treatment and management impact
  - Mowing effect
    - Consistent decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across treatments; possible site-level factor (mowing regime, loss of grazing) rather than a single treatment cause.
    - Festuca rubra expands in more fertile, lime- and/or nitrogen-enhanced plots; bryophyte expansion observed with regular mowing and reduced disturbance.
    - Moss proliferation linked to ~6 cm sward height and absence of grazing; bryophyte increase contributes to overall plant community shifts, particularly in unimproved plots.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Nitrogen and/or lime addition increases above-ground productivity, with the strongest gains in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.
    - Soil pH in lime-treated plots approaches ~7.0; higher pH linked to reduced soil moisture in some plots; potential stress signals (chlorosis) observed in lime-rich plots during 2002.
    - Functional community shift: increased C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderals) species in N+L plots; stress-tolerant (S) species gain in unimproved plots; interaction with pH and moisture is central to productivity dynamics.
  - Insecticide effect
    - Shannon diversity index higher in insecticide-treated plots, though causality to reduced herbivory is not definitively established; potential indirect benefits for palatable species under relatively infertile conditions.
    - Findings align with past studies suggesting insect herbivory dynamics can influence plant diversity, but exact mechanisms require more evidence in this system.
  - Trampling effect
    - In 2002, C2 plots showed sharp productivity declines, likely due to trampling during Periods of intensive sampling and labelled CO2 pulses; operational disturbances can confound treatment effects.

- Functional groups and community structure
  - Dominant functional group patterns: three main groupings—stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR and SR/CSR combinations); these three groups accounted for most plant hits per plot.
  - Trends by treatment:
    - Nitrogen and Lime plots show a rise in C-S-R species due to improved growth conditions and higher soil pH.
    - Unimproved plots favor stress-tolerant species; SR/C-S-R species decline with lime and insecticide treatments.
  - Point analysis and PCA indicate a consistent separation between improved (fertilised) and unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots showing distinct vegetation characteristics.

- Data quality, limitations, and interpretation notes
  - 2002 weather station issue caused data loss for a ~6-week period; nearby Konza station data used to fill gaps where appropriate.
  - Annual and cross-year comparisons rely on 1999–2002 data; some plots (e.g., Control 2) showed altered sampling patterns and site-wide disturbances.
  - Analyses employed include split-plot ANOVA (to assess Treatment, Year, and interactions) and PCA on point-analysis data to explore species groupings and treatment effects.
  - Appendices provide comprehensive metadata, including site map, species lists, biomass time series, and rank analyses by treatment.

- Implications for data governance and ongoing use
  - The study generates rich, multi-layered datasets linking management actions to plant productivity and community structure, integrated with soil chemistry and microhabitat data.
  - For data-leadership purposes, key considerations include maintaining metadata completeness, ensuring long-term discoverability, and documenting treatment histories (e.g., exact timing and rates of N, lime, and insecticide applications).
  - Data generated by multiple projects across phases I and II (including labelled CO2 pulses and trace-gas measurements) highlight opportunities for cross-project data integration and community of practice in soil biodiversity and plant–soil feedback research.
  - Availability: primary data and detailed methodologies are described in the published report and on the Soil Biodiversity website; further data requests can be directed to CEH Windermere Road.

- Endnotes and resources
  - Core methodologies and results are presented in the 2002 report and appendices, including detailed treatment summaries, species lists, and site-activity logs.
  - References and appendices provide context for functional-type classifications (CSR framework) and prior related studies relevant to plant–insect interactions and disturbance regimes.
