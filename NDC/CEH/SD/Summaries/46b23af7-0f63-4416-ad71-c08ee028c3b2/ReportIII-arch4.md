# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview and context
- Large, long-running field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide context for detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons; baseline data described in the 1998 Baseline Data Survey.
- 1999–2001 data collection continued under site management plans; 2001 management included Foot and Mouth restrictions and a change of officer in charge.

## Data collection and measurement methods
- Automatic Weather Station: headline measures (rainfall, radiation, temperatures at multiple heights, soil moisture) collected and downloaded regularly.
- Above-ground biomass: five summer harvests (May–Sept); mowing to ~6 cm; clippings dried and weighed; results normalized to a reference plot (C1) for cross-year comparison; ln-transformations used for ANOVAs.
- Soil pH: measurements of the top 0–5 cm; lime increased pH substantially; N addition raised pH modestly; controls remained baseline.
- Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys in July (25-cell frames) with 0.5 m2 sampling cells; 2000 and 2001 surveys used; species hits used to derive relative abundance; PCA used to explore community shifts.
- Other measurements: mini-rhizotron-related surveys and sub-plot surveys; weather data integrated into site data management.
- Data management and analysis: data managed by CEH, with cross-year normalization (C1), and analyses including ANOVA (split-plot), and PCA for species association.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Treatments: Control 1 (C1), Control 2 (C2), Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Biocide (B) – six treatments arranged in blocks across plots.
- Management impacts: 2001 saw a switch from manual mowing to mechanical shears; one biocide application was missed due to FMD restrictions.
- Inter-year comparability supported by standardized measurement scheduling (Table 1 data collection) and by normalizing biomass to C1.

## Key results by domain

### Weather (2001)
- Rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture content somewhat higher than in earlier years.

### Above-ground biomass
- Treatments showed a consistent hierarchy in biomass production across the season, with peaks in July/August.
- 2001 biomass higher than previous years, likely due to personnel changes and switch to mechanical cutting.
- Normalizing all treatments to C1 revealed: nitrogen and/or lime treatments most effectively promoted biomass; significant differences between improved vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction (and limited block effects).

### Soil pH
- Lime raised surface pH in October 2001 (6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in N&L plots).
- Nitrogen addition also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots remained near baseline.

### Botanical composition
- 2001 survey showed no significant surveyor differences.
- Overall, total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting increased sward density (likely from reduced grazing since 1998).
- Species-level changes by treatment: Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments; Festuca spp. increased and were most associated with fertilized plots; improved pastures showed more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in controls.
- Species richness: unimproved plots contained 24 species vs 18 in improved plots (potential early sign of diversity decline with fertility enhancements).
- Multivariate analysis (PCA) indicated clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime treatments from controls/biocide; biomass correlated positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis and negatively with certain bryophytes and less fertile-associated species.
- Litter incidence increased with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F tended to be more acidic, with lower pH measures in N and/or Lime plots, suggesting underlying spatial pattern.
- Biomass distribution showed higher values in more central plots; a strong positive correlation existed between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant block-level biomass differences.

## Data quality, limitations, and methodological notes
- 2001 measurement change (switch to mechanical shears) likely influenced biomass estimates relative to 1999–2000.
- FMD-related access restrictions caused temporary reductions in field activity and one missed biocide application.
- Inter-observer reliability checks for Point Quadrat surveys showed no significant differences between surveyors in 2001.
- The study relies on cross-year normalization (C1) and robust statistical methods (ANOVA, PCA) to interpret treatment effects amidst site heterogeneity.

## Implications for data leadership and management
- Importance of documenting protocol changes (cutting method, access restrictions) for long-term data comparability.
- Use of normalization strategies (e.g., C1) to facilitate cross-year analyses.
- Necessity of metadata on spatial structure (blocks, slope columns) to interpret treatment effects and site heterogeneity.
- Integration of multi-source data (biomass, pH, species composition) with multivariate analyses (PCA) to derive system-level insights.
- Emphasis on data provenance, consistent data collection schedules, and explicit acknowledgement of events (e.g., FMD) that affect data continuity.
