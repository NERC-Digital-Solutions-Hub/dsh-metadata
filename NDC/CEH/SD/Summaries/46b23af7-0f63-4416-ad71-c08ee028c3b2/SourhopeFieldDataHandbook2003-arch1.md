## Implications for data users and analysts

- Multi-level structure provides rich opportunities for correlating soil properties with vegetation responses across blocks, horizons, and plots.
- Clear patterns emerge:
  - Surface horizons are organic-rich with high LOI and C, but become more mineral and acidic with depth.
  - Exchangeable base cations (especially Ca) are higher in the upper horizons and decline with depth, with pH remaining acidic to mildly acidic across extracts.
  - Depth-linked gradients (Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) show systematic decreases in organic matter and nutrients with depth, yet retain measurable Ca and Mg in deeper horizons in some blocks.
- Data quality and use considerations
  - Some heterogeneity exists across blocks and subplots; extrapolation to unsampled areas should be cautioned.
  - The dataset includes comprehensive metadata (weights, horizon designations, depths, boundary types) and archiving of samples, which supports reproducibility and longitudinal analyses.
  - Vegetation data are patchy in places but provide a basis for linking soil physical/chemical gradients to plant community composition and productivity.
- Analytical opportunities
  - Develop correlations between C:N, LOI, pH, and exchangeable cations across horizons to model nutrient availability and organic matter dynamics.
  - Construct predictive site models for soil fertility and acidification trends under different horizon strata and land-use scenarios.
  - Use ECOTRON data to compare controlled-environment responses with field measurements, supporting experiments on soil-plant-microbial interactions.
