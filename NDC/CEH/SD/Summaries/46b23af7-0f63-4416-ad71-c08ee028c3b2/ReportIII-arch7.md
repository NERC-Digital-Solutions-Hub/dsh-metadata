# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Purpose and scope
  - Intensive, long-term field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to monitor broad context data to support more detailed investigations, with data types and measurement dates aligned to Report II for comparability.
  - Key measurements include automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition; plus documentation of site heterogeneity.

- Site and management context
  - Location: Sourhope field site, MLURI, Sourhope, Yetholm, Roxburghshire.
  - 2001 administrative changes and events:
    - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May 2001) limited site visits; protocols implemented for sampling thereafter.
    - Officer in Charge changed in May 2001.
  - Data collection framework and schedule detailed (Table 1) with multiple campaigns across 1999–2001.

- Data collection and methods (highlights)
  - Above-ground productivity: five mowing periods per year; 0.5 m2 sampling cells within sub-plots S/T/U/V across plots; biomass dried and weighed.
  - Botanical surveys: July 2001 Point Quadrat surveys (grid of 100 cells; ~25 pins per cell) for species hits; same protocol as 2000.
  - Vegetation surveys also included directed minirhizotron and disturbance/nutrient plots (on behalf of related projects).
  - Soil and pH: pH measured at 0–5 cm; lime and nitrogen treatments tracked; Automatic Weather Station on-site for continuous weather data.
  - Experimental design: blocks and plots with various treatments including Control, Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen+Lime (N&L), and Biocide; data analyzed with split-plot ANOVA and PCA.

- 2. Results
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather: rainfall near long-term average after a very wet year; total radiation stable; slightly cooler average temperatures; soil moisture modestly higher than prior years.
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Treatment hierarchy observed consistently; peak biomass typically in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass substantially higher than 2000, likely due to staffing changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Normalised biomass against C1 yearly to examine treatment effects; nitrogen and/or lime had the strongest positive influence on productivity.
    - ANOVA: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant block differences.
  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime raised surface pH (0–5 cm) to about 6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in Nitrogen+Lime plots (N&L); nitrogen alone also raised pH but less so.
    - Control plots' pH remained close to baseline (1998).
  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 survey (compared with 2000) showed clear treatment-driven shifts in species abundance.
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments; Festuca spp. (ovalina and rubra) increased across treatments.
    - Improved plots (especially those with N and/or Lime) showed more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
    - Diversity: unimproved plots harbored 24 species; improved (N&L or N) plots had 18 species, suggesting potential early decline in diversity with higher fertility.
    - Multivariate patterns (PCA): improved plots cluster separately from control/biocide; nitrogen and/or lime plots show more extreme species associations (e.g., stronger alignment with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis).
    - Biomass correlation: higher above-ground biomass links to greater relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; lower abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophyte-rich assemblages with increasing biomass.
    - Litter increase observed in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

- 3. Site heterogeneity
  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity noted; columns E and F showed comparatively more acidic plots, likely due to a higher proportion of Controls/Biocide treatments in those columns.
    - Underlying spatial patterns in pH across the site affect community composition.
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass values varied by plot location; central plots tended to have higher biomass (e.g., N&L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant biomass differences between blocks (statistical result: F-statistic not significant for blocks).

- Overall interpretation for GIS use
  - The dataset provides a georeferenced, multi-temporal view of how nutrient additions and liming influence biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community structure.
  - Spatial heterogeneity shows the importance of plot location within the site for both soil chemistry and biomass outcomes.
  - Key data products for map-based GIS visualization:
    - Biomass heatmaps by plot/block and by year (1999–2001).
    - Soil pH maps at the 0–5 cm depth, by treatment and over time.
    - Species distribution maps derived from point quadrat hits, highlighting shifts between unimproved vs improved plots.
    - PCA-derived ordination outputs (Axis 1/Axis 2 scores) to visualize treatment-driven community composition across space.
    - Correlation surfaces linking biomass to pH and to relative abundance of key species (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis).
  - Data caveats for GIS work:
    - 2001 sampling interrupted by FMD but followed by protocol-compliant resumption.
    - Biomass estimates in 2001 may reflect changes in measurement method (switch to mechanical shears); analyses normalize against C1 to mitigate this.
    - Diversity indices show potential early declines in plots with higher fertility; interpretation should consider sampling intensity and plot-level heterogeneity.
