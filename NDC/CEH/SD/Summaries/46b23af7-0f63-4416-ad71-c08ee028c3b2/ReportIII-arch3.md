# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- A large field experiment as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) to provide broad monitoring context for detailed studies.
- A baseline Monitoring Plan (1998) guided measurements across multiple domains to aid cross-study comparisons and year-to-year linkages.
- Key measured domains include above-ground biomass, soil pH, botanical composition, and weather data from an Automatic Weather Station; data are intended for integration, QA, and governance with clear data provenance.

## Purpose and Monitoring Context

- Objectives: identify environmental health measures to scrutinise and evaluate policy decisions and inform future management; provide context for other research groups and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Site management: maintained under a Site Management Plan; 2001 management affected by external events (Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions) and a change in site leadership.
- Monitoring scope: includes physical outputs (biomass), chemical soil status (pH), vegetation composition, and weather to contextualize plant and soil responses to treatments.

## Methods and Monitoring Framework

- Experimental design: field trial with multiple sub-plots and treatments to test nutrient and management effects (examples include Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen + Lime, Biocide, plus unimproved controls).
- Measurements and timing (as per Table 1 and Table 2): 
  - Above-ground biomass harvested five times during each summer; dried and weighed; data summed annually and ln-transformed for analyses.
  - Soil pH measured in the top 5 cm at baseline (Aug 1998) and follow-up (Oct 2001).
  - Botanical composition assessed using Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001 mirroring 2000 protocol); species hits recorded to derive relative abundances and diversity.
  - Weather data collected continuously via Automatic Weather Station; data transmitted to the Data Manager.
- Data processing: 
  - Treatments contrasted using split-plot ANOVA; biomass data ln-transformed to meet assumptions.
  - PCA applied to Point Quadrat data to examine treatment-related shifts in plant communities.
  - Normalization of biomass by reference plot (C1) to isolate treatment effects and year-to-year changes.
- Data integrity and provenance:
  - Documentation of field activities, mowing methods (manual vs mechanical), and personnel changes that could affect measurements.
  - Efforts to ensure comparability across years, with explicit notes on potential confounders (e.g., changes in mowing technique coinciding with biomass increases in 2001).

## Key Findings

- Weather and site conditions
  - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; total radiation similar to prior years.
  - 2001 temperatures slightly lower; higher soil moisture than 2000.

- Above-ground biomass
  - Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass production with nitrogen and/or lime generally increasing biomass relative to controls.
  - 2001 saw substantial biomass increases vs. 2000, partly attributed to personnel changes and shift from manual to mechanical mowing.
  - Biomass analyses show significant differences between improved (N and/or L) versus unimproved plots; significant year-by-treatment interactions; blocks not a major source of variation.

- Soil pH
  - Liming consistently raised surface soil pH; October 2001 values: limed plots ~6.19; Nitrogen & Lime plots ~6.38.
  - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots remained near baseline pH since Aug 1998.

- Botanical composition
  - 2001 Point Quadrat surveys showed higher total hits (greater plant density) across treatments than 2000.
  - Species shifts by treatment: Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased; improved plots (N and/or Lime) favored Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Diversity trends: unimproved plots harbored more species (about 24) than improved plots (about 18), suggesting potential early diversity decline with higher fertility.
  - Multivariate analyses (PCA) indicate clear separation of improved versus unimproved plots; litter incidence increased with nitrogen and/or lime, reflecting faster turnover with higher soil fertility.
  - Biomass correlates with species composition: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively associated with biomass; certain bryophytes and Nardus stricta tend to decline as biomass increases.

- Site heterogeneity
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: right-hand columns tended to have more acidic plots; some columns (notably with unimproved treatments) showed lower pH values.
  - Biomass variation showed a spatial pattern, with higher cumulative biomass in more central plots.
  - Positive correlation detected between surface soil pH and biomass, though biomass differences between blocks were not statistically significant.

## Data Management, Standards, and Governance Implications

- Data quality and metadata
  - The study emphasized rigorous data collection protocols, cross-year comparability, and transparent documentation of field procedures and personnel changes.
  - Metadata completeness is crucial for verifying data suitability for policy use and cross-study comparisons.
- Data accessibility and sharing
  - The report exemplifies comprehensive data disclosure (location, timing, processing steps) but also highlights the broader governance challenge of publicly sharing underlying data, which the monitoring framework seeks to address through clear governance processes.
- Data transformation and integration
  - The need to normalize across years and account for methodological changes (e.g., mowing method) to avoid confounding treatment effects.
  - Use of multivariate methods (PCA) and ANOVA demonstrates an approach to integrate diverse data streams (biomass, pH, species composition, weather) into policy-relevant indicators.
- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates the value of combining structural (treatment design) and ecological (biomass, pH, composition) indicators to monitor environmental health.
  - Highlights the importance of accounting for site heterogeneity and external events (FMD, staff changes) in monitoring plans and interpretation of results.
  - Underlines the necessity of maintaining robust data governance, open data practices, and clear documentation to support policy scrutiny and future decision making.

## Operational Context and Outputs

- 2001 field year context: FMD-related access restrictions January–May; post-restriction sampling conducted under protocol; first biocide application delayed but subsequent applications completed.
- Resource and personnel changes: new Officer in Charge in 2001; potential impacts on measurement consistency (noted and addressed via normalization and documentation).
- Outputs suitable for policy and monitoring use:
  - Quantitative measures: above-ground biomass by treatment and year; soil pH by treatment; species abundance by treatment; litter turnover indicators.
  - Analytical outputs: ANOVA tables (Tables 4–5), PCA results (Figure 5), correlations between biomass and species composition (Figure 6), and visualizations of biomass and pH trends (Figures 1–3, 7–9).
  - Data collection schedule and methods documented (Tables 1–3, Appendix 1).

## Conclusion for Monitoring Frameworks

- The Sourhope report provides a multi-metric, longitudinal view of how grid treatments (nutrients, lime, biocide) influence biomass production, soil chemistry, and plant community structure under field conditions.
- It demonstrates the need for integrated monitoring approaches that capture treatment effects, spatial heterogeneity, and temporal dynamics, while maintaining rigorous data governance, clear metadata, and transparent data processing practices to support policy evaluation and decision making.
