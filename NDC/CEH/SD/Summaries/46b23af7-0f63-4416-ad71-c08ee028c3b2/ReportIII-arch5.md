# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and purpose
  - Large-scale field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed at providing a broad context of measurements to accompany detailed studies, enabling cross-year comparisons and links to other data.
  - Documented data collection, management, and outcomes to support data users and governance.

- Data collected and formats
  - Automatic Weather Station
    - 1999–2001: headline measures including rainfall, radiation, air and soil temperatures, and soil moisture.
    - Managed via automatic downloads and centralized data management (CEH/Macauley MLURI data manager).
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Five mowing occasions per summer (May–Sept) across plots with treatments: Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime, Biocide.
    - 0.5 m2 sampling cells within sub-plots; biomass dried and totalled annually; ln-transformed for analysis.
  - Soil pH
    - Upper 5 cm measured; lime increased pH (6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in N+L plots; nitrogen alone also raised pH modestly).
  - Botanical composition
    - Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001; same protocol as 2000) with approximately 50% of quadrats per surveyor to test inter-surveyor consistency.
    - Species hits recorded; PCA used to examine community shifts; detailed species abundance by treatment.
  - Data collection schedule and data management
    - Table-based site activity and measurement dates documented; weather data linked to data managers; ongoing data archiving and provenance tracked.
  - Documentation and codes
    - Species codes and data interpretation guidelines (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris; Fr = Festuca rubra; etc.) provided for consistency.

- Management context and events (2001)
  - Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions (Feb–May 2001) limited site access; monitoring and sampling adapted under vet-approved protocol.
  - Change of site officer in May 2001; management plan continued with adjusted procedures.
  - First biocide application in May 2001 missed; subsequent applications completed.

- Key findings by data type
  - Weather
    - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to prior years; slight decrease in average temperature; higher soil moisture than 2000.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Consistent treatment hierarchy across years; peak biomass in July/August.
    - 2001 showed substantial biomass increase vs 2000, likely due to personnel changes and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Nitrogen and Lime (especially N+L) most effectively boosted biomass; normalized against C1 to compare years.
  - Soil pH
    - Lime raised surface pH; nitrogen alone raised pH less; control plots remained largely stable since baseline (1998).
  - Botanical composition
    - 2001: total number of hits 58% higher than 2000, suggesting denser sward, possibly due to 1998 grazing removal.
    - Treatment effects: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis more abundant in fertilised/improved plots; Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments.
    - Diversity: unimproved plots (Control/Biocide) had 24 species; improved (N, L, N+L) had 18 species, indicating potential decline in diversity with improved fertility.
    - PCA: clear separation of improved vs unimproved plots; dominance shifts toward F. rubra, Poa pratensis, and related species in improved plots; unimproved plots linked with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
    - Biomass correlation: higher biomass linked with increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; decline in other species as biomass rises; more litter observed in N and/or Lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
  - Community and biomass relations
    - PCA and species-biomass correlations show a trajectory from less fertile (diverse but lower biomass) toward more productive, sward-dense communities with N and/or Lime input.

- Site heterogeneity and its implications
  - Spatial variation: columns E and F on the hillside tended to be more acidic; central plots generally yielded higher biomass.
  - Soil pH and biomass: strong positive correlation across plots; no significant block-level biomass difference, underscoring spatial heterogeneity as a governance and analysis consideration.

- Data quality and provenance
  - Inter-surveyor reliability: no significant difference between surveyors in 2001; supports data consistency for the botanical survey.
  - Data processing and analysis notes: use of log transformation for biomass; ANOVA and PCA used to derive treatment effects and community patterns.
  - Documentation quality: comprehensive metadata (dates, protocols, mowing regimes, sampling methods) to support reproducibility and cross-study linking.

- Data governance implications for Data Stewards
  - Metadata completeness: ensure clear recording of mowing methods (manual vs mechanical), personnel changes, FMD-related access restrictions, and treatment designs for cross-year comparability.
  - Provenance and lineage: maintain links between baseline (1998) and subsequent years; document any protocol adjustments due to site-wide events.
  - Data harmonization: maintain consistent data schemas across years (e.g., biomass measurements, pH, species codes, PCA outputs) to enable robust multi-year analyses.
  - Access and sharing: provide clear data dictionaries (treatment codes, species codes) and linkages to centralized data managers; capture any data quality flags arising from field disruptions.
  - Interpretation considerations: account for site heterogeneity (spatial clustering of pH and biomass) when aggregating data; normalization (e.g., to a reference plot like C1) aids cross-year comparisons.
  - Biodiversity vs productivity trade-offs: when sharing, highlight the observed shift toward higher biomass associated with fertility treatments and corresponding changes in species diversity and composition.
