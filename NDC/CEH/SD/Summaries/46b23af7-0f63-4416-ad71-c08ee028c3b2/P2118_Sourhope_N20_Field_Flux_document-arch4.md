# The influence of land-use management practices on species and functional biodiversity of nitrite oxidising bacteria and nitrification and denitrification processes

## Overview
- Context: NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (established 1999) studied soil biota diversity and functional roles in carbon and nitrogen cycles at the Sourhope field site in the Scottish Borders; 24 projects focused on soil structure, processes, microfauna, meso-/macro-fauna.
- Study focus: Static chamber measurements of nitrous oxide flux to assess how land management affects nitrogen cycling by nitrifiers and denitrifiers, and how environmental conditions influence nitric and nitrous oxide production and emission.

## Study design and field methods
- Field site design: Randomised block allocations with treatments – Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Nitrogen + Lime; general sampling areas S, T, U, V; ridges used for chamber placement due to soil moisture differences between ridges and furrows.
- Chamber construction: 40 cm diameter polypropylene tubes, 20 cm length; PVC flanges and silicone seals; gas sampling tube protruding ~15 cm; three-way PTFE tap; UV-permeable collapsible lids; volume recorded for each lid.
- Placement rules: Chambers placed on the lowest numbered general sampling area not blocked by a furrow.

## Analytical methods
- Nitrous oxide analysis: Gas collected in Tedlar bags or 10 ml syringes and analyzed by gas chromatography with an Electron Capture Detector (ECD).
- GC details: Chrompak CP 9000, Poropak Q column, oven 30°C, ECD 350°C, carrier gas nitrogen, flow ~5 ml/min; retention time ~2.87 minutes.
- Quality controls: Calibration standards (≈1 ppm N2O in nitrogen/air mix) included at start and end to adjust for drift; checks to remove interfering water vapor.

## Data structure and content
- Dataset: 1006 – Soil Nitrous oxide field flux data (P2118_SOIL_N2O_FIELD_FLUX_DATA.csv) collected May 2000–Nov 2001 by CEH Edinburgh.
- Key fields and descriptions:
  - EXP_ID: Block/main plot/sub-plot identifier
  - EXP_DATE: Sampling date
  - BLOCK: Block number (1–5)
  - MAIN_PLOT: Main plot letter (A–F)
  - SUB_PLOT: Sub-plot
  - CELL_X, CELL_Y: Cell grid coordinates
  - TREATMENT: Soil treatment (Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide)
  - NITROUS_OXIDE_FLOW: Net production/emission rate (micrograms N2O-N m^-2 h^-1)
- Data quality: Numeric range, formatting, and logical integrity checks; metadata describes units and data types; notes on detection limits.

## Key findings
- Liming increased gross nitrification rates relative to controls (approx. 1.6 μg N d^-1) and altered the nitric to nitrous oxide flux ratio.
- Nitrogen addition increased both nitric and nitrous oxide fluxes; however, gross nitrification rates under all nitrogen treatments decreased relative to control and lime/nitrite treatments.
