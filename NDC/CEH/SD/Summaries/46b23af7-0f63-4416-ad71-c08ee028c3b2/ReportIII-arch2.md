# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme study at Sourhope, a large, intensively observed field experiment to contextualise detailed research within environmental monitoring.
  - Monitoring used standardized data collection and analysis protocols to enable inter-year comparisons and links to other datasets.
  - 2001 site management impacted by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (visitor ban Feb–May; protocol-based resumption) and a change in site officer.

- Monitoring activities and data sources
  - Data types tracked in 2001 include: Automatic Weather Station records, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical (point quadrat) surveys.
  - Measurements followed established schedules and protocols (e.g., soil sampling 0–5 cm, mowing regimes, Point Quadrat surveys, and MAP/Genstat analyses).
  - Data handling and QA described (e.g., normalisation of biomass to a common reference plot, cross-checks between surveyors, and PCA for community composition).

- Key results by theme
  - Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - Headline 2001 climate data broadly unremarkable: rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar; average temperatures slightly down; soil moisture modestly higher than previous years.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Treatment hierarchy consistent across sampling periods; peak biomass in July/Aug across treatments.
    - 2001 biomass higher than prior years, likely due to staff changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Normalised against C1 to compare treatments; significant differences between improved (N and/or Lime) versus non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effect.
    - Nitrogen and/or Lime most effective at boosting biomass, with combined N & Lime often strongest.
  - Soil pH
    - Liming continued to raise surface pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots 6.19, N&L plots 6.38.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent; controls remained near baseline.
  - Botanical composition
    - July 2001 point quadrat survey: 58% more hits than 2000; surveyors’ results were not significantly different.
    - Species shifts by treatment: Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments; Festuca spp. increased (notably Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina depending on treatment); improved plots showed more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while unimproved plots retained species typical of poorer pastures (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
    - Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting possible diversity changes with improved fertility.
    - Multivariate analysis (PCA) separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; biomass was positively correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis and negatively with Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis.
    - Increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots indicated faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
    - Correlations between hits per major species and summer biomass supported community-structure shifts linked to fertility treatments.

- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
  - 3.1 Soil and vegetation heterogeneity
    - Spatial variation observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) tended to be more acidic; underlying heterogeneity suggested, overlapping with treatment distributions.
  - 3.2 Biomass variation and biomass–pH link
    - Outlying plots tended to have lower biomass across treatments; central plots often had higher biomass (e.g., N&L 2E, Lime 2C, Biocide 2D).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass overall.
    - No significant differences in biomass between blocks, indicating spatial patterning rather than block-level effects.

- Data quality, methods, and contextual notes
  - Weather, soil, and biomass data collected with consistent, documented protocols; quality assurance steps included cross-checks among surveyors and year-to-year comparisons (e.g., 2000 vs 2001).
  - Management and sampling continuity maintained despite 2001 disruptions; overall dataset supports long-term monitoring and cross-project comparisons.
  - Appendix and tables provide details on annual biomass, ANOVA results, species lists, and the methodological framework used for analysis.

- Implications for environmental monitoring
  - Fertility management (nitrogen and lime) has clear, measurable impacts on biomass production and soil chemistry, with linked shifts in plant community composition.
  - Spatial heterogeneity within the site influences biomass and pH relationships, underscoring the need for standardized, plot-level monitoring to discern treatment effects.
  - The monitoring framework, including standardized data collection, QA, and multivariate analyses (e.g., PCA), supports robust assessment of environmental health and policy-relevant trends over time.
