  - Composition across auger cores (4A–4F):
    - %N: ~0.53–0.58; %C: ~6.8–9.07; C:N: ~12.6–14.7.
    - Ca: ~1.0–5.0 meq/100g; Mg: ~0.58–3.5; K: ~0.59–0.83; Na: 0–0.15; %Moisture loss: ~4.29–5.19; LOI: ~14–21% (block-typical depth-dependent trends).
    - pH(H2O): ~4.45–4.95; pH(CaCl2): ~3.53–4.14.
  - Indicates increasing organic/inorganic soil development with depth and variation among subplots.

- ECOTRON soil site (Block 4 ECOTRON plot)
  - Soil analysis (ECOTRON Plot 1):
    - Wt: ~6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76 meq/100g; Na 0.15; K 0.62; Mg 1.7; %Moisture loss 4.79; %LOI 17.42; pH(H2O) 4.79; pH(CaCl2) 3.82.
  - Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT):
    - Subplots show variable species totals and presence/absence patterns across Ac, Ao, At, etc., indicating mosaic vegetation structure within the Ecotron environment.

- Vegetation data (Block 4)
  - Data collection method: primary survey via 50 x 50 cm quadrats within five of the fifteen 50 x 50 cm subplots per main plot; 25 points per quadrat recorded for presence/absence with abundance inferred from frequency.
  - Findings: 25+ species observed; dominant grasses include Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta; community analyses (Twinspan, NVC comparison) used to identify four overall communities and indicator species; NVC subcommunities indicate moister/damper areas and bryophyte dominance in specific blocks.
  - Vegetation data per plot and subplot detailed in site appendices (Appendix A) with species totals and occurrences.

- Site details and data management (Block 5 context)
  - Block 5 provides:
    - Site details: grid NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; Imperfect drainage; Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material igneous/andesite; horizons and profile pit depths.
    - Soil profiles (Block 5): horizon sequences with LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; detailed color, texture, structure, moisture, root presence, and boundary types.
    - Soil analysis (Block 5): horizon-level metrics for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2); auger samples with similar variables across 5A–5F; each with multiple depth horizons.
    - Vegetation data (Block 5): plot- and subplot-level species totals and presence/absence, with Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc as applicable.
  - ECOTRON data (Block 5 context) consistent with block-level data for integrated analysis.

- Data outputs, archiving, and integration
  - Data organized by block, horizon, plot, and Ecotron components; barcodes assigned to horizon samples; physical samples archived for long-term storage (e.g., -80°C).
  - Appendices and supplementary datasets (Appendix A; Tables 6–9; Twinspan/Association outputs) accompany the data for detailed analyses and replication.
  - Integrated data framework supports linking soil morphology, chemistry, and physics with vegetation composition and management practices across blocks.

- Relevance for data support archetype
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: field collection, horizon-level characterization, laboratory analyses, vegetation surveys, and long-term archiving.
  - Enables multi-layered data products and dashboards that correlate soil properties with vegetation communities and management treatments (e.g., grazing, liming, nitrogen addition) across blocks.
  - Supports cross-site and long-term ecological research within ECN Micronet contexts; data can underpin self-serve exploration tools for soil biodiversity, grassland ecology, and land-use impact analyses.
  - Highlights data quality considerations and variability due to horizon-specific development, block-to-block differences, and the need for careful data curation when integrating across multiple data types.
