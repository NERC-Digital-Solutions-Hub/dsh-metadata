# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- A detailed record of soil profiles, chemical analyses, auger sampling, and vegetation surveys at Sourhope (Rigg Foot), focusing on Block 4 and Block 5 data, with an Ecotron component.
- Documents horizon-level descriptions, laboratory measurements, sample provenance, and data management practices to support long-term ecological analyses.

## Overview of content and purpose

- Profiles describe soil horizons from surface to deeper layers (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.) with depth ranges and narrative descriptions.
- Analyses include soil chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg), moisture loss, loss on ignition, pH in water and CaCl2, and particle- and stone content indicators.
- Vegetation surveys accompany soil data, providing plot- and subplot-level Species totals and counts.
- Data are organized with barcodes for traceability and archived for long-term reuse; part of wider programs (ECN/MICRONET) and integrated with Ecotron studies.

## Site details and sampling design

- Location: Sourhope, Rigg Foot area; Block 4 and Block 5 footprints with horizon-specific profiles and auger sampling points.
- Depths covered: horizon sequence from 0–100 cm across multiple horizons (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.); additional auger samples sampled at multiple short depths (e.g., 0–30 cm).
- Profile descriptions emphasize texture, structure, moisture, root presence, stone content, mottling, and boundary characteristics.
- Ecotron component: dedicated plots (Ecotron) with controlled-environment experiments linked to the soil-vegetation data.

## Soil profile descriptions (highlights)

- Block 4: FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bsg, Cgx with specific color codes, textures (e.g., sandy silt loam, clay loams), and horizon boundaries (sharp, wavy, or smooth).
- Block 5: Similar horizon sequence with Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, and detailed structural descriptions (blocky to massive structures) and characteristic mottling.
- Common features across blocks: presence of igneous stones (intermediate igneous andesite), fine roots, and varying boundary types between horizons.

## Soil analyses and key measurements

- Horizon-level analyses (Block 4 and Block 5):
  - %N and %C (with C:N ratios)
  - Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g)
  - %Moisture loss and %Loss on Ignition
  - pH in water and pH in CaCl2
  - Moisture content, horizon-specific values, and traceable weights (mg) for each horizon and sample
- Auger samples:
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2)
  - Provides finer-scale depth profiling for surface layers (0–30 cm, various sub-samples)
- Data labeling and traceability:
  - MLURI barcodes (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) associated with each horizon sample
  - Individual auger samples labeled (e.g., 4A–4F; 5A–5F) with corresponding analyses

## Vegetation surveys and ecotron components

- Vegetation data per plot/subplot:
  - Species presence/absence, counts, and totals across subplots (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm Je Lm Lzm Mc Ns Pe Pp Pt Ra Rr Rs Tr Vc)
  - Block-level tallies indicate community composition by plot and depth-related sampling
- Ecotron soil site:
  - Soil analysis (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O and CaCl2)
  - Vegetation survey data linked to Ecotron plots, illustrating controlled-environment responses

## Data management, provenance, and storage

- Sample labeling:
  - Horizon samples tracked with MLURI barcodes to maintain traceability across analyses and blocks
- Storage and archiving:
  - Soil samples archived with detailed horizon designations; long-term storage facilities and protocols implied (e.g., -80°C archiving)
- Data hosting and governance:
  - Data managed within MLURI/CEH frameworks; linked to ECN/MICRONET program structures
  - Comprehensive metadata implied to enable cross-plot and cross-year analyses

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations for data leaders

- Coverage and sampling scope:
  - Some plots/horizons are not fully sampled in every year; data serve as a guide rather than a complete census for all subplots
- Spatial and temporal variability:
  - Seasonal effects, grazing exclosure, and plot-specific history influence soil chemistry and vegetation; careful temporal and spatial normalization needed
- Data integration:
  - Multiple data streams (horizon morphology, chemical analyses, moisture metrics, pH, vegetation totals) require robust metadata standards for cross-dataset linkage
- Standards and comparability:
  - Horizon codes and measurement protocols align with established soil-chemical analyses; consistency essential for longitudinal comparisons

## Key outputs and takeaways for data-driven leadership

- A multi-layered dataset linking soil horizon properties to vegetation composition across a structured experimental design
- Strong data governance: barcode-traceable samples, centralized storage, and long-term archiving enabling reuse
- Established analytic frameworks (horizon-level chemistry, moisture, LOI, pH) complemented by vegetation surveys for integrated ecological insights
- An interconnected dataset supporting broader environmental monitoring and cross-site comparisons within ECN/MICRONET and Ecotron contexts

## Programme context and connections

- Sourhope data contribute to ECN and SERAD/MICRONET-funded field biodiversity and soil–plant interaction studies
- Data support broader ecological and environmental change research, with implications for grassland management, soil health, and sustainable land-use objectives
- The Ecotron component enables controlled experiments to complement field observations, enhancing cross-site generalizability and long-term monitoring goals
