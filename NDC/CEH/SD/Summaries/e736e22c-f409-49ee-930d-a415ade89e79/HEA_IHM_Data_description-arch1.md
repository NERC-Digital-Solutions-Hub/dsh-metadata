# HEA/IHM data collection guide for NERC upload

- The dataset combines raw Household Economy Approach (HEA) data from 16 communities in Katakwi district with raw Individual Household Method (IHM) data from Anyangabella (42 households) and Kaikamosing (51 households), collected in December 2020. It focuses on crop calendars and livelihoods.
- The data were collected to support vulnerability assessment, livelihood impact modelling, and the development of targeted policies to bolster resilience at household and community levels.

## Methodology

- HEA methodology
  - Demarcate rural livelihood zones based on land use, climate, rainfall, markets, and other economic information.
  - Identify a reference year (recent, representative conditions) in consultation with local informants.
  - Purposively select sample locations within each zone to represent variation.
  - Conduct initial village interviews to define wealth-group characteristics.
  - Run focus-group interviews by wealth group (e.g., very poor, poor, middle, better-off) to establish incomes and expenditures for a typical household in the reference year.
  - Use the baseline data to simulate impacts of shocks on access to food and basic non-food needs for each wealth group.
- IHM methodology
  - Semi-structured interviews conducted with the aid of open-IHM software in the field for data checking and analysis.
  - Stage 1: identify livelihood zones and survey sites; gather contextual information from focus groups across economic activities.
  - Stage 2: interview selected households covering comprehensive income sources and related details without unnecessary questions.
  - Data collected include household demography, assets, crop/livestock production, employment, wild foods, non-market transfers, and characteristics such as gender of the household head and education.
  - On collection day, data are entered into open-IHM, checked for consistency and disparities; anomalies trigger revisits and potential amendments.

## Data contents and structure

- The dataset comprises quantitative information on household and individual livelihoods. Monetary data are in Uganda Shillings (UGX).
- HEA data are organized by wealth group within each community; IHM data are organized by individual.
- Data categories cover a broad set of aspects, including:
  - (Community) Disposable Income and its subcategories (e.g., by wealth group, family size, standard of living adjustments)
  - (Community) Disposable Income with Standard of Living (DI with Standard of Living) and related components (energy kcal requirements, social inclusion costs, survival costs)
  - (Community) Cash Income and its subcategories (sales, livestock, employment, transfers, wild foods)
  - (Community) Food Income (in kcal) and related subcategories
  - Land Assets (types by location) and Livestock Assets (types and units)
  - Custom report specifications and developmental data (e.g., number of households/individuals, data summaries)
- Additional IHM categories
  - Calculate Adult Equivalent (adult daily kcal equivalents)
  - Report Household Members Characteristics (age, sex, headship, education)
  - Report Population by age/sex and related breakdowns
  - Age data (files represent various aspects of data)
- Each file corresponds to a specific data aspect (HEA or IHM), and researchers should refer to the HEA/IHM methodology for detailed understanding.

## Data collection context and quality

- Local partnerships conducted data collection; data collected in local language and translated into English by the data collectors.
- The dataset represents a complete collection intended to support robust vulnerability analysis and policy development.

## Purpose and use

- Designed to support analysis of vulnerability levels and to inform livelihood impact modelling.
- Aims to guide targeted policies to enhance resilience at both household and community levels.
- Data are intended to be used in conjunction with HEA/IHM methodological guidance for accurate interpretation and analysis.

## Additional notes

- Information sources include the Evidence for Development (EfD) website, with methods for HEA and IHM referenced.
- The dataset is described as complete, reflecting a comprehensive data collection conducted in December 2020 within Katakwi district communities and the Anyangabella and Kaikamosing communities.
