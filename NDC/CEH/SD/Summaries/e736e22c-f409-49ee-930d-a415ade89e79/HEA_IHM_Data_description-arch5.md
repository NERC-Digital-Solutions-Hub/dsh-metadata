# HEA/IHM data collection guide for NERC upload

- Overview
  - A dataset resulting from the raw Household Economy Approach (HEA) data collected in 16 communities in Katakwi district and the raw Individual Household Method (IHM) data from Anyangabella (42 households) and Kaikamosing (51 households).
  - Collected in December 2020; includes crop calendars for Katakwi district.
  - Aims to support vulnerability analysis, livelihood impact modelling, and the development of targeted policies for household and community resilience.
  - Data collection team comprised local Ugandan partners; collected in the local language and translated into English.

- Methodology (HEA)
  - Demarcation of rural livelihood zones based on land use, climate, rainfall, markets, and other economic information.
  - Identification of a reference year through local consultation; purposive sampling to represent variation within each zone.
  - Village interviews to characterize wealth groups; focus-group interviews per wealth group (very poor, poor, middle, better-off) to establish typical household incomes and expenditures for the reference year.
  - Baseline data across zones to model impacts of shocks on access to food and basic needs.

- Methodology (IHM)
  - Data collected via semi-structured interviews using specialized field software to enable field checks and rapid analysis.
  - Identification of livelihood zones and survey sites; contextual data gathered from focus groups (involving men and women across economic activities) to cross-check household responses.
  - Interviews cover: demography, assets, crop and livestock production, employment, wild foods, non-market transfers, and other household characteristics (e.g., gender of head, education level).
  - In-field data checks for internal consistency and plausibility; anomalies trigger revisits and possible data amendments.
  - Data entered into open-IHM software and validated in real time.

- Data contents and structure
  - Data types include quantitative measures of household and individual livelihoods.
  - Monetary data is in Uganda Shillings (UGX). HEA data is reported per wealth group; IHM data is reported per individual.
  - Data headings cover multiple categories, such as:
    - Disposable Income (DI) and DI with Standard of Living (SToL), including subheadings by community, wealth group, family size, and related calculations.
    - Crop Cash Income, Employment Cash Income, Livestock Cash Income, Transfer Cash Income, Wild Food Cash Income.
    - Food Income (in kilocalories) with analogous subheadings.
    - Assets data: Land (including upland and wetland categories), Livestock assets.
    - Custom and derived fields (e.g., N/A or auto-generated summaries).
    - Micronutrients (being developed; not yet populated).
  - Additional IHM categories include:
    - Calculate Adult Equivalent (linked to DI with SToL).
    - Report on Household Members (age, sex, headship, etc.).
    - Population by sex and age ranges.
  - File organization: each data file corresponds to a distinct aspect of data; HEA file types reference Community terms, while IHM file types do not.

- Data quality and completeness
  - Data collection aimed for completeness; described as a complete dataset.
  - Ongoing quality checks include consistency and alignment with observed living conditions; anomalies prompt revisits and potential dataset amendments.
  - Data were translated to English from the local language to support wider use.

- Data governance and sharing considerations
  - The guide is prepared for uploading to the NERC data portal, indicating an emphasis on standards and interoperability for data sharing.
  - Data are organized to support reuse in vulnerability assessment and policy development, with clear documentation of data collection methods and variable definitions.
  - Researchers should consult the HEA/IHM methodology descriptions to understand data interpretation and ensure correct analysis across wealth-group (HEA) and individual (IHM) levels.

- Language, provenance, and references
  - Collected in local language; translations completed by the data collection team.
  - Methodology references available through EfD (Evidence for Development) webpage, with links provided for HEA and IHM methods.
