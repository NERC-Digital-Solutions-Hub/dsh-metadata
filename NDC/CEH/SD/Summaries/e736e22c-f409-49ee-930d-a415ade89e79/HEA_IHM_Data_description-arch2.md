HEA/IHM data collection guide for NERC upload

## Overview
- Dataset produced from raw Household Economy Approach (HEA) data collected in 16 communities in Katakwi district.
- Raw Individual Household Method (IHM) data collected with 42 households in Anyangabella and 51 households in Kaikamosing.
- Collection occurred in December 2020 and focuses on crop calendars for Katakwi.
- Methodology references are available from established HEA/IHM resources.

## Methodology
- HEA approach
  - Demarcate rural livelihood zones based on land use, climate, rainfall, markets, and other economic information.
  - Identify a reference year representing typical conditions in consultation with local informants.
  - Purposively select sample locations to represent variation within each livelihood zone.
  - Conduct village interviews to determine wealth-group characteristics; then interviews with focus groups from each wealth group to establish incomes and expenditures for a typical household in the reference year.
  - Use the baseline dataset to simulate impacts of economic shocks on food and basic non-food needs across wealth groups.
- IHM approach
  - Identify livelihood zones and survey sites within the zone; gather contextual economic data via focus groups (including both women and men in different activities).
  - Conduct semi-structured interviews with selected households, covering demography, assets, crop/livestock production, employment, wild foods, transfers, and other relevant characteristics.
  - Enter data into open-IHM software, perform in-field checks for consistency and disparities; revisit households if anomalies are found to amend datasets.
  - Software-enabled rapid analysis to provide up-to-date information for decision-makers.
- Data collection team comprised local Ugandan partners; all data collected in local language and translated into English.

## Data Content and Structure
- Data types
  - HEA data: per community and wealth group (e.g., Disposable Income, DI with Standard of Living, KCal-based measures, asset data, etc.).
  - IHM data: per individual (e.g., income sources, demography, assets, crop/livestock details, employment, transfers, wild foods, etc.).
- Key data headings and concepts (examples)
  - Community Disposable Income: total income after meeting food energy needs; can be negative.
  - DI with Standard of Living: standardization for household membership; subcomponents include family size, energy needs, social inclusion costs, and survival costs.
  - Cash Income: sources include crop sales, livestock sales, employment, transfers, and wild foods; recorded in UGX.
  - Food Income: all sources of income as food consumed (in kcal) and corresponding cash-value equivalents for traded food.
  - Land Assets and Livestock Assets: quantities per household/wealth group or individual (types defined; units used).
  - Micronutrients: development in software to assess micronutrients based on food consumption (not yet fully available).
  - Adult Equivalent and Related Outputs: adult-equivalent kcal calculations; age/sex details for household members.
  - Population Outputs: counts by sex and age ranges.
  - Custom/Output Specifications: automated summaries and report metadata.
- Granularity
  - HEA: data by community and wealth group.
  - IHM: data by individual household members.
- Purpose of data
  - Support analysis of vulnerability and livelihood resilience.
  - Enable livelihood impact modelling.
  - Inform targeted policies at household and community levels.

## Data Quality, Validation, and Language
- In-field checks: data entered into open-IHM software is checked for internal consistency and alignment with observed living conditions.
- Anomalies trigger revisits and dataset amendments as needed.
- Language: data collected in local language, translated into English by data collectors.
- The dataset is presented as a complete, comprehensive collection.

## Use for Environmental Monitoring and Policy
- Designed to support consistent, time-series analysis of vulnerability and resilience in livelihood systems.
- Enables standardised outputs for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Supports integration with other relevant datasets to enhance the value and accessibility of monitoring data for broader use and scrutiny.
