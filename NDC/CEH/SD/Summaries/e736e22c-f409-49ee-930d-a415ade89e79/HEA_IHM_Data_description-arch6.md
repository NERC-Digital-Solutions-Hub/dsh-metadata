# HEA/IHM data collection guide for NERC upload

- Purpose and scope
  - This data collection guide presents the HEA/IHM datasets collected for NERC upload.
  - Data come from the raw Household Economy Approach (HEA) collected in 16 communities in Katakwi district and the raw Individual Household Method (IHM) data collected with 42 households in Anyangabella and 51 households in Kaikamosing.
  - Data collection occurred in December 2020 and depict crop calendars for Katakwi district.
  - The data support analysis of vulnerability and livelihood impact modeling to inform targeted policies for resilience at household and community levels.

- Methodology overview
  - HEA methodology
    - Delineate rural livelihood zones based on land use, climate, rainfall, markets, and other economic information.
    - Identify a reference year with typical conditions in consultation with local informants.
    - Purposively sample locations to reflect variation within zones.
    - Conduct village interviews to define wealth-group characteristics.
    - Run focus-group interviews for each wealth group (e.g., very poor to better-off) to establish incomes and expenditures of a typical household in the reference year.
    - Build a baseline dataset to simulate impacts of shocks on access to food and basic needs.
  - IHM methodology
    - Uses semi-structured interviews and specialized software to enable field data checks and rapid analyses.
    - Identify livelihood zones and survey sites; gather contextual information from focus groups with diverse economic participants.
    - Interview selected households focusing on all relevant income sources and details (demography, assets, crops/livestock, employment, wild foods, transfers, and other characteristics like gender of head of household and education).
    - Data entered into open-IHM software and checked for consistency; anomalies trigger re-visits and data amendments.

- Data contents and structure
  - The dataset includes quantitative information on household and individual livelihoods.
  - HEA data are organized by wealth group at the community level; IHM data are organized by individual.
  - Monetary data are reported in Uganda Shillings (UGX); calories and other nutrition-related data (where applicable) are tracked in kcal.
  - Key data areas (HEA and IHM categories share many headings):
    - Community Disposable Income (DI) and DI with Standard of Living (SToL)
      - Subheadings include: Community, Wealth group, Family Group Size, Disposable Income; KCal Requirement; Social Inclusion SToL; Survival SToL.
    - Cash Income
      - Subcategories cover sources such as crops, livestock sales, employment/self-employment, transfers, and wild foods.
    - Food Income
      - Recording all income in terms of food consumed (kcal) and, where applicable, cash-equivalent values.
    - Assets
      - Land Assets (ownership by wealth group/individual; types: Upland, Upland rented, Wetland)
      - Livestock Assets (types and counts)
    - Other data fields
      - Micronutrients (in development; will reflect micronutrient data based on consumption)
      - Custom Report Spec (auto-generated data summaries)
  - Additional IHM data categories
    - Calculate Adult Equivalent (adult daily kcal equivalents)
    - Report HH Members Character (age, birth year, sex, head of household)
    - Report Population by (demographic breakdowns by age/sex)
  - File structure
    - Each data file corresponds to a specific aspect of HEA or IHM data.
    - Data are designed to support vulnerability assessment and targeted policy development.

- Data quality and collection logistics
  - Data collected by local Ugandan partners in the local language; translated into English by data collectors.
  - In-field data entry into open-IHM software with built-in checks; inconsistencies prompt revisits and corrections.
  - The dataset is described as complete and self-contained, suitable for immediate analysis and downstream use.

- References and provenance
  - Methodology and definitions align with the Evidence for Development (EfD) HEA/IHM methods.
  - EfD method resources cited (URLs provided in the guide) for researchers seeking deeper methodological context.

- Intended use
  - To support vulnerability analysis, livelihood impact modeling, and the development of targeted resilience policies at household and community levels.
  - Data are suitable for researchers and policymakers aiming to understand wealth-group dynamics, income sources, consumption, assets, and nutrition-related aspects in Katakwi and the study communities.
