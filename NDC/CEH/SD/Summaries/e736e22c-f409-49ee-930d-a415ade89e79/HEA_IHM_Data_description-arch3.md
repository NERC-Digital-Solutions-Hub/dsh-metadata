# HEA/IHM data collection guide for NERC upload

## Overview
- Dataset derived from HEA (Household Economy Approach) data collected in 16 communities in Katakwi district and IHM (Individual Household Method) data from 42 households in Anyangabella and 51 households in Kaikamosing.
- Collected in December 2020; includes crop calendars and detailed household/community livelihood information.
- Aims to support analysis of vulnerability, livelihood impacts, and the development of targeted policies to enhance resilience at household and community levels.

## Methodology

- HEA (Household Economy Approach)
  - Demarcate rural livelihood zones based on land use, climate, rainfall, markets, and other economic information.
  - Identify a reference year in consultation with local informants; purposively sample locations representing variation in the zone.
  - Conduct village interviews to establish wealth group characteristics; perform focus-group interviews with each wealth group to determine typical incomes and expenditures for the reference year.
  - Use baseline data to simulate impacts of economic shocks or changes on access to food and basic needs for different wealth groups within the zone.

- IHM (Individual Household Method)
  - Identify livelihood zones and survey sites; collect contextual economic information from focus groups with participants across economic activities.
  - Interview selected households using semi-structured questions covering all relevant income sources and related details (demography, assets, crop/livestock production, employment, wild foods, non-market transfers, and household characteristics such as gender of head and education).
  - Data entered into open-IHM software; field checks performed to ensure internal consistency, biological adequacy, and alignment with observed living conditions.
  - If anomalies are found, revisit households and amend datasets as needed.
  - Data collected in the local language, then translated into English by the data collectors.

## Data structure and fields

- HEA data (per community and wealth group)
  - Examples of data categories: Community Disposable Income, Disposable Income with Standard of Living (and subcomponents), Cash Income (by source), Food Income (by source), Land Assets (types and ownership), Livestock Assets (types and counts), and related metrics (e.g., Standard of Living costs, survival costs).

- IHM data (per individual)
  - Includes monetary and non-monetary income sources, demographic details, assets, and household characteristics.
  - Subheadings cover topics such as Crop Cash Income, Employment Cash Income, Wild Food Cash Income, and other income streams.
  - Additional categories include Adult Equivalent calculations, Household Members’ characteristics, and population by age/sex.

- Data categories are organized into data files with specific headings, such as Community Disposable Income, DI with Standard of Living, Cash Income, Food Income, Land Assets, Livestock Assets, Micronutrients (under development), and Custom Report specifications.

- Additional IHM categories
  - Calculate Adult Equivalent (adult daily equivalent kcal)
  - Report HH Members Character (age, sex, role, headship)
  - Report Population by (age/sex distributions)

- Data files and structure
  - Each file corresponds to an aspect of data (HEA or IHM) with distinctions between community-level and individual-level data.
  - Monetary data are in Uganda Shillings (UGX); food-related data are in kilocalories (kcal).

## Data quality, translation, and completeness

- Data collection conducted by local Ugandan partners; collected in the local language and translated into English by the collectors.
- Data entered into open-IHM software during collection and subjected to in-field quality checks for internal consistency and plausibility; anomalies trigger follow-up interviews or amendments.
- The dataset is described as complete and self-contained, designed to support vulnerability analysis and resilience-focused policy development.

## Language, provenance, and governance

- Based on EfD (Evidence for Development) methodology sources for HEA/IHM; included references to method descriptions and practical notes.
- Data collection emphasizes timely, high-quality data with open processing via specialized software and clear documentation of data categories and lineage.
- Collected to enable transparent analysis of livelihoods and policy-relevant insights, with detailed methodological notes provided to researchers accessing the dataset.

## Purpose and policy relevance

- Purpose: to support analysis of vulnerability and to inform livelihood impact modelling.
- Intended use: to guide the design and targeting of policies and interventions that enhance resilience at household and community levels in Katakwi district and similar contexts.
