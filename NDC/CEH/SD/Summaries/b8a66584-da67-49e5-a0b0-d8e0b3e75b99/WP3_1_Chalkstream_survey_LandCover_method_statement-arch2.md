# What has been recorded and what form does the data take?

- Data captured: Areal coverage (km2) of 12 land cover classes for each of 20 chalkstream catchments in southern England; includes GB Ordnance Survey grid references for each stream site.
- Data structure: Matrix of 12 land cover classes by 20 stream sites, with the area of each land cover class provided in km2.
- Site identifiers and coordinates: RIVER_ID, SITE_ID, RIVER_NAME, SITE_NAME, NGR, EASTING, NORTHING.
- Land cover classes (LCM2007 Broad Habitat Name) and areas (km2): Broadleaved_km2; Coniferous_km2; Arable_km2; Impr_Grass_km2; Acid_Grass_km2; Neut_Grass_km2; Calc_Grass_km2; Rough_Grass_km2; Heath_km2; Built_Area_km2; Rock_km2; Freshwater_km2; TOTAL_AREA_km2 (total).
- Geographic scope: 20 chalkstream catchments distributed along white chalk geology from Dorset (southwest) through Wiltshire to Hampshire (northeast).
- Time of data collection: July 2012.
- How data were collected:
  - Upstream catchment shapefiles generated from stream site coordinates using WINFAP-FEH 3 software (50m2 resolution).
  - Catchment shapefiles used to clip the Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) layer (via ArcGIS Clip).
  - Areal coverage of each land cover class derived from clipped LCM2007 within each catchment.
- Purpose: To aid site selection for surveying chalkstreams across a gradient of catchment land cover intensification, from calcareous grassland/woodland-dominated to arable/improved grasslands.
- Responsible personnel: Dr John Murphy (QMUL) with Dr Tom Oliver and Dr Jon Redhead (CEH) for generating catchment land cover data.
- Data completeness and quality:
  - Completeness: The dataset is complete.
  - Validation: Visual checks of each catchment shapefile ensured error-free generation before clipping LCM2007.
- Data fields (summary of columns):
  - River and site identifiers: RIVER_ID, SITE_ID, RIVER_NAME, SITE_NAME, NGR, EASTING, NORTHING.
  - Land cover areas by class (LCM2007 Broad Habitat Name with km2 units): Broadleaved_km2; Coniferous_km2; Arable_km2; Impr_Grass_km2; Acid_Grass_km2; Neut_Grass_km2; Calc_Grass_km2; Rough_Grass_km2; Heath_km2; Built_Area_km2; Rock_km2; Freshwater_km2; TOTAL_AREA_km2.
