# Soil biochemical measurements from saltmarshes of different ages on the Essex coast, UK 2011..

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides soil biogeochemical measurements across a chronosequence of salt marsh restoration/breach history on the Essex coast, UK.
  - Aims to inform understanding of how soil properties change with time since restoration or breach and how restored sites compare with natural marsh and former marsh fields.
  - Variables cover bulk density, moisture, pH, electrical conductivity, inorganic nitrogen, organic matter, below-ground biomass, carbon and nitrogen content.

- Study design and sites
  - Sites include three restored salt marshes and six accidentally breached salt marsh sites, plus natural marsh references and fields on former salt marsh.
  - Chronosequence spans from 16 to 114 years since restoration/breach (e.g., Tollesbury 16 years; Barrow Hill and others up to 114 years).
  - Natural reference marshes provided for comparative baseline.
  - Grid references are provided for each site; fields on former marsh have separate coordinates.
  - Note: Some sites have long breach histories; Northey Natural is used as a natural reference for Northey and Northey Island restored/breached sites.

- Sampling and measurements
  - Salt marsh sampling conducted in October 2011; Tollesbury field samples in July 2010; Barrow Hill, Wallasea Island, and Brandy Hole in April 2017. No planned repeat sampling.
  - Field sampling: four sampling locations per salt marsh; three soil cores per location; cores are 4 cm in diameter and 30 cm long; cores taken away from field edges.
  - Fields on former marsh had 2–6 sampling locations.
  - Laboratory analyses (for field samples):  
    - Field measurements: bulk density, moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) in 1:2.5 water suspension.
    - Organic matter: loss on ignition (LOI) at 375°C for 16 hours.
    - Inorganic nitrogen: ammonium (NH4+) and total oxidised nitrogen (TON/NO3-) via 1M KCl extraction with colorimetric analysis.
    - Carbon and nitrogen: total C and N by combustion (CN analyzer).
  - Below-ground biomass: measured to 30 cm depth by washing roots, drying, and weighing.
  - Standards and calibration: laboratory equipment calibrated according to CEH Bangor practices; field sampling performed with standardized procedures.

- Data formats and metadata
  - Data stored as comma-separated values (.csv).
  - Dataset fields include: SiteName, SiteCode, BulkDensity, MoistureContent, pH, Conductivity, NO3-N (TON), NH4-N, OrganicMatter, BelowGround, Carbon, Nitrogen, plus an indication of missing data where applicable.
  - Dataset field descriptions provide details on header descriptions and cell formats; notes indicate missing data where samples were lost or not analyzed.
  - Some entries include duplicates or iterative descriptions in the detail text (e.g., laboratory procedures), but core variables and field names are clearly defined.

- Data quality, governance, and openness
  - Data quality steps include data entry checks and outlier screening.
  - Calibration and laboratory practices are standardized at CEH Bangor, ensuring consistency in measurements.
  - Clear notes on data quality barriers: missing data due to sample loss; some variables may have incomplete records; metadata completeness is addressed within the dataset field descriptions.
  - Public sharing of underlying data is considered in the dataset description, with emphasis on transparency of data and governance of shared data.

- Key variables and dataset fields (examples)
  - SiteName, SiteCode: identifiers for each site.
  - BulkDensity, MoistureContent, pH, Conductivity (EC).
  - NO3-N, NH4-N (nitrogen species).
  - OrganicMatter (loss on ignition).
  - BelowGround (biomass to 30 cm).
  - Carbon, Nitrogen (percentage content).

- Temporal and spatial coverage
  - Temporal coverage includes: October 2011 (salt marsh sampling), 2010 (Tollesbury field sampling), 2017 (Barrow Hill, Wallasea Island, Brandy Hole fields).
  - Spatial coverage includes nine salt marsh sites with natural marsh references and fields on former salt marsh, with precise grid references provided for each site.

- References and provenance
  - Key methodological references include: Avery, Bascombe (1974) on soil moisture and EC measurements; Ball (1964) on LOI as a measure of organic matter and organic carbon.
  - Data collection and laboratory practices align with CEH Bangor standards.
