# Soil biochemical measurements from saltmarshes of different ages on the Essex coast, UK 2011..

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a chronological (chronosequence) dataset of soil biochemical properties across salt marshes of different restoration ages (16 to 114 years) on the Essex coast, including natural marsh references and fields on former salt marsh.
  - Aims to enable comparison of soil chemistry, organic matter, and below-ground biomass as tidal-flow restoration progresses, and to support data reuse and broader policy/topical analyses.

- Content and key variables
  - Physical and chemical soil properties (to 30 cm depth): bulk density, moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity (EC).
  - Nutrients and organic matter: available ammonium (NH4+), total oxidised nitrogen (TON/NO3-), total soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), organic matter by loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - Biotic component: below-ground biomass to 30 cm depth.
  - Data structure includes two main dataset fields descriptions: Saltmarsh_Chronosequence_data_2011.csv and Saltmarsh_Chronosequence_data_2010_2017.csv.
  - Core identifiers: SiteName, SiteCode; site-specific measurements for BulkDensity, MoistureContent, pH, Conductivity, NO3-N, NH4-N, OrganicMatter, BelowGround, Carbon, Nitrogen; and notes on missing data.

- Sampling design and timeline
  - Field sampling conducted in October 2011; some earlier (Tollesbury 2010) and later (2017) field samples included to extend the chronology; no planned repeat sampling.
  - Sampling locations per marsh: four locations for each salt marsh site.
  - Core methodology: 4 cm diameter, 30 cm length; three cores per sampling location.
  - Sample processing: field sampling at vegetated marsh (>1.5 m Datum); cores divided into subsamples for laboratory analyses.

- Sites and references
  - Restored and breached salt marsh sites across multiple locations: Tollesbury, Orplands, Northey MR, Barrow Hill, Ferry Lane (B), Wallasea Island, Northey Island, North Fambridge, Brandy Hole.
  - Natural salt marsh references included for comparison (e.g., Northey Natural used as reference for Northey and Northey Island restored/breached sites).
  - Grid references (Easting/Northing) provided for each site, natural marsh, and fields on former salt marsh to enable spatial linking.

- Laboratory methods and data processing
  - Field and lab practices aligned with Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) Bangor standards.
  - Lab analyses:
    - EC and pH measured in water suspensions and with standard meters.
    - Organic matter via LOI at 375°C.
    - NH4+ and NO3- determined by 1 M KCl extraction followed by colorimetric analysis.
    - Total C and N measured by CN analysis (combustion).
    - Below-ground biomass quantified by washing root material, drying at 80°C for 72 hours, and weighing.
  - Calibration and quality control:
    - Calibration per CEH Bangor procedures.
    - Data checked for outliers and errors during spreadsheet entry.

- Data formats and access
  - Primary data stored as comma-separated values (CSV) files.
  - Dataset fields include descriptive headers and explicit notes about missing data where applicable.
  - Two related data files:
    - Saltmarsh_Chronosequence_data_2011.csv
    - Saltmarsh_Chronosequence_data_2010_2017.csv

- Data quality, limitations, and last notes
  - Data quality checks include outlier screening and standard spreadsheet-level QA.
  - Some missing data exist due to loss of samples during processing or non-analysis of certain variables.
  - No explicit planned re-sampling; the dataset captures a single primary time point with supplementary years for select sites.

- Context and references
  - References used for methods include Avery & Bascombe (1974) and Ball (1964) for LOI and soil analysis methodologies.
  - Data designed to support cross-site comparisons across a restoration timeline and to enable re-use in broader ecological or policy contexts.
