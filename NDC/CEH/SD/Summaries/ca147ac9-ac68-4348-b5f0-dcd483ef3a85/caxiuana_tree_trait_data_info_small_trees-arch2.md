# Supporting information for Traits data from juvenile trees exposed to a 50% reducing in canopy throughfall at the Caxiuanã drought experiment, Brazil, August to September 2017

## Overview
- Data originate from the Caxiuanã through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in eastern Amazonia, designed to simulate drought by removing 50% of canopy throughfall on one hectare while leaving a nearby control plot without a drought structure.
- The study measures a suite of tree traits to understand how juvenile tropical forest trees adjust carbon metabolism, hydraulic traits, and leaf/wood properties under reduced water input.

## Experimental context
- Location: Caxiuanã, eastern Amazonia (approximately 1°43' S, 51°27' W).
- Plots: 1 ha drought plot with a plastic panel structure and a 1 ha control plot.
- Throughfall exclusion has been in place since 2002, enabling long-term comparisons between drought-affected and control trees.

## Sampling design and scope
- Sampling period: September–October 2017 (peak dry season).
- Trees: 76 individuals across the two plots (43 on control, 33 on TFE); efforts were made to cover different size classes (DBH from 1 cm to 10 cm).
- Genera: Most common genera on both plots were sampled.
- Branch sampling: Three branches per tree collected daily to obtain multiple measurements and to allow allocation of measurements to different traits.

## Traits measured (17 traits)
- Plot/Description: Control or Drought plot (TFE).
- Species: Species identification.
- DBH: Diameter at breast height (cm).
- Vcmax: Max. carboxylation capacity (μmol CO2 m−2 s−1).
- Jmax: Max. electron transport capacity (μmol CO2 m−2 s−1).
- R leaf: Leaf respiration in the dark (μmol CO2 m−2 s−1).
- Min gs: Min. stomatal conductance (mmol CO2 m−2 s−1).
- LMA: Leaf mass per area (g m−2).
- N leaf: Leaf nitrogen content (g g−1).
- P leaf: Leaf phosphorus content (g g−1).
- Thickness: Leaf thickness (mm).
- ρ: Branch wood density (g cm−3).
- Ψpd: Pre-dawn leaf water potential (MPa).
- Ψmd: Midday leaf water potential (MPa).
- P50: Xylem pressure for 50% loss of conductance (MPa).
- P88: Xylem pressure for 88% loss of conductance (MPa).
- Ksmax: Max. lumen conductance (mol H2O m−1 MPa−1 s−1 m−2).
- PLC: Percentage loss of conductivity.
- LA:SA: Leaf area to sapwood area ratio.

## Sampling methodology by trait group
- Ψpd: Branch 1 collected 04:30–06:30, wrapped and rehydrated for 24 hours, then measured.
- P50, P88, Ksmax, PLC: Measured on processed branch samples using hydraulic methods described in the pneumatic/embolisms-based approach.
- A–Ci traits: Branch 2 (10:00–12:00) leaves used in Li-COR 6400 photosynthesis system to derive Vcmax, Jmax, and leaf photosynthesis parameters; corresponding leaf gas exchange data used for R leaf, Min gs, and Max gs.
- P leaves and tissue chemistry: Leaves used for A–Ci curves and R leaf were dried to measure P leaf, N leaf, and LMA.
- Ψmd, LA:SA: Branch 3 (13:00–14:00) collected; three leaves measured for Ψmd, then branch assessed for PLC, Ksmax, and LA:SA via leaf area and sapwood area analyses using ImageJ.

## Data quality and processing
- Quality control: Data were checked and outliers or poor fits were removed where curves could not be fitted to the models (e.g., P50, P88, Ksmax, PLC, Vcmax, Jmax). Removed data are represented as NA in the dataset.
- Missing data: NA also used to indicate samples lost or damaged during collection/measurement, or data not collectible for other reasons.
- Consistency checks: Remaining data were validated to align with ranges reported in comparable studies for the respective variables.
- Method references for trait collection: Detailed methodologies linked to Bartholomew et al. (2020) and Giles et al. (2022); supporting techniques for plant hydraulics follow Pereira et al. (2016, 2012) and imaging/analysis methods (Schneider et al. 2012).

## Relevance to environmental monitoring
- The dataset supports monitoring environmental health and plant functional responses to drought, contributing to understanding of how juvenile tropical trees adjust physiology and hydraulic properties under reduced throughfall.
- Findings enable standardized comparisons across plots and time, aligning with the goal of consistent environmental health and policy performance assessments.
