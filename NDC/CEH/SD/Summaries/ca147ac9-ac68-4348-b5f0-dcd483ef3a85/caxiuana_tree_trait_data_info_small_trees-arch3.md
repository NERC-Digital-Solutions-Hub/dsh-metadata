# Supporting information for Traits data from juvenile trees exposed to a 50% reducing in canopy throughfall at the Caxiuanã drought experiment, Brazil, August to September 2017

## Overview
- Trait data from juvenile tropical forest trees subjected to a drought treatment via 50% throughfall exclusion (TFE) and a control plot.
- Experimental site: Caxiuanã, eastern Amazonia (1°43' S, 51°27' W). Two 1-hectare plots (TFE vs. control) with the TFE structure in place since 2002.
- Sampling in Sep–Oct 2017 (peak dry season): 76 trees total (43 control, 33 TFE), spanning size classes from 1 cm to 10 cm DBH.
- 17 traits measured per tree, with a detailed data table (Table 1) describing trait definitions, units, and plot/species context.
- Data quality and provenance are documented, with explicit quality-control steps and references to standard methodologies.

## Experimental design and sampling
- Plots: 1 ha control plot and 1 ha throughfall-exclusion plot (TFE) that reduces canopy throughfall by 50% continuously since 2002.
- Tree selection: 76 trees across common genera; efforts to represent diverse size classes (1–10 cm DBH).
- Branch sampling protocol:
  - Three branches per tree collected daily, with specific collection times to target physiological measurements.
  - Branch 1 (0430–0630): Ψpd measured after rehydration for P50 via pneumatic method.
  - Branch 2 (1000–1200): Leaves used for A–Ci curves (Li-Ci 6400) to derive Vcmax and Jmax; leaves used for leaf gas-exchange parameters (Rleaf, Min gs, Max gs) and dried for Pleaf, Nleaf, LMA.
  - Branch 3 (1300–1400): Leaves for Ψmd; branch sealed for PLC and Ksmax; LA:SA measured via leaf scanning and ImageJ.
- Data handling: quality controlled by removing values that could not be fitted to the governing equations (e.g., P50, P88, Ksmax, PLC, Vcmax, Jmax); remaining data checked against ranges reported in the literature. Missing or damaged samples are marked as NA.

## Data processing and quality control
- Outliers and non-fitting data removed where curves or equations could not be fitted (e.g., P50, P88, Ksmax, PLC, Vcmax, Jmax).
- Remaining data validated against ranges reported in related studies to ensure plausibility.
- NA denotes missing or damaged samples where data could not be collected or fitted.
- Detailed methods and variable definitions referenced from Bartholomew et al. (2020), Giles et al. (2022), Pereira et al. (2016), Pereira & Mazzafera (2012), and Schneider et al. (2012).

## Data provenance and methodological references
- P50 and P88: pneumatic method for xylem vulnerability (Pereira et al. 2016).
- Ksmax and PLC: methodology aligned with plant hydraulics and embolism assessment (Pereira & Mazzafera 2012).
- A–Ci curves and derived traits (Vcmax, Jmax) and gas-exchange measurements: Li-Cor 6400-based protocols.
- LA:SA measurement via leaf area scanning and ImageJ analysis (Schneider et al. 2012).
- Supporting literature for trait methods and quality checks: Bartholomew et al. 2020; Giles et al. 2022.

## Data availability and governance considerations
- Data are provided as supporting information accompanying the study.
- Quality assurance processes are explicitly described, with transparency about data limitations (missing values, non-fittable curves).
- Metadata includes sampling times, plot designation, species, DBH, and measurement specifics, enabling traceability and reproducibility.
- For monitoring framework purposes, notable governance considerations include:
  - The need for standardized metadata, consistent measurement timing, and documented data cleaning rules.
  - Potential data access barriers related to specialized equipment use and non-fittable measurements.
  - The importance of maintaining long-term data continuity (e.g., throughfall exclusion setup since 2002) for trend analysis.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a comprehensive trait-based approach to monitoring plant responses to climatic stress (drought) in a controlled field experiment.
- Highlights practical data lifecycle: collection, timing, measurement protocols, quality control, and metadata requirements.
- Illustrates handling of missing data and data that cannot be fitted to standard models, informing data governance and transparency needs.
- Provides a template of multi-trait data collection (physiological, anatomical, and biochemical traits) across treated and control plots, useful for evaluating policy-relevant environmental health indicators in tropical ecosystems.
