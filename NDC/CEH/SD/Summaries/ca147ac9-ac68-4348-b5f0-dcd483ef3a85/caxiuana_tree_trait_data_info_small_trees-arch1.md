# Supporting information for Traits data from juvenile trees exposed to a 50% reducing in canopy throughfall at the Caxiuanã drought experiment, Brazil, August to September 2017

## Overview
- Data come from the Caxiuanã through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in eastern Amazonia, comparing a 1 ha through-fall exclusion plot (50% exclusion) with a corresponding 1 ha control plot.
- The study provides trait data for juvenile trees collected during the peak dry season (August–September 2017) and includes 17 measured traits with mean plot-scale values reported in Table 1.

## Experimental Setup
- Location: Caxiuanã, eastern Amazonia (approx. 1°43' S, 51°27' W).
- Experimental design: Two 1 ha plots—TFE (50% canopy throughfall excluded since 2002) and a control plot without drought structure.
- Sampling period: September–October 2017 (peak dry season).

## Tree Sampling and Traits Measured
- Sampled trees: 76 individuals total (43 control; 33 TFE) across the most common genera.
- Size range: Aimed to cover different size classes from 1 cm to 10 cm DBH.
- Traits: 17 traits were measured; Table 1 provides descriptions and units, and mean plot-scale values.
- Branch sampling protocol:
  - Three branches per tree collected daily.
  - Branch 1 (0430–0630): used to measure pre-dawn water potential (Ψpd); branches rehydrated for 24 hours and used to measure P50 via pneumatic method (Pereira et al. 2016).
  - Branch 2 (1000–1200): used for A–Ci curves with Li-COR 6400 to derive Vcmax and Jmax; also measured leaf respiration in the dark (Rleaf) and stomatal conductance (Min gs, Max gs); leaves were retained for Pleaf, Nleaf, and LMA after drying.
  - Branch 3 (≥2 m, 1300–1400): measured midday water potential (Ψmd); branch sealed to measure PLC and Ksmax (Pereira & Mazzafera 2012); a 1 cm section used to measure wood density (ρ); LA:SA calculated by scanning leaves and using ImageJ to determine leaf area and sapwood area.
- Data handling: Detailed trait descriptions, units, and mean plot-scale values are provided in Table 1.

## Trait Measurement Details and Data Processing
- Measurements and methods included:
  - Ψpd and Ψmd as indicators of water status.
  - P50 and P88 (xylem pressure causing 50% and 88% loss of conductivity) using pneumatic method.
  - Vcmax and Jmax from A–Ci curves; Rleaf, Min gs, Max gs from gas exchange measurements.
  - Pleaf, Nleaf, LMA, Thickness, ρ (wood density), PLC (percent loss of conductivity), Ksmax (max lumen conductance), LA:SA.
- Data quality and curation:
  - Excluded values where curves could not be fitted or measurements could not be aligned with the underlying equations (reported as NA).
  - Remaining data checked to be within ranges reported in other studies.
