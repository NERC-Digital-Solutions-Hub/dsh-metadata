# Site description

- Location and climate
  - AFEX project area at Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (02°25' S, 59°43' W)
  - Mean air temperature: 26 °C; mean annual rainfall: 2,400 mm
  - Relative humidity: 75–92% (lowest in August, highest in April)

- Experimental setup - AFEX Experiment
  - Full factorial nutrient addition with eight treatments plus untreated control
  - Nutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and cations (K, Mg, Ca) and their combinations
  - Treatments: control, N, P, cations, N+P, N+cations, P+cations, N+P+cations
  - Experimental design: 4 independent blocks, each with 8 plots (total 32 plots)
  - Plot layout: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m; nutrient application three times per year
  - Application rates (per year): N 125 kg ha^-1 (as urea), P 50 kg ha^-1 (as triple superphosphate), Ca 50 kg ha^-1, Mg 20 kg ha^-1 (as dolomitic limestone), K 50 kg ha^-1 (as potassium chloride)

- Soil sampling
  - Conducted after seven months of nutrient addition (January 2018)
  - Three soil cores (5 cm diameter) collected per plot from central 30 m × 30 m area
  - Soils divided into depths 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm; samples composited by depth per plot with roots removed (2 mm sieve)
  - Subsamples reserved for enzyme activity assays

- Hydrolytic enzyme assays
  - Target enzymes: BG (β-glucosidase), NAG (N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase), PHOS (phosphomonoesterase) – indicators of C, N, and P cycling
  - Method: microplate fluorimetric assays (Kaiser et al. 2010)
  - Procedure: 1 g fresh soil suspended in 100 mL of 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5); ultrasonicated 1 min
  - Assay setup: 200 μL soil suspension + 50 μL MUF-substrate per enzyme (BG, NAG, PHOS) in triplicates on black 96-well plate
  - Standards and blanks prepared; incubation ~1 h at ~25 °C
  - Fluorescence read: 365 nm excitation / 450 nm emission
  - Output: enzyme activities in nmol MUF g^-1 soil dry weight h^-1

- Spreadsheet details (data structure)
  - Block: block identity (1–4) with 8 plots per block
  - Plot: description combining block and plot number (1–4, 1–8)
  - TRT: nutrient treatment applied (eight categories as above)
  - Depth: soil layer sampled (0–5 cm, 5–10 cm)
  - BG: β-glucosidase activity
  - NAG: N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase activity
  - PHOS: phosphomonoesterase activity
