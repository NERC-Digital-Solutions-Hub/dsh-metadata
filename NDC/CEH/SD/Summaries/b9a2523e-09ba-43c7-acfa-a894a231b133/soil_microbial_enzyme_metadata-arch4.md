# AFEX Experiment

## Site context and study area
- Located in the AFEX project area at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), about 80 km north of Manaus, Brazil (02° 25' S, 59° 43' W).
- Climate: mean air temperature ~26 °C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% across seasons.

## Experimental design and layout
- Full factorial nutrient addition experiment initiated May 2017.
- Treatments: untreated control plus N, P, cations (Ca, Mg, K) and their combinations: N, P, cations, N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations.
- 8 treatments total, with 4 replicate plots per treatment (32 plots total).
- Experimental blocks: 4 independent blocks, each spaced at least 250 m apart.
- Plot layout: each plot 50 m × 50 m; measurements focused on central 30 m × 30 m area.
- Nutrients applied by hand as dry granules three times per year.

## Treatments and nutrient application rates
- Nitrogen (N): 125 kg ha^-1 year^-1 as urea.
- Phosphorus (P): 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1 as triple superphosphate.
- Cations (Ca, Mg, K): 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1 Ca, 20 kg ha^-1 year^-1 Mg as dolomitic limestone, 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1 K as potassium chloride.

## Sampling and soil preparation
- Soil sampling conducted seven months after nutrient addition (January 2018).
- For each plot: three soil cores (5 cm diameter) collected within central 30 m × 30 m.
- Samples divided into depths 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm; roots removed using a 2 mm mesh sieve.
- Subsamples of fresh soil reserved for enzyme activity assays.

## Enzyme activity assays (hydrolytic) and measurements
- Target enzymes: BG (β-glucosidase; carbon cycling), NAG (N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase; nitrogen cycling), PHOS (phosphomonoesterase; phosphorus cycling).
- Method: microplate fluorimetric assay.
  - 1 g fresh soil added to 100 mL of 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), homogenized with ultrasonication (1 min).
  - 200 μL soil suspension added to black 96-well plate with 50 μL of MUF-substrates for BG, NAG, and PHOS (in triplicate).
  - Incubation: 1 hour at ~25 °C.
  - Fluorescence read at 365 nm excitation and 450 nm emission using a fluorometer.
- Output units: nmol MUF g soil dry weight^-1 h^-1.

## Data management and metadata (dictionary)
- Spreadsheet fields:
  - Block: Block identification (1–4), with 8 plots per block.
  - Plot: Plot description (block and plot number; 1–4 and 1–8 respectively).
  - TRT: Nutrient treatment applied to each plot (8 categories as described).
  - Depth: Soil depth sampled (0–5 cm, 5–10 cm).
  - BG: β-glucosidase activity (mg or μmol MUF equivalent per g soil per hour, as defined).
  - NAG: N-acetyl β-glucosaminidase activity.
  - PHOS: Phosphomonoesterase activity.
- Metadata notes: Descriptions clarify each variable, including what each enzyme measures and its role in nutrient cycling.

## Data quality, standards, and transparency
- Procedures and units clearly defined to ensure reproducibility (enzyme assays, sampling depths, plot layout, and nutrient application rates).
- Data are structured to support cross-treatment and depth comparisons, with explicit block, plot, and treatment identifiers.
