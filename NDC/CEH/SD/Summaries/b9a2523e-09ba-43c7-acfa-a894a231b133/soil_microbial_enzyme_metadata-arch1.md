# AFEX Experiment

## Site description
- Location: AFEX project area, Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.
- Coordinates: 02° 25' S, 59° 43' W.
- Climate: mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity ranges from 75% (minimum in August) to 92% (maximum in April).

## Experimental setup
- Design: full factorial nutrient addition experiment initiated May 2017.
- Treatments (8 total): control, N, P, cations (K, Mg, Ca), N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations.
- Replication: 4 independent blocks; 32 plots in total.
- Spacing: blocks separated by at least 250 m.
- Plot size and sampling area: plots 50 m × 50 m; main measurements within central 30 m × 30 m.
- Nutrient application: dry granules applied to soil surface three times per year.
- Application rates: N 125 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (urea); P 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (triple superphosphate); Ca 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹; Mg 20 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (dolomitic limestone); K 50 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ (KCl).

## Soil sampling
- Timing: after seven months of nutrient addition (January 2018).
- Sampling: three soil cores (5 cm diameter) per plot within the central 30 m × 30 m area; depths 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm.
- Processing: roots removed with a 2 mm mesh; samples composited by depth and plot.
- Subsamples: fresh soils reserved for enzyme activity assays.

## Hydrolytic enzyme assays
- Enzymes measured: BG (β-glucosidase) for carbon cycling; NAG (N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase) for nitrogen cycling; PHOS (phosphomonoesterase) for phosphorus cycling.
- Method: microplate fluorimetric assays.
- Procedure: 1 g soil in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5); homogenize; aliquot 200 μL soil suspension into 96-well plates with 50 μL of MUF-labeled substrates for BG, NAG, PHOS (x3 analytical replicates).
- Incubation: 1 h at ~25°C.
- Readout: fluorescence at 365 nm (excitation) / 450 nm (emission) using a fluorometer.
- Output: enzyme activities expressed as nmol MUF g soil dry weight⁻¹ h⁻¹.

## Spreadsheet details
- Block: block identification (1–4) where plots were installed.
- Plot: description of block/plot (1–8).
- TRT: nutrient treatment applied (8 total).
- Depth: sampled soil layer (0–5 cm or 5–10 cm).
- BG: beta-glucosidase activity.
- NAG: N-acetyl β-D-glucosaminidase activity.
- PHOS: phosphomonoesterase activity.
