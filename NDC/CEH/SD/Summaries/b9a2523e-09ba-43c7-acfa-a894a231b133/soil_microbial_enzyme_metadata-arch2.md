# AFEX Experiment

## Overview
- Location: AFEX project area at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (02°25'00'' S; 59°43'00'' W).
- Climate: mean air temperature ≈26 °C; mean annual precipitation ≈2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% (rainy season peaks in April).

## Experimental design
- Start: May 2017. Fully factorial nutrient addition experiment.
- Treatments: eight treatments including untreated control and combinations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and cations (K, Mg, Ca). Specific combinations: N, P, cations, N+P, N+cations, P+cations, N+P+cations.
- replication and layout: four replicate plots per treatment across four independent blocks (total 32 plots).
- Plot dimensions: each plot 50 m × 50 m; main measurements in the central 30 m × 30 m area; plots separated by at least 50 m.
- Nutrient application: dry granules applied three times per year at targeted rates: N 125 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (urea), P 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (triple superphosphate), Ca 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹, Mg 20 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (dolomitic limestone), K 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ (potassium chloride).

## Soil sampling & processing
- Timing: after seven months of nutrient addition (January 2018).
- Sampling: three soil cores (5 cm diameter) collected within the central 30 m × 30 m of each plot; soils separated into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths; roots removed; samples composited by depth and plot.
- Subsampling: fresh soils reserved for enzyme assays.

## Hydrolytic enzyme assays
- Enzymes measured: BG (β-glucosidase; carbon cycling), NAG (N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase; nitrogen cycling), PHOS (phosphomonoesterase; phosphorus cycling).
- Method: microplate fluorimetric assays (Kaiser et al., 2010).
- Procedure: 1 g soil in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5); ultrasonicate for 1 min; 200 μL soil suspension into 96-well plate with 50 μL substrate for BG, NAG, PHOS; three analytical replicates; blanks and standards prepared.
- Incubation & detection: 1 hour at ~25 °C; fluorescence measured at 365 nm excitation/450 nm emission.
- Output: enzyme activities reported as nmol MUF g⁻¹ soil dry weight h⁻¹.

## Data and metadata (for analysts)
- Spreadsheet fields: Block (1–4), Plot (1–8 per block), TRT (eight treatments), Depth (0–5 cm, 5–10 cm).
- Enzyme data: BG, NAG, PHOS with descriptive metadata.
- Documentation aligns with standardised monitoring data practices and supports downstream analysis and sharing.
