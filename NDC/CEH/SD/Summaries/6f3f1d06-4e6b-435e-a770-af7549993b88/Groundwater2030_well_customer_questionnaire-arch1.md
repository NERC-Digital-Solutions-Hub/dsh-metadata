# Well customer questionnaire

- Purpose and scope
  - A field instrument to collect data on groundwater use, water safety practices, storage, and alternative water sources from groundwater customers who normally buy well water.
  - Includes socioeconomic and dietary indicators (Groundwater2030) to contextualize water use and potential vulnerabilities.
  - Aims to support analysis of correlations between water access, safety practices, and household circumstances.

- Survey design and sampling
  - Target population: groundwater customers who purchase well water, selected randomly.
  - Location areas: Manyatta, Migosi, or other (specify).
  - Key identifiers gathered: Well ID, well owner name, groundwater customer name.
  - Consent: participants read a information sheet and sign a consent form; if consented, data captured in Parts 1 and 2.

- Part 1: GROUNDWATER USE (Q1–Q5)
  - Q1: Amount of well/borehole water purchased yesterday (reported as number of jerrycans; option to indicate DON'T KNOW).
  - Q2: Safety measures applied to well/borehole water for drinking (Yes/No/Don't Know); if No or Don't Know, proceed to Q4.
  - Q3: If safety measures are used, list all methods (boil, bleach/chlorine, water filter, let stand to settle, strain through cloth, solar disinfection, other). Also assess storage method after collection (uncovered small container, covered small container, uncovered/covered large container, other; circle the method storing the greatest amount).
  - Q4: Existence of other water sources besides the well/borehole (e.g., piped water, rainwater, vendors, surface water, tanker trucks, bottled water); select all that apply.
  - Q5: For each water source, indicate which purposes it is used for (drinking, cooking, hand washing, clothes washing, flushing toilet, watering crops/vegetables, water for animals, selling to others). For each purpose, capture the reason for using that source using coded responses (1 = cost/price; 2 = water quality/safety; 3 = supply reliability; 4 = ease of access; 5 = quantity; 6 = taste/odor/color; 7 = other). The table lists multiple sources (e.g., dug well, piped water, borehole, water from spring, rainwater, tanker truck, water from vendor, surface water) with corresponding purposes.

- Groundwater2030 (Q1–Q13)
  - Q1: Toilet facility type (e.g., flush/pour flush, pit latrine, composting, bucket, hangings, none/field, etc.).
  - Q2: Household assets (clock/watch, electricity, television, non-mobile telephone, refrigerator) with Yes/No/Don't Know responses.
  - Q3: Primary cooking fuel (electricity, LPG/natural gas, biogas, kerosene, coal/lignite, charcoal, wood, straw/shrubs/grass, agricultural crop, animal dung, no cooking, other); if no cooking in-house, proceed to Q6.
  - Q4: Cooking location (in the house, in a separate building, outdoors); if in a separate building or outdoors, proceed to Q6.
  - Q5: Existence of a separate kitchen room (Yes/No/Don't Know).
  - Q6: Car or truck ownership (Yes/No/Don't Know).
  - Q7: Main material of house walls (multiple options such as dirt, stone, mud; wood; bricks; cement; thatch; etc.; with an option to record other).
  - Q8: In the last seven days, number of days that main meals included meat, rice, and wheat products (record days for each).
  - Q9: In the last seven days, number of days the main meal consisted of cassava only.
  - Q10: In the last 30 days, number of days the household did not have enough to eat (zero if always enough); include DK option.
  - Q11: In the last 12 months, number of months with at least one day without enough to eat (DK option available).
  - Q12: Frequency of purchasing key staples (maize, maize meal, potatoes) with standard frequency options: Daily, Twice a week, Weekly, Fortnightly, Monthly, Less frequently than once a month.
  - Q13: Number of weeks in the past 12 months with stock of maize, maize meal, or potatoes at home (DK option available).

- Data coding and response notes
  - Several questions use coded responses (e.g., 1–7 for reasons in Q5, 1–6 for purchase frequency in Q12).
  - Some items include a DON'T KNOW option (coded as 9) to handle uncertainty.
  - The instrument uses checkbox-style, circle-one formats and open fields for specify-yourself answers (e.g., other water sources, other storage methods, other wall materials, and other kitchen/fuel details).

- Data quality and analytical potential
  - Enables linking water-use behavior with household socioeconomic indicators (assets, housing materials, cooking fuel/location) and food security measures (not enough to eat, meal composition, stock levels).
  - Facilitates analysis of how water safety practices and storage relate to source choice and consumption needs.
  - Rich for cross-tabulations by area, well source, and household characteristics, aiding identification of gaps in access, safety, and resilience.

- Practical considerations for analysts
  - Ensure proper consent verification and anonymization where needed.
  - Be mindful of recall bias in dietary and purchase-frequency questions.
  - Use well ID and area to merge with other datasets; maintain metadata for reproducibility and discoverability.
