# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- Objective
  - Conduct a follow-up study to the 2002-2004 water quality and well integrity survey in Kisumu, Kenya, to reassess groundwater safety, gather current water quality data, and describe groundwater use patterns via owner and neighbor customer interviews.
  - Expand the sample to additional neighbourhoods and boreholes; compare with baseline to identify changes over time.

- Study design and collaboration
  - International, multi-institution collaboration: University of Southampton (coordinating), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), and University of Surrey.
  - Funded by Natural Environment Research Council / Department for International Development.
  - Builds on a prior protocol and dataset (Wright et al. 2012; earlier 2002-2004 study).

- Data collection instruments and metadata
  - Pro-forma groundwater source survey for site-level data.
  - Questionnaires for groundwater source owners and for customers who buy groundwater.
  - Archiving of measurement tools and forms (e.g., GPS, photography, depth measurements, sanitary risk checklists, on-site EC measurements, laboratory analyses).

- Sampling strategy and scope
  - Sampling frame extended from 51 to 73 groundwater sources across Kisumu neighborhoods: Manyatta, Migosi, Nyalenda, Bandani, plus boreholes.
  - Sampling method: random point in each neighbourhood to select sources; boreholes selected from Water Resource Management Authority licensing records.
  - Participants: groundwater source owners and adult customers (137 customers interviewed); inclusion criteria: adults 18+, resident in selected neighbourhoods, owner or consumer of groundwater.
  - Emphasis on sources fed to neighboring households (water use and handling patterns).

- Procedures and fieldwork
  - Start-up workshop (Sept 2013) with local stakeholders.
  - December 2013: sample selection; questionnaires translated into Luo and Kiswahili.
  - January 2014: JOOUST students trained in consent and administering instruments.
  - Feb–Mar 2014: field teams revisited 2002-04 sites; owner identification, consent, GPS location, photos, depth measurement; sanitary risk assessment; two water samples collected per source (one for in-field EC, one for lab analysis); samples transported to VIRED/Surrey labs for microbiological (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical analyses.
  - Owner interviews cover water use, other water sources, assets and services (aligned to DHS-like modules) and, where relevant, food poverty indicators.
  - Customer interviews cover water use, handling, other water sources, assets and services.
  - Documentation of changes since 2004 and anonymized aggregation of results for dissemination.

- Data types and measurements
  - Physical site data: location (GPS), photos, water source depth, sanitary risk observations.
  - Water quality: electro-conductivity (in-field) and laboratory analyses for indicator bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
  - Survey data: owner and customer responses on water use, handling, access to services, and socio-economic indicators following standardized Kenyan instruments.

- Data management and quality
  - Results linked to the 2002-2004 baseline for temporal comparison.
  - Data captured via standardized forms and interview protocols; field teams cross-checked changes at sites visited in 2004.
  - Documentation and archiving of all instruments and materials for reproducibility and potential secondary analyses.

- Ethics and participant welfare
  - Informed consent obtained from all participants; procedures include information sheets in local languages.
  - Translation and back-translation of instruments to ensure comprehension.
  - Contingency for non-participation of owners or customers with alternative nearby sources or participants.

- Dissemination and references
  - Final dissemination workshop (July 2014) hosted by VIRED International for owners and community groups.
  - References include prior spatial analyses of contamination and poverty assessment tools used to inform questionnaire content.
