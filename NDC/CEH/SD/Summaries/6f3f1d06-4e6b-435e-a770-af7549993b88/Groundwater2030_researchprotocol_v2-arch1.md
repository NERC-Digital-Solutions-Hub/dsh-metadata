# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- Purpose: A follow-up survey to the 2002–2004 water quality and well structural integrity study in Kisumu, Kenya, to reassess sanitary risk, groundwater quality, and usage patterns, and to expand the sample to additional neighborhoods.

## Study design and components
- Two-part study:
  - Repeat sanitary risk inspections of wells and water quality testing.
  - Questionnaire interviews with well owners and, where groundwater is sold, with neighboring customers.
- Expanded scope: Includes additional Kisumu neighborhoods (Nyalenda and Bandani) and boreholes, building on the Manyatta and Migosi sites from the baseline study.
- Collaboration: Coordinated by the University of Southampton; partners include VIRED International (Kenya), JOOUST (Kenya), and University of Surrey.

## Sampling and participants
- Sampling frame: Based on the 2002–2004 study and extended to new neighborhoods; 73 groundwater sources tested in total (was 51 in the earlier study).
- Selection methods:
  - Groundwater sources: Random-point approach within each neighborhood to identify the nearest source; boreholes selected from Water Resource Management Authority licensing records.
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners (adults 18+).
  - Groundwater customers (adults 18+), including customers from neighboring households when water is sold locally.
- Sample sizes:
  - 73 groundwater sources.
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed.
- Inclusion criteria: Adults 18+, residents of selected neighborhoods, owner or consumer of groundwater.

## Measurement tools and data collected
- Archived instruments:
  - Pro-forma for surveying groundwater sources.
  - Questionnaires for well owners and for well customers.
- On-site and lab measurements:
  - Sanitary risk assessment of the well head and surroundings (observational checklist).
  - On-site electro-conductivity measurement.
  - Laboratory tests for microbiological indicator bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
- Ownership and usage data:
  - Amount abstracted per day, usage and handling of groundwater.
  - Other water sources used (piped water, rainwater) and asset/services access (based on DHS/Kenya tools).
- Customer data:
  - Water usage patterns, handling, and use of other water sources.
  - Household assets and access to food (poverty indicators).
- Spatial and temporal context:
  - Location coordinates recorded with GPS; changes to wells since 2004 documented where feasible.
  - Photos of groundwater sources; depth measurements where possible.

## Procedure and timeline
- 13 Sept 2013: Stakeholder workshop to raise awareness and align objectives.
- Dec 2013: Sample selection; questionnaires translated to Luo and Kiswahili.
- Jan 2014: JOOUST students trained in consent and questionnaire administration.
- Feb–Mar 2014: Fieldwork to locate sources, obtain consent, conduct sanitary risk inspections, collect water samples, and interview well owners.
  - Owners were informed about simple fixable hazards (e.g., missing covers) when identified.
- Feb–Mar 2014: JOOUST-led interviews with well owners and, where applicable, neighboring customers.
- Apr 2014 onward: Data collection continued; field teams revisited wells, verified ownership, and conducted customer interviews as needed.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop organized by VIRED International.

## Data management, quality, and outputs
- Data capture and collaboration across institutions (VIRED International, JOOUST, University of Surrey, University of Southampton).
- An evidence base for temporal change by comparing with 2002–2004 baseline data, including potential detection of changes in faecal coliforms.
- Power considerations: informal calculations suggested high power (>0.9) to detect a 0.5 log change in faecal coliforms, though no formal power calculation was conducted for the chosen sample size.
- Outputs intended for policy and practice: actionable sanitary improvements, detailed groundwater use patterns, and baseline data to inform groundwater safety in peri-urban Kisumu.

## Ethics, consent, and dissemination
- Informed consent obtained from well owners; information sheets provided in local languages.
- Training for local researchers to ensure ethical engagement and appropriate administration of instruments.
- Findings shared with local communities via stakeholder workshops and final dissemination events.

## Funding
- Natural Environment Research Council / Department for International Development.
