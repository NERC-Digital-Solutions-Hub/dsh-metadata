# Well customer questionnaire

## Purpose and aims
- A data collection instrument designed to identify environmental health measures for scrutinising and evaluating groundwater-related policy and to inform future decisions.
- Structured to gather household- and well-level information that can feed monitoring frameworks used by government departments or environmental quangos.

## Survey design and target
- Administered to groundwater customers who purchase well/borehole water, selected randomly.
- Includes respondent consent, surveyor details, area, well ID, and owner/customer identifiers.
- Aims to capture both water-related behaviours and broader living-condition indicators to support environmental health monitoring.

## Key sections and topics

- Part 1: Groundwater Use
  - Household water purchasing: quantity bought yesterday (in jerrycans).
  - Water safety practices: whether any treatment is used to make water drinkable; if yes, what methods (boiling, chlorination, filtration, sedimentation, straining, solar disinfection, etc.).
  - Water storage: method used to store water after collection (uncovered/covered containers, large vs. small, etc.).
  - Alternative water sources: existence and type of other sources (piped water, boreholes, springs, rainwater, tanker trucks, vendors, surface water, bottled water, etc.).
  - Source usage by purpose: which sources are used for drinking, cooking, handwashing, washing, toilet flushing, irrigation, animal use, and selling water to others; reasons for source choice coded (e.g., cost, safety, reliability, accessibility, quantity, taste).
  - Perceptions and constraints: potential reasons for using particular sources (via coded prompts).
  
- Groundwater2030 module
  - Sanitation facilities: type of toilet facility household members usually use.
  - Household assets and amenities: ownership of clock, electricity, television, non-mobile phone, refrigerator.
  - Cooking fuel and location: type of main cooking fuel; whether cooking is done inside the dwelling, in a separate building, or outdoors; existence of a separate kitchen.
  - Vehicle ownership: whether any household member owns a car or truck.
  - Housing characteristics: primary wall materials of the dwelling.
  - Food and nutrition indicators: frequency of meat, rice, and wheat products in main meals over the past seven days; days cassava was the main meal; experiences of food insecurity over the last 30 days and last 12 months.
  - Food purchasing and stock: frequency of purchasing maize, maize meal, and potatoes; number of weeks in the past year with a household stock of maize/maize meal/potatoes.

## Data collection details
- Data types include quantitative measures (counts, frequencies, days/weeks) and categorical classifications (types of water sources, toilet facilities, cooking fuels, building materials).
- Includes a standardized coding framework to capture reasons for water source choice (1–7 codes with an “other” option).

## Data quality and governance considerations
- Encompasses consent and confidentiality through participant information sheets and consent forms.
- Designed to facilitate data sharing and public availability of underlying data, aligning with monitoring and governance needs.
- Requires clear metadata and documentation to ensure datasets can be verified, transformed, and reused in broader monitoring frameworks.
- Potential barriers addressed implicitly: need to standardize source classifications, ensure timely data collection, and minimize silos by aligning questions with common environmental health indicators.

## How this supports monitoring frameworks (archetype perspective)
- Provides a comprehensive set of indicators across water use, water safety practices, access to water, sanitation, housing quality, and food security—key components for environmental health monitoring.
- Data can inform policy evaluation, highlight data gaps (e.g., missing metadata, inconsistent source naming), and guide future data collection efforts.
- Enables assessing progress toward improved water security, sanitation, and living conditions, while supporting governance and transparency through consent and data sharing provisions.
