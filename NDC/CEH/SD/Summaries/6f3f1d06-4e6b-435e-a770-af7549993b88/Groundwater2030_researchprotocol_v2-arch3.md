# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Overview
- Follow-up study to a 2002–2004 groundwater quality and well structural integrity survey in Kisumu, Kenya.
- Aims to reassess groundwater safety by combining sanitary risk inspection, water quality testing, and stakeholder interviews to inform policy and future decisions.
- Collaborative effort among University of Southampton, VIRED International, JOOUST, and University of Surrey; funded by NERC/DFID.

## Monitoring framework and measures
- Two-component design:
  - Repeat sanitary risk inspection of groundwater sources (wellhead and surrounding area).
  - Water quality testing of the same sources, plus expanded sampling in additional Kisumu neighborhoods.
- Social dimensions to understand groundwater use:
  - Interviews with well owners to describe extraction, handling, and alternatives (piped water, rainwater).
  - Interviews with neighbours who purchase groundwater to capture off-plot usage and demand.
  - Potentially, interviews with well customers to assess usage and assets/services access.
- Outcome focus:
  - Identify contamination hazards and actionable fixes (e.g., missing well covers).
  - Track changes in microbiological and chemical contaminants over time.
  - Describe patterns of groundwater use, sharing, and food poverty proxies.

## Sampling and participants
- Sample size: 73 groundwater sources (expanded from 51 in the earlier study).
- Sampling frame:
  - Revisit sources tested in 2002–2004 (Manyatta and Migosi) plus new neighborhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes.
  - Randomly select sources within each neighborhood; boreholes selected from groundwater abstraction license records.
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners (adults 18+).
  - Groundwater customers (neighbours who buy water, adults 18+).
  - Recruitment through owner consent and residence visits; if owner declines or source no longer exists, substitute with nearest neighboring source.

## Data collection and tools
- Field procedures (Feb–Mar 2014):
  - Location: GPS coordinates recorded; photographs taken; depth measured where feasible.
  - Sanitary risk assessment conducted via observation checklist at well head and surroundings.
  - Water samples collected: one for on-site conductivity; one for laboratory analysis.
- Laboratory analysis:
  - Microbiological indicators: thermotolerant coliforms.
  - Chemical contaminants testing.
- Questionnaires:
  - Well owner questionnaire covering abstraction, usage, other water sources, assets/services, and a food-poverty proxy (adapting Kenyan DHS instruments).
  - Well customer questionnaire covering use/handling of groundwater, other water sources, and asset/services access.
- Language and ethics:
  - Questionnaires translated into Luo and Kiswahili; informed consent obtained; data collection training for JOOUST students.

## Procedure and governance
- Stakeholder engagement:
  - Startup workshop (Sept 2013) with well owners’ associations and community groups.
  - Final dissemination workshop (July 2014).
- Data management:
  - Archiving of measurement tools and questionnaires alongside the protocol.
  - Data collection designed to re-identify and verify source owners and to document changes since 2004.
- Quality and transparency:
  - Clear procedures for consent, source identification, and substitution if a source is unavailable.
  - Use of maps and repeat visits to ensure comparability with the baseline study.

## Timeline and context
- 2013 Sept: Stakeholder workshop.
- 2013 Dec: Sample selection; questionnaires translated.
- 2014 Jan: Training on consent and administration of instruments.
- 2014 Feb–Mar: Field data collection (source re-visits, owner interviews, water sampling, customer interviews).
- 2015 Apr: Version 3 of the protocol.
- 2014 July: Dissemination workshop.

## Indicators and potential policy relevance
- Environmental health indicators:
  - Sanitary risk scores at well heads and surroundings.
  - On-site conductivity measurements; laboratory results for thermotolerant coliforms and chemical contaminants.
- Resource use indicators:
  - Volume abstraction per day (from owner reports) and sharing dynamics (customers’ usage patterns).
  - Access to alternative water sources (piped, rainwater) and related household practices.
- Social and development indicators:
  - Asset/services access and food poverty proxies to contextualize water use.
- Policy relevance:
  - Detect changes since the 2002–2004 baseline to assess effectiveness of interventions.
  - Inform targeted improvements (e.g., infrastructure, education on safe handling, access to safer water sources).
  - Provide data to guide groundwater management and public health risk reduction in peri-urban Kisumu and similar settings.
