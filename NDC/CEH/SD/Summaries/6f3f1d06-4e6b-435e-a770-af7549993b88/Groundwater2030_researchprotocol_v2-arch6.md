# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Overview
- A multi-institutional study in Kisumu, Kenya, following up on a 2002–2004 groundwater quality and well-structural integrity survey.
- Objectives: repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing, expand to additional neighbourhoods, and understand patterns of groundwater use through owner and customer interviews.
- Data focus: groundwater source locations, water quality measurements, sanitary risk observations, and socio-economic use patterns.

## Data collection and instruments
- Measurement tools archived with the protocol:
  - Pro-forma for surveying a groundwater source
  - Questionnaire for interviewing groundwater source owners
  - Questionnaire for interviewing groundwater customers
- Data collected across multiple modalities:
  - Field observations: sanitary risk assessment at the well head and surroundings
  - Geospatial: GPS coordinates, site photographs
  - Physical measurements: water depth when feasible
  - Water samples: two samples per source (one for on-site electro-conductivity, one for laboratory analysis)
  - Laboratory analyses: microbiological indicator bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants
  - Questionnaires: owner interviews and customer interviews, including use, handling, and access to other water sources, plus assets/services indicators (including poverty-related measures)
- Translation and training: questionnaires translated to Luo/Kiswahili; JOOUST staff trained in consent processes and instrument administration.

## Sampling and participants
- Sampling frame and expansion:
  - Revisited wells tested in 2002–2004; extended to additional neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and included boreholes
  - Random point sampling within neighbourhoods to select groundwater sources; boreholes selected from licensing records
- Sample size and scope:
  - 73 groundwater sources tested (up from 51 in the earlier study)
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed (people who purchase water from wells)
- Participants:
  - Adults (18+) who own groundwater sources or who purchase groundwater
  - Re-engagement with some participants from the 2002–2004 study; inclusion criteria anchored in residence in selected Kisumu neighbourhoods

## Procedure and ethics
- Timeline of activities:
  - Sept 2013: Start-up stakeholder workshop with well owners’ associations and community groups
  - Dec 2013: Sample selection; translation of instruments
  - Jan 2014: JOOUST students trained; informed consent processes prepared
  - Feb–Mar 2014: Field surveys conducted; consent obtained at each well; GPS, photos, depth, sanitary risk observations collected
  - Feb–Mar 2014 (concurrently): Owners and nearby customers interviewed using owner and customer questionnaires
  - Apr 2015: Version 3 of the protocol released
  - July 2014: Final dissemination workshop organized
- Consent and outreach:
  - Informed consent obtained from well owners; information sheets provided
  - If a well no longer existed or owner declined, nearest neighboring source was substituted
- Ethics and data handling:
  - Field team ensured ethical engagement with participants; data collected for both ownership and consumer perspectives
  - Observations and interviews designed to minimize risk and maximize data reliability

## Data management and potential outputs
- Data integration and formats:
  - Combines field observations, GPS and site data, laboratory results, and questionnaire responses
  - Data collection tools and questionnaires archived for reproducibility
- Quality and assurance considerations:
  - Repeated data collection at sources visited in 2004 to assess changes over a decade
  - Consistent data collection by the same teams (VIRED International, University of Surrey, JOOUST) across components
- Potential data products:
  - Spatial dataset of groundwater sources with attributes (location, depth, sanitary risk status)
  - Water quality results linked to specific sources and ownership
  - Descriptive analyses of groundwater use patterns among owners and customers
  - Dashboards or maps to enable stakeholders to explore sanitation risk and water quality by neighbourhood
- Dissemination:
  - Findings to be shared through stakeholder workshops and final dissemination events
  - Links to prior research (e.g., spatial analyses of contamination and poverty indicators) to contextualize results
