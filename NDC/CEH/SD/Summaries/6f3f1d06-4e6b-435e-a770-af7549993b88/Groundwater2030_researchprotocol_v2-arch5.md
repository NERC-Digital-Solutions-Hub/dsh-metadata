# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Overview
- Follow-up groundwater study in Kisumu, Kenya, expanding a 2002–2004 baseline to reassess sanitary risks, conduct water quality testing, and interview well owners and customers to describe groundwater use.
- International collaboration: University of Southampton (coordinator), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), University of Surrey; funded by Natural Environment Research Council / Department for International Development.

## Aims and design
- Two-component study: repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing of wells from the earlier study, plus questionnaires with owners and with neighbours who purchase water.
- Expanded sampling to include additional neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes; wells selected by random points near a random location in each neighbourhood; total wells tested = 73.
- Intentional mix of qualitative (owner/customer interviews) and quantitative (water quality, sanitary risk) data to describe groundwater use patterns.

## Participants and sampling
- Participants: groundwater source owners and adults who purchase groundwater (customers); some participants from the 2002–04 study re-participate.
- Recruitment: visits to homes; inclusion criteria—age 18+, resident in selected neighbourhoods, owner or groundwater consumer.
- Customer interviews: 137 customers interviewed (including some whose water is sold to neighbours).

## Data collection instruments and procedures
- Archived tools: 
  - Pro-forma for surveying a groundwater source
  - Owner questionnaire
  - Customer questionnaire
- Field procedures:
  - Informed consent in participant information sheets
  - GPS location recording and site photography; depth measurement where feasible
  - Sanitary risk assessment (on-site observation of hazards at the well head and surroundings)
  - Two water samples per source: one for on-site electro-conductivity, one for laboratory analysis
  - Laboratory processing for microbiological indicators (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants
- Owner interviews cover: daily abstraction, uses, alternative water sources, assets/services; welfare questions (food poverty) using instruments from prior Kenyan surveys
- Customer interviews cover: use/handling of groundwater, use of other water sources, assets/services

## Ethics, consent, and participation
- Start-up stakeholder workshop to raise awareness; involvement of well owners’ association and community groups
- Informed consent process with information sheets; translations to Luo and Kiswahili; procedures for substituting non-participating sites

## Data management and quality
- Data linked to the 2002–04 protocol to enable temporal comparisons
- Documentation of changes to wells since 2004; use of maps and repeated site visits by the same team for consistency
- Standardized data collection across institutions (VIRED International, JOOUST, University of Surrey)

## Data sharing, dissemination, and legacy
- Final dissemination workshop planned (July 2014) with well owners’ associations and community groups
- Measurement tools and materials archived with the protocol for reuse
- Outputs include published analyses and prior references cited (e.g., Wright et al. 2013; Zeller et al. 2003)

## Data governance considerations (Data Stewards perspective)
- Data quality and standardization across time and multiple institutions
- Linking current data with historical baseline data for comparability
- Handling sensitive information (ownership, consumption patterns) with proper consent and transparency
- Managing updates and changes to wells, ownership, and usage over time
- Accessibility of datasets and archival materials to researchers and local stakeholders, while preserving privacy and flow of information through dissemination activities
