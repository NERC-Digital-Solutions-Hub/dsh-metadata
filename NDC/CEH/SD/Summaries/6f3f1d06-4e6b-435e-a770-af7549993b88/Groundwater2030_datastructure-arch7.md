# Groundwater2030: Data structure for field survey files

- Four CSV tables are provided, each can be joined on common identifier fields
  - Groundwater2030_sanrisk.csv (sanitary risk inspection). Primary key: Wellcode
  - Groundwater2030_waterquality.csv (water quality test results). Primary key: Wellcode
  - Groundwater2030_well_owner_survey.csv (well owner questionnaire). Primary key: Well number
  - Groundwater2030_WellCustomerSurvey.csv (well customer questionnaire). Primary key: Well number
- Identifiers
  - Wellcode is the primary key for sanrisk and waterquality
  - Well number is the primary key for owner and customer surveys
  - Unique codes follow the forms W1…n, S1…n, B1…n
  - Prefix meaning: W = well, S = spring, B = borehole
  - O indicates baseline wells where water quality data could not be collected
- Relationships and data volume
  - There may be multiple customers per groundwater source
  - Owner or customer questionnaires may not link to an individual well; such records are labelled None1-n
  - All questionnaires include neighbourhood information
- Linking and data quality considerations for GIS work
  - Use Wellcode to join sanrisk and waterquality tables; use Well number to join owner and customer surveys
  - Maintain one-to-many relationships for multiple customers per source
  - Handle O-coded wells and potential missing water quality data appropriately
  - Ensure consistency of prefixes (W/S/B) when categorizing sources in spatial analyses
- Practical guidance for GIS workflows
  - Plan joins across four tables to build a comprehensive groundwater dataset
  - Validate neighbourhood data presence on all questionnaire records
  - Prepare for data gaps where linking is not possible and for baselined wells without quality data
- Key caution
  - Data may originate from multiple sources with varying resolutions; harmonize fields and keys before analysis
