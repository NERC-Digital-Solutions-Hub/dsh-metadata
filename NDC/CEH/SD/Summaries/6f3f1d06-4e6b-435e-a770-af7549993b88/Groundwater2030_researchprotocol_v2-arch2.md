# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- A follow-up survey in Kisumu, Kenya, to assess groundwater safety a decade after a 2002–2004 baseline study, with the aim of demonstrating environmental health and informing policy performance over time.

## Aim

- Revisit and extend the 2002–2004 groundwater study in Manyatta and Migosi to evaluate current water quality, well integrity, and patterns of groundwater use.
- Expand sampling to additional Kisumu neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and include boreholes.
- Combine sanitary risk inspection, water quality testing, and owner/customer interviews to build a time-consistent dataset.

## Study design and components

- Two-part approach:
  - Repeat sanitary risk inspection of groundwater sources and water quality testing.
  - Questionnaires with well owners and, where water is sold, with neighboring customers who purchase groundwater.
- Collaboration among University of Southampton (coordinating), VIRED International (Kenya), JOOUST (Kenya), and University of Surrey.

## Sampling and participants

- Sampling frame extended from the baseline 2002–2004 study; 73 groundwater sources tested (up from 51).
- Selection methods:
  - Groundwater sources in the new neighbourhoods selected by random point in each area; the nearest source to the point chosen.
  - Boreholes selected based on groundwater abstraction licence records.
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners (adults 18+).
  - Groundwater consumers, including customers who buy water from these sources (137 customers interviewed).
  - Inclusion criteria: adults 18+, resident in chosen neighbourhoods, owner or consumer of groundwater.
- Some participants re-visited from the earlier study; others newly included due to changes in ownership or new sources.

## Data collection instruments

- Pro-forma survey for surveying a groundwater source.
- Owner questionnaire (interviewing well owners).
- Well customer questionnaire (interviewing those who buy groundwater).

## Procedures and timeline

- 13 Sept 2013: Stakeholder workshop to discuss objectives and outputs.
- Dec 2013: Sample selection; translation of questionnaires (Luo and Kiswahili).
- Jan 2014: JOOUST students trained in consent and questionnaire administration.
- Feb–Mar 2014: Fieldwork involving: consent, source identification via GPS, photographic documentation, depth measurement where feasible, sanitary risk inspection, and two water samples per well (one for on-site electro-conductivity, one for laboratory analysis).
- Laboratory analyses (VIRED International and University of Surrey): microbiological (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
- Feb–Mar 2014: JOOUST-led interviews with well owners and, where applicable, customers; additional modules on water use, other water sources, assets and services, and some food poverty indicators.
- 28 Apr 2015: Version documentation of protocol.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop organized by VIRED International (participants included well owners and community groups).

## Measurements and analyses

- Sanitary risk inspection: observational checklist identifying hazards around the wellhead and immediate surroundings; immediate advisory actions for fixable hazards.
- Water quality measurements:
  - On-site electro-conductivity measurement.
  - Laboratory analyses for microbiological indicators (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
- Usage and management data: owner-reported abstraction rates, usage patterns, handling practices, and alternative water sources (piped water, rainwater).
- Socioeconomic/asset data: questionnaire sections on assets, services access, and, where relevant, food poverty indicators.

## Data management and outputs

- Tools and forms archived for reuse and transparency:
  - Groundwater source survey pro-forma.
  - Owner and customer questionnaires.
- Data products anticipated include datasets, maps, and charts illustrating groundwater safety, usage, and changes since baseline.
- Outputs designed to support long-term monitoring and policy evaluation, with emphasis on accessible underlying data for broader use.

## Collaboration, funding, and ethics

- Funders: Natural Environment Research Council / Department for International Development.
- Ethical conduct: informed consent obtained from all participants; open processes for participation and withdrawal where applicable.
- Collaborative institutions: University of Southampton (coordination), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), University of Surrey.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring

- Demonstrates a standardized, multi-component approach to monitoring groundwater safety over time, enabling trends in water quality, sanitary conditions, and usage patterns to be tracked.
- Builds on a prior baseline study to enhance dataset value, with plans to store and share datasets to support transparency and data reuse.
- Addresses key monitoring challenges by enabling data linkage across time and space and by exploring data access for broader use.
