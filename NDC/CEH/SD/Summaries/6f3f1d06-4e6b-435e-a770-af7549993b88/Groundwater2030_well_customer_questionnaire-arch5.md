# Well customer questionnaire

- Purpose and scope
  - Aimed at customers of well/borehole water, to collect data on groundwater use, safety practices, sources, storage, and related household characteristics.
  - Included only for customers where water from sampled wells is sold to others; includes consent procedures.

- Data collection flow and governance
  - Field metadata: surveyor name, date, area, Well ID, well owner, customer name.
  - Consent process: read participant information, obtain consent, and document participation status.
  - Structure: Part 1 collects groundwater use data; additional sections (Groundwater2030) capture household amenities, housing conditions, and food security indicators.
  - Data entry considerations: standardized response options, coding schemes, and handling of “don’t know” and missing responses.

- Part 1: Groundwater Use (key data domains)
  - Quantity and transaction
    - Q1: Quantity of water purchased yesterday (in number of jerrycans).
  - Water safety and treatment
    - Q2: Whether any treatment is used to make water safer to drink (Yes/No/Don't know).
    - Q3: Specific treatment methods used (boil, chlorine/bleach, water filters, settling, straining, solar disinfection, other, etc.).
  - Storage and handling
    - Q4: Household storage method (uncovered containers, covered containers, large containers/tanks, other).
  - Alternative water sources
    - Q4 (continued): Existence of other water sources (piped water, borehole, spring, rainwater, tanker truck, vendor water, surface water, bottled water, none, don't know).
  - Source usage by purpose
    - Q5: For each water source (dug well, piped Kiwasco, borehole, water from spring, rainwater, tanker truck, water from vendor, surface water), indicate use for multiple purposes (drinking, cooking, washing, cleaning, flushing toilets, watering crops/vegetables, animals, selling to others) and capture reasons for source choice with a predefined coding table (1-7) such as cost, safety, reliability, convenience, quantity, taste, or other details.
  - Context and purpose-specific notes
    - Instructions emphasize recording the reason for using a given source per purpose, enabling downstream analysis of consumption patterns and source reliability.

- Groundwater2030: Household and socio-economic context
  - Sanitation and facilities
    - Q1: Type of toilet facility used by household.
  - Household assets and utilities
    - Q2: Ownership of clock, electricity, television, non-mobile telephone, refrigerator (Yes/No/Don't know for each).
  - Cooking and housing
    - Q3: Primary cooking fuel type (electrical, LPG, biogas, kerosene, coal, charcoal, wood, straw/shrubs, agricultural by-products, animal dung, none, or other).
    - Q4-Q5: Cooking location (in house, separate building, outdoors) and presence of a separate kitchen room.
  - Transportation and construction
    - Q6: Vehicle ownership (car/truck).
    - Q7: Main wall material of dwelling (various options including dirt, wood, mud, brick, cement, stone, etc.).
  - Food security indicators
    - Q8-Q13: Food consumption and security over various timeframes:
      - Last 7 days: number of days main meals included meat, rice, and wheat products.
      - Cassava-only meals in the last 7 days.
      - Food insecurity: number of days with not enough to eat in the last 30 days; number of months with at least one day without enough to eat in the last 12 months.
      - Food stock/purchase behavior: frequency of purchasing maize, maize meal, and potatoes; number of weeks in the past 12 months with a stock of maize/maize meal/potatoes.

- Coding and response options
  - Several data points rely on predefined categories and numeric codes (e.g., Yes/No/Don't know; frequency scales such as Daily, Weekly, Monthly; coded reasons for source choice 1–7; “Don’t know” coded as 9).
  - Important for data stewardship to standardize coding to facilitate harmonization across datasets and portals.

- Data quality, interoperability, and sharing considerations for Data Stewards
  - Standardization of variables across households and wells to enable reliable aggregation (e.g., unit of measurement for water quantity, consistent source naming, uniform purpose categories).
  - Metadata completeness: ensure area codes, dates, consent status, and respondent identifiers are captured for discoverability and governance.
  - Privacy and ethics: respect consent status and limit sensitive details; implement appropriate access controls for respondent-level data.
  - Data validation: implement checks for plausible values (e.g., quantity of water purchased, food security indicators) and consistency between related questions (e.g., source used vs. purpose).
  - Data lifecycle: document updates to datasets, track embargoes or sharing limitations, and register datasets in data portals/catalogues with clear lineage.

- Practical considerations and challenges for implementation
  - Length and complexity: broad range of sources and purposes increases respondent burden and potential for missing data.
  - Incomplete or inconsistent responses: plan for handling non-responses and ambiguous answers, with clear coding guidance.
  - Interoperability: harmonize source types and purpose codes to align with other water/sanitation datasets and regional data standards.
  - Timing and logistics: ensure timely data collection and follow-up when data creators (survey teams) need to chase up responses or verify consent.

- Reuse and governance outcomes
  - Enables analysis of water source reliability, safety practices, and consumption patterns to inform water governance.
  - Facilitates assessment of household socio-economic context alongside water use, supporting integrated water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs.
  - Supports documentation of consent and data provenance for transparent data sharing and secondary research.
