# Groundwater2030: Data structure for field survey files

- Four CSV tables are provided:
  - Groundwater2030_sanrisk.csv (sanitary risk inspections)  
  - Groundwater2030_waterquality.csv (water quality test results)  
  - Groundwater2030_well_owner_survey.csv (well owner questionnaire)  
  - Groundwater2030_WellCustomerSurvey.csv (well customer questionnaire)  
- Linking keys and identifiers:
  - Tables can be joined on a set of common identifier fields that are unique to each groundwater source.
  - Groundwater2030_sanrisk.csv and Groundwater2030_waterquality.csv use Wellcode as the primary key field.
  - Groundwater2030_well_owner_survey.csv and Groundwater2030_WellCustomerSurvey.csv use Well number as the key.
- Identifier schema:
  - Unique source identifiers take the form W1好 (well), S1好 (spring), B1好 (borehole).
  - An O code indicates baseline wells for which water quality data could not be collected.
- Data relationships:
  - There may be more than one customer per groundwater source.
  - If a questionnaire cannot be linked to an individual well, it is labeled None1好, but still includes neighborhood information.
- Content of each dataset:
  - Sanitary risk: sanitary risk inspection data for groundwater sources.
  - Water quality: water quality test results for groundwater sources.
  - Well owner survey: questionnaire data from well owners.
  - Well customer survey: questionnaire data from well customers.
- Practical implications for monitoring frameworks:
  - The structure supports integrated analyses across sanitary risk, water quality, and stakeholder perspectives at the groundwater-source level using consistent identifiers.
  - Requires careful management of None and O codes, consistent metadata, and robust joining keys to maintain data quality across datasets.
