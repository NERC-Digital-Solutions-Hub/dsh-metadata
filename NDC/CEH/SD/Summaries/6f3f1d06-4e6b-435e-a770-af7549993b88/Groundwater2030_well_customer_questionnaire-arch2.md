# Well customer questionnaire

- Purpose and scope
  - Survey of groundwater customers who normally buy well/borehole water; conducted with a randomly selected customer and requires informed consent.
  - Aims to collect data on groundwater use, water safety practices, storage, alternative water sources, and household living conditions to inform environmental health and policy monitoring.
  - Survey data are intended to be standardised and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals for monitoring and scrutiny over time.

- Survey workflow and respondent handling
  - Capture: Surveyor name, date, area (Manyatta / Migosi / Other), Well ID, well owner name, and groundwater customer name.
  - Consent: Verify that the water source owner is willing to participate; record consent status and proceed to Part 1 and Part 2 if consent is given.

- Part 1: Groundwater Use
  - Q1: Amount of well/borehole water purchased yesterday (by number of jerrycans).
  - Q2: Whether any safety steps are taken to make water safer to drink; if yes, proceed to Q3.
  - Q3: Safety practices used to make water safer (e.g., boil, add bleach/chlorine, use water filter, let it settle, strain through cloth, solar disinfection, other). Also, method of storing water (uncovered small container, covered small container, uncovered/covered large container, other).
  - Q4: Existence of other water sources for the household (e.g., piped water, borehole, rainwater, tanker truck, vendors, surface water, bottled water, none, don’t know).
  - Q5: For each purpose (drinking, cooking, washing hands, washing clothes/cleaning, flushing toilet, watering vegetables/crops, water for animals, selling to others), indicate which source is used and capture reasons for each choice using coded responses:
    - Codes for reasons: 1-cost/price, 2-water quality/safety, 3-supply reliability, 4-ease of access, 5-quantity, 6-taste/smell/color, 7-other (with details in bottom row).
  - Note: The question structure requires listing all sources for each activity and allows recording “sell to other people” as a use case.

- Part 2: Groundwater2030 (household characteristics and livelihood indicators)
  - Q1: Type of toilet facility (e.g., flush/pour flush, pit latrine, composting, bucket, hanging toilet, none, other).
  - Q2: Household assets (clock, electricity, television, non-mobile telephone, refrigerator) – yes/no/don’t know for each.
  - Q3: Main cooking fuel (electricity, LPG/natural gas, biogas, kerosene, coal/lignite, charcoal, wood, straw/shrubs/grass, agricultural crop, animal dung, no cooking, other).
  - Q4: Location of cooking (in house, in a separate building, outdoors) – and if separate/outdoors, proceed to further questions.
  - Q5: Whether there is a separate kitchen room.
  - Q6: Ownership of a car or truck.
  - Q7: Main wall material of the dwelling (multiple options including dirt, stone, wood, mud, bricks, cement blocks, cement, etc.).
  - Q8: In the last seven days, how many days were certain foods (meat, rice, wheat products) served as a main meal.
  - Q9: In the last seven days, how many days was cassava the main meal.
  - Q10: In the last 30 days, how many days did the household not have enough to eat every day (food insecurity indicator).
  - Q11: In the last 12 months, how many months had at least one day without enough to eat (seasonal or intermittent food insecurity).
  - Q12: Frequency of purchase for maize (grinding), maize meal, and potatoes (daily, twice a week, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, less frequent than once a month).
  - Q13: How many weeks in the past 12 months did you have a stock of maize, maize meal, or potatoes at home.

- Data collection and outputs for environmental monitoring
  - Standardised questionnaires enable tracking of water source choices, safety practices, and storage in relation to access and cost.
  - Integration of household assets and livelihood indicators (toilet facilities, dwelling construction, cooking fuel, car ownership) with water usage patterns supports monitoring of environmental health, resilience, and policy effectiveness.
  - The dataset supports analysis of how water source selection is influenced by cost, quality, reliability, accessibility, and taste, and how these choices relate to food security and living conditions.

- Geographic and sampling specifics
  - Area options captured for context (Manyatta, Migosi, Other) to relate water use to location.
  - Focus on groundwater customers, including those who may sell groundwater to others, to understand broader water access dynamics.
