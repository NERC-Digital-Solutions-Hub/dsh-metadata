# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- A follow-up study in Kisumu, Kenya, building on a 2002-2004 baseline to assess groundwater quality, well structure, and sanitary risks, with added owner and neighbor customer questionnaires.

## Objectives and study design (GIS relevance)

- Revisit and expand the original sampling to include additional neighborhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes; aim to understand spatial patterns of groundwater use, safety, and contamination risk.
- Combine water quality data, sanitary risk assessments, and questionnaire data to support map-based analyses of spatial risk factors and trends since 2002-04.

## Geospatial data collection and sampling framework

- Sampling frame includes 73 groundwater sources across Kisumu (expansion from 51 in the earlier study).
- Groundwater sources selected by:
  - Random point in each neighborhood with the nearest groundwater source chosen.
  - Boreholes selected from groundwater abstraction licence records.
- For each source: GPS coordinates captured using handheld GPS; site photos; depth measurement where feasible.
- Objectives include mapping changes over a decade and relating location to potential contamination hazards.

## Participants and sampling strategy

- Participants: groundwater source owners and consumers; adults (18+).
- 137 groundwater customers interviewed; owners also interviewed.
- Recruitment and participation:
  - Consent obtained; information sheets provided.
  - If a well owner declined or the source no longer existed, the nearest neighboring groundwater source was visited.
  - Customer recruitment occurred at wells where water is sold, with replacement participants drawn from neighboring households if needed.

## Data collection instruments and procedures

- Tools archived:
  - Groundwater source survey pro-forma.
  - Owner questionnaire.
  - Customer questionnaire.
- Field procedures:
  - Sanitary risk inspection at wellhead and surroundings.
  - On-site measurements (electro-conductivity).
  - Water samples collected for laboratory analysis (thermotolerant coliforms and chemical contaminants).
- Owner interviews covered: water abstraction rates, usage, alternative water sources, assets/services access, and general household indicators (food poverty-related questions).
- Customer interviews covered: water use/handling, reliance on other water sources, and assets/services access.

## Data management, standards, and quality

- Data collection emphasized consistency with the baseline survey to enable spatial-temporal comparisons.
- Pro-forma and questionnaires provide structured data for GIS-ready integration.
- No formal power calculations; the extended sampling is described as pilot/follow-up to complement the baseline.

## Timeline and dissemination

- 13 September 2013: Stakeholder workshop.
- December 2013: Sample selection; translation of instruments.
- January 2014: JOOUST trained in consent and interviewing.
- February–March 2014: Fieldwork using maps from 2002-04 data; GPS capture, photography, sanitary risk assessment, and sample collection.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop.
- 28 April 2015: Version 3 of protocol.

## Collaboration and outputs for GIS

- Interinstitutional collaboration: University of Southampton (coordination), VIRED International, JOOUST, and University of Surrey.
- Expected GIS outputs:
  - Spatial dataset of 73 groundwater sources with geolocations, depth, and sanitary risk indicators.
  - Layered maps combining well locations, contamination indicators, and baseline comparison.
  - Spatial analysis of risk factors and water quality trends across neighborhoods.
- References and context: builds on Wright et al. (2013) spatial analyses and Kenyan-related survey tools.
