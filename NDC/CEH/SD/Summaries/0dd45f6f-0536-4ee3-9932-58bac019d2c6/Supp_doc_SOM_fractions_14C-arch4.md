# Radiocarbon dating of soil organic matter fractions along grassland-to-forest conversion chronosequences across Scotland

- What the dataset contains
  - Radiocarbon ages (% modern of 14C) for soil samples from the 0–5 cm mineral soil layer, spanning grasslands and mature Scots Pine plantations.
  - Samples include bulk soil and four soil fractions: dissolved organic matter (DOM), free light fraction (FLF), occluded particulate organic matter (POM), and mineral-associated organic matter (SC).
  - A single CSV file named SOM_fractions_14C.csv with five columns: sample_ID, vegetation, cluster, soil_fracion, per_modern.
  - Vegetation indicates grassland (GR) or Scots Pine plantation (OL). Cluster identifies origin site (1 Alyth, 2 Limerigg, 3 Peebles, 4 Hawick). Soil_fraction includes bulk, DOM, FLF, POM, SC. per_modern is the radiocarbon age in percent modern.

- Sampling and study design
  - Study sites located in the Scottish Central Lowlands and Southern Uplands across four clusters.
  - Grassland and mature Scot Pine plantations established on former grassland; true geographical replicates.
  - Three soil cores per site were pooled prior to analysis, yielding 8 primary samples, later fractionated into 4 fractions plus bulk for a total of 40 analyses (2 vegetation types × 4 clusters × (4 fractions + 1 bulk)).

- Methods and timeline
  - Soil samples collected in summer 2018; samples dried and fractionated.
  - Fraction analyses performed by accelerator mass spectrometry in summer 2019.
  - Authors responsible for data collection and interpretation.

- Data structure and key details
  - Data file contains 40 analysed samples across 2 vegetation types, 4 clusters, and 5 soil fractions.
  - Fractions defined as: bulk (initial non-fractionated), DOM, FLF, POM, SC (silt+clay/mineral-associated).

- Geographic coverage and coordinates
  - Located across four clusters with specific coordinates for grassland and Scot Pine samples (Cluster 1: Alyth and grassland/OL; Cluster 1: Limerigg; Cluster 2: grassland and OL; Cluster 3: grassland and OL; Cluster 4: grassland and OL).

- Relevance for data stewardship and reuse
  - Clear metadata within a single CSV file; explicit variable definitions and data provenance.
  - Suitable for analyses of mean residence time of carbon in different soil fractions under contrasting vegetation, enabling cross-site comparisons and data integration with broader soil organic matter carbon turnover studies.
