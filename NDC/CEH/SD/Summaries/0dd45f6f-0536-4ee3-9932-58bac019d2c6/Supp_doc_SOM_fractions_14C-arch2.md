# Radiocarbon dating of soil organic matter fractions along grassland-to-forest conversion chronosequences across Scotland

## Overview
- Study of radiocarbon ages (percent modern, 14C) in soil samples from the 0–5 cm mineral soil layer across grasslands and mature Scots Pine plantations in four Scottish clusters.
- Samples include bulk soil and soil fractions: dissolved organic matter (DOM), free light fraction (FLF), occluded particulate organic matter (POM), and mineral-associated organic matter (SC).
- Objective: determine mean residence time of carbon in different soil fractions under contrasting vegetation.

## Study design and sampling
- Locations: Scottish Central Lowlands and Southern Uplands, four clusters (Alyth, Limerigg, Peebles, Hawick).
- Vegetation types: grassland (GR) and Scots Pine plantation (OL) established on former grassland.
- Replication: true geographical replicates with 4 clusters; 3 soil cores per site pooled prior to analysis (total of 8 site-level samples: 2 vegetation types × 4 clusters).
- Fractionation: each pooled sample fractionated into 4 fractions plus bulk soil, yielding 40 analysed samples (2 vegetation types × 4 clusters × (4 fractions + 1 bulk)).

## Data and file structure
- Single dataset: SOM_fractions_14C.csv
- Columns:
  - sample_ID
  - vegetation (GR or OL)
  - cluster (1 = Alyth, 2 = Limerigg, 3 = Peebles, 4 = Hawick)
  - soil_fraction (bulk, DOM, FLF, POM, SC)
  - per_modern (radiocarbon age in percent modern)
- Vegetation codes: GR = grassland; OL = Scot pine plantation.
- Soil fractions defined as: bulk (initial, non-fractionated), DOM, FLF (free light fraction), POM (occluded particulate OM), SC (mineral-associated OM).

## Methodology
- Sampling: soil cores collected in summer 2018; samples dried and pooled as described.
- Fractionation: samples fractionated into four OM fractions plus bulk soil.
- Radiocarbon dating: fractionated samples analysed via accelerator mass spectrometry in summer 2019.
- Analysis scope: mean residence time of carbon inferred for each vegetation type, cluster, and soil fraction.

## Spatial and contextual details
- Geographic coordinates provided for each cluster and vegetation combination (latitude, longitude).
- Study sites established as true geographical replicates across four distinct Scottish regions.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and data use
- Provides standardized, comparable radiocarbon data across vegetation types and soil fractions to assess carbon turnover in soil under grassland-to-forest conversion.
- Data are structured for clear cross-site comparisons and integration with other environmental datasets.
- Dataset highlights: explicit metadata (vegetation, cluster, fraction type, radiocarbon age) and precise locations, enabling reproducibility and secondary analyses.
- Aligns with monitoring objectives: verification of carbon storage dynamics and soil health under land-use change, and potential to combine with other environmental datasets for broader insights.
