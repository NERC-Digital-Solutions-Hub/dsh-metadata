# Abstract

## Dataset Overview
- Stable isotope dataset (delta13C and delta15N) from two tissue types (whole blood and mantle feathers).
- 16 adults across 8 procellariiform species.
- Collected at Bird Island, South Georgia, during austral summer 2001-2002.
- Used to examine inter-specific competition during both breeding and non-breeding periods.

## Sampling Details
- Location coordinates: Bird Island, 54°00´ S, 38°03´ W.
- Species sampled: wandering albatross, grey-headed albatross, black-browed albatross, northern giant petrel, southern giant petrel, Antarctic prion, South Georgian diving petrel, common diving petrel.
- Breeding context: wandering albatross and grey-headed albatross are biennial breeders when successful; others typically breed annually.
- Sample size: 16 adults (8 male, 8 female); sex determined by morphology or genetic markers.
- Tissue collection:
  - Blood: 0.2–1.0 mL drawn from tarsal vein; processed and stored as described.
  - Feathers: 8–10 mantle feathers per individual; newer feathers selected when two generations were apparent (from most recent non-breeding period).

## Data Columns and Metadata
- Key columns: Species (common name), sp_code (numeric species type), d13C, d15N, TissueType (feather or blood), Sex (male/female; NA for diving petrels where sex labeling was ambiguous).
- Feathers were chosen to represent the most recent non-breeding period when multiple generations were present.

## Laboratory Methods and Quality Assurance
- Blood processing: centrifuged within 1–3 hours; cells and plasma separated; stored frozen at -20°C until freeze-dried and homogenised; lipids not extracted.
- Feather processing: dried, ground to a fine powder in a freezer mill at liquid nitrogen temperature.
- Isotope analysis: continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry; equipment included Carlo Erba EA linked to Finnigan Tracer Mat and Costech EA linked to Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XP.
- Quality control: three internal standards per ten unknowns; precision for both d13C and d15N ≤ 0.2‰; internal standards calibrated monthly against IAEA and NIST reference materials.

## Data Provenance and Context
- Part of long-term Bird Island research conducted by the British Antarctic Survey.
- Represents a small component used to study inter-specific competition across breeding and non-breeding periods.
