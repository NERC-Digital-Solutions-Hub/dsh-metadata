# Abstract

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset of ∂13C and ∂15N stable isotopic information from two tissue types (whole blood and mantle feathers) from 16 adults across 8 procellariiform species collected at Bird Island, South Georgia, during austral summer 2001-2002.
  - Used to examine inter-specific competition in both breeding and non-breeding periods.

- Data content and variables
  - Variables: Species (common name), sp_code (numeric species type), d13C, d15N, TissueType (feather or whole blood), Sex (male or female; NA for some diving petrels due to labeling issues).
  - Tissue types: feather (mantle) and whole blood; n = 16 individuals with 8 males and 8 females.

- Sampling details
  - Location coordinates: Bird Island, South Georgia (54°00´S, 38°03´W).
  - Breeding context: wandering albatross and grey-headed albatross are biennial breeders when successful; others typically breed annually.
  - Blood sampling: 0.2–1.0 ml from the tarsal vein; centrifuged within 1–3 hours to separate cells and plasma; stored frozen at -20°C; lipids not extracted from cells.
  - Feather sampling: 8–10 body feathers from the mantle region; newer feathers collected when two generations were evident.

- Laboratory methods and quality
  - Isotope analysis: continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry using an EA (Carlo Erba or Costech) linked to a Finnigan Tracer Mat or Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XP.
  - Calibration and standards: three internal standards per ten unknowns; measurement precision ≤ 0.2‰ for both δ13C and δ15N; internal standards calibrated monthly against IAEA and NIST references.

- Metadata and data quality
  - Clear data column descriptions provided (Species, sp_code, d13C, d15N, TissueType, Sex).
  - Noted limitation: sex labeling ambiguities for diving petrels (NA in Sex for those individuals).

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Delivers baseline isotopic data across multiple species and tissues that can inform trophic ecology and interspecific competition assessments, supporting environmental health monitoring and policy-relevant decision making.
  - Temporal scope is confined to the 2001-2002 austral summer, which should be considered when applying findings to broader monitoring contexts.
