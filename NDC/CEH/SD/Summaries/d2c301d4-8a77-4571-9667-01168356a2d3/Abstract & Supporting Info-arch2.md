# Abstract

- This dataset provides delta13C and delta15N stable isotope information from two tissue types (whole blood and mantle feathers) of 16 adults across 8 Southern Ocean procellariform species.
- Sampling occurred at Bird Island, South Georgia, during the austral summer of 2001-2002, as part of long-term British Antarctic Survey projects.
- The data have been used to examine interspecific competition during both breeding and non-breeding periods.

## Dataset scope and purpose

- Aimed at enabling comparisons of ecological niches and dietary pathways across species and seasons using standardized isotope measurements.
- Supports analyses of environmental health and species interactions within a monitored seabird community.

## Sample details

- Species sampled: wandering albatross, grey-headed albatross, black-browed albatross, northern giant petrel, southern giant petrel, Antarctic prion, South Georgian diving petrel, common diving petrel.
- Sex distribution: 16 adults evenly split (8 males, 8 females) determined by morphology or genetic markers.
- Blood samples: 0.2–1.0 ml collected from the tarsal vein; processed within 1–3 hours to separate cells and plasma; plasma stored freeze-dried/at -20°C; lipids not extracted from blood proteins.
- Feather samples: 8–10 mantle feathers per individual, collected from the same birds; newer feathers from the most recent non-breeding period selected when multiple generations were present.

## Variables and data structure

- Species (common name) and sp_code (numeric species type).
- Isotopes: d13C and d15N values.
- TissueType: feather or whole blood.
- Sex: male or female; not assigned for diving petrels due to labeling ambiguity (NA).

## Analytical methods and quality control

- Isotope analysis performed via continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry.
- Instrument chain: Carlo Erba EA, Finnigan Tracer Mat, Costech ECS 4010 EA, Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus XP.
- Internal standards: three per ten unknown samples; precision for d13C and d15N ≤ 0.2‰.
- Standards calibrated monthly against IAEA and NIST reference materials to ensure accuracy and comparability.

## Data handling and stewardship

- Part of a larger, long-term monitoring program; designed for consistent storage and potential uploading to appropriate data portals.
- Data collection and analysis follow standardized procedures to enable cross-study comparability and temporal trend assessment.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring and challenges

- Demonstrates a standardized approach to capturing ecological interactions and resource use across species, contributing to assessments of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Key challenges align with analysts’ goals: increasing dataset value through integration with other data sources and improving access to underlying data for broader reuse and scrutiny.
