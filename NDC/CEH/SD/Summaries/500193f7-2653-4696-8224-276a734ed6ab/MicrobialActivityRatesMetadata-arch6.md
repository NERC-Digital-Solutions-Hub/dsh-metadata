# Experimental Design and Laboratory Incubation Method

- Overview
  - Sediment samples collected from Wood Brook, Staffordshire, UK, at 0–10 cm depth in June 2015.
  - Two locations: sandy mid-stream reach and gravel downstream reach.
  - Five pseudo-replicates per location; samples homogenised, sieved (2 mm) and stored cold within 36 hours.
- Experimental design and sampling
  - Multiple assays conducted to assess microbial activity and sediment chemistry:
    - Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis to indicate general hydrolytic activity.
    - Extracellular phenol oxidase activity using L-DOPA as substrate.
    - Denitrification potential under anoxic conditions with various substrate amendments (control, nitrate-spiked, carbon-spiked, nitrate+carbon-spiked).
    - Organic matter content by loss on ignition (LOI).
    - Moisture content and pH of sediments.
  - Denitrification incubation specifics:
    - 10 g field-moist sediment in 100 mL serum bottles, dark conditions, cold pre-incubation.
    - 20 mL of appropriate stock solutions added (control: water; nitrate 30 mg L-1 NO3; carbon: 40 mg L-1 glucose; mixed: 30 mg L-1 NO3 and 40 mg L-1 glucose-C).
    - Incubations at 22 °C with shaking; headspace sampled at 0, 3, and 6 hours.
    - Headspace purged with argon; 10% of headspace replaced with argon:acetylene to inhibit N2O reduction to N2.
- Analytical measurements and procedures
  - Fluorescein and dopachrome measurements:
    - FDA hydrolysis: absorbance at 490 nm after incubation and quenching with acetone.
    - Dopachrome formation (phenol oxidase activity): absorbance at 475 nm after L-DOPA reaction.
  - Denitrification products:
    - Nitrous oxide concentrations measured via gas chromatography with micro electron capture detector (GC-ECD).
  - Other measurements:
    - Organic matter by LOI after combustion at 550 °C.
    - Moisture content by drying field-moist sediment at 105 °C.
    - pH of sediment slurries prepared with deionised water; pH measured after settling.
- Instrumentation and calibration
  - GC-ECD for N2O concentrations (Agilent 7890A) with 1 mL loop, splitless mode; run time ~9 minutes.
  - UV-Vis spectrophotometry for fluorescein (490 nm) and dopachrome (475 nm) (Varian Cary).
  - pH measurement with a portable pH probe (HQ40d).
  - Calibration:
    - GC-ECD: four-point N2O standard (0, 2, 4, 6 ppm) with zero nitrogen as a blank.
    - pH: buffers at pH 4.00 and 7.00.
