# Materials and Methods for 'Bioavailability and toxicity of nanomaterials in sewage sludge to earthworms' data

## Objective
- Assess bioavailability and toxicity of nanomaterials (ZnO ENM, Ag ENM, TiO2) and ionic metals to Eisenia fetida in soil–sludge mixtures.
- Compare ENM versus ionic metal effects on survival, reproduction, and tissue metal uptake.
- Measure porewater concentrations and correct tissue concentrations for gut residues to improve interpretation of uptake.

## Experimental design
- Soil and sludge setup:
  - Sandy loam soil (Woburn, UK) amended with sewage sludge derived from spiked wastewater treatment plant influent.
  - Sludges prepared to create three metal treatment regimes:
    - ENMs: ZnO (30 nm, uncoated), Ag (50 nm, PVP-stabilized), TiO2 (27 ± 7.5 nm).
    - Ionic/metals: ZnSO4, AgNO3, and micron-sized TiO2.
    - No-metal control.
  - Target Zn concentrations based on regulatory guidance to simulate realistic loading; total sludge produced ~40 kg dry weight per plant for use in earthworm tests.
- Sludge-to-soil ratio:
  - 0.58:0.42 (soil:sludge) to achieve approximately 1400 mg Zn/kg dry soil in the ionic metal treatment, aligned with EPA biosolids guidelines (Part 503) and top 15 cm soil after 10 years at max Zn concentration.
- Aging:
  - Mixtures aged in outdoor lysimeters for six months prior to earthworm exposure.

## Treatments and controls
- Four replicated soil–sludge treatments plus soil-only controls:
  - 1) Control soil–sludge (no metal addition).
  - 2) High-metal ENM soil–sludge.
  - 3) High-metal ionic metal soil–sludge.
  - 4) Low-metal ENM soil–sludge (1:1 mix with control soil–sludge).
  - 5) Low-metal ionic metal soil–sludge (1:1 mix with control soil–sludge).
- Fully replicated soil-only control (no sludge) included to document reproductive response per OECD guidelines.

## Exposure and endpoints
- Replication and setup:
  - Four replicate containers per soil–sludge treatment (≈300 g dry weight per container); eight soil controls with similar volume.
  - Soils adjusted to 50% water holding capacity and pre-equilibrated for ten days before introducing organisms.
- Test organism and conditions:
  - Eisenia fetida, groups of ten earthworms per replicate.
  - Maintenance: 20 ± 1 °C, 12:12 h light:dark cycle.
  - Feeding: Horse manure added to soil-only controls; no food added to soil–sludge treatments (sludge as food source).
- Measured endpoints and timing:
  - Survival and batch weight at 14 and 28 days.
  - At 28 days: surviving adults removed; three individuals per replicate prepared for tissue Zn/Ag analysis after gut purge (24 h) to minimize soil in gut.
  - Reproduction: after an additional 28 days (total 56 days), cocoons hatch and juveniles counted to verify OECD guideline criteria (>30 juveniles).
- Single-compound controls:
  - Separate exposures using as-synthesized ZnO ENM, PVP-coated Ag ENM, Zn(NO3)2, and AgNO3.
  - Spiked soils with Zn (100–2200 mg/kg) or Ag (9–880 mg/kg) in triplicate.
  - 28-day survival and 56-day reproduction tests conducted; three surviving adults prepared for tissue analysis as above.

## Soil porewater extraction
- Rationale: porewater is a key uptake route for ionic metals.
- Procedure:
  - At 56 days, two 20 g soil samples per replicate (dry weight) saturated to 140% WHC, equilibrated overnight.
  - Porewater extracted by centrifugation (4000 g) for 1.5 h.
  - 5 mL porewater per replicate analyzed by ICP-OES for Zn or Ag; pH measured.
  - For Ag, filtration steps included glass wool and CuSO4-treated filters to minimize Ag ion adsorption and losses.
  - Ultra-filtration (5 mL) used to obtain ultra-filtered porewater for analysis.

## Chemical analysis and tissue processing
- Digestion and preparation:
  - Soil, soil–sludge, or whole earthworm samples: ~0.75 g soil-based material or 0.5 g freeze-dried earthworm tissue.
  - Digestion with 3:1 HCl:HNO3 at 140 °C for 2.5 h; cool and filter through pre-treated filter papers; final volume 50 mL with 0.5% v/v HNO3.
  - Porewater digested with 3:1 acids in microwave digestion, final volume 50 mL with 1% v/v HCl.
- Instrumentation:
  - Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS): Perkin Elmer Nexion 300D.
  - Digestion efficiency, calibration, and method details described in Supporting Information.
  - Detection limit for Ag: 0.14 µg/L; precision around 1.4% at 5 µg/L.
- Tissue correction for gut residues:
  - Aluminum (Al) used as a natural, non-bioavailable surrogate to correct gut-associated metal residues.
  - Correction formula: M_worm_corr = M_worm − m × Al_worm (where m is the slope from linear regression of worm metal vs. worm Al; separate regressions for each exposure type).
  - Applied to total Ag and Zn concentrations in earthworms exposed to ENM or ionic metal sludges.

## Quality assurance and data handling
- Digestion efficiency, instrument calibration, and method reproducibility ensured per standard protocols.
- Data include tissue concentrations corrected for gut residues, porewater concentrations, survival, reproduction counts, and body weights.
- All procedures referenced established guidelines (OECD 222) and prior studies for comparability.
