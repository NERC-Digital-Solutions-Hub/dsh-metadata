# Bioavailability and toxicity of nanomaterials in sewage sludge to earthworms

- Objective and scope
  - Assess bioavailability and toxicity of nanomaterials (ZnO ENM, Ag ENM, TiO2 ENM) in sewage sludge when applied to soil and exposed to earthworms (Eisenia fetida).
  - Compare ENMs with ionic metal forms (ZnSO4, AgNO3) and a no-metal control.
  - Include aged sludge in soil-sludge mixtures and evaluate survival, reproduction, and tissue metal concentrations.

- Materials and sludge/soil preparation
  - Sandy loam soil (Woburn, U.K.) amended with sludge derived from WWTP influent spiked with:
    - ENMs: ZnO (30 nm, uncoated), Ag (50 nm, PVP-coated), TiO2 (27±7.5 nm)
    - Ionic/bulk metals: ZnSO4, AgNO3, and micron-sized TiO2
    - Control with no metals
  - Target sludge concentrations: Zn in sludge ~2800 mg/kg dry mass; Ag ~100 mg/kg; Ti ~2400 mg/kg; Zn target in ionic metal sludge adjusted to achieve 1400 mg/kg dry soil in the 0.58:0.42 soil:sludge mix.
  - Sludge produced in four pilot runs (40 kg dry sludge per plant) and aged in outdoor lysimeters for six months.
  - Final soil-sludge mixtures: 0.58 soil : 0.42 sludge; top 15 cm after 10 years of application per guidelines.

- Experimental design and exposure setup
  - Four replicate containers per soil-sludge treatment (plus eight soil controls for volume parity).
  - Each replicate contains 300 g dry weight of soil-sludge mix; soil controls ~550 g dry weight.
  - Moisture adjusted to 50% water holding capacity with deionised water; pre-exposure stabilization for 10 days.
  - Earthworms: Eisenia fetida, groups of ten per replicate; food provided only to soil-only controls (horse manure); no food added to soil-sludge treatments (sludge serves as food source).
  - Exposure duration: 28 days for survival and body weight measurements (taken at 14 and 28 days); surviving adults depurated and prepared for tissue analysis; 28 days allowed for cocoon and juvenile development; a subsequent 28-day period to count juveniles (total 56 days for reproduction assessment).
  - Fully replicated treatment including a soil control without sludge to ensure adequate reproduction evidence (minimum OECD guideline requirements).

- ENM vs ionic metal comparison experiments
  - Separate single-compound exposures using as-synthesized ZnO ENM (ZnO ENM 30 nm) and PVP-coated Ag ENM, and salts ZnNO3 and AgNO3.
  - Spiking and dosing mirrored the sludge experiments; same soil and exposure conditions.
  - Concentration ranges for single-compound exposures:
    - Zn: 100, 225, 500, 1100, 2200 mg Zn/kg
    - Ag: 9, 22.5, 56.3, 141, 352, 880, 2200 mg Ag/kg
  - After 28 days, three surviving adults per replicate prepared for tissue Zn/Ag analysis; minimum replication limited by sludge production.

- Earthworm endpoints and sampling
  - Survival and weight recorded at 14 and 28 days.
  - Reproduction: number of juveniles counted after 56 days (post cocoon hatching).
  - Tissue analysis: three surviving adults per replicate collected, washed, depurated, and stored for Zn/Ag analysis.

- Porewater extraction and analysis
  - Soil porewater collected to assess uptake route for ionic metals.
  - Procedure: centrifuge soil-sludge samples after saturation to 140% WHC; extract porewater, filter to minimize adsorption losses ( Ag samples filtered through CuSO4-treated filters to reduce Ag loss).
  - Analytical measurements: Ag and Zn in porewater by ICP-OES; pH measured.

- Chemical analysis and tissue digestion
  - Digestion: ~0.75 g soil/sludge or 0.5 g earthworm tissue digested with a 3:1 HCl:HNO3 mixture at 140°C for 2.5 h; post-digestion dilution to 50 ml with 0.5% HNO3; porewater digests prepared with closed-vessel microwave digestion and diluted to 50 ml with 1% HCl.
  - Analysis: ICP-MS for metals (Ag and Zn) in soil, porewater, and earthworm tissues.
  - Quality assurance: digestion efficiency, instrument calibration, and method validation referenced in Supporting Information; instrument detection limit for Ag ~0.14 µg/L with ~1.4% precision at 5 µg/L.

- Data handling and gut-content correction
  - Total metal concentrations in earthworms corrected for gut residues using aluminum as a naturally occurring, largely non-bioavailable gut-residue proxy.
  - Correction method: M_worm,sum_corr = M_worm,sum − m × Al_worm,sum, where m is the slope from linear regression of metal vs. Al concentrations for each exposure group.
  - Separate regressions performed per exposure group; corrections applied for Ag and Zn in ENM- and ionic-metal exposures when significant relationships were detected (p < 0.05).

- Data interpretation and reporting
  - Comparative analysis across ENM and ionic metal treatments, including surface vs internal tissue burdens, survival, and reproduction endpoints.
  - Use of OECD guideline 222 for earthworm reproduction test to standardize endpoints and comparability.

- References and context
  - Key references include OECD guidance, EPA biosolids risk assessments, and related studies on nanomaterials in biosolids and soil systems.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a rigorous, standardized approach to generating and analyzing environmental health endpoints (survival, reproduction, tissue burdens) in a controlled mesocosm context.
  - Emphasizes data quality, QA/QC procedures, and the need to address data interpretation challenges such as gut-content correction and porewater contributions.
  - Provides a framework for comparing nanoscale vs bulk/ionic metal forms and for integrating complex exposure media (sludge-amended soils) into monitoring programs.
