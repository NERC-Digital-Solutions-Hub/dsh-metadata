# Materials and Methods for 'Bioavailability and toxicity of nanomaterials in sewage sludge to earthworms' data.

- Objective and scope
  - Assess bioavailability and toxicity of nanomaterials (ZnO ENMs, Ag ENMs, TiO2 ENMs) and corresponding ionic/bulk metals in sewage sludge amended soil to the earthworm Eisenia fetida.
  - Compare effects of ENMs vs. ionic/bulk metal forms on survival, growth, and reproduction; quantify metal uptake in earthworms; examine porewater as an uptake route.

- Sludge production and soil-sludge media
  - Sludge prepared from spiked wastewater treatment plant influent with three amendment types:
    - ENMs: ZnO (30 nm, uncoated), Ag (50 nm, PVP-coated), TiO2 (27±7.5 nm)
    - Ionic/bulk metals: ZnSO4, AgNO3, and micron-scale TiO2
    - No metals (control)
  - Target sludge metal loadings:
    - Zn: 2800 mg Zn/kg dry sludge (aimed for regulatory relevance)
    - Ag: 100 mg Ag/kg dry sludge
    - Ti: 2400 mg Ti/kg dry sludge
  - Sludge to soil ratio: 0.58:0.42 (soil:sludge) to achieve ~1400 mg Zn/kg dry soil in ionic-metal treatments, based on US EPA guidance and a 1:1 soil:sludge topsoil ratio after 10 years of application.
  - Aging: mixtures aged in outdoor lysimeters for six months to create aged soil-sludge media.

- Experimental treatments and replication
  - Four replicate containers per soil-sludge treatment (300 g dry weight per replicate).
  - Eight soil controls (550 g dry weight) to match soil volume across media types.
  - Four main soil-sludge treatments plus corresponding sub-treatments created by mixing in control soil-sludge in a 1:1 ratio to create:
    - High-metal ENM soil-sludge
    - High-metal ionic metal soil-sludge
    - Low-metal ENM soil-sludge
    - Low-metal ionic metal soil-sludge
  - Fully replicated soil control (no sludge) included to ensure OECD-based reproduction assessment thresholds.

- Earthworm exposure and culture
  - Species: Eisenia fetida (andrei)
  - Source: commercial supplier; maintained in culture soil at 20 ± 1 °C, 12:12 h light:dark
  - Group setup: ten fully-clitellated earthworms per container
  - Feeding: organic matter provided only to soil controls (horse manure, dry weight 10 g) to standardize food across controls; no food added to sludge-treated media (sludge provides food source)
  - Exposure durations and measurements:
    - Survival and batch weight measured at 14 and 28 days
    - Surviving adults removed at 28 days; 3 adults per replicate prepared for tissue analysis after a 24-hour purge
    - After 28 days, remaining media incubated for an additional 28 days to allow cocoons/juveniles; juveniles counted
  - Additional single-compound exposures (comparison to ENMs and sludge treatments) included:
    - Spiked soils with as-synthesized ZnO ENM (ZnO NP) and PVP-coated Ag ENM and with Zn(NO3)2 and AgNO3
    - Same test procedure as sludge exposures; durations matched (survival at 28 days; reproduction assessment)

- Porewater extraction
  - Rationale: porewater is a key uptake route for ionic metals
  - Procedure: end-of-exposure (56 days) porewater extraction from each replicate
    - Samples collected from 2× 20 g composite soil portions (dry weight equivalent), saturated to 140% water holding capacity, equilibrated overnight
    - Centrifugation to extract porewater; Ag samples filtered with CuSO4-treated filters to minimize Ag adsorption
    - Ultra-filtration (5 mL porewater in 10 kD device) to obtain porewater fractions
    - Analytes (Zn and Ag) analyzed by ICP-OES; pH measured

- Chemical analyses and tissue metal quantification
  - Digestion for soil, soil-sludge mixtures, and earthworm tissue:
    - ~0.75 g soil or 0.5 g dried earthworm tissue digested with 3:1 HCl:HNO3 at 140 °C for 2.5 h
    - Post-digestion, samples filtered and brought to 50 mL with 0.5% v/v HNO3
    - Porewater digested with 3:1 acids in closed vessels; final volume 50 mL with 1% HCl
    - Analyses by ICP-MS (Perkin Elmer Nexion 300D)
  - Quality control
    - Digestion efficiency checks, instrument calibration, and method details provided in Supporting Information
    - Detection limit for Ag by ICP-MS: 0.14 μg/L; precision around 1.4% at 5 μg/L
  - Tissue metal corrections
    - Corrections for gut contents performed using aluminum (Al) in soil and worm tissue, exploiting Al’s natural soil-associated background
    - Regression-based correction: M_worm,corr = M_worm − m × Al_worm
      - Separate regressions for each exposure type (ionic vs ENM)
      - Applied to total Ag and Zn concentrations in earthworm tissues to account for residual gut material

- Data interpretation and standards
  - Comparisons drawn between ENM and ionic/bulk metal exposures as separate single-compound tests
  - Endpoints include survival, growth (bulk weight), reproduction (juvenile count), and tissue/bulk metal concentrations
  - Protocol aligns with OECD Test No. 222 (Earthworm Reproduction Test) and related literature on nanomaterial fate and bioavailability in biosolids

- References and foundational guidelines
  - Established methods for nanoscale metal fate in biosolids and soils
  - OECD 222 guideline for earthworm reproduction
  - Supporting information provides additional methodological details and QA procedures

- Data quality and monitoring implications
  - Use of standardized, replicated experimental design enables temporal and treatment-based comparison
  - Integration of porewater measurements and tissue analyses supports robust assessment of bioavailability pathways
  - Corrections for gut residues improve accuracy of tissue metal burden estimates
  - Data produced from this study can be added to monitored environmental datasets for evaluating nanomaterial risks in biosolids amended soils
