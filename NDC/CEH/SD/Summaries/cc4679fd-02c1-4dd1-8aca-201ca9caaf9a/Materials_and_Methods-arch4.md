# Materials and Methods for 'Bioavailability and toxicity of nanomaterials in sewage sludge to earthworms' data.

## Overview
- Evaluates toxicity of nanomaterials (ZnO, Ag, TiO2) in biosolids to Eisenia fetida using aged soil-sludge mixtures.
- Compares ENM forms with ionic metal forms and a no-metal control across multiple endpoints: survival, growth, reproduction, and tissue metal burdens.
- Generates diverse data streams: organism endpoints (survival, weight, juvenile production), tissue concentrations (Zn, Ag), soil-porewater concentrations, and associated pH measurements.

## Experimental materials
- Soil: Woburn sandy loam (UK).
- Sludges: sewage sludge produced by spiking wastewater treatment plant influent with either ENMs (ZnO 30 nm uncoated; Ag 50 nm PVP-coated; TiO2 27±7.5 nm) or ionic metals (ZnSO4; AgNO3) or no metals (control).
- Targeted concentrations linked to regulatory guidance: Zn ~2800 mg/kg in sludge; resulting target Zn in ionic metal treatment ~1400 mg/kg in dry soil when mixed 0.58 soil:0.42 sludge.
- Sludges aged in outdoor lysimeters for six months prior to exposure.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Four replicate containers per soil-sludge treatment (300 g dry weight per container) and eight soil controls for comparability.
- Exposure media prepared as 0.58:0.42 soil:sludge ratio; aged mixtures to reflect long-term application.
- Treatments:
  - Control soil-sludge (no metal).
  - High-metal ENM soil-sludge.
  - High-metal ionic metal soil-sludge.
  - Low-metal ENM soil-sludge (1:1 mix with control sludge).
  - Low-metal ionic metal soil-sludge (1:1 mix with control sludge).
- A fully replicated soil-only control (no sludge) included to ensure adequate reproduction data per OECD guidelines.

## Earthworm exposure and organism endpoints
- Species: Eisenia fetida.
- Setup: groups of ten fully-clitellated earthworms introduced to each replicate; food provided only in soil control treatments (horse manure) and not in sludge treatments (sludge itself serves as a food source).
- Conditions: 20 ± 1 °C, 12:12 h light:dark cycle, 50% water holding capacity.
- Timeline and measurements:
  - Survival and fresh weight at 14 and 28 days.
  - After 28 days, adult earthworms depurated and three worms per replicate analyzed for tissue metal content.
  - Earthworms returned to containers, with media incubated for an additional 28 days to allow cocoon hatching; juveniles counted at 56 days.

## Single-compound control exposures
- ENMs: as-synthesised ZnO and PVP-coated Ag nanoparticles (Zn or Ag exposures).
- Ionic controls: ZnSO4 and AgNO3.
- Dosing: multiple concentration levels (Zn: 100–2200 mg/kg; Ag: 9–880–2200 mg/kg) applied to the same soil type and tested under the same 28- to 56-day timelines as the sludge treatments.
- Purpose: compare ENM versus ionic metal toxicity under equivalent exposure protocols.

## Soil porewater analysis
- Rationale: porewater is a key uptake route for ionic metals.
- Method: end-of-exposure porewater extraction via centrifugation from each replicate.
- Samples: two 20–25 g soil aliquots per replicate for Zn and Ag.
- Processing: up to 140% saturation, overnight equilibration; porewater filtered (Ag samples treated to minimize adsorption losses); 5 mL aliquots subjected to 10 kDa ultrafiltration.
- Analysis: ICP-OES for Zn and Ag; pH measured in parallel.

## Chemical analysis and tissue burden
- Digestion:
  - Soil/sludge: ~0.75 g; earthworms: ~0.5 g; acids: HCl–HNO3 (3:1); digestion at 140 °C for 2.5 h, then cooled and diluted to 50 mL.
  - Porewater: 1 mL aliquot digested with HCl–HNO3 in closed vessels; diluted to 50 mL with 1% HCl.
- Instrumentation: ICP-MS (Perkin Elmer Nexion 300D).
- Quality and calibration: digestion efficiency checks, instrument calibration details provided in Supporting Information; Ag method detection limit ~0.14 μg/L; precision ~1.4% at 5 μg/L.
- Data corrections: total metal concentrations in earthworms corrected for gut residues using Al as a conservative tracer:
  - Correction formula: M_worm_corr = M_worm - m × Al_worm
  - m = slope from regression of worm metal vs. worm Al; separate regressions per exposure type.
  - Rationale: Al is naturally present in soil and largely non-bioavailable; ensures tissue burdens reflect uptake rather than residual gut contents.

## Data management and reporting
- Data types generated include: survival, growth (weight), reproduction (juvenile counts), adult metal body burdens (Zn, Ag), soil porewater concentrations, and soil pH.
- Data generated and analyzed under standardized, OECD-compliant protocols; comprehensive methodological details and QA steps are documented, with Supporting Information covering digestion and calibration procedures.
