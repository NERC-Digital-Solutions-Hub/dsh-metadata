# Digital elevation models (DEMs) of difference (DoD) for avalanche-debris flow in Chamoli District, Uttarakhand, India

## Overview
- DoD rasters quantify vertical (z) topographic change between two dates and are used in GIS for landscape change analysis and supporting numerical modelling.
- Created to analyze landscape change after the avalanche-debris flow on 7 February 2021 in Chamoli District, Uttarakhand, India, and to support CAESAR-Lisflood modelling.

## Data content and purpose
- DoDs are raster (.tif) products generated by subtracting a later DEM from an earlier DEM; negative values indicate surface lowering (erosion) and positive values indicate surface gain (deposition).
- Each DoD represents a specific period between two dates, as indicated by the file naming.

## Geographic and temporal coverage
- Spatial extent described by bounding box in WGS84 / UTM Zone 44:
  - Top left: 352312 m E, 3385209 m N
  - Lower right: 384787 m E, 3358896 m N
- DoD data underpinning the DoDs were generated between 10 February 2021 and 27 April 2022; DoDs were created on a rolling basis within this window.
- DoD file names indicate the period spanned (e.g., YYMMDD_YYMMDD_DoD.tif). A separate composite from September 2015 is also included as 1509_DoD.

## Data collection and processing
- DoDs produced in QGIS (versions 3.18 and 3.24) using the Raster Calculator tool.
- For each DoD, the later DEM is subtracted from the earlier DEM.
- The project Principal Investigator (PI) created all DoDs.

## Completeness and lineage
- The dataset is complete in terms of the DoDs generated as part of this research.
- Additional DoDs could be generated using alternative input DEM pairs; users can replicate the method described for estimating significant-change thresholds described in section 5.

## Quality control, uncertainty, and significance
- Holes or data gaps in input DEMs are reproduced in corresponding DoDs due to photogrammetric reconstruction issues (cloud cover, occlusion, misalignment, etc.).
- A statistically significant change threshold for each DoD was estimated using 16 stable hillside areas identified via Pléiades orthoimagery; standard deviation within these areas informs a two-sigma DoD uncertainty.
- DoD uncertainties (two-sigma) by period:
  - Sep 2015 – 10 Feb 2021: ±1.11 m
  - 10 Feb 2021 – 06 Jun 2021: ±0.91 m
  - 06 Jun 2021 – 25 Dec 2021: ±0.61 m
  - 10 Feb 2021 – 25 Dec 2021: ±1.14 m
  - 10 Feb 2021 – 27 Jan 2022: ±1.06 m
- Stable-area polygons used for uncertainty assessment are provided with the dataset.

## Dataset structure and file inventory
- DoD raster files:
  - 1509_composite_210210_DoD.tif
  - 210210_210606_DoD.tif
  - 210606_211225_DoD.tif
  - 210210_211225_DoD.tif
  - 210210_220127_DoD.tif
- Stability reference:
  - stable_areas.shp (plus auxiliary files: .cpg, .dbf, .prf, .qmd, .shx)
- Naming convention:
  - Filenames reflect the two dates spanned by the DoD; “1509” denotes September 2015 for the composite DoD.

## Provenance and responsibility
- Responsibility for the collection and interpretation of the data lies with the project Principal Investigator (PI), who created all DoDs using the described methods.

## Data governance, interoperability, and reuse
- Data are provided as standard GIS-friendly formats (TIFF rasters and shapefiles) suitable for sharing within the community of practice.
- Methodology is described to enable reproduction and replication of DoDs and significance thresholds.
- DoDs include metadata within the accompanying documents and the stable-area polygons to support independent verification of significance and uncertainty.
- Data governance considerations highlight potential limitations when dealing with holes and non-interoperable inputs in prior datasets; the current DoDs address these by providing stable-area-based uncertainty and full documentation of processing steps.
