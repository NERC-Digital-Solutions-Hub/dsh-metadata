# Methods, metadata and summary for fish monitoring at Akrotiri up to 22 nd March 2019 (IJW)

- Project context and aims
  - Part of Defra Darwin Initiative Plus Project DPLUS056: Assessment and monitoring of current and future IAS in Cyprus to establish baseline data on native and non-native fish populations in the Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri.
  - Organizations involved: CEH (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Joint Services Health Unit, Akrotiri Environmental Education Centre, Water Development Board of Cyprus.
  - Goal: collect baseline fish data to inform understanding of native vs non-native species presence and distributions.

- Methods: trapping, nets, and surveys
  - Primary trapping method: baited mesh traps (55 x 24 x 24 cm, 3 mm mesh), baited with halibut pellets.
  - Trap configurations:
    - Submerged: placed on the water body bottom inshore, depth up to ~1 m.
    - Semi-submerged: traps positioned so openings span the water surface inshore.
  - Exploratory trials used underwater video to assess trap performance; regular monitoring followed with two trap configurations deployed per water body for ~24 hours per session.
  - Additional sampling tools:
    - Two bottom-set CEN standard nets (overnight) at the largest pool (P1) on 27 February 2019; nets ~1.5 m deep, 30 m long with 12 panels of decreasing mesh size (5–55 mm).
    - Daytime visual fish surveys at P1 and channels C4–C6 between 26 Feb and 1 Mar 2019.

- Sampling sites and timeline
  - Nine water bodies sampled: six pools (P1–P6) and three channels (C1–C3), with later regular monitoring at P1 (P1 Bay and P1 Main) and C2.
  - Sampling period: late February to March 2018 initially; regular monitoring through to ~early 2019.
  - Spatial data collection: GPS location recorded with Garmin GPSMAP 62s on first visit.
  - Sea comparison: conductivity measurements taken in adjacent sea on 27 February 2018; temperature measurements from 7 March 2019 to 22 March 2019.

- Environmental measurements
  - In-water measurements on all visits (26 Feb 2018 – 25 Jan 2019): temperature (°C), dissolved oxygen (% and μg/L), conductivity (μS/cm).
  - Temperature-only measurements in 7 Mar 2019 – 22 Mar 2019 for additional data.

- Fish observations and measurements
  - Target species: Mediterranean killifish Aphanius fasciatus and Eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki.
  - Data captured per trapping event:
    - Trap type (SUBM = Submerged, SEMI = Semi-submerged), trap identifier, site code, date.
    - Species observed, sex (male noted when obvious), fork length (mm).
    - For traps: counts by species (Aphanius, Gambusia) and total count per trap.
  - Additional metadata: notes on presence/absence of fish per trap event.

- Metadata and data files
  - Data files:
    - Akrotiri_aquatic_environment_26_2_18_22_3_19: site location and environmental measurements.
    - Akrotiri_fish_26_2_18_22_3_19: all fish observations (species, sex, length, etc.).
    - Akrotiri_traps_26_2_18_22_3_19: trap-specific observations (counts per species, totals).
  - Data structure notes:
    - Date and time fields, site codes, site full names (including natural vs. refuge populations for Aphanius).
    - Geographic coordinates in degrees, minutes, seconds; environmental measurements with units specified.
    - Trap observations include trap_type, trap_number, and per-trap counts for Aphanius and Gambusia.

- Data quality and stewardship
  - Quality control: protocols and equipment developed by an experienced CEH staff member (>25 years) with initial field training provided to local staff; all data reviewed and digitised by the CEH staff member.
  - Data handling: datasets created to be discoverable and usable with metadata; aims to support downstream analysis and reporting.

- Data gaps and limitations
  - Missing data primarily due to equipment failure after 25 January 2019 (some environmental measurements missing post-failure).
  - Missing data on 28 February 2018 for P1 Main.
  - P1 Bay surveyed on 26 February 2018; considered highly similar to P1 Main due to proximity, with no significant expected differences.
