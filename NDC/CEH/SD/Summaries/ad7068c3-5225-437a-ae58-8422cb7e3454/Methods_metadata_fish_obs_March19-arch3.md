# Methods, metadata and summary for fish monitoring at Akrotiri up to 22 nd March 2019 (IJW)

- Project context: Data collection under Defra Darwin Initiative Plus Project DPLUS056 to assess and monitor current and future invasive alien species (IAS) in Cyprus and establish baseline data on native and non-native fish in the Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri.

- Organizations involved: Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH); Joint Services Health Unit; Akrotiri Environmental Education Centre; Water Development Board of Cyprus.

- Monitoring design and scope:
  - Studied 9 water bodies (6 pools: P1–P6; 3 channels: C1–C3) during late Feb–early Mar 2018.
  - Regular monitoring repeated approximately every 2 weeks at one pool (P1) and one channel (C2) through to Jan 2019; P1 Bay sampling moved to P1 Main due to falling water levels.
  - Objective: baseline information on fish populations (native Aphanius fasciatus and non-native Gambusia holbrooki) and associated environmental context.

- Field sampling methods:
  - Trapping: baited mesh traps (55 x 24 x 24 cm; 3 mm mesh) baited with halibut pellets; two configurations:
    - Submerged: placed on the water body bottom up to ~1 m depth.
    - Semi-submerged: openings span the water surface.
  - Deployment: approximately 24 hours per trap set.
  - Handling: captured fish were brought to shallow trays, identified, sexed if obvious (males), and released back alive.
  - Additional nets: two bottom-set CEN standard survey nets (~1.5 m deep, 30 m long, monofilament nylon) deployed overnight at the largest pool (P1) on 27 Feb 2019.
  - Visual surveys: daytime fish surveys at P1 and channels C4–C6 between 26 Feb and 1 Mar 2019.

- Environmental measurements and instruments:
  - Location data: GPS (Garmin GPSMAP 62s) on first visit.
  - Water quality and physics: water temperature, dissolved oxygen (% and µg/L), conductivity (μS/cm).
  - Timing: measurements taken from 26 Feb 2018 to 25 Jan 2019; conductivity measurements also taken in the adjacent sea on 27 Feb 2018 for comparison; temperature-only measurements from 7 Mar 2019 to 22 Mar 2019.
  - Equipment: YSI Pro30 Conductivity Instrument for most measurements; alternative thermometer used for temperature data later.

- Datasets and metadata:
  - Akrotiri_aquatic_environment_26_2_18_22_3_19: site locations and environmental measurements.
  - Akrotiri_fish_26_2_18_22_3_19: all fish observations from trapping sessions.
  - Akrotiri_traps_26_2_18_22_3_19: trap-specific observations (counts per trap, across Aphanius fasciatus and Gambusia holbrooki; total per trap).
  - Data columns include Date, Site_code, Site_full_name, latitude/longitude, Temp, DO (% and µg/L), Cond, Trap_Type (SUBM or SEMI), Trap_number, Species (Aphanius or Gambusia), Sex, Length, and counts for trap catches.

- Data quality and provenance:
  - Quality control by an experienced CEH staff member who developed protocols and led fieldwork; all data reviewed and digitised by CEH personnel.
  - Acknowledges missing data primarily due to equipment failures after 25 Jan 2019; additional minor gaps (e.g., 28 Feb 2018 for P1 Main) noted and contextualized.

- Key findings (species and observations):
  - Target species documented: Aphanius fasciatus (Mediterranean killifish) and Gambusia holbrooki (Eastern mosquitofish).
  - Sex and length data collected where observable; traps recorded per habitat configuration and trap number.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks and policy:
  - Provides an end-to-end data collection workflow, from site selection and environmental monitoring to species capture, measurement, and data management.
  - Demonstrates data governance through metadata heavy datasets and QA by a senior expert.
  - Highlights practical challenges relevant to monitoring frameworks: data gaps due to equipment, site movement due to hydrological changes, and need for clear data fields to enable verification and reuse.
  - Generates baseline, comparable measures of native versus non-native fish presence and habitat conditions to inform future management decisions and policy evaluation in protected or managed areas.
