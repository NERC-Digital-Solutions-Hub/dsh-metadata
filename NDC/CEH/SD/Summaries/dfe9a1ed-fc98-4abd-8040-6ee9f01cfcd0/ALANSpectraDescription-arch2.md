# Effects of artificial light on multi-trophic population dynamics

- Objective and scope
  - Assess how different narrow-band artificial light spectra at night affect a multi-trophic insect-plant community (aphids, parasitoids, hyperparasitoids) and plant biomass.
  - Combine field mesocosm experiments with controlled laboratory experiments to characterize spectral responses and mechanistic behaviors.
  - Data collected under the NERC project NE/N001672/1, spanning 2017–2018.

- Experimental design (field)
  - Setting: 47.5 cm cube Bug Dorm mesocosms arranged in a field near Exeter, UK.
  - Community: broad beans (Vicia faba) with three aphid species (Aphis fabae, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Megoura viciae); specialist parasitoid Aphidius megourae; secondary hyperparasitoids (endophagous Alloxystini and ectophagous parasitoids).
  - Light treatments: seven monochromatic spectra plus a dark control (wavelengths 385, 447, 469, 475, 518, 607, 630 nm) and a dark control; white-light reference used in lab experiments.
  - Light levels: about 7.1 μmol m^-2 s^-1 (≈ 20 lux) for all treatments; UV treatment kept at 2.4 μmol m^-2 s^-1 due to energy and safety limits.
  - Replication: originally 7 replicates per treatment; final analyses included 6 replicates for red and green, 5 replicates for UV, due to establishment criteria.
  - Procedure: lighting activated at night (70 lux) and deactivated at 110 lux; plants increased from 2 to 8 pots per mesocosm; spatial separation and barriers minimized light spillover.
  - Measurements: weekly counts of aphids and parasitoid mummies on half of the plants per cage; full checks when a species was absent; 10% mummy sampling at weeks 12 and 14 for parasite identification; week-10 dry biomass measurements after introducing 2-week-old bean plants for 3 weeks.

- Experimental design (lab)
  - Mechanistic experiments under controlled conditions (20°C, 16:8 h light:dark):
    - (i) 24-hour attack rate: one Aphidius megourae parasitoid per cage with Megoura viciae aphids; counts of mummies after 2 weeks.
    - (ii) Parasitoid flight-to-light: release of 20 mated Aphidius megourae in darkness with different light treatments above; positions of parasitoids recorded after 1 hour.
  - Light level for laboratory tests maintained at 20 lux to align with field white-light control comparisons; includes a white-light reference treatment.

- Data collection and quality control
  - Data captured in five separate files detailing population dynamics, hyperparasitism rates, plant biomass, and parasitoid behavior under different light conditions.
  - Weekly data collection across 17 weeks in the field; targeted sampling for parasitoids and hyperparasitoids on selected weeks.
  - Quality checks performed post-entry by comparing digital records to hard copies.

- Variables and data structure
  - Key fields: Week, Cage (mesocosm), Abundance.factor, Block, Treatment (control, spectra), Spectra (wavelengths), M.v (Megoura viciae), A.p (Acyrthosiphon pisum), A.f (Aphis fabae), various mummy and hyperparasitoid counts (e.g., L.f, A.e, A.m, D.c, D.d, A.s, A.v).
  - Plant measures: aboveground and belowground dry biomass.
  - Behavioral and spatial data: parasitoid presence on plant, cage side, or near light.
  - Additional notes: Winged morph counts for aphids and parasitoids; hyperparasitism presence/absence.

- Outputs and potential uses for environmental monitoring
  - Enables time-resolved, multi-trophic assessment of environmental drivers (artificial light spectra) on insect-plant networks.
  - Provides standardized datasets suitable for integration with other monitoring data and for evaluating policy-relevant questions about light pollution effects.
  - Data can be used to map spectral sensitivity of ecological interactions and to compare field outcomes with controlled-condition mechanisms.
