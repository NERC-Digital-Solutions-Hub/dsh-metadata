# Managed realignment at Tollesbury

- Experimental Design/Sampling Regime
  - Location and timing: Tollesbury Managed Realignment site (TL 960 110); breach of the sea wall occurred on 4 August 1995.
  - Transects: twenty 2-m-wide transects randomly located within the site to measure bed level changes; measurements along each transect taken from fixed positions relative to an aluminium bar; readings to the nearest millimetre.
  - Time series: measurements collected monthly from September 1995 to 1998, bi-monthly up to 2000, then in April and September to 2007.
  - Elevation range: transect elevations ranged from 1.22 m to 1.71 m ODN, mean 1.36 m ODN.
  - Additional transects: in April 1999, five more sediment transects (21–25) added inside the site (not covered by the original 20); data from these were collected in April and September to 2007.
  - Data coverage notes: transects 21–25 had no data before April 1999.

- Data Collection and Fieldwork Instrumentation
  - Setup: wooden posts at sample positions; an aluminium rod placed across the posts; a ruler used to measure perpendicular distance from the aluminium rod to the surface.
  - Recording: measurements recorded in a notebook and entered into an Excel spreadsheet.

- Nature and Units of Recorded Values
  - All readings recorded to the millimetre.

- Details of Data Structure
  - Data columns: Date; Transect columns 1 to 25.
  - Data gaps: no data for transects 21–25 before April 1999.
  - Missing values: two missing values on 01/10/2007 for transects 7 and 9 (wooden posts could not be located).

- Miscellaneous
  - Context: Part of Defra’s Flood and Coastal Defence research programme; a full-scale experiment constructing low embankments behind an existing sea wall to surround about 21 hectares of land.
  - Objectives: initial vegetation and hydrology studies; as area changed from terrestrial to intertidal, anticipated shifts in invertebrate fauna and saltmarsh vegetation.
  - Roles and timeline: multi-disciplinary collaboration; responsibilities distributed among ITE (overall coordination), Silsoe Research Institute (soil monitoring), HR Wallingford Ltd (hydrology), and later CEH (overall project management and monitoring coordination); Queen Mary and Westfield College contributed to invertebrate/plant research; extended monitoring periods authorized in 1997 and 2003 with CEH and Rothamsted Research (formerly Silsoe) involved in respective monitoring tasks.
  - Outputs: results reported to Defra (Reading et al., 2002; 2008 project report).
