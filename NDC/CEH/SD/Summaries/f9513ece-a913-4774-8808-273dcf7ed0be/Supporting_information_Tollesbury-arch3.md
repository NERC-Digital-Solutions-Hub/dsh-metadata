# Managed realignment at Tollesbury

## Overview and aims
- Large-scale, Defra-funded study of managed realignment of sea defences at Tollesbury, Essex, initiated in 1995.
- Goals included understanding sediment accretion, vegetation colonisation (saltmarsh), and changes in invertebrate communities as terrestrial habitat becomes intertidal.
- Aimed to inform policy and practice on coastal defence realignment by monitoring physical, chemical, and ecological responses over time.
- Project coordinated across multiple organisations (ITE, Silsoe/Rothamsted, HR Wallingford, QM Westfield College) with CEH taking overarching responsibility for extended monitoring from 2003–2008.

## Experimental design and data collection
- Initial sampling: twenty 2-m-wide transects (total) established before breach of the sea wall in August 1995 to measure bed-level changes.
- Transect setup and measurement:
  - Wooden posts at sample positions; an aluminium rod across posts; perpendicular distance to the surface measured with a ruler.
  - Readings recorded to the nearest millimetre.
  - Data collected monthly (Sept 1995–1998), then bimonthly (to 2000), and from 2000 onward at two annual time points (April and September) to 2007.
- Additional transects:
  - In April 1999, five extra sediment transects (21–25) added inside the site in suspected eroding areas; data collected in April and September up to 2007.
- Study area and expected outcomes:
  - The breach exposed about 21 hectares of agricultural land to tidal inundation, anticipated to drive sediment deposition and ecological succession toward saltmarsh vegetation and associated invertebrates.
- Fieldwork scope and multi-disciplinary focus:
  - Vegetation and hydrology monitored by ITE; soil structure by Silsoe; hydrology and breach dynamics by HR Wallingford; invertebrate studies added later by QM Westfield College.

## Data structure, units, and timing
- Recorded values: millimetres (mm).
- Data structure:
  - Date of measurements; transect columns numbered 1–25.
  - Note: Transects 21–25 had no data prior to April 1999.
- Data completeness:
  - Two missing values on 01/10/2007 for transects 7 and 9 due to inability to locate wooden posts.
- Data handling:
  - Data collected in notebooks and entered into Excel spreadsheets; clear documentation of transect positions and collection dates.

## Governance, responsibilities, and reporting
- 1995–1997: Multi-agency involvement (ITE for biology, Silsoe for soils, HR Wallingford for hydrology); coordination of local field activities.
- 1997 onward: Defra extended the research program for five years and approved additional work on invertebrates; overall coordination assigned to ITE.
- 2003–2008 extension: CEH given overall responsibility for the extended project; CEH monitored sediment accretion annually; botanical monitoring in years 1, 3, and 5; invertebrate monitoring in years 2 and 5; Silsoe (Rothamsted) subcontracted to conduct soil monitoring (years 1 and 5).
- Outputs:
  - Key results communicated in Reading et al. (2002) Defra project report.
  - Final extended monitoring and reporting documented in the 2008 Defra/CEH publication (Reading et al., 2008).

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a long-term, multi-institutional monitoring framework spanning physical, chemical, and ecological components.
- Provides a model of:
  - Clear experimental design (pre-breach baseline, repeated measures, expansion with additional transects).
  - Robust data management practices (explicit data structure, mm-scale resolution, transparent handling of missing data).
  - Explicit governance and role allocation across organisations to sustain monitoring and reporting.
  - Integration of policy-relevant outcomes (sediment dynamics, habitat transformation, and biotic colonisation) to inform coastal defence decision-making.
