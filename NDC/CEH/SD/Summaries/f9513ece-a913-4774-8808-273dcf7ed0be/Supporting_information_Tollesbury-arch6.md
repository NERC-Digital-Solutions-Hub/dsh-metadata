# Experimental Design/Sampling Regime

- Study area and timing: Tollesbury Managed Realignment site (TL 960 110); pre-breach measurements began before the sea wall breaching on 4 August 1995.
- Primary data collection: twenty transects, each 2 metres wide, randomly located within the site to monitor bed level changes.
- Measurement protocol: for each transect, twenty measurements were taken at fixed positions relative to an aluminium bar spanning the ends of the transect; readings recorded to the nearest millimetre.
- Temporal sampling regime:
  - Monthly measurements from September 1995 to 1998
  - Bimonthly up to 2000
  - April and September measurements through 2007
- Elevation range: transect elevations between 1.22 m and 1.71 m ODN, mean 1.36 m ODN.
- Additional transects: in April 1999, five extra sediment transects (21–25) were added inside the site (not covering the original 20 transects); data collected in April and September up to 2007.

## Data Collection and fieldwork

- Physical setup: wooden posts placed at sample positions; an aluminium rod placed across the posts; ruler to measure perpendicular distance from the aluminium rod to the surface of the saltmarsh.
- Recording method: measurements noted in a notebook and later entered into an Excel spreadsheet.

## Nature and Units of Recorded Values

- All measurements are recorded in millimetres.

## Details of data structure

- Data columns:
  - Date of measurements
  - Columns 1–25 correspond to transect numbers (1–20 from original grid; 21–25 added in 1999)
- Gaps:
  - No data for transects 21–25 before April 1999
  - Two missing values on 01/10/2007 for transects 7 and 9 because wooden posts could not be located

## Miscellaneous

- Context: Part of Defra’s Flood and Coastal Defence research programme; a full-scale experiment involving new low embankments behind the existing sea wall and about 21 hectares of agricultural land exposed to tidal inundation.
- Multidisciplinary scope: vegetation/hydrology studies initially; subsequent focused studies on soil structure and invertebrates in saltmarsh establishment.
- Project timeline and responsibilities:
  - 1995–2002: ITE led the multidisciplinary research; others contributed (ITE for realignment monitoring, Silsoe Research Institute for soil studies, HR Wallingford for hydrology)
  - 1997 and 2002: Defra approvals for continued five-year research and expanded aims
  - 2003–2008: CEH took overall project responsibility; annual sediment accretion monitoring; botanical and invertebrate assessments at specified years; Silsoe (Rothamsted) subcontracted for soil monitoring (years 1 and 5)
