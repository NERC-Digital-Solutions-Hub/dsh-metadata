# Managed realignment at Tollesbury

- Purpose and scope
  - Defra-funded full-scale experiment to study managed realignment at Tollesbury, Essex.
  - Breach of the sea wall occurred on 4 August 1995, exposing about 21 hectares of agricultural land to tidal inundation.
  - Aimed to observe sediment accretion, saltmarsh vegetation establishment, and intertidal invertebrate faunas as habitat shifts from terrestrial to intertidal/marsh areas occurred.
  - governance and monitoring extended through multiple phases (1995–2008).

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Before breach: twenty 2-m-wide transects randomly located to measure bed level changes.
  - Measurements: monthly along Sep 1995–1998, bimonthly to 2000, then April and September to 2007.
  - Elevation range of transects: 1.22–1.71 m OD(N) with mean 1.36 m OD(N).
  - In April 1999: five additional sediment transects (21–25) added in areas thought to be eroding; data collected April and September to 2007.

- Data collection and instrumentation
  - Wooden posts at sample positions; an aluminium rod spanning the posts; a ruler to measure perpendicular distance to the surface.
  - Readings recorded in a notebook and later entered into an Excel spreadsheet.

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Readings recorded to the nearest millimetre.

- Data structure and metadata
  - Data columns: Date; Transects 1–25.
  - Note: No data for transects 21–25 before April 1999.
  - Missing data: two gaps on 01/10/2007 for transects 7 and 9 (posts could not be located).

- Site context and multidisciplinary responsibilities
  - Defra project involved collaboration among multiple organizations:
    - Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE): overall coordination; vegetation and hydrology monitoring.
    - Silsoe Research Institute (now Rothamsted Research): soil structure studies.
    - HR Wallingford Ltd: hydrology studies of breach and adjacent creeks.
    - Queen Mary and Westfield College (Department of Biological Sciences): role in invertebrates and saltmarsh plant studies (1997 onward).
  - Extended monitoring periods:
    - 1997 onward: five-year multidisciplinary extension approved.
    - 2003–2008: further five-year monitoring approved with reduced intensity.
      - CEH: overall responsibility for extended project; monitoring of sediment accretion (annually), botany (years 1,3,5), and invertebrates (years 2 and 5).
      - Silsoe/Rothamsted: subcontracted for soil monitoring (years 1 and 5).

- Outputs, data use, and reporting
  - Data intended for consistent environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessment over time.
  - Outputs include documented sediment accretion, vegetation establishment, and invertebrate colonization as indicators of ecosystem change post-realignment.
