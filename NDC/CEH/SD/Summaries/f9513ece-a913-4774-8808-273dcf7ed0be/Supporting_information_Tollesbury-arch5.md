# Experimental Design/Sampling Regime

- Study context and objective
  - Tollesbury Managed Realignment site (TL 960 110) under Defra Flood and Coastal Defence programme.
  - Breaching the sea wall occurred on 4 August 1995 to expose ~21 hectares to tidal inundation.
  - Aimed to monitor habitat changes as land transitioned from terrestrial to intertidal saltmarsh, including vegetation, hydrology, soil structure, and invertebrate dynamics.

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Initially twenty 2-m-wide transects randomly located within the site to measure bed-level changes.
  - Data collection spanned: monthly (Sept 1995–1998), bi-monthly (to 2000), then Apr and Sept to 2007.
  - In April 1999, five additional sediment transects (21–25) were added in areas thought to be eroding; transects 21–25 were not part of the original 20 transects.
  - Elevation measurements referenced to Ordnance Datum Newlyn (ODN).

- Data collection methods and instrumentation
  - Field setup: wooden posts at sample positions; an aluminium rod across posts; ruler used to measure perpendicular distance to surface.
  - Recording: measurements logged in a notebook and later entered into an Excel spreadsheet.
  - Measurements recorded to the nearest millimetre.

- Data recorded and structure
  - Columns: Date; Transect numbers 1–25 (transcends the 20 original transects plus 21–25 added later).
  - Data period coverage: transects 1–20 from 1995 onward; transects 21–25 data begin in Apr 1999.
  - Data units: millimetres for all readings.
  - Elevation range across transects: 1.22 m to 1.71 m ODN; mean ~1.36 m ODN.
  - Data notes: two missing values for the last measurement (01/10/2007) for transects 7 and 9 due to posts not being located.

- Data provenance and project governance
  - Multi-disciplinary, multi-institution collaboration:
    - ITE (Institute of Terrestrial Ecology) – overall project coordination and biological monitoring.
    - Silsoe Research Institute (now Rothamsted Research) – soil structure studies.
    - HR Wallingford Ltd – hydrology studies of breach and creeks.
    - QMUL (Queen Mary and Westfield College) – invertebrate and saltmarsh plant studies (5-year extension).
  - Extended/ongoing monitoring:
    - 1997–2002: five-year multidisciplinary program; results reported in 2002.
    - 2003–2008: extended monitoring (reduced scope); CEH (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology) responsible for overall management; annual sediment accretion monitoring; botanical and invertebrate monitoring in specified years; Silsoe/Rothamsted subcontracted for soil monitoring.
  - Documentation and references:
    - Final project report: Reading et al., 2008 (CEH Project Report C00356; R&D Technical Report FD 1922/TR).
    - Key reporting: 2002 progress/summary by Reading et al.

- Data quality, gaps, and limitations
  - Measurements are primary data recorded under field conditions with potential for transcription errors during notebook-to-spreadsheet entry.
  - Notable gaps and issues:
    - No data for transects 21–25 before Apr 1999.
    - Data loss for the last measurement date (01/10/2007) for transects 7 and 9 due to missing posts.
  - Implications for data reuse:
    - Clear metadata needed for transect history, date ranges, and instrument calibration.
    - Documentation of changes in transect coverage over time and notes on missing data are essential for longitudinal analyses.

- Implications for data stewardship
  - Ensure comprehensive metadata including: measurement protocol, instruments, date format, units (mm), transect definitions (1–25), and change history (addition of transects 21–25 in 1999).
  - Preserve original field notebooks or scans alongside the Excel dataset to support provenance.
  - Maintain data lineage: link dataset to the Defra project context and CEH/I TE/HRW/QMUL/Silsoe/Rothamsted roles.
  - Provide a data dictionary and clear handling rules for missing data and transect transitions (1–20 vs 21–25).
  - Consider long-term storage in interoperable formats (e.g., CSV) with explicit date and numeric schemas, enabling easier cross-walk with other related datasets from the Tollesbury project.
