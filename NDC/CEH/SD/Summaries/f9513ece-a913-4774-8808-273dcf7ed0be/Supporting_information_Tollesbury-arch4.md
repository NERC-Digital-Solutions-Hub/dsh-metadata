# Managed realignment at Tollesbury

## Overview
- Study of managed realignment at Tollesbury, Essex, following the breach of the sea wall on 4 August 1995 to convert agricultural land behind the wall into intertidal habitat.
- Area involved: approximately 21 hectares of low-lying land adjacent to Tollesbury Creek.
- Goals: monitor sediment accretion, saltmarsh vegetation establishment, and invertebrate communities as the habitat shifts from terrestrial to intertidal.
- Multidisciplinary project involving ITE (biology), Silsoe/Rothamsted (soil), HR Wallingford (hydrology), and coordination by CEH/Defra with extended monitoring through 2008.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Before breaching, 20 transects (2 m wide) were randomly located to measure bed-level changes.
- Measurements taken at fixed positions along each transect relative to an aluminium bar; readings to the nearest millimetre.
- Data collection frequency: monthly from Sep 1995 to 1998; bimonthly up to 2000; then Apr and Sep through 2007.
- Elevation readings ranged from 1.22 m to 1.71 m Ordnance Datum Newlyn (ODN), with a mean of 1.36 m ODN.
- In Apr 1999, five additional sediment transects (transects 21–25) were added inside the site (not covered by the original 20).

## Data collection, fieldwork and instrumentation
- Field setup used wooden posts at sample positions with an aluminium rod across them.
- Perpendicular distance from the aluminium rod to the surface measured with a ruler.
- Readings recorded in a notebook and entered into an Excel spreadsheet.

## Data structure, content and units
- Core data columns: Date; Transect numbers 1–25.
- Note: No data were collected for transects 21–25 before Apr 1999.
- Missing data: two missing values on 01/10/2007 for transects 7 and 9 due to posts not located.
- Units: measurements recorded in millimetres; elevations originally referenced in metres (ODN).

## Context, governance and timeline
- Defra Flood and Coastal Defence programme funded the project.
- Project progression: initial 1995–1998 data collection with ongoing monitoring; 1997 authorization for an additional five years; 2003 authorization for a further five years (2003–2008) with reduced monitoring.
- Roles and responsibilities:
  - CEH: overall responsibility for the extended project and monitoring program.
  - ITE: coordination of multidisciplinary research and biological monitoring.
  - Silsoe Research Institute (Rothamsted Research): soil monitoring.
  - HR Wallingford Ltd: hydrology studies.
  - Queen Mary and Westfield College, Department of Biological Sciences: role in invertebrate studies.
- The subsequent program continued monitoring annually for sediment accretion and periodic botanical and invertebrate assessments (years 1, 3, and 5 for flora; years 2 and 5 for invertebrates).
