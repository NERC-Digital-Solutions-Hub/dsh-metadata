# Experimental Design/Sampling Regime

## Site and purpose
- Tollesbury Managed Realignment site (grid reference TL 960 110) involved breaching the sea wall in August 1995 to study sedimentation, saltmarsh establishment, and ecological changes after realignment.
- The site encompasses approximately 21 hectares of previously agricultural land now exposed to tidal inundation; the realignment aimed to observe silt accumulation and habitat development (vegetation, hydrology, invertebrates).

## Sampling design and transects
- Primary transects: twenty 2-m-wide transects randomly located within the site to monitor bed-level changes.
- Additional transects: five more transects (transects 21–25) added in April 1999 inside the site, near high ground, breach vicinity, and areas thought to erode.
- Transects 1–20 were established before the breach; transects 21–25 were added later and data for them begin in April 1999.
- Measurements along each transect were taken at fixed positions relative to an aluminium bar spanning permanent end points.

## Data collection and field methods
- Instrumentation: wooden posts mark sample positions; an aluminium rod across the posts; a ruler to measure perpendicular distance to the surface.
- Recording process: measurements recorded in a notebook and entered into an Excel spreadsheet.
- Precision: readings recorded to the nearest millimetre (mm).

## Data structure and content
- Data columns: Date and transect numbers (Columns 1–25 correspond to transects 1–25).
- Data availability: No data for transects 21–25 before April 1999.
- Missing data: two missing values on 01/10/2007 for transects 7 and 9 due to inability to locate wooden posts.
- Elevation context: readings reflect bed-level changes with elevations ranging from 1.22 m to 1.71 m ODN (mean 1.36 m ODN).

## Temporal coverage and sampling schedule
- Sampling cadence: monthly (Sept 1995–1998), bi-monthly (1999–2000), then April and September until 2007.
- Overall timespan: 1995 through 2007 for bed-level measurements.

## Context and multi-disciplinary monitoring
- Integrated research program funded under Defra’s Flood and Coastal Defence research programme.
- Collaboration across disciplines:
  - Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE): overall coordination and biological monitoring (realignment site and adjacent marshes).
  - Silsoe Research Institute (now Rothamsted Research): soil structure monitoring within flooded area.
  - HR Wallingford Ltd.: hydrology of breach and adjacent creeks.
  - Queen Mary and Westfield College, Department of Biological Sciences: invertebrate role in saltmarsh plant establishment.
- Project timeline:
  - 1995: Breach and initiation of multidisciplinary monitoring.
  - 1997–2002: Initial five-year multidisciplinary research period (defining roles and outputs).
  - 2003–2008: Continued monitoring (reduced scope); CEH responsible for overall extended project management; soil monitoring subcontracted to Silsoe/Rothamsted; annual sediment accretion monitoring; botany and invertebrate monitoring at specified years.
