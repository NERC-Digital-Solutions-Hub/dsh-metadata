# Atmospheric inputs

## Sampling design and collection
- Samples collected weekly to fortnightly to capture high variability in throughfall and stemflow volumes and chemistry.
- Rainfall: collected with a polypropylene funnel on towers above the canopy; stored in 1 L polythene bottles; returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
- Throughfall: collected using roving collectors randomly distributed within a block (Black Wood) or along a transect (Old Pond Close).
- Stemflow: collected with a plastic silicone rubber collar tubing around the tree, runoff captured in a large bin.
- Simultaneous collection of throughfall and stemflow using a runoff sheet collector attached to a series of trees.

## Streams
- At Old Pond Close, one stream sampled by grab sampling using a polythene bucket attached to nylon cord.

## Filtration and storage
- Samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing; both unfiltered and filtered samples required for chemical analysis.
- Unfiltered samples used for pH and alkalinity determination.
  - Streams: kept in filled glass bottles to minimize CO2 degassing that can affect pH readings.
  - Rainfall: degassing would occur if samples were left standing in the field.
- Filtration: 0.45 μm Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (47 mm) under vacuum.
- Processing:
  - Unfiltered samples analyzed on the same day for pH and alkalinity.
  - Filtered samples stored prior to cation analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
  - For anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium), stored without acidification.
- Storage and containers:
  - Polypropylene bottles cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and rinsed with distilled water.
  - Stored at 4°C in the dark.
