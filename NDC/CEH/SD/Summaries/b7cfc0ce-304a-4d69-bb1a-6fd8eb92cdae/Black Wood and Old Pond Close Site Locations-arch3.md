# Interception of chemicals at a forest edge for a rural low-lying site at Black Wood, Hampshire, Southern England.

## Overview
- Document presents plot-level data entries for forested sites, including Black Wood (Hampshire) and Old Pond Close (Northamptonshire), with start and end dates, grid references, and notes.
- Cited studies focus on interception of atmospheric pollutants by forests and attenuation at forested sites (Neal et al. 1994; Neal 2002).

## Data scope and sources
- Black Wood, Hampshire: Start 23 May 1990 to End 12 December 1991; grid reference SU534428; notes reference Neal et al. 2004.
- Old Pond Close, Northamptonshire: Start 20 March 1991 to End 6 April 1992; grid reference SP877551; notes reference Neal, 2002.
- Authors linked to cited works include Neal, Ryland, Conway, Jeffery, Robson, Smith, Walls, Bhardwaj, among others.
- References cited: Interception of chemicals at a forest edge (Neal et al., 1994) and Interception and attenuation of atmospheric pollution in a lowland ash forested site (Neal, 2002).

## Data quality and metadata
- Many fields are incomplete or missing (represented by dots and blank entries), including several start/end date components and grid references.
- Notes point to external publications for plot locations and methodologies, indicating reliance on secondary sources for metadata.
- The presence of placeholder fields highlights gaps in metadata, data provenance, and documentation.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a monitoring approach centered on interception/attenuation of atmospheric pollutants in forested environments.
- Illustrates the need for robust metadata, data provenance, and traceability to source studies.
- Highlights data governance considerations: data quality assurance, open sharing of underlying data, and ensuring data are up-to-date.
- Reflects common framework challenges: data availability, access barriers, organizational silos, data transformation needs, and clear communication of complex findings.

## Relevance to the archetype (Authors of Monitoring Frameworks)
- Provides a concrete example of identifying environmental health measures (pollutant interception in forests) and linking them to policy-relevant outputs.
- Shows how monitoring datasets are assembled from multiple sites, require careful metadata management, and depend on cross-referencing scientific literature.
- Underlines the importance of data sharing, standards, and governance to enable transparent, actionable monitoring outputs.
