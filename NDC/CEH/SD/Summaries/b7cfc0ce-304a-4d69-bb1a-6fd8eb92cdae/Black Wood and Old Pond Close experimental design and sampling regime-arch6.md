# Black Wood, Hampshire

- This document describes hydrological monitoring and data collection at two forest sites, focusing on interception, throughfall, stemflow, net precipitation, and related water chemistry to understand how woodland affects water movement and quality.

## Overview of Data Scope

- Primary aim: quantify interception and hydrological fluxes around forest edges and within plantation stands to support understanding of water balance and element transport.
- Sites:
  - Black Wood (2.4 km2) in rural southern England, beech plantation on limed agricultural land.
  - Old Pond Close woodland (25 ha) near Yardley Chase, largely mixed with common ash and understory vegetation.
- Data types include meteorological measurements, hydrological fluxes (precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, net precipitation, runoff), and, for Black Wood, water chemistry analyses.

## Data Collected and Variables

- Black Wood
  - Precipitation above canopy (two towers with funnel gauges).
  - Throughfall (10–15 cm diameter roving gauges; randomly relocated; understory included).
  - Net precipitation over a 90 m2 plastic-sheet collector enclosing four stems.
  - Stemflow volumes (collected in bins).
  - Runoff from a small drainage area.
  - Soil moisture and microclimate data via neutron access tubes, tensiometers, and automatic weather stations.
  - Weighed volumes to derive total precipitation and throughfall; net precipitation derived from collector data.
  - Optional chemical analyses on combined samples (pH, major/minor/trace elements by ICP, potassium by AAS, major anions/fluorine by IC, ammonium and silicon by colorimetry); alkalinity calculated via a pH-based equation.
- Old Pond Close
  - Precipitation (two canopy funnel collectors above the trees).
  - Throughfall (10 roving gauges randomly located along a 100 m transect; relocated at sampling times).
  - Net precipitation (plastic-sheet collector over 90 m2, enclosing four stems).
  - Runoff (ephemeral stream; spot samples).
  - Chemical analyses of combined precipitation and throughfall samples (pH, ICP, AAS, IC, colorimetry); alkalinity calculated as for Black Wood.

## Study Design and Sampling

- Black Wood
  - Edge-focused interception gradient with plots positioned at 20, 50, 100, 200, and 350 m from the forest edge.
  - Each distance: a row of three plots; each plot ~100 m2 with four trees.
  - Within each plot: eight throughfall samplers and four stemflow collectors.
  - Adjacent central plot included on row 4 for method comparison.
  - Sampling frequency typically every 1–2 weeks; gauges relocated after each collection to reduce bias.
  - Relocation and plot configuration chosen due to practical constraints (large edge trees and a forest road near the edge).
- Old Pond Close
  - Fortnightly sampling from March 1991 for about one year.
  - 100 m transect for throughfall sampling; roving gauges relocated over time to capture variability.
  - Canopy rainfall measured with two towers; net precipitation collected over a 90 m2 area; runoff sampled from a small stream.

## Measurements, Equipment, and Procedures

- Throughfall and rainfall measurement
  - Throughfall gauges: circular gauges with 7.6 cm radius; funnel rims ~50 cm above ground; small-mesh filters to prevent debris.
  - Rainfall above canopy: two towers, rainfall funnels, 7 mm tubing, bottles at base; wetting error < 0.2 mm.
  - Net precipitation: plastic sheet collector (90 m2) above understory; tipping-bucket sampling; collates rainfall and throughfall over a larger area to reduce array bias.
- Stemflow
  - Collected in 450 L bins; trunk collars placed to capture stemflow.
- Runoff and river chemistry
  - Runoff collected from a small stream; samples stored in cleaned 2 L bottles.
- Sample processing and analysis
  - Precipitation and throughfall samples filtered immediately (0.45 μm) prior to lab analysis.
  - Chemical analyses include electrometric pH, ICP emission spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy (potassium), ion chromatography (major anions and fluorine), and colorimetry (ammonium, silicon).
  - Alkalinity estimated using a derived equation from pH, serving as a proxy for buffering and weathering processes.

## Data Processing and Quality Considerations

- Volume calculations achieved by weighing collected fluids; volumes from combined replicates aggregated for analysis.
- For throughfall, roving gauges were relocated to minimize bias and to capture spatial variability.
- Data interpretation acknowledges heterogeneity of interception and potential evaporation effects not captured by net precipitation measurements (especially for understory evaporation).
- Observational constraints near the edge affected plot placement and may influence edge-gradient assessments.

## Data Uses and Products

- Supports modelling of interception losses as a fraction of precipitation (e.g., intercepts up to ~11% for Old Pond Close reported).
- Enables comparison of edge effects vs. interior canopy interception across plots and time.
- Provides a chemically characterized dataset to examine how interception and canopy processes influence water quality inputs to soils and streams.
- Produces time-series data for precipitation fluxes, throughfall, stemflow, net precipitation, and runoff, useful for hydrological and environmental impact analyses.

## References and Context

- Sampling and analysis methods build upon established interception studies and prior work (e.g., Neal et al. on interception at forest edges, Calder and Rosier on net precipitation collection, and related hydrological studies cited in the document).
