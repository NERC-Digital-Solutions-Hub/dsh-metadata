# Atmospheric inputs and Filtration and storage

- Sampling frequency and scope
  - Samples collected weekly to fortnightly to capture high variability in throughfall and stemflow volumes and chemistry.
  - Rainfall, throughfall, stemflow, and a stream sample were collected to build a representative dataset.
- Atmospheric inputs collection methods
  - Rainfall: polypropylene funnel on towers above the canopy; field storage in 1 L polythene bottles; samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories.
  - Throughfall: roving collectors randomly distributed within a block (Black Wood) or along a transect (Old Pond Close).
  - Stemflow: plastic silicone rubber collar tubing around the tree; runoff collected in a large bin.
  - Throughfall and stemflow: simultaneous collection using a sheet collector attached to trees.
- Stream sampling
  - Old Pond Close stream sampled by grab using a polythene bucket attached to a nylon chord.
- Filtration and storage workflow
  - All samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing; both unfiltered and filtered samples required for chemical analysis.
- Unfiltered samples and initial analyses
  - Unfiltered samples used for pH and alkalinity determination.
  - For streams, samples kept in filled glass bottles to minimize CO2 degassing and pH changes; rainfall samples degassing in the field while standing.
- Filtration process
  - Filtration performed with 0.45 µm Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (47 mm) under vacuum using a Millipore holder.
- Post-filter handling and storage
  - Unfiltered samples analyzed on the same day for pH and alkalinity.
  - Filtered samples stored prior to cation analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
  - Anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium) stored without acidification.
- Storage materials and conditions
  - Polypropylene bottles cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and rinsed with distilled water.
  - Storage at 4 °C in the dark.
- Data quality and analysis implications
  - Separate handling for pH/alkalinity (unfiltered) versus cation analysis (acidified filtrate) and anions/nutrients (non-acidified filtrates) to ensure accurate chemical measurements.
  - Field degassing considerations important for interpreting pH readings, particularly in rainfall versus stream samples.
