# Atmospheric inputs

## Overview
- Weekly to fortnightly sampling cadence to capture high variability in throughfall and stemflow volumes and chemistry.
- Multiple sampling methods to obtain representative values: rainfall, throughfall, stemflow, and concurrent sheet collection across trees.
- Field sites mentioned: Black Wood (block) and Old Pond Close (transect).
- Samples processed at Wallingford Laboratories; both unfiltered and filtered portions required for chemical analysis.

## Sampling design and methods
- Rainfall
  - Collected with a polypropylene funnel mounted on towers above the tree canopy.
  - Samples stored in 1 L polythene bottles in the field.
  - Returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
- Throughfall
  - Collected using roving collectors randomly distributed within a block (Black Wood) or along a transect (Old Pond Close).
- Stemflow
  - Collected with a silicone rubber collar wrapped around the tree; runoff gathered in a large bin.
- Simultaneous sampling
  - Throughfall and stemflow also collected via sheet collectors attached to trees to capture concurrent runoff.
- Streams (Old Pond Close)
  - One stream sampled by grab sampling using a polythene bucket attached to a nylon cord.

## Filtration and storage (2.0)
- All samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
- Both unfiltered and filtered samples required for chemical analysis.

### Unfiltered samples (2.1)
- Used for pH and alkalinity determinations.
- Streams: samples kept in filled glass bottles to minimise CO2 degassing effects on pH readings.
- Rainfall: degassing expected in-field as samples stood.

### Filtration and preparation (2.2)
- Filtration: 0.45 µm Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (47 mm) under vacuum using a Millipore filter holder.
- Processing:
  - Unfiltered samples analyzed the same day for pH and alkalinity.
  - Filtered samples stored prior to cation analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
  - Anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium) stored without acidification.
- Storage vessels and conditions:
  - Polypropylene bottles, cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid, rinsed with distilled water.
  - Stored at 4°C in the dark.

## Data handling and quality considerations (GIS relevance)
- Importance of precise spatial tagging for all sampling points (rainfall towers, throughfall/stemflow tree locations, roving collector positions, stream site) to enable map-based visualization of inputs.
- Consistent data standards and metadata needed for integration across rainfall, throughfall, stemflow, and stream datasets.
- Data quality factors to consider in GIS:
  - Variability in sampling methods and placement (fixed towers vs roving collectors) requiring careful provenance tracking.
  - Sample handling effects (degassing, field storage) that may influence pH/alkalinity data.
  - Laboratory processing steps (filtration, acidification) affecting dataset harmonization across chemical analyses.
- Potential GIS outputs:
  - Spatial maps of input fluxes (rainfall, throughfall, stemflow) and chemical parameters (pH, alkalinity, nutrient concentrations).
  - Layered datasets showing correlations between canopy-derived inputs and stream chemistry.
  - Temporal series aligned with sampling frequency for trend analysis.

## End notes
- The document outlines a comprehensive approach to collecting and preparing atmospheric and aquatic inputs for chemical analysis, with explicit field and lab procedures to ensure data quality for subsequent GIS-enabled analyses and map-based data products.
