# Black Wood, Hampshire

## Overview
- A 2.4 km2 beech plantation near Micheldever, southern England, studied for interception and hydrological processes.
- Located between Winchester and Basingstoke; flat, west-dominated winds; Cretaceous Chalk bedrock with well-drained shallow soils.
- Monitoring began in spring 1989 to assess interception gradients from the forest edge using a edge-focused, block sampling design.

## Study areas
- Black Wood, Hampshire
  - Beech plantation (Fagus sylvatica) planted ~2040 years ago on limed agricultural land.
  - Soils: shallow, organic-rich; annual rainfall ~800 mm; altitude 100–150 m a.s.l.
  - Objective: quantify interception and throughfall at varying distances from the forest edge.
- Old Pond Close (Yardley Chase area)
  - 25 ha woodland at the eastern end of Yardley Chase, ~7 km NW of Olney (Buckinghamshire/Northamptonshire border).
  - Dominant vegetation: common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) planted in 1934; ~16 m tall; dense understory.
  - Soils: calcareous, dark grey-brown clay loam over Oxford Clay; long-term precipitation ~589 mm (1970–1986).
  - Objective: model interception losses for ash canopies and understory; assess water balance components including transpiration (350–370 mm) and potential summer water stress.

## Monitoring design and data collection (Black Wood)
- Instrumentation and methods
  - Neutron access tubes and tensiometers for soil moisture; automatic weather stations above canopy.
  - Rainfall measurement using canopy-top gauges; plastic sheet net rainfall gauges; stemflow and throughfall collectors; canopy rainfall towers at two sites (neighbouring ash and beech).
  - Anomalous edge effects guided edge-focused sampling.
- Plot and sampling design
  - Edge-interception gradients studied with a block sampling design.
  - Throughfall collectors placed at distances from the forest edge: ~20, 50, 100, 200, and 350 m.
  - Each distance had a row of three plots; each plot ~100 m2 bounding four trees; plots within a row separated by ~60 m.
  - Within each plot: eight throughfall samplers and four stemflow collectors; polypropylene trunk collars with stemflow collected in 450 L bins.
  - Additional adjacent plot near row 4 for comparison with near-edge plastic sheet gauge.
- Data collection and handling
  - Monitoring frequency typically every 1–2 weeks, driven by storm intensity.
  - After each collection, throughfall gauges were relocated within plots to reduce bias; stemflow volumes measured from bin volumes.
  - Throughfall and rainfall volumes determined by weighing.

## Monitoring and sampling (Old Pond Close)
- Sampling period
  - March 1991 for just over 1 year; fortnightly sampling.
- Measurements and approaches
  - Precipitation: two 14.8 cm funnels above the canopy on a tower; samples combined for chemical analysis.
  - Throughfall: 10 roving gauges (15.2 cm) along a 100 m transect; gauges relocated at sampling times to capture spatial variability; samples combined for chemical analysis.
  - Net precipitation: plastic sheet collector over 90 m2 enclosing four stems; large-volume sampling with a tipping bucket to obtain volume-integrated samples; understory evaporation not directly measured.
  - Runoff: small stream drainage sampled with clean 2 L bottles; bottles cleaned with acid and rinsed; samples weighed to determine volumes.
- Sample processing and chemical analysis
  - Combined precipitation and throughfall samples; filtration through 0.45 µm membranes on sampling day.
  - Analyses included: pH (electrometric), ICP emission spectroscopy, atomic absorption (K), ion chromatography (major anions and fluoride), colorimetry (ammonium and silicon).
  - Alkalinity estimated using the equation: Alkalinity = 6x10^(pH-6) - 10^(6-pH); assumes equilibrium with atmospheric CO2.
- Data handling
  - Replicates combined; volumes weighed and used to calculate totals; samples filtered prior to analysis.

## Key data components and variables
- Precipitation (above canopy) and net precipitation (throughfall plus stemflow) measurements.
- Throughfall and stemflow at multiple edge-adjacent distances.
- Runoff from an ephemeral stream draining the plantation.
- Chemical analyses: major, minor, and trace elements; pH; alkalinity estimates.
- Temporal resolution: frequent storm-driven sampling (1–2 week cadence for Black Wood; fortnightly for Old Pond Close).

## Analytical approach and context
- Edge effects on interception were quantified via a multi-distance, multi-plot design.
- Relative contributions of canopy interception, understory evaporation, and stemflow to net precipitation were assessed.
- Data collection included rigorous cross-site validation (two canopy rainfall towers) and move-and-reposition strategies to minimize bias.
- The Old Pond Close study contributed a detailed chemical and hydrological assessment over a year, with emphasis on net precipitation and throughfall chemistry to understand watershed-scale impacts.
