# Atmospheric inputs and Filtration and storage

## Overview
- Samples collected weekly to fortnightly to capture potentially high variability in throughfall and stemflow volumes and chemistry.
- An array of samplers employed to obtain representative values.

## Sampling methods

### Rainfall
- Collected with a polypropylene funnel on towers above the tree canopy.
- Samples stored in-field in 1 L polythene bottles.
- Returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.

### Throughfall
- Collected using 'roving' collectors randomly distributed within a block (Black Wood) or along a transect (Old Pond Close).

### Stemflow
- Collected with plastic silicone rubber collar tubing wrapped around the tree.
- Runoff collected in a large bin.

### Concurrent collection
- Throughfall and stemflow also collected simultaneously using runoff from a sheet collector attached to a series of trees.

## Streams
- Old Pond Close: one stream sampled by grab using a polythene bucket attached to a nylon cord.

## Filtration and storage

### Unfiltered samples
- Used for pH and alkalinity determination.
- Streams: kept in filled glass bottles prior to analysis to minimise CO2 degassing that would affect pH readings.
- Rainfall: degassing would occur as samples stood in the field.

### Filtration
- Samples filtered using 0.45 µm Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (47 mm diameter) under vacuum with a Millipore filter holder.

### Post-processing
- Unfiltered samples analyzed on the same day for pH and alkalinity.
- Filtered samples stored prior to cation analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.

### Anions and nutrients
- Stored without acidification (including silicon and ammonium).

### Storage and bottles
- Polypropylene bottles cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and rinsed with distilled water.
- Samples stored at 4 °C in the dark.
