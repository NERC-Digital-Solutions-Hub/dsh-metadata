# Atmospheric inputs

- Samples were collected on a weekly to fortnightly basis to capture high variability in throughfall and stemflow volumes and chemistry; multiple samplers were used to obtain representative values.
- Rainfall sampling: polypropylene funnel on towers above the canopy; samples stored in field in 1-litre polythene bottles; returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
- Throughfall sampling: roving collectors randomly distributed within a block (Black Wood) or along a transect (Old Pond Close).
- Stemflow sampling: plastic silicone rubber collar tubing wrapped around the tree; runoff collected in a large bin.
- Simultaneous collection of throughfall and stemflow using a sheet collector attached to a series of trees.
- Streams sampling at Old Pond Close: one stream sampled by grab using a polythene bucket attached to nylon cord.

## 2. Filtration and storage

- Samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing; both unfiltered and filtered samples required for chemical analysis.
- 2.1 Unfiltered samples: used for pH and alkalinity determination; streams kept in filled glass bottles prior to analysis to minimise CO2 degassing; rainfall samples would degas in the field.
- 2.2 Filtration: unfiltered samples filtered using 0.45 µm Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (47 mm) under vacuum with a Millipore filter holder.
- On return to the laboratory, unfiltered samples analysed on the same day for pH and alkalinity.
- Filtered samples stored prior to cation analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
- For anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium), samples stored without acidification.
- Storage bottles: polypropylene; cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and rinsed with distilled water.
- Storage conditions: 4°C in the dark.
