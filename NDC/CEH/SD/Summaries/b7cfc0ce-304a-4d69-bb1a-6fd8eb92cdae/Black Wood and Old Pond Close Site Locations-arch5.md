# Black Wood, UK County = Hampshire. Old Pond Close, UK County = Northamptonshire – Plot metadata records

## Overview
- A dataset of plot locations (Black Wood and Old Pond Close) with detailed metadata fields.
- Fields include: UK County, Start date (day, month, year), End date (day, month, year), grid reference, Notes.
- Notes contain citations to publications (e.g., Neal et al., 1994; Neal, 2002; Neal et al., 2004) and details about plot locations.
- Some records are incomplete or partially blank (represented by dots), indicating gaps in start/end dates, grid references, or county data.
- Context suggests these plots were used in atmospheric pollution interception/attenuation studies at forested sites.

## Metadata structure and content
- Plot entries present for:
  - Black Wood (Hampshire) with associated references and notes about plot location details.
  - Old Pond Close (Northamptonshire) with start/end dates and citations.
- Repeated fields include: Start date, End date, grid reference, and Notes, enabling traceability to original publications.
- Notes sections reference specific studies and publications to support provenance.

## Data quality and completeness
- Incomplete data is common (several fields missing or unspecified for multiple entries).
- Some records have precise date ranges; others lack start or end dates or grid references.
- Variability in data availability across entries, highlighting the need for data completion and standardization.

## Governance and sharing considerations for Data Stewards
- Standardization needs:
  - Normalize date formats and fill missing start/end dates where possible.
  - Standardize grid references and ensure consistent UK County values.
  - Normalize Notes to preserve provenance and publication references.
- Provenance and traceability:
  - Preserve citations (Neal et al., 1994; Neal, 2002; Neal et al., 2004) within the dataset notes to maintain data lineage.
- Access and licensing:
  - Review any publication-related location details for sharing restrictions; capture any embargo or access notes.
- Data curation workflow:
  - Engage data creators to chase and fill gaps, perform quality assurance, and transform data for portal/catalogue readiness.
  - Upload to relevant data portals and catalogue data holdings; document curation steps.

## Use cases and user needs
- Supports ecological and atmospheric pollution interception research at forested sites.
- Provides plot-level metadata (location, dating, provenance) to enable discovery, reuse, and cross-study comparisons.

## Challenges to address
- Incomplete user needs picture and prioritization.
- Timely receipt of data and consistent metadata from data creators.
- Working across many systems/formats and with outdated databases requiring bespoke solutions.
- Handling large datasets with gaps in key fields (dates, grid references, county).

## Recommendations for Data Stewards
- Implement rigorous metadata quality checks and require completion from data creators.
- Enforce data standards: consistent date formats, complete grid references, controlled vocabularies for notes.
- Document data lineage clearly in dataset metadata and catalog records.
- Communicate and apply any data sharing constraints or embargoes; ensure licensing is clear.
- Maintain provenance by preserving publication references in Notes and linking to source studies.

## Notable content highlights
- Publications cited within notes:
  - Neal et al., 1994: Interception of chemicals at a forest edge for a rural low-lying site at Black Wood, Hampshire.
  - Neal, 2002: Interception and attenuation of atmospheric pollution in a lowland ash forested site, Old Pond Close, Northamptonshire.
  - Neal et al., 2004: Details of plot locations referenced to Neal et al., 2004.

## Conclusion
- This document constitutes a multi-entry metadata record for plots used in atmospheric pollution interception research.
- Effective data stewardship requires addressing incomplete fields, standardizing metadata, preserving provenance, and ensuring accessible, well-documented data through appropriate cataloguing and sharing.
