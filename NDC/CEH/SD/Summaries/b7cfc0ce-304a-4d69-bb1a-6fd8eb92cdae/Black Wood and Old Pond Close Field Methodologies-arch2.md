# Atmospheric inputs

- Sampling frequency and design
  - Samples collected weekly to fortnightly to account for high variability in throughfall and stemflow volumes and chemistry.
  - A range of samplers used to obtain representative values.

- Rainfall sampling
  - Collected with a polypropylene funnel on towers above the tree canopy.
  - Samples stored in 1 L polythene bottles.
  - Processed at Wallingford Laboratories.

- Throughfall sampling
  - Collected with roving collectors randomly distributed within a Black Wood block or along an Old Pond Close transect.

- Stemflow sampling
  - Stemflow collected using plastic silicon rubber collar tubing wrapped around trees; runoff collected in a large bin.

- Combined canopy inputs
  - Throughfall and stemflow also collected simultaneously using a sheet collector attached to a series of trees.

- Stream sampling
  - At Old Pond Close, one stream sampled by grab sampling using a polythene bucket attached to a nylon cord.

- Filtration and storage (overview)
  - Samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
  - Both unfiltered and filtered samples required for chemical analysis.

- Unfiltered samples (for pH and alkalinity)
  - Unfiltered samples used for pH and alkalinity determinations.
  - Streams: stored in filled glass bottles to minimise CO2 degassing that would affect pH readings.
  - Rainfall: degassing expected as samples stood in the field.

- Filtration (2.2)
  - Filtration performed with 0.45 µm Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (47 mm) under vacuum using a Millipore filter holder.

- Post-processing and storage
  - Unfiltered samples analysed the same day for pH and alkalinity.
  - Filtered samples stored prior to cation analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated high-purity nitric acid.
  - Anions and nutrients (including silicon and ammonium) stored without acidification.
  - Storage bottles: polypropylene, cleaned with 10% hydrochloric acid and rinsed with distilled water.
  - Storage conditions: 4°C in the dark.
