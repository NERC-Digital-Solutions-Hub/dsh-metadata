# Black Wood, Hampshire

## Purpose and setting
- Forestry Commission’s Black Wood plantation (2.4 km2) near Micheldever, Hampshire; beech-dominated; monitoring to study interception gradients from forest edge.
- Climate and site: temperate, west-dominated winds, ~800 mm annual rainfall, soils shallow organic-rich over chalk; edge-oriented sampling due to wind exposure and topography.

## Monitoring design and data types
- Long-running setup since spring 1989, deploying a suite of sensors and collectors:
  - Soil moisture: neutron access tubes and tensiometers; automatic weather stations above canopy.
  - Rainfall and interception: rainfall collectors above canopy, throughfall collectors, stemflow collectors, plastic collars around trunks.
  - Throughfall sampling: relocatable circular gauges with small-mesh filters to prevent debris contamination.
  - Edge-focused sampling: block design with plots at 20, 50, 100, 200, and 350 m from the forest edge; each distance uses a row of three plots (~100 m2 per plot, four trees per plot).
  - Within each plot: eight throughfall samplers and four stemflow collectors; adjacent plots separated by ~60 m.
  - Edge comparison plot: central row, with a nearby plastic sheet rainfall gauge to compare net rainfall estimates.
- Sampling cadence: typically every 1–2 weeks; post-collection gauges moved to reduce bias.

## Data collection procedures
- Black Wood edge trials:
  - Rainfall above canopy captured with two towers; canalized via 7 mm tubing to base collection bottles.
  - Throughfall: roving gauges placed ~50 cm above ground; randomly relocated during sampling to capture spatial variability.
  - Net precipitation: 90 m2 plastic sheet collector enclosing four stems; large sample volumes; subsamples by splitting device; cannot directly assess understory evaporation.
  - Runoff: small stream sampled with clean 2 L bottles; bottles prepared with acid cleaning to avoid contamination.
- Data handling at collection:
  - Post-sampling, throughfall and precipitation samples combined as appropriate; volumes weighed to compute totals.
  - Attempt to minimize bias by relocating collectors between sampling visits.

## Analytical methods
- Chemical analysis of combined samples:
  - pH (electrometric)
  - Major, minor, and trace elements via ICP emission spectroscopy
  - Potassium via atomic absorption spectroscopy
  - Major anions and fluoride via ion chromatography
  - Ammonium and silicon via colorimetry
- Alkalinity:
  - Not directly measured; calculated using the relationship with pH (Alkalinity = 6 × 10^(pH−6) − 10^(6−pH)) and assuming equilibrium with atmospheric CO2.
- Units: measurements reported in standard hydrological chemistry units (e.g., μEq/L for alkalinity).

## Study area: Old Pond Close
- Location: 25 ha Forestry Commission woodland at Yardley Chase, near the Buckinghamshire–Northamptonshire border; ~7 km from Olney; ~30 km from Northampton and Milton Keynes.
- Site characteristics: ~110 m a.s.l.; common ash planted 1934; canopy ~16 m; calcareous soils (dark greyish-brown clay loam) over Oxford Clay; mean long-term precipitation ~589 mm (1970–1986); woodlands with understory bramble and grasses.
- Hydrological context: interception from ash canopy modeled at up to ~11% of precipitation (~65 mm); transpiration ~350–370 mm; potential summer water stress in dry years.
- Monitoring scope: precipitation, throughfall, net precipitation, and surface water drainage from an ephemeral stream; March 1991 to ~one year.

## Sampling and analysis (Old Pond Close)
- Precipitation: two 14.8-cm diameter plastic funnels above canopy on a tower; samples combined for chemical analysis.
- Throughfall: ten 15.2-cm roving gauges along a 100 m transect; gauges randomly relocated at sampling times to capture spatial variability; net catch includes canopy and understory throughfall.
- Net precipitation: 90 m2 plastic sheet collector enclosing four stems; volume-integrated sampling via tipping bucket; understory evaporation not captured.
- Runoff: spot samples from a small stream; clean bottles prepared with acid cleaning.

## Data handling and quality considerations
- Post-collection processing:
  - All samples filtered (0.45 μm membranes) on the day of sampling.
- Data quality challenges:
  - Interception measurements are inherently heterogeneous; roving gauges mitigate some spatial bias but variability remains high.
  - Net precipitation collection may not capture understory evaporation; sampling areas are large to reduce local biases.
- Data usage implications for stewardship:
  - Detailed, standardized protocols support reproducibility and future reuse.
  - Spatially explicit sampling design (edge distances, plot layout) enhances the ability to study edge effects and hydrological processes.
  - Comprehensive chemical analysis enables assessment of water quality and soil-plant interactions.
