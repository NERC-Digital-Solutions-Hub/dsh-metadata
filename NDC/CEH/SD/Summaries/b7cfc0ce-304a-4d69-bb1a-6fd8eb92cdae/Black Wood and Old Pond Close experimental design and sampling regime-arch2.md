# Black Wood, Hampshire

- Overview
  - Forestry Commission’s Black Wood plantation (2.4 km²) near Micheldever, southern England; beech (Fagus sylvatica) on limed agricultural land, planted ~2040 years ago.
  - Site chosen to study interception gradients from a forest edge within a flat, westerly-wind-dominated landscape.
  - Local climate: annual rainfall ~800 mm; mean temperatures 3°C (Jan) to 17°C (Aug); elevation 100–150 m.

- Monitoring setup and data collection
  - Instrumentation installed from spring 1989: neutron access tubes and tensiometers for soil moisture; automatic weather stations above canopy; plastic sheet net rainfall gauges; stemflow and throughfall collectors; canopy canopy rainfall collectors above the canopy and in a surrounding network.
  - Experimental design: block sampling to assess hydrological variability parallel and perpendicular to the forest edge; collectors relocated to reduce bias.
  - Edge-distance sampling: collectors positioned at ~20, 50, 100, 200, and 350 m from forest edge; practical constraints near edge limited some positions due to large trees and a road.
  - Plots: three plots per row, each ~100 m², bounding four trees; rows separated by ~60 m; within-plot setup included eight throughfall samplers and four stemflow collectors per plot; trunk collars used for stemflow collection.
  - Rainfall and throughfall measurements: two canopies-based rainfall towers (above canopy) with collectors; additional central plot comparison using a plastic sheet gauge near the edge.
  - Data handling: after each collection, throughfall gauges moved randomly within plots to minimize bias; volumes determined by weighing; stemflow volumes from collected bin water.

- Chemical analysis (Black Wood)
  - Samples subjected to a suite of analyses: pH (electrometric), major/minor/trace elements (ICP-OES), potassium (AAS), major anions and fluoride (ion chromatography), ammonium and silicon (colorimetry).
  - Alkalinity not measured directly; calculated using a simplified relation with pH to yield μEq/L, assuming equilibrium with the atmosphere.

- Outputs and purpose
  - Aimed to quantify interception gradients and interactions at the forest edge; generate datasets of precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, and net precipitation for interpretation of edge effects and hydrological processes.

- References and methodological basis
  - Methodological inspirations and precedents cited (Wilm 1943; Helvey & Patric 1965; Lloyd & de O. Marques 1988) to estimate required numbers of throughfall collectors; related instrument descriptions and sampling strategies referenced throughout.

- Data management and access considerations
  - Emphasis in monitoring practice on standardised data collection and clear presentation formats (reports, maps, charts) with appropriate data stewardship, in line with aims to enable subsequent data use and scrutiny (contextual note from archetype).

# Old Pond Close

- Study area context
  - 25 ha Forestry Commission woodland at eastern Yardley Chase, ~7 km NW of Olney, near the Buckinghamshire–Northamptonshire border; ~30 km from Northampton, Bedford, and Milton Keynes.
  - Elevation ~110 m, surrounded by gently undulating agricultural land; vegetation dominated by common ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) planted in 1934, average height ~16 m; dense understory with bramble and grasses.
  - Soils: calcareous dark greyish-brown clay loam, low permeability, over Oxford Clay (Upper Jurassic).
  - Long-term precipitation (1970–1986) ~589 mm; interception by ash canopy plus understory modeled up to ~11% (~65 mm); transpiration ~350–370 mm; potential summer water stress in low-precipitation years.

- Sampling and analysis (methodology)
  - Monitoring period: March 1991 to early March 1992 (just over 1 year), fortnightly sampling.
  - Data collected: precipitation (including snow), throughfall, net precipitation, and surface water drainage from an ephemeral stream.
  - Precipitation measurements: two 14.8 cm funnels above canopy on a tower; plastic funnels combined for chemical analysis.
  - Throughfall measurements: 10 roving gauges, 15.2 cm diameter, with funnels ~50 cm above ground; gauges randomly relocated along a 100 m transect to account for spatial variability.
  - Net precipitation: plastic sheet collector over a 90 m² area enclosing four stems; volume-integrating sampling using a tipping-bucket device.
  - Runoff: spot samples from the main plantation’s small stream, collected in clean 2 L bottles; bottles pre-cleaned with acid and distilled water.
  - Sample handling: replicates combined; volumes weighed to determine totals; samples filtered (0.45 μm) on the day of sampling.
  - Chemical analysis: precipitation, throughfall, net precipitation, and stream water analyzed for pH, major/minor/trace elements (ICP-OES), potassium (AAS), major anions and fluoride (ion chromatography), ammonium and silicon (colorimetry).
  - Data interpretation notes: throughfall is highly heterogeneous and challenging to quantify accurately; net precipitation provides a broader-area measure that integrates stemflow and throughfall, but understory evaporation is not directly assessed.

- Outputs and purpose
  - Focused on quantifying interception and its contribution to catchment hydrology in a ash-dominated woodland; data intended to inform understanding of canopy and understory interactions with precipitation and runoff in temperate deciduous woodland.

- References and methodological basis
  - Sampling and analytical approaches align with established hydrological interception studies and prior findings (Neal et al.; Calder & Rosier; Hardy et al.; Neals et al.).

- Data management and access considerations
  - The document presents detailed, longitudinal data collection methods and analyses appropriate for compiling standardized environmental datasets; aligns with aims to create transparent, comparable outputs suitable for broader environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
