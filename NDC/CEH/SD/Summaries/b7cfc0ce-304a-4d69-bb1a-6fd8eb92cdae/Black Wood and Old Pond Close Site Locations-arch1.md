## Data quality and limitations
- Many fields contain missing data or placeholders (e.g., ".", multiple unspecified entries), indicating incomplete standardization.
- Information is largely locational and bibliographic; no measured results or quantitative metrics are included in the excerpt.
- Requires data cleaning and standardization to support robust analyses (e.g., cross-site comparisons, temporal analyses).

## Analytical implications
- Useful for mapping site distribution and linking to published interception studies.
- Provides bibliographic anchors for meta-analyses of forest interception and pollution attenuation.
- Highlights typical data-collection challenges faced by analysts: local-scale data gaps, inconsistent field entries, and need for standardized metadata.
