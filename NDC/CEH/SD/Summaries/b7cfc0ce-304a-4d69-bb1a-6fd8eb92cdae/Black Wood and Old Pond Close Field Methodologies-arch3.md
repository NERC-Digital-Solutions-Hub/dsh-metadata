# Atmospheric inputs

- Sampling frequency and design to capture high variability in throughfall and stemflow volumes and chemistry (weekly to fortnightly; array of samplers used for representativeness).
- Rainfall sampling method: polypropylene funnel on towers above the canopy; samples stored in 1 L polythene bottles; returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing.
- Throughfall sampling: roving collectors randomly distributed within a block or along a transect.
- Stemflow sampling: plastic silicone rubber collar tubing affixed to trees; runoff collected in a large bin.
- Concurrent sampling: throughfall and stemflow collected simultaneously using a sheet collector attached to a series of trees.
- Stream sampling at Old Pond Close: grab sampling with a polythene bucket attached to a nylon chord.
- 2.0 Filtration and storage: samples returned to Wallingford Laboratories for processing; both unfiltered and filtered samples required for chemical analysis.
  - 2.1 Unfiltered samples: used for pH and alkalinity; streams kept in filled glass bottles to minimise CO2 degassing; rainfall samples degassed by standing in the field.
  - 2.2 Filtration: samples filtered using 0.45 µm Whatman cellulose nitrate filters under vacuum.
  - Processing and storage: unfiltered samples analysed the same day for pH and alkalinity; filtered samples stored prior to cation analysis after acidification to 1% with concentrated HNO3; anions and nutrients stored without acidification.
  - Containers and storage conditions: polypropylene bottles cleaned with 10% HCl and rinsed with distilled water; stored at 4°C in the dark.
