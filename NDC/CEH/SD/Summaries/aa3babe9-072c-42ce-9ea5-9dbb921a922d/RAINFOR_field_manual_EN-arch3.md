# RAINFOR Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement

## Overview and aims
- Tropical Amazonia forests: critical for global carbon, climate, and biodiversity.
- RAINFOR uses long-term permanent plots to monitor biomass, turnover, ecophysiology, and relationships to climate/soils.
- Objectives include quantifying long-term biomass changes, linking structure to climate/soils, understanding productivity and mortality, informing basin-scale carbon models, and investigating biodiversity patterns.
- Emphasizes methodology standardization and cross-site comparability; encourages discussion of issues and protocol harmonization.

## Plot design and site selection (A–H)
- Pan-Amazon strategy: maintain plots across edaphic and climatic zones; new plots randomly located within geomorphological strata that meet logistical criteria.
- Criteria for new plots: homogeneous soil parent material and type, adequate access, long-term protection from disturbance, institutional support; avoid areas of anthropogenic disturbance unless needed for study.
- Challenges: habitat/soil maps may be lacking; remote sensing and local knowledge used to identify vegetation types; practical constraints include distance from field base and landscape fragmentation.
- Positioning: within strata, plots should be randomly located to avoid bias; randomization before field work where possible.
  
## Plot timing, orientation, shape, and size (I–H)
- Timing: measure plots over whole-year intervals, ideally during periods of minimum soil moisture variation; in El Niño regions, wet season timing is preferred.
- Orientation: align principal axes with N/S or E/W where possible; latitude, longitude, and elevation recorded; true vs. magnetic north noted.
- Shape: preference for shapes that minimize edge effects; both square and rectangular plots used to balance edge bias and practical constraints.
- Size and subplots: standard 1 ha plots; convenient 20 x 20 m subplots for detailed sampling; plot boundaries segmented into 20 m units.
- Topography and slope: measure boundaries; apply slope corrections when necessary (d = 20 / cos(theta)) to standardize land-surface area across plots.
- Visibility: markers should be durable but inconspicuous; corner stakes and edge markers used to aid relocation.

## Plot layout and relocation (I–J)
- Stringing: a four-person team (compass, line cutter, distance measurer, string layer) for precise delimitation.
- Relocation: permanent markers to aid long-term remeasurement; ensure edge markers do not unduly attract attention.

## Tagging, measurement, and measurement points (K–M)
- Tagging: trees included if >50% roots are inside plot; tag at consistent height (generally 1.3 m POM unless specified); tag placement standardized to aid future identification; large buttressed trees may require off-plot measurement or later follow-up.
- POM (Point of Measurement): standardized measurement height for trees; note deviations when POM differs due to deformities or buttresses; chalk paint POM location and repaint for visibility.
- Special cases: buttresses, deformities, fluted stems, leaning trees, fallen trees, stilt roots, resprouts, and multi-stemmed individuals require explicit rules for measurement and tagging; lianas are included with specific criteria and additional notes.
- Liana protocols: record three measurement points per liana stem (d1.3length, d1.3height, dmax) to maximize time-series comparability; tag and measure based on 10 cm diameter threshold; define climbing relationships with host trees for interaction analyses.

## Tree and liana measurement details (M–N)
- Tree measurement: measure at or near the POM (1.3 m) where possible; alternative POM documented; precise measurement points marked with chalk and painted for visibility.
- Liana measurement: document liana stems with three diametric measurements; record host tree associations and canopy interactions; special rules for when lianas are connected or difficult to separate.
- Data recording for both: subplot, coordinates, tag, species, diameter(s), POM, measurement method (ladder, Relaskop, camera), and any special notes about morphology or damage.

## Data recording and data management (N–Q)
- Plot data organization: one Excel file per plot; three worksheets for trees, lianas, and site details; fields include coordinates, tag, taxonomy, diameters, POM, measurement method, and site metadata.
- Recorder responsibilities: maintain consistent field sheets; use separate rows for multi-stemmed trees; separate sheets for Relaskop/digital camera measurements; include field notes and data adjustments.
- Data quality and corrections: track original measurements, presumed errors, and corrections; use ForestPlots.net workflow for upload and quality control; document anomalous recruits, missing census data, and abnormal growth.
- Correction for optical measurements: optical diameter measurements systematically underestimate true diameter; apply a correction formula and note typical error magnitude (~0.5%) increasing with tree size and observation distance.

## Special measurements and materials (O–P)
- Wood density: rapid stand-level wood density estimates via branch samples; measure maximum/minimum diameters with calipers; dry and weigh to compute density; useful for biomass estimates beyond basal area.
- Botanical collection: collects morphospecies not identifiable in the field; press and herbarium voucher; link duplicates to reference vouchers; record collector initials and collection numbers.

## Mortality, recruitment, and error handling (D–F)
- Mortality and recruitment: unique alive/dead codes; recensus involves two people, tagging and measuring recruits with reference to nearest tagged tree; use markers for unidentified recruits.
- Dealing with errors: review measurements for consistency; remeasure when unexpected changes occur; follow spatial sequencing to locate lost tags; maintain traceable audit of data manipulations.

## Remeasurement logistics and buttress management (Appendix-like guidance)
- Re-measurement of 1-ha plots: typical field allocation; time estimates for relocation, tagging, mapping, and botanical collection; planning for rain delays.
- Buttress and POM changes: field guides specify when to adjust POM (e.g., measure above buttress if it encroaches on the original POM); document all changes and rationale; various scenarios (non-buttress POM changes, buttress changes) have explicit protocols to maintain unbiased growth records.

## Data processing and post-field management (G)
- Data handling: upload to ForestPlots.net; follow post-field data handling procedures; quality control to address issues like unlikely recruits, missing census information, and growth anomalies.
- Record-keeping: preserve original measurements, error, and corrections; ForestPlots.net supports documenting data manipulations.

## Measurement technique and post-field codes (Appendices and flags)
- Codes for alive status, mode of death, measurement technique, post-field data management, and height measurement technique are provided for trees and lianas; specific codes cover multiple conditions (e.g., liana host status, canopy infestation, and crown formation).
- Appendix 2 provides a detailed key to liana and host death processes, including interactions with hosts and various death mechanisms.
- Guidelines emphasize using a single measurement technique per tree/liana, with options for optical, Relaskop, camera, and traditional tape methods; post-field modifications are codified to ensure traceability.

## Practical implications for monitoring framework authors
