# RAINFOR Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement

- The document outlines standardized, long-term field procedures for establishing and remeasuring permanent sample plots across the Amazon to monitor biomass, turnover, ecophysiology, biodiversity, and their relationships to climate and soils.
- Aimed at enabling cross-site comparisons and informing basin-scale carbon and forest dynamics models.
- Emphasises the need to standardise methodologies, assess methodological changes over time, and promote data sharing with metadata.

## Overview and Aims of RAINFOR
- Use permanent plots (PSPs) to quantify long-term forest biomass, turnover, productivity, mortality, and biodiversity.
- Relate forest structure and dynamics to local climate and soils; develop relationships to predict climate-change impacts on Amazonia.
- Promote cross-site methodological discussion and standardisation of protocols.
- Data are organized to support regional analyses and model parameterisation; datasets are uploaded to ForestPlots.net with metadata.

## Plot Location and Design (A–H)
- A. Location: Pan-Amazon sampling across edaphic and climatic ranges; plots chosen in homogeneous soils, with good access, long-term security, and institutional support; avoid ongoing disturbance unless explicitly studied.
- B. Position: Within strata, plots are randomly located to avoid bias; random start points if maps exist; in-field randomisation to reduce bias.
- C. Timing: Measure over full-year intervals; time measurements to minimize soil-water variation; wet-season timing preferred in El Niño–affected areas.
- D. Orientation: Record plot center coordinates (latitude, longitude, elevation) and bearings; note true vs magnetic north.
- E. Shape: Both square and rectangular plots used to balance edge effects and ease of access.
- F. Size: Standard 1 hectare plots; 20 × 20 m subplots.
- G. Topography: Boundary delineation in 20 m segments; apply slope corrections (d = 20 / cos θ) to relate to land-surface area; plan for comparable area across plots.
- H. Visibility: Use durable, discreet markers; ensure plots can be relocated reliably; consider stake placement for long-term monitoring.

## Plot Establishment and Positioning (I–J)
- I. Stringing: Four-person setup for accurate plot delimitation, with minimal disturbance to vegetation.
- J. Tagging trees: Systematic tagging at 1.60 m or 30 cm above the POM when trees are tagged at 1.6 m; consistent tagging order around subplots; special handling for vines, resprouts, and multi-stemmed individuals; document special cases (e.g., fallen trees, buttresses).

## Tree Measurement Protocols (K–N)
- K. Tree measurement: Measure diameter at breast height (POM at 1.3 m where possible); record POM height if not at 1.3 m; document special cases (buttresses, deformities, fluting, leaning, fallen trees, stilt roots, resprouts, multiple stems); large buttress trees may require ladders and, rarely, camera-based diameter estimation with photographic reference scales; paint POM and measurement marks; maintain consistent measurement rules across conditions.
- L. Liana measurement: Measure lianas >10 cm diameter; record at three points (d1.3length, d1.3height, dmax); tag and map lianas and their host trees; address complexities in liana-host relationships; mark lianas entering plots as needed; treat intertwined stems with standardized conventions to maximise comparability.
- M. Data recording: For Trees, capture subplot, coordinates, tag, species, DBH, POM, measurement method, and bole form; for Lianas, capture subplot, coordinates, tag, species, diameters at specified points, host trees, and affected crown data; subplots and plot-level metadata (latitude, longitude, elevation, slope, bearings, landmarks, rooting depth) are recorded; annually revised entries should be kept consistent.
- N. Tree bole length and total height: Record tree heights to support diameter–height modelling and biomass estimation; use laser hypsometer when possible; if not, apply trigonometric methods across size classes; provide a method to estimate bole height using measurements to main branches and crown top; specify viewpoints to minimise error.

## Wood Density, Botany, and Additional Measurements (O–P)
- O. Wood density: Rapid stand-density proxy via branch density measurements; collect branch samples, measure fresh and dry volumes and masses to calculate density; useful for refining biomass estimates beyond basal-area-based methods.
- P. Botanical collection: Collect morphospecies not identifiable in the field for voucher-based identification; limit duplicates by field identification, link collections with collector IDs and voucher numbers; support long-term floristic comparisons.

## Operational Planning and Timings (Q)
- Q. Suggested timing and personnel for a 1-ha new plot: Approximately 48 person-days, distributed across locating/stringing (2 days), tagging/painting/mapping/measurement (3 days), large-tree measurements (1.5 days), topography (0.5 days), botanical collection (about 10 days in diverse forests); contingency for weather and delays.
- For relocating existing plots, field-time is reduced but requires careful recounting and validation of previously tagged trees and plots.

## Field Relocation, Buttress Handling, and Errors (A–E under Relocation)
- A. Stringing for relocations uses previous plot bearings and edge stakes; ensure relocation does not exclude previously tagged trees or include untagged large trees.
- B. Tree and liana measurement on relabeled plots uses the same protocols; if buttresses change, adjust POMs to ensure consistent above-buttress measurements.
- C. Buttress and deformity management: document POM changes and apply standardized guidelines to maintain unbiased diameter growth estimates; multiple POM-change scenarios are codified to ensure continuity.
- D. Mortality and recruitment: record death modes and status using standardized codes; recruit new individuals with high-visibility tagging and spatial numbering.
- E. Dealing with errors: actively check for inconsistencies and remeasure when necessary; maintain a record of original measurements, suspected errors, and corrections; conduct recensusing with attention to tag loss and plot edge integrity.

## Data Processing, Quality Control, and Data Management (G)
- Data collected are uploaded to ForestPlots.net; follow post-field data handling procedures and QC protocols to address anomalies (e.g., unlikely recruits, missing census data, abnormal growth).
- Maintain traceability by recording original measurements, errors, and corrections; ForestPlots.net supports documenting data manipulations.
- Plot data are organized as one Excel file per plot with three worksheets (trees, lianas, site) and standardized columns; rows represent stems (one row per stem; multi-stemmed individuals have separate rows).

## Optical Diameters and Measurement Corrections (Section on Optical Camera Measurements)
- Optical diameter measurements systematically underestimate true diameter; apply a correction formula to estimate the true radius from measured radius and observation geometry.
- Typical correction yields ~0.5% error per tree diameter, with larger errors for larger trees or shorter observation distances.

## Appendix and Coding Systems (Appendix 1 & 2)
- Provides standardized codes for Alive Status (FLAG 1), Mode of Death (FLAG 2), Measurement Technique (FLAG 3), Post-field Data Management (FLAG 4), and Height Measurement Technique (FLAG 5) for both trees and (where applicable) for lianas.
- Includes detailed classification schemes for tree death (standing, broken, uprooted, etc.) and liana death, host interactions, and crown/illumination status (Dawkins index modifications).
- Appendix 2 expands on detailed death typologies and crown-formation/illumination classifications, used to support robust, comparable mortality and canopy-light analyses.

## Data Sharing and References
- Emphasises discoverability and comparability of data through standardized metadata, plot-level information, and documented measurement techniques.
- References foundational work on tropical forest plot methods and the RAINFOR network, underscoring the methodological basis for cross-site analyses.

- Overall, the manual provides comprehensive, standardized instructions for establishing, maintaining, and remeasuring Amazonian forest plots, with explicit protocols for tree and liana measurements, data recording, quality control, and data management to enable robust, comparative, long-term ecological analyses.
