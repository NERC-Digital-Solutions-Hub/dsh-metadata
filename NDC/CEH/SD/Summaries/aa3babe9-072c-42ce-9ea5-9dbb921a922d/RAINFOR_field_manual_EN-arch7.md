# RAINFOR Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement

- The manual outlines how to establish and remeasure permanent forest plots in Amazonia for the RAINFOR network.
- Primary aim is to generate standardized, map-based data to quantify forest biomass, structure, dynamics, and biodiversity across the Amazon.

## Key Objectives and Scope
- Use long-term permanent plots to monitor biomass, turnover, ecophysiology, and relationships with climate and soils.
- Promote methodological discussion and standardization of forest inventory protocols across sites.
- Facilitate integration of field data into regional models of carbon dynamics and biodiversity analyses.

## Plot Design and Sampling Framework
- Pan-Amazon strategy: maintain plots across edaphic and climatic variation; ensure random placement within geomorphological strata that meet logistics and security criteria.
- New plots should be on homogeneous soil materials, accessible, secure, and free from major anthropogenic disturbance (unless explicitly studied).
- Random-location requirement within strata to avoid bias; random starting point if maps exist; otherwise randomize in field.

## Spatial and Temporal Planning
- Plots are designed to capture a 1-hectare area, subdivided into 20 m x 20 m subplots; plot boundaries are documented with bearings and coordinates.
- Timing aims to minimize measurement error from seasonal soil moisture; where El Niño causes variation, measurements targeted for wet season.
- Recording includes latitude, longitude, elevation, plot boundary bearings, and local landmarks to aid relocation.

## Plot Geometry and Measurement Considerations
- Shape options: square or rectangular plots; both used to manage edge effects and disturbance bias.
- Topography: distances may be corrected for slope (d = 20 / cos θ) to standardize land-surface area across slopes.
- Visibility and relocation: use permanent, discreet markers; ensure markers enable repeat relocation over years.

## Plot Relocation and Stringing
- Relocation relies on stringing along outer edges using existing tagged trees and bearings; verify that relocation does not exclude previously tagged trees or include untagged large trees.
- For reuse of older plots, string along subplot edges to preserve sequence and edge definitions.

## Tagging, Plot Setup, and Subplot Delineation
- Use a four-person team for laying out the base line and subplots; ensure consistent tagging order and spatial sequencing.
- Permanent markers at plot corners; stake placement and edge marking are designed to minimize long-term edge effects.

## Tree and Liana Measurement Protocols
- Tree measurement: measure at 1.3 m height (POM) where possible; alternatives documented (e.g., if deformities, buttresses, or edges require adjustment).
- POM and measurement points are painted and recorded; include multiple stems for multi-stemmed individuals.
- Liana measurement: record at three points on each stem (d1.3 length, d1.3 height, and dmax) to maximize comparability over time.
- Lianas are tagged as needed; main host relationships are recorded for liana-host interactions.

## Data Recording and Field Sheets
- Data are stored in one plot-specific Excel file with three worksheets: Trees, Lianas, Site details (sub-plot and plot data).
- Required fields include: subplot, X/Y coordinates, tag, taxonomy, species, diameters at specified heights, POM, measurement method, and notes on field conditions.
- Separate sheets/columns used for relaskop/digital camera measurements and for manual or alternative measurement methods.

## Special Measurement Rules and Complexities
- Buttressed, leaning, fluted, resprouting, and fallen trees require specific POM adjustments and documented procedures to avoid bias in basal area and growth estimates.
- For large buttressed trees, a separate, intensive measurement session may be required (often two people over a day).
- Liana measurement includes addressing ambiguities in where lianas start and how to treat connected or crossing stems; record maximum diameters and three standardized measurement points.

## Data Quality Control and Processing
- Field data are uploaded to ForestPlots.net; follow post-field data handling and QC protocols to address missing data, unlikely recruits, and measurement corrections.
- Always preserve original measurements, document presumed errors, and record corrections; use ForestPlots.net tools to log data manipulations.

## Data Management and Formats
- After field work, data are organized as one Excel file per plot with three worksheets (trees, lianas, site details).
- Key columns capture plot and stem identifiers, coordinates, species, diameters, POM, measurement methods, and notes about data handling.
- Optical diameter measurements are corrected using a defined geometric correction formula to account for measurement bias; typical error is about 0.5% of measured diameter, increasing with tree size and observation distance.

## Measurement Techniques and Coding
- Field measurements may use tape, relascope, digital camera, ladders, or direct measurement; each technique is coded.
- Data management codes document post-field modifications (interpolations, extrapolations, corrections, etc.) and height measurement methods.
- Flag systems exist to document alive status, mode of death, measurement technique, post-field data management, and height measurement method for both trees and, separately, for lianas.

## Botany, Density, and Sample Collection
- Botanical collections are integrated for long-term floristic comparability; morphospecies needing species-level identification are collected and curated in herbaria with proper collection metadata.

## Resource and Timeline Overview
- Typical planning for a new 1-ha plot involves about 48 person-days for setup, plus additional time for botanical collection and potential rain delays.
- Recensus of a 1-ha plot requires about 13 person-days, with ongoing field logistics and potential variations by site biodiversity.

## References and Related Tools
- Data management and analysis are supported by ForestPlots.net and related field manuals; standard references underpin taxonomy, plot design, and mortality/death coding conventions.
- Appendices provide detailed codes for alive status, mode of death, measurement technique, and post-field data management, plus specialized keys for lianas and canopy interactions.
