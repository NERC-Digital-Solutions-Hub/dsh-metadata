# RAINFOR Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement

- Global aim: Standardize long-term inventory plots across the Amazon to quantify forest biomass, dynamics, productivity, mortality, and biodiversity, enabling robust basin-scale carbon modelling and comparisons across sites.
- Core approach: Use permanent plots (PSPs) in a pan-Amazon framework, with consistent methodologies and data management to overcome cross-site methodological differences.

## Plot location, design, and sampling framework

- Pan-Amazon strategy: maintain plots across edaphic and climatic variation within clusters; new plots randomly located within local geomorphological strata.
- Plot criteria for new sites: homogeneous soil material, adequate access, long-term disturbance avoidance, institutional support, and security; exclude areas with anthropogenic disturbance unless explicitly studied.
- Within strata: random plot placement to avoid bias; if maps exist, randomize starting point and direction (>50 m from potential bias).
- Timing considerations: measure plots over whole-year intervals; align with wet season in areas with El Niño-driven rainfall variation.
- Plot orientation and metadata: record bearings, latitude, longitude, elevation; document true vs magnetic north as applicable.
- Plot shape and size: standardize to 1 ha with subplots of 20 x 20 m; shape affects edge effects and disturbance sensitivity.
- Boundaries and visibility: use fixed markers; ensure relocatability with markers that are not conspicuous; use a string-tracking method to outline plot edges.

## Plot layout, topography, and boundaries

- Topography: measure external/internal subplot boundaries in 20 m segments; corrections may be needed for slope to standardize land-area across plots.
- Layout choices: square vs rectangular subplots used to balance edge effects and disturbance biases.
- Relocation aids: precise coordinates and landmarks to assist re-establishment of plots in future resurveys.

## Field personnel, timing, and planning

- New 1-ha plot setup: approx. 48 person-days (3–4 people for strung plotting; 4 for tagging/mapping/measurement; 2 for large trees and heights; botanical work 10 days).
- Plot relocation (stringing) for existing plots: around 0.5–1 day depending on tag retention and edge conditions.
- Recensusing a 1-ha plot: approx. 13 person-days (relying on updated protocols for remeasurement and recruit collection).

## Tree and liana measurement protocols

- Measurement point (POM): standard at 1.3 m where possible; use a marked pole to define POM; alternative heights noted for buttressed, leaning, or deformed individuals.
- Tree tagging: tag trees systematically, measure and map within subplots; use nails for POM and ensure tags remain legible over time.
- Measurements for trees: record diameter at POM, height where possible, and details such as buttresses, deformities, fluted stems, resprouts, and multi-stemmed individuals.
- Liana measurements: measure each liana stem >10 cm dmax at three points:
  1) 1.3 m length from rooting point (d1.3length)
  2) 1.3 m height above ground (d1.3height)
  3) maximum diameter within 2.5 m of ground (dmax)
  - Tag lianas and record host tree associations where applicable; treat climbers with care to distinguish separate individuals.
- POM changes: document when POM is adjusted (buttress growth, deformity, etc.) and maintain consistent above-buttress measurements where appropriate.

## Data capture and recording structure

- Data sheets and uploads: data collected are uploaded to ForestPlots.net; follow the ForestPlots.net post-field data handling and QC procedures.
- Plot organization: one Excel file per plot with three worksheets (trees, lianas, site). Rows contain one stem per row; multiple stems in a single tree get separate rows.
- Required fields for trees:
  - Subplot, X/Y coordinates, Tag, family/species, diameter (mm), POM, measurement method (ladder/Relaskop/digital camera), bole form, notes on measurement conditions.
- Required fields for lianas:
  - Subplot, X/Y, Tag, family/species, diameters at 1.3 m (length and height) and max diameter, host associations.
- Subplot and site data: latitude, longitude, elevation, plot boundary bearings, local landmarks, soil texture/drainage, and root depth for fallen trees.
- Data quality: include observations of field conditions (leaning, fluted, etc.), and keep notes on any data manipulations or corrections.

## Measurement techniques and data corrections

- Optical diameter corrections: ground-based diameter estimates via optical methods underestimate true diameter; a defined correction formula is provided to adjust measured diameters (approx. 0.5% of diameter error, increasing with tree size and closer observation distances).
- Measurement technique flags (for each tree/liana):
  - Flag 3: measurement technique (0 tape, 1 relascope, 2 digital camera, etc.)
  - Flag 4: post-field data management (extrapolation, interpolation, correction, etc.)
  - Flag 5: height measurement technique (eye estimate, clinometer, laser hypsometer, etc.)
- POM changes: when POM is altered due to buttress or deformity, follow standardized change guides to ensure continuity of growth estimates.

## Data management, quality control, and submission

- Data upload: use ForestPlots.net for central storage; adhere to its data handling guidelines.
- Quality control: apply a defined QC protocol to address issues such as unlikely recruits, missing census data, and anomalous growth; preserve an original-measurement vs corrected-measurement audit trail.
- Documentation: maintain field sheet notations and comments to explain adjustments; use a clear, consistent notation system for corrections and uncertainties.
- Post-field data handling: ensure consistent formatting, unit conventions, and coding across sites for robust cross-site analyses.

## Supplemental data and protocols

- Wood density: collect branch samples for rapid stand-level density estimates to improve biomass calculations; density is computed as dry weight divided by fresh volume.
- Botanical collection: collect morphospecies not identifiable in field; press and curate vouchers; record collector initials and collection number; link to reference vouchers.
- Botany timing: botanical collection is time-intensive; plan accordingly.

## Liana- and tree-specific coding and interpretation

- Alive status (Tree and Liana): coded values for alive, dead, resprouts, liana presence, multiple stems, etc., with combination rules (e.g., alive with liana, new recruit, etc.).
- Mode of death (Tree and Liana): codes for physical mechanism, number of trees/lianas involved, and killer process (anthropogenic, lightning, wind, strangler, liana interaction, etc.).
- Crown attributes: crown formation, crown illumination indices, and liana crown infestation levels to track canopy interactions.
- Host relationships: main host tag numbers and whether hosts are inside or outside plots to contextualize liana dynamics.

## Appendices and references

- Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 provide detailed coding schemes for tree death, liana death, crown status, and crown illumination.
- References include foundational methods for tropical forest plots, biomass estimation, and long-term monitoring practices.

- Key takeaway: RAINFOR provides a comprehensive, standardized framework for establishing, measuring, recording, and maintaining long-term tropical forest plots, with rigorous data management workflows to enable cross-site biomass, productivity, biodiversity, and climate-related analyses.
