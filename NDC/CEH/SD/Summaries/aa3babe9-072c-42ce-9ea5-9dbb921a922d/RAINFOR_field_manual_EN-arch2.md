RAINFOR Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement

- Purpose and context
  - Establishes a pan-Amazonian network (RAINFOR) of long-term permanent plots to monitor forest biomass, dynamics, soil and climate relationships.
  - Aims to quantify long-term changes, relate structure and function to climate/soil, understand productivity, mortality and biomass relationships, inform basin-scale carbon models, and examine biodiversity patterns.
  - Emphasizes standardization across sites to enable robust temporal comparisons and to facilitate access to underlying data.

- Data, standardization, and outputs
  - Provides standardized field protocols for plot establishment, remeasurement, and data handling to minimise methodological differences between sites.
  - Encourages discussion of methods and harmonization of forest inventory protocols.
  - Data are uploaded to ForestPlots.net with a quality-control workflow to ensure data integrity and comparability.
  - Outputs include datasets on biomass, growth, mortality, recruitment, productivity, and biodiversity across Amazonia.

- Plot design and global sampling strategy
  - Pan-Amazon strategy: maintain plots across edaphic and climatic variation; new plots randomly located within geomorphological strata satisfying logistical criteria.
  - New plot criteria: homogenous soil material, good access, long-term security from disturbance, institutional support, and minimal anthropogenic disturbance unless explicitly studied.
  - Challenges: limited habitat maps and coarse geomorphology at large scales; local knowledge and satellite data used to aid stratification and site selection.

- Plot layout and geographic positioning
  - Plots are 1 hectare (ha) with 20 x 20 m subplots; boundaries are measured in 20 m segments.
  - Plot orientation is flexible to local topography; latitude, longitude, elevation, and bearing of boundaries are recorded.
  - Random placement within strata to avoid bias; if maps exist, randomize starting points beyond 50 m from potential bias areas.

- Timing, seasonality, and relocation
  - Measurements should be made over whole-year intervals to minimize variation in stem water content; timing aligned with wet season in areas with strong El Niño variability.

- Plot shape, size, and topography
  - Preference for 1 ha plots; either square or rectangular shapes; both used depending on edge effects and access.
  - Topographic corrections may be applied when calculating area that lies on slopes to ensure comparability.

- Visibility, marking, and data integrity
  - Permanent markers are used cautiously to avoid attracting attention; fixed corner stakes are typical.
  - Relocation requires accurate edge strings and use of existing maps to maintain continuity.

- Tagging, plots, and subplots
  - Trees and, where relevant, lianas are tagged and mapped systematically within each subplot.
  - Tagging and measurement order is designed to minimize edge effects and ensure repeatability.

- Tree measurement protocols
  - Measurement height (POM) is standardized at 1.3 m where possible; if not feasible due to buttresses or deformities, the POM height is recorded and alternative measurement strategies are used.
  - Diameters are recorded with standardized methods and multiple stems are measured where present.
  - Special cases handled: buttressed trees, leaning trees, broken stems, fluted trees, resprouts, and large buttresses; where necessary, measurements above buttresses or alternative POMs are used to maintain comparability.
  - When POM cannot be reached for large trees, a digital camera method can be employed with careful calibration and eventual back-calculation; a correction is applied to account for optical bias.

- Liana measurement protocols
  - Lianas are included if they reach 10 cm diameter at any point within 2.5 m of the ground and are measured at three defined points (d1.3length, d1.3height, dmax) to ensure comparability across time and sites.
  - Liana tagging and measurement follow protocols to distinguish separate stems and to account for host interactions.

- Data recording requirements
  - Detailed field data for trees and lianas include subplot, coordinates, tag, species, diameter measurements at multiple POMs, presence of buttresses, climbing behavior, liana canopy interactions, and host tree information.
  - Subplot and plot-level data include maps, slopes, soil texture, drainage, coordinates, elevation, and major landmarks.
  - Additional measurements include tree height, canopy illumination, liana-host relationships, and other ecological interactions.

- Tree bole length, height, and allometric data
  - Tree heights are measured to complement diameter data for biomass modelling and to characterize height-diameter relationships under varying environmental conditions.
  - When full height measurement is not possible, a representative, stratified sampling of individuals across DBH classes is conducted using laser hypsometry or validated trigonometric methods.

- Wood density and botanical collections
  - Wood density is measured rapidly using branch samples to improve biomass estimates and to characterize species composition.
  - Botanical collection of morphospecies is conducted for later identification; duplicates are avoided in the field when possible and voucher numbers are recorded for traceability.

- Timing and field personnel for a 1-ha plot
  - A detailed staffing plan is provided (stringing, tagging, mapping, measurement, topography, botanical collection), with estimated person-days to plan logistics and budget.

- Relocation and remeasurement procedures
  - When relocating a plot, edge strings and previous tree tags guide remeasurement; careful checks ensure consistency and identification of previously tagged trees.

- Buttressed trees and measurement change protocols
  - Special guidelines for irregular stems, buttress growth, and POM changes to ensure unbiased growth estimates; documented in a field-change guide with decision rules and documentation.

- Mortality, recruitment, and data quality
  - Clear codes for alive/dead status, mode of death, and mortality processes; recruits are marked distinctly and monitored for subsequent tagging.
  - Emphasis on cross-checks, recensus procedures, and documentation of potential errors; differences between current and historical measurements are reviewed to avoid erroneous conclusions.

- Data processing, management, and sharing
  - Field data are uploaded to ForestPlots.net; post-field quality control is applied to handle unlikely recruits, missing census data, and abnormal growth.
  - Data are organized as one Excel file per plot with three worksheets (trees, lianas, site details); standard fields and codes ensure consistency across plots and researchers.

- Optical diameter correction and measurement accuracy
  - Optical diameter measurements underestimate true diameter; a correction formula reduces bias (approximate 0.5% error on average); measurements should be taken from multiple angles when using optical methods.

- Appendices: coding and methodological keys
  - Detailed coding schemes for alive status (FLAG 1), mode of death (FLAG 2), measurement technique (FLAG 3), post-field data management (FLAG 4), height measurement technique (FLAG 5).
  - Specialized keys for lianas and main-host status, with guidance on mortality events, host relationships, and measurement variations.
  - Additional notes provide guidance on interpreting and applying the codes, and illustrative references for the methods.
