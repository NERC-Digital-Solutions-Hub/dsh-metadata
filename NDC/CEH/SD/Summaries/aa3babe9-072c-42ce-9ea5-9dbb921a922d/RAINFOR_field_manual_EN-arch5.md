# RAINFOR Field Manual for Plot Establishment and Remeasurement

## Aim and Scope
- Establish and remeasure long-term permanent plots across the Amazon to monitor biomass, dynamics, soil and climate relationships.
- Standardize methodologies to enable robust cross-site comparisons and tracking of methodological changes over time.
- Encourage discussion of protocols to reduce inter-site differences and biases.

## Overview of the RAINFOR Program
- Brazilian/Peruvian/Ecuadorian field networks; long-term PSPs (permanent sample plots) to study biomass, productivity, mortality, and biodiversity.
- Objectives include quantifying long-term biomass turnover, relating structure/physiology to climate and soils, understanding productivity–mortality–biomass relationships, and informing basin-scale carbon models.
- Emphasizes standardization of forest inventory protocols and documentation of methodological changes.

## Plot Location and Design (A–I)
- Pan-Amazon strategy: sample across edaphic/climatic variation; new plots randomly placed within well-defined strata.
- Plot criteria: homogeneous soil parent material, good access, long-term security, institutional support, and minimal anthropogenic disturbance unless explicitly studied.
- Positioning: plots within strata should be randomly located to avoid bias; random start points and directions when available.
- Timing: measure plots over whole-year intervals; time measurements to minimize interannual soil water variation; wet-season timing preferred in El Niño regions.
- Orientation and Bearings: record main axis bearings, latitude, longitude, elevation; note true vs magnetic north.
- Shape and Size: prefer 1 ha plots for adequate sampling; subplots of 20 x 20 m; both square and rectangular shapes used; plan to maintain edge-area consistency.
- Topography: include external/internal boundaries with 20 m segmentation; apply slope corrections where necessary (d = 20 / cos(θ)).
- Visibility and Markers: use inconspicuous permanent markers; ensure relocatability with clear edge marking.
- Plot Stringing: four-person approach (compass, line cutter, distance measurer, string layer) for accurate delimitation; minimize cutting to reduce disturbance.

## Tagging, Measurement, and Data Capture (J–M)
- Tagging: tag trees systematically around subplots; standard tag height (1.60 m or 30 cm below POM if using 1.6 m tagging); use nails; ensure consistent sides for longitudinal tracking.
- Tree Measurement: measure at 1.3 m POM where possible; alternative POM documented; record POM height if different; handle special cases (buttresses, deformities, fluted stems, slopes, leaning trees) with predefined rules.
- Lianas: record liana stems >10 cm diameter; measure at three key points (d1.3length, d1.3height, dmax); tag and map to host trees when applicable; resolve ambiguities in liana stem boundaries with explicit notes.
- Data Recording: standardized data entries for trees and lianas, including subplot, coordinates, tag, species, diameters, POM, measurement method (ladder, Relascope, camera), and notes on conditions (leaning, buttress, etc.).
- Subplot and Site Recording: sketches, slope details, soil texture and drainage; plot latitude/longitude, elevation, boundary bearings; notes on rooting depth for fallen trees.

## Measurements and Methods (N–O)
- Tree Measurements: document height of POM, camera height, compass bearing to tree, horizontal distance, scale length, photo number; include multi-stem and buttress records; use chalk/paint to mark POM.
- Liana Measurements: three-point diameter scheme; determine whether stems are independent apparents; record host associations; tag every >10 cm dmax stem; document liana-host interactions.
- Height and Wood Density: collect heights for a subset of trees to calibrate height–diameter relationships; sample branch wood density for stand-level biomass accuracy.
- Optical Measurements: acknowledge systematic underestimation in optical diameter measurements; apply a correction formula; typical error ~0.5% of measured diameter, size-dependent.

## Botanical Collections and Temporal Planning (P–Q)
- Botanical Collections: collect morphospecies not identifiable in the field; press and curate vouchers; record collectors and voucher numbers.
- For 1-hectare new plots: recommended team composition and ~48 person-days, plus time for rain delays and logistics; relocation and recensus workflows outlined for existing plots (~13 person-days).

## Data Management, Processing, and QC (G–H)
- Data Upload: field data are uploaded to ForestPlots.net; follow post-field data handling and QC protocols; preserve original measurements, notes on presumed errors, and corrections to maintain auditability.
- Data Organization: one Excel file per plot with three worksheets (trees, lianas, site details); each row represents a stem; separate sheets for Relaskop/digital camera measurements; include field data notes and data manipulation notes.
- QC and Corrections: document any corrections or interpolations; maintain an auditable trail of changes; use database features to log data manipulations.
- Post-Field Data Management Flags: standardized codes (Flag 4) for retrospective data handling, including extrapolations, corrections, interpolations, and POM changes.
- Data Processing Guidance: follow ForestPlots.net protocols for uploading, and apply the quality control procedures to address issues such as unlikely recruits, missing census data, and abnormal growth.

## Measurement Technique and Flags (Appendices)
- Flag 1: Alive status for trees and lianas (multiple codes allowed; combinations avoided for certain codes); indicates health and structural status.
- Flag 2: Mode of death (physical mechanism, number of trees involved in mortality event, killer process).
- Flag 3: Measurement technique (tape, Relascope, digital camera, ladder, dendrometer, etc.).
- Flag 4: Post-field data management (retrospective modifications like extrapolation, interpolation, correction types).
- Flag 5: Height measurement technique (eye estimate, trigonometry, laser hypsometer, etc.). Only one measurement technique per tree, with caveats for POM changes.
- Appendices provide detailed categorization for death modes, liana interactions, crown lighting/illumination, and host relationships.

## Data Integration and Accessibility
- Central data repository: ForestPlots.net; standardized data exchange and revision control.
- Emphasis on consistent metadata, field protocols, and documentation to facilitate cross-site synthesis and longitudinal analyses.
- Encourages propagation of methodological refinements but requires clear versioning and notes for traceability.
