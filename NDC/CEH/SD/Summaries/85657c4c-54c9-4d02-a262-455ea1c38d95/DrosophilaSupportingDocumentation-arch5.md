# Drosophila–parasitoid interactions in the Australian Wet Tropics: dataset description

## Overview
- Primary data describing observed interactions between Drosophila species (vinegar flies) and hymenopteran parasitoids across two elevation transects in the Australian Wet Tropics.
- Each row in the core data represents a single Drosophila pupae screened for parasitoids; subset identifications of Drosophila species and parasitoids obtained via DNA metabarcoding (with a hierarchical sampling scheme).
- Supplementary data include environmental recordings (temperature and humidity) and genome sequences used for host identification.
- Data were generated by Chris Jeffs (field work), sequenced in the Jan Hrček lab, with data curation and analysis by Chris Terry.

## Study sites and sampling design
- Location: Australian Wet Tropics World Heritage area, northeastern Queensland, Australia.
- Elevation transects: Paluma Range Road (Paluma) and Kirrama Range Road (Kirrama).
- Elevation range: 59–916 m above sea level.
- Sites: 7 sites per transect (14 total) arranged along elevation gradients.
- GPS coordinates and site codes (e.g., K070, K150, …, P880) are provided for each site.
- Sampling period: traps deployed during 11 March – 12 April 2016 (mid-late wet season).

## Field collection methods
- Sampling instrument: bottle traps baited with fermented banana (banana bait with baker’s yeast).
- Trap design: 1.5 L bottles with two side windows for entry; rain-shielded lid; ant-exclusion applied with Tanglefoot.
- Deployment: traps hung ~1.5 m above ground, spaced at least 5 m apart, at least 5 m from roads to minimize sun effects.
- Trap exposure: long (24 days), medium (14–15 days), or short (11–12 days); one site excluded from short exposure due to weather.
- Sample processing: for each site, pupae were sorted from 15 randomly selected traps (5 traps per exposure category); traps with ants, extreme dryness, or flooding were excluded.
- Storage: collected pupae stored individually in 96-well plates with 100% ethanol at −15°C.

## Data structure and content
- PupaeIdentification.csv
  - Rows: one pupae per row.
  - Key columns: SampleID, Transect, Site (elevation), ExposureLength (Short/Medium/Long), TrapID, Host (Drosophila species; NA if unknown), Parasitoid (pseudo-species), Parasitised (TRUE/FALSE), Group (Screen Only; Core; Enriching).
- Environmental Data
  - DataLoggerRecords.csv: hourly readings from data loggers (temperature and relative humidity) at each site/trap; columns include Date, Temp, Humidity, SerialNumber, Site, Trap, Transect.
  - Notes: data completeness varied by site (e.g., Kirrama sites with limited usable data; Paluma 070m set up later).
- SequencesTable.csv
  - Details of sequences used to identify Drosophila species.
  - Columns include Species, Location, Sample Code, Locus, Year of collection, GenBank accession number, Seq.

## Hierarchical network construction and data processing
- Core network
  - A random core: 182 pupae per site with full identification of host and parasitoid (when present) via DNA metabarcoding.
  - Outcomes: 722 hosts identified (per site 86–138 samples); 179 parasitized; 147 parasitoids identified.
- Enrichment network
  - Additional samples (total 2,659; 339–564 per site) screened for parasitoid DNA via PCR.
  - Parasitized samples sequenced to identify host and parasitoid.
- Network integration
  - The overall enriched quantitative network combines core network data (host frequencies and host-specific parasitism rates) with interaction data from the enriching set to derive interaction frequencies.

## Sequencing and taxonomic identification
- DNA metabarcoding used to identify host (Drosophila) and parasitoid species for core network.
- PCR screening applied to enrichment samples to detect parasitism; positive samples sequenced to determine parasitoid identity.
- SequencesTable.csv provides the mapping of sequences to species, loci, collection year, and GenBank accession numbers.

## Permits and attribution
- Permits: WITK16977516 from the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection for Chris Jeffs.

## Data quality, limitations, and governance
- Metadata and data quality
  - Comprehensive metadata accompany each data file (SampleID, Transect, Site, ExposureLength, TrapID, Host, Parasitoid, Parasitised, Group).
  - Some entries include NA for Host when identification did not proceed; certain traps excluded due to ants, dryness, or flooding.
  - Environmental data supported by hourly records, with site-specific data completeness limitations noted.
- Limitations and scope
  - Partial identifications: not all pupae were identified to species; core network provides higher-confidence identifications for a substantial subset.
  - Temporal and spatial scope: data cover two elevation transects within a single sampling window (2016); may limit generalizability to other times/locations.
  - Data formats and interoperability: data are provided as CSVs with descriptive fields and a hierarchical network approach; integration with other systems may require careful mapping of fields (e.g., Host, Parasitoid, Parasitised, Group).
- Data stewardship considerations
  - Clear data provenance: connections among field sampling, metabarcoding, PCR screening, and sequencing are documented.
  - Data upkeep: future updates would require maintaining consistent SampleIDs across CSVs and linking to sequence metadata (SequencesTable.csv) and GenBank records.
  - Reuse guidance: dataset complemented by the associated paper (Jeffs et al. 2020 preprint) and supplementary materials; appropriate citation and adherence to data-use notes are advised.

## Access and use for data stewards
- Data discovery and cataloging
  - Structured metadata enables discovery by researchers interested in host–parasitoid networks, metabarcoding data, and ecological network analysis.
  - Distinct data components (PupaeIdentification.csv, DataLoggerRecords.csv, SequencesTable.csv) support modular reuse (e.g., combining interaction data with environmental context or sequence-based identifications).
- Data quality management
  - Maintain traceability between sampling events, laboratory workflows (metabarcoding, PCR), and final identifications.
  - Track missing data and exclusion criteria to preserve transparency in analyses and enrichments.
- Interoperability and standards
  - Metadata fields align with typical ecological datasets (location, transect, site, exposure, host, parasitoid, parasitised).
  - Ensure consistent naming and linking across files (SampleID as a key: connect PupaeIdentification.csv with environmental data and sequence records).
- Governance and updates
  - Document any future updates to identifications or methods; provide versioning to preserve reproducibility.
  - Link to GenBank accessions and sequence data in SequencesTable.csv for traceable provenance.
