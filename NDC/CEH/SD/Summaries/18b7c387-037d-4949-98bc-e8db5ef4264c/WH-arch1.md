# WH Protocol

- Aim: To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

- Rationale: Samples deteriorate after collection due to chemical and microbiological processes; use filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations) acidification to slow deterioration. Requires laboratory training, experience, and health and safety compliance.

- Initial storage: Store in cold storage at 1–4°C if more than seven hours elapse before measurement; return to cold storage if filtering is not completed on the same day; if sending to another site, ship on the collection day with cool boxes and pre-frozen blocks.

- Conductivity measurement:
  - Within 36 hours of collection, on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
  - Use the HMSO (1978) method; express results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.

- pH measurement:
  - Within 36 hours of collection, on an unfiltered subsample (same subsample as conductivity; conductivity measured first and the subsample not returned to the main sample).
  - Use HMSO (1988) method with separate glass and reference electrodes; express results to 0.01 pH unit.

- Filtering:
  - Must occur within 60 hours of collection; follow Appendix I procedures.
  - Record filtering details using unique sample codes.
  - Post-filter analysis: dissolved Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH4⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO3⁻-N, SO4²⁻, PO4³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; optional for precipitation water).
  - If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, priority is given to key measurements.
  - If volume >100 ml, transfer a 20 ml subsample for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.

- Storage prior to chemical analysis:
  - Store at 1–4°C; analysis ideally within 16 days of collection, but no later than 28 days.
  - If sending to another location, minimize time out of cold storage; use next-day delivery and avoid Friday dispatch.

- Washing bottles (Appendix II):
  - Containers washed with phosphate- and hypochlorite-free cleaning agent; Decomatic or Decon-90 options; rinse steps outlined; store dried and recapped for reuse with the same sampler.

- Appendix I: Filtering (equipment and procedure):
  - Equipment: filter funnel assembly, membrane filters (Whatman WCN, 0.45 μm), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar), all contact surfaces rinsed with deionised/distilled water; filters used once.
  - Pre-filtration: For soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ), pre-filter may be needed; rinse filters with 250 ml distilled water before use.
  - Handling: Do not touch filters or contact surfaces with hands; use forceps; pour filtered water into a clean dry bottle and do not return to the unfiltered bottle.
  - Subsampling: If >100 ml volume, take a 20 ml subsample for Al/Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
  - Labeling: Sample containers must include ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler code; this reference must appear with final data submitted to the ECN database.
  - Suppliers: Lists for ECN protocol and equipment suppliers (e.g., BDH, Millipore) provided.

- Appendix II: Bottle and vial washing:
  - Cleaning agent must be phosphate- and hypochlorite-free.
  - Cleaning options include Decon or Decomatic; if no machine, soak in Decon-90.
  - Rinse protocol: four taps with tap water, three with deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse and air-dry, then recapped.
