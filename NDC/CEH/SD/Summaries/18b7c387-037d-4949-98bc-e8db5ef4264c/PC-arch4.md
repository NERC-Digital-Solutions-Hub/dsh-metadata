# PC Protocol

- Aim
  - Measure the chemical composition of precipitation and dry deposition (bulk precipitation) at ECN sites using a continuously open bulk deposition gauge.
  - Justification: historic interest in acid rain and its ecosystem impacts; future emissions changes may affect deposition; bulk deposition provides integrated input data for ecological and atmospheric studies.
  - Scope: deposition has wet and dry components; use of bulk collector yields integrated data (with trade-offs for separating sources).

- Background and Rationale
  - Links to UK monitoring networks to enable regional comparability (UKPCMN).

- Equipment and Method
  - Bulk collector design: conical polythene funnel on a polythene bottle; two funnel sizes (typically 152 mm diameter); collector height ~1.75 m above ground; 1 mm mesh Teflon filter to remove debris; steel jacket to protect sample and maintain cooler conditions; bird deterrents may be supplemented by decoys.
  - Field considerations: place away from contamination sources; open, unobstructed location; near soil solution samplers and weather station when possible; secure to ground or structure.
  - Sample collection frequency and handling: weekly bottle changes on a fixed schedule (ECN standard: Wednesdays at 0900 GMT); replace bottle with clean bottle and filter; handle ice/snow samples without pre-cleaning; transport to laboratory for analysis.

- Location and Site Setup
  - Avoid proximity to dusty tracks, animal houses, or tall obstructions; select an open site near key instruments; ensure minimal vegetation trampling and soil compaction during visits.
  - Collector must be anchored (bolted or guyed).

- Sampling Procedure (Appendix I)
  - Required items: clean sample bottle with code, DW wash bottle, forceps, two clean funnels, two clean funnels filters, spare cap, field recording form, pencil, and bags.
  - Field recording: note contamination indicators (dust, insects, bird droppings, fires, dust sources) using codes or text.
  - Bottling steps: detach funnel assembly, transfer sample bottle, replace filter insert, wash or replace funnel as needed, ensure funnel is horizontal and cap is tightly fastened to prevent leakage.

- Laboratory Handling
  - Volume determination: measure precipitation volume to the nearest 1 ml by weighing bottle contents.
  - pH and conductivity: measure on unfiltered water per ECN Water Handling protocol.
  - Filtration and chemical analysis: after filtering, analyze dissolved ions and alkalinity:
    - Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4- P, and alkalinity.
  - Volume accuracy: use volume from nearby weather station or standard rainguage for flux calculations (bulk collector volume may be less accurate after snow events).

- Labeling and Metadata (Recording Conventions)
  - Unique sample identification must include:
    - ECN Measurement Code (PC)
    - ECN Site ID (e.g., 04 Moor House)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date (e.g., 01-Jan-1996)
  - The recording form captures factors affecting chemistry (insects, dust, bird droppings) and local disturbances (fires, dust sources).
  - Data must accompany results when transferred to the ECN database.

- Quality Assurance (QA)
  - QA procedures follow Acid Deposition Monitoring Network standards (error assessment during sampling, handling, and analysis).
  - References: standard QA practices and network protocols (e.g., Hall 1986; Heyes et al. 1985; Last & Watling 1991; Smith 1872; Devenish 1986; Review Group on Acid Rain 1990).

- Data Output and Recording Conventions (Core Measurement: PC Protocol)
  - Core measurement variables recorded weekly (for each site, core and location):
    - Setting out date and time (GMT 24-h clock; time to 1-minute precision)
    - Sampling time
    - Volume (ml)
    - pH (units on pH scale; precision 0.1)
    - Conductivity (µS cm-1; precision 0.1)
    - Alkalinity (+) (mg L-1; precision 3 significant figures)
    - Na+ (mg L-1; 3 sig figs)
    - Ca2+, Mg2+ (mg L-1; 3 sig figs)
    - Fe2+ (mg L-1; 3 sig figs)
    - Al3+ (mg L-1; 3 sig figs)
    - Cl- (mg L-1; 3 sig figs)
    - NO3--N (mg L-1; 3 sig figs)
    - SO4--S (mg L-1; 3 sig figs)
    - PO4- P (mg L-1; 3 sig figs)
  - Data submission: ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation provides dataset formats; access via restricted extranet (Site Managers' exnet). For access, contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.

- Data Governance and Access
  - Data are structured by site, core measurement, location, and sampling date/time; dataset conventions align with ECNCCU requirements.
  - Data management includes unique identifiers, field contamination indicators, and alignment with UK and ECN datasets for cross-site comparability.

  - Appendix I: Routine sample collection (step-by-step field procedures and contingency for contamination; detailed steps 1–11).
  - Appendix II: Equipment details (complete assembly components; spare parts; recommended number of funnel assemblies per site; supplier information).

- Note
  - Record the date/time the bottle was last emptied and set out.
