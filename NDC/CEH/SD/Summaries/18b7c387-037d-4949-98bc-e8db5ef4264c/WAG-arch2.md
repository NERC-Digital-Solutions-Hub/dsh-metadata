# WAG Protocol

## Aim
- Provide analytical guidelines for water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
- Laboratories manage their own resources under controlled conditions.
- Require documentation of methodologies, significant changes, and validation procedures.
- Annual review by an Analytical Working Group.
- Establish approved techniques, with detection limits as targets.

## Responsibilities and scope
- Each laboratory bears responsibility for methods and quality control.
- Laboratories must document methods, changes, and validation.
- Methods will evolve; reference techniques are maintained for comparison.
- Ensure data are comparable across sites and time.

## Approved techniques and reference techniques
- Determinand coverage includes: pH, conductivity, major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+), anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, Cl-), NH4-N, alkalinity, DOC, total N, Fe, Al, and others.
- Typical methods used: FES/AAS, IC, colormetric/indophenol methods, and related approved approaches.
- Reference techniques provide a basis for comparison as technologies evolve (with HMSO references for pH, conductivity, alkalinity, etc.).
- Notes emphasize reporting specific fractions (e.g., NO3-, SO4 2-, etc.) and monitoring alternative techniques for bias to ensure comparability.

## Data handling, methodology records, and metadata
- Laboratories keep detailed method records locally; ECN database stores summary metadata for each determinand, site, date, and method.
- Examples illustrate recording: substance, matrix, typical concentrations, calibration range, detection limits, accuracy measures, and interferences.
- Changes to methods trigger new database records with date stamps to maintain traceability.

## Validation, accuracy, and precision
- Validation relies on approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC; participation in interlaboratory checks (e.g., AQUACHECK) is essential.
- Accuracy: closeness to true value and agreement across labs; documented via control samples and corrective actions if needed.
- Precision: assessed with QC samples; batch bias monitored; results and QC status reported to site managers.

## Quality control (QC) procedures
- A separate ECN QC system uses synthetic QC solutions to assess batch performance and detect trends or rogue batches.
- Two concentrated QC solutions (one for cations, one for anions) prepared annually; distributed to sites for use in the following year.
- QC data submitted to the ECN database in the same dataset as samples, with specific fields for preparation dates, measurement dates, results, and quality codes.

## Data transfer and QC data format
- QC data are transmitted in a machine-readable, comma-separated format, aligned with sample data fields.
- Includes measurement codes, site IDs, preparation dates, measurement dates, pH (unabridged and stirred), conductivity, alkalinity, major ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, PO4-P, NO3-N, NH4-N, Cl, SO4-S), DOC, Total N, plus a quality code.
- Example records and field definitions provided to ensure consistency and traceability.

## Priority listing of determinands
- In low-sample-volume periods, a working priority guides analytical options:
  - 1. pH and conductivity
  - 2. Anions: NO3-, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, Cl-
  - 3. Cations: Ca2+, Mg2+, then K+, Na+
  - 4. NH4+-N
  - 6. Fe2+, Al3+ (requires separate acidified portion)
  - 5. DOC
  - 7. Total N and alkalinity
- Refer to the Initial Water Handling Protocol for sample handling, filtration, pH, and acidification guidance.

## Documentation and change management
- Method details stay with the laboratory; ECN maintains a meta-database entry per determinand/site/date.
- Changes to methods or procedures are recorded with a date stamp to preserve data suitability for the study.

## Example of accuracy record
- Demonstrates recording of accuracy checks (e.g., SO4 2- via ion chromatography) with comparisons to reference schemes (AQUACHECK) and any corrective actions if needed.

## End note
- The protocol emphasizes standardized methods, traceable data, interlaboratory QA, and data accessibility to maximise the value and comparability of environmental monitoring datasets.
