ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

## Aim
- Provide guidelines for analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
- Laboratories must analyze under controlled conditions and document methodology, significant changes, and validation procedures.
- Annual review by Analytical Working Group.
- Establish target detection limits and appropriate methods for each determinand.

## Approved and reference techniques
- Determinands include pH, conductivity, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, NH4-N, Cl-, NO3-, SO4^2-, HCO3-, PO4^3-, DOC, Total N.
- For each determinand, alternative approved techniques are listed; notes indicate when techniques quantify related fractions or require comparative tests.
- Reference techniques (primary methods) are defined to aid comparison and assessment of new methodologies; e.g., pH and conductivity referenced to HMSO blue books and IC/AAS methods for ions.
- Measurements often report species of interest, with explicit reference technique and ultimate detection limit per determinand.

## Priority listing of determinands
- In periods of low rainfall or limited sample volume, a priority order guides handling and analytical options:
  1) pH, conductivity
  3) Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ first; then K+, Na+)
  2) Anions (NO3-, SO4^2-, then PO4^3-, Cl-)
  4) NH4-N
  6) Cations requiring separate acidified portion (Fe2+, Al3+)
  5) DOC
  7) Total N, alkalinity

## Providing details of methodology
- Labs keep detailed methods for operators; ECN database stores a single data record per determinand per site to indicate methodology and precision.
- Data records include substance determined, measurement basis, sample types, typical concentrations, calibration, accuracy/precision notes, and measurement results.
- Example structure provided (nitrate, ion chromatography) with fields for site, determinand, sample types, calibration range, detection limits, and QC notes.

## Validation and quality
- Validation via approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal quality control; interlaboratory analysis (e.g., AQUACHECK) encouraged.
- Accuracy: closeness to true value; quantify via participation in control schemes, with records of accuracy checks and any corrections applied.
- Precision: use synthetic QC solutions; report QC data with results; monitor for batch bias; include potential site-correction factors; detect rogue batches and trends over time.
- Separate quality control system for ECN participants to validate batches; use two concentrated QC solutions (cation and anion) prepared at Merlewood; annual continuity checks between old/new QC solutions.

## Data transfer and QC data format
- QC data must be submitted to the ECN CCU in a machine-readable format alongside sample data.
- Batch-level QC data record includes fields such as measurement code (QC), site ID, QC sample code, preparation dates, analysis completion dates, results for pH, Conductivity, alkalinity, major ions, DOC, Total N, etc., and a quality code.
- The format is free-format, comma-separated, with a defined sequence of variables (dates, results, units, precision) and a quality code suffix when needed.
- Example QC record provided (Moor House), illustrating date fields and multiple determinands.

## Data management and reporting
- Laboratories should store method details locally and provide summary information to the ECN database.
- Data records link by site, core measurement, determinand, and date to indicate methodology and precision.
- Method changes trigger a new database record stamped with the change date to maintain traceability.

## Notes on measurement handling and bias
- For pH and conductivity, refer to Initial Water Handling Protocol for handling specifics.
- For pH in low ionic strength waters, use methods capable of quantifying low ionic strength solutions with appropriate reference electrodes.
- When reporting data, labs should specify the fraction measured (e.g., SO4^2- as S) and monitor alternative techniques if a bias is suspected.

## Change management
- Any changes in methodology or details require creating a new dated record in the ECN database to maintain an auditable history.
