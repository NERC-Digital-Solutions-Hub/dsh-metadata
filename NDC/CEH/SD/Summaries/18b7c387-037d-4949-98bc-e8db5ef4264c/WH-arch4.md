# WH Protocol

## Aim
- To measure conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water, and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Samples deteriorate after collection due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Deterioration is slowed by: filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe) acidification.
- Protocol requires laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background and quality control are covered in related documents.

## Data lifecycle and timeliness

- Initial storage
  - If measurement will occur more than seven hours after collection: store at 1–4°C.
  - If filtering is not completed the same day, keep in cold storage and return to cold storage as needed.
  - If samples are sent to another site for initial handling, ship the day of collection by fastest method.
  - In-transit samples should be kept in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

- Conductivity measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
  - Report results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm⁻¹).

- pH measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample (conductivity measured first; do not return subsample to main bottle).
  - Use the specified glass/references electrodes; report to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

- Filtering
  - Complete within 60 hours of collection.
  - Follow Appendix I procedures; record filtering details using unique sample codes.
  - Analyze for determinands: Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, NH4-N, Cl, NO3-N, SO4, PO4, alkalinity, and DOC (DOC optional for precipitation water).
  - If sample volume is limited, follow the priority order for determinands.

- Storage prior to chemical analysis
  - Store at 1–4°C.
  - Analyze preferably within 16 days of collection, but no later than 28 days.
  - If samples are sent elsewhere, minimize the time out of cold storage.

## Data capture and metadata

- Use a unique reference for each sample and successively submit data to the ECN database.
- Required identifiers to place on each sample:
  - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
  - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date
  - Additional sampler code as needed
- These identifiers support traceability from collection through analysis to data submission.

## Data quality and handling

- Filtration and analysis steps must be documented in detail; order of priority for determinands is provided when sample volume is insufficient.
- Acidification is only for Al and Fe determinations.
- Follow defined methods (e.g., conductivity and pH measurement references) to maintain consistency and comparability.

## Data storage, transport, and governance

- Ensure next-day delivery for samples under storage and transport constraints to minimize deterioration.
- Document all sample transfers and keep samples in appropriate cold storage during transit.

## Filtration procedures and determinands (Appendix I highlights)

- Equipment
  - Filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil)
  - Membrane filters (Whatman WCN 0.45 µm)
  - Glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C)
  - Vacuum pump (≈0.5 bar vacuum)
- Handling
  - Rinse all filtering components with deionized/distilled water before first use and between samples.
  - Do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; use each filter for one sample.
  - For soil solution and river water, pre-filtering may be required with a glass fibre filter (wash with 250 mL distilled water before use).
  - For volumes >100 mL, transfer a 20 mL subsample to a vial for Al/Fe and acidify with 20 µL HCl.
- Labeling and traceability
  - Label containers with ECN codes and sampler information to ensure data traceability in the ECN database.

## Bottles and vial washing (Appendix II highlights)

- Cleaning agents
  - Use phosphate- and hypochlorite-free cleaning agents.
- Decontamination products
  - Preferred: Decon-like products (e.g., Decon-90) or equivalent where machines are unavailable.
- Washing process
  - Rinse 4 times with tap water then 3 times with deionized/distilled water after first use.
  - If used again, rinse 3 times with distilled water and recap immediately.
- Drying and storage
  - Shake to remove droplets, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, and recap.
- Sourcing
  - Cleaning agents and Decon products available from listed suppliers (BDH, Millipore).

## Compliance and safety

- The protocol notes that laboratory training and health and safety compliance are required for handling acids and concentrated reagents.
- Guidance and help from chemists may be necessary for analyses and determinations.
