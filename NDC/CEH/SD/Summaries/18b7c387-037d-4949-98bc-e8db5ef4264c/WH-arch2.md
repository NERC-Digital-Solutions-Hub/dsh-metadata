# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- To slow deterioration: filtration, cold storage, and, for Al and Fe determinations only, acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background and quality control procedures are provided in related documents.

## Key requirements

### Initial storage
- Store cold at 1–4°C if the interval to conductivity/pH measurement exceeds seven hours; return to cold storage if not filtered the same day.
- If samples are sent to another site for initial handling, send on the collection day by the fastest method.
- In transit, keep in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

### Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Express results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.

### pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; use separate glass and reference electrodes, with conductivity measured first.
- Express results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

### Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I methods.
- Record filtering details with unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyse for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH4⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO3⁻-N, SO4²⁻, PO4³⁻, alkalinity, and DOC (DOC optional for precipitation water unless needed).
- If sample volume is insufficient, determine a priority order for determinands.

### Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1–4°C.
- Preferably analyse within 16 days of collection, but within 28 days max.
- If sending to another location, minimise the time out of cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery, no Friday dispatch).

### Documentation and unique reference
- Use unique sample codes and label containers with:
  - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
  - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date
  - Additional sampler code if needed (e.g., SS sampler code)

## Procedures and Equipment (Appendix I: Filtering)

- Filter funnel assembly: modern assemblies (e.g., Millipore Sterifil) with 0.45 µm membrane filters (Whatman WCN) and glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C).
- Vacuum pump capable of ~0.5 bar vacuum.
- Handling rules: rinse all filter assembly parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples; do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; single-use filters per sample.
- Pre-filtering: soils (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtering through a glass fibre filter; rinse filters with 250 mL distilled water before use.
- Subsampling: for samples >100 mL, transfer 20 mL to a vial for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µL HCl.
- Container labeling: ensure each sample is tagged with the same unique codes noted above.

## Bottle and vial washing (Appendix II)

- Wash containers with a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Preferred cleaners: Deconamic (Decomatic) or Decon-90 for overnight soaking if no machine available.
- Rinse sequence: four rinses with tap water, three with deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times with distilled water and reuse with the same sampler if appropriate.
- After washing: shake to remove drops, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, recap immediately.
