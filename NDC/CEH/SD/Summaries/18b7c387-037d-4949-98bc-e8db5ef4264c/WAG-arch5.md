# ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

- Purpose and scope
  - Laboratories are responsible for controlling analytical resources and must document methodology, significant changes, and validation procedures.
  - An Analytical Working Group conducts annual reviews to update procedures and methods.
  - Detection limits serve as targets; methods may be updated as technology evolves.

- Approved techniques and comparability
  - A defined set of determinands with approved techniques (e.g., pH, conductivity, major cations/anions, NH4-N, NO3-N, Cl, SO4, PO4, DOC, Total N).
  - Alternative methods are allowed but must be documented; laboratories should monitor for bias if different methods are used.
  - For each determinand, reference techniques are provided to enable consistent comparison across sites.

- Data provenance, metadata, and governance
  - Details of analytical methods are retained at the laboratory; summary information is stored in the ECN database.
  - Data records are created per determinand per ECN site to indicate methodology, precision, and measurement context.
  - When methodology changes, a new dated record is added to preserve traceability.

- Validation, accuracy, and precision
  - Validation relies on approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC; interlaboratory analysis (e.g., AQUACHECK) is used to assess accuracy.
  - Accuracy measures how closely results align with true values and community consensus; results and corrective procedures are documented.
  - Precision is controlled via QC samples and trend detection; synthetic QC solutions are used to monitor batch bias and enable detection of rogue batches over time.

- Data handling, reporting, and transfer
  - Data must be reported with the specified fraction and units; consistency is required to avoid bias when alternative techniques are used.
  - A detailed data transfer schema exists for ECN reporting (including a comprehensive, comma-separated, free-format data record). This includes fields for site, determinand, date, method, calibration, and QC metrics.
  - QC data for each batch is submitted to the ECN Central Custody Unit in a standardized format, allowing linkage between sample results and QA data.

- Quality control program
  - Separate QC system with two concentrated QC solutions (one for cations, one for anions) is distributed annually; solutions are prepared by analysts prior to analysis.
  - QC results are used to assess batch performance and are submitted alongside sample data.
  - A continuity check is performed by re-analyzing prior-year QC solutions with new solutions.

- Priority handling under limited sample volumes
  - A priority list guides analytical options when sample volumes are scarce (pH and conductivity highest priority; major cations/anions next; then NH4-N, DOC, Total N, alkalinity, etc.).
  - Emphasizes the need to follow Initial Water Handling Protocols for sample processing, filtration, and acidification when volumes are constrained.

- Documentation, traceability, and change management
  - Laboratories must maintain records of methodology, instrument maintenance, calibration, drift, and staff training.
  - Changes to methods are captured with date stamps to ensure traceability and assessment of data suitability.

- Example data records and governance artifacts
  - Meta-data and example data records illustrate how methodology, site, determinand, and measurement context are linked in the ECN database.
  - Example accuracy records demonstrate how interlaboratory comparisons are used to verify data quality.
