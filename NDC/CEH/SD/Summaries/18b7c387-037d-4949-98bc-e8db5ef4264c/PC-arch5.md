# PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY Version 1.1 (supplier contact details updated July 2005)

## Aim
- Measure the chemical composition of precipitation and dry deposition (bulk deposition) at ECN sites using a continuously open bulk collector.
- Support understanding of atmospheric deposition impacts on ecosystems and enable linking ECN data with UK Precipitation Composition Monitoring Networks.
- Provide data on wet and dry deposition (with dry deposition calculable from concentrations and deposition velocities or differences between open- and precipitation-only collectors).

## Data governance, metadata and data flow
- Data are identified and traceable through unique sample identifiers and site/location metadata, enabling linkage through the ECN database.
- Core data are captured and stored with standardized fields; dataset formats and transfer specifications are available in the restricted ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation.
- QA procedures are in place to assess errors introduced during sampling, handling, and analysis, ensuring data quality for sharing and long-term use.

## Equipment, location, and sampling setup
- Bulk collector design: conical polythene funnel on a bottle with a 1 mm mesh Teflon filter; jacketed with a steel outer to keep samples dark and cool; mounted about 1.75 m above ground.
- Site setup: place upwind of contamination sources; avoid dusty tracks and animal housings; secure collector to a concrete base or with guy ropes; maintain separation from other instruments where possible.
- Equipment considerations: two funnel sizes (primarily 152 mm); three funnel/bottle/filter assemblies recommended per site; bird deterrents may be used.

## Sampling procedure and timing
- Sampling is weekly, typically on Wednesdays at 0900 GMT; change the collection bottle and filter, or replace the funnel if needed.
- Sampling involves transferring fresh precipitation into a clean bottle with a clean filter, preventing contamination during bottle changes.
- If snow/ice is present, transfer to the new bottle without cleaning the ice/snow; allow it to melt into the sample.
- Volume determination: weigh the bottle with contents (cap removed) to determine precipitation volume to the nearest millilitre.
- Transport and storage: samples are returned to the laboratory for analysis; volumes and times are recorded to align with local weather station data for flux calculations if necessary.

## Labelling, recording and provenance
- Each sample is uniquely identified by:
  - ECN Measurement Code (PC)
  - ECN Site ID (e.g., 04 for Moor House)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date (e.g., 01-Jan-1996)
- Recording forms capture factors affecting chemistry (e.g., insects, dust, bird droppings) and local disturbances (fires, dust sources).
- All labeling and recording information must accompany results through every analysis stage and into the ECN database.

## Analysis, variables and units
- After filtration, analyze unfiltered water for baseline measurements; then filter for chemical analysis.
- Measured and recorded core variables (weekly):
  - Volume (ml) and Sampling time (GMT)
  - pH (units on the pH scale)
  - Conductivity (µS cm-1)
  - Alkalinity (mg L-1 as CaCO3)
  - Major ions: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4-S, PO4- P
- Data are recorded with specified precision (e.g., 3 significant figures for ion concentrations) and associated timestamps.

## Data handling, processing and QA
- Handling and analysis follow the ECN Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol; specify whether samples are filtered before analysis.
- QA assesses potential errors from sampling, handling, and laboratory analysis to ensure data reliability for public sharing and long-term use.
- Data should reflect any limitations (e.g., volume accuracy, contamination indicators) via the field recording forms.

## Data transfer and portal submission
- Data for ECN sites are prepared for transfer to the ECNCCU and must conform to the ECN dataset formats described in the restricted extranet documentation.
- Submitters must ensure that core identifiers (Site, Location, Measurement Code) and Sampling Date/time are present and correctly formatted to enable dataset integration and discovery.

## Appendices and equipment details (summary)
- Appendix I: Routine sample collection—step-by-step field procedures, including bottle changes, funnel handling, cleaning guidelines, and contamination precautions.
- Appendix II: Equipment details—recommended complete assembly, spare parts, and supplier information; guidance on funnel sizes and site provisioning.
- Supplier information and model specifications provided to ensure consistent equipment across ECN sites.

## Practical considerations for data stewards
- Ensure consistent use of core identifiers (Site ID, Location Code, Measurement Code, Sampling Date) across all records.
- Enforce adherence to weekly sampling schedule and standardized labeling to maintain dataset interoperability.
- Maintain documentation of field disturbances and QA outcomes to support data quality assessments and traceability.
- Coordinate with ECNCCU for access to restricted data transfer documentation and dataset specifications to guarantee correct data formatting and submission.
