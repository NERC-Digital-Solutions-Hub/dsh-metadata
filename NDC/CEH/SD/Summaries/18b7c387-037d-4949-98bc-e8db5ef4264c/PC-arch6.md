# PC Protocol

## Aim
- To measure the chemical composition of precipitation and dry deposition (bulk precipitation) at ECN sites using a continuously open bulk collector.
- Rationale: understanding acid deposition and its ecosystem impacts; deposition consists of wet and dry components, with bulk collection capturing both for cost-effective monitoring and data linking with UKPCMN networks.

## Context and Rationale
- Acidic deposition has long been of interest; ongoing research links atmospheric deposition to ecological effects.
- Bulk deposition measurement provides a practical approach to characterize total input, despite not separating wet/dry components.

## Equipment and Method
- Bulk collector design: conical polythene funnel on a collecting bottle, with a 1 mm mesh Teflon filter; outer jacket to keep samples dark and cool; metal barrier with a 25 mm gap; bird deterrents with possible need for decoys.
- Funnel sizing: typically 152 mm diameter; two funnel sizes available (115 mm and 152 mm); collector mounted 1.75 m above ground.
- Sampling/handling specifics: standard cleaning between samples; ice or snow transfers to new bottle; lab handling includes volume measurement and subsequent chemical analyses.

## Location
- Place collectors upwind of contamination sources; avoid dusty tracks and animal houses; choose open locations away from obstructions; minimize vegetation trampling during visits.
- Secure installation: bolted to concrete or guyed.

## Sampling Procedure
- Weekly collection protocol (ECN standard): replace bottle and filter on a chosen weekly schedule (ECN uses Wednesdays at 0900 GMT when possible).
- Sample handling: wash and/or replace funnel and filter as needed; ensure rigorous prevention of contamination; ensure cap is tightly screwed on to prevent leakage.
- Transport and laboratory processing: return samples to the lab; determine precipitation volume by weight; measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water; filter and analyze dissolved constituents.

## Analytes and Calculations
- After unfiltered analysis: measure dissolved Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4^2-, PO4^3--P, and alkalinity.
- For flux calculations: use precipitation volume from nearby automatic weather station or standard raingauge; bulk collector volume may be less accurate after snow events.

## Labelling and Recording Conventions
- Unique sample identification required: ECN Measurement Code (PC), ECN Site ID, Location Code, and Sampling Date.
- Recording includes factors affecting chemistry (insects, dust, bird droppings, disturbances).
- Data transfer to ECN database follows Data Transfer documentation (restricted access via Site Managers’ extranet).

## Quality Assurance
- QA procedures align with Acid Deposition Monitoring Network practices, including assessment of sampling, handling, and analytical errors.
- References include key UK/ECN QA guidelines and protocol authors.

## Appendix I: Routine Sample Collection (Field)
- Required equipment and step-by-step handling to minimize contamination.
- Field notes to record obvious disturbances or anomalies.
- Emphasis on securing cap and avoiding contamination during bottle changes.

## Appendix II: Equipment Details
- Full assembly components: aluminum stand, bottle holder, reflector, funnel retainer, catchment funnel assembly, filter, and catchment bottle.
- Spares and recommended quantities per site.
- Primary supplier information provided.

## Specification of Results and Recording Conventions
- Core data: weekly variables including site code, core measurement code (PC), location code, setting out date/time, sampling time, volume, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, and concentrations for Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, and PO4--P.
- Units and precision are specified (e.g., conductivity in µS cm-1, concentrations in mg L-1 with defined significant figures).
- Recording forms: standard field recording form available from CCU; data format documentation available via restricted access.

## Note on Data Handling
- Volume estimates derived from bottle weight; use weather station measurements to supplement bulk volume accuracy.
- Data are structured to allow linking with other ECN datasets and UKPCMN sites for spatial trend analyses.
