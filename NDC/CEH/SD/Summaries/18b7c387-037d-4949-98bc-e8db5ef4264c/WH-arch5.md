# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale and Quality Control
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Deterioration is slowed by: filtration, cold storage, and, for Al and Fe determinations, acidification.
- Some procedures require laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.

## Initial Storage and Handling
- Store samples cold (1°C–4°C) if the interval before conductivity/pH measurement exceeds seven hours.
- Return to cold storage if filtration is not completed on the same day as measurements.
- If sending to another site, ship on the collection day using the fastest method; in transit, use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity Measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Report conductivity to 0.1 µS cm-1.

## pH Measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; the same subsample may be used for both conductivity and pH, but conductivity must be measured first and the subsample not returned to the main sample.
- Use separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Report pH to 0.01 pH unit.

## Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection using the method in Appendix I.
- Record filtration details with the unique sample codes defined in the Protocols.
- After filtration, analyse for: dissolved Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; DOC not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, prioritize determinands according to the documented order.

## Storage Prior to Chemical Analysis
- Storage temperature: 1°C–4°C.
- Ideally complete analysis within 16 days of collection; must be within 28 days.
- If samples are sent to another location for analysis, minimize the time out of cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

## Documentation and Data Submission
- Minimize time out of cold storage to ensure data integrity during transfer.
- Ensure next-day delivery to reduce storage gaps; document the handling and storage timeline to support data provenance and traceability.

## Appendix I: Filtering (Equipment, Procedures, and Sample Coding)
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membrane filters 0.45 µm (Whatman WCN), glass fibre filters GF/C, vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
- Handling: rinse all contact surfaces with deionised/distilled water; avoid touching filters; use forceps; single-use filters per sample.
- Pre-filtration: soil solution (SS) and river water (WQ) may require pre-filtering; pre-wash filters with 250 ml distilled water.
- Sub-sampling: if volume >100 ml, transfer 20 ml to a vial for Al and Fe determination and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labeling: use ECN Site Identification Code, Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler-specific codes; attach the unique reference to final ECN data.
- Suppliers and contact details are provided (examples include BDH/Whatman/Millipore suppliers).

## Appendix II: Bottle and Vial Washing
- Containers cleaned with a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Use Decon products (e.g., Decon-90) or suitable alternatives; rinse steps include multiple tap and deionised water rinses.
- After washing, containers are dried in warm air, shaken dry, recapped, and stored for reuse with the same sampler.
