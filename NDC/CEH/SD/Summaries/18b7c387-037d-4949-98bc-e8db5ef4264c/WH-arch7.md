# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale and data quality
- Samples deteriorate from collection due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Use filtration, cold storage (1–4°C), and, for Al and Fe determinations, acidification to slow deterioration.
- Some activities require laboratory training and safety compliance; guidance available from chemists performing analyses.

## Initial storage and sample handling
- If the interval to measurement >7 hours, store at 1–4°C.
- Filtered samples should be analyzed the same day; if not, store in cold storage and re-cool as needed.
- If sending samples to another site, send on the collection day by fastest method; in transit, keep in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.
- Conductivity measured within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C; results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.
- pH measured within 36 hours on the same unfiltered subsample; separate glass/reference electrodes; conductivity measured first; do not return subsample to main sample; results to 0.01 pH unit.

## Filtering
- Filtering must occur within 60 hours of collection ( Appendix I).
- Record filtering details using unique sample codes.
- After filtering, analyze for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻-P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; optional for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient to measure all determinands, prioritization guidance is provided in the Appendix I documentation.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Storage temperature: 1–4°C.
- Analysis should be completed preferably within 16 days of collection, but definitely within 28 days.
- If samples are sent to another location for analysis, minimize time out of cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

## Data management and sample identification
- Use unique sample codes; ensure data submitted to the ECN database include a complete, traceable reference.
- Required labeling fields (examples):
  - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
  - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date
  - Additional sampler code to uniquely identify the sample (e.g., SS sampler code)

## Bottle and vial washing
- Containers washed with laboratory cleaning agents before first use and approximately every six months or with high soiling.
- Cleaning agent should be phosphate- and hypochlorite-free.
- Use Decon (or equivalent) for washing; rinse steps: four washes in tap water, three in deionized/distilled water.
- After use, containers are rinsed, dried in warm, dust-free air, and re-capped immediately.

## Appendix I: Filtering (equipment and procedure)
- Filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil; 47 mm filters).
- Membrane filters: Whatman WCN, 0.45 µm.
- Glass fibre filters: Whatman GF/C.
- Vacuum pump: ~0.5 bar vacuum.
- All contact surfaces cleaned; filters handled with forceps; each filter used for a single sample.
- Pre-filtering may be used for soil solution (SS) and river water (WQ); pre-filter requires washing with 250 ml distilled water.
- If >100 ml volume, transfer a 20 ml subsample for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Label containers with ECN site, measurement code, location, date, and sampler code.

## Appendix II: Bottle and vial washing (procedure)
- Containers cleaned with cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Decon products recommended; follow specific rinsing regimens; air-dry and recapping steps outlined.
