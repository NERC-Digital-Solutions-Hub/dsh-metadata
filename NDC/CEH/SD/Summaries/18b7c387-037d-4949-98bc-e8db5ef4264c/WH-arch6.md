# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

- Purpose: To measure conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water, and to filter samples prior to chemical analysis.
- Rationale for preservation: Samples deteriorate due to chemical/microbiological processes; slowing deterioration via filtration, cold storage (1–4°C), and acidification for Al and Fe determinations when applicable.

## Key Procedures and Time/Storage Guidelines

- Initial storage
  - Store at 1–4°C if measurement of conductivity/pH occurs more than seven hours after collection.
  - Return to cold storage if filtering is not completed on the same day.
  - If sending samples for initial handling, ship the same day; use cool box with pre-frozen blocks for transit.

- Conductivity measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
  - Report results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm-1).
  - Conductivity measurement must occur before pH on the same subsample; do not return the subsample to the main sample after measurement.

- pH measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample (same subsample as conductivity, with separate electrodes).
  - Report results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

- Filtering
  - Perform within 60 hours of collection.
  - Use Appendix I methods; record filtering details with unique sample codes.
  - After filtration, analyze for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO42-, PO43-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; optional for precipitation water).
  - If sample volume is insufficient, prioritize determinands per separate chemical analysis documentation.

- Storage prior to chemical analysis
  - Maintain 1–4°C.
  - Analyses should be completed preferably within 16 days, but no later than 28 days after collection.
  - If sending to another location, minimize time out of cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

## Data Provenance, Coding, and Outputs

- Unique sample identification
  - Containers must be labeled with:
    - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
    - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date
    - Any additional sampler code (e.g., SS sampler code)
  - The unique reference should accompany final data submission to the ECN database.

- Data quality and transparency
  - Document all filtering steps and conditions; use the unique sample codes described in the Protocols (Appendix I).
  - Record materials, timing, and sequence of measurements to support data interpretation and reuse.

## Appendix I – Filtering (Equipment and Procedure)

- Required equipment
  - Filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil, 47 mm)
  - Membrane filters (Whatman WCN, 0.45 µm) or glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C)
  - Vacuum pump capable of ~0.5 bar vacuum
- Handling and cleanliness
  - Rinse all contact surfaces with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples.
  - Use forceps; each filter for a single sample; avoid touching filter surfaces.
  - If pre-filtering is needed for soil solution or river water, pre-filter through glass fibre, washing with 250 ml distilled water before use.
  - Transfer filtered water to clean, dry bottles; do not return to the unfiltered bottle.
  - For sample volumes >100 ml, aliquot 20 ml for Al and Fe determination and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Sample labeling and traceability
  - Ensure the final data submission includes the full unique reference.

## Appendix II – Bottle and Vial Washing

- Cleaning requirements
  - Wash containers with a laboratory cleaning agent prior to first use and approximately every six months, or when heavily soiled.
  - Cleaning agent should be free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Cleaning methods
  - Use Decon (or equivalent) for manual cleaning; avoid Dri-Decon.
  - Rinse four times with tap water and three times with deionised/distilled water (after use, rinse three times with distilled water and reuse with the same sampler).
- Drying and storage
  - Shake to remove water, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, and recap immediately.
