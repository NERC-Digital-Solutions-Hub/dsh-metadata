# WAG Protocol

## Aim
- Provide guidelines for the analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
- Laboratories have full responsibility for managing analytical resources.
- Laboratories must document methods, significant changes, and validation procedures.
- Analytical Procedures are reviewed annually by an Analytical Working Group with representatives from each lab.

## Scope and Responsibilities
- Each laboratory manages its resources; participating labs must conduct analyses under controlled conditions.
- Documentation of methodology, method changes, and validation procedures is required.
- Annual review of procedures by the Analytical Working Group.

## Approved Techniques and Reference Methods
- Tables list acceptable determinations (e.g., pH, conductivity, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, NH4-N, Cl, NO3-N, SO4-S, PO4-P, DOC, Total N) with multiple method options (e.g., HMSO blue books, AAS, IC, Col- methods, ICP/OES).
- Reference techniques provided for comparison and assessment of new methodologies.
- Notes clarify when techniques quantify related species and the need to monitor alternative techniques for bias.
- Analytical ranges/detection limits are lab-specific but should meet uniform guidelines; consider re-analysis if results near detection limits.

## Priority Listing (Sample Volume Constraints)
- 1: pH and conductivity.
- 2: Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+; then K+, Na+) and anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, then PO4 3-, Cl-).
- 4: NH4+-N.
- 5: DOC.
- 7: Total N and alkalinity.
- Guidance for handling and analytical options when volume is limited; refer to Initial Water Handling Protocol for sample handling.

## Providing Details of Methodology
- Labs keep detailed methods for operators; ECN database stores summary methodology per determinand per site.
- Meta-database records include site, measurement, determinand, date, typical concentrations, calibration ranges, method name, detection limit, and accuracy/precision notes.
- Records capture changes in methodology and assessments of suitability for purpose.

## Validation: Accuracy and Precision
- Validation via approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and interlaboratory quality checks (e.g., AQUACHECK).
- Accuracy: closeness to true value; track via participation in control schemes and accuracy corrections; record all checks and corrections.
- Precision: managed with quality control samples; monitor batch bias; avoid submitting data if QC indicates problems.

## Example of an Accuracy Record
- Demonstrates accuracy tracking for SO4 2-, including method (ion chromatography), laboratory, AQUACHECK scheme, results, mean, percentage relative error, and corrective actions.

## Precision and Quality Control Procedures
- Separate QC system for ECN participants; labs encouraged to use independent QC and interlaboratory comparisons.
- Possibility to compute between-site correction factors to detect rogue batches and long-term trends.
- Analysts manage QC; annual production of concentrated QC solutions (cation and anion) for continuity checks.

## Data Transfer and QC Data Records
- QC data submitted to the ECN Database Manager in the same format as regular samples, with preparation dates and measurement fields adjusted for QC context.
- Data record fields include measurement code, site ID, QC code, preparation dates, analysis completion dates, pH (unstirred/stirred), pH, conductivity, alkalinity, and various determinands (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, PO4-P, NO3-N, NH4-N, Cl, SO4-S, DOC, Total N).
- Quality codes accompany data where applicable.
- Example QC record format provided (Moor House).
