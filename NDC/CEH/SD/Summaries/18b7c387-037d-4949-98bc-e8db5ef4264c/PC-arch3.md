# PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY Version 1.1 (supplier contact details updated July 2005)

## Aim and Rationale
- Purpose: measure chemical composition of precipitation and dry deposition (bulk precipitation) at ECN sites using a continuously open bulk collector.
- Context: builds on long-standing interest in acid rain and atmospheric deposition; deposition impacts ecosystems are linked to future emission changes.
- Scope: bulk deposition captures both wet and dry components; intended for integration with UK Precipitation Composition Monitoring Networks (UKPCMN) data to enable spatial analysis.

## Equipment and Site Setup
- Bulk collector design: conical polythene funnel connected to a bottle; two funnel sizes (115 mm or 152 mm) with a 63° cone; collector height at 1.75 m.
- Contamination controls: removable 1 mm mesh filter; protective jacket; optional bird deterrents or decoys.
- Assembly components and spare parts: complete setup includes stand, bottle holder, reflector, funnel assembly, filters; recommended three funnel/bottle/filters per site.
- Location guidance: place upwind of contamination sources; avoid dusty tracks, animal houses, and obstructions; near soil solution samplers but not obstructing other instruments; secure to base or with guy ropes.

## Sampling Procedure
- Schedule: weekly bottle change (preferably Wednesdays at 0900 GMT).
- Collection process: replace filled bottle with clean bottle and filter; funnel cleaned or replaced; handle bottles and funnels to avoid contamination; ensure top of funnel remains horizontal; ensure cap is tightly closed for transport.
- Volume and handling: determine sample volume by weighing bottle contents; use nearby weather station data for precipitation volume when needed.
- Field notes: record potential disturbances (insects, dust, bird droppings, fires, etc.) on a field form.

## Laboratory Analysis and Recording
- Initial handling: measure pH and conductivity on unfiltered water; filter when specified.
- Analytes measured: dissolved Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4--P, and alkalinity.
- Data labeling: each sample labeled with ECN Measurement Code (PC), ECN Site ID, Location Code, and Sampling Date; forms include disturbance and site metadata.
- Volume determination: taken from nearby automatic weather station/raingauge; bulk collector volume may be less accurate after snowfall.

## Data Management, Metadata and Sharing
- Data transfer and formats: core dataset formats standardized and described in ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation (restricted extranet access via Site Managers); dataset identifiers must accompany results.
- Recording conventions: key parameters to identify a sample are Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, and Sampling Date/Time (GMT); weekly variables include time, volume, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, and a suite of ions with specified units and precision.
- Metadata capture: field recording forms capture potential interferences and disturbances to aid data verification and context.
- Governance and openness: documentation emphasizes data identification, provenance, and the need to share underlying data; dataset linkage to broader networks (UKPCMN) supports transparency and interoperability.

## Quality Assurance
- QA framework follows the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network procedures, addressing errors from sampling, handling, and analysis.
- References and external standards underpin methods (e.g., Hall 1986; Heyes et al. 1985; Last & Watling 1991).
