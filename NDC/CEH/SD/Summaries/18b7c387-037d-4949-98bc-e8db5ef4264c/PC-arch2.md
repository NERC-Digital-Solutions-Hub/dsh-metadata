# PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY Version 1.1 (supplier contact details updated July 2005)

## Aim
- Measure chemical composition of precipitation and dry deposition (bulk deposition) at ECN sites using a continuously open gauge.
- Capture wet and dry deposition as a bulk input to enable assessment of atmospheric pollutant deposition on ecosystems.
- Link ECN results with UK precipitation networks for spatial context.

## Rationale
- Acid rain and its ecological impacts have driven long-term monitoring since the 1970s.
- Deposition from the atmosphere affects physical, chemical, and biotic components of ecosystems and is sensitive to emission changes; bulk deposition provides a practical monitoring approach.

## Equipment
- Bulk collector design: conical polythene funnel (63° cone) on a polythene collection bottle; two funnel sizes (115 mm and 152 mm; 1.75 m above ground).
- 1 mm mesh Teflon filter to prevent debris; jacketed by polished steel to keep samples dark and cool.
- Bird deterrent device (may require augmentation with decoys).
- Appendix II lists complete assembly, spares, and supplier details.

## Location
- Place collector upwind of contamination sources; avoid dusty tracks and animal houses.
- Position in open area near the soil solution samplers and weather station (TSS), ensuring minimal obstruction to other instruments.
- Regular visits may disturb vegetation; collectors should be bolted to a base or secured by guy ropes.

## Sampling and collection
- Weekly sampling protocol: replace sampling bottle and clean/filter funnel; standard time is Wednesdays at 0900 GMT.
- Bottle handling: rinse or replace funnel with clean components; ice or snow must be melted into the new bottle without pre-cleaning if transferring.
- Volume measurement: determine sample volume by weighing bottle with contents (to the nearest ml).
- In-field measurements: measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water per ECN WH Protocol.
- Post-filter analysis: analyze filtered water for dissolved ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, NH4-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4--P, alkalinity).
- Volume flux calculations: use precipitation volume from nearby rain gauge or automatic station.

## Labelling and recording conventions
- Unique sample identification: ECN Measurement Code (PC), ECN Site ID, Location Code, Sampling Date.
- Mark sample bottles accordingly; include a field recording form noting potential sample-affecting factors (insects, dust, bird droppings, disturbances).

## Washing equipment
- Laboratory cleaning of funnel, filter, and bottle with designated cleaning agent per ECN WH Protocol.

## Quality assurance
- QA procedures follow those used by the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network.
- Includes evaluation of potential errors introduced during sampling, handling, and analysis.

## Appendix I. Routine sample collection (highlights)
- Required items: clean sample bottle with cap, de-ionised/distilled water for washing, forceps, two clean funnel filters, two clean funnels, cap, field recording form, etc.
- Steps: document disturbances, detach funnel, transfer bottle, replace filters, wash funnel if uncontaminated, ensure cap is secure, reattach funnel, verify funnel level, and ensure bottle cap is tightly sealed.

## Appendix II. Equipment details
- Full assembly components include aluminum stand, bottle holder, reflector, funnel retainer, catchment funnel, filter, and bottle.
- Spare parts and recommended counts per site.
- Sole supplier: Just Plastics Ltd; contact details provided.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Core variables recorded weekly at each ECN site:
  - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code (PC), Location Code, Sampling Time/Date (GMT), Volume, pH, Conductivity, Alkalinity, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4--P, NH4+-N, with specified units and recording precision.
- Data formats to be submitted to ECNCCU via defined dataset standards (refer to restricted Site Managers' extranet for data transfer documentation).
- Fields needed to uniquely identify samples: site code, core measurement code, location code, and sampling date/time (including time element if sampling frequency exceeds daily).

## Notes
- Volume flux should be derived from nearby rainfall measurements due to potential collection biases during snow or irregular collection.
- Recording forms exist to document field conditions potentially affecting sample chemistry.
