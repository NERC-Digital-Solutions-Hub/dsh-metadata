# PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY Version 1.1 (supplier contact details updated July 2005)

## Aim and Rationale
- Measure chemical composition of precipitation and dry deposition (bulk deposition) at ECN sites using a continuously open bulk collector.
- Recognize that deposition consists of wet and dry components; bulk collection captures both for UK ECN/UKPCMN integration.
- Ensure results support understanding of ecosystem impacts and potential future changes in emissions.
- Link ECN data with national UKPCMN data (started 1986) for geographical context.

## Equipment and Method
- Bulk collector design: conical polythene funnel (two sizes, 63° cone; typically 152 mm diameter), resting on a collecting bottle; 1 mm mesh Teflon filter to remove coarse debris; steel jacket to keep sample dark and cool; bird deterrent system.
- Height and placement: upper surface ~1.75 m above ground; locate upwind of contamination sources; avoid dusty tracks, animal houses; near TSS and soil samplers while minimizing vegetation trampling; bolted to concrete base or secured by guy ropes.
- Collection principles: collector records both wet and dry deposition; separation of components is possible but not implemented due to cost; standard practice is bulk deposition measurement.

## Location and Site Setup
- Place collector away from obstructions (buildings, trees) and potential contamination sources; open, unobstructed location near weather station if possible.
- Ensure proper securing to prevent movement and leakage.

## Sampling Procedures
- Weekly sampling protocol aligned with Warren Spring Laboratory methods; Wednesdays at 0900 GMT is the ECN standard for bottle changes.
- Procedure steps: replace bottle with clean bottle and filter; clean or replace funnel; manage ice/snow transfers to the new bottle without pre-cleaning; transport and lab handling details to preserve sample integrity.
- Volume determination: weigh bottle with contents (minus dry bottle weight) to determine precipitation volume; use nearby automatic weather station or standard raingauge for volume if bulk collector underestimates (e.g., after snow).
- On-site checks: record field observations (insects, dust, bird droppings, disturbances) using a field recording form.
- Sample handling: ensure funnel and cap are replaced and cleaned appropriately; document any contamination or delays.

## Labelling and Field Records
- Unique sample identification: ECN Measurement Code (PC), ECN Site ID, Location Code, Sampling Date (and time as applicable).
- Recording forms capture factors affecting chemistry (insects, dust, bird droppings) and local disturbances for traceability.

## Washing Equipment and Cleaning
- Laboratory washing of funnel, filter, and bottle with de-ionised/distilled water following ECN Initial Water Handling protocol.
- Maintain clean, uncontaminated equipment between samples.

## Quality Assurance
- QA procedures follow established Acid Deposition Monitoring Network guidelines (references provided).
- Include assessment of sampling, handling, and analytical errors to ensure data reliability.
- Documentation and cross-referencing with acknowledged QA standards and prior networks.

## Data and Recording Conventions
- Core measurement: precipitation chemistry (PC) with weekly data.
- Required dataset fields (first four) for each sample: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
- Measured variables (weekly): Volume (ml), pH, Conductivity (µS cm-1), Alkalinity (mg L-1), Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4- -P, NH4+-N.
- Units and precision: volume in ml; pH scale for conductivity is noted as units; various ions with specified significant figures (3 figs) as per protocol; data transfer formatting described in ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation.
- Data management: datasets linked to ECN Core dataset formats; contact ECNCCU for access to restricted documentation.

## Appendices

- Appendix II: Equipment details – complete assembly components, spares, funnel/bottle specifications, supplier information (Just Plastics Ltd) and recommended quantities per site.
- Equipment recommendations include ensuring the larger funnel size (152 mm) and multiple spare components available for each site.

## Note
- Date/time of last bottle emptied and set out documented in records to maintain traceability.
