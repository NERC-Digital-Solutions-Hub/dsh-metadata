# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

- Aim
  - To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution and river water.
  - To filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

- Rationale
  - Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes after collection.
  - Deterioration is slowed by filtration, cold storage, and, for Al and Fe determinations, acidification.
  - Requires laboratory training, specialized equipment, safety compliance, and coordination with chemists.

- Initial storage and handling
  - If the interval between collection and measurement exceeds seven hours, store samples cold (1–4°C).
  - If filtration is not completed the same day, return samples to cold storage.
  - If samples are sent to another site, ship on the day of collection using the fastest method.
  - Transit samples in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

- Conductivity measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
  - Express results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm⁻¹).
  - Use the method specified in HMSO (1978).

- pH measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; the same subsample can be used for both conductivity and pH.
  - Conductivity measurement should occur first; do not return the subsample to the main sample.
  - Use HMSO (1988) method with separate glass and reference electrodes.
  - Express results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

- Filtering
  - Filtering must occur within 60 hours of collection, following Appendix I methods.
  - Record filtering details with unique sample codes.
  - After filtration, analyze for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻-P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (DOC not mandatory for precipitation water).
  - If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, follow the priority order in Appendix I.
  - For samples >100 mL, transfer a 20 mL subsample for Al and Fe determination and acidify with 20 µL HCl.

- Storage prior to chemical analysis
  - Store at 1–4°C.
  - Analysis should be completed preferably within 16 days, but definitely within 28 days.
  - Minimize time out of cold storage if samples are sent for analysis; target next-day delivery and avoid Friday dispatch.

- Documentation and data traceability
  - Use a unique reference scheme to identify samples (ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code).
  - Ensure final data submitted to the ECN database includes the unique reference.

- Appendix I: Filtering (equipment and procedure)
  - Filtering setup: filter funnel assembly, membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters, vacuum pump (≈0.5 bar).
  - Handling: rinse all parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples.
  - Do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; single-use filters per sample.
  - Soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtering; pre-filter filters should be washed with 250 mL distilled water before use.
  - If volume >100 mL, aliquot 20 mL for Al/Fe and acidify as above.
  - Bottle labeling: ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code; these should appear with the final dataset.

- Appendix II: Bottle and vial washing
  - Wash containers with a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
  - Preferred cleaners: Decon/Dri-Decon alternatives; Decon-90 acceptable when no machine is available.
  - Rinse sequences: four rinses in tap water, three rinses in deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times in distilled water and re-cap.
  - Drying and storage: shake to remove droplets, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, and re-cap immediately.
  - Decon products can be obtained from listed suppliers.

- Procedure and suppliers
  - Detailed procedural steps and supplier information are provided within the WH Protocol (Appendices I and II and the Supplier listings).
