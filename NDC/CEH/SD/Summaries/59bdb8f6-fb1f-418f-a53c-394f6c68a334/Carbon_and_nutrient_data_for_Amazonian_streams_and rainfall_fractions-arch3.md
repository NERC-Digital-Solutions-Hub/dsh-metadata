# Sampling Regime

- Purpose and scope
  - Document describes environmental monitoring data collection focused on fluvial carbon (DIC, δ13C-DIC, DOC, POC) and related nutrients, plus rainfall-derived fractions (throughfall, stemflow, overland flow, rain water) in the Western Amazonian Tambopata basin, Peru.
  - Data collected to understand seasonal (wet/dry) hydrological controls on carbon concentrations and fluxes; supports broader monitoring aims of informing policy and decision-making.

- Study area and time frame
  - Regions: Tambopata National Reserve, Madre de Dios, Peru (streams MT and NC; rivers LT and TP).
  - Catchment context: LT (~2000 km2) and TP (~14000 km2) upstream; sampling points with varying widths and upstream drainage.
  - Field period: February 2011 – May 2012, with campaigns targeting different seasons; MT dries in dry season limiting sampling in Sep–Nov 2011.

- Measured parameters
  - Fluvial carbon: DIC (mg/L), δ13C-DIC (‰), DOC (mg/L), POC (mg/L).
  - Nutrients and major ions: Ca, Mg, K, Na (mg/L); TotP (μg/L); Si (mg/L).
  - Rainfall fractions: DIC, δ13C-DIC, DOC, POC, Ca, Mg, K, Na, TotP, Si across Rain water, Throughfall, Stemflow, and Overland flow.

- Sampling design and data sources
  - Fluvial sampling across three campaigns (Feb–Apr 2011; Sept–Dec 2011; Mar–May 2012).
  - Rainfall fractions sampled April–May 2012.
  - Datasets include prior submissions: DIC and related data for streams and rivers; rainfall fractions data; some data resubmitted to incorporate additional campaigns.

- Field collection methods
  - DIC: pre-acidified Exetainers; headspace method with triplicate samples and backup checks.
  - DOC: filtered water, acidified to pH ~3.9, degassed, measured by TOC combustion.
  - POC: measured by loss on ignition of dried filter papers.
  - Ca/Mg: Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.
  - K/Na: Flame photometry.
  - TotP: Colorimetric phosphomolybdate method with ascorbic acid reduction.
  - Si: Heteropoly Blue molybdosilicate method.
  - Rainfall fractions: throughfall collectors at a fixed plot; stemflow collected from eight selected tree species; one simple overland flow collector per stream bank.

- Quality control and calibration
  - DIC: drift correction standards every ~10 samples; randomised sample order; regular drift/QC standards.
  - DOC: eight-point calibration with blanks and drift checks; subset calibrations checked for consistency.
  - Cations and Si/TotP: repeated standard measurements to ensure instrument stability.
  - Overall data handling included QA steps to monitor instrument performance and data consistency.

- Data structure and availability
  - Two CSV files: Amazon streams C and nutrients; Amazon rainfall fractions C and nutrients.
  - Streams/rivers file: 14 columns including Time, Date, Type, Site, CollectorID, DOC, POC, DIC, δ13C-DIC, Ca, Mg, K, Na, TotP, Si (with NA where not analyzed).
  - Rainfall fractions file: 12 columns with analogous fields for rainfall-specific samples.
  - Data are accompanied by methodological details, units, and notes on data points not analyzed (NA).

- Limitations and gaps
  - MT stream dries periodically; September–November 2011 yielded no MT samples.
  - Some campaigns did not cover all sites or all parameters; NA entries indicate missing analyses.
  - Labor-intensive methods required careful sample handling; some data required resubmission to incorporate additional campaigns.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates end-to-end monitoring workflow: selection of carbon and nutrient measures, spatial-temporal sampling design, standardized field and lab protocols, rigorous QA/QC, and transparent data structure.
  - Highlights data governance and openness considerations (data sharing of underlying datasets) alongside metadata and provenance needs.
  - Provides a replicable template for integrating riverine carbon chemistry with rainfall-derived inputs in a rainforest context to inform policy and decision-making.
