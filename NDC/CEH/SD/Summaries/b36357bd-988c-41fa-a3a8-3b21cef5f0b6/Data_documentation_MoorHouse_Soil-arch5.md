# Soil Map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963)

- Overview
  - Polygons representing soil types in Moor House National Nature Reserve, digitized by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) from the 1963 Soil Map for the Nature Conservancy.
  - Mapping categories follow those described in the referenced table; origins and category definitions discussed in Johnson and Dunham (1963).

- Data Specification
  - Dataset consists of polygons delineating soil types.
  - Attribute columns:
    - SOIL: textual description of soil type.
    - SYMBOL: numeric code corresponding to the soil description.
  - Resolution: 1:10560 (approximately 6 inches to 1 mile).
  - Coordinate system: British National Grid; Projection: OSGB36 Transverse Mercator.
  - Extent: Great Britain.
  - Documentation notes indicate further mapping procedures and category descriptions in the Johnson & Dunham (1963) work.

  - Fell top podzol: Fell top podzol (Symbol 53)
  - Brown earth: Brown earth (Symbol 6)
  - Organic soils: Blanket bog (Symbol 2), Valley bog (Symbol 40)
  - Coarse scree: Coarse scree (Symbol 52)
  - Soil complexes: Peaty gley-peaty podzol (Symbol 3), Peaty podzol-Brown earth (Symbol 72), Solifluction creep (Symbol 70), Eroded blanket peat (Symbol 77), Mixed bottom lands (Symbol 51)
  - Made ground (historic mine tips): Made ground (Symbol 1)
  - Other/unsurveyed: Other (Symbol not specified), Unsurveyed area (Symbol 68)
  - River Tees: River Tees (Symbol 4)

- Provenance and Documentation
  - Source: Soil Map of Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963), Westmorland; Soil Survey for the Nature Conservancy.
  - Primary reference: G.A.L. Johnson, 1963; The Geology of Moor House, Monographs of the Nature Conservancy No. 2.
  - Supporting materials: Chapter 15 of the above publication; related environmental datasets and context (Environmental Change Network).

- Technical and Governance Considerations
  - Data were digitized from an older map (1963); users should assess currency and compatibility with modern soil classifications.
  - Metadata implications: ensure clear provenance, original scale, coordinate system (OSGB36), and the mapping methodology are captured for discoverability and reuse.
  - Potential data quality issues: possible incompleteness (e.g., Unsurveyed areas), legacy classifications, and non-interoperable formats due to dating.

- Usage and Access Considerations for Data Stewards
  - Use cases: historical soil distribution analysis, habitat and ecosystem studies requiring soil context, and integration with UK soil/landscape datasets.
  - Licensing and rights: confirm permissions for redistribution and reuse; attribute original sources (Johnson & Dunham, 1963; CEH digitization).
  - Update and interoperability: consider cross-walking 1963 classifications to modern soil taxonomies; document any planned updates or reconciliations; note any embargoes or access restrictions if applicable.
