# Soil Map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963)

## Overview
- Digitised polygons representing soil types for Moor House National Nature Reserve, derived from the 1963 Soil Map by the Soil Survey for the Nature Conservancy.
- Mapping categories and codes are described; procedures and category descriptions are outlined in Johnson and Dunham (1963).
- The file documents the soil categories used and their corresponding symbolic codes.

## Data details
- Columns:
  - SOIL: text description of soil type
  - SYMBOL: numeric code for the soil description
- Resolution: 1:10560 (6 inches to 1 mile), simplified
- Geographic reference: British National Grid (OSGB1936), Projection: Transverse Mercator
- Extent: Great Britain

## Notes on data structure and accessibility
- Some categories lack a defined SYMBOL in this dataset (MINERAL soils, ORGANIC soils, Skeletal soil, Other).
- Data governance and metadata concerns highlighted by monitoring framework authorship considerations, including the need for provenance, data sharing, and ensuring data quality and up-to-date information.

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Provides a structured, codes-based geospatial dataset suitable for environmental health monitoring, policy evaluation, and decision-making.
- Facilitates analysis of soil type distributions and their ecological and hydrological implications.
- Documentation supports data provenance (source map, digitisation by CEH, Johnson & Dunham reference).
- Potential barriers for monitoring: incomplete codes for some categories, data currency and update frequency, metadata completeness, data sharing constraints, and need for integration across organizational silos.
