# Chapter 15 SOILS

- Purpose and scope
  - Aimed to study upland soils of the Moor House Reserve through a detailed 6-inch scale soil survey to identify cover types and their distribution.
  - Full area survey was not feasible; routine physico-chemical laboratory investigations are lacking.
  - Organic soils/peat deposits have been studied separately (Chapter 16); the current focus is on mineral soils and their ecology.
  - Soil mapping outputs include large-scale plans for detailed ecological interpretation; peat erosion and post-glacial history are important contexts.

- Data collection and mapping outputs
  - Uses standard British soil mapping scales; publication maps reduced to a 1:63,360 scale (1 inch to about a mile) for area-wide depiction.
  - Large-scale plans (intermediate scales) produced for detailed ecological environments; simplified soil map of the Reserve included (Fig. 19).
  - Enclosures created to depict differing ecological environments at finer resolutions (e.g., Rough Sike enclosure; Greenhole enclosure).
  - Emphasis on identifying soil type, distribution, and boundaries; soils merge gradually rather than having sharp boundaries.

- Soil classification framework
  - British Soil Survey approach: soils are grouped into soil associations (cartographic units from the same parent material) and further subdivided into major soil groups and sub-groups based on morphology and environment.
  - Key horizons and terminology:
    - Organic horizons: L (litter), F (partly decomposed litter), H (humus/peat) – collectively form peat coverings.
    - Mineral horizons: A (topsoil), B (subsoil), C (parent material); occasional D horizon from weathered bedrock.
    - Iron-pan features in some podzols; mottling and gleying common in poorly drained soils.
  - Soil types described in relation to parent materials (Carboniferous rocks) and drainage regimes; majority are derived from Carboniferous material with some outcrops showing different parent materials (whin dolerite, limestone, sandstone).

- Major soil groups and their characteristics
  - Peaty-gleys
    - Develop under near-permanent or intermittent waterlogging; notable ochreous mottling in some profiles.
    - Predominant on western escarpment and upper slopes; thick peat cover often overlies mineral soils.
  - Gleys (mineral soils with gley features)
    - Overlain by peat in many areas; well-defined humus horizons in places; several subtypes described (including sub-blanket-peat gleys).
  - Peat deposits
    - Blanket-peat dominates eastern areas up to 2500 ft; thickness up to ~12 ft on flat ground; extensive peat erosion visible.
    - Basin-peat deposits occur in valley bottoms; peat sequences described in detail in Chapter 16.
  - Podzols
    - Two main types: peaty gleyed podzols and red-brown limestone podzols.
    - Peaty gleyed podzols often associated with upper slopes and are relatively restricted in extent.
    - Red-brown limestone podzols show development on limestone outcrops with characteristic iron oxide enrichment and hard iron-pan in some horizons.
  - Brown Earths
    - Immature soils with a uniformly colored B horizon; occur mainly on flushed slopes and beneath limestone outcrops; small in extent and of limited regional importance.
  - Red-brown limestone soils
    - Develop on level or gently sloping limestone areas; initial terra rossa-like characteristics with iron oxide enrichment in A and B horizons.
    - Formation linked to underground drainage through limestone joints and seasonal drying; profiles range from immature to mature.
  - Skeletal soils
    - Very stony soils forming over rock outcrops; large screes (sandstone, limestone, whin dolerite) with pockets of vegetation.
    - Include actively managed, shallow soils on rock outcrops and scree-supported plant communities.
  - Solifluxion soils
    - Two types: stable solifluxion soils (on flat fell tops) with surface stones extruded by frost; and creep (polygon) soils on bare or sparsely vegetated high ground.
    - Active polygonal patterns and surface stone arrangements common; important in high-altitude soil development.

- Soil complexes and special deposits
  - Soil complexes: areas where two or more soil types occur in close proximity or transition (e.g., blanket-peat and peaty gley soils).
  - Moor complexes: typically include blanket-peat, flushed blanket-peat, peaty alluvium, and thin alluvium along moorland streams.
  - Mixed bottom lands: alluvial and peaty-peat elements along larger streams.
  - Made ground: areas of mine tips and ore tailings with highly variable soils.

- Relationship with geology and landscape
  - Soils reflect underlying Carboniferous geology with drainage patterns strongly influenced by bedrock and drift materials.
  - Iron oxide concentration and pH changes in red-brown limestone soils tied to groundwater movement and seasonal drought.
  - Peat development largely shaped by post-glacial history, with blanket-peat and basin-peat sequences influencing habitat types.
  - Solifluction and frost action drive surface rock movement, affecting soil depth and horizon development, especially on high ground.

- Data gaps and limitations (implications for data governance)
  - Incomplete full-area soil survey; significant portions remain less explored.
  - Routine physico-chemical laboratory investigations are lacking, limiting quantitative soil metrics.
  - Complexes and transitional zones require careful interpretation and may benefit from standardized, repeatable data collection.

- Implications for data management and future work
  - Develop and maintain a clear, scalable data model linking soil types to parent materials, drainage status, horizon features, and vegetation associations.
  - Ensure standardized metadata for horizon descriptions, color plates, and reference profiles; capture uncertainty in boundary delineations between soil types.
  - Create or enhance discoverability of soil maps, crosswalks to vegetation communities, and peat dynamics data to support ecological analyses and land management decisions.
  - Plan for iterative updates as more physico-chemical data become available and as peat erosion or land-use changes alter soil distributions.
