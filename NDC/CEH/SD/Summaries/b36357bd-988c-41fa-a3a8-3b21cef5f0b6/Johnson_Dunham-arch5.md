# Chapter 15 SOILS

## Overview
- The upland soils of the Moor House Reserve have been studied primarily through a detailed 6-inch to mile-scale soil survey to identify cover types and their distributions.
- Full, routine physico-chemical laboratory investigations are lacking; mineralogy has been investigated; organic soils (peat) have been studied extensively in relation to Post-glacial vegetational history.
- Focus has been on soils in uplands and moorland contexts, with ecological and habitat implications noted; interest in marginal land and its productivity is acknowledged.

## Mapping and data collection
- Soil maps are produced at standard scales used by the Soil Survey of Great Britain: 6-inch and one-scale maps, reduced to 1:63,360 for publication. This scale delineates areas of about five acres but may oversimplify ecological detail.
- To capture ecological variation, large-scale plans have been produced (e.g., Rough Sike enclosure, Greenhole enclosure). An intermediate scale (6 inches to the mile) provides more detail but is too complex for smaller reproductions.
- A simplified soil map of the Reserve is included (Fig. 19). Detailed mapping is available for small areas of particular biological interest.
- The principal function of the soil survey is to identify and describe soil types and record their distributions and boundaries. Boundaries between soil series are often gradual rather than sharp.

## Classification schemes
- The British Soil Survey provides the lead in classification, grouping soils into:
  - Soil associations (cartographic units: areas with soils developed on the same parent material and near each other).
  - Major soil groups (morphology-based classifications such as gleys, podzols, brown earths, red-brown limestone soils, skeletal soils).
  - Sub-groups and divisions to reflect environments under which soils formed.
- Soil series can be further subdivided into associations and groups to aid interpretation and mapping.
- Soil horizons are identified with standard nomenclature (L, F, H for organic surface layers; A, B, C, D for mineral horizons) and recognized per soil profile. Not all horizons are present in every soil type.
- The soil profile descriptions cover diverse groups: peaty-gleys, gleyed soils, podzols, brown earths, red-brown limestone soils, skeletal soils, solifluxion soils, and others.

## Major soil types described
- Peat and peat-derived soils dominate the Reserve, with blanket-peat and basin-peat patterns described in detail.
- Mineral soils are divided into six major groups, largely derived from Carboniferous parent materials:
  - Gleys (peaty and non-peaty variants)
  - Podzols (including peaty gleyed podzols)
  - Brown earths
  - Red-brown limestone soils
  - Skeletal soils
  - Soil complexes and solifluction soils
- Red-brown limestone soils show terra rossa-like characteristics in places and develop via drainage and iron oxide enrichment related to limestone bedrock.
- Skeletal soils include scree and thin immature soils over bedrock outcrops, supporting unique microhabitats.
- Soil complexes describe areas where two or more soil types occur in proximity and transition over short distances; examples include blanket-peat complexes, moor complexes, alluvial and mixed bottom lands, and “made ground” (mine tips and ore tailings).
- Solifluxion soils occur at high altitudes with both stable and creep forms; polygonal and creep soils display distinct surface stone patterns and horizon development.

## Horizons and profiles
- Detailed horizon designations (L, F, H; A, B, C, D) are used to describe organic and mineral layers, including humus, peat thickness, iron pans, mottling, and horizon boundaries.
- Blanket-peat often overlies mineral horizons with complex interactions (e.g., aggradation and reduction conditions), with diverse peat thickness (often > 1 ft, up to 12 ft in places).
- Iron pans and podzol development (including B horizons with mottling and illuvial iron oxide enrichment) are noted in several soil types.
- Profiles illustrate how drainage, bedrock, and peat thickness influence soil development, including mor-phic changes between immature and mature forms (e.g., red-brown limestone soils showing progressive iron oxide enrichment).

## Data gaps and limitations
- Incomplete complete soil survey coverage for the area; routine laboratory investigations are lacking.
- The boundary between soil series is often gradual, making precise delineation challenging.
- The complexity of mapping large, variable upland terrains can hinder straightforward digitization and interoperability across systems.

## Data products and availability
- Published products include:
  - A simplified soil map of the Reserve (Fig. 19).
  - Large-scale plans for specific enclosures and detailed cross-sections (plates and color plates).
  - Color plates illustrating soil profiles and key horizons (e.g., Profiles for podzols, red-brown limestone soils).
- Soil pit descriptions and profile sections (e.g., well-documented profiles at Dun Fell, Hard Hill) provide ground-truth data for interpretation.
- The data underpin ecological and vegetational studies, with references to vegetation types co-located with soil types (e.g., Eriophoretum, Callunetum, Juncus spp.).

## Data standards and governance implications
- Data should be captured with clear, standardized horizon nomenclature and scale metadata (1:63,360 publication scale; 6-inch to mile detailed mappings).
- Documentation should include:
  - Classification scheme (soil associations, major groups, sub-groups).
  - Map unit definitions and boundaries (noting gradual transitions).
  - Soil depth, peat thickness, horizon depths, color, texture, mottling, iron pan presence, drainage status.
  - Vegetation associations and parent material context.
  - Spatial references for map units and sample pits (where available).
  - Provenance and sources (related publications: Muir 1956; Crompton 1952, 1956; Robinson 1951; Taylor 1959; Colour Plates; Chapter references).
- Given the data richness and multiple sources, a unified digital schema would support cross-survey interoperability and reuse in ecological and hydrological studies.
- There is a need for ongoing data quality assurance, including field verification to address boundaries and horizon interpretations, and future lab analyses to fill current gaps.

## Recommendations for data stewardship
- Create a unified, digital soil database that captures:
  - Map units (soil associations, major groups, sub-groups) with precise geometry and boundary uncertainty.
  - Horizon-level data (L, F, H; A, B, C, D), depths, textures, colors, mottling, iron pans, peat thickness, drainage class.
  - Environmental context (parent material, bedrock, outcrops, slope, elevation).
  - Vegetation associations and ecological relevance.
  - Peat dynamics ( blanket-peat versus basin-peat; thickness variability; erosion status).
  - Complexes and alluvial/mixed bottom lands with transitional boundaries.
  - Spectral or color plate references and key illustrational plates and profiles.
- Standardize data formats and metadata to enable cross-site comparisons and long-term preservation.
- Prioritize scalable mapping outputs (digital vector maps with linked raster plates) to balance detail with publishable accessibility at various scales.
- Establish data update protocols and versioning, given ongoing peat erosion, solifluction processes, and changes in outcrop exposure.
- Ensure accessibility for researchers and data users, with clear citations and provenance trails to primary sources.
