# Chapter 15 SOILS

- Purpose and scope
  - Upland soils survey concentrated on a detailed 6-inch scale to map cover types and their distribution.
  - Full soil survey of the area was not possible; routine physico-chemical laboratory investigations were lacking.
  - Mineralogy examined; organic soils/deposits studied extensively in relation to post-glacial vegetational history (Chapter 16 covers peat deposits in greater detail).
  - Interest in upland soils reflects broader ecological and biological habitat questions; limited attention previously given to ex­posed upland sites by pedologists.

- Soil mapping and scales
  - Field maps produced at standard 6-inch and other scales; publications reduced to a 1:63,360 scale (1 inch to about a mile) which allows delineation of areas roughly five acres in size.
  - For ecological/biological studies, large-scale maps have been prepared (e.g., soil enclosures and detailed portrayals around key habitats).
  - Boundaries between soils are rarely sharp; soils tend to merge gradually, complicating strict cartographic delineation.

- Soil classification and map units
  - British Soil Survey framework used: soils grouped into associations (cartographic units formed from soils developed on the same parent rock) and, for detailed purposes, into major soil groups.
  - Major soil groups described: gleys, podzols, brown earths, red-brown limestone soils, skeletal soils, soil complexes, and solifluction soils.
  - Soils are described and categorized by horizon development (L, H, F for surface organic layers; A, B, C, D for mineral horizons) and by notable features such as iron pans, mottling, or gleying.
  - Peat is a dominant surface layer in many areas, with soil classification and mapping reflecting the thickness and influence of surface peat.

- Soils of Moor House Reserve: main types and distributions
  - Peat and peat-influenced soils
    - Blanket-peat: dominant east of the summit ridge; thickness up to about 12 ft in places; omnipresent surface peat that is often permanently waterlogged; basin-peat in valleys; peat erosion exposes underlying mineral soils.
    - Peat-based gleys and sub-blanket-peat gleys: mineral substrate beneath blanket-peat remains permanently waterlogged in places, forming sub-blanket-peat gleys; variations influence vegetation and hydrology.
    - Ombrogenous blanket-peat and fern- or sedge-dominated vegetation; peat stratigraphy described in detail in related chapters.
  - Mineral soils (derived from Carboniferous rocks)
    - Gleys: formed under permanent or intermittent waterlogging; ochreous mottling; restricted largely to western escarpment and upper slopes.
    - Podzols: two notable variants; peaty gleyed podzols (often with a hard iron-pan) and associated peaty gleyed profiles; limited distribution.
    - Brown earths: immature soils with B horizon development; occur mainly on steep, flushed slopes; base-rich drainage patterns below limestone outcrops; less extensive in coverage.
    - Red-brown limestone soils: develop on level or gently sloping limestone outcrops; may resemble terra rossa-like profiles; iron oxide enrichment from rising groundwater during drought periods; surfaces show horizons with iron-pan features and membranous clays.
    - Skeletal soils: very stony scree soils over bedrock and thin immature soils; pockets of vegetation in scree zones; include limestone- and sandstone-derived variants; some pockets with redder, base-rich pockets.
    - Fertile, red-brown soils on igneous outcrops (Whin dolerite, tuf - areas near Hard Hill and Knock Ore Gill) with similar red-brown to ferruginous characteristics as limestone-derived soils.
  - Soil complexes
    - Areas with repeated presence and rapid alteration between soil types, notably where blanket-peat coexists with bare eroded peat, peaty gleyed soils, and alluvium.
    - Moor complex and mixed bottom lands are persistent features along moorland streams, with alluvium, blanket-peat, and peat-derived soils in mosaic patterns.
    - Made ground: extensive mine tips and ore tailings form highly variable, man-made soil complexes.
  - Solifluction soils (high altitude)
    - Stable solifluction soils: well-developed stone layers extruded by frost; blockfields or debris-dominated surfaces on flat fell tops.
    - Creeping (unstable) soils: orange-brown, unstable on slopes with coarse material atop finer material; active under current climate.
    - Polygon soils: more stable, with stone polygons on bare tops of high fells; surface stone concentration with leached A horizons and iron pan features where present.

- Soil profiles and horizons (typical descriptions)
  - Surface organic layer (L, H, F) common over peat and organic-rich soils.
  - Mineral horizons: A (topsoil), B (subsoil with color/structure changes and possible iron pan), C (weathered parent material), D (weathered bedrock or discontinuities, sometimes with in situ shales).
  - Iron pans: recurring, hard, indurated horizons that influence drainage and solum development.
  - Gleying and mottling: indicators of reducing conditions and waterlogging, especially in peat-affected and poorly drained zones.
  - Peat stratigraphy and depth variation: variable peat thickness across the Reserve, influencing vegetation and hydrology.
  - Profiles illustrate transitions from peat-dominated profiles to mineral soil horizons, including podzols and brown earths with varying degrees of development.

- Formation processes and regional geology
  - Post-glacial history shaped peat formation, erosion, and solifluction; many soil types reflect the underlying Carboniferous bedrock and sandstone bands.
  - Groundwater movement, capillarity, and seasonal drought contribute to iron oxide enrichment in red-brown limestone soils.
  - Solifluxion and ground movement have heavily influenced soil development, especially in high-relief areas with little peat cover.

- Vegetation relationships
  - Soils support distinct plant communities: Eriophoretum, Callunetum, Juncus spp., Polytrichum spp., and other bog or heathland types.
  - Vegetation succession and peat depth influence soil form and Class: for example, certain podzols and gleys are associated with specific plant communities and hydrological regimes.

- Data and GIS implications
  - The soil map captures a highly heterogeneous landscape with many small-scale units; exact boundaries are often gradational.
  - For GIS, this requires careful generalization when transferring to larger scales, and explicit representation of soil complexes and mosaics (e.g., blanket-peat/peaty gley/sodic zones).
  - Peat thickness and degree of waterlogging are critical variables for ecological modelling and habitat assessment.
  - The extensive peat cover and ongoing peat erosion necessitate up-to-date mapping to reflect dynamic changes in surface substrate and hydrology.
  - Many soil units are small or transitional; data should support multi-unit mosaics rather than single-feature delineations where appropriate.

- Summary of key soil types to be aware of in the Reserve
  - Blanket-peat and peat-dominated surfaces with extensive organic layers.
  - Peaty-gleys and sub-blanket-peat gleys under varying drainage conditions.
  - Gleys and podzols, including peaty gleyed podzols with iron-pan features.
  - Brown earths and red-brown limestone soils with horizon development and iron-oxide enrichment mechanisms.
  - Skeletal soils and scree-derived soils on outcrops and slopes.
  - Red-brown limestone soils showing terra rossa-like characteristics in deeper profiles.
  - Solifluction soils on high-altitude slopes, including crept, polygonal, and stable surface forms.
  - Complexes and man-made formations (mixed bottom lands, moor complexes, and made ground from mining activity).

- Practical notes for GIS users
  - Incorporate horizon-based attributes (L, H, F, A, B, C, D) where available to enable soil profile comparisons.
  - Represent soil complexes and mosaics as multi-unit features rather than single homogeneous polygons.
  - Include terrain and drainage indicators to support hydrological modelling (e.g., gleying, iron-pan presence, peat thickness).
  - Track peat dynamics (erosion and deposition) as a factor in land management and ecological studies.
  - Be mindful of scale effects: detailed field mapping at 6-inch scales may not translate directly to coarser publication scales without generalization.

- Reference points
  - The Moor House soils inventory emphasizes the dominance of organic deposits, the diversity of mineral soil types linked to local geology, and the interplay between drainage, solifluction, and vegetation.
  - The Soil Survey framework provides a structured basis for mapping associations and major soil groups across upland terrain, with explicit attention to horizon structure and surface processes.
