# Chapter 15 SOILS

- A detailed upland soils study of the Moor House Reserve focused on a 6-inch scale soil survey to identify cover types and their distribution; a full area survey was not possible, though mineralogy of soils has been investigated and organic deposits studied in relation to post-glacial vegetational history (Chapter 16). The work emphasizes field mapping, soil types, and their ecological contexts, with peat deposits described in greater detail in Chapter 16.

## Data Resources and Mapping Scales

- Field maps primarily at 6-inch and 1-inch-to-mile scales, reduced to 1:63,360 for publication; coarse mapping can depict about five acres per inch at this scale.
- Intermediate-scale maps (6 inches to a mile) reveal detailed soil variation; large-scale maps (enclosures) cover specific biologically interesting areas.
- A simplified soil map of the Reserve is included (Fig. 19).
- Data types include soil distribution, horizons, and associations, with references to color plates and detailed profiles.
- Soils are classified and described by horizons (organic and mineral) and by broader soil groupings.

## Soil Classification, Horizons, and Profile Descriptions

- Horizon notation:
  - Organic surface horizons: L (litter), H (humus/decomposed organic matter), F (partly decomposed litter with recognizable debris).
  - Mineral horizons: A (topsoil influenced by climate and plants), B (lower mineral horizon, sometimes ferruginous, often iron-rich), C (weathered parent material).
- Common soil horizons are described to establish soil profiles across the Reserve (podzols, gleys, brown earths, etc.).
- Peat and peat-derived horizons dominate many profiles; in thick peat, L-F-H boundaries are often indistinct.
- Soil maps differentiate soil associations (cartographic units) from major soil groups (morphological classifications like gleys, podzols, brown earths, organic soils).

## Principal Soil Types and Profiles

- Peaty-gleys: mineral soils with an organic peat overprint; prominent on areas with permanent or intermittent waterlogging and ochreous mottling in some horizons.
- Sub-blanket-peat gleys: mineral substrates beneath thinner blanket-peat or eroded peat, important where peat depth has decreased.
- Gleyed soils: sub-blanket-peat gleys and peaty-gleys; often show greenish-grey solum with ochreous mottling.
- Podzols (peaty-gleyed podzols): notable for hard iron-pan horizons (Bz) beneath peat; well-drained zones with pale leached upper horizons and characteristic podzol colours.
- Brown earths: immature, under flushed slopes and below limestone outcrops where base-rich drainage influences profile development; generally limited extent on the Reserve.
- Red-brown limestone soils: well-drained clay-loam soils on limestone outcrops; show terra rossa-like colouring due to iron oxides; development involves upward movement of iron-rich water and capillary action from underlying limestone.
- Skeletal soils: initially dominated by unaltered rock fragments (scree) over bedrock; highly stony and often support pockets of specialized vegetation; include fertile red-brown variants on some outcrops.
- Solifluxion soils: creep and polygon soils on high altitude slopes; two forms—stable solifluxion (often with iron-pan features) and creeping, polygonal soils on flat fell tops.
- Soil complexes: areas where two or more soil types recur over short distances; include blanket-peat/peaty gley complexes and moor complexes (areas along streams with blanket-peat, alluvium, and thin alluvium).
- Made ground: anthropogenic soils formed by mine tips and ore tailings, widely variable and mapped as a distinct complex.
- Blanket-peat and basin-peat: dominant surface deposits in many areas; basin-peat occurs in peat-filled basins along the valleys.
- Other minor soils: red-brown limestone soils (terra rossa-type profiles on level to gently sloping limestone surfaces); Whin dolerite, sandstone, and granite-associated soils (often red-brown and skeletal in character).

## The Moor House Soils: Dominant Divisions

- Six major mineral soil divisions (all derived from Carboniferous parent material) present:
  - Gleys (peaty and non-peaty variants)
  - Podzols (including peaty-gleyed podzols)
  - Brown earths
  - Red-brown limestone soils
  - Skeletal soils
  - Solifluxion soils
- Organic soils (peat deposits) dominate the landscape, with roughly 70% peat cover in the Reserve; peat dynamics and erosion influence surface soil formation.
- In many areas, peat overlays mineral horizons, with erosion exposing underlying substrates and changing soil type distributions over time.
- Specific outcrop-focused profiles (e.g., Great Dun Fell, Little Dun Fell, Hard Hill) illustrate well-drained podzols on sandstone outcrops and immature red-brown limestone soils where limestones act as a D horizon.

## Geological Context and Processes

- The soils reflect underlying Carboniferous rocks and complex post-glacial history, including:
  - Extensive blanket-peat deposition during the post-glacial period; erosion of peat has revealed mineral soils in many high-ground areas.
  - Solifluxion (freeze-thaw-driven soil movement) shaping crepe soils and polygonal ground features; active under current climate in exposed areas.
  - Iron oxide enrichment and iron-pan formation within podzol and limestone soils, driven by groundwater movement and summer drought conditions.
  - Underground limestone drainage influencing soil profiles, including terra rossa-like features on red-brown limestone soils.
- The interaction between geology, drainage, peat dynamics, and climate governs soil formation and transformation across the Reserve.

## Vegetation Associations and Ecological Context

- Vegetation communities closely align with soil types:
  - Eriophoretum, Callunetum, Juncus spp., Polytrichum spp., Deschampsia flexuosa, Festuca ovina, Sphagnum in peat-rich zones.
  - Distinct plant communities on peaty, gleys, podzols, and limestone-derived soils, with transitions corresponding to soil horizons and moisture regimes.
- The soils support diverse ecological habitats, including bogs, heath, and dry scree zones, influencing habitat management and conservation planning.

## Data Products, Applications, and Use Cases

- Potential data products:
  - Multi-scale soil maps: associations, major soil groups, and horizon-level classifications.
  - Detailed soil profiles database, capturing L/H/F and A/B/C horizons, peat thickness, and iron-pan presence.
  - Peat depth and thickness maps ( blanket-peat, basin-peat, and peat erosion zones).
  - Complexes and mosaics maps (soil complexes, moor complexes, mixed bottom lands, made ground).
  - Vegetation–soil association maps linking Eriophoretum, Callunetum, Juncus beds to underlying soil types.
- Useful applications:
  - Ecological and habitat modeling across upland landscapes.
  - Hydrological and drainage planning, particularly in gleys and podzol-dominated areas.
  - Conservation management and land-use planning for moorland reserves.
  - Historical/post-glacial landscape reconstruction by integrating soil maps with stratigraphic data.
  - Baseline data for future soil surveys and monitoring of peat erosion and soil development processes.

## Challenges and Gaps

- Patchy peat cover and extensive complexity of soil complexes complicate mapping and boundary delineation.
- Variation in data density across narrow ridges and deeply draped peat areas can hinder precise classification.
- The combination of multiple parent materials (Carboniferous rocks, outcrops of limestone, whin dolerite, sandstone) requires integrated datasets to accurately model soil formation processes.
- Some soil types occur only in small pockets (e.g., fertile red-brown limestone soils on limited limestone outcrops) and may be underrepresented in coarse maps.
- The peat dynamics and ongoing erosion worldwide imply that soil maps may need periodic updates to reflect changing surface schemes (as peat is removed or buried by deposition).

## Additional Context and References

- The document situates soil descriptions within broader geological and vegetational contexts of Moor House Reserve.
- Peat and soil details are integrated with ecological and vegetational chapters (peat deposits discussed in Chapter 16).
- The work emphasizes the need for scalable, detailed data products to support ecological interpretation, land management, and future research.
