# Soil Map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963)

## Overview
- Digitized polygons representing soil types, derived by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology from the 1963 Soil Map of Moor House NNR (Westmorland).
- Mapping categories described in the table associated with Johnson and Dunham (1963).

## Dataset content
- Polygons correspond to areas of soil types.

## Attributes and metadata
- SOIL: text description of soil type.
- SYMBOL: numeric code for the soil description.
- Resolution: 1:10560 (approx. 6 inches to 1 mile), simplified.
- Coordinate system: British National Grid; Projection: Transverse Mercator (OSGB36).
- Extent: Great Britain.

## Uses for environmental monitoring
- Establishes historical baseline for soil distribution to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Enables categorization and standardised reporting of soil types for monitoring programs.

## Data management and access considerations
- Dataset is digitized from an older map; intended to be stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals.
- One of the challenges is increasing the dataset’s value by integrating with other relevant data and enabling broader access for reuse.
