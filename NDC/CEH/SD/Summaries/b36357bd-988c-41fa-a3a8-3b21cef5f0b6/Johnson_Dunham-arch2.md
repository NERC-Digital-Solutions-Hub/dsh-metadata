# Chapter 15 SOILS

- The Moor House Reserve soil study is primarily a detailed 6-inch scale survey to identify cover types and their distribution, with the full area survey not completed. A mineralogy study has been done; organic soils (peat) have been studied extensively for Post-glacial vegetational history (Chapter 16). Upland soils receive less pedological attention than agricultural lands, but ecological work on mountain regions has linked soils to habitats and potential marginal land productivity.

- Mapping and scale
  - Field maps use standard scales of 6 inches and 1 inch to 1 mile (63360 scale) for publication; at 1:63360, about five-acre areas can be depicted.
  - Large-scale maps (e.g., soil complexes near special biological interest areas) have been prepared at intermediate scales (6 inches to mile) and simplified maps are included.
  - The principal aim of mapping is to identify and describe soil types and their distributions; boundaries between soil series are not always sharp because soils merge gradually.

- Soil classification framework
  - Following the British Soil Survey approach: soils are grouped into associations (cartographic units) based on parent material, typically derived from Carboniferous rocks in this reserve.
  - Major soil groups on the Reserve: gleys, podzols, brown earths, red-brown limestone soils, skeletal soils, soil complexes, solifluction soils.
  - For comparative purposes, horizons are described with standard terms: L (litter), F (partly decomposed litter), H (humus/peat). Mineral horizons are A, B, and C, with descriptions of leaching, iron mottling, pan formation, and gleying as appropriate.

- The Moor House soils: major divisions and key features
  - Dominant organic soils (peat)
    - About 70% of the Reserve is covered by organic soils; blanket-peat deposits can reach up to 12 feet in depth.
    - Thick peat is widespread on level ground and slopes; peat erosion has exposed underlying mineral soils in many areas.
    - Basin peats (Upper and Lower Valleys) record post-glacial peat accumulation; peat is described in greater detail in Chapter 16.
  - Mineral soils (six major divisions, largely from Carboniferous parent material)
    - Gley soils and peaty-gleys: Permanent or intermittent waterlogging; ochreous mottling is common where present.
      - Peaty-gleys have peat горизон thicknesses up to about 12 inches (and more) overlaying mineral horizons.
      - Sub-blanket-peat gleys form where peat is thinner or drainage changes; important where peat erosion exposes mineral substrates.
    - Podzols (including peaty gleyed podzols)
      - Notable for very hard cemented iron-pan horizons (Bz) and an upper A horizon; often show a grey leached A horizon with an iron-pan beneath.
      - Peaty gleyed podzols are restricted to upper slopes and small tracts; they are less extensive but locally important.
    - Brown Earths
      - Immature soils with a uniformly colored B horizon; often occur on flushed slopes below limestone outcrops where base-rich drainage concentrates particles downslope.
      - Associated with creep-like features on escarpment slopes and summit ridges.
    - Red-Brown Limestone Soils
      - Develop on level to gently sloping limestone; distinctive red-brown clay-loam profiles well-drained by underlying porous limestone.
      - Often show terra rossa-like features with iron oxides; formation linked to capillary movement of iron-rich solutions from limestone and dissolution of joint clays.
      - Profiles progress from less altered gleyed drift to mature red-brown horizons with concentrated iron oxides.
    - Skeletal soils
      - Very stony scree soils and thin immature soils over bedrock; occur below rock outcrops on limestone, whin dolerite, sandstone, etc.
      - Often host pockets of specialized vegetation among rocks; fertility is generally low; some fertile red-brown limestone-like outcrops occur in limited patches.
    - Solifluction soils
      - Two recognized types on high-altitude slopes: stable solifluxion (gleyed mineral horizons under blanket peat) and creep/polygon soils on fell tops.
      - Creeping orange-brown soils form where summer rain and winter solifluxion concentrate surface material; polygon soils on flat tops show surface stone polygons with leached layers and iron-pan features.
  - Soil complexes
    - Areas where two or more soil types are repeatedly present within short distances; notably common near blanket-peat margins and moor complexes.
    - Include moor complexes (blanket-peat, peaty alluvium/alluvium, and alluvium) and mixed bottom lands (alluvium with blanket-peat and bare drift/bedrock).
    - Made Ground: extensive mine tips and ore tailings form a widespread, highly variable soil complex.
  - Vegetation relationships
    - Peaty areas support Eriophoretum and Callunetum communities; herbaceous and moss-dominated communities (Juncus, Polytrichum, Deschampsia) are common in mineral soils.
    - Vegetation types help indicate soil moisture, pH, and drainage status, reinforcing the value of integrated soil-vegetation datasets for monitoring.

- Notable formation processes and history
  - Post-glacial solifluxion and ground movement have heavily shaped soils on the fell tops, contributing to scree formation and soil impoverishment in weathered screes.
  - Blanket-peat development is tied to historical waterlogging and basin conditions; peat erosion is actively exposing mineral substrata in some regions, influencing current soil-forming processes.
  - Iron oxide movement from limestone and the creation of iron pans are central to the development of red-brown limestone soils; groundwater and seasonal moisture dynamics drive profile differentiation.
  - The study links soil profiles to glacial/post-glacial history, rock types (Carboniferous, Whin Sill, Dun Fell sandstone, Great Limestone), and drainage patterns.

- Implications for environmental monitoring and data integration
  - The wide range of soil types and their strong ties to drainage, peat thickness, and bedrock mean soils are critical indicators of hydrological status and ecosystem health.
  - Mapping at multiple scales (from 1:63360 to larger scales near ecologically sensitive areas) supports targeted monitoring and integration with vegetation, hydrology, and climate data.
  - Data on peat depth, peat erosion, soil horizons (including iron pans and mottling), and soil complexes provide essential inputs for monitoring environmental health, site productivity, and policy-relevant environmental performance over time.
