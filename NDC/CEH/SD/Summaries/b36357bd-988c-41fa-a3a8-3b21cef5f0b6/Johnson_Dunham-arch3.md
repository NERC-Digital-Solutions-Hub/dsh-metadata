Chapter 15 SOILS

- Purpose and scope
  - Detailed upland soil survey of the Moor House Reserve focused on identifying cover types, ecological environments, and soil types.
  - Full soil survey limited by terrain; organic soils (peat) have been extensively studied for post-glacial vegetation history; mineralogy investigated as part of the broader survey.
  - Emphasis on how soils relate to biological habitats and landscape processes; soil mapping supports ecological and management decisions.

- Mapping, scales, and data handling
  - Field maps at standard scales (6 inches to mile and 1 inch to mile) used; publications reduced to 1:63,360 (1 inch to mile) for publication.
  - Large-scale maps (1:63360) depict broad patterns; intermediate-scale mapping (6 inches to mile) captures detailed soil variation in areas of biological interest.
  - A simplified soil map is included; soil associations vs. major soil groups used for classification; soil boundaries can be diffuse near boundaries.

- Soil classification framework
  - British Soil Survey influence: soils grouped into associations (based on parent material) and major soil groups with sub-divisions according to environments of formation.
  - Soil horizons named and interpreted consistently (L, H, F, A, B, C, D horizons; humus and peat layers important where present).
  - Emphasis on describing soil types, their distribution, and their ecological significance rather than simply delineating lithology.

- Major soil divisions present in the Reserve
  - Gleys and peaty-gleys: soils formed under waterlogged conditions; many are overlain by blanket-peat; sub-blanket-peat gleys occur where peat thickness is reduced by erosion.
  - Podzols (including peaty gleyed podzols): soils with horizon development and iron Pan features; commonly occur where drainage is impeded or where peat impacts mineral soil development.
  - Brown earths: relatively immature soils with uniformly colored B horizons; restricted to some steep slopes and considered less extensive.
  - Red-brown limestone soils: clay-loam soils developing on limestone outcrops; feature iron oxide enrichment and, in mature forms, terra rossa-like characteristics; formation linked to underground drainage and limestones as horizons.
  - Skeletal soils: very stony scree soils and thin immature soils over bedrock; important for supporting distinctive vegetation in scree pockets.
  - Soil complexes: areas where two or more soil types repeat over short distances; widespread where blanket-peat and other soils interact (e.g., moor complexes, alluvium–peat complexes, made ground from mine tips).
  - Solifluction soils: high-altitude creep and polygon soils; includes stable solifluction (creep) soils on fell tops and active polygon/periglacial features; some areas form blockfields or stone polygons.

- Peat and blanket-peat dynamics
  - Blanket-peat is the dominant surface cover across much of the Reserve, up to 12 feet thick in places.
  - Peat distribution influences soil type: deep blanket-peat supports peat-gleys; erosion exposes underlying mineral soils (especially on higher slopes).
  - Basins (Upper and Lower Valleys) contain significant peat sequences; valley peat and fen-peat deposits described in related chapters.
  - Present-day peat erosion is actively shaping soil distribution and exposing mineral substrates in parts of the Reserve.

- Mineral soil types in detail
  - Gleys (peaty-gleys): development under persistent or intermittent waterlogging; ochreous mottling common; largely on western escarpment and upper slopes.
  - Sub-blanket-peat gleys: mineral substrata underneath eroding peat; under-lying solum affected by drainage and peat thickness; vegetation patterns (Juncus, Polytrichum) reflect soil conditions.
  - Peaty-gleyed podzols: include hard iron-pan horizons (Bz) with a distinctive, often cemented pan; found in limited patches, typically on upper slopes where peat influence is strong.
  - Podzols (non-peaty and peaty variants): well-drained to imperfectly drained profiles with leached horizons and iron oxide enrichment; various podzol types reflect parent material (Carboniferous rocks, sandstone, limestone outcrops).
  - Brown earths: well-developed below certain limestone outcrops; less extensive and influenced by flushing in base-rich drainage areas.
  - Red-brown limestone soils: develop on level or gently sloping limestone outcrops; initial profiles show leaching and later iron oxide enrichment; mature profiles show strong iron-oxide concentration in A and B horizons due to upward movement of iron-rich solutions from limestone; soil chemistry often linked to high pH pockets and joint-clay infill.
  - Skeletal soils and loam variants: occur over scree, limestone, whin dolerite, and sandstone outcrops; support distinctive limestone- and scree-associated vegetation.
  - Soil complexes and mixed bottom lands: broad zones where peat, alluvium, bare drift, and bedrock intermingle; simplified as “mixed bottom lands” with variable soils depending on local history.
  - Made ground: mine tips and ore tailings forming extensive, highly variable deposits with diverse soil characteristics.

- Solifluction and periglacial features
  - Stable solifluxion soils on flat fell tops with stone extrusion; blockfields and polygonal soils common in high elevations.
  - Active periglacial processes contribute to soil movement, influence soil depth, texture, and surface stability.
  - Creep soils and periglacial polygons interact with vegetation and moisture regimes to shape microhabitats.

- Vegetation and soils interactions
  - Distinct plant communities associated with soil types (e.g., Eriophoretum, Callunetum, Juncus, Polytrichum).
  - Peat depth and drainage influence vegetation distribution, with certain communities occupying gleyed/peaty substrates and others colonizing mineral substrates exposed by peat erosion.

- Notable profiles and examples
  - Red-brown limestone soils: maturation sequence shows progressive iron oxide enrichment and horizon differentiation; profiles illustrate cemented iron-pan horizons and podzol-like features with limestone fragments at depth.
  - Podzol profiles on felltop and limestone outcrops show well-developed humus B horizons and iron pans with reflective color and structure changes across horizons.
  - Immature red-brown limestone soils and associated joint clays demonstrate limestones’ role in solum development via capillary movement and drainage pathways.

- Geological context and landscape drivers
  - Major parent materials include Carboniferous rocks, Great Limestone, Whin Dolerite, and Dun Fell Sandstone; outcrops influence soil types and horizon development.
  - Terrain features (summit ridge, escarpment, slopes) control drainage, peat retention, and soil thickness.
  - Groundwater movement from limestone and differential drainage contribute to soil horizon formation and chemistry, especially in red-brown limestone soils.

- Implications for monitoring and policy-relevant measures
  - Baseline inventory of soil types, thickness of peat, and distribution across elevation and rock type provides a framework for monitoring peat persistence, erosion, and soil moisture regimes.
  - The clear linkage between soil type, drainage status, and vegetation suggests monitoring indicators such as peat depth changes, presence/absence of iron-pan horizons, horizon color/growth of mottling, and shifts in plant communities.
  - Complex soil mosaics (peats, gleys, podzols, skeletal soils) require landscape-scale and site-specific monitoring to detect shifts due to hydrology, erosion, or anthropogenic impacts (e.g., made ground).
  - Data challenges noted (scale limitations, boundary ambiguity, and patchy data on erosion and peat thickness) highlight the need for standardized metadata and consistent data governance when monitoring soil change over time.
