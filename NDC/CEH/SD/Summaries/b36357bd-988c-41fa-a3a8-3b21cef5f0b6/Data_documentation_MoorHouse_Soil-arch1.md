# Soil Map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963)

## Overview
- Polygons representing soil type areas digitized by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology from the 1963 Soil Map of Moor House NNR (Westmorland).
- Mapping categories are described in a table within the document; mapping procedures described in Johnson and Dunham (1963).

## Data Structure
- Columns:
  - SOIL: text description of soil type
  - SYMBOL: numeric code representing soil description
- Resolution: 1:10560 (approximately 6 inches to 1 mile), simplified
- Coordinate system: British National Grid, OSGB1936 projection
- Extent: Great Britain

## Mapping Categories and Codes
- The document lists a comprehensive set of mapped soil types with corresponding codes, including:
  - Mineral soils (e.g., Red brown limestone – symbol 5)
  - Peaty podzol (symbol 43)
  - Peaty gley (symbol 74)
  - Fell top podzol (symbol 53)
  - Brown earth (symbol 6)
  - Blanket bog (symbol 2)
  - Valley bog (symbol 40)
  - Coarse scree (symbol 52)
  - Soil complexes (e.g., Peaty gley-Peaty podzol – symbol 3; Peaty podzol-Brown earth – symbol 72; Solifluction creep – symbol 70; Eroded blanket peat – symbol 77; Mixed bottom lands – symbol 51)
  - Made ground (symbol 1)
  - River Tees (symbol 4)
  - Unsurveyed area (symbol 68)
- Full list of mapped soil types and codes is provided in the document

## Usage Notes for Analysts
- Data are historical soil polygons at a 1:10560 scale (high detail for the period) covering Great Britain.
- Suitable for retrospective analyses, historical habitat assessments, or baseline comparisons with modern soil mapping.
- Consider potential limitations:
  - Older mapping may not reflect current soil conditions or boundaries
  - Scale and digitization methods from 1963; potential alignment or boundary discrepancies when integrating with newer datasets

## Access and Metadata Considerations
- The file details imply a shapefile-like polygon dataset with explicit soil type descriptions and codes.
- Metadata includes coordinate system, projection, resolution, and extent to facilitate integration with GIS workflows.
