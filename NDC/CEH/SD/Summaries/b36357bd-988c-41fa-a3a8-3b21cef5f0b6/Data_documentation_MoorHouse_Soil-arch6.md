# Soil Map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963)

- Overview
  - A polygon dataset representing areas of soil types for Moor House National Nature Reserve, digitized from the 1963 Soil Map.
  - Prepared by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, based on the Soil Survey for the Nature Conservancy (Johnson & Dunham, 1963).

- Data structure and schema
  - Each polygon includes:
    - SOIL: text description of the soil type
    - SYMBOL: numeric code representing the soil description
  - Mapping categories and codes are listed in the accompanying table (page 2 of the document).

- Spatial details
  - Resolution: 1:10560 (6 inches to 1 mile), simplified
  - Coordinate system: British National Grid
  - Projection: Transverse Mercator (OSGB1936)
  - Extent: Great Britain

- Data sources and references
  - Based on: Soil Map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve (1963), Westmorland; Soil Survey for the Nature Conservancy by G.A.L. Johnson (1963)
  - Supporting materials: Chapter 15 in The Geology of Moor House; further reading with Environmental Change Network

- Data use and potential products
  - Supports GIS analysis, cross-dataset integration, and historical soil studies
  - Enables creation of maps, dashboards, and pivot-like analyses to explore soil type distributions
  - Useful for environmental planning, conservation, and policy discussions; facilitates data sharing and potential re-use of outputs with clear coding and descriptions
