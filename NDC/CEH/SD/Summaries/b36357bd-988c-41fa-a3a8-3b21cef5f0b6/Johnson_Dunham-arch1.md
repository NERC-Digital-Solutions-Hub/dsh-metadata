# Chapter 15 SOILS

- Purpose and scope
  - A detailed 6-inch scale soil survey of upland Moor House Reserve to identify cover types and their distribution.
  - Full area soil survey not completed; mineralogy studied; organic soils (peat) described more fully in Chapter 16.
  - Focus on soils in exposed upland areas and their ecological/vegetational contexts; world-wide soil concepts referenced (podzols, gleys, etc.).

- Mapping, data scales, and outputs
  - Field maps use standard 6-inch and other scales; published maps at 1:63360 (1 inch to 1 mile) with about five-acre delineation accuracy.
  - Large-scale plans produced for areas of particular biological interest (Soils enclosure and Greenhole enclosure).
  - Intermediate-scale soil mapping used where detailed ecological information is needed; a simplified soil map (Figure 19) included.
  - Primary mapping outputs: soil type identity, distribution, and boundary delineations (boundaries between soil series are gradual, not sharp).
  - Data quality and usability emphasized: notes on scale limitations, need for integrating parent material, drainage, peat thickness, and horizon data; datasets intended to be discoverable with metadata.

- Soil classification framework
  - Two-tier approach:
    - Soil associations: cartographic units grouping soils by parent material from the same rock; broadly regional.
    - Major soil groups: morphology-based classifications useful across environments.
  - Dominant parent materials: most mineral soils derived from Carboniferous rocks; small areas from whin dolerite and Lower Paleozoic rocks.
  - Major soil groups described in sequence: gleys, podzols, brown earths, red-brown limestone soils, skeletal soils, soil complexes, and solifluxion soils.
  - Horizon terminology (for reference):
    - L, F, H: surface organic layers (L = fresh litter, F = partly decomposed organic matter, H = humus).
    - A, B, C, D: mineral soil horizons with increasing depth and weathering; D horizons reflect parent material or unweathered rock.

- Principal soil types and their characteristics
  - Gleys (peaty and sub-blanket-peat gleys)
    - Form under permanent or intermittent waterlogging; ochreous mottling in many cases.
    - Sub-blanket-peat gleys beneath blanket-peat; peaty-gleys occur on slopes with impeded drainage.
    - Distribution concentrated on western escarpment and upper summit slopes.
    - Typical profile features include peat overlying mineral horizons with gleyed solum.
  - Podzols (including peaty gleyed podzols)
    - Found on upper slopes, often under peat; notable iron-pan in the B/Bl horizon.
    - Profiles show leaching and podzolisation: strong horizon differentiation, light grey leached A/B horizons transitioning to iron-pan B horizon.
    - Peaty gleyed podzols are restricted in extent but occur on upper slopes and plateau features.
  - Brown Earths
    - Uniform B horizon with merging horizons; restricted to steep slopes on western escarpment and summit ridges.
    - Often formed by wet and dry flushing below base-rich outcrops; relatively immature but well developed in places.
  - Red-Brown Limestone Soils
    - Develop on level to gently sloping limestone outcrops; pH around 5.5 or higher; notable terra rossa-like character in some profiles.
    - Iron oxide enrichment creates characteristic orange-brown horizons; iron-pan may be present but not ubiquitous.
    - Formation linked to underground drainage into limestone and seasonal capillary movements during dry periods.
    - Range from immature to mature profiles with pronounced iron oxide concentration in A/B horizons.
  - Skeletal Soils
    - Very stony scree soils over bedrock; include both broad screes (sandstone, limestone, whin dolerite) and pockets below clifftop outcrops.
    - Often support pockets of unique vegetation (Rhacomitrium, Podium spp.); red-brown skeletal rendzinas with high pH near lime pockets.
  - Soil Complexes
    - Areas where two or more soil types are intermingled or change over short distances; common in blanket-peat areas and moor complexes.
    - Examples include blanket-peat complexes, moor complexes (blanket-peat, alluvium, and peaty alluvium), and mixed bottom lands.
    - Also includes man-made Made Ground (mine tips and ore tailings) with highly variable soils.
  - Solifluction Soils
    - Two types on high altitude slopes: stable solifluxion soils (podzols under periglacial influence) and creep/colluvial polygon soils on fell tops.
    - Surface layers of stones created by frost action; active ground movement in spring and during summer rains; polygonal ground common.
    - These soils reflect ongoing periglacial processes and present-day climate interactions.

- Peat and organic soils
  - Organic cover (peat) dominates about 70% of the Reserve; blanket-peat over mineral substrata is pervasive.
  - Blanket-peat depths commonly up to 12 feet in places; peat erosion reveals underlying mineral soils in some areas.
  - Basin-peat deposits occur in valley basins (Upper and Lower Valleys) with substantial peat and fen sequences.
  - Peat thickness and erosion strongly influence soil type distribution and vegetation—detailed peat stratigraphy described in Chapter 16.

- Geological context and soil formation processes
  - Bedrock influences soil types through drainage, D horizons, and mineral supply (Carboniferous rocks, limestone, whin dolerite, sandstone).
  - Underground limestone drainage promotes red-brown limestone soil formation; summer moisture movement concentrates iron oxides in solum.
  - Solifluxion and ground movement (creep, frost heave) shape soils on fell tops and steep outcrops, contributing to horizon development and soil complexes.
  - Phases of post-glacial history (solifluxion, peat deposition, erosion) are integral to current soil distribution.

- Vegetation associations linked to soils
  - Eriophoretum, Callunetum, Juncus and Polytrichum communities commonly associated with specific soil types (peaty gleys, podzols, and mineral soils).
  - Soil moisture regime, drainage, and soil texture strongly influence plant communities and habitat types.

- Data challenges and considerations for analysis
  - Boundaries between soil series are gradual; scale and mapping resolution limit sharp delineations.
  - Complex mosaics (complexes) require multi-layer data (peat thickness, drainage, parent material) for robust analyses.
  - Some soil types are localized (e.g., red-brown limestone soils on specific outcrops) and may be underrepresented in broad-scale maps.
  - The dataset supports integration with ecological, hydrological, and vegetation data to inform habitat management and predictions of soil-vegetation responses to climate and erosion.

- Practical implications for data-driven analysis
  - Use multi-scale maps to capture broad distributions (1:63360) and fine-scale ecological niches (enclosures with 6-inch maps and 1:20-1:5 feature-scale where needed).
  - Model soil-vegetation relationships by linking horizon data (L/F/H, A/B/C) and drainage (gleying, iron-pan presence) to plant communities and habitat types.
  - Track peat thickness and erosion to predict shifts in soil type prevalence and associated ecosystems over time.
  - Incorporate periglacial processes (solifluxion, polygon soils) to understand current soil movement and its impact on data interpretation and habitat stability.
