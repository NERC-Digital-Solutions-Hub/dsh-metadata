# RECOUP-Moor Microbial data: Methodology

## Field Site
- Stalybridge estate (Saddleworth Moor), blanket bog near Manchester, UK.
- Vegetation dominated by Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum.
- June 2018 wildfire affected 18 km2, lasting six weeks, causing large-scale removal of surface vegetation.

## Methods
- Sampling time: October 2018, post-fire.
- Plot design: 10 plots of 10 m x 10 m.
  - 5 plots: shallower (shallow burn) areas.
  - 5 plots: deeper (deep burn) areas.
  - Surface vegetation removed, exposing bare peat.
- Unburned reference and controls:
  - 5 plots on a neighboring unvegetated site within the burn boundary (likely not burned).
  - 5 plots on a neighboring unburned reference site (<2 km from burn site).
- Within each plot:
  - 3 soil cores per plot (≈1 cm diameter, 5 cm depth).
  - Each core divided into top (0–2 cm) and bottom (4–5 cm) layers; samples from the three cores aggregated to one per depth per plot.
- Reference site sampling followed the same procedure and was replicated five times.
- Sample handling:
  - Immediate placement in dry ice on site.
  - Transport to University of Southampton; storage at −20 °C.
- Microbial analysis:
  - DNA extraction with DNeasy PowerSoil kit.
  - Target region: V4 of the 16S rRNA gene.
  - Primers: 515F / 806R.
  - Sequencing platform: Illumina MiSeq.

## Variable key for plot code
- Unique_sample_ID, Unique_plotID: unique identifiers for microbial samples and plots; replicates labeled S1–5 (shallow burn), D1–5 (deep burn), N1–5 (unburned/reference).
- Burn_severity: description of burn severity.
- Sampling_depth: top soil (top) or bottom soil layer (bottom).
- Months_post-fire: approximate months since the fire began.
- ASV sequence: sequence of amplicon sequence variants identified (e.g., TACGAAGGG…).
