# Appendix A: The Meta-Table - Capturing the results of the stages in the methodology and their contribution to the development of the 5 characteristics of the Smart City-Natural City interface

## Overview
- The meta-table traces how literature inputs, an innovation workshop, and iterative discussions produced the final five characteristics of the smart-natural city interface.
- It links thematic inputs and research challenges (Column A) with workshop outputs (Columns B–D) and the collective validation (Column E), culminating in the Final 5 Characteristics (Column F).
- Emphasizes a holistic, city-scale approach (whole-city) that integrates social, technical, and ecological dimensions through place-making, data, and governance.

## Connectivity Space
- Definition: A space where people, digital technology, and nature connect across places to improve performance.
- How inputs shaped it:
  - A: Thematic inputs around connectivity and integration.
  - B–E: Workshop discussions and deep-dives on social connectivity, interconnections of city, people, and nature, and how smart tech can support a natural city.
  - F: Final characterization emphasises connecting people, technology, and nature across the city.
- Data and analytics considerations:
  - Measure the links between social networks, technology platforms, and ecological assets.
  Use dashboards to show interactions among people, places, and nature.
- Data governance and accessibility:
  - Open, interoperable data on connectivity networks; balance with protection of commercial interests.
  - Data sharing to reveal spatial and social interdependencies.

## Visionary Space
- Definition: A space that articulates a bold, shared vision for a liveable city and guides actionable steps.
- How inputs shaped it:
  - B–D: Workshop emphasis on a clear, shared long-term vision and a step-by-step roadmap.
  - E: Deeper-dives validation supports a cohesive vision with practical milestones.
  - F: Final characteristic reflects a future-oriented, co-produced view of the city.
- Data and analytics considerations:
  - Baseline data and targets to define “where we want to get to” and how to measure progress.
  - Co-design of metrics and data requirements with communities and stakeholders.
- Data governance and accessibility:
  - Collaborative metrics development (top-down and bottom-up).
  - Transparent reporting on progress and decisions; open data to inform public debate.

## Place-making Space
- Definition: A space oriented to place-making and place-keeping, integrating green/blue infrastructure with urban design.
- How inputs shaped it:
  - A and F: Emphasis on a place-making approach; “whole city” framing guides integration of capabilities.
  - B–D: Group actions include enabling joint design, open data for infrastructure, and system-wide integration.
  - E: Validation highlights the people-centric, place-keeping emphasis.
- Data and analytics considerations:
  - Spatial data on green/blue infrastructure, health outcomes, and social benefits.
  - Data to support costings, externalities, and the business case for GI investments.
- Data governance and accessibility:
  - Promote co-design of metrics and shared governance across land managers and agencies.
  - Participatory budgeting and community-driven space planning supported by data.

## Smart Citizen-led Space
- Definition: A space where citizens actively access, interpret, and use data to influence decisions in real time.
- How inputs shaped it:
  - A–F: Consistent emphasis on citizen-led data, open data for green/blue infrastructure, and platform-enabled participation.
  - E: Validation notes the importance of connecting people with technology to create common purpose.
- Data and analytics considerations:
  - Platforms that connect citizen science with big data for decision making.
  - Real-time, accessible interfaces for diverse communities to engage with data.
- Data governance and accessibility:
  - Bottom-up data contributions complemented by top-down oversight.
  - Standards for data quality, privacy, and interoperability to enable broad participation.

## Monitoring Space
- Definition: A space in which ICT and smart applications measure, track, and monitor progress toward outcomes.
- How inputs shaped it:
  - A–E: Emphasizes monitoring as a core mechanism to baseline decisions, track progress, and inform adjustments.
  - F: Final characterization ties monitoring to a broader engagement framework and accountability.
- Data and analytics considerations:
  - Continuous measurement of environmental health, green/grey infrastructure performance, and social outcomes.
  - Net Positive standards and other co-designed metrics used to benchmark progress.
- Data governance and accessibility:
  - Horizontal integration platforms for condition monitoring; open access to data where possible.
  - Accountability frameworks to share outcomes and learning across organizations.

## Cross-cutting data and analytic implications
- Net Positive standards: Co-design new metrics that define what “good” looks like beyond minimums.
- Open data with guardrails: Make data about green/blue infrastructure accessible while protecting essential commercial interests.
- Data platforms: Develop shared platforms that integrate environmental, health, mobility, energy, and social data for holistic decision-making.
- Governance and accountability: Balance authority and community voices; establish frameworks for knowledge sharing and collaborative decision-making.
- Data interconnectivity: Link environmental metrics with energy, water, food, housing, public health, transport, waste, and recreation to assess city-wide performance.
- Data emphasis in the design process: Use smart enabling technology early to inform decisions, educate, and set baselines; ensure data informs challenges, options, and public debate.
- Outcome-focused narrative: Use the five characteristics to steer place-making and governance toward healthier, more equitable, and more sustainable urban systems.

## Analytical takeaways for environmental analysts
- The meta-table provides a structured pathway from literature to actionable five-dimensional characteristics, grounding environmental analytics in social, economic, and governance contexts.
- To monitor the Smart City-Natural City interface, analysts should:
  - Develop and harmonize data schemas across connectivity, vision, place-making, citizen-led, and monitoring spaces.
  - Create open data policies that balance public value with commercial considerations.
  - Establish Net Positive metrics and co-design them with communities and authorities.
  - Build integrated dashboards that combine ecological data with health, mobility, energy, and social indicators.
  - Facilitate data-sharing agreements and governance mechanisms that enable accountability and joint action across multiple stakeholders.
  - Support citizen engagement through platforms that translate data into tangible decisions and actions in real time.
