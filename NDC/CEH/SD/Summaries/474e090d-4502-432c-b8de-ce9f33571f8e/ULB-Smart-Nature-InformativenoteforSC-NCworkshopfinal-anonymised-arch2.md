# Introduction

- The 21st century is increasingly urban, with 54% of the world’s population in cities (rising to 66% by 2050). This drives concerns about urban sustainability and citizen health.
- The UK Urban Living Partnership cofunded a project in five cities (including Birmingham) to co-produce practical solutions for sustainable urban growth, focusing on a whole-city approach that integrates infrastructure, environment, smart cities, and big urban data.
- Urban Living Birmingham (ULB) identified resilience challenges in Birmingham’s environment, notably a health–connectivity–energy nexus, and a mismatch between the natural/urban form and resident characteristics.
- Birmingham promotes a Green Living Spaces Plan and positioning as the UK’s first Biophilic City, with active mapping of ecosystem services; ULB aims to embed environment and wellbeing into future city strategies.

## The value of green and the rise of smart

- There is growing evidence that green-blue infrastructure (GBI) enhances health and wellbeing; the so-called G-effect recognizes ecosystem services as a tool to mitigate negative urban health impacts.
- Birmingham is pursuing a Smart City agenda via the Smart City Roadmap (SCR, 2014) to use digital tech to improve infrastructure, services, mobility, and low-carbon outcomes, with a target of joined-up, citizen-centered service delivery.
- Smart city and natural city visions are currently only loosely integrated; both are described as “transition discourses” with multiple possible futures, suggesting potential synergy through technology and ecosystem services to support renewable energy, inclusive growth, and balance between equity and efficiency.

## People, opportunities and challenges for the smart–nature interface

- Green and blue spaces account for about 14% of UK urban space, with substantial variability across European cities; densification often reduces this resource.
- Management challenges include the structure and dynamics of green space, spatial constraints on ecosystem flows, new and complex flows, distribution of ecosystem services, and “wicked” governance problems.
- Effective management requires understanding the city as a social–ecological system; governance is complex due to multiple land managers, conflicting approaches, and gaps between perceptions and reality.
- A range of tools supports decision-making: high-resolution remote sensing, landscape ecology concepts, and systematic conservation planning, enabling collaboration between local authorities and other actors.

## Infrastructure and a systems perspective

- Conventional urban planning often treats health, water, housing, green infrastructure, biodiversity, and climate adaptation in silos; a social–ecological systems lens promotes integrated, multisectoral thinking for sustainability.
- Infrastructure should be reconceived as holistic systems providing energy, water, food, housing, transport, communication, waste management, and recreation—supporting well-being and economic development.
- A shift from government to governance is needed, with a broader strategic view of interconnected systems and scales.
- Eight key principles for reconnecting infrastructure within social–ecological urban systems:
  1. Basic infrastructure access for all.
  2. Dynamic multisector and multiscalar health improvements with equity considerations.
  3. Focus on urban form and multisector synergies for resource efficiency.
  4. Recognize diverse resource-efficiency strategies across city types.
  5. Integrate high- and vernacular technologies; value local knowledge.
  6. Apply transboundary systems analysis to localized vs. larger-scale decisions.
  7. Recognize coevolution of infrastructures and institutions.
  8. Promote capacity and transparent governance across sectors and scales.
- The SMART-Natural interface proposes integrated, holistic interventions, though achieving this requires cultural change, investment in social capital, and capacity-building. Financial and political constraints in Birmingham and other cities pose barriers, but there are opportunities as investment shifts toward digitally connected “smart infrastructure.”
- Industry signals: private sector interest in digitally enabling future infrastructure (e.g., roads connected to data for autonomous vehicles) highlights the coevolution of grey (built) and green (natural) city infrastructure as a key opportunity.

## Starting-off point and implications for data-driven monitoring

- To realise the smart–natural integration, data must support cross-sector, multi-scale understanding of urban systems and infrastructure performance.
- Opportunities for data-driven monitoring include leveraging:
  - Green/blue infrastructure mapping and ecosystem service indicators
  - Health, mobility, energy and climate performance data
  - High-resolution remote sensing and landscape ecology analytics
  - Governance and multi-actor collaboration data to track cross-sector coordination
- Barriers include cultural change, governance fragmentation, data sharing across sectors, and the need for capacity-building to mainstream integrated monitoring approaches.

## Closing note

- The document frames Birmingham as a case for integrating green infrastructure with smart city principles, using a systems perspective to guide transformative, data-driven urban planning and governance aligned with wellbeing and sustainability goals.
