# Urban Living Birmingham: SMART-Natural interface

- Context and aim
  - Rapid urbanization drives concerns about city sustainability and citizen health.
  - Urban Living Birmingham (ULB) part of a UK-wide collaboration to co-produce and test practical solutions for sustainable urban growth across cities, with a focus on a whole-city approach integrating infrastructure, environment, and services.
  - Birmingham’s diagnosis highlights a health-and-well-being nexus at the center of connectivity, economy, and energy, and a need to link green infrastructure benefits with future urban development.
  - The city hosts Green Living Spaces Plan (GLSP) and positions itself as a Biophilic City, aiming to embed environmental benefits into integrated, citizen-centered delivery. It is also pursuing Smart City ambitions via the Smart City Roadmap (SCR) to use digital tech to improve infrastructure, services, and equity.

- The value of green, blue infrastructure and the rise of smart
  - Growing evidence that green/blue infrastructure (GBI) enhances health and well-being (the G-effect); natural and blue spaces can mitigate negative urban health effects.
  - Smart City efforts focus on using data and IT to improve urban performance, monitor and optimize infrastructure, and enable cross-sector collaboration.
  - A gap exists: smart and natural city visions are often not well integrated, leading to a fragmented approach. The document frames this as a transition between two discourses rather than a single solution.
  - Potential synergy exists in leveraging technology and ecosystem services to foster renewable energy, low-carbon cities, and inclusive growth while maintaining social equity.

- People, opportunities and challenges for the smart-nature interface
  - Urban green/blue space provision varies widely (GBI accounts for 14% of UK urban space; 1.9–46% in other European cities), with densification reducing access and quality.
  - Management challenges include spatial/temporal dynamics of green space, flows of ecosystem services, governance complexity with many land managers, and misalignment between perceptions and reality.
  - A suite of tools supports solution-finding, including high-resolution remote sensing, landscape ecology concepts, and systematic conservation planning, suggesting opportunities for collaboration between local authorities and others in developing a smart city.

- Infrastructure and a systems perspective
  - Urban planning tends to diagnose and treat challenges within sectoral silos, leading to inefficiency and policy myopia.
  - A social-ecological systems perspective reframes urban challenges as interdependent, multisectoral, multiscalar problems, requiring a move toward governance that views cities as integrated social-ecological-infrastructural systems.
  - Reframing infrastructure as a holistic set of critical systems (energy, water, housing, transport, etc.) enables better integration of green and grey city components.
  - Eight key principles (adapted from Ramaswani et al.) to reconnect infrastructure within social-ecological systems:
    1) Provide basic infrastructure with universal access.
    2) Pursue dynamic multisector health improvements with equity considerations.
    3) Focus on urban form and multisector synergies for resource efficiency.
    4) Recognize diverse resource-efficiency strategies across city types.
    5) Integrate high- and vernacular technologies; incorporate local knowledge and systems thinking.
    6) Apply transboundary systems analysis to local vs. larger-scale decisions.
    7) Recognize coevolution of infrastructures and institutions.
    8) Create capacity and transparent governance across sectors and scales.
  - The SMART-Natural interface is presented as an opportunity for holistic interventions, but acknowledges the cultural shift, investment in social capital, and capacity-building required; barriers include financial and political constraints, data sharing concerns, and the need for mainstreaming changes.

- Implications for monitoring and governance (inferred)
  - For authors of monitoring frameworks, the document implies a need to track:
    - Health and well-being outcomes linked to green/blue infrastructure.
    - Extent, quality, and accessibility of GBI and ecosystem services.
    - Integration and co-delivery of smart-city initiatives with natural infrastructure.
    - Cross-sector collaboration, governance structures, and data-sharing practices.
    - Data quality, metadata, timeliness, openness, and standards to avoid silos.
  - A shift toward systems-level indicators that capture multisector interdependencies and the impact of infrastructure governance on health, equity, and resilience.

- Opportunities, barriers and forward look
  - The private sector’s recognition of opportunities in digitally connected, smart infrastructure supports a shift in investment toward integrated smart-natural solutions.
  - Realizing the opportunity requires addressing data access barriers, improving metadata, easing data transformation, and implementing robust data governance.
  - The text signals a practical pathway: harness digital infrastructure to support a holistic, connected city that integrates health, environment, and urban form through coordinated governance and long-term investment.
