# Urban Living Birmingham

- Context and aims
  - The 21st century is the city century: over half the world’s population is urban, rising toward 66% by 2050.
  - The Urban Living Project (2015) cofunded by UK Research Councils and Innovate UK spans 5 cities, including Birmingham, to co-produce and test practical solutions for sustainable urban growth and resilient, inclusive city systems.
  - Urban Living Birmingham (ULB) seeks a holistic, “whole city” approach, integrating infrastructure, environment, smart city initiatives, big urban data, and citizen involvement to address health, well-being, and resilience.

- Birmingham’s diagnosis and challenges
  - Identify a central health-and-well-being nexus embedded in connectivity, economy, and energy.
  - Challenges include environmental resilience for a low-energy, low-carbon future and a disconnect between the natural environment and resident demographics.
  - Birmingham promotes green identity (Green Living Spaces Plan; “Biophilic City”) and active ecosystem service mapping, yet integration with smart-city aims is limited.

- The value of green and the rise of smart
  - Substantial evidence links green and blue infrastructure (GBI) to health and well-being benefits in cities (the G-effect).
  - GBI can mitigate adverse health effects of urbanization when properly implemented.
  - Smart City Roadmap (SCR) emphasizes using digital tech to enhance infrastructure capacity, address health inequalities, improve mobility, and pursue low-carbon goals.
  - The two visions—green/natural city and smart city—are increasingly seen as complementary but remain poorly integrated, reflecting “transition discourses” with multiple viable paths rather than a single solution.

- People, opportunities and challenges for the smart-nature interface
  - Urban expansion increases the importance of local ecosystem goods and services; green/blue spaces vary widely in coverage (UK ~14% of urban space; other European cities 1.9–46%), with densification risking net losses.
  - Governance is complex due to multiple land managers, competing priorities, and misalignment between perceptions and realities of urban landscapes.
  - Tools to aid solutions include high-resolution remote sensing, landscape ecology, and systematic conservation planning.
  - There is clear potential for collaboration between local authorities and other actors to develop and manage the smart city in tandem with ecological planning.

- Infrastructure and a systems perspective
  - Urban planning often remains siloed by sector (health, water, housing, economy, green infrastructure, biodiversity, climate).
  - A social-ecological-infrastructural systems view reframes city challenges as interdependent, promoting multisectoral, multiscalar thinking.
  - Redefining infrastructure: energy, water, housing, transportation, communication, waste management, and recreation as part of a holistic system supporting well-being and development.
  - Eight guiding principles to reconnect urban infrastructure within social-ecological systems:
    1) Focus on providing basic infrastructure with access for all.
    2) Pursue dynamic multisector and multiscalar urban health improvements, with attention to inequities.
    3) Focus on urban form and multisector synergies for resource efficiency.
    4) Recognize diverse strategies for resource efficiency in different city types.
    5) Integrate high- and vernacular technologies; value local knowledge and system-level configurations.
    6) Apply transboundary systems analysis to inform decisions about localized versus larger-scale infrastructure.
    7) Recognize coevolution of infrastructures and institutions.
    8) Create capacity and transparent infrastructure governance across sectors and scales.

- A starting-off point and the path forward
  - The SMART-Natural interface is the focal point for innovative, holistic interventions; achieving it requires culture change and investment in social capital and capacity building.
  - Financial and political constraints in Birmingham and other major cities challenge traditional urban-futures planning, yet there is an opportunity in shifting investment toward digitally connected, smart infrastructure.
  - Industry voices (e.g., Costain’s Andrew Wyllie) signal a move toward digitally enabled, information-rich infrastructure for the future (e.g., roads prepared for autonomous vehicles).
  - The approach envisions coevolution of grey (traditional) and green city infrastructure as a key opportunity, not to be missed.

- Data, evidence and publication note
  - The document draws on a literature review and aims to inform ULB outputs and publications.
  - It emphasizes data-driven, cross-sector analysis to support integrated policy and practical decisions in urban systems.
