# Appendix A: The Meta-Table - Capturing the results of the stages in the methodology and their contribution to the development of the 5 characteristics of the Smart City-Natural City interface

- The meta-table traces how literature inputs, workshop discussions, and deeper-dive validations feed into the final five characteristics of the smart-natural city interface.
- It uses columns A–E to capture four thematic inputs and workshop-derived outputs (discussion points, actionable suggestions, collected summaries, and collective validation), and column F to present the Final 5 characteristics.
- The five characteristics are:
  - Connectivity Space: where people, digital technology, and nature connect to improve performance; emphasizes nature as a core concern and the need for integrated IT approaches and co-produced terminology.
  - Visionary Space: a bold, shared vision for a liveable city with outcome-focused data and steps; stresses co-designed metrics (including Net Positive standards) and a staged pathway from data to action.
  - Place-making Space: a whole-city, place-keeping orientation that fosters community-driven, networked green/blue infrastructure and governance that supports integrated outcomes.
  - Smart Citizen-led Space: a space enabling citizen access to data and co-design of decisions; emphasizes open data, bottom-up engagement, and data-enabled empowerment of communities.
  - Monitoring Space: a space where ICT and smart applications measure, track, and monitor progress; focuses on baselines, decision-support data, and accountability through data sharing.

- Key insights for data governance in relation to the five characteristics:
  - Data interoperability and integration: addressing the move from siloed systems to a holistic city data ecosystem; standardize data formats and metadata to support cross-domain analysis (infrastructure, health, environment, transport, etc.).
  - Data quality and transformation: ongoing quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation of incoming datasets before sharing or use.
  - Data availability and restrictions: manage disclosure risks, proprietary concerns, embargoes, and balance open data with commercial or security considerations.
  - Metadata and provenance: document inputs, workshop discussions, and validation steps to ensure traceability from literature to final characteristics.
  - Data sharing and governance: establish open data where appropriate (e.g., blue/green infrastructure data) while protecting sensitive or commercially valuable information; foster a framework that supports collaborative accountability across organizations.
  - Metrics and evaluation: co-design and adopt new metrics (e.g., Net Positive standards) for city challenges/outcomes, enabling consistent measurement across the five spaces.
  - Stakeholder engagement: align data practices with citizen needs and governance structures; support an engagement framework that enables community-driven data collection and use.

- Practical data-management actions implied by the meta-table:
  - Upload and catalogue datasets in relevant portals; maintain clear metadata and data lineage.
  - Document work performed on datasets and the rationale behind transformations or classifications.
  - Develop and maintain a shared data dictionary and interoperability standards to support the five characteristics.
  - Implement monitoring dashboards and reporting tools to track progress against the Net Positive metrics and other agreed outcomes.
  - Facilitate co-design of data requirements and metrics with both authorities and communities to sustain buy-in and accountability.
