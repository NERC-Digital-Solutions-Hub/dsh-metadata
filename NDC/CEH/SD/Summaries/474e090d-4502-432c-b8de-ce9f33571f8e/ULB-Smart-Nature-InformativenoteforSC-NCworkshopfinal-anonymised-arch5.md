# Urban Living Birmingham: Smart-Natural interface

- Aims and context
  - Rapid urbanization: over half the world’s population in cities, rising to two-thirds by 2050.
  - UK Urban Living Partnership (2015) with Birmingham as a testbed to co-produce practical, sustainable urban growth solutions.
  - Aims to integrate smart city approaches with green/blue infrastructure to support health, well-being, resilience, and inclusive growth.

- Core concepts for data stewardship
  - Data-driven integration across sectors (infrastructure, environment, health, mobility, economy) to support joined-up service delivery.
  - Emphasis on ecosystem services and green infrastructure data as central to decision-making.
  - Movement from siloed planning to a systems perspective: cities as social-ecological-infrastructural systems requiring cross-cutting governance and data.

- Data sources and data needs
  - Green/blue infrastructure data (extent, condition, connectivity) and ecosystem services.
  - High-resolution data tools: remote sensing, landscape ecology frameworks, and planning models.
  - City-scale planning and governance data, including Smart City Roadmap and Green Living Spaces Plan (GLSP).

- Data governance, sharing, and interoperability
  - Need for standardization across many systems and formats, with robust metadata and documentation.
  - Timely data delivery from multiple stakeholders (public sector, private sector, communities) and governance of embargoes and proprietary data.
  - Platform-level sharing: publish datasets to portals and catalogue data holdings; maintain update mechanisms.

- Infrastructure and governance implications
  - Advocates a holistic, multisector, multiscalar view of infrastructure (energy, water, housing, mobility, ICT, recreation) to enable better service delivery and resilience.
  - Eight principles for integrating infrastructure within social-ecological systems, emphasizing inclusivity, resource efficiency, local knowledge, and transparent governance.
  - Recognition that culture change, capacity building, and mainstreaming efforts are required to realise smart-natural interventions.

- Practical implications for data stewards
  - Provide guidance and tools to data creators to meet standards (accuracy, metadata, format).
  - Validate and transform incoming datasets; document work performed on datasets.
  - Identify data availability, limitations, and risks (disclosure, embargoes, proprietary issues) and implement update workflows.
  - Ensure datasets support cross-sector decision-making and are discoverable via appropriate portals.

- Challenges and opportunities
  - Challenges: incomplete understanding of user needs, timely data delivery, inconsistent metadata, diverse systems/formats, large data transfers, and outdated databases needing bespoke solutions.
  - Opportunities: leveraging digital infrastructure investment and cross-disciplinary collaboration to create a more integrated, low-carbon, smart city ecosystem.

- End note
  - The note emphasizes the potential of a Smart-Natural interface to generate holistic, sustainable urban interventions, with private sector interest and a shift toward digitally connected smart infrastructure.
