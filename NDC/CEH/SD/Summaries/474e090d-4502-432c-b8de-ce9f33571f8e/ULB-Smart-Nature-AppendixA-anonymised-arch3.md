# Appendix A: The Meta-Table - Capturing the results of the stages in the methodology and their contribution to the development of the 5 characteristics of the Smart City-Natural City interface

## Overview
- Describes how literature review inputs, workshop discussions, and deeper-dive validation led to the development of five characteristics for the Smart City-Natural City interface.
- Uses a meta-table format with columns A–F to trace inputs (A: thematic inputs and challenges) through workshop outputs (B–D) and deeper validation (E) to the final five characteristics (F).
- Aims to integrate green infrastructure (GI) with smart-city discourse to improve health, wellbeing, equity, and city performance.
- Emphasises place-making, cross-silo collaboration, open data, and co-designed metrics (notably Net Positive standards).
- Grounded in a Birmingham study, highlighting governance, data, and community engagement as central themes.

## The 5 Characteristics (Final Framework)
- The Final 5 Characteristics are described across the meta-table as distinct but interrelated spaces that together define the Smart City-Natural City interface:

1) Connectivity Space
- A space where people, digital technology, and nature connect across places to improve performance.
- Focuses on breaking silos, integrating environment thinking into planning, and using IT/sensors to smarter-manage grey, blue, and green infrastructure.
- Emphasises social connectivity, cross-cutting interdependencies of city, people, and nature, and exploring how smart systems can support a natural city.

2) Visionary Space
- Requires a bold, shared vision of the liveable city and the steps needed to reach it.
- Stresses co-design of metrics and data needs, moving beyond data overload to targeted data collection.
- Advocates new metrics (Net Positive standards) co-created from top and bottom, and clear data governance to track progress.

3) Place-making Space
- Focuses on a whole-city approach that integrates place-making and place-keeping.
- Highlights enabling community-driven spaces, networked across the city, and the governance/investment models to sustain them.
- Encourages integrating GI with urban infrastructure and ensuring governance supports community ideas, health outcomes, and urban development.

4) Smart Citizen-led Space
- Centers on citizen access to data and real-time influence over decisions.
- Supports co-design, bottom-up data collection, and open data to empower communities.
- Encourages connecting citizen-led science with big data to inform decision making, and using smart tech to engage diverse urban populations.

5) Monitoring Space
- Uses ICT and smart applications to measure, track, and monitor progress against the envisioned outcomes.
- Provides baselines for decision-making, supports self-managed or community-administered spaces, and promotes data openness.
- Emphasises governance, accountability, and the iterative use of data to adapt policies and practices.

## Key Components and Mechanisms
- Data and metrics
  - Net Positive standards: a proposed agreed set of metrics reflecting positive outcomes beyond minimum standards.
  - Co-design of metrics from top-down leadership and bottom-up communities.
  - Open data policies for Blue & Green Infrastructure, balancing public access with commercial considerations.
  - Metrics should address health, wellbeing, equity, biodiversity, climate change, mobility, and economic benefits.

- Data governance and sharing
  - Importance of metadata quality and standardization; making datasets transparent while respecting data owners.
  - Need for governance processes to store, share, and maintain data over time.
  - Balance between openness and protecting commercial interests where relevant.

- Stakeholder engagement
  - Workshop-driven insights and deeper-dives used to validate the characteristics.
  - Emphasis on joining up actors across time and place; co-produced solutions; reducing ‘us’ vs ‘them’ mentalities.
  - Recognition of challenges such as silos, bureaucratic barriers, and the need to democratize data and decisions.

- Implementation context
  - Grounded in a Birmingham case study, illustrating practical governance, community dynamics, and the role of a strategic authority.
  - Describes an overall “Engagement Framework” for changing how a city authority operates by embedding the five spaces into policy and practice.
  - Highlights potential for economic and social benefits through smarter, greener urban design and public engagement.

## Implications for Monitoring Framework Authors
- The meta-table provides a structured approach to tracing how inputs translate into a coherent monitoring framework comprising five interdependent spaces.
- It supports iterative, participatory development of indicators that are meaningful to both policymakers and communities.
- It underscores the need for:
  - Integrated measurement that accounts for health, environment, social equity, and urban performance.
  - Flexible, co-designed metrics that can adapt as city contexts evolve.
  - Transparent data governance and open data where feasible to enable scrutiny, replication, and public trust.
  - A governance model that aligns authority with community capability, enabling ongoing learning and improvement.
