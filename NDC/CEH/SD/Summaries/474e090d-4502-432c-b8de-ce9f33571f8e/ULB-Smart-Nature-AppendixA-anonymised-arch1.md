# Appendix A: The Meta-Table - Capturing the results of the stages in the methodology and their contribution to the development of the 5 characteristics of the Smart City-Natural City interface

- Purpose and structure
  - A meta-table that tracks how literature inputs, an innovation workshop, and deeper dives contributed to and validated five characteristics of the Smart City-Natural City interface.
  - Columns A–E present thematic inputs, workshop discussion points, action suggestions, collected summaries, and deeper-dive validations; Column F presents the Final 5 characteristics.
  - Demonstrates how comments and narratives evolved to validate each characteristic and shows associations across the stages.

- The five characteristics (final outputs)
  - Connectivity Space
  - Visionary Space
  - Place-making Space
  - Smart Citizen-led Space
  - Monitoring Space
  - Each characteristic reflects a dimension where people, technology, and nature are connected to support a holistic, liveable, and data-informed city.

- Key insights by characteristic
  - Connectivity Space
    - People, digital technology, and nature connect across places to improve city performance.
    - Nature remains a core concern; aim to integrate environment thinking into big decisions from the start (master planning).
    - Emphasizes reducing silo thinking, using shared terminology, and co-produced solutions rather than delivering “to” communities.
    - Highlights the role of IT approaches, sensors, and platforms to manage grey, blue, and green infrastructure in an integrated way.
  - Visionary Space
    - Requires a clear, bold, shared city vision that transcends silos (economic, social, environmental).
    - Use interactive technology to engage citizens and evolve the smart city with real-time input.
    - Design steps and data needs to reach the vision, including identifying data to collect and developing Net Positive metrics.
    - Promotes co-design of data and metrics from both top and bottom levels to build buy-in and governance around the vision.
  - Place-making Space
    - Emphasizes place-based networks and integration of green/blue infrastructure into a holistic city narrative.
    - Governance, devolution, and community-driven spaces are central; aim to network spaces across the city for greater collective impact.
    - Data-informed design and ongoing evaluation to ensure health, equality, and social benefits are embedded.
    - Recognizes the value of Green Infrastructure within a smart-city context and the need to link with energy, water, food, housing, transport, and public services.
  - Smart Citizen-led Space
    - Open data and citizen-led science connected with big data to inform decision making.
    - Bottom-up engagement complemented by top-down co-design to empower communities to innovate and deliver outcomes.
    - Aims to quantify and communicate benefits of data-driven decisions to citizens, including facilitating community action and co-management.
    - Emphasizes inclusive participation, new metrics, and accessible information to broaden involvement beyond traditional actors.
  - Monitoring Space
    - ICT and smart applications are used to measure, track, and monitor progress against defined outcomes.
    - Establish baseline data, dashboards, and open data where feasible to support accountability and decision-making.
    - Supports learning about what works, enabling iterative improvements and transparent reporting to stakeholders.

- Cross-cutting themes and mechanisms
  - Net Positive standards and new metrics
    - Move beyond minimum standards toward Net Positive outcomes, co-designed at multiple levels to reflect both top-down and bottom-up perspectives.
  - Data openness balanced with safeguarding interests
    - Open data for green and blue infrastructure is valued, with attention to protecting commercial interests where appropriate.
  - Green Infrastructure and smart city integration
    - Strong emphasis on integrating natural capital and GI with smart-city technologies to deliver multiple benefits for health, well-being, and economic vitality.
  - Governance and power dynamics
    - Addresses tensions between authority and community groups; promotes more participatory governance, devolved management, and accountable collaboration.
  - Capacity-building and experimentation
    - Encourages platforms, tools, and metrics that enable communities to act, co-design solutions, and co-manage spaces.
  - Data as a decision-enabler
    - Data and smart technologies are positioned as enabling tools to inform choices, engage citizens, and demonstrate the value of green and smart investments.

- How the meta-table supports analysts
  - Provides a traceable map from theoretical inputs to actionable characteristics.
  - Documents the evolution of ideas through workshop discussions, stakeholder feedback, and deeper-dives.
  - Emphasizes data-driven, participatory, and multi-scalar approaches to designing a Smart City-Natural City interface.
