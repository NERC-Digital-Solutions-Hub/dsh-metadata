# Introduction

- Global urbanization context and the Urban Living Birmingham (ULB) initiative
  - More than half of the world’s population now in cities; expectation to rise to 66% by 2050.
  - The ULB partnership brings together research, local government, service delivery, communities and business in Birmingham to co-produce practical, data-informed solutions for sustainable urban growth with a whole-city perspective.

- Data and evidence basis for green, blue, and smart city agendas
  - Green and blue infrastructure (GBI) are linked to better health and well-being; need data to monitor and leverage ecosystem services.
  - Birmingham pursues a Smart City strategy (Smart City Roadmap, 2014) to use digital technologies to boost infrastructure efficiency, mobility, health equity, and low-carbon goals.
  - The smart city and the natural city are advancing separately; there is a need for integrating data across these visions to foster inclusive, sustainable growth.

- Opportunities and challenges of the smart-nature interface
  - GBI provision is uneven (UK green space ~14% of urban space; European variability 1.9–46%), with densification risking loss of ecological resources.
  - Ecosystem services are influenced by spatial constraints, temporal dynamics, and governance complexity, requiring sophisticated data-led planning.
  - A broad set of tools (remote sensing, landscape ecology, conservation planning) supports solution discovery, highlighting opportunities for cross-sector data collaboration between local authorities and other actors.

- Infrastructure and systems thinking for urban data
  - Traditional planning tends to silo health, water, housing, green infrastructure, biodiversity, and climate agendas; a social-ecological-infrastructural systems view is needed.
  - Infrastructure should be reconceived as cross-cutting systems providing energy, water, housing, transport, waste management, and recreation, all tied to well-being and economic development.
  - Eight guiding principles emphasize equity, multisector and multiscalar health improvements, resource efficiency, local knowledge, transboundary analysis, coevolution of infrastructures and institutions, and transparent governance.
  - Implementing a SMART-Natural interface requires culture change, investment in social capital, and careful mainstreaming, with recognition of financial and political constraints in cities like Birmingham.

- Data-focused implications and practical pathways
  - To unlock these opportunities, data must support integrated decision-making across sectors and scales, linking environmental services with health, mobility, climate, and governance outcomes.
  - The potential exists for data-driven, citizen-focused service delivery and for building interoperable data platforms that enable co-production of solutions, monitoring of ecosystem services, and evaluation of policy interventions.
  - The shift toward digitally connected, smart infrastructure emphasizes the need to collect, standardize, and share data across grey (built) and green (natural) infrastructure to enable resilient, low-carbon urban development.
