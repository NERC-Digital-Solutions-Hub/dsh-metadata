# NERC Data Repository - Supporting Information

## Overview
- Describes multi-disciplinary, anonymised expert inputs contributing to the research on smart-natural city interfaces and urban governance.
- Documents the outputs from the Innovation Workshop held in Birmingham, UK (12 September 2017) and subsequent group discussions and conversations (Sept–Nov 2017).
- Supports the integration of urban futures discourses using Birmingham as a case study.

## Data content in the repository
- Record of group/table outputs from the Innovation Workshop.
- Photographs of collective "stickies" contributions from the workshop.
- Original transcripts of semi-structured interviews.
- Records of group telephone or meeting conversations.
- “Work in progress” collations of comments for contributors and co-authors.

## Study and authors
- Research aimed at identifying new ways to integrate urban futures discourses and shaping the Smart City – Natural City interface.
- Authors/researchers: Mike Grace and Prof. David Proverbs (Birmingham City University); Prof. Alister Scott (Northumbria University); Prof. Jonathan Sadler (University of Birmingham); Nick Grayson (Birmingham City Council).

## Funding and timeline
- Supported by Research Councils UK (RCUK) and Innovate UK as part of the Urban Living Partnership (grant EP/P002021/1), 2015–2018.
- Urban Living Birmingham project identified as one of five ULP cities.

## Data provenance and accessibility
- Transcripts of expert inputs used to inform the integration of urban futures discourses.
- Data include transcripts, workshop outputs, and project communications intended to be shared with contributors and co-authors.
- Anonymisation applied to expert inputs where described.
- Images document data capture activities by expert contributors.

## Relevance to environmental analytics
- Demonstrates a rigorous, multi-source data collection process for monitoring and shaping urban environmental governance and planning.
- Highlights standardised methods for compiling, storing, and sharing qualitative data (workshop outputs, transcripts, discussions).
- Emphasizes the value of integrating diverse datasets (qualitative inputs, workshop records, visual artefacts) beyond single-use data.
- Addresses data accessibility and provenance to enable scrutiny, replication, and secondary analysis within environmental and urban policy contexts.
