# NERC Data Repository - Supporting Information

## Overview
- Describes data availability for the manuscript and the multi-disciplinary, anonymised expert inputs.
- Documents a meta-table that organises outputs from the Innovation Workshop held in Birmingham, UK on 12 September 2017, plus subsequent group discussions and individual or collective deeper-dive conversations (Sept–Nov 2017).
- Outlines the contents of the data depository and how the transcripts informed new approaches to integrating urban futures discourses, concentrating on shaping the Smart City - Natural City interface with Birmingham as a case study.

## Data in the Depository
- Records of group or table outputs from the Innovation Workshop.
- Photographs of collective “stickies” contributions from the workshop.
- Original transcript records of semi-structured interview conversations.
- Records of group telephone or meeting conversations.
- Work-in-progress collations of comments shared with contributors and co-authors.

## Purpose and Usage
- Transcripts and outputs were used to identify new ways of integrating urban futures discourses, particularly for the Smart City - Natural City interface.
- Uses Birmingham, UK as a central case study to explore and re-imagine urban planning and governance.

## People and Institutions
- Researchers: Mike Grace and Prof. David Proverbs (Birmingham City University); Prof. Alister Scott (Northumbria University); Prof. Jonathan Sadler (University of Birmingham); Nick Grayson (Birmingham City Council).
- Funding and support: Research Councils UK (RCUK) and Innovate UK, as part of the Urban Living Partnership (grant EP/P002021/1), 2015–2018; Urban Living Birmingham project (one of five ULP cities).

## Data Scope and Format
- Includes qualitative data types: workshop outputs, transcripts, interview records, and meeting records; plus visual data: photographs of workshop contributions.
- Anonymised expert inputs are described to support reproducibility and further analysis.

## Relevance for GIS Specialists
- Provides rich, qualitative inputs on urban futures discourses that can inform GIS-based data products, spatial governance concepts, and map-based representations of smart-natural city interfaces.
- Supports event-driven and participatory data collection approaches that can be mapped or spatially coded for policy and planning audiences.
- Demonstrates data management practices for aggregating multi-source, cross-institutional inputs to shape spatial planning narratives in Birmingham and similar urban contexts.
