# Appendix A: The Meta-Table - Capturing the results of the stages in the methodology and their contribution to the development of the 5 characteristics of the Smart City-Natural City interface

- The meta-table links literature inputs and workshop outputs to the development of five interrelated characteristics that describe the Smart City–Natural City interface.
- Structure:
  - Column A: The four thematic inputs and research challenges.
  - Columns B–D: Workshop group discussion points, suggestions for action, and collected summary points.
  - Column E: Validation by deeper dives (collective responses).
  - Column F: Final five characteristics.

- How the five characteristics were developed:
  - From a “whole city” perspective focused on place-making and place-keeping.
  - Through iterative synthesis of theoretical inputs, stakeholder discussions, and deeper-dive validations.

- The five final characteristics (summary):
  1) A Connectivity Space
     - A space where people, digital technology, and nature connect across places to improve performance.
     - Emphasises integrating environment thinking into master planning; moving beyond silos; shared terminology; co-produced solutions.
     - Questions how smart technology and systems can connect the city’s people, nature, and infrastructure (e.g., Birmingham’s grey, blue, and green infrastructure).
  2) A Visionary Space
     - A bold, shared vision for the liveable city, with steps and data needed to reach the goal.
     - Emphasises planning the whole city and identifying the data required at each step instead of being overwhelmed by data.
     - Advocates new, co-designed metrics (Net Positive standards) and a governance model that combines top-down and bottom-up input; uses smart data to engage citizens and inform decisions.
  3) A Place-making and Place-keeping Space
     - Focuses on integrating green/blue infrastructure with urban spaces to deliver health, environmental, social, and economic benefits.
     - Calls for governance that devolves management to communities, networks spaces across the city, and treats BCC (city authority) as a strategic enabler.
     - Highlights the need to connect green infrastructure with energy, water, housing, health, employment, transport, and other critical systems.
  4) A Smart, Citizen-led Space
     - Centers on citizen access to data, co-design, and data-enabled decision making.
     - Supports open data for Blue & Green Infrastructure (with protections for commercial interests) and the connection of citizen-led science with big data.
     - Emphasises bottom-up engagement, co-design of data platforms, and building capacity for communities to influence service delivery and urban decisions in real time.
  5) A Monitoring Space
     - Uses ICT and smart applications to measure, track, and monitor progress against the shared vision and metrics.
     - Establishes baselines for decision making and underpins accountability, transparency, and learning.
     - Recommends open data and shared governance tools to support ongoing evaluation and adjustment.

- Key data-oriented implications for Data Leaders
  - Data strategy alignment: ensure the five characteristics are supported by an integrated data approach (collection, curation, discoverability, and governance).
  - Data gaps and standards: identify data availability, granularity gaps, metadata quality, and interoperability needs; develop common data standards where possible.
  - Metrics and decision support: propose and co-design Net Positive standards and other new metrics to clearly define “good” outcomes across health, well-being, equity, and sustainability.
  - Data sharing vs protection: balance open data for blue/green infrastructure with protections for commercial interests; promote safe, responsible data sharing frameworks.
  - Data platforms and citizen engagement: develop platforms that connect citizen-led data with big data; present information accessibly; enable real-time decision support and experimentation.
  - Governance and accountability: create governance mechanisms that involve both authorities and communities, with clear roles, responsibilities, and accountability for delivering benefits.
  - Communications and language: invent accessible terms to bridge silos and empower cross-disciplinary collaboration (e.g., “Net Positive” concepts).

- Practical data actions recommended
  - Co-design data concepts and metrics with stakeholders at all levels (city, neighbourhood, community groups).
  - Develop an open data approach for green/blue infrastructure while safeguarding sensitive or proprietary information.
  - Create dashboards and tools that translate data into actionable insights for policy colleagues, practitioners, and the public.
  - Use data at multiple scales (regional, city, neighbourhood) to plan integrated interventions and to gamify or simulate outcomes.
  - Establish monitoring and evaluation frameworks to measure health, inequality, mobility, environmental quality, and other liveability indicators.

- Core tensions and considerations highlighted
  - Data fragmentation across multiple agencies and sectors.
  - Balancing open data with commercial and regulatory constraints.
  - Ensuring meaningful public participation, avoiding cynicism, and sustaining community involvement.
  - Aligning short-term project needs with long-term urban system resilience and equity goals.

- Outcome focus
  - The framework promotes a holistic view of the city where social, ecological, and technological dimensions are integrated.
  - Emphasises a “silver green” transition, combining smart technologies with nature-based solutions to deliver multiple benefits.
  - Encourages a governance culture of collaboration, experimentation, and shared accountability to steward data-informed city development.
