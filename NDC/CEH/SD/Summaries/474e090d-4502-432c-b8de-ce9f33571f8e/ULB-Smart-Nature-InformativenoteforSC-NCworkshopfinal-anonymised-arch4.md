# Urban Living Birmingham

- The Urban Living Partnership (involving seven UK Research Councils and Innovate UK) co-funded the Urban Living Birmingham project to co-produce and test practical, sustainable urban growth solutions across cities, with a focus on integrating infrastructure, environment, health, economy, and citizen needs through a whole-city approach.
- Birmingham’s diagnosis highlights the centrality of health and well-being within connectivity, economy, and energy, and identifies resilience challenges toward a low-energy, low-carbon future. There is a noted disconnect between the natural environment and urban form, despite Birmingham’s Green Living Spaces Plan and claim to be a biophilic city.
- The project explores how green and blue infrastructure (GBI) supports health and well-being (the G-effect) and how smart city initiatives, guided by the Smart City Roadmap, can enhance service delivery through digital technologies while promoting citizen involvement and cross-sector collaboration.
- A key tension exists between “smart city” and “natural city” visions. Both are evolving as transition discourses, with potential synergy in using technology and ecosystem services to foster renewable energy, inclusive growth, and balanced social equity and economic efficiency.

## Key themes and their implications

- Value of green and the rise of smart
  - GBI provision improves health and well-being; cities are seeking to combine green/blue networks with smart technologies.
  - Smart city initiatives aim to increase infrastructure capacity, mobility, and service delivery, but integration with green/natural strategies remains limited.
  - The two visions require closer alignment to realize holistic urban futures that are inclusive and data-enabled.

- People, opportunities and challenges for the smart-nature interface
  - Growing recognition of ecosystem services in urban planning; G&BI occupy varying shares of urban space and are increasingly pressured by densification.
  - Managing ecosystem services faces challenges: spatial/temporal dynamics, flow distributions, governance fragmentation (many land managers), and differing perceptions among residents and planners.
  - Tools available to support decisions include high-resolution remote sensing, landscape ecology concepts, and systematic conservation planning; collaboration between local authorities and other actors is essential.

- Infrastructure and a systems perspective
  - Traditional planning tends to silo health, water, housing, green infrastructure, biodiversity, and climate agendas, reducing overall effectiveness.
  - A social-ecological systems perspective reframes cities as multi-sector, multi-scalar infrastructures that support well-being and economic development.
  - Eight principles are proposed to reconnect infrastructure within this broader system, emphasizing basic access, multisector health improvements, resource efficiency, local knowledge, cross-scale governance, and coevolution of infrastructures and institutions.

- Starting-off point and barriers to change
  - The smart-natural interface represents a culture shift requiring investment in social capital and capacity building.
  - Financial and political constraints limit traditional approaches to urban futures; private sector interest is growing as digitization reshapes infrastructure.
  - The potential lies in digitally connected, smart infrastructure that uses information to optimize and coordinate across sectors (e.g., roads adapted for autonomous transport).

## Data leadership perspectives and actions

- View the city as an integrated data system: combine health, environmental, infrastructure, and social data across sectors to support holistic decision-making.
- Map data availability and gaps: assess what data exists on ecosystem services, green/blue infrastructure, health outcomes, and urban form; identify where data are missing or incomplete at the required granularity.
- Enable co-ownership of data products: foster collaboration with public-sector colleagues, service providers, and communities to co-create data assets that meet user needs and support transparent governance.
- Leverage advanced data tools: use high-resolution remote sensing, geospatial analytics, and landscape ecology data to model ecosystem services, urban form, and resource flows; apply systematic planning approaches to inform interventions.
- Break silos through governance and standards: develop cross-sector data standards, metadata, and discoverability controls to ensure data quality, comparability, and reuse across city departments and partners.
- Build capacity and practices: invest in skills and processes for analytical rigor, dissemination, and iterative feedback loops to ensure data products drive outcomes aligned with health, equity, and sustainability objectives.
- Foster communities of practice: encourage collaboration among local authorities, researchers, and industry to share methods, data, and lessons learned, accelerating the co-design of smart-nature interventions.
