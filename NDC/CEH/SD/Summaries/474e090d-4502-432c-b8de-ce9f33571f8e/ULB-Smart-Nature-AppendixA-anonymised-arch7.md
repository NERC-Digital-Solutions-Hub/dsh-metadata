# Appendix A: The Meta-Table - Capturing the results of the stages in the methodology and their contribution to the development of the 5 characteristics of the Smart City-Natural City interface

## Overview
- Purpose: A meta-table that links literature inputs, workshop discussions, and deeper-dive validations to the final 5 characteristics of the Smart City-Natural City interface.
- Structure: Columns (A–F) capture thematic inputs, group discussions, action suggestions, collected summaries, deeper-dive validations, and the final 5 characteristics. It shows how comments evolved into the five characteristics and how consensus was reached.

## The 5 characteristics (Final 5 characteristics)
### 1) Connectivity Space
- What it is: A space where people, digital technology, and nature connect across places to improve performance; emphasizes social connectivity and the interconnection of city, people, and nature.
- GIS implications: Map social networks, flows, and access; depict intersections between grey, green, and blue infrastructure; identify gaps in connectivity.
- Key insights from the workshop: Focus on bringing environment thinking into planning decisions; address coordination across time and place; identify data needed to reveal connections.

### 2) Visionary Space
- What it is: A clear, bold city vision with pathways to desired outcomes; emphasizes planning steps, data needs, and measurable progress.
- GIS implications: Develop scenario and pathway maps; chart data requirements and data collection steps; visualize future states and interventions.
- Key insights from the workshop: Create a shared, long-term vision with stepwise challenges; co-design metrics and data to avoid data overload; establish a net-positive metrics framework.

### 3) Place-making / Place-keeping Space
- What it is: A space focused on place-making and sustaining places over time; integrates social, environmental, and infrastructural objectives; emphasizes governance, devolution, and community networks.
- GIS implications: Map networks of green/blue infrastructure, community assets, and land-use changes; visualize governance boundaries and co-benefits; support open data for planning and monitoring.
- Key insights from the workshop: Network spaces across the city; involve communities in design and management; acknowledge governance complexities and the need for shared value across sectors.

### 4) Smart Citizen-led Space
- What it is: A space where citizens access and use data to influence decisions; promotes open data, citizen-led science, co-design, and shared accountability.
- GIS implications: Build participatory maps and citizen data portals; integrate crowdsourced data with official datasets; design dashboards that reflect citizen inputs alongside policy data.
- Key insights from the workshop: Data-enabled empowerment, bottom-up innovation, and mechanisms for communities to network ideas with health, housing, and development data.

### 5) Monitoring Space
- What it is: A space using ICT and smart applications to measure, track, and monitor progress; provides baseline data for decision-making and accountability.
- GIS implications: Real-time dashboards; sensor integration; spatial-temporal monitoring of green/grey infrastructure; develop and track Net Positive standards.
- Key insights from the workshop: Use data to reveal progress, inform decisions, and drive governance; ensure data and metrics are accessible and interpretable.

## Cross-cutting themes for GIS practice
- Whole-city approach and place-making/place-keeping as core principles.
- Integration of Green Infrastructure (GI) with smart city concepts (the Silver Green idea: combining smart technologies with nature).
- Data strategy: co-designed metrics (e.g., Net Positive standards), open data, data interoperability, and multi-scale data fusion.
- Governance and accountability: balancing authority with community involvement; addressing risk and long-term commitments.
- Stakeholders: alignment among end users, decision-makers, communities, and business partners; iterative testing and prototyping.

## Data products and mapping opportunities for GIS
- Connectivity Map: layers for human mobility, social networks, and green/blue corridors; identify pinch-points and opportunities for integrated interventions.
- Vision Scenario Maps: spatial representations of desired futures, pathway steps, and data needs for each step.
- Place-making / Place-keeping Maps: networks of green spaces, public spaces, infrastructure, and governance boundaries; co-produced spaces with community inputs.
- Smart Citizen-led Maps: participatory/ crowdsourced maps, data portals, and citizen-driven indicators linked to policy outcomes.
- Monitoring Dashboards: KPI and Net Positive standards dashboards; real-time sensor data integration; spatial dashboards showing progress and where interventions are needed.

## Data challenges and considerations for GIS teams
- Data fragmentation and multiple data custodians; inconsistent standards; varying resolutions.
- Cleaning, transforming, and harmonizing datasets across scales (local to regional).
- Privacy, consent, and governance: balancing openness with commercial, security, and rights considerations.
- Sustaining data quality and availability to support long-term place-making and monitoring.
- Engaging end users iteratively: prototyping, testing, and refining maps and dashboards based on feedback.

## Takeaways for GIS-focused practitioners
- Build a cohesive map-based representation of the five characteristics to communicate the Smart City-Natural City interface.
- Align data layers and metrics with Net Positive standards and the “silver green” concept to demonstrate multiple benefits (health, equity, economy, environment).
- Design interactive, participatory mapping workflows that empower communities while informing policy and investment decisions.
- Ensure multi-scale data integration to support a whole-city perspective, from neighborhood to city-wide planning.
- Use the meta-table’s framework to validate data products: trace how inputs inform the five characteristics and how stakeholder feedback refines the mapping outputs.
