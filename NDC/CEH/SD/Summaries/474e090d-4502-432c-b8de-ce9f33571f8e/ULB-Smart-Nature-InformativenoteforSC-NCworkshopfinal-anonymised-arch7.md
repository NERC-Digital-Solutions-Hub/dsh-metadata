# Introduction

- Global urbanization context: 54% of the world’s population in cities (rising to 66% by 2050); focus on sustainable city form, health, and resilience. The Urban Living Birmingham (ULB) project seeks to co-produce practical, city-wide solutions for sustainable urban growth with cross-disciplinary partners, local government, and communities.
- Value of green and smart city approaches: Green and blue infrastructure (GBI) supports health and well-being (the “G-effect”). Smart City Roadmap aims to use digital technologies to enhance infrastructure, services, mobility, and low-carbon transitions, while promoting joined-up service delivery and citizen involvement.
- Smart–nature interface and ecosystem thinking: Green/blue spaces vary widely in urban areas and densification threatens resources. Understanding the city as an ecosystem with spatial constraints on ecosystem service flows is key. High-resolution remote sensing, landscape ecology, and conservation planning are valuable tools; governance complexity arises from multiple land managers and differing perceptions among residents.
- Infrastructure and systems perspective: Move from siloed planning to a social–ecological systems view that treats infrastructure as multisectoral, multiscalar systems essential for energy, water, housing, transport, and well-being. Eight principles for integrated infrastructure governance:
  - Provide basic infrastructure with universal access.
  - Pursue multisector, multiscalar health improvements and equity.
  - Focus on urban form and resource efficiency through synergies.
  - Adapt strategies to different city types.
  - Integrate high- and vernacular technologies and local knowledge.
  - Apply transboundary systems analysis for localized versus larger-scale decisions.
  - Recognize coevolution of infrastructures and institutions.
  - Build capacity and transparent governance across sectors and scales.
- Towards a SMART–Natural future: The interface offers opportunities for holistic interventions, but requires culture change, investment in social capital, and capacity building. Financial and political constraints are real, yet there is an emerging opportunity through private-sector investment in digitally connected “smart infrastructure.”
- Implications for GIS practitioners:
  - Need for integrated, cross-sector data and standards to model and map ecosystem services, connectivity, and urban health.
  - Use of high-resolution data and spatial analysis to inform governance, planning, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
  - Emphasis on data packaging, transparency, and capacity building to support holistic, city-scale decision making.
