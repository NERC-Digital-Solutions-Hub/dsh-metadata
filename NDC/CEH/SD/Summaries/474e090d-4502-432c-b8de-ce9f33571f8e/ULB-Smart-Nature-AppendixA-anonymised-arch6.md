Appendix A: The Meta-Table - Capturing the results of the stages in the methodology and their contribution to the development of the 5 characteristics of the Smart City-Natural City interface.

## Overview
- Describes how literature inputs, workshop discussions, narratives, and deeper-dives converge to define five characteristics of the smart city–natural city interface.
- Uses a meta-table to trace how initial inputs (A–D) feed into workshop outputs (B–D) and are validated by deeper dives (E), resulting in the final 5 characteristics (F).
- Illustrates how data, stakeholder input, and narrative evolve to validate place-making and data-driven approaches.

## The Five Characteristics (final framework)
1. Connectivity Space
   - A space where people, digital technology, and nature connect across places to improve performance.
   - Highlights social connectivity, interdependence of city, people, and nature, and the role of smart systems in creating a natural city.
2. Visionary Space
   - Emphasises a clear, bold city vision and the steps to achieve it.
   - Focuses on identifying required data, defining a route from current state to goals, and avoiding data overload by collecting data purposefully.
3. Place-making Space
   - Promotes place-making and place-keeping; emphasizes neighbourhood-scale actions linked to wider city goals.
   - Stresses integrated planning, governance clarity, and community-driven data initiatives that connect health, housing, development, and green spaces.
4. Smart Citizen-led Space
   - Encourages citizen access to data and data-enabled participation.
   - Proposes platforms for open data (including blue/green infrastructure), citizen-led science, and co-designed data-enabled decision making.
5. Monitoring Space
   - Focuses on monitoring, measurement, and accountability.
   - Seeks ICT-enabled tools to track progress, evaluate outcomes, and share results across stakeholders; supports continuous learning and adaptation.

## How data supports the framework
- Data inputs come from literature reviews, workshop group discussions, and deeper-dive validations, all contributing to the five characteristics.
- Emphasizes the need for interoperable data and shared metrics that reflect city-wide outcomes (health, wellbeing, mobility, inequality) and environmental aspects (green/blue infrastructure).
- Highlights the importance of framing data within a common purpose to foster collaboration between citizens, policymakers, and organisations.

## Key data-focused actions and metrics
- Develop and adopt new metrics that capture what ‘good’ looks like (Net Positive standards), co-designed from top-down and bottom-up.
- Create and promote open data for green/blue infrastructure, ensuring data remain usable while protecting commercial interests.
- Use smart enabling technology at the outset to inform and educate, establishing baselines for decision making.
- Build data platforms that connect citizen-led data with formal decision processes; enable communities to act with evidence.
- Ensure data supports a shared narrative and common purpose across sectors, with transparent accountability.

## Governance, culture, and stakeholder engagement
- Move toward inclusive governance that emphasizes people, connectivity, and synergy between technology and nature.
- Reduce the dominance of traditional “authority” frames; promote devolution of management and collaborative delivery models.
- Encourage co-design of data requirements and metrics across communities, businesses, and public authorities.
- Build mechanisms for ongoing knowledge sharing, long-term commitment, and cross-party support.

## Challenges and opportunities for Data Support
- Data challenges: patchy data, data in many formats, access to disparate systems, and difficulty communicating complex information simply.
- Opportunity: open data and citizen-led data initiatives can enhance decision-making, accountability, and public engagement.
- Considerations: balancing data openness with commercial interests; ensuring data remains usable, interoperable, and timely; avoiding data overload.
- Outcome: a structured engagement framework for transforming how the council operates, enabling integrated management of infrastructure, environment, and smart-city data.

## Takeaways for Data Practitioners
- Use the meta-table as a blueprint to align data collection, analysis, and visualization with the five characteristics (Connectivity, Vision, Place-making, Smart Citizen-led, Monitoring).
- Prioritize data that demonstrates connections between people, technology, and nature; design dashboards and self-serve tools accordingly.
- Co-design metrics with communities and stakeholders to ensure relevance and buy-in; pursue Net Positive standards to guide evaluation.
- Build open data ecosystems for green/blue infrastructure while safeguarding essential commercial data.
- Establish clear data governance and accountability mechanisms to support long-term, cross-sector collaboration and city-wide learning.
