# NERC Data Repository - Supporting Information

## Overview
- Describes multi-disciplinary, anonymised experts who contributed to the research.
- Includes a meta-table organizing and summarising outputs from the Birmingham Innovation Workshop (12 September 2017) and subsequent discussions (Sept–Nov 2017).

## Data Depository Content
- Records of group/table outputs from the Innovation Workshop.
- Copies of photographs of the collective 'stickies' contributions from the workshop.
- Original transcripts of semi-structured interview conversations.
- Records of group telephone or meeting conversations.
- Work-in-progress collations of comments generated to share with contributors and co-authors.

## Data Provenance and Use
- Transcripts informed the identification of new ways to integrate urban futures discourses, particularly shaping the Smart City – Natural City interface, using Birmingham as a case study.
- Research team: Mike Grace, Prof. David Proverbs (Birmingham City University); Prof. Alister Scott (Northumbria University); Prof. Jonathan Sadler (University of Birmingham); Nick Grayson (Birmingham City Council).

## Data Governance and Availability
- Data Availability Statement accompanies the manuscript, describing anonymised expert contributions.
- Data management aligns with the research outputs used to support urban futures discourse analysis.
- Data are deposited to support reuse by others in related urban planning and governance research.

## Funding and Temporal Scope
- Research supported by Research Councils UK (RCUK) and Innovate UK as part of the Urban Living Partnership (grant EP/P002021/1) from 2015–2018.
- Specifically tied to the Urban Living Birmingham project, one of five Urban Living Partnership cities.

## Images and Data Capture
- Images document active capture of data from expert contributors during the project activities.

## Implications for Data Stewards
- Ensure robust metadata and clear linkage between workshop outputs, transcripts, and participant contributions.
- Maintain provenance records for each data type (outputs, transcripts, photos, meeting records, collations).
- Manage anonymisation and access controls for expert contributors.
- Document data lifecycle, including collection period (2015–2018), processing, and eventual sharing.
- Facilitate discoverability and interoperability of assets across related urban planning and governance datasets.
